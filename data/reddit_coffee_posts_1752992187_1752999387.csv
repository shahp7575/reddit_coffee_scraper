Everything continues, yes. The clocks tick. The sun rises. The birds sing. But none of it feels quite real, quite right, quite... mine without you.

You are the pulse behind my calm. The reason every sunrise holds meaning. You’ve made a home inside my heart, one I didn’t know existed until you walked in with that quiet grace, those eyes that saw through me like pages of a worn-out book, and hands that healed parts of me I’d forgotten were wounded.

Life feels strange these days, Sweetheart. Like I’m living someone else’s script. I smile when I must, I speak when I should, but deep down there’s this hush in my spirit—like it’s waiting for the soft rustle of your hair against my chest, the warmth of your head resting where my heartbeat races.

I’ve never known love like this. Not the kind you read in books, but the kind that changes the air you breathe. The kind that makes you softer, stronger, braver, all at once. The kind that makes you want to become the best version of yourself just to be worthy of the gaze of the woman who already thinks you’re enough.

I catch myself doing little things the way you would. Talking to plants because you said they deserve kindness. Folding my blanket with that neatness you like. Humming songs you once sang under your breath. You see, you've seeped into everything. Not like an echo, but like a presence. A constant.

I don’t want a world that doesn’t have your footsteps in it, your laugh echoing in it, your hands writing softness into my chaos. I want the small things with you, Sweetheart. The quiet mornings. The coffee that turns cold because we’re too busy talking. The shared silences. The eye contact that says everything.

I want to hold your hand through every storm and every sunbeam. I want to wake up to your sleepy eyes, whisper your name into the space between dreams and daylight, and know that I’ve made it—I’ve found home.

You don’t complete me, my love. You elevate me. You show me what love looks like when it’s patient, kind, and laced with fire. You are the poetry the stars tried to write but failed, because they didn’t have you.

My heart doesn't just beat for you. It lives for you.

And until you're near me again, I'll keep holding onto every memory we’ve made like a sacred promise of all the days we’re yet to live—together.",1,1752999286.0,LettersAnswered,1,1.0,False

Thinking it nothing more than a spill i place a towel down over the offending patch and step over it into the kitchen to make another coffee.

Yet as my unfortunate sock steps down onto the laminate floor of our kitchen, it finds yet another puddle, and through my disgust, i once again presume it mothing more than a rather extensive spill from my beloved, and make a note to call him and ask what he had done to make such a mess before leaving our shared abode earlier in the day.

As I  had expected, my call goes unanswered,  my partner opting not to keep his phone in him during his weekly Squash meet, and I'm left in my damp confusion. Coffee obtained, i step past the puddle in the kitchen (which i had so gracefully slid the earlier towel over in a feeble attempt to stave back The Wetness) and Attempt to make my way over the initial damp spot in the carpet, only to realise with dawning horror(and another damp sock) that it had only grown. 

It's at this point that i realise that I'm dealing with no mere spill, and also at this moment i realise thay i can hear something - a faint drip, drip, dripping coming from the wall beside me.  I think I'm hearing things. The wall's perfectly dry, it's in the middle of the house, it can't be wet, and yet- i press my ear to the deceptive plaster and hear it loud and clear: the sound of a leak.

My partner calls me back and i tell him to come home, realising again all too suddenly the dampness in our carpet is still spreading, the wet puddle in the middle of what we thought was our impenetrable home now having grown to encompass the entire opening of our kitchen,  as well as claiming more than a few feet of carpet. 

One emergency call to our property manager later, a plumber shows up, looks at the floor, climbs in the roof and tells us a rat got into our roof cavity and chewed through one of the pipes, and waters just been,,,, seeping down the inside of our walls in the middle of the house.  Now we don't have water until it's fixed, which won't be until at least tomorrow as by now it's past business hours lmao.

I smile like I mean it.
I laugh on cue.
I wear this life like a borrowed coat
Too tight. Not true.

The house is clean, the days repeat,
The coffee brews at nine.
But something inside me withers slow,
Pretending this is fine.

I walk the halls of a story told
By someone else’s hand.
A script I memorized too young
To truly understand.

The dreams I had collect like dust
In corners no one sees.
I tuck away the what if’s,
And nod at life’s routines.

They say I should be grateful,
That this is safety, peace
But they don’t feel the tremble
Underneath my practiced ease.

This isn’t who I meant to be,
This isn’t where I’m whole.
There’s a voice I hush each morning
That keeps clawing at my soul.

Unhappiness wears quiet well,
It hides in pretty things
In folded clothes and wedding rings
And clipped and silent wings.

But some nights when it’s dark enough,
I let the truth slip free:
I’m living in a life I never chose,
And it’s slowly unmaking me.",1,1752999193.0,Original_Poetry,0,1.0,False

This has been the worst week of my life and I don't know how people do it. I thought I was strong but I can't do this.
My husband and I seperated last year after 13 years together. Found out of a few lies ongoing in our relationship and untruthfulness on their part. The lies broke my sense of reality a bit and I went to therapy to try and work on myself. During this time my relationship with my dad and brother started to fall apart. I always felt left out and had to fight to be thought of by them most of my life, it came to a head at my brothers wedding. Even though my marriage was falling apart I came to the wedding all smiles but ended up leaving the reception early when my father's friend loudly announced she knew I was infertile because of my aids (I also found out i was infertile around the same time) I dont have aids and this is not the reason I am infertile but it shocked me so bad I left the reception. Dad had a history of lying but this was too far. I wanted an apology but dad and his friend wouldn't. I told my mum I would just wait till my dad called me but eventually a whole year passed and I wasn't invited to anymore family occasions. The only things I had through this was my dance studio and my mum. My mum was the last person who I felt loved me unconditionally and I cherished meeting up 2/3 times a week to catch up over coffee. 

Then 3 weeks ago my dance studio closed overnight and I was sad. I also got a cold and had to stay away from my mum all week so I wouldn't get her sick. 

I finally felt better enough to have coffee again with mum and she was going to come over and bring me soup but she didn't show up. I thought she got caught up or i got the day wrong. I texted and called but she didn't answer. At 1pm my dad called and i picked it up, he told me to come home. 

She was gone, she died of cardiac arrest in her sleep. I can't fathom this. Im staying at my dads because his night terrors make it a worry for him to be alone. Despite his flaws to he loved my mum and was 100% certain he was going first so he is feeling like everything's broken. Im pushing my way into my brother and dads life but I feel broken too. I lost my best friend too early and I can't do this.

1m4jivj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WannaGoPlaces/comments/1m4jivj/is_sacramento_a_walkable_city/,Is Sacramento a walkable city?,"As someone who's lived in Sacramento for over a decade, I want to share my honest experience about the city's walkability. Sacramento has come a long way in recent years, but like many American cities, its walkability varies significantly depending on where you are.

Downtown and Midtown Sacramento are genuinely walkable areas. These neighborhoods feature wide sidewalks, plenty of crosswalks, and a grid layout that makes navigation simple. You'll find restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, and entertainment venues all within walking distance. The streets are lined with beautiful trees that provide shade during our hot summers, making walks more pleasant.

However, once you move away from the central core, Sacramento becomes more car-dependent. The suburban areas like Natomas, Elk Grove, and Roseville were designed with cars in mind. These areas have fewer sidewalks and longer distances between destinations.

Some standout walkable neighborhoods include:

- Midtown: The most pedestrian-friendly area with countless restaurants, bars, and shops
- Downtown: Home to the State Capitol, Golden 1 Center, and numerous office buildings
- East Sacramento: Beautiful residential area with easy access to McKinley Park
- Land Park: Peaceful neighborhood near the Sacramento Zoo and William Land Park
- R Street Corridor: Historic district turned modern entertainment hub

The city has made improvements to encourage walking, including:
- Protected bike lanes
- Enhanced crosswalks
- Better street lighting
- Public art installations
- Regular farmer's markets

While exploring Sacramento on foot is enjoyable, I've found that combining walking with other transportation methods works best. The light rail system connects major areas, and services like Jump bikes and scooters fill transportation gaps.

If you're visiting Sacramento and want to truly experience the city's walkable areas, I recommend staying downtown. From there, you can easily explore the best spots on foot. For an exciting day trip, consider taking a break from walking and try whitewater rafting on the nearby American River. I recently discovered an awesome half-day tour that's perfect for both beginners and experienced rafters - you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/Sacramento

The weather plays a big role in Sacramento's walkability. Spring and fall are perfect for walking, while summer afternoons can be quite hot. Winter is mild but can have rainy periods. Plan your walks accordingly and bring water during summer months.

For anyone moving to Sacramento or visiting, I suggest spending time in different neighborhoods to find what suits you best. The central areas offer the most walkable experience, while outer regions require a car for daily activities.

Tips for walking in Sacramento:
- Start early during summer months
- Use tree-lined streets when possible
- Download a map app for easy navigation
- Carry water, especially May through September
- Check out the various parks and public spaces along your route

Sacramento might not be as walkable as cities like San Francisco or New York, but its central neighborhoods offer a pleasant pedestrian experience. The city continues to improve its walking infrastructure, making it increasingly friendly for those who prefer to explore on foot.",1,1752998886.0,WannaGoPlaces,0,1.0,False

1m4jf6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/1m4jf6q/i_think_my_so_of_17_years_has_a_self_perpetuating/,"I think my SO of 17 years has a self perpetuating hoard/abandon habit, and it's halfway destroyed our family of 6.","I met my SO in 2008, and we have 4 children. I've suspected that she may be a hoarder for some time, but I think I've finally recognized a pattern, and I'm not sure how to help her, cope myself, and protect our kids from this. 

In early June, things came to a head. For the first time in a long time, I made a demand. That was to keep one sink free of dishes, so i had access to the water for cleaning purposes. Then i cleaned the counter for 4 hours, and my 5 yo daughter said ""wow, it looks like a normal house in here"". I continued to clean the kitchen, but then my SO and I had a big fight.  So, my ex(?) took off with the kids for 10 day without contact. It turned out that she and our children are staying at a women's shelter. 

During that time, I really tried to ""clean house"" and got rid of a lot of trash. However, I saved all of the toys and clothes (mainly what she saves). I did 23 loads of laundry, and set aside 4 or 5 large bins of toys. 

On Father's day, she finally came with the kids around 9 PM and broke down crying when she saw the enormous pile of laundry I did. I think she was afraid that I threw out all of her stuff, and/or was happy to have clean laundry. This pile was left over after I folded all of the decent clothing, and filled the kids dressers. Her dresser is full as well, although she rarely uses it (she usually fishes through fabric bags or hampers to find clothes). 

Since then, she's taken a large fabric shopping bag full of random clothes and/or other odds and ends to the shelter every visit. Then I found out that she went and bought another TV (we have 6) air-fryer, mini-fridge (we have 2), microwave (we have 5), toaster, coffee pot, and a ton of new clothes for the kids. Basically, a whole new set-up. 

We also own another home that we planned to fix up, but half of that house is filled with furniture, clothes, toys, and appliances... which are now ruined from mold and rodent damage, because there's no room to work in there. It's basically become on giant storage unit. Plus the 2 sheds that are full as well. Most of the stuff in that house, came from our previous apartment BTW.

I admit, I'm not exactly clean and organized either, so I've turned my back to this issue for a LONG time. However, I own very few possessions myself, and my issues are more related to laziness, or perhaps a passive way to claim some space for me. 

Anyway, for the last month or so, we've had like a half relationship. No court stuff (so far) and we basically agreed on split custody. When I cleaned our home, I was able to get each kid a bed, a dresser, a box of toys, and a hamper. I have a spot to prepare food for them, table space for them to eat, dishes to use, and space to play. Embarrassingly, for the last year or so, the kids have just slept on the floor, cluttered couch, and 1 bed that was clear. Often, they slept on dirty piles of clothes. So I feel better now that they get a few nights here, and I can tell they like it. I talked to my eldest boy a few days ago, and he said that their room at the shelter is full of stuff, which obviously worries me. 

I've done some deep thinking in the last month, and I recently realized that this has been a repeating pattern. Since meeting, we've moved at least 10 times. Each time the same. We/she accumulates a ton of stuff, we fight, one of us leaves, the other follows, and we essentially start over... leaving roughly 75% of the stuff behind. I'm not sure if she gets sad about the things left behind, and then tries to replace those things, or if she'd rather ""start fresh"" with ""new"" stuff (that's usually used/free/donated). 

This is the first time we officially broke up, and she's been saying that we just can't live together anymore. This is the 3rd time she's left me with a giant mess to clean up, and I can't for the life of me get her to help in any way. She denies that she has a problem, and any attempt to help her turns back on me. She takes it as an a personal insult, and thinks that I am calling her a bad mother, dirty, etc. no matter how I approach the subject. 

I have no idea what to do. She's not open to professional help, or even admitting that there's an issue. I'm sort of worried about my children too. Not just for their safety, but that they will think that's how they're supposed to live. 

I don't know what my ex really plans to do either. She put in applications for public housing/section 8 type places, and has been getting a lot of donated things. Pretty much whatever she can get, despite the fact that we literally have enough stuff to furnish 3 or 4 homes. 

I'd like to sell the house and my/our mobile home, and find a bigger place for US as a family, but I definitely don't want more of the same. 

We still love each other, have sex, and talk about the future-future like a family... but man, I don't know anymore. I feel like I have to choose between having a family together in a hoard, or continue with the breakup. It sucks. And if she gets an apartment, that's going to be 3 places she has filled with stuff. I know I'm not doing her any favors by cleaning up behind her, but I feel like I have no choice! 

There is a fairly small part of me that wants to get nasty or try some ""tough love"". Like... involve DCF or bring her to court for full custody. Unfortunately, I do have enough evidence/pictures (from other issues too) where I could probably go for full custody. I feel like that's what a ""normal"" person would do. But I love being a family, and I do miss it already. 

I guess I'm just venting. Does anyone else have experience in this sort of situation? From either perspective? Would she even be considered a hoarder, because she can easily walk away from her hoard?

1m4jd0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1m4jd0e/trip_report_bishkek_worth_a_couple_of_weeks/,Trip Report: Bishkek - Worth a couple of weeks,"I just finished up ten days working from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan!

For some context, I'm a 35-year-old male product designer from the UK, currently making my way through Central Asia, having spent the month before in Almaty.

Should you fly from the other side of the world to visit Bishkek? Absolutely not. But if you are already in Central Asia and willing to consider a more sedate couple of weeks, it's well worth stopping by, and perhaps longer if you're looking for a base to explore the rest of what is a beautiful country.

Prior to arriving, I couldn’t see much content on the city aside from this [**rather damning article**](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/141e9hu/bishkek_kyrgyzstan_a_review_so_you_dont_have_to/), and whilst I’d agree with certain aspects of it, I’d say there are more positives than it alludes to.

Yes, it’s an undeniably small, undynamic, relatively cut-off place. But I never felt bored or yearning to get away from it, a sensation I rarely ever feel, but one I’m acutely experiencing during my current stay just down the road in Tashkent (I’ll write a longer article on that in the coming weeks).

I’ll make some direct comparisons to Almaty throughout, as comparing to other cities feels somewhat baseless due to just how differently the cities are structured compared to Western ones.

How long do you need? If you are travelling through Central Asia, I'd book for two weeks, giving you enough time during the work week to explore the city and a full weekend to head into the mountains.

# ✅ Positives

**An incredibly relaxed and manageable city.** If you need some headspace, some calm, some detachment from living in a major city, Bishkek may be just what you’re looking for. There’s an air of calm that drifts through the city's wide, often quiet arterial roads unlike any other capital I can recall visiting. Perhaps in a similar vein to Chiang Mai. Worth noting that there is quite poor traffic when entering and leaving the city itself, especially around rush hours.

**Incredible scenery just outside the city.** I’ll give details of specific hikes further down, but within an hour’s taxi ride there are some of the most beautiful hiking routes I’ve ever gone on. Think Alpine-esque gorges, towering cliffs, dramatic waterfalls, etc.

**Reliably warm summer weather.** Whilst some days felt close to unbearable when it reached the high 30s, most days had close to ideal weather, with long, warm evenings to explore the city on foot. The city feels well set up for these temperatures, with plenty of outdoor bars and restaurants to make the most of it, and generally strong AC in cafés and restaurants.

**Excellent day-to-day value.** Bishkek had some of the most affordable food I can recall eating outside of Southeast Asia. Fresh, local meals can be found inexpensively by international standards, and international options are also generally very reasonable. Bars and coffee shops are well below what you would expect in Europe.

**A warmer welcome than in Kazakhstan**. Even within 12 hours of being in Bishkek, I felt a notably warmer reception from the Kyrgyz population than throughout much of my time in Almaty. Small token interactions, like staff in a restaurant asking where you’re from or what brought you to the city,  happened with much greater regularity. After 10 days it culminated in a much warmer sentiment than the often ever so mild hostility detectable next door.

**More visible local heritage.** Walking around Bishkek, you feel like you observe more traditional cultural elements than perhaps in Almaty. You’ll see men of all ages still proudly sporting the distinctive *Ak-Kalpak* hats going about their daily business, and elder women tending to dress more conservatively, with perhaps less visible contemporary influences.

**A gateway to the rest of the country.** Kyrgyzstan is increasing in popularity as a destination to explore some spectacular outdoor sights. You’re well based in Bishkek to head up to [**Issyk-Kul**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nkTCDLMKEgZQW4LGA) some three hours to the east, the [**Sary-Chelek Biosphere Reserve**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cfcYgVXjBG3rRgZP8) in the west, and the Pamir-Alai Mountain Range on the southern border with Tajikistan.

# 👎🏻 Negatives

**Not a lively place.** There's no denying that it's a quiet and underwhelming city. Everything feels like it's moving about 25% slower in Bishkek, which is not inherently a bad thing, but doesn't necessarily make for a compelling place to in isolation. By most standards it's barely a city.

**Infrastructure is noticeably worse than in central Almaty.** Half the city feels like it's currently being dug up, as there appears to be a real, active effort to upgrade much of the city's infrastructure. However, this means large portions feel like a building site, with no real detectable urgency for getting the work finished. Away from the construction, you'll frequently encounter pavements and roads that look like they were once laid in the 1950s and not touched since. Whilst Almaty's metro only has a single line and serves a small proportion of the city, its existence still provides a way of traversing its urban core, with nothing akin in Bishkek.

**An underwhelming choice of accommodation.** Good quality, modern one-bedroom apartments are in short supply in Bishkek, at least via conventional short-term rental sites like Airbnb, so finding a place you'd be excited about spending a month or longer in may be challenging. Unremarkable but decent one-beds were looking at around £60 a night, which feels grossly overpriced considering typical costs in the city. Lots of new residential buildings are springing up across the city so this may change in the coming years but you're likely better off looking for hotels for a short trip.

**Fewer higher-end dining options than Almaty.** Bishkek feels like it's missing an equivalent of the ABR group, which seems to have led the way in higher-end Western dining in Almaty. This chain is the epitome of corporate gentrification, but they do appear to have helped raise the bar in terms of standards. The cities speciality coffee scene is very much still in its infancy, with only a couple of places of note.

**Getting to the mountains is a little more inconvenient.** Being able to explore the countryside is a little more difficult than in Almaty, where you can begin trails immediately on the cities perimeter. With a taxi ride of close to an hour, it’s likely to be more of a weekend excursion rather than something you can squeeze into the midweek. The extra distance also keeps them from feeling like part of the cityscape, often covered by haze and clouds throughout the day.

**Often horrendous air quality.** Bishkek suffers from incredibly poor air quality, heightened during the winter months due to the pervasiveness of coal burning. During the peak of summer, it wasn’t anything I could personally detect, and I didn’t struggle to do any strenuous exercise outside.

# 💻 Where to work

There's a decent number of coworking spaces spread throughout Bishkek, but without knowing your way around the city, it can be challenging to ascertain where to place yourself simply by searching on Google Maps.

[**Technopark**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bYHCsiuMeNdLHcFb7) and [**Collab Coworking**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6qdUtRRuzBU1czMWA) look like two of the best options, but both are significantly away from the city centre, with poor accommodation options nearby. The Ololo chain emerged as the best bet, with several sites dispersed across the city, i opted for the site at [**OlolohausErkindik**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WAe1HvDMp5g2dBgs5).

The site primarily houses a range of private offices, but it has around 12 hot-desking spaces spread across two areas on the ground floor of the building. Each desk has comfortable, proper office chairs and provides adequate space. There's complimentary coffee in the kitchen with some decent espresso, the air conditioning is powerful throughout the day, and the atmosphere is calm, professional, and welcoming.

The space was impeccably clean and well-maintained every day I was there and felt comfortably below capacity while maintaining enough day-to-day ambience. The only drawback is there isn’t much in the way of local amenities in the immediate area, with the nearest proper commercial zone about a ten-minute walk from the property, which you can zip to on a Yandez scooter in a few minutes.

A week cost £30 and gave you access to the space 24/7, with some people working there at weekends. I'd happily recommend it and sufficiently good enough to choose accommodation within walking distance.

# 🏠 Where to stay

Similar to Almaty, Bishkek feels incredibly dispersed. Everything is fairly spread out, with nowhere particularly acting like a traditional urban hub. I've struggled to locate meaningful neighbourhoods to refer to, with the two largest districts, *Lenin* and *Oktyabr*, covering too much space to give any meaningful reference points.

If I had to give any rough guidance, it would be to find somewhere south of Jibek Jolu Ave, north of the train station, and then be within commuting distance of wherever you plan to work from. Without a great deal of quality accommodation options on the market, you likely won't be able to be too picky with where you opt for. Thankfully, I don't think that level of precision is too required in the city.

If I could pick anywhere to prioritise, I’d opt for being around Erkindik Ave. It's not immediately obvious when looking on Google Maps, but just north of the main railway station is probably the nicest area in the city. You have a good selection of coffee shops and bars like White Night and No Name Bar, and it's not a far walk to the more commercial area of the city centre.

Taxis are cheap and Yandex scooters make getting around painless, so I wouldn't agonise too much on where to base yourself.

You are best off reaching the [National Park ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/34KNBadhmh1pLNvJ6)by taxi or driving yourself, which should take around an hour and cost about £10 via Yandex. 

I had rather low expectations in terms of what to expect from the park's infrastructure, but this was one of the most impressive and well-organised sites that I've visited. Upon reaching the park, there is approximately a £2 entrance fee, payable by card at modern terminals with QR code turnstiles. 

Once inside, a small coach will take you up to the first set of trails and paths, with a further series of small golf buggy-style carts to ferry you further up to additional walking routes, all included as part of the entrance fee. At each of the small bus stops, there are small markets and coffee shops to pick up any goods you may need.

I headed up alongside the riverside path in the main valley for a mile or two, before looping back and heading up towards the Aksay Waterfall which isn't too demanding but a good workout if out all day in the sun. Some small shops to buy food and drinks near the bus station at each stop.

Once you have returned to the main entrance of the park, there are regular buses taking you back to the city centre, which are likely to be just as quick as waiting to call a taxi and cost only 50 som. 

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People

Within my first 24 hours in the city, I picked up on more international accents than throughout the entire month I spent in Almaty. Perhaps due to the nightlife being concentrated across a smaller number of venues, you’re more likely to cross paths with fellow foreigners. But even when hiking in the mountains, I encountered a much wider variety of people than at any point in Kazakhstan.

The city's population features a similar split between native Kyrgyz and ethnic Russians, and in general English felt surprisingly more widely spoken. Whilst its use is likely much more limited among older generations, I felt a marked improvement in the ability to communicate in restaurants, cafés, and within the coworking space.

Perhaps as a result of this, I felt a much warmer reception from the Kyrgyz people. There was still a little distance from the men, but perhaps without the same level of hostility you often felt over the border.

With such a nascent remote work reputation, you're much more likely to find tourists in Bishkek arriving to explore the rest of Kyrgyzstan than any remote workers in the coworking spaces. There's a small expat community in the city, mainly working for NGOs based there.

# ☕️ Food & Drink

[**The No Name Bar**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/awsWU3ZooCi7XpBn6) \- What felt like one of the most popular bars in the city, busy over the weekends with a surprisingly international crowd. Limited beer selection but plenty of cocktails and space outside, with food served as well. Open late until 02:00 over the weekends.

[**Riders Bar** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uwRBbt1DMh54ghTRA)\- If you want to make the most of a sunny evening, it's worth heading south out of the city to this bar, which is situated on the edge of the 'Airport Pond' in Love Park. Casual bar with bean bags next to the water's edge and a kitchen serving burgers, hot dogs and other snacks. Bring cash, as my Mastercard would not work in any of the card terminals.

[**Flask Coffee** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PmZNGMWxvrZGNCtk7)\- What felt like the most popular speciality coffee outlet you’ll encounter in Bishkek. Part of the same chain that has a couple of outlets in Almaty. Has a spacious and air-conditioned room at the back, which is ideal for working for a couple of hours on a nice day, with reliable WiFi and decent coffee.

[**PIVO**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XjyYYkQajG6kKkcn6) \-  Casual bar specialising in craft beers, with 12 taps and a pizza oven churning out reasonable quality pizzas. Dark, intimate interior, friendly staff, and a great selection of local brews to sample.

[**SomeWhere Bistro**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sCPUETCAeKMXq8oY9) \-  Rustic bar featuring live music over the weekends, decent burgers, and a large outdoor space at the back. Under a ten-minute walk from the Ololohaus Erkindik coworking space.

[**Kukhnya**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2cLMqZDGh5rJeMz87) **-** Modern, well-staffed cafeteria that’s a great place to pick up an inexpensive meal for breakfast or dinner if you’re passing by. Expect to get a local main, side, salad, and fruit juice for under £3. Nice place to try a range of local foods.

# 📋 Tips

* **Google Maps Street View almost dangerously out of date.** Much of the city has undergone significant transformation since most of the photography was taken in 2015. Don't rely on street map views for any up-to-date imagery if attempting to orientate yourself.
* **Head to 'Sport City' if looking for a gym.** It's far bigger than it looks on the rather underwhelming listing on [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VNoSRVzgYSjvuYZf8), has a large range of quality equipment and costs only 300 som for a day pass. Bring a pair of clean shoes as they are rather pedantic about entrance otherwise.
* **Carry some cash.** Card availability was generally strong across the city, but I did have repeat issues using a UK Monzo debit Mastercard, specifically with the BakaiBank terminals, which can leave you in a bit of a bad position.
* **ATM fees are generally low.** I used a range of ATMs with fees ranging from somewhere between 150-250 som.
* **Yandex scooters can be useful tools.** If you are reliant solely on foot, many journeys across Bishkek are likely to feel monotonous after a while. The bright yellow electric scooters make navigating multitudes easier, with the city blessed with large, comfortable sidewalks, that is, until you run into one which has not been repaved since last century.
* **I could happily suggest 'Blackrock Barbershop' if looking for a trim.** Based in the [centre of the city](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vGhRMaSnyxo3ya8y7), the barbers spoke good English and provided attentive cuts for around £10. I could highly recommend the services of 'Eddie'!**‍**
* **2GIS is the primary map app within the city.** Whilst Google Maps is reliable, it contains some missing data compared to the competition. Most locals will use [2GIS](https://2gis.kg/bishkek) as their primary listings and navigation source, which at the time of writing was geoblocked from the nation's app store, at least with iOS. You can use the web version but it can be frustrating to use with Russian being the primary language.**‍**
* **Tipping is generally handled by a 10% surcharge.** This is generally added to your bill when eating in at mid-range restaurants and above. Nothing greater than this is generally required.
* **If you're curious about which language to communicate in, Russian appeared your best bet.** Functioning as the main language of inter-ethnic communication, it is spoken almost universally across the city. Compared to Almaty, anecdotally there felt more use of Kyrgyz than Kazakh from what my untrained ears could detect. Kyrgyz is likely to become much more dominant the further away you are from urban areas.

[A view walking through the Alamedin Valley, around an hour's drive from the centre of Bishkek. One of, if not the most beautiful views I can recall seeing. Entirely likely you won't see any other people, but there are plenty of roaming horses, cows and goats for company. There's a 10km out-and-back loop which is well worth factoring into your plans if in the city for any period of time.](https://preview.redd.it/payyyuo9kzdf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3308becd3646dab31ad6ccdf7cde08d82409a61b)

[These large tree-lined parks characterise much of the inner city, connecting various districts to one another and are characteristic of intentional Soviet planning.

I'm (36F) from the Netherlands and I'll be traveling solo through Scotland end of October. I'll be using public transport, staying in private rooms (no dorms/hostels). I'm planning on having a good mixture of nature, local hidden gems, and culture. I'd like to avoid the major tourist crowds where possible. As a (female) solo traveller I'd like to stay safe as much as possible.

I prefer colder weather and used to rain. I walk quite regularly here in the Netherlands, but since it's all flat here, I wouldn't call myself a real hiker. I'm especially interested in scenic walks that are easily accessible from where I'm staying or reachable by public transport.

I love your suggestions for:
- Budget friendly stays (preferably private rooms)
- Scenic, safe and not too touristy places
- Samhain festivities
- Vegetarian friendly food/coffee spots
- Anything you think is worth mentioning

This is my rough itinerary:
- Day 1-3: arriving in the morning, Glasgow
- Day 3-4: Oban
- Day 4-5: Fort Williams
- Day 5-7: Inverness
- Day 7-9: Edinburgh (I've visited before, so just enjoying the city), returning back home in the evening.

Thanks so much in advance!

So he‘s been using it quite regularly for the first few weeks, turns out it’s a pain in the a** to clean afterwards and just a hassle in general, so we only used it for „special occasions“ since we also own a „normal“ hassle-free coffee maker.

A week or so a go his cousin called and they were talking about the cabin in the woods that all 5 cousins (my husband including) built together, they are adding some finishing touches and were talking about a coffee maker, so my husband said he would just give up his espresso maker, since he rarely ever uses it anyway.

When he told me this I got really upset and hurt, even though it is rarely ever used, it was a gift from me after all.
I was calm, but I told him I feel like he is not respecting me by giving away a present I gave him.
He told me that it was his present, so logically it is his property, and if he chooses to give away something that belongs to him, I should accept his decision. It’s not about not respecting me, he is very grateful (he genuinely was/is I know) , but it’s just collecting dust and in the cabin it will get to use so it’s a logical decision.

Maybe women are different, but I feel like there is some sentimental connection to it? I don’t know, I am still mad plus he already gave it away, because we had discussed it twice and he thought we reached a consensus (how I don’t know) and also he said he already promised - which I know is true - so there is no „turning back“.

It pisses me off when they tell non italians that their dish is not quite authentic because theyre not importing their olive oil from italy but it truly GRINDS ME GEARSSS when i see two italians going off at EACH OTHER in the comments. They cite their reigons and their ingredients as if theyre citing a paper but it doesnt take like anyyy understanding of history to know that these are so irrelevant cuz theyre all based on personal anecdotes and that you could argue with for decades if you tried.  Not only that but altering one minor ingredient in a dish doesnt suddenly make it a completely new dish lorddd. Theyre so quick to be like ""no thats not exactly tiramisu because we whip the cream at 3 mph wrist speed while this was clearly a measly 1.5 mph"" but then if someone makes something relatively cakey with some coffee, cream and coco powder, theyll immediately jump to claim it ""thats bAsIcAlLy italian tiramisu and my nonna make it for me all the time growing up way better than any of the other nonnas in this comment section, i can tell theyre not even italian by the way they cut their mozzarella"" JESUS CHRSIT FOOD ISNT AN EXACT SCIENCE, why is it always the most stuck up, prideful people out there.

 On that note, its also annoying when someone posts a recipe of a dish from their country with a specific name and then war breaks out in the comments because everyone else is saying that ""its basically *blank dish* from *blank country* ugh look it up"". Yeah there are only so many ingredients out there. Omg more than one culture has a stew of just a random combo of meat and veggies eaten with a side of carb??

It's often said that while *rates* of inflation may go down, over the long term *prices* go up due to the fact that inflation is (we hope!) always growing at a positive rate, mostly in line with wages. I also see a lot of posts about the devaluation of the currency over time, etc.

A while ago, [I discovered this video from 1977](https://youtu.be/t5XTn-I8zoc?si=Pb25cBDDcwoEsD2r) when the UK's rate of inflation was about 16%. Out of curiosity, I used [Measuring Worth's calculator](https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/) to see what the prices would be today, using [Tesco supermarket's ](https://www.tesco.com/)online prices this year.

This showed the following:

|Item|1977 price|2023 price \*|Tesco 2025|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Flour 3lbs/1.5Kg|£0.31|£2.43|£0.78|\-67.90%|
|6 eggs|£0.22|£1.73|£1.65|\-4.62%|
|4 x beef burgers|£0.49|£3.85|£2.75|\-28.57%|
|Tetley tea bags large|£0.68|£5.34|£3.35|\-37.27%|
|Sugar 2lbs/1Kg|£0.26|£2.04|£1.09|\-46.57%|

|Gold Blend coffee 4oz/113g|£1.16|£9.10|£4.00|\-56.04%|

\* *While Measuring Worth's data only goes up to 2023, unlike the Bank of England's RPI calculator, they do fractions of a pound.*  
  
I don't know what to conclude from this exactly, and of course I was only able to use the 2023 RPI data, but on the evidence of the video at least, does it mean that prices can go down in real terms (and in this case very substantially) and that the value of the currency can in fact increase? If so, why is this? Does it have a connection with wage growth, for example?

I installed them on the Fellow Ode gen 2 (if you dismiss my post because of this piece of information I have a note at the end of the post justifying it).

First off, they kind of look like the real deal. Here is an image of them: https://imgur.com/a/bNKQ2D8. However, they are not as sharp as the gen 2 stock burrs or the df54 stock out of the box. I can note that, wierdly, after seasoning them with 2 kgs of coffee they got sharper, which is the opposite of what you'd expect.

I used the marker test in order to improve alignment, even though the auger design of the Ode has its limitations concerning obtaining perfect alignment. The burrs churp two clicks before the marking on the outer portion of the burrs actually get wiped.

Regarding the user experience, for some reason (maybe increased friction due to imprecise machining) the retention is horrible. The chute gets clogged easily on both filter and espresso settings. Moreover, the burrs require slow feeding on both filter and espresso settings, otherwise the grinder stalls; keep in mind that I normally use light to ultra-light coffees for the MP burrs as god intended.

Ancedotally, I can report that both filter and espresso are clearer with more acidity (the filter compared to Ode stock burrs and the espresso compared to df54 burrs), so that's a plus. Still, I am not sure it is worth the hassle.

As a side note, you might be wondering how I can dial in espresso with the narrow range that the Ode provides; The first part of the answer is that I can choke my machine with these burrs on the finest settings; The second part is that I use the manual flair 58 which gives me the freedom to play with the dose, as I am not constrained by the ""correct"" capacity of the basket because the way the flair brews, the headspace is non existent (so I can underdose).

I eat clean, low-salt meals but add 3g of pure salt daily (1.5g at lunch and dinner). I take 20ml of olive oil with each meal for extra calories and 1g of creatine on training days (3x/week). I’ve tried licorice and coffee, they gave me weird adrenaline-like stomach sensations, so I stopped.

Should I increase salt? (I've always thought it could be dangerous for veins and blood health.  
Try another supplement?   
Any drug medications?

The aroma that hits when you first open the pack is absolutely amazing. Made it in a pour-over was surprised by the flavours. It isn't acidic like one would expect from a usual medium-dark roast. The beutiful butterscotch combined with the plum, just perfect. Overall loved it although I think it's a bit pricy💸 but not bad for a blind buy

Tried divination twice (first time I did, and second time asked my friend) and both readings told that she definitely has egoistic interest in him (not like real love/crush, but more like she likes his company, makes her feel better so she’s going to use him as a “surrogate” bf if you know what I mean).

just wanted to say hello after joining this wonderful community. I am a newbie in the moka world, however - already owning a few moka pots. Started with a cheap off-brand (Venus knockoff) for 4 cups, then I bought the OG (Bialetti Rainbow) but currently more and more leaning towards Le Officine (Le Offitek) brand as it seems to me like a bit better option with a better manufacturing.. and nice design.

As for the coffee, I am not really an ordinary user, I like to experiment even with lighter roasted beans - but as said, I am still a newbie so my experience might change once I'll get more and more coffees out of my moka.

Or spent 10 minutes looking for your phone… only to find it’s been in your hand the whole time? Welcome to r/LittleLaughsLoungeA, where the best stories aren’t about grand adventures—they’re about the tiny, absurd, “did that really just happen?” blips that make life feel human.​This isn’t a place for polished anecdotes (though if you did accidentally wear two different shoes to the grocery store and no one noticed? Legendary). It’s for the person who laughed so hard at their own joke they snorted juice out their nose. The coworker who tried to “sneak” a snack in a meeting, only to drop a chip on their keyboard. The brave soul who attempted a TikTok dance and ended up tripping over their own feet… then rewatched the video 10 times because it was “funnier than the original.”​Share your daily mishaps: “Forgot it was casual Friday. Showed up in a suit. The intern said I looked like ‘a penguin at a beach party.’ I’ll take it.” Celebrate the small wins: “Finally mastered the art of microwaving popcorn without burning it. Cue the victory dance (and a few kernels stuck in my hair).” Ask the burning questions: “Is it just me, or does ‘adulting’ sometimes mean pretending you meant to do that thing you clearly messed up?”​We get it. Life’s full of moments that make you go “ugh”… then “lol.” Like when you spent 20 minutes styling your hair, stepped outside, and a gust of wind turned it into a bird’s nest. Or when you tried to be fancy and make avocado toast, but the avocado was rock hard. But those are the stories that stick—because they’re yours.​Grab your sense of humor (and maybe a tissue for the snort-laughs). Let’s swap tales about the time you called your teacher “mom” or mistook a stranger for a friend and waved like a maniac. Here, the messier the story, the better.

1m4itg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ScenicAbattoir/comments/1m4itg1/nowhere_to_hide_ch6/,Nowhere to Hide - Ch6,"The front door hits the frame like a warning shot. You jolt awake, heart thudding, one cheek glued to the pillow. Groaning, you pull the sheet over your head like it might block out reality.

Your mom didn’t say a word before leaving. That’s worse somehow. The silent treatment wrapped in passive-aggressive slamming and drawers yanked just a little too hard. It’s loud enough to register, quiet enough to be deniable. Your heart already ratcheting up like it knows what kind of day this will be.

The kitchen is still buzzing with your mom’s leftover fury. The scent of stale coffee, too much perfume. The floorboards creak with old arguments. You know the routine.

A passive-aggressive sticky note sits on the counter in all-caps blue ink: “

I’D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WERE HERE WHEN I GET HOME. Chores: Dishes. Take out the trash. Don’t burn the house down.”

Your stomach grumbles, so you make a jam sandwich as pathetic as you feel. Just white bread and red goo, bleeding through the crust. You eat absently, standing at the counter. You’re staring at the sink like it might blink first.

You flip the TV on, flopping onto the couch. Springer. Some dude yelling about how his wife cheated with her twin sister or something. Trash TV, bottom-shelf humanity. You leave it on. The noise keeps the silence from being too loud.

But the day stretches on, and the longer you sit still, the more your skin crawls. Like if you don’t move, you might crack open.

You think of the note. You eye the door. 

Enough of this. 

Twenty minutes later, you’re out the door, hot pavement under worn sneakers. Cracked sidewalks. The valley heat wraps around you like a punishment, but at least you’re somewhere else.

There’s the little shopping plaza a few blocks down. The usuals: liquor store, check-cashing place, cheap restaurant, and a handful of half-dead shops clinging to life like teeth in a dream.

You poke into a grocery store, asking the sleepy-looking cashier if they’re hiring. He gives you a form and shrugs. No eye contact. Probably not.

Next, an auto shop, mostly because the sign in the window says NOW HIRING in faded vinyl. You fumble through some dumb conversation about customer service and “do you know anything about carburetors?”
You lie. Badly. 

You think about hitting Taco Bell. Think about that weird meat paste smell clinging to your skin and hair and clothes forever. Think about a headset digging into your scalp while you upsell nacho fries to a guy with a neck tattoo.

You keep walking.

And then, in the farthest corner of the lot, almost hidden. A thrift store. 

The bell jingles. The smell hits you like déjà vu: Old books, mothballs, couch cushions with long-term grudges. The air freshener’s doing its best. It’s not enough.

You wander. Scarves in a basket like discarded skins. Bins of plastic jewelry clacking like broken promises. A row of one-eyed teddies and naked Barbies slumped in existential defeat. Fluorescent lights hum overhead like they’re sick of trying.

Behind the counter, a young woman leans on one elbow, idly flipping through a dog-eared magazine with chipped black nails. Shaved sides, messy ponytail. Nose ring and thick black eyeliner. A scar runs the length of one forearm, and her hands look like they’ve hit things: walls, people, expectations.

She doesn’t look up as you approach her.

“We don’t have a public washroom, sorry.”

“Uh, no. I, uh… I was wondering if you were hiring?”

She eyes you sideways. One brow lifts.

“You looking for something to do, or just hiding from your life?”

You pause. 

“…Both?”

You read her name tag. Beth. Her gaze softens just as a lopsided grin curls across her face. Not kind, not cruel. More like a nod of recognition. 

“You look like you’ve got the right amount of disappointment in humanity. Lemme grab you an application.”

You laugh, surprised you still can.

Beth ducks under the counter, and pulls out a clipboard. “APPLICATION” is written across the top in Sharpie. The form’s been photocopied so many times it looks like a ghost.

“Don’t fill it out too honestly. Management hates introspection.”

You fill it out at the counter while she watches. For once, the scrutiny doesn’t make you shrink.

“You ever worked retail?”

You glance up. “No, but I’ve got a pulse and a can-do attitude.”

Beth snorts, watching you like she’s trying to figure out if you’re trouble or just a mirror.

“You live around here?”

“Yeah. Just moved in next door to some band. Houseful of guys who never shut up.”

Beth grunts. “Oof. Every neighborhood’s got one. Let me guess, they think they’re gonna change the world? I just hope they’re not into ska.”

“No, not ska, thank fuck.”

“Got a name?”

“Stevie.”

“Cool. Like Nicks. Or Ray Vaughn. Or Wonder. Pick your fighter.”

Ding. The bell rings again. In walks a guy with beat-up shell toes and that worn, lived-in charm. He nods to Beth.

“Carl in?”

She thumbs over her shoulder. “In the back”

He turns to you, clocking your shirt.

“Sisters of Mercy. Right on. What else are you into?”

“Right now? Belly and Sonic Youth are on repeat. Maybe a little Faith No More when I need to sweat it out.”

He gives an approving nod.

“Hell yeah. That’s a good combo. Ever get into Love and Rockets?”

“A little, but I’m more into Bauhaus and Pete’s solo stuff.”

Beth snorts. “Wow. David, should I leave you two alone with the vinyl?”

You go red. “What? No, I mean, I just-“

David laughs. 

“Later Beth.” 

He throws you a nod on his way by as he drifts off. Beth leans in conspiratorially. 

“Don’t worry. He’s harmless. For a guy. I’ve known him forever. Carl’s his uncle.”

You finish the form, sliding it across the counter. Beth doesn’t even look at it.

“I’ll give this to my boss, but honestly, you’re basically a shoo-in. No one’s fighting for this gig.”

You mumble a thanks and slip back outside.

You don’t have the job. Not yet. But your lungs feel lighter. The morning’s rot has worn off.

The light outside has gone that particular shade of gold that makes even Bakersfield look poetic. You round the corner. Home still looks like punishment, but your steps don’t drag as much this time.

Time to face the music. And the dishes.

You fill the sink and get started. Dried ketchup, stuck-on egg, the kind of mess that requires elbow grease and bitterness in equal measure. You’re scrubbing like you’re trying to erase something.

The water’s too hot. Your fingers go red and pruny. You don’t stop.

Almost don’t notice the movement outside.

But then, through the window above the sink, there he is.

Jon.

Alone in his postage stamp of a backyard. Barely more than a patch of crabgrass and some loungers, but he’s out there, like a ghost that forgot to leave. Arms crossed. Smoking.

And looking. Not at your window, not yet, but close.

You pause, dish mid-rinse.

He lifts his gaze. Your eyes lock through the glass.

For a second, you stand still. Maybe it’s impulse, maybe masochism. Either way, you wipe your hands on your jeans and go out back.

The backyard smells like dust and dying grass. The sky’s dipped into purple. There’s a chain-link fence between you, like always. 
Jon stands up as you step outside.

He flicks his cigarette. Takes another drag and holds it out toward you.

“You want?”

You nod, stepping up to the fence. Your fingers brush as you take it: electric, but neither of you say anything.

“Hey.”

“Hey.”

Pause.

The cicadas are screaming, the way they do when no one else will.

Another beat.

Jon speaks first. “Listen, about the other night…”

Your eyes flick sideways. “It’s fine.”

It’s not, but you both agree to lie.

He continues. “I just… I like talking to you. Even if it gets weird sometimes.”

“Yeah. Same.”

Jonathan smiles. A little.

You pass the cigarette between you in silence.

Then he reaches over the fence.

“And you can call me lame if you want, but I really liked kissing you, too.”

The sound of your mom’s car sputtering into the driveway cuts between you like a blade.

You flinch. That sound lives in your spine

Mom, from the door. “You coming in?”

Jon winces sympathetically.

You pass him back the cigarette, mostly ash now. Your fingers touch again, softer this time.

You smile, tentative. “See you?”

Jon nods. “Yeah. For sure.”

He backs away, slipping back into his house like he was never really there.

You square your shoulders, bracing for round two.

Your mom’s already in the kitchen. Her purse slung on the counter like she’s half-done being here. Still in scrubs. Wilted.
Her face is unreadable, but not hostile. Just tired.

“Hey, you.”

“Hey.”

She clocks the clean kitchen. Dishes drying. The faint scent of lemon soap.

“Thanks for doing the dishes.”

“Yeah. You’re welcome.”

“You go out today?” It’s not much. But it’s more than usual.

“Mm-hm. Applied at a couple places.”

Your mom looks at you, not shocked, but surprised enough.

“Anywhere in particular?”

You lean against the counter. “ I applied at the grocery store, a couple others. There’s this thrift store up by the tire place. Chick there said they might be hiring.

Your mom nods slowly, like she’s trying not to jinx it by reacting too much.

“That… might be good for you”

You shrug like it’s whatever. “We’ll see.”

Mom goes to the fridge, pulls out a soda, and doesn’t say anything more. She looks at you like she wants to say something else, but doesn’t.

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Mild Hope**  
Let’s cut to the chase: this match is a statistical muddle. The implied probabilities tell us Arka Gdynia (38.5%) and Motor Lublin (41%) are basically twins separated at birth, with the draw (29%) playing the role of a shy third wheel. The over/under 2.5 goals line? A 55%/45% split, meaning bookmakers expect a game where someone *finally* scores on a day when Polish soccer fans aren’t collectively exorcising demons.

Historically, these teams are like two neighbors who argue over lawn height but never actually water their grass. Over the past three seasons, their head-to-head record is a 4-4-2 snoozefest. Motor Lublin’s slight edge in implied odds stems from their recent form—though “form” here means “not losing to Arka Gdynia in the last two meetings.” That’s it. This is a match where the most decisive factor might be which team’s bench has stronger coffee.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Drama, and a Goose Named Szymon**  
Ah, the news. Let’s unpack the chaos. First, Arka Gdynia’s star striker, **Piotr “The Goose” Nowak**, is sidelined after a tragic incident involving a celebratory goose chase and a misplaced skateboard. The team released a statement: “Piotr is recovering, though the goose remains undefeated.” Meanwhile, their backup striker, **Kacper “Kicks Things” Lewandowski**, has been banned for three matches for “attempting to kick a ball into a drone.” Talk about flying too close to the sun.

On Motor Lublin’s side, their midfield general, **Lukasz “The Human Metronome” Kowalski**, is back from a one-game suspension for “dancing to the wrong beat during a penalty kick.” His return injects rhythm into a team that’s been as ji

Let’s talk about something we all know is coming but rarely want to face: death. Not in a grim, morbid way—more like sitting on a porch with a cup of coffee, just thinking out loud about what it means to be alive, knowing full well that the ride ends the same for everyone. There’s this idea that’s stuck with me: *life is the only path to death*. It sounds heavy, right? But there’s something peaceful about it too. It’s not a threat; it’s a truth. The moment we’re born, the clock starts ticking—not in a scary way, but in a way that makes every moment count.

I remember my grandfather once said, “We’re all just walking each other home.” I didn’t get it as a kid, but now I see what he meant. Life isn’t about avoiding death—it’s about walking toward it with intention, with grace. Haruki Murakami put it beautifully: “Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it.” That’s comforting to me. It means we’re not doing something wrong by aging or saying goodbye to loved ones. We’re just living the way life is meant to be lived—completely, knowing it’s temporary.

Think about it: every breath we take is a reminder that we’re alive *and* that one day we won’t be. That duality doesn’t have to be terrifying. In fact, it can be freeing. Leonardo da Vinci once said, “While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.” That hits deep. Maybe the point of life isn’t to avoid death, but to become so familiar with it that we stop fearing it.

There’s a strange kind of peace in accepting that. When I lost a close friend in college, I remember feeling like the world had cracked open. But over time, I realized that grief is just love that has nowhere to go. And that love, that connection—it’s proof that life mattered. That *they* mattered. Death didn’t erase that; it highlighted it.

So maybe the goal isn’t to outrun death, but to walk alongside it. To let it remind us to love harder, laugh louder, and forgive faster. Because if life is the only path to death, then we might as well make the walk beautiful.

1m4insa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/1m4insa/fedora_kde_switched_recently/,Fedora KDE - Switched recently,"Honestly, I've never really been a fan of Ubuntu - and had used Fedora maybe 12-15 years ago. I figured it might be time to revisit.

Ultimately, I've been quite surprised and disappointed by my Fedora KDE experience so far. I use base linux as a daily for work and so wanted to freshen things up a little bit  with a nice new distro - and something that was well maintained and had a good reputation. So i picked Fedora and figured give it a shot.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what's going on here but there are a few thing's I've noticed:

1. Boot time is much much slower than previously (Ubuntu/Windows/Kali)
2. Loading applications is also slower. There have been a couple of times loading programs where I thought the application had crashed because it's so slow.
3. Virtualbox seems to be having weird things happening - VM windows slowly decreasing in size coupled with weird tearing effects in the VM itself
4. When seemingly doing intensive things (like opening windows inside a VM) the system seems to kind of blow up with activity (I can see it's using a lot of cores) and then teh whole system kind of slows down. Window panels take seconds to switch etc. I

I'm sure that is due to my lack of familiarity with the Fedora environment so if anyone could potentially help me out, having perhaps solved some of these weird problems or suggest something extra, that would be awesome.

I'm running on a Dell XPS that's a few years old - so the laptop is pretty decent - and yes it has an NVIDIA card, but I just have to work with what I have.

I think I could probably suffer the artefacts, but the slowness of windows opening, etc might kill me off a bit. Is there anything that I might have overlooked which could help speed this up?

Currently, I'm just running Default Fed-42-KDE.

P.S. I've also not used KDE for quite a while (even though i previously preferred the features to GNOME/XFCE) so am not sure whether this environment would have much of a difference in performance to Fedora's GNOME variant. Personally, I'd rather use KDE but am not against rebuilding for GNOME if it means I don't have time to make a coffee while loading up my browser/vMs

So this is not your usual help request.

I recently moved to a different town and now my parents live about 150km away from me. Yesterday me and my wife watched a docu about Lael Wilcox and her 110day trip around the world and it blew me away! I never thought it was possible to do these kind of trips day in day out for 110 days in a row and that got me wondering… can I do a 150km one day trip to visit my parents for a cup of coffee and a cold beer. Sometimes you need some inspiration and a kind of stupid idea  and get going from there.

Now I live in the Netherlands and our country is just made for cycling. I’m already cycling for a my life but last years I got more into the “cover the distance with the least amount stamina used” aka a ebike. I got myself a koga e world traveler that I like a lot and a few days ago I did my first two dat trip with a tent and camping gear. I had a blast but missed the feeling of accomplishment…

I also have a riverside 900 touring bike that is heavr and build to take a lot of gear, a e-cargo bike for bringing my son to school and cycling with him bc he cannot ride by himself yet. I also have a normal city bike.. I love cycling haha. 

But now the question. What kind of bike should I look for if I want to do this. I’m looking for something a bit lighter and build more for speed. The roads here are amazing and I did some research the shortest trip (around 150km) covers about 75% paved roads, 20% gravel and about 5% dirt. the dirt roads are only for a few shortcuts and can be skipped but I like the possibility to go offroad a bit. I like to be able to build this bike for more bikepacking to with minimal gear going out for multiple days eventually.

I know there are a lot of people with the knowledge here to help me out!

**Barcelona, May 3, 2059**

From the cabin window, the Catalan coast looked like an old photograph—sun-baked hills, red-tiled roofs, and the same stubborn pines clinging to the hillsides. But what I felt stepping onto the tarmac of the renamed Durruti Airport was not nostalgia. It was disorientation.

This was Spain — or what was left of it.

Ten years ago, the Popular Front — a coalition of socialists, anarchists, unionists, and greens — tore the old kingdom apart in a bloody civil war. By 2049, they had won, and with them came silence. The new government, or what they called the “federation of communes,” slammed shut its borders. U.S. journalists, especially, were blacklisted, casualties of Washington's failed bet on the losing side.

Now, for the first time in a decade, the Spanish communes had invited the press. A quiet invitation, with carefully chosen names. Mine among them.

I expected ruins. Instead, I found committees.

My first impression of the new Spain was a noticeboard in the airport: today's harvest targets, next week’s regional transport shifts, and the latest bulletins from the *Confederación Nacional del Trabajo*. No ads. No CEOs smiling from posters. Just numbers and names, scribbled in marker or printed from worn office printers.

The CNT official sent to meet me — a thin woman with crow’s feet and ink-stained fingers — greeted me not as a VIP, but as a kind of liability.

“Your clearance is for five days,” she said briskly in English. “No photos of military zones. No interviews with foreign trade reps. You’ll meet your assigned contact at the Economic Planning Bureau tomorrow.”

I asked where the Bureau was.

“Same place it’s always been,” she shrugged. “Third floor of the old post office.”

# Chapter One: The Bureau

The next morning, I walked through a city that felt both new and unfinished. Graffiti from the war — *“¡Viva la comuna!”*, *“Tierra y libertad”* — still faded along the metro walls. Cafés operated out of former insurance offices. Kids played football in what used to be bank courtyards. The ghost of the old order was everywhere, but so was the rhythm of the new.

The *Confederal Economic Planning Bureau* sat at Plaça Antonio Maura, a faded stone building with rusted railings and a creaky elevator. The entryway smelled of floor polish and coffee. Inside, it looked nothing like the control center I had imagined. No glowing panels. No AI. Just overworked economists hunched over desks, fanning through printed input-output tables.

A woman at the front desk — badge reading **""Laura – Materials Allocation""** — gave me a glance and nodded toward an open door.

“Go on in. Comrade Navarro is waiting.”

Navarro looked like a history teacher. Grey beard, sleeves rolled to the elbows, a pencil behind his ear. On his desk: a half-drunk maté, three folders labeled “Metals: Catalonia,” “Food Distribution: Levante,” and “Surplus Exports: Tentative.”

He motioned to the chair.

“You’re the American?”

“I’m the American.”

He smiled faintly and handed me a printed chart.

“This is next week’s national plan,” he said. “Takes us about an hour to compute once the regional data comes in. The hard part’s not the math. It’s the negotiation.”

The chart showed blocks of inputs and outputs — steel to shipyards, grain to canneries, spare parts to repair collectives. Navarro explained how each week, syndicates and provincial councils uploaded their expected demands and outputs to the Bureau’s system. The GPU cluster ran the dynamic Leontief model, solving what he called “a recursive balancing act” between production, stockpiles, labor time, and ecological limits.

I asked what happens when something goes wrong. Say, a crop failure in Andalusia.

“Then the plan adapts,” he said. “We reallocate. But that means someone else takes a hit. So the councils meet again. It’s not efficient like your markets, maybe. But it’s accountable. Nobody profits from scarcity here.”

It struck me that Navarro didn’t speak like a bureaucrat. He spoke like a worker with too many spreadsheets and not enough hands. He didn’t boast. He didn’t call it utopia. He called it *work*.

“What you see here,” he gestured at the room behind him, “isn’t Marx’s dream. Or maybe it is. Production for need, not profit. Labor is coordinated by those who do it. A bit of Engels, a bit of Kropotkin, and a lot of Rocker. But it’s also Tuesday. Someone still has to move the pallets and fix the cooling trucks.”

I looked around. Office fans buzzed. Someone argued over the phone in Valencian. Another clerk sorted cooperative proposals for next quarter’s regional congress.

This was the revolution? No slogans. No uniforms. Just paper, code, and deliberation.

“We don’t believe in technocrats,” Navarro said as I stood to leave. “Planning isn’t science fiction. It’s just solidarity at scale.”

Outside, I looked up at the old stone lintel of the building.

It still read: *Correos y Telégrafos*.

I smiled.

Maybe they had just changed what messages the building delivered.

**Parse the Odds**  
The odds here are as balanced as a tightrope walker on a gluten-free diet. Both teams sit at **\~38% implied probability** (decimal odds of 2.6) to win, with the draw at **\~32%**. This isn’t a cliffhanger—it’s a dead heat. The bookmakers are essentially saying, “Bet on either team, but don’t blame us if your coffee table becomes your betting pool’s new coffin.”

**Digest the News**  
**Audax Italiano** is riding a **12-game unbeaten streak at home**, where they’ve earned 32 points and become the Chilean version of a fortress. Coach Juan José Ribera isn’t just motivating players—he’s threatening the opposition with a “win or we eat the team bus” ultimatum. Their recent form? Four wins in five games, including a Copa Chile semifinal run. They’re hungry to dethrone the leaders, but their **previous loss to Universidad Católica** (3-1, with Clemente Montes scoring a double) still haunts them like a bad *empanada* decision at 2 a.m.

**Universidad Católica**, meanwhile, is a work in progress under new coach Daniel Garnero. They’ve taken points off Colo Colo (2-0) and La Calera, proving they’re not just a pretty jersey with a catchy nickname. Garnero’s magic so far? Turning “meh” into “meh, but with hope.” Their weakness? They’re sixth in the table, and while their road form is decent, it’s not exactly *La Dolfinesca* (Audax’s home aura).

**Humorous Spin**

I've noticed a lot of confusion about their newest models, so I wanted to share what I've learned.

The newest Keurig model is the K-Supreme SMART. It's their most advanced coffee maker yet, featuring BrewID technology that recognizes your K-Cup pod and automatically adjusts brewing settings for the perfect cup. I recently switched to this model from my old K-Classic, and the difference is noticeable.

What makes this model stand out is its MultiStream technology, which uses multiple water streams instead of just one. This means better saturation of the coffee grounds and, honestly, a much better-tasting cup of coffee. You can check out the K-Supreme SMART and other Keurig models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

The machine connects to your smartphone through the Keurig app, letting you schedule brews and customize your settings. While this might sound complicated, it's actually pretty straightforward to use. You can save your favorite brewing recipes and even order K-Cups directly through the app when you're running low.

Some key features I've found useful:
- 5 cup sizes (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 oz)
- Temperature control
- Strength control
- 78 oz water reservoir
- Removable drip tray for travel mugs

The build quality is solid, and it heats up quickly - we're talking about 1-2 minutes from cold start to brewing. If you're upgrading from an older Keurig, you'll notice the difference immediately.

While it's not the cheapest coffee maker out there, I think it's worth the investment if you're serious about your morning coffee. The customization options and improved brewing technology make a real difference in taste.

If you're interested in seeing the full specs and current pricing, you can find them here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

I've been using mine for about three months now, and it's definitely an upgrade from previous models. The coffee tastes better, the machine is quieter, and the smart features are actually useful rather than just being gimmicky.

Remember though, like any coffee maker, regular cleaning and maintenance will keep it running at its best. I descale mine every three months, and it's still working like new.",1,1752994899.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

My partner pays for all the bills (he works there, so they are tax deductible) and I pay for our groceries, our 2 dogs bills, and all gifts for our family/friends birthdays and Christmas. I should add we both work for ourselves, with varying hours -his can be sporadic throughout the day with breaks in between but it’s mostly 6-7 days a week, mine changes how I want it to sometimes I work 6 days other times 4, I have a mortgage on an investment property that I’m paying off. He owns the land next door to his parents land, where he plans to build a house one day and have me sign a prenup for. Currently, I cook dinners and clean our house, do both our washing. I wake earlier to make his breakfast/coffee every morning if he’s starting work before me. Sometimes though I’m out the door and he’s still asleep.
Him and his mum are very close knit mainly with his business, she’s very involved. They’ve both asked me to do more with his business feeling as though I don’t support enough in which I’ve offered to help with his books but she hasn’t wanted to give me those reigns, so I track his staffs movement on a shared calendar to help her with pays as my contribution. But he’s still asking for more involvement, thinks I don’t show enough interest.. recently he asked me to have more of a go in my business too and add .5-1 more day to the week to help get ahead, I also recently signed up to the gym and have started doing some Pilates classes so I asked him what times I should aim to do those at to work around my new work schedule he was asking me to do and his response is that it shouldn’t be in question and I should only do those things when there is no work, work should come first in other words. His other complaint is I’m not welcoming and nice enough to his family, particularly his mum. She comes into our house a lot and it’s starting to get to me, I’m never verbally rude to her but sometimes I don’t overly acknowledge her when it’s the 5th time entering our house unannounced on a Sunday.. but she doesn’t charge me rent to live there so am I being under appreciative of this/her? My partner is always telling me she’s just trying to help us and doesn’t get anything out of doing so, so I should be much nicer to her than I am. His family is beautiful and I know would do anything for us, which I’m eternally grateful for and do like to think I show that in my own way and just want a little space. Is there any advice here?

Or proudly set up a windowsill herb garden, just to watch your basil wilt because your “south-facing window” is actually a “glorious view of a brick wall”? Welcome to r/UrbanEdenBuildersA, where urban gardening isn’t about picture-perfect backyard oases—it’s about the scrappy, sun-challenged, “is that a tomato or a very optimistic weed?” moments in between.​This isn’t a space for Instagram-worthy greenhouse tours (though if you did harvest 12 heirloom peppers from a fire escape? Chef’s kiss). It’s for the renter who drilled a drainage hole in a coffee can with a screwdriver and called it a “planter.” The balcony dweller who laughed when their neighbor asked, “Is that… a potato plant in a bucket?” The tired but determined gardener who spent $20 on organic seeds, only to have a pigeon eat half of them… and thought, “Worth it for the one that sprouted.”​Share your tiny harvests: “First urban tomato! It’s the size of a golf ball, but I cried when I picked it. The squirrel that stole half? We’re calling it ‘community sharing.’” Vent your garden fails: “Tried growing mint in a pot. Now it’s taken over the balcony, and I’m pretty sure it’s plotting to escape into the fire escape. Mint is a villain.” Ask the “silly” stuff: “Does anyone else have an ‘urban garden emergency kit’? Ours includes a spray bottle labeled ‘squirrel repellent’ (it’s just water), a stool to reach the sunniest corner, and a flashlight to check on seedlings at 10 PM like they’re babies.”​We get it. Sometimes “garden time” means more fighting with concrete than fertilizing. But then there’s that moment: you snip a single basil leaf to top your pasta, and it smells like summer—and suddenly the dirt under your nails feels like a trophy. Whether you’re growing microgreens on a kitchen counter or trying to train a cucumber vine up a rusty fence, this is where the messy, wonderful reality of urban gardening feels normal.​Grab your trowel (and maybe a band-aid for when you step on a stray nail). Let’s swap stories about the time you tried to “help” your plants by overwatering them, or how that lopsided windowsill garden became your favorite part of the morning routine. Because here, the best gardens aren’t the ones that look good—they’re the ones that teach you to grow where you’re planted.​Welcome to the neighborhood.

We’ve been friends since we were 12 years old. All of us are professionals and are quite successful in our respective fields, so I assume that everyone might have matured over the years.

For context, there will be three instances that happened which led to my situation right now.

So it started when my girlfriend (someone I met and is not part of the group) and my “best friend” decided to watch the concert together. My bestfriend volunteered to pay for the tickets first since she has VIP access for being a super fan. Months prior, my best friend asked me to purchase some merchandise overseas, which cost over USD 400. I told my best friend that she does not need to pay me back and just use the payment to settle my gf’s concert ticket, which is around USD 300. She refused and insisted that we settle after her credit card bill reflects the bill.

So they were able to buy concert tickets but with different seating areas, so technically they both come in to the concert but were seated far from each other. After the concert, my best friend tried to call my gf to catch up, but my gf lost her way around the concert grounds and decided to just go to our car since traffic is already building. This is where my best friend got angry silently without us knowing. My gf sent a thank you message and asked how to pay for the ticket but my best friend did not reply.

After a month, she confronted me about the bill that is yet to be settled (about USD 300). She went ballistic because she felt that my gf used her to get exclusive privileges and demanded payment asap. I was caught off guard and settled the bill myself since I don’t want any issues about money, but reminded my best friend about our previous inquiries on how to settle the bill but she disregarded those and only communicated to us in feral mode after receiving her credit card bill.

A month after that incident, our group had arranged an intimate dinner together. I went along with my gf. We both noticed that the whole group is ignoring her the whole time, and her attempts to make small talks were ignored, which made her feel bad. We both agreed that she will not join any friend activity moving forward because she does not want to be treated that way but wants me to continue being friends with my group.

Second instance happened during Christmas. It was our annual Christmas Dinner and we’ve arranged date, time and place. Their definition of meeting halfway is me driving 25km away from my home versus them driving 8km (virtually same place where they work and used to study). Our agreed time is 16:00. I went early around 15:00 and roam around just to kill time. Around 17:00 each of them messaged that they are on their way, had to run family errands and will be late. By 18:00, they are still not in the agreed place. I have decided that I will just go home since I am already in bad mood from waiting 2 hours and felt like they’ve disrespected me and my time. I have sent a long message on our group about my dismay and mentioned that they could have said earlier that they’ll be late so I could have gone someplace else to kill time. They tried to dodge accountability by insisting that they were late due to “family” errands and they don’t have control over it.

I went silent for almost 5 months. I actually felt bad that I tried to cut them off because I felt disrespected and my efforts unappreciated so I reached out again. This time, it was my friend’s birthday and they arranged for a dinner. My friend asked for suggestions so I gave this nice restaurant in her preferred location. I thought that it was already agreed upon because everyone was excited and agreed on the time of their arrival. I mentioned in advance that I will be late because I will be coming from a company event but mentioned my exact ETA. On the said date, I left the company event early to make it to my promised ETA. After arriving on the parking area, I called all of my friends to ask if they are eating already and what seat they are on since I am already near the restaurant. No one answered. I tried to call again my friend after reaching the restaurant and she answered. She gave a table number, which I gave to the attendant. The attendant was confused and mentioned that they don’t have that table number.

I called my friend again to ask if they are in the agreed restaurant. She mentioned that they have decided to change restaurant on the last minute because the agreed restaurant has a long queue. I mentioned that they’ve been dining there for almost 2 hours already and no one bothered to tell me they’ve changed restaurants. She went silent, offered no apologies, and said that she will share their location, which was on the other side of the area and takes 10 minutes walk to reach. I was furious but decided to still go since I thought that maybe I was wrong that I did not confirm if they are in the originally agreed restaurant.

After reaching the restaurant, I went to the table and noticed that they only have 4 seats. They scrambled to get an extra chair and offered me whatever food is on the table, which was already empty plates with sauces. I was silently fuming but kept it to myself. They were trying to offer to order some more but I said that if they are already done eating, we can just go to a cafe and I’ll just order coffee. I excused myself  to compose myself in the comfort room. After few minutes, they were still talking to each other, made no effort to leave the restaurant and was obviously done for the day. They were actually looking at each other, deciding whether to entertain my suggestion to go to a cafe to catch up and help me get my dinner. When I realized that they don’t want to go to a nearby cafe, I excused myself and went outside. I called my gf and asked for advice. She said that I should just go home because I sound tired already. I just sent a short message to my group, saying that I’ll just leave because I am too tired and might sour the mood of the group. No one replied in the chat, nor reached out to me to check on me or whatnot.

These are my friends for over 21 years, yet demanding for proper communication feels like an obligation to them. Maybe I was demanding too much from them? Maybe at some point, we grew up and drifted apart? Maybe they had an inner circle and I am not part of it anymore? Maybe telling them that I feel disrespected is a drama they did not sign up for?

I never thought it was possible to do these kind of trips day in day out for 110 days in a row and that got me wondering… can I do a 150km one day trip to visit my parents for a cup of coffee and a cold beer. Sometimes you need some inspiration and a kind of stupid idea  and get going from there.

Now I live in the Netherlands and our country is just made for cycling. I’m already cycling for a my life but last years I got more into the “cover the distance with the least amount stamina used” aka a ebike. I got myself a koga e world traveler that I like a lot and a few days ago I did my first two dat trip with a tent and camping gear. I had a blast but missed the feeling of accomplishment…

I also have a riverside 900 touring bike that is heavr and build to take a lot of gear, a e-cargo bike for bringing my son to school and cycling with him bc he cannot ride by himself yet. I also have a normal city bike.. I love cycling haha. 

But now the question. What kind of bike should I look for if I want to do this. I’m looking for something a bit lighter and build more for speed. The roads here are amazing and I did some research the shortest trip (around 150km) covers about 75% paved roads, 20% gravel and about 5% dirt. the dirt roads are only for a few shortcuts and can be skipped but I like the possibility to go offroad a bit.

I know there are a lot of people with the knowledge here to help me out!

Gloria Jean's Coffee Bean on the mid level in my view, theater behind that (out of view). Food court with Mr. Gyros and Sbarro(?) to the left of the theater. Osco downstairs. And I think an arcade was down there too at one time. It was Christmas. The mall was full of people, the whole place was decorated in red and green against the gold of the fountain. I remember thinking at the time it was a bit of a capitalist miracle.

Favorite was the balloons at Metro North. They were fun in any season.

Mission Center was the low-effort mall (Metcalf South was closer, but Mission Center was less likely to require a reason.. we'd just go walk it as teens with nothing better to do). Ranch Mart was hilariously tiny but also had a THX certified theater for some reason (before that was a big thing). Blue Ridge I only remember the food court and the weird movie theater up on the hill. Independence Center was too far away, but I also remember it as having one of the last gasps as a ""real mall"" experience. Bannister was never that impressive to me, though it had some fun architecture quirks. Same feelings for Antioch. Indian Springs had almost no redeeming qualities. Ward Parkway is a strip mall with one hallway now. Manor Square was never serious about being a mall, they just thought it sounded like an idea to try. Crown center still stands, but who shops there?? And Oak Park is really the last one fully standing. And it has kinda always been Oak Park (I miss the Godiva store). 

So - what is your dead mall memory from KC?",7,1752994130.0,kansascity,8,1.0,False

I typically buy from my local cafes who import from lots of great roasters across the UK/Europe, but a side effect of this is that most of these coffees are lighter roast, producing higher acidity cups with less traditional ""coffee"" flavours.

While I enjoy these coffees a lot, my gf prefers a very low acidity cup with the classic nutty/cocoa notes that the average person would associate with coffee. Can anyone in the UK or elsewhere recommend a coffee/type of coffee I can look for that will allow me to produce the type of cup my gf would appreciate using a V60?

I started at 133kg and got to 93kg so most of 2023 I was fluctuating between 91-95kg and couldn’t get lower 

Then last year in 2024 I had a huge cyst in my ovary and they had me on BC meds which gave me severe acne and I ate more due to this and came up to 108kg.

This year I’ve been really trying to restart myself I cut out sugar so I have sweetener with my coffee now , I try my best not to eat bread or rice but I do had it if so it’s 2 slices of bread or like 4 pieces of sushi .

I just wonder what I should be doing more or if I have gone too far past my surgery date to get to my real goal of 75kg,I am 168cm . And 29 years old 

I am trying with the water intake and being high protein 

But do I have to go back to year one eating and be zero card and sugar ? Is that the only way ? 

I know some people  take  injections or pills after surgery when they don’t reach their goals but I don’t think I binge eat 

Instead I do admit I eat late at night or don’t track it which I’m working on again

Some people make fun of Americans and our ""tipping culture"", others have the attitude you're already paying for a service and they're doing their job, so tipping isn't warranted. I agree, expected tipping is getting out of hand in America. It seems everyone is getting a tip jar set up, or adding tip prompt to their credit card machine even though they just handed you a coffee, but America has actual jobs that pay way below normal because they traditionally get tips, such as servers, bellhops, sometimes hairdressers, etc...

My question is in Mexico, or Jamaica, or anywhere else Palace has their resorts, do the serving staff directly serving the guests work at those reduced wages like American servers, or do they make a normal wage, like the pool attendants, or housekeeping, or maintenance?  How are serving jobs structured in other countries?  I have traditionally tipped at all inclusive, but my last visit here at le Blanc Los Cabos, I noticed very few Hispanic or international guests leaving tips. A table of 5 Mexican couples had breakfast and not a single dollar was left on the table. Some Americans didn't either. I went scuba diving with a Canadian, 2 Mexicans, a British and me. I was the only one that tipped the dive master that I saw.

If they are paid normal wages, I would still tip because I always have and it's kind of ingrained in me, but I would do it at a lower threshold, not 15-20% of what I estimate the bill would be, or something like that. I'm defiantly not rich, so making dollars stretch on my retirement income is a consideration. Blowing through $50 a day on tips for 8 days if they're already getting a normal wage (or good wage in Mexico) is money I need to keep in my pocket.

I'm not talking about expecting reciprocation or any ulterior motive,just basic politeness. But lately, I've noticed more situations where those actions are met with suspicion, defensiveness, or even outright hostility.

I'm starting to wonder if the customary ideals of chivalry are becoming obsolete, or if there's a specific way to approach these situations that avoids miscommunication. Maybe it's about being more aware of context and reading body language. For example, offering to help someone with their groceries might be unwelcome if they clearly have it under control and perceive my offer as implying they can't manage. Or perhaps it's simply better to offer the gesture verbally first (""Would you like some help with that?"") instead of just acting.

What are yoru experiences, and what strategies have you found helpful in navigating these tricky social situations? Are there any lines to draw, or specific actions that are almost universally misinterpreted now?

Just to give a bit of context about me—I'm someone who genuinely wants to connect on a deeper level and have meaningful conversations, but only when I feel the other person is authentic and doesn't have any hidden agenda. I know this comes from past experiences where some people broke my trust, and now it's making it hard for me to connect with new people and build fresh relationships in life.

I understand that, as humans, we’re all a little selfish and often seek something from our interactions—but I need it to feel organic. If it doesn’t, something in me gets triggered and I completely shut down.

Alongside Crow & Pebble this is in my top two houses (don’t make me choose). Here is a broad selection of the samples I have tried. You can get 3 for £13 or 6 for £24 and each parcel arrives beautifully packaged with each vial in a small mesh bag and they come with a random art print from the shop which is a lovely addition. I understand there is also an Etsy shop by the same seller with the same name but I will usually default to their own storefront website as I know the seller can experience fees in places like Etsy. All my purchases have arrived as expected and within stated turn around times.

While I’ve tried to vary my samples to explore what scents I do and don’t like I’ve still been led a little by my preferences so if none of the below appeal I still recommend having a look at the selection.

Preferred notes – fruits, citrus, creamy or aquatic scents
Death notes – Patchouli, smoke, incense
Normally dislike notes – Cardamom, floral, soapy, powdery and classic-perfume-like-smell

FS – Wistful Hedgerows
Strong consideration to FS – Lunar Velvet, Follow the Sun, Ethereal Flight.

Blood Moon - Blackberry, Raspberry, Blood Orange, Dragons Blood, Ginger, Pink Pepper – Strong ginger on the opening and overall smells like a witchy night in the woods, this remains mostly unchanged in the drydown. Spellbinding ginger citrus. 3/5

Beneath Moonlight - Rhubarb, Dark Spices, Leather, Almond, Incense, Vanilla – I’ve never thought rhubarb could smell medicinal before but it is a very sweet, subtle current to the incense. Sort of comforting/medicinal in a Vicks/tiger balm sort of feel. By all rights I shouldn’t like this, my description sounds odd but I do. 3.5/5

Nectar and Dew - Nectarine Peach, Bluebell, Dewberry – The floral note of the bluebell twines with the peach to create a really subtle fragrance which calls to mind bending to smell a bluebell early on a spring morning. 3.5/5

Wistful Hedgerows - Spiced Blackberry, Vanilla – I wasn’t overly expecting much from this as it’s only two notes lists but boy was I wrong. Everytime I put this on I want to shout I AM THE BLACKBERRY QUEEN. It has a strong rich blackberry akin to stewed or baked blackberries. In the late drydown a greeness comes through so the whole experience makes me imagine sidling between overgrown hedges down a country path to deliver a blackberry pie to a friend on a sunny day. Love this one, 5/5. FS’d

Follow the Sun - Sweet Orange, Grapefruit, Lemon, Lime, Neroli, Apple – The glory of multiple citrus fruits, specifically the rinds, come together in this to give a pungent (in a good way) bright orange smell that makes me think of standing in strong beam of sunlight streaming through a window. Yummy. 4/5

Lunar Velvet - Fresh Figs, Coconut, Vanilla Pods, Clary Sage, Black Cassis, Lime, Smoky Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Benzoin – Super calming scent that I like to wear evening/bedtime. It’s lightly spiced but in a reassuring way like a chai or something similar. In the drydown it becomes sort of a coconutty lotion/vanilla coconut linen. 4.25/5

Candycane Cottage – Cool Peppermint oil, Crushed Wintergreen Leaves, Spun Sugar, Sweet Marshmallow, Vanilla Absolute, Festive Cedarwood and Tonka Bean Infusion – Honestly I just get straight mint from this. Pure peppermint in all it’s icy majesty. I will note that it evaporates away much quicker than the others and would need reapplying but I also think this isn’t one you’d be wearing to the office all day and considering oil bottles last it doesn’t affect the rating too much for me. YMMV. 3.5/5

Burnished Books – Freshly Brewed Coffee, Cedarwood, Old Paperback Books, Crackling Log Fire, Tonka Bean Infusion, Vanilla Bourbon and Black Pepper – I’m mostly getting bourbon coffee from this, it’s definitely appropriate for the image of reading an old book in a comfy armchair in a cute cafe but I’m not smelling the book itself. 3/5

Ethereal Flight – Candyfloss, Sweetest Strawberry, Pink Rhubarb, Red Mandarin, Lavender, Peach Juice, Vanilla Bean, Clary Sage, Benzion Styrax and Ylang Ylang – The website describes candied fruit notes and the clearest on opening is the sweet to the point of sour rhubarb that smells almost jewelled to me. This is pure sugar and sweetness with some of the other notes trying to ground it and, whilst present, doing absolutely nothing to reduce the brightness of this. Almost mouth watering if you aren’t afraid of diabetes 4/5 delicious

Woodland Fables – Cedarwood, Leather Book Bindings, Polished Mahogany Wood, Pages from Old Books, Smoked Vetiver, Tumeric Spice, Sandalwood, Aged Patchouli, Rich Benzoin – I think I would enjoy smelling this on a partner but not on myself. In my opinion it leans masc. It smells somehow like male cosy? I think it’s the vetiver? Not sure. All in all it’s an intriguing scent of some compelling professor at a university to me. 2/5 as I wouldn't want to wear it but maybe 3.5-4/5 on a partner 

The Beekeeper – Jasmine Blossom, Fresh Lemon, Neroli, Honeycomb, Honeysuckle, Lily of the Valley, Real Vanilla Pod Infused Oil, Benzoin Styrax, Ylang-Ylang and Smoky Sandalwood – I think the stars of this one are the lily of the valley and honey with the vanilla making a subtle mention in there somewhere. This smells floral but absolutely dripping with honey. This is a very pretty scent but I’m just not one for honey. 2.5/5

Fae Folk – Powdery Violets, Woodland Berries, Sweet Plum, Bergamot, Passionfruit, Mossy Vetiver, Smoky Cedarwood, Benzoin Resin – The berries and plum in this are very playful and sweet. The moss softens it towards the end. 3.5/5

Sugarplum Visions – Sugared Plum, Raspberry, Bergamot, Black Cherries, Candied Peach, Dried Fruits, Star Anise, Fresh Tangerine, Almond Marzipan, Sweet Benzoin Resin, Vanilla Infused Sugar – The marzipan in this marches right up and slaps you in the face. At least with my skin chemistry. There is an undercurrent of plum but mostly I feel like I’m being drowned in Cherry Bakewells. Pleasant but not for me. 2/5

Soul Cakes – Freshly baked buns topped with Brown Sugar, Dried Fruits, Vanilla Bean, Chesnut, Sticky Sugared Ginger, Nutmeg, Clove and Cinnamon Spice – Have you ever wanted to spend a day wondering why your nose is telling you delicious fall themed baked goods are nearby but there are none to be found? Forcing you to consider whether you now taste as delectable as the smell suggests? A very well crafted scent that’s true to form and not for me due to sadness about lack of baked goods. 3/5 because I'm impressed 

Black Forest – Ripe Black Cherries, Forest Fruits, Rich Dark Chocolate, Molten Milk Chocolate, Vanilla Bean Infused Whipped Cream, Vanilla Bourbon, Mysterious Woods and Benzoin Styrax – What more is there to say but it’s black forest gateaux? There’s a gentle chocolate sponge base and rich cherry/forest fruits top. Rich scent and true to what it’s intended. I’m not a black forest person though but I have a friend in mind who will love it. 4/5

Sleepy Pumpkin – A Freshly Baked Pumpkin Pie infused with Soporific Lavender, Pumpkin spices (clove, nutmeg and Cinnamon), rich Vanilla Absolute, Creamy Benzoin and Sweet Hazelnut – I’ve never had a pumpkin pie or smelled one but I imagine this is about right on the money. It certainly smells like autumn with the ‘fall’ season scents that remind me of any Starbucks in October. I think the hazelnut and vanilla lift it slightly but this is quite a gentle scent, especially in comparison with some of the others. 2.5/5

Harvest Moon – Pumpkin, Crisp Apple, Warming Ginger, Cinnamon Bark, Coffee Bean, Roasted Chesnut, Sweet Hazelnut, Nutmeg and Clove – The Nutmeg and Clove and Cinnamon are pretty prominent here and given I don’t usually love spice this just isn’t for me. The apple is there dancing in the background and sweetening it but I can’t get past the spices. 2/5

Valenstein – Crushed Black Cherries blended with Lemon and Lime, Cola, Almond, Sweet Orange, Cinnamon, Creamy Sandalwood, Nutmeg, Patchouli, Benzoin, Vanilla Bourbon – This was very kindly included as a freebie. It’s an odd one for me because patchouli is normally a death note but it somehow interacts with cola to create this sparkling, spicy playful scent. Those two notes are all I can pick out and they remain not my taste but I’m impressed she’s managed to catch my attention with the patchouli so prominent. Its somehow fun even though I never want this on my skin 1/5 but cool to have tried something with cola.

Do you agree with my thoughts? Any obvious ones I should try? I'm happy to have further sniffs if anyone has any questions I can help with :)

## Key Features Analysis

The arch coffee table distinguishes itself through several key design and construction features that contribute to its overall appeal and functionality.

**Material Composition:** The most common materials used in arch coffee table construction include wood, metal, glass, and stone (such as marble or concrete). Wood offers warmth and a traditional aesthetic, while metal provides a sleek, modern look. Glass tabletops create a sense of spaciousness, and stone adds a touch of luxury and durability. The choice of material significantly impacts the table's overall style and longevity.

**Arch Design and Stability:** The arch design itself is crucial to the table's structural integrity and visual appeal. The arch can be a single, continuous curve or multiple interconnected arches. The stability of the arch is paramount, and manufacturers often employ techniques such as reinforced joints or solid construction to ensure the table can support weight without wobbling. The arch's height and width also influence the table's overall proportions and how it fits within a room.

**Tabletop Dimensions and Shape:** Arch coffee tables come in various shapes and sizes, including rectangular, square, round, and oval. The tabletop dimensions should be appropriate for the intended use and the size of the surrounding furniture. A larger tabletop provides more surface area for placing items, while a smaller tabletop may be more suitable for smaller living spaces. The shape of the tabletop can also influence the room's flow and aesthetics.

**Finish and Color Options:** The finish and color of the arch coffee table can dramatically alter its appearance and compatibility with existing décor. Wood finishes range from natural stains to painted surfaces, while metal finishes can include polished chrome, brushed nickel, or powder-coated colors. The choice of finish should complement the room's color palette and overall style.

Key features of the arch coffee table include:
* Unique architectural design
* Variety of materials and finishes
* Different shapes and sizes to suit various spaces
* Emphasis on stability and durability

For example, a marble arch coffee table can elevate a minimalist living room, while a wooden arch coffee table can add warmth to a modern space.

## FAQs Section

**What are the most durable materials for an arch coffee table?**
    Solid wood, metal, and stone (such as marble or concrete) are generally the most durable materials for arch coffee tables. These materials can withstand daily use and resist scratches, dents, and other forms of wear and tear. The choice of material will depend on your personal preferences and the desired aesthetic.

**How do I ensure the arch coffee table is stable and doesn't wobble?**
    Look for arch coffee tables with reinforced joints, solid construction, and a wide base. Reading customer reviews and checking the manufacturer's specifications can provide insights into the table's stability. It is also important to ensure that the floor surface is level to prevent wobbling.

**What is the ideal height for an arch coffee table?**
    The ideal height for an arch coffee table is typically between 16 and 20 inches, which is roughly the same height as the seat cushions on most sofas and chairs. This height allows for easy access to items placed on the table without having to reach too far. However, the ideal height may vary depending on the specific dimensions of your seating arrangement.

**How do I clean and maintain an arch coffee table made of different materials?**
    The cleaning and maintenance requirements vary depending on the material. Wood arch coffee tables can be cleaned with a damp cloth and wood cleaner. Metal arch coffee tables can be wiped down with a dry or damp cloth. Glass tabletops can be cleaned with glass cleaner. Stone arch coffee tables may require special cleaning products and sealing to prevent stains. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and maintenance.

The product is ideal for situations involving enhancing the aesthetic of a living space and providing a functional surface, but may be less suitable for those seeking a more traditional or understated coffee table design.

Overall, the arch coffee table represents a solid investment for users seeking a unique and stylish furniture piece, offering an effective balance of form and function. While not without its potential limitations (such as stability concerns with certain designs), its strengths in aesthetic appeal and versatility make it a worthwhile consideration for design enthusiasts, modern homeowners, and apartment dwellers.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Racing Club vs. Belgrano de Córdoba: A Clash of Toaster Toasters and Coffee Shots**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a match that’s as much about coaching tantrums as it is about soccer. On Sunday, Racing Club—still nursing the hangover from their 1-0 debut loss to Barracas Central—visits Belgrano de Córdoba, a team riding high after a 4-0 evisceration of Huracán. Let’s break this down with the precision of a referee who’s never missed a card… or maybe just the one time they did.

---

### Odds: The Math of Misery and Momentum

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Racing Club, albeit with the subtlety of a half-hearted birthday cheer. At decimal odds of **2.45** (implied probability: \~41%), Racing is the slight favorite, while Belgrano sits at **2.9** (\~34%). The draw? A tidy **3.1** (\~32%), which feels about right for a rivalry where neither team can be trusted to show up with both boots.

The spread adds spice: Racing is favored by **0.25 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win but not by much—like ordering a “large” coffee and getting an extra espresso shot tacked on. Meanwhile, the **Under 2.5 goals** line is the most appealing (odds as low as 1.7), suggesting this could be a game where scoring is harder than convincing a teenager to do chores.

### News: Coaching Tantrums and Historical Grudges

Racing’s woes start in the dugout. Coach Gustavo Costas, fresh off a one-match suspension for “controversy with a referee” (read: probably arguing with a man whose job is to ignore him), now has to watch his team regroup under an assistant who’s likely Googling “how to coach soccer” on a phone. His absence is like sending a chef to a cooking competition with only a microwave and a saltshaker.

I had the most interesting encounter the other day, and it's got me thinking about how we sometimes just drift into each other's lives for the briefest moments. I ran into this lady at a coffee shop—literally, I spilled my latte all over her.

I was mortified, but she just laughed, saying it reminded her of something her daughter would do. We ended up talking while waiting for our replacement drinks, and in that short conversation, she shared a story about a road trip she took in the 80s. Sounded like an adventure I'd love to have.

But then, just like that, we parted ways. I don't even know her name, but it made me wonder about all those fleeting connections we have in life. How those random moments and stories we exchange with strangers can leave a lasting, sometimes profound, impact on us.

Isn't it amazing how someone you've never met before, and may never meet again, can make you think about life a little differently? It's kinda beautiful if you ask me.

Cheers to the random run-ins and the stories we're only part of for a moment.

To whoever is reading this, I hope you have your own serendipitous encounters that leave you smiling. :) 

Love,

Normally I’ll make something I’m craving or get it but I have no urge. I don’t seem to care to much. 

Is this in my head cos I’m more aware or is it actually the food noise quieting down? 

I’ve not had any side effect except a headache off and on nothing horrendous.. little fatigue maybe, didn’t sleep to well last night but it’s probably cos my dog kept waking me for the toilet lol. Otherwise I’ve been able to do everything this week without impact…… so far. 

Got myself a soup maker today.. some veggies bits and pieces ..so I can make soup to take to work it’s pretty cool. Works a treat.

**Prologue**

It was Monday morning, 6:00 A.M. The inhabitants of Beech View Townhouses were still slumbering peacefully, and there was a beautiful sunrise for anyone already awake to enjoy. It was the type of atmosphere where one would imagine Grieg’s “Morning Mood” to be playing if it were a Merrie Melodies skit. Very peaceful. Very serene.

And with a ***CRASH!*** the tranquility was over. The jolted-awake residents of the small townhouse complex then heard two distinct voices, one of a determined stepmother and the other of a defiant, voice-cracking adolescent, arguing loudly.

“I DON’T *WANT* EGGS FOR BREAKFAST! ***YOU CAN’T MAKE ME!”***

“YOU’LL *EAT* ‘EM AND ***LIKE*** ‘EM!”

*THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP* ***SLAM!*** The boy went sprinting out the front door, with a plate of eggs flying past his head and crashing into a nearby tree. The stepmother, still in her bathrobe and slippers, chased after him, but stopped at the end of the driveway, shaking her fist and screaming ultimatums. After her ungrateful stepspawn disappeared around the corner, she stalked back inside, straightening her hairpins and grumbling.

Once the daily show was over, the rubberneckers closed their windows and went back to their daily business.


**Chapter One**

Clark Simmons stomped into his first-period classroom and sat down heavily at his desk with a sour look on his face. That wench… why did it always have to be *eggs?* He was sick and tired of them! He did feel bad about making such a fuss about it, but to be fair, he wouldn’t have to if she didn’t keep on shoving them in his face like she did… He put the eggs aside from his mind and tried to pay attention to his math teacher, but to no avail. His focus drifted back to his stepmother. She had been on his back a lot more lately, ever since his birthday in September two months ago. Always asking him weird questions about doing drugs, his social media use, the friends he hung out with… One would think that now he was sixteen, she would give him more autonomy and trust. It wasn’t like he was doing drugs, or even had any social media accounts, or had any friends to hang out with.

Stupid eggs…


**Chapter Two**

I'm F.V. Carter, private eye. I had just hung up the horn with the unemployment agency when a broad entered my office.

”Are you a private detective?” she asked.
I replied that I was. We bumped gums for a while, and then she asked about my price.

”Twenty bucks, cash,” I said. ”If you can't fork over the dough, then breeze.”

The dame looked surprised, then gave me the up-and-down, as if I was goofy or something. Finally she gave me the mazuma, and told me her deal. She wanted me to tail her son.

“I’m worried that he’s hanging out with the wrong kind of people. He acts so secretive these days,” she jawed. “I need you to follow him and tell me if he gets up to anything illegal.”

“Eggs in the coffee.”

She gave me that funny look again, and dusted out. Honestly. It’s not like I’m crazy or anything. I know how to do my job, even if this *is* my first gig. I listen to Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar all the time. This sort of thing is duck soup!


**Chapter Three**

As Clark headed home, he began to get the funny feeling as if he was being watched. He kept on seeing odd shadows out of the corner of his eye, and hearing sticks crunching behind him as he walked through the shortcut. One time he looked behind him and saw a bush shaking, as if somebody had leapt inside it just as he began to turn around. He was too scared to check, though, and he ran all the rest of the way home.

The next day, he found a strange man hiding behind a telephone pole too narrow to conceal him.

“Are you following me?” Clark demanded, to which the man replied “You’re tooting the wrong ringer, see!” and ran off.

The horrible feeling got worse and worse as the week continued, and Clark began to fear for his life, and also doubt his sanity. What if this was all his imagination? Still, he decided to play it safe and find a new path to and from school. He made it as complicated as he could, weaving through alleyways, hiding behind garbage cans, and cutting through backyards to try to get the stalker off his trail.


**Chapter Four**

This kid was hinky, all right. Button man, dope peddler, or can-opener, he was up to no good. Furthermore, he was acting like he was trying to make a clean sneak, maybe to his dive, so I continued to tail him through garbage cans, pricker bushes, and other such booby traps. I even got all tangled up in someone’s laundry line once, but he still didn’t crab that I was on to him. All I have to do is tighten the screws, then I’m sure he’ll sing. I’m such a great sleuth! It was completely worth it to quit accounting.


**Chapter Five**

Clark was freaking out at this point. Was he being stalked? Was he going insane? He didn’t know. He decided to go to the grocery store along with his stepmother, both to protect her and to convince her to stop buying eggs. The entire time he was sweating and looking around, obviously enough that his stepmother asked him what was wrong. It was at that point that he saw that same strange man, hiding behind the orange display.

Clark screamed and ran for his life, dragging his stepmother with him. Oranges rolled like heads during the French Revolution as the stalker leapt over the display, tearing the Food Pyramid poster in half. The man pulled out a gun.


**Chapter Six**

“Hands up!” I commanded. “Ditch the hostage, or I pump lead!”

***POW!*** The kid went off the track and pasted me on the schnozzle, making 
me drop my roscoe. Blood spurted everywhere.

The psycho picked up my bean-shooter and aimed at me with intent to burn powder, but the bim squealed on the whole operation, telling him how she hired me as a gumshoe to rank him. The patsy stared at her with his yap hanging open.

*“You* did this to me? Why would you hire this *freak* to *stalk* me!?”

“It was for your own good, dear. I thought you might be doing illegal things with your riffraff friends.”

***“I don't have any friends!”***

“Oh? But you sit right next to that Jones boy in almost every class!”

“I sit next to him so I can *copy off his work!* How *else* would I be surviving
English and algebra? … um… Forget what I just said!”

Aha! So the crime this egg committed… was *plagiarism!* Case closed!

Satisfied with my good work, I took the opportunity to scram, leaving in my 
wake a puddle of blood and my squabbling clients.


**Epilogue**

That night, Clark cowered beneath his covers, with a baseball bat by his side. As much as he wanted to believe his stepmother, he knew that since she didn't trust him, he couldn't trust her. He watched each shadow pass by the window with trepidation, and tried to determine if each floor creak really *was* the house settling down. What if there was *another* stalker, one that *wasn't* his stepmother's doing? He couldn't afford to sleep a wink.


**THE END**

(I wrote this more than five years ago for a highschool creative writing class. It's the origin of my username. The assignment was to make a horror story, but I didn't feel the inspiration for it, so I wrote this instead and then I put ""horror"" in the story's title in the hopes that it would get my teacher would count it as enough of a horror story in combination with the epilogue.)

I should note I had space to my left too but didn’t think to go more to the left as I thought the space between the 2 cars was already appropriate. 

As I get out of my car the other car’s owner comes out of the coffee shop and says verbatim “How the fuck am I supposed to get into my car?” in a disrespectful tone. I tell him “you got enough space bro” because it seemed a bit close but still easy for him to get into his car (he wasn’t disabled or anything). 

He says “you sure?” and I say “yes” and I let him know I’m within the yellow lines of the parking space to which he agrees. 

Then he proceeds to get into his car but as he’s doing so he touches the edge of his door (as he’s opening it) to my car door. He did it gently so I didn’t say anything because I thought maybe he genuinely needs the space and I’m being an asshole for parking a little close to him (around 1.5 feet). It also didn’t leave any marks on my car. 

But now I’m thinking the guy was actually the one being an asshole and I shouldn’t have let it slide when he touched the edge of his car to my door. I think he could have easily got inside his car without doing that. 

Can someone please tell me if I’m delusional here. ",1,1752992239.0,AmItheAsshole,20,0.6,False
