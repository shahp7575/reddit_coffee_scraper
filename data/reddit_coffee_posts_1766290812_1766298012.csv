1prznak,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1prznak/cut_off_a_friend_na_hindi_ako_pinautang/,Cut off a friend na hindi ako pinautang,"HAHAHAHAHA

I stopped for 3 years sa pag-aaral kasi hindi ko alam ang gagawin ko sa buhay. During this time, 1 year ako nag-work plus 2 years when I started college. I have a total of 3 years working experience. My friend, on the other hand, didn't stop going to college. Occasionally, mangungutang siya sa'kin ng medyo may kalakihan like 5k or less. Sometimes, mangungutang pa para sa bf niya. Ako naman, nagbibigay kasi hindi naman ako gano'n kagipit o nag-aaral no'n. Walang reklamo. Sabi ko pa nga, walang deadline ang utang niya. Kung kailan maluwag sa kaniya, saka siya magbayad. Malaki tiwala kong hindi niya ako tatablahin dahil sa utang though she did it with our mutual friend na closed friend ko naman pero hindi niya close.

I resigned from my job to focus on my studies full time. Nagsabi ako kay mama na need ko uniform and she said, wala pa. Sa katapusan pa raw ng buwan na 'yon and asked me if pwede ko ba utangan si friend at ibabalik after 2 weeks. So I did although nagsabi ako kay mama nang advance na wala siguro 'yon maibibigay (para hindi umasa si mama).

Nagsabi ako sa friend ko, sabi niya naman, try niya at sasabihan niya ako. Much to my disappointment, hindi siya nagsabi. Ni ha, ni ho — wala. Walang, sorry gipit ako or sorry wala akong mapapahiram. She totally ghosted me. The disappointment came not from not letting me borrow money but from how she ghosted me because of it lalo pa nakikita ko siyang active sa socmed.

No'ng siya nangangailangan, kung wala rin ako, nagsasabi ako. No ghosting, as in no kung no. So masakit at mabigat tanggapin na kahit pagtanggi, hindi niya magawa. Sabi ko sa sarili, it wouldn't hurt like hell if she had said no but it hurts a lot that she didn't say anything at all as if I wasn't worthy of a word or two.

Looking back, she had always treated me like a backburner friend. She's the attractive friend that I have na talagang nililingon. Being self-conscious, takot ako lagi makumpara sa kaniya. Kapag binu-bully ako for my appearance, siya, walang sasabihin kahit tropa niya ang bully. She always want to be the main character din kahit sa maliit na bagay. For example, may small achievement ako, natuto mag-eyeliner after months of struggling, sasabihin niya ""ay ako na-master ko 'yan at first try.""

My last straw when she met up with the friend she talked shit abt with me. Kesyo ayaw niya na ro'n, she's toxic, two-faced cunning friend she ever had tapos may coffee date 2 weeks later. No'ng huling kita namin, ako inaya niya sa trip to Palawan nila ng bf niya but I never received that invitation for the past couple of years because she had a main circle before me which means I'm next on the hierarchy na lagi niyang kasama sa out of town trip (kahit afford ko naman before.)

I was excited but upon seeing na okay na sila, doon ko na-realize na I wasn't invited because she wants me to come but because she wanted someone to come and that someone used to be the other girl. Naging replacement ako. Sa ig post niya sa dump account, nandoon lahat ng friends niya from her main circle to her other circle (work, cof sa bf niya kahit mas nauna ako) and friend na binackstab siya before. Me? Wala. There were 16 pictures, none of those had my face. I had to double-check if namamalik-mata ba ako, pero wala talaga. 16 pictures na may caption na ""buhay ko"" pero hindi pala ako belong kaya pala easy sa kaniya na i-ghost ako. Hahahahaha

Months after niya ako i-ghost sa utang, na-realize ko 'to lahat and made an ultimate decision to cut her off because I don't want to be a backburner anymore.

Nakita ko siya once sa Mcdo, umalis ako after I recognized her from behind. Wala siyang clue na I'm done with her because it was a silent cut off. I told my mom about it para hindi na siya magtanong about kay friend. Sabi nga lang ni mama, ""no'ng siya may kailangan, kahit magbigay sa'kin, hindi mo gagawin para mapunta sa kaniya samantalang kahit reply-an ka, hindi niya magawa.""

I panicked as I looked up from my phone and the swing was empty.

For a second my brain went blank, but then I saw her by the bench near the fence.

My niece was sitting on the ground while a man crouched, tying her loose shoelace.

“Oh, thank God,” I said, jogging over.

“I’m sorry, I just...she ran,” obviously I didn't say how I was too focused reading webtoons.

The man looked up and smiled, “Aaand she tripped. So, better tied than face-first.”

My niece beamed at him. “He knows the bunny ears trick.”

“Well, that settles it,” I said, forcing a laugh. “You’re officially more competent than me.”

He chuckled. “I’ve got three kids now, muscle memory I guess.”

That explained everything. He stood, brushed dirt off his knees, and stepped back. ""Your daughter?""

I sat back on the bench. “No, Mila's my niece. My sister’s on a field work in Bangkok.”

“Ah,” he said. “Cool aunt duty.”

“Yeah. Still makes you nervous though,"" I said awkwardly.

He caught it and softened his voice. “I mean, it's a crowded park with lots of eyes. This is the safest kind of place.”

That made sense. I nodded, embarrassed more than afraid.

“I guess I watch too much crime documentary,"" I smiled at him.

My niece tugged my sleeve. “Auntie, can we go soon? I have an exam tomorrow.”

“Right,” I said automatically. “St. Helena’s waits for no one.”

The man’s eyebrows lifted. “the private school?”

“Yeah, by the roundabout,"" I said quickly. My earlier slacking off still left me embarrassed. “She hates morning exams.”

He laughed. “Aren't we all?”

We said goodbye. He waved to my niece. She waved back like she’d known him for years.

That night, I told my sister I’d almost lost her daughter for thirty terrifying seconds. We laughed it off.

***

The next morning, the news was on as I made coffee.

“Police are searching for a man connected to attempted child abductions...”

I barely looked up and snorted. “Textbook.”

When they showed the photo, my mug slipped.

It was *him*. The same, friendly man I saw yesterday at the playground. My hands froze.

My phone rang immediately.

“Did you see the news?” my sister asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “I think…I think I met him. Yesterday. At the playground.”

There was a pause. “What?!”

“I didn’t know! I swear he didn't do anything, relax!""

“Did he touch her?”

“No. No, I mean, he just helped her with her shoe.”

Another pause. Longer this time.

“Did you tell him anything?” she asked carefully.

“Huh?""

""Did you mention any info about her?""

""We talk for like, a minute. Then I took Mila home to study,"" I tried to calm her.

“You didn't mention her name, address, school, or stuffs, did you?”

I didn’t answer.

""You didn't, right?""

Before I could even answer, she interrupted me.

“Wait,” she said. “Mila's principal texted me.”

""But yes, the suit is meant to actively diminish Midoriya's power.""

""Wait what, why?!""

""Don't tell me you didn't know, Toshinori.""

""I didn't, Nezu, if had known what that suit was doing I wouldn't have given it to young Midoriya!""

""Im guessing that's why no one told you, or come to think of it, no one told Mei or Melissa either.""

""But why is it built to diminish Midoriya's power? Surely a suit of that caliber should enhance his strength.""

""You'd think that, but you see, Midoriya is too strong, even without One for All.""

""Do you mind elaborating?""

""Of course.""

With a click of a button a video started playing from an overheas projector.

""Was that projector always there?""

""Yes, now watch the video.""

The video was of Midoriya before he gotten his suit, he was walking to start his shift at UA when a villain ran out of a nearby bank, and with a hop, skip, and a jump, Midoriya landed in the robber's path and with a kick reminiscent of his shoot style, kicked them square in the head and called the police to come take the criminal away, didn't even spill his coffee.

""I don't see how a simple act of heroism, warrants a-""

""I'm not finished.""

Nezu then switched to a different video, Midoriya had a super sized villain in one hand, a pastry in the other, and he was spinning himself along with the screaming villain, and through them into the back of a large police van.

""Uhmm.""

""As you can see by the these two examples, especially the villain that got Mario 64'd, the Iron Deku suit isn't for Midoriya's safety, it's for everyone else's.""

""I have one question.""

It was a joy to open up this little guy and to be stupefied by its simple design, matched only by the frustration at figuring out how it could possible be failing. It turned out that the original wiring frayed internally. Upon replacing the wires themselves, it wasn't long before it failed again. Presently, the heating element itself appears to not conduct electricity at all, and I'm about ready to call the coffee maker dead. 

I'm open to suggestions though before I go looking for a similar replacement. But if not, I hope this at least acts as a testament to simple, though perhaps imperfect, design.

I've been friends with this guy since we were 10, and we have a looong story. We used to share seats at school, and though it looks like we're absolute opposites (he's more of an extroverted, sporty kind of guy, i'm kind of a shy, artsy/academia inclined girl), we realized we had lots of things in common: music, movies, and the way to see the world. 

I really, really like him, I can even say I fell in love with him, he's the perfect match for me: he's a gentleman, he makes me laugh my lungs out without being offensive towards minorities (a huge deal for me), he defends and supports me, even when he has to get into uncomfortable situations with his friends, he takes care of me all the time (specially this year when I broke my ankle), he's a family guy (close to his mom and his sisters, not in a weird way, which I appreciate a lot), my family adores him, and he's really serious, he knows what he wants in life and works hard to get it. 

Every time we're together, I feel in a safe space where I can be myself, and I kind of have this gut feeling that he might like me too. He likes to call me on the phone for hours, has a special nickname for me, always tries to stay close to me through my family and friends, keeps pointing out that he needs me, isn't ashamed to tell everyone how important I am for him and how I made him a better person (btw, that wasn't intencional, I'm not a rehab center) his bros keep on making jokes about us being a couple and there's something about the way we look at each other that's just different.

However, I'm really scared of these feelings. I realized I had a crush on him the day I broke my ankle while he was carrying me around because I couldn't walk, and totally freaked out. I wasn't crying out of pain in the hospital, but because I accepted my own feelings. This is so hard for me, because of a previous experience I had with another guy in the past. I was as obvious as possible about how I felt about this other guy with everyone around me, but he ended up in this weird relationship with a girl I used to think was my friend (and obviously knew how hurt I was). This past situation almost killed me. My grades went down, I separated from my real friends and developed an eating disorder, so after that, I decided to keep my heart shut. But right now, it's impossible. When I love someone, I'm really intense and want to pour my heart out for them, but I'm so repressed I can't even find a way to show how much I care for this amazing guy. 

Now, there are two more things that make things even harder: 

First, we've just graduated, and we have to get used to not seeing each other daily. Actually, that's my biggest motivation to ask him out right now: I feel like I lost so much time, and I don't want to keep on wasting it. I really want to know if the idea of us being great together I (and everyone around us) have is real or not, and I also want to confirm if he thinks of me the same way I do. It feels like a slow-burn romance show with tons of seasons and episodes. If I don't know what's going on in his mind I'm going to lose it, because lately he's been giving many signs (the stronger engagement to the late night calls and him suddenly remembering this beautiful hand-drawn card I gave him for his birthday).

Second, my former ""friend"" making a comeback, and suddenly becoming such close friends with him. It seems like now that everyone in the class notices this strong connection between us, she's got the need to seek his attention and interrupt every one-on-one moment we have. Here are some examples that made my blood boil the most: this one time where we were chatting as usual, having a laugh, and she felt the need to stroke his face with a paintbrush, the time during spirit week where she """"""cried"""""" in front of the whole damn classroom, just for him and everyone to console her (I swear on my life, those Kleenex were dry as the Sahara dessert), and senior prom, when we were dancing to the Grease soundtrack (We're both huge fans of that musical and John Travolta's work in general), and she stepped between us. Luckily, he doesn't seem to pay more attention than the normal to her, but I swear every time she does something like that I feel the urge to kick her bitch ass up. Anyways, I can't because I have the physical disadvantage of my broken ankle, right now I can barely walk :(. The fact that they're going to the same college is killing me.

So, that's pretty much the context. I want some advice on how to ask him out, maybe to grab some coffee, something casual, but I'm not able to verbalize it. I'm a desperate loser trying to make things right, pleasee help me 😭",1,1766296083.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I just found out that I’m losing my job very abruptly. Unfortunately this is my only source of income and I was already struggling enough to get by.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I’m going to start mass applying for jobs and hoping one catches, but I figured I’d ask this subreddit and see if anyone knows of any places.

I have two years of experience in customer service + barista experience. Would love to find another coffee shop job if possible to keep with the experience but open to anything that isn’t too labour extensive due to an injury.

**Part Three: NO ONE WAS BURIED HERE**

The first thing I did when I returned to Black Rock was go home and straight into my father’s office. The filing cabinet was gone, having left a permanent dent in the plush carpet. Fucking Typical. 

I scoured the entire house after that, turning up couches and beds and feeling the floorboards and walls for secret compartments. 

I never found anything. 

After turning my house into a warzone and tidying up again, I got into my car and made my way to my parents. 

Pancreatic cancer, it turns out. 

The hospice facility is the one on the outskirts of town, the one the kids used to mistake as a mental hospital back in elementary school, winding each other up with one scary story or another. *Be careful*, they’d say, *you don’t want to end up in Green Meadows Hospital.* 

Standing here now, eight-year-old me would probably have an aneurysm. The air in the hallway is sterile, accented with the lingering scent of old people. The door is closed, and a whiteboard hung on it with *Roger Hague* written in black ink.

I think about turning around and getting in my car, driving the fourteen hours back home, and never facing this man or his wife ever again. But the thought is quickly overshadowed by the realization that the time is now. I’d leave this hospital for good with the answers I need. The answers I’ve *needed* since Christ first went missing in ‘84. 

If there were ever going to be a time that he’d tell me the truth, it would be on his deathbed. There’s no consequence except the afterlife.  

The door opens, and my mother appears in the doorway. 

She looks shocked for a moment before her face morphs back into that wall of ice, of indifference. I’ve wondered for years if she’d always been like that, or if it was forced upon her from marrying a man twelve years her senior, a man who sells human parts for money. 

“I’m glad you finally decided to make it,” She says, it’s the same voice she uses when she’s trying to start an argument. The kind of argument that always ends with her being the victim somehow. 

“How is he?” I ask, my eyes fall over her shoulder, and into the room, I can’t see him from here. 

She closes the door behind her and leans against the wall next to it, “The doctor told us not too long ago that he’s stage 4. There isn’t much they can do other than try their best to make it painless. They gave him two months.”

Two months. That’s all it would take before the man that’s been looming over Chris, Lee, James, and I like a dark cloud would finally part. I don’t think I’ve ever been more relieved in my life, but the little boy in me, the one that still loves his father solely because he should, withers. 

“How long ago is ‘not too long ago’?” I ask suddenly, my eyes peeling off the door and locking with hers. 

“That was about…” She feigns thoughtfulness, “A month and three weeks ago?” 

She says it like it’s nothing. As if she didn’t wait to tell me until he already had a foot in the door. 

Not two months, but a fucking week? I thought I would have more time to figure out how to get him to tell me all of this willingly. If he’s still anything like the man I know, he’ll make it hard for me, just because he can. 

And that is exactly what he did, at first.

Any questions I had for him were met with silence. At first, I thought the meds he was on made him mute, but after walking in on him insulting the nurse, I knew the poor, sick, old guy schtick was just an act. So, I kept pushing.

After three days of trying for hours, he finally said something useful.

His eyes were gaunt, soulless, and he looked more like who he was on the inside than he ever had before. He was skin and bones now, pale and fragile. There was something in me that was elated at the sight. Because, *finally,* he looked as weak as he made me feel all these years. It wasn’t elation then, not quite, instead, satisfaction. 

I’d been sitting next to him for about six hours when he said it. He turns to look at me, his beady eyes unsettling and filling me with a sense of disgust. It was uncanny, the feeling you get when looking at something that looked human, but wasn’t. 

He motioned me to come closer, and I did, hesitantly. Despite his weak state, I had the thought that he’d find a way to kill me somehow, maybe he’d hidden one of those huge syringes under his pillow or something. 

My ears were mere inches from his cracked lips when he said it to me. 

“It’s not empty.”

There was silence.

And then, there was the sound of his heart monitor beeping. Rapidly. 

Then, there was silence again.

… 

They bury him on the other side of the cemetery, away from Chris’s gravesite. I didn't go to the funeral, but I heard it was uneventful, small, and filled with people who didn’t like him much.

I let Lee and James know I’m in town, but I tell them not to come over. No one knows that we know one another. I think it’s better to keep it that way, not unless we wanna draw any attention. The very few times I’ve been out of the house, I get the feeling that I’m being watched. I would stop in the street and look around frantically every couple of minutes. There’s never anyone there, but I can always feel the eyes.

So, instead, I’ve been sitting in my room again, mulling over the words my father had told me before he- very dramatically- passed. 

It’s not empty.

It’s not empty.

It’s not empty.

The ceiling doesn’t offer any sort of answer, so I get out of bed and make my way downstairs, where I come upon my mother. She’s in those same pink rollers and a robe with a coffee cup in one hand and a catalogue in another. She looks up at me. I stare at her for a moment. I can’t help but feel my father’s death released her, too, in a way. It makes me wonder.

“What will you do now?” I ask, “Now that he’s gone.” 

She places the coffee and the catalogue down and laces her fingers together. The silence is tense. I can only compare it to the breath a prisoner in solitary confinement takes after finding that his cell door is unlocked, and that he has the option to push it open. 

“I don’t know,” She answers. It's honest, which is the last thing I would have ever expected from her. “I think… I think I’ll travel.” 

I nod, “me too.” 

I don’t quite know if I’m being honest myself, but it feels like the right thing to say. I can envision it, though, travelling when it’s all over, the eyes washing off my back the further I go. 

“Have you gone to see Chris yet?” She asks, her voice sounds different, layered in a weird way. 

I’d never gone to Chris’s gravesite, not ever. After the fake-funeral, I’d been so swept up in discoveries and epiphanies that I couldn’t find the time. And, well, what was the point, really? I had seen the casket when Lee and James dragged me down the pew after my outburst. I watched how it swayed a little before falling to the floor, the lid popping open to reveal what I had always known. 

It was empty. 

Wait. 

I turn to run to the stairs, skipping every other step as I barrel up. My father’s last words ring in my ears. 

*It’s not empty.* 

I swallow the vomit that’s crawling up, grab my jacket and the bag I had come with before running back down the stairs. 

My mother watches me as I make my way to the door, and the sight of her rips the words right out of my mouth.

“Do you know…” My voice booms, ""Do you know what he did?”

She says nothing, sipping her coffee. It’s all the answer I need.

I slam the front door behind me. 

I get in my car and start it, pulling out the bag phone and dialling Lee’s number as I speed to his house. 

“Hello?”

“Is James with you?” I yell into the phone.

“Is James- Yeah, he is, why?”

“I’m on my way. Meet me at the end of your road.” I reply, yanking the wheel left as I make a turn. 

“Matt, what’s going on-” 

“Bring a shovel.” 

I hang up and step on it. 

…

Because the dramatics never seem to end, it starts to rain. The droplets bounce gracefully off Chris’ tombstone. James had enough sense to bring a flashlight and hit it repeatedly against his hand before it illuminated the space in front of us.  

They both stand behind me, and I’m gripping the shovel with a shaking hand. The tombstone shines, and when I read the words written on it, it all finally starts to feel real. 

CHRISTOPHER R. HAGUE 

“Wait,” Lee whispers, grabbing the flashlight and leaning in closer, “They changed the date.”

“What?” I say, it was harder to make out the small text in the rain. 

JUNE 2nd, 1967 - SEPTEMBER 1ST, 1988

September 1st, 1988. The day I left for college. 

I blink hard, and when I open my eyes, I’m three feet away and vomiting violently into the wet, cold grass. Lee is holding my back with wide eyes, and at some point, James takes the shovel and starts to frantically dig. 

My head is pounding, and my chest is tightening. Questions swirl in my head, and it almost makes the world blur around me. 

Where had Chris been, really?

Had he been kept somewhere all this time, right under my nose?

I lay in the grass, clutching my chest. I couldn’t bring myself to stand, much less dig. Lee and James seem to know that, because they split the job between the two of them. 

I don’t know how many hours pass, I just watch the dirt pile get bigger and bigger, the muffled sound of Lee and James’ heavy breathing filling my ears until a big *thunk* breaks through the fog. 

My legs jump at the sound, and suddenly I’m standing, peering over the hole to see the glistening cherry wood casket. 

Lee, coated in mud, is standing on the bottom half of it. 

“What do we do if he’s in there?” He asks, looking up at me. I notice the tears in his eyes and how they almost blend in with the rain. 

“I don’t know,” I croak, and I hear James sniffle behind me, his hold on the flashlight growing unsteady. 

“What do we do if he’s not?” Lee asks again.

“I don’t know,” I admit. 

Lee leans the shovel against the grave’s wall of dirt and leans down. I can hear the clasp of the lock open, and Lee lifts it a little before loosening his hold. 

“God, I can’t.” His voice is thick with tears now, and he turns to James, who drops to his knees and pulls Lee out by his arm. 

Lee drops next to me on the grass, and James goes down into the grave himself. 

“Hold him back, Lee,” James calls out as he clasps the handle. I feel Lee grab me from under my arms, and he drags me away from the hole. He wraps his arms across my chest from behind and keeps me there. His hold is much gentler than when he and James dragged me down the pew, but I couldn’t fight it, even if I wanted to.

I wonder for a moment how I’ll know when James looks into the casket, but the loud creek and the choked gasp turn out to be all I need. 

The light from the flashlight illuminates the pit, and over the sound of rain, I can hear James’ voice. 

“He’s here.” 

I feel Lee’s chest shudder behind me.

I don’t know why I ask, but I do. Maybe because I don’t quite believe him yet. 

“What is he wearing?” I croak, Lee clutches me tighter, waiting for the answer. 

“He-” James’ voice breaks, “he’s wearing his green sweater.” 

There’s a part of me, somewhere deep, that releases. The part of me that held out hope.

Hope that this was all just a wildly fucked up dream, or I’d wake up in Green Meadows Hospital come sunrise, and a nurse would reassure me that this was all just one massive hallucination.   

Hope that the letter was just a fake and Chris would come back for me, somehow.

Hope that, despite everything, it would all be okay.

I thought it would hurt more, the hope being ripped from me, but all it did was deepen the pit in my stomach that was already there.

I slump against Lee’s chest. 

I feel myself give up then, and all the hope, the anger, the sadness...it all just fizzles. 

Turns out the pit is a sinkhole, and I feel nothing.

*I love you, man.*

*Wherever you are, I’ll always be right next to you. Live life for both of us, alright? Try your hand at becoming a photographer; you always took such wonderful pictures.* 

*Chris.* 

…

I went back to my apartment after a couple of days of sleeping on Lee’s bedroom floor. I could’ve stayed longer, I think, if I really wanted. But being in Black Rock was suffocating, and I could only really breathe when I was speeding down the highway with all the windows down. 

Lee, James, and I still call, but less frequently now. I think the hopelessness of it all has finally swept over us. Lee was right, it turns out, it was bigger than us, bigger than Chris, and- it turns out, bigger than just my father. 

Because in the four months since my father died and we found Chris’ body, three girls from Black Rock had gone missing. Lorretta, Elizabeth, and Trudy. 

All girls from the graduating class two years below mine, all strikingly beautiful, just like Layla was. 

There was outside interest, for a little while, news journalists from the bigger cities writing a story about the girls of Black Rock County- but it wasn’t long before they stopped accepting tips. 

I’d visited enough dingy phone booths and spoken to enough apprehensive journalists to know. 

But, I think in all my haste of spreading the word, I got a little too sloppy. Because one night, after I got off the phone with James, I found an envelope wedged under my door. *To Matthew Hague,* it says, in neat, loopy cursive. 

I swing my door open and peer into the hallway. When I’m sure there’s no one there, I close the door and lock it with shaking hands. I glance at the ottoman in my living room and make my way towards it, pushing it across the wooden floor and shoving it up against the apartment door. 

I sit on it with a huff and rip the envelope open. 

A picture falls out and lands face down on the floor. I pick it up, and it shakes in my hands. But it’s when I turn it over that all the air in the room seems to vanish. Because there, in the centre of the image- with tears in his wide brown eyes and olive skin pale with fear, is Lee. 

I tear my eyes off the photo and read the note.

In the past he was an addict and abusive. Now, he’s neither of those things but still has bad habits like sleeping until 4am and waking up at 3pm. He doesn’t work, says he’s waiting for his cousins business to take off. He doesn’t show initiative in planning dates or outings. Getting him out of bed at a decent time is such a chore. He doesn’t have a bank account says he’ll probably never get one. He’s unreliable. Says he’ll do something and never does. He lives his life just talking about all the things he’s working on but nothing ever changes. He’s been at a sober home and became house manager for 3 years. I don’t see him making any moves towards moving out and getting his own place. I send him info for affordable housing, offer to fix his resume but he just says ok never does anything. Sometimes when I bring up goals or what he wants from the relationship he says I stress him out and he gets annoyed. Every time we hang out we have to get a hotel or hang out in the car. I refuse to ask him to move into my house I would basically be paying for everything and do not believe he would help. Although im proud of him for getting sober and I love him for being sweet, generous, funny, and caring, but these lackadaisical habits just don’t align with me and what I want in a partner and he’s just not at my pace of growth.

I’m applying to grad school, have a 9-5. Co-own my home and I am financially responsible. I take care of my mom and my own home issues (maintenance and repairs, I can’t even count on him for that) I love being on time. I love planning things. I love waking up early and getting coffee. I love taking day trips, going on walks, window shopping, or just spending time together but he does not like anything. He just wants to lay in bed all day every day.

I voiced this to him before and he just keeps saying he’s working on it but he’s literally not. Nothing changes and if it does it’s one weekend of him waking up to take me to brunch or run an errand. Then back to his normal patterns. He says he’s depressed and has episodes of isolation but he doesn’t see a therapist or develop healthy coping strategies. I’ve sent him info on how to find a therapist and have suggested he go on walks, write, or something! So I’m pretty tired of it and told him we just don’t align anymore. I don’t want to make him feel bad so I’m not blaming or offending him or nothing like that but I am being clear that this isn’t want I want. Well, he’s almost guilting me saying that he’s “in the middle of making things happen” and if I “don’t want to be apart of it” then it’s my decision. He’s also calling me impatient and anxious, saying that what I want from him (waking up before noon, getting a job, planning more dates, following through with his word, being more productive) isn’t going to happen over night and he will be enough for someone else.

I know in my heart I shouldn’t have to “wait” for someone to get their shit together. Honestly, I feel like I’ve been more than lenient for more than long enough. Are a person’s lackadaisical habits a reason to end a relationship?",4,1766295681.0,relationship_advice,14,0.83,False

No return address. No note. Just a plain cardboard box with a jigsaw puzzle inside.

He brought it inside and dumped the pieces on his table.

A thousand pieces, maybe more.

He started working on it that evening. The edges first. Then the corners.

Slowly, an image emerged.

A living room.

His living room.

He paused. Stared at the pieces. The couch. The TV. The ceiling fan. Even the crack in the wall above the bookshelf.

All of it matched.

He kept going.

He worked on it after work. An hour here. Two hours there. Whenever he had time.

Days passed. Piece by piece, the image grew clearer.

The coffee table. The rug. The window with the blinds half-drawn.

Everything exact.

Then he noticed it.

In the corner, near the bookshelf. A dark shape. Blurred at first, but as he added more pieces, it sharpened.

A shadow.

Tall. Standing perfectly still.

He looked up at that corner of his living room.

Nothing there.

He went back to the puzzle.

He told himself it was just part of the design. Maybe an artistic choice. A flaw in the image.

But it bothered him.

The next evening, he worked on it again. Added more pieces. The table. The chair. The lamp.

He stopped.

The shadow had moved.

It wasn't in the corner anymore.

It was closer. Standing near the bookshelf now.

He stared at it.

That wasn't right. He remembered placing those pieces. The shadow had been farther back.

He shook his head. Kept working.

Two days later, he sat down after work. Added more pieces.

The shadow had moved again.

Now it was standing in the middle of the room. Closer to the table.

Closer to where he sat.

He looked around his living room.

Empty.

He went back to the puzzle.

Each time he worked on it, the shadow was closer.

Always closer.

He froze.

Looked around his living room.

Empty.

He looked back at the puzzle.

The shadow was standing directly behind the table now.

Where he was.

He looked over his shoulder.

Nothing.

Only two pieces left.

He picked up the second-to-last piece. Placed it.

The puzzle was almost complete.

His living room. Perfect. Exact.

And the shadow. Right behind where he sat.

He picked up the final piece.

His hand hovered over the gap.

He placed it.

The puzzle was complete. His living room. The shadow right behind where he sat.

A voice whispered in his ear.

""You're the puzzle.""

.............………………………………………………..

Two detectives stood in the living room.

""When did the neighbor notice the smell?"" one asked.

""Three days ago. Called it in this morning.""

The detective looked around the room.

Blood everywhere. Pieces of flesh and bone scattered across the floor.

""How many?""

The other detective checked his notebook.

He tells me he’s from Ohio. I ask him, “how long you been here in the Philippines?”. He says just 6 months but that he’s loving it. Oh, I could see in his face that he’s as happy as a bug in a rug. He then starts talking about how great the people in the mountains are etc, etc. He tells me he’s got a Filipina girlfriend and they are engaged. He shows me a pic of her and asks me what I think. I said she looks young and he tells me she’s 19. He then told me she’d been getting harassing text messages from Indian and Arab men and that he even had to personally confront one of them on his girlfriend’s phone. 

What came next shocked me because it came out of NOWHERE! 

Right before he got up to leave he said, “And oh, I’ve been teaching my girlfriend about the N words too” (yall know what I mean when I say “n word”). Now actually I’ve heard this word a lot from expats, especially the older ones, but what shocked me the most is the way he said it. He said it in a Mr. Roger’s friendly tone kind of way. I was FLABBERGASTED! Then he just casually walked away. 

Folks, this is REAL LIFE. Maybe next time I’ll post a pic laying on the beach staring out on the horizon for those who can’t handle REALITY. ",4,1766295483.0,Philippines_Expats,15,0.63,False
1prywgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Han47fiction/comments/1prywgu/my_poor_baby/,My Poor Baby,"He noticed it three weeks ago.  
The coffee tasted wrong. Metallic. Bitter.

At first, he thought the machine needed cleaning. Then he thought maybe the beans had gone bad.  
But it kept happening.  
Every morning. Same taste.

He started pretending to drink it. Raising the mug to his lips, swallowing nothing, spitting it into the sink when no one was around.

And he started noticing other things.

His wife. Waking up at 2 AM. Every night. Like clockwork.  
She’d slip out of bed. Quiet. Careful.  
He would lie there, pretending to sleep, listening to her footsteps fade down the hall.

Then there was his mother.

She’d been living with them for six months. Alzheimer’s, getting worse.  
Most days she didn’t recognize him at all.  
She’d shuffle around the house like a ghost.

One morning, he sat with her in the living room.  
“Mom,” he asked softly, “how are you feeling?”

She looked at him, eyes distant.  
“My baby. My poor baby.”

“What is it, Mom?”

Her hand shot out and grabbed his, desperate.  
“My baby… my poor baby… kill… son…” she whispered.

He froze.  
“Kill… me? Who?”

She stared past him, toward the kitchen, where his wife was making breakfast.

“My baby… my poor baby… kill… son…” she murmured again.

Then she wandered off, shuffling down the hallway.

He sat there, heart pounding.  
The coffee. The late‑night disappearances.  
It all made sense.

He had to act first.

He planned carefully. Methodically.  
The backyard, near the shed, he dug the hole at night.  
He’d cover it with a tarp and leaves. No one would find her.

He told himself it was to protect the kids. To protect himself.  
He told himself he didn’t have a choice.

Two nights later, around 2 AM, he woke to the sound of his wife slipping out of bed again.  
He followed her, gripping his shovel.

She didn’t go to the kitchen.  
She went to the front door.  
Slipped outside.

He watched through the window.

A car was parked down the street, headlights off.  
She walked to it, opened the passenger door.  
A man was inside.  
She leaned in. Kissed him.

He stood there, frozen.  
His stomach twisted. His knees went weak.

Then he heard it.  
Shuffling footsteps.  
A rattling noise in the kitchen.

He turned.

His mother was in the kitchen, moving slowly, carefully.  
She opened the cabinet under the sink.  
Pulled out a bottle.

Drano.

He froze.

She unscrewed the cap and poured it into his coffee mug. The one he used every morning. Stirring slowly, murmuring under her breath:

“My baby… my poor baby… kill… son…”

In the dead silence, her words grew clearer:

“My baby… my poor baby… kill man who says he’s my son.”

She put the bottle back, rinsed the spoon, and shuffled past him without noticing he was there.

He stood in the dark.

The hole in the backyard was still open.  
He realized he’d dug it for the wrong person.

1pryuxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1pryuxi/i_still_love_her_2_years_later_and_my_situation/,"I still love her 2 years later, and my situation is interesting...","Me (20M) and her (19) separated 2 years ago. It feels so wrong to feel this way about her so long afterwards.

Here's the interesting bit. I've been #1 best friends with her sister ...so it's weird.

I was in a theatre group when I met her. We started talking and quickly became a lot more than just friends. We went on dates, celebrated  birthdays, loved on each other, confided in each other about philosophy and spirituality, our fears, our desires. It's the first time I ever had something like that. She ended it because of things happening in her life. HOWEVER, she wanted me to take her to prom since it was something she had discussed before ending things...and of course I did. It was an amazing prom, we both looked amazing and we both looked happy. I took her to our favorite places. After prom, we went out for food many times. Sometimes I wonder if that was a good idea, but it certainly made me and her happy. Doesn't that make it all worth it?

I became friends with her sister a few months after the breakup. Her sister is the lead of our theatre group, and with my lead role it was only natural for us to begin talking more. She knew of our relationship (they had to witness us having a private moment), but we never talked of it. Not only was it a sensitive topic at the time, but I wanted to be friends with THEM, not the idea of their sister. After years of being friends and sharing a lot of beautiful moments together, we've become inseparable. 

So with all of that being said, safe to say I am very familiar face to both of them. Me and my ex hang out often and have lots of moments together, it's been this way for a while. We go to shows, get coffee, and sit around at home watching movies. Me and her sister hang out almost everyday doing anything we want.

Today, we were all at the house laughing and talking. All of sudden, they start talking about the date that my ex is going on. I have heard about their previous relationships after ours, and I never paid it any mind. She is her own person and I'm happy that she can explore different things with others. 

Though, I still feel so hurt and to be earnestly blunt, jealous....my best friend KNOWS that I still have feelings for her sister. My ex also knows my love for her, she knows it's deeper than most but to what extent, I'm not sure. It made me uncomfortable, so opted to stay quiet. Maybe this was the best choice? 

I just don't understand why I still love her? Why couldn't or can't we work? What's wrong with me, am I not doing enough, saying enough? It seems like she loves me...but not. Talking about this confliction with my best friend just feels...weird, for obvious reasons.

I sent it, asked her to get coffee and go on a walk at one of the places we both frequent (both runners who hit the same trails) and she replied back really quickly saying we could maybe figure something out. 

Obviously a maybe isn’t a for sure yes, but it also wasn’t a no, and she followed up with asking where I lived. I replied, asked her the same, and we’re only 20 mins apart. My next text verbatim “oh cool! Are you from ____/the area originally” since we’ve never spoken before, so for all I could know, she could be from a totally different place and bring in a whole new topic to a convo if she was from somewhere else. 

She didn’t open it for a couple of days, so my friend said to just dm and say that I don’t like DM’s bc I don’t check them, here’s my number, would love to grab coffee and go somewhere. (Insert #) that text sat for 10 days and I eventually just said screw it, idk what I said wrong, move on I guess. She finally opened it today but didn’t reply, so now I’m wondering if she just said yes in the moment and then was like nvm, or if she’s just busy 24/7 and literally didn’t check DM’s for almost 2 weeks, or what. 

To be fair, I didn’t meet her or spend any money on a date, so I’m not even really mad about it, but it does make me question where something could’ve possibly gone wrong. 

Ladies on here, help me out. What would cause 10 days of not opening a text and then just leaving it when they finally do?

We’re hoping for:
	•	Good ski schools / beginner slopes
	•	A walkable or cozy village/town
	•	Good food, coffee, and après-ski vibes (nothing too wild, just lively and warm)

**Letters of Recommendation**
Ap lit teacher — 10/10, had her for two years + she runs students 4 social justice. I eat w her all the time and we give each other book recs constantly. Wrote like 2 pages calling me her fav student and the best writer she’s seen in 20 years 😛

Calc bc/calc 3 teacher — ?/10, didn’t see her letter. Had her for the last two years w really small classes though, so she knows me pretty well. Great teacher 

counslor — prob not great/10. Only started liking me once I got national merit lmao

**Interviews**

Did the video profile. Used my amazing sweater collection to talk about my art, comic collection, love of exercise/the outdoors, and fav books. Thought it was pretty funny and showed my personality well. Forced my little brother to do a skit where he was Batman and I was the riddler lol

I also submitted an art portfolio w some of my favorite pieces and a short artist’s statement. I have some pieces I’m pretty proud of and thought the effort I put in to my skills wasn’t really reflected in my app. 

**Essays**

**personal statement** \-- talked about growing into my activism. I can’t even say how good it was cause I’m so sick of thinking abt it 🥀🥀🥀 

**uchicago extended** \-- used old prompt (apples vs oranges). Compared them as symbols through art and literature. Thought it was kinda dry so like 3 days before submission I threw in as many puns as I could possibly think of (get to the core of the issue, in-zest-igate further, an a-peel-ing prospect, living apple-y ever after, etc). Ended up being pretty proud of it

**why us** \-- i liked this one a lot! Talked about my love of “unanswerable questions” and how I could explore them in different classes/clubs 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UChicago yayyayyayya
* couple of state schools

*Waitlists:*

* nope 

*Rejections:*

* nope

  
**MY INSIGHTS** 

So glad I don’t have to spend winter break applying to more schools 🙏🙏🙏🙏. I lowk gave up this semester and got a couple of Bs so glad this worked out lol

I can’t really say what parts of my app got me in, but I think what helped a lot was authenticity! Don’t be afraid to be nerdy/geeky/vulnerable. It’s hard for AOs to see if you’d be a good fit if you don’t share anything abt yourself. I joked around a lot in my essays but I think I balanced it pretty well with reflection and personal growth. Good luck to everyone still applying !!

My husband Charles didn’t even glance at me, yanking his shoelaces tight. “Vivian’s moving. She needs help.” 

Vivian. His EX–WIFE.

I’ll be back in three days.” 

Charles Miller!” 

The door slammed shut. 

My mother–in–law walked in with a mug of lactation tea. “You know, Vivian’s all alone now. You have me, you have the baby. top being so selfish.” 

My hands clenched the sheets.

So I and our newborn come second to his ex–wife’s moving day?**”**

Chapter 1 

Last night, the baby cried four times. I nursed four times. Charles slept through it all in the guest room–said he needed rest 

for work. 

This morning, he got dressed like he was going to a business meeting. Said he was taking time off. 

For a second, I thought he’d finally remembered–oh right, I have a wife who just had surgery and a newborn. 

Jope. He was helping his EX–WIFE move. 

Vivian. I’d been hearing that name for three years. 

Before we got married, Charles said they “ended things amicably.” No drama. 

fter we got married? Turns out “no drama” actually meant \*\*he’s still in love with her. 

Vivian’s car broke down? Charles fixed it. 

Vivian’s laptop crashed? Charles drove over. 

Vivian’s lightbulb went out? Charles changed it. 

Every time I said I wasn’t feeling well, he’d say: “She’s a woman living alone. She has no one.” 

‘d say: “I’m a woman too.”

scrolled down. A month ago, he’d posted: 

Weekend vibes 

‘hoto: two coffee cups. One black coffee. One latte. 

We both drank lattes. The black coffee was for Vivian. 

That day, I was home on bed rest. He said he was **“**working late.” 

Guess he just didn’t want to be around his pregnant whale of a wife. 

I put the phone down. Stared at the ceiling.

***Valerius Thorne, First Imperial Archivist***

**CLASSIFIED TRANSCRIPT \[CODE: WHITE/ECHO\]**

**Source:** *The White House - Situation Room (Washington D.C.)* **Date:** *April 20, 204X* **Event:** *United Nations General Assembly - Extraordinary Session*

**\[Scene Description\]** The room is small, windowless, and smells of stale coffee and high-grade electronics. The air is recycled and kept at a shivering 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Dominating the North Wall is the ""Big Board""—a massive, encrypted display currently split into two feeds.

* **Feed A (Left):** A high-definition, live feed of the UN General Assembly Hall in New York. The hall is packed. Every seat is filled. The murmur of two thousand diplomats creates a low, oceanic roar.
* **Feed B (Right):** A mosaic of global news tickers, all silent, all screaming in red and yellow fonts: *REID ARRIVES - NYC LOCKDOWN - MARKETS HALTED - THE SURRENDER?*

**\[The Players\]** Seated around the mahogany conference table are the architects of American power:

* **President Thomas J. Whitmore (POTUS):** Sleeves rolled up, tie loosened. He looks like a man who hasn't slept in three days. He is staring at Feed A.
* **Vice President Hayes:** Taking furious notes on a legal pad.
* **General Mitchell Vance (Chairman, Joint Chiefs):** In full dress uniform, his face a mask of stone. He is the brother of the Senator who threatened Reid, and he looks ready to finish the argument with a carrier strike group.
* **Director Cohen (CIA):** Slumped in his chair, tapping a stylus against his teeth.
* **Director Miller (FBI):** whispering into a secure phone.
* **Ron Klain (Chief of Staff):** Pacing behind the President.
* **Admiral Blackwood**: CNO

And in the corner, seated on a folding chair against the wall, is **Captain James Miller (USN)**, Aide-de-Camp to Admiral Blackwood. He has a laptop on his knees. He is invisible to the men at the table. He is watching.

**\[Transcript Starts - 09:55 AM EST\]**

**Chief of Staff Klain:** ""Five minutes. He's in the building. Secret Service confirms he passed the magnetometer. No weapons. Just a datapad.""

**POTUS:** ""Is the perimeter secure?""

**Director Miller (FBI):** ""We have snipers on every roof from 42nd Street to the East River. NYPD has the blocks locked down. But Mr. President... the crowds. There are two million people out there. They aren't protesting against him anymore. They're cheering. They're chanting his name.""

**POTUS:** ""They're cheering for a terrorist?""

**Director Cohen (CIA):** ""They're cheering for access to space, sir. The narrative shifted. Our psyops campaign failed. The moment he released that 'Surrender' letter, he became a martyr. If we arrest him today, we create a saint. If we kill him... we create a god.""

**General Vance:** ""He's not a god. He's a man. And he's walking into a trap. We have the warrant ready. The moment he steps off that podium, U.S. Marshals take him into custody. Material Witness. Terrorist Act. We hold him at Gitmo until he gives up the encryption keys to the Tether.""

**VP Hayes:** ""And the Chinese? Liu endorsed the embargo, but his fleet is still parked in the Malacca Strait.""

**Director Cohen:** ""Liu is hedging. If Reid falls today, China joins the sucess. If Reid wins... well, Liu will say he was 'protecting stability'. The Chinese play the long game. We are playing poker.""

**POTUS:** ""Quiet. He's entering the hall.""

\[On Screen A, the murmur in the UN Assembly dies instantly. The doors at the back open. Georges Reid enters. He is not wearing the grey flight suit of SLAM. He is wearing a simple, dark suit. He walks down the aisle alone. No bodyguards. No entourage. He looks small against the cavernous architecture of the hall. He walks to the podium, places his datapad on the lectern, and looks up at the gathered representatives of Earth.\]

**General Vance:** ""Look at him. Arrogant son of a bitch. He thinks he owns the room.""

**POTUS:** ""Turn up the audio. I want to hear his confession.""

**\[The audio from the UN feed fills the Situation Room. Reid taps the microphone. It booms.\]**

**Reid (On Screen):** ""Mr. Secretary-General. Distinguished Delegates. I was summoned to answer for my crimes. Here I am.""

**Reid:** ""I wanted to read you my letter of surrender, but strangely enough I received another one, from a totally unexpected source: **Aditya Rao** — **Hyderabad**, **Telangana, India**. A high school student.""

\[A ripple of confusion moves through the General Assembly. The delegates exchange glances. Is this a joke? Is he stalling?\]

**Reid:** (Smiling slightly, looking down at his datapad) ""He writes: 'Dear Mr Reid, despite all the admiration I have for you, your space elevator is a hoax.""

\[In the Situation Room, Director Cohen snorts.\]

**Director Cohen:** ""He's reading fan mail? Is he insane?""

**Reid:** ""You see we were totally transparent with you: a 100 tons container sent every minute to geosync orbit. And obviously one down on the descending line. Not a whisper, not a single paper, not even a classified report on what is honestly a total impossibility.""

\[The confusion in the hall deepens. The murmurs grow louder. The Chinese Ambassador is leaning forward, his translation earpiece pressed to his ear. The American Ambassador looks like he is about to shout an objection.\]

\[Suddenly, movement in the third row. A man stands up. It is Dr. Kweku Mensah, the representative from Ghana, a Nobel Laureate in Physics. He is shaking. His face is drained of blood.\]

**Dr. Mensah:** (Shouting without a microphone, his voice cracking with terror) ""YOU DID NOT DARE!""

\[The hall freezes. Mensah points a trembling finger at Reid.\]

**Reid:** ""Please, Professor Mensah. Give me five minutes.""

\[Reid turns back to the assembly. His smile is gone. He looks tired, almost apologetic.\]

**Reid:** ""You see, my friends, to fulfill our promise of fast logistics, we needed energy. A lot of energy. To lift a 100-ton container to Geostationary Orbit against Earth's gravity at that acceleration in one hour requires approximately 20 Gigawatts of power. Continuous. Per container.""

**\[He taps the lectern.\]**

**Reid:** ""We have one hundred and twenty containers moving up and down the line at any given second. Plus the station keeping. Yes, my friends. Simple high school physics.""

\[The murmuring in the hall explodes into a roar. Diplomats are frantically typing on their tablets, calling their science advisors. On the screen in the Situation Room, the chaos is palpable.\]

**Reid:** (Waiting, the smile returning, colder now) ""Do the math.""

\[In the Situation Room, the silence is heavy. Admiral Blackwood spins his chair around, his face pale.\]

**Admiral Blackwood:** ""Captain Miller. You're the MIT graduate. Run the numbers. Is he bluffing?""

\[Captain Miller is already typing. His fingers blur on the keyboard. He hits enter. He stares at the result.\]

**Captain Miller:** ""Sir... he's right. It's a conservative estimate. To operate the elevator at the advertised capacity... he needs 2.5 Terawatts.""

**General Vance:** ""2.5 Terawatts? That's impossible. That's... that's 15% of the total power consumption of the human species.""

\[In a large technical room in the basement of the UN building, a light suddenly flickers in the dark—red, then orange, then green. It emanates from the new “Air Handling Unit” delivered just the previous week, following the catastrophic failure of the original system. Through an invisible conduit, a deluge of energy surges upward, coursing through the building's infrastructure, infiltrating the fibers of the brand-new carpet in the General Assembly Hall, and culminating in a hidden loop directly beneath the speaker's podium.\]

Reid smiles slowly. He feels the enormous magnetic field surging through the loop, resonating within the new metal lattice of his bones. It is a hum only he can hear, a vibration of pure power.

He taps on the microphone again, not like a defendant, but like a teacher calling an unruly classroom to order. ""Please, please, look here.""

The room quiets slowly, sensing the shift in the air.

""I want to introduce you to the future,"" Reid says softly.

Suddenly, the air behind him shimmers. An enormous hologram materializes, filling the cavernous space above the podium. It is a grainy, charmingly imperfect video.

It shows a school exhibition. A small girl with messy hair is talking to a woman wearing a Kestrel logo badge. Behind them stands a nondescript green metal box, roughly the size of a standard shipping container. The girl is pointing at a golden symbol on the casing.

Reid gestures to the frozen image. And suddenly to the astonishment of the audience, he rises in the air, at the level of the green container.

""This,"" he says, his voice echoing in the silence, ""is a Helios Node. It is a self-sustaining fusion reactor. It produces a lot of Terawatts of clean, carbon-free energy. Indefinitely.""

\[The assembly gasps. In the Situation Room, General Vance drops his pen.\]

**Reid:** ""We installed this one in a science museum in Luxembourg six months ago. We disguised it as a science exhibit. It has been powering the entire Benelux grid since January. And nobody noticed.""

\[Reid hovers effortlessly, looking down at the delegates. The tension in the room is breaking, replaced by a strange, collective curiosity. Shoulders relax. People lean back in their chairs. The impending doom of the embargo and the trial feels distant now. This isn't a tribunal anymore; it's a show. A magic show. And for the first time in months, the audience is actually enjoying it.\]

**Reid:** ""And now it is...""

\[Reid raises his hand to snap his fingers for dramatic effect. He presses his thumb against his middle finger. His fingers slide silently. He fails. A few people in the audience chuckle. He tries again, frowning slightly. Another silent slide. He finally succeeds on the third try—a sharp, clear snap—and the whole room erupts in applause, delighted by the humanizing error.\]

In the Situation Room, President Whitmore stares at the screen, his face draining of color as he watches the world's diplomats clapping for the man he intended to arrest.

**POTUS:** ""It’s turning into a circus. Why was I not forewarned? You bloody incompetents.""

On the giant screen a map of Europe appears with the major electricity main lines. Benelux is green, the rest red. And then the green advances, covering the Ruhr, the industrial region of Germany, northern France, going down on the east to Switzerland, and then stopping.

**Reid**, apologetic: For the rest of Europe, we shall need some coordination with EDF, the french nuclear energy supplier.

Then Reid turns toward the Chinese ambassador. The screen is now showing Asia. A green point, Singapore, and suddenly green lines shooting toward all neighbourhood countries. In the sea, a single green line starts from Singapore, cross the south china sea, and ends up in Shanghai, and suddenly the region of Shanghai and Shenzhen turn green.

“Your excellency, the quantum communication experimental line, that you agreed to connect too, can be used for other, more mundane applications.”

The screen centers now to Mali, where suddenly a big green dot starts blinking.

“If our African friends agree, we can link you to that generator in a matter of weeks or months.”

“For India? Give us the ‘green’ light (laughters in the room)”.

Reid rises a little more in the air.

“You have, the where, everywhere, the when, now, what is left is how much.”

“It will be free, decarbonated, unlimited energy for all! We now have a real chance against global warning, and even more importantly, poverty.”

“Who will vote for the independence of space, the independence of energy, the independence for all?”

**“SLAM, for mankind on Earth. And Beyond”**

[Logo](https://i.ibb.co/MyYTbnKq/SLAM-LOGO.png)

The silence in the Situation Room was heavy, broken only by the low, steady hum of high-end electronics.

On the main wall, Feed A broadcasted live from the UN Hall. The image was chaotic, jubilant. Delegates had abandoned protocol and were standing on their chairs. They weren’t just clapping; they were reaching out towards Reid, who remained suspended ten inches above the floor, moving slowly through the crowd. He smiled benevolently, looking less like a CEO and more like a prophet who had just parted the sea.

Beside him, the vote count on the massive display ticked up rapidly, freezing on the final tally for **Resolution 2443: Recognition of S.L.A.M. Sovereignty & Energy Partnership**.

* **YES:** 189
* **NO:** 1 (United States)
* **ABSTAIN:** 3 (Israel, UK, Poland)

To the right, on Feed B, the mood was apocalyptic. The mosaic of news tickers had transformed into a cascading red waterfall of panic.

* **CNBC:** ENERGY SECTOR BLOODBATH. EXXON, SHELL, ARAMCO TRADING HALTED AFTER 90% DROP.
* **AL JAZEERA:** REVOLUTION IN THE GULF. MIGRANT WORKERS SEIZE OIL FIELDS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR. 'WE ARE FREE'.
* **BBC:** LONDON RIOTS. CITIZENS DEMAND 'THE REID LINK'. GOVERNMENT UNDER SIEGE.
* **REUTERS:** CHINA ANNOUNCES 'STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP' WITH SLAM. US NAVY ORDERED OUT OF MALACCA STRAIT.

President Whitmore stared at the two screens. The cheering on the left. The burning world on the right. He felt the gravity of the moment crushing him, and he slowly sank into his leather chair.

""Turn it off,"" he said, his voice barely rising above the hum of the servers.

General Vance turned, his brow furrowed. ""Sir?""

""Turn it all off.""

Screen A went black. Screen B followed an instant later. The room plunged into sudden darkness, illuminated only by the ghostly green glow of the emergency exit sign.

The darkness seemed to suck the oxygen out of the room. For a long moment, no one breathed.

""Execute the contingencies,"" Whitmore said. His voice was no longer a whisper; it was cold iron.

General Vance hesitated in the gloom. ""Sir?""

""The Elevator,"" Whitmore clarified, standing up and smoothing his suit jacket. ""We prepared for this scenario. Initiate the seizure protocol. Combined sea, air, and commando teams. We aren't destroying the base station, General. We're taking it.""

""Mr. President,"" Vance cautioned, the light from his tablet illuminating his sweat-slicked face. ""That is an act of war against a sovereign entity recognized by 189 nations. The fallout—""

""Is preferable to the alternative,"" Whitmore cut him off. ""They want to play gods? Fine. But they'll pay rent to the United States. Secure the asset. Do it.""

Whitmore didn't wait for an acknowledgment. He strode toward the exit, the Secret Service detail swarming around him like moths. Vance cast one last look at the blank screens, then tapped his headset and followed, barking confirmation codes into his mic.

The heavy door hissed shut, sealing the room.

The silence returned, heavier than before.

Miller remained leaning against the tactical table, his arms crossed, his face unreadable in the shadows. Across the room, Admiral Halloway stood rigid, staring at the empty space where the President had been.

""He actually did it,"" Blackwood whispered, the words sounding too loud in the empty room. He turned to Miller. ""What is your take?""

Miller finally looked up, his eyes catching the green light. ""When it smells like a trap and looks like a trap...""

""A trap?"" Blackwood asked. ""What can we do?""

""Reid has never killed anybody,"" Miller replied, his voice low but steady. ""Even those mobsters. He doesn't want to kill. We do. So let us spring the trap, Sir.""

Blackwood smiled, a cold expression in the dim light, as he turned to leave the room. ""Let's take a spider in his lair.""

Miller stood finally alone in the room, looking at the dark screens.

""Long live the Empire,"" he whispered into the silence. ""Long live the Emperor.""

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

This is kinda a rant and also cause im feeling a bit lost on what to do. 
Idk what to do anymore. 

I never had issues like this till this one partner I had and my lack of education, I was dealing with Ureaplasma before all of this. And UTIs so I’ve being dealing with a lot of symptoms and they kind of overlap. Also done antibiotics like doxycycline because of Ureaplasma. 


Fast forward, Ureaplasma parvum is “gone” but E. coli has remained and now e facelis. 
I’m currently taking hiprex and phenazopyridine. 


August I had cleared E. coli back to back. First,  had ecoli and proteus miribalis- treated with levofloxican. 

But then E. coli remained and was treated with macrobid. 
I kept getting symptoms, mainly urinary symptoms. They slowly got worst, so I kept testing multiple times at different doctors and always had inconclusive results on my urine. Like “mixed flora” “ less than 10K CFU” etc…. I believe this is because of the labs thresholds. My bacteria doesn’t reach 100k CFU for a “true infection”. 

Finally went to my gyn and PCP SAME DAY for a urine culture again and it showed E. coli, with e facelis at the gyn test results but pcp was only e facelis showed up…. 
As you can see E. coli plays peek a boo and it honestly drives me crazy. Cause we’re did it go if I haven’t treated it and have symptoms. 
They both gave me macrobid. Which I haven’t taken any because I don’t think it’ll work… I’ll explain further 

My shocker was when i opened my results and seen, THE SAME exact resistant/sensitive patterns as August’s ecoli strain….? even thought I clicked the wrong test but no! 

So I went to a urogyn and finally confirmed my theory. She did a “vaginal aerobic swab”and showed the same E. coli strain as August. It never left. My vagina was a reservoir for this strain of esbl E. coli. So macrobid worked for my bladder but my vagina wasn’t touched. 

I’m not prone to UTIs. All this mess started with Ureaplasma and this persistent E. coli.

Now where I’m lost…. 

The E. coli 25-50k CFU,  I have is only sensitive to IV antibiotics. 

When you compare the results. My vaginal swab only shows sensitivity to IV antibiotics like meropenem. All penem antibiotics, I can do. 
My urine tests shows the same but only oral antibiotics is macrobid. 
All the doctors, including the ER, that I’ve going to tell me to take macrobid and hiprex to avoid the infection despite the bacteria still growing. 

But what about my vagina? I feel that it’s the initial problem that going to keep having me back at square one. 

I thought getting meropenem would be the solution and finally got my urogyn to write me a script, but chapgpt says that it doesn’t penetrate vaginal tissues, and it only works on active infection, not “ colonization”

So am I just suppose to let it grow for the infection to flare? I’m scared of sepsis….. 

Urinalysis shows everything clear but I’m having symptoms 

My good bacteria is low asf. I know I have AV. Aerobic vaginitis 
My vagina hurts and it’s dry, my clitoris hurts so much i sometimes limp as i walk. I have back pain and side pain that comes and goes. I feel so disgusting :( and frustrated, I feel tired like I’m running out of strength sometimes. I’m upset, I can’t have sex because I mentally think I’m making everything worst. This has taken a toll on me so heavily. I feel that I need to throw a tantrum on the floor so doctors would take me serious, I don’t see the preventative health care no where. Literally had a doctor tell me I just want the easy way out and I’m just upset because it’s easier than putting in the work……

Idk what else I’m NOT doing. 
Lactic acid suppository has helped, probiotic yogurt, boric acid, no sugars, no underwear at night, cotton underwear only, I’m not even having sex…. No crazy soaps down there, no caffeine ( my bladder hurts and I don’t even like coffee or soda) I change underwear throughout the day so I don’t have the same panties all day….. all since August. I truly think E. coli and the pathogens just aren’t letting my vagina do her thing 

If I put my good bacteria up, it’s going to help with the symptoms, but I still have this pathogen inside of me that I would like to get rid of. Get rid of it means I need to go on antibiotic that will still wipe off my good bacteria even more. And I’m just so upset because every time I’m so close to the solution it’s a problem. 

I thought IV antibiotics will fix my problem, so I could at least get a clean floor, but now I see that it probably won’t penetrate my vagina….. according to ChatGPT, due to the mucosa , so do I just have to deal with it for life? ",0,1766293255.0,TwoXChromosomes,5,0.5,False

And I can feel myself getting worse at social stuff the longer I go without doing it. Conversations that used to flow naturally now feel forced and I run out of things to say faster, probably because I expect myself to say something good enough if that makes sense. Eye contact feels weirdly intense in a way it didn't before too. So basically it's like a muscle that atrophied from not being used.
I started trying to work on it lately. I’m forcing myself to for example ask two unnecessary questions when buying coffee or stuff like that and it definitely turns awkward almost every time for now but I feel like I’m doing something good for myself. The thing is I have limited options to do stuff like that in my daily life so I also started doing something that felt very very weird at first but at this point idc, practicing conversation on gleam because I needed somewhere low pressure to shake off the rust. Practicing conversation with an app feels kinda backwards tbh but as I said at this point its whatever and progress is slow but I think it's happening a little bit. My guess is that its the coffee shop style conversations that are doing most of that but the app is making having those conversations a little bit easier because I have this obsession with feeling like I prepared for a situation. And I think that’s more of a temporary tool or at least I hope so but as I said for now it has its use for me. I’m also trying to say yes to almost any invitation for anything but its already kinda exhausting so we’ll see.
I guess I'm posting because I'm wondering if anyone else is in this same weird limbo. Not necessarily depressed or anything clinical, just kind of slipped into isolation and now don't know how to climb back out. It's lonely but also loneliness has become comfortable in a way that makes changing feel hard. I realize that that’s a very basic topic on this subreddit but almost everyone is experiencing something more like suffering due to loneliness whereas I’m honestly not so much but still want to change. So I’m not sure what my point is, I guess seeing that there are some people that can relate to this specifically honestly",1,1766293088.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

These foods are perfectly OK to enjoy on special occasions like Christmas Day, but it’s when these foods start creeping into our lives well before Santa slides down the chimney and well into the new year that we can get ourselves into a bit of trouble.

To give you a helping hand and keep you on your [health and wellbeing journey](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/health/wellbeing/yoga-meditation-and-gratitude-journals-how-to-find-happiness-by-being-mindful/news-story/55e0ea13abddeb85554a0d8ab9ff1ef8), here’s Christmas lunch with nutritious spin on it. With these simple tips, you’ll be able to enjoy a happy and [healthy Christmas](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/health/what-this-ultraprocessedfood-guru-is-eating-at-christmas-will-surprise-you/news-story/d4d4c5ab31df1706b13158b42f6f5c89) and never feel like you’re missing out.

Want a Christmas lunch that still feels like Christmas, without the post-lunch slump? Nutritionist Jemma O’Hanlon shares her top tips for a happy, healthy festive spread: build a colourful grazing board, make easy ingredient swaps (think smoked salmon and nuts), load your main plate with vibrant salads and plant-based sides, and keep dessert “quality over quantity” with berries first.

# Appetisers

Those [delicious nibbles](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/food-drink/bring-in-the-new-year-with-these-showstopping-dinner-party-ideas/news-story/54f6d4a2767c2b4bdb9508377de2214d) that often tie us over can vary from offering very little to loads of nutritional value. Let’s take a grazing board for example. Instead of a charcuterie board loaded up with processed meats and creamy dips, why not upgrade your board to be a rainbow of seasonal fruits and vegetables, nuts, olives, wholegrain crackers and cheese. Think toasted almonds, marinated vegetables, seasonal stone fruit and fresh berries.

The brighter the board, the healthier it will be with all those naturally occurring antioxidants. It’ll also keep you fuller for longer and you’ll be less likely to overindulge in your main meal.

The best way to boost your Christmas lunch is to load up on plants – think of all those fresh salad, vegetable and legume dishes. I tend to be on salad duty in my household and one of my favourite salads I make every year is with mangoes, given they’re plentiful and in season.

Dietitian Jemma O'Hanlon is a firm believer in fresh ingredients. Picture: Brad Fleet

Choose whatever seasonal produce you love the most and have a search for some recipes – it can be as easy as combining a fruit (like mango) with some healthy fats (like avocado and walnuts), and tossing them through some mixed leaves, a tin of legumes (I love using lentils), and shaking up a basic dressing of extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and Dijon mustard.

Heartier salads with wholegrains like brown rice and quinoa are fantastic to keep your guests fuller for longer, and you can easily throw in a can of chickpeas, kidney beans or black beans for extra protein.

Speaking of protein, [fish and seafood win the race when it comes to heart-healthy animal proteins](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/health/diet/these-vibrant-greek-tuna-salad-jars-make-lunchtime-easy/news-story/3af8fef825b19daf6b2b1e3f3f861b19), and are best grilled or barbecued. Your fish market is your best friend, and whether it’s prawns, oysters, scallops, mussels or even lobster, seafood offers an abundance of nutrition, including omega-3s, zinc, iodine, selenium and vitamins A and D.

As for meat, there’s nothing wrong with having a little bit of meat like [chicken, turkey, baked ham or roast beef](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/weekend-australian-magazine/what-to-do-with-all-that-turkey-and-ham-elizabeth-hewson-has-some-answers/news-story/b4a903d35293e5932c7bc4dbb87ff51f). Just try to avoid the visible fat on meats, like the fat found on a baked ham – just trim those bits off.

Deep-fried seafood for grilled or barbecued seafood

Sausages for chicken skewers

Fatty meats for trimmed meats with no visible fat

Cream-based bakes for fresh, seasonal salads

# Desserts

I have a confession to make: I have a soft spot for plum pudding, and it absolutely, without question has to be served with brandy custard. Some of my fondest childhood memories are of gathering together with family. After Christmas lunch, Grandad would light the Christmas pudding with a splash of scotch, and we’d watch as the flames swept over the pudding. Then, once portioned out, we’d tuck into our slice, and to our delight, discover the hidden coins that Grandma had baked in the pudding for us, wrapped in a bit of baking paper.

Now, while baking with coins is probably not what we do in this day and age, this story is to remind us that food is more than nutrition, and it’s OK to have a slice of pudding on Christmas Day.

There are a couple of tips I often share with people when it comes to dessert. Firstly, load up loads of seasonal fruit and berries in your bowl first. Then, add in the dessert that lights you up and fills you with joy. Whether it’s Christmas pudding, trifle or pavlova, choose your favourite dessert and savour every mouthful. This is about quality over quantity. If you want to try all that’s on offer, keep your portions to a little sliver.

A simple way to get your sweets to last longer is to eat with a teaspoon, rather than a dessert spoon. Also, beware of eating around screens. Focus on the social aspect of eating with family and friends. If you eat in front of a screen, suddenly your dessert will be gone and you won’t even register that you’ve eaten it.

# Chocolates and treats

Most of us know that [dark chocolate is the healthier option](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/health/diet/dark-chocolates-sweet-secret-it-may-help-you-stay-young/news-story/c399bb63b3f263ba901b1ed9aa971cc9) when it comes to chocolate, as it is higher in flavonoids, a type of antioxidant that helps to protect our cells from free radical damage and has been associated with reduced blood pressure. If you have the choice between chocolates, the rule is the darker the better. White chocolate offers little to no benefits as it doesn’t have any cacao.

When it comes to this time of the day, I would take a moment to ask yourself, do I really need to eat this chocolate? If you’re feeling peckish and still hungry, go for it. But if you’re sitting there, feeling stuffed full and ready to have a nap, that’s a good sign that those

chocolates can live another day.

You might like to enjoy a tea or coffee instead. I’ll often make myself a peppermint tea after a meal and those sweet cravings tend to subside.

Really tune in to your body and listen to your hunger cues – they are critical to all aspects of Christmas eating. And don’t forget, Christmas is just one day. A single day’s indulgence won’t set you off track, it’s the continuous, repeated indulgences that can upset the apple cart.

Wishing you and your loved ones a happy and healthy Christmas!

1pry60b,https://i.redd.it/ul0dfjclnh8g1.jpeg,Never Eat Blueberries With These 5 Foods – They May Harm Your Health!,"Blueberries are known as a powerful and healthy fruit. They are rich in antioxidants like anthocyanins, vitamin C, and lutein, which help reduce inflammation and protect the eyes, heart, and immune system. Regularly eating blueberries may support vision, slow aging-related damage, and improve overall health. However, the benefits of blueberries depend on how they are eaten.

Some food combinations can reduce their positive effects. Eating blueberries with nuts may block iron absorption because both contain compounds that interfere with how the body absorbs minerals. This combination may also cause bloating or stomach discomfort for some people. Drinking black or green tea with blueberries is another poor pairing, as tannins in tea can reduce mineral absorption and irritate sensitive stomachs.

Coffee is also not ideal when eaten with blueberries. Caffeine may increase stomach acid and reduce nutrient absorption, which can limit the fruit’s benefits. Adding blueberries to sugary foods or drinks can overwhelm the body with sugar, increasing inflammation and weakening the antioxidant effects. Highly processed foods containing trans fats can further cancel out blueberry’s protective benefits, especially for eye and heart health.

On the other hand, certain pairings can enhance the benefits of blueberries. Greek yogurt is a great option because it provides protein, calcium, and probiotics that support digestion and blood sugar balance. Leafy greens like spinach and kale work well with blueberries by adding important nutrients that support vision. Whole oats are another good match, offering fiber and minerals that help stabilize energy levels.

Foods rich in vitamin C, such as oranges or bell peppers, can help the body absorb iron more effectively when eaten with blueberries. Low-tannin herbal teas, like chamomile or ginger, are gentle on digestion and do not block nutrients.

In short, blueberries are very healthy, but smart food pairings matter. Avoiding certain combinations and choosing the right ones can help you get the most benefits from this small but powerful fruit.

**Part Two: The Earth Will Not Welcome You** 

I sink into the plush couch as James places cups of coffee on the table. Lee sits in one of the armchairs, his hands clasped tightly in his lap, his right leg bouncing. James takes to leaning against the fireplace across from me, his arms are crossed, and he clutches at his biceps. 

Lee pulls an envelope from his pocket; it’s yellowed a little and is bent at the corners. He sets it on the table and slides it towards me. 

I recognize the handwriting on the front. I think I’d recognize it from anywhere. When Chris first went missing, I’d dream of walking through town and stumbling across a poster stapled onto a utility pole. There’d be a message written on it, indiscernible to anyone but me, with scrawling symbols and signs, a secret language that only two people in the entire world would know. 

Chris and I.

My name's written on the front of it, the envelope. My hands start to sweat.

“He gave me this,” Lee said softly, rubbing at his chin, “before he left. \*‘If anything happens to me, give this to Matty\*.” 

I reach out, and it’s like the air shifts when I touch it. I cradle it in my shaking hands, my breath hitches, and my stomach wobbles in the way it always does when I’m about to cry. 

“Did you- uh… did you read it?” I ask, I don’t know why I bothered asking. If Chris did what I know he had, then no one could read it other than me. Still, it felt private, sacred, as if just seeing the script would taint its sanctity. 

“Of course not,” Lee states, “I’d never.” 

There’s a tense silence, and James breaks his eye contact with me when I turn to look at him. 

He lasts for another moment before he makes a long sigh, “I may have…like, skimmed it.” 

“You \*what?”\* Lee gasps.

I clutch the letter to my chest.

“Just a little!” James defends.

“When the hell did you do that?” Lee leans forward accusingly. 

“Well, when you were-”

“It’s fine! It’s fine.” I interrupt.

“I couldn’t read it anyway,” James says, putting his hand up in surrender. 

“It’s fine.” It wasn’t, but I wasn’t going to get the information I needed by starting an argument. “Would you guys just tell me about the last time you saw him. It might help put this-” I shake the envelope, “into perspective.” 

James moves to sit on the couch, placing a considerable distance between us. “He showed up at my house one night, told me Roger made him too afraid to sleep at home. He didn’t tell me why, not right away, but he stayed with me a couple of nights before he said he had to \*“keep moving”\* or they’d get him.” 

“They?” I whisper. The thought of anyone seeking out Chris for anything bad was almost incomprehensible to me. 

“He never told me,” James answers, “think, maybe, he was worried about me knowing about it. That it would put me in whatever danger he thought he was in.” 

James glances at the letter, “If whatever happened is bad enough that he wrote in a made-up language to communicate it, then maybe it might’ve.” 

“Is that why neither of you told anyone? After he was gone?” I ask, bitterness creeping up on me. 

“He made me promise not to,” James reassures. Lee nods in agreement. “And I’ll admit, leading up to it, I thought he was a little crazy. I mean, you saw him not long before he went missing. He wasn't the same. I thought, the next time he shows up at my house, I’ll \*make\* him tell me everything. But he never came back.”

“He showed up at my place not long after,” Lee says, “that’s when he gave me the letter. I didn’t want to give it to you at first, like, wouldn’t the letter just put you in danger too? I- I don’t know. It’s stupid- I regret it. I should’ve given it to you sooner. I’m sorry.” 

“We should’ve done more than we had,” James whispers, his tone sorrowful, “I’m sorry we didn’t.” 

I nod. I can’t bring myself to reassure them, my head is reeling, and the letter feels like it's burning my hands. Whatever’s in here, it's going to answer everything I’d spent nights thinking about since Chris’s disappearance. No matter how bad I want to read it, there’s a fear that it might not reveal what I hoped— that Chris would only be away for a little while longer and he’d come back for me. 

But if what James and Lee are saying is true, that he was afraid, that he thought people were after him, I suspect that Chris won’t be coming back- not ever. My father would be right, in a way. 

That black pit is back in my stomach, and I clear my throat to get rid of the cry that’s building up. 

“Can you show me to my room?” I ask, my voice is small, and my eyes are glued onto the familiar symbols that make up my name on the front of the letter.

Lee nods, and when I shut the bedroom door behind me and sit on the bed, I find my hands moving on their own, gently peeling back the seal and slipping out the letter. 

I’m a little rusty deciphering it, after almost three years, but I read it. Beginning to end. Then again, beginning to end. I rub my eyes a couple of times before reading through it a third time. 

What’s written in the letter is not something I would have ever expected. But the message is clear. 

Something was happening in Black Rock County, and it had everything to do with my father.  

…

*If you get this letter. I’m sorry.* 

*I took things too far, got too involved. If I hadn’t, you wouldn’t be in the position that you are, and I’d still be around. We’d have run off and started fresh like we planned. I’m sorry that didn’t work out, but you- if anyone- needs to know the truth about what I’m sure will happen to me. The truth about our parents and this fucking town.* 

It’s Monday morning, neither of my parents are home, and I’m standing in my garage. It might even be the exact place Chris stood in late July almost three years ago. I wasn’t around then, instead stuck in a cabin with smelly bunk beds and equally smelly boys who all seemed to hate me for one reason or another. 

*I wasn’t supposed to stumble upon them.*

*I didn’t set out for this to happen, I swear, but once it did there was really no going back. It all started when you were at that weeklong summer camp. I was getting ready for a fishing trip and was looking for the new fishing reel I bought. I checked the top shelf, the one on the opposite side of the door, that’s where I found them.* 

I’m rummaging through old boxes and crates, spilling their contents one by one onto the cold concrete floor. My hands are jittering, random muscles in my body are in a constant state of tightening and release, my breaths are coming out stilted on each inhale and exhale and- Jesus Christ, where the hell are they?

*They were all pictures of girls. Lots of girls. Some I definitely didn’t recognize, and others that looked vaguely familiar. I don’t know how long he’s been doing this, but the earliest date I could find was ‘62.*

They wouldn’t still be here. Of course not. My father may be an asshole, but he’s smart, I can at least give him that. I head for his office. I’ve never been inside. It’s not like it was ever explicitly off limits but, like everything in this family, it went unsaid— implied, with a stony look and a looming threat. I make my way up the stairs, each step creaking louder than I think I’ve ever heard them creak before. Maybe it’s in my head, but every movement and every sound is blasted to outlandish proportions and levels. The air feels like it’s being sucked out with each breath I take, and the walls are closing in around me, like being trapped inside a deflating bounce house.

I place my hand on the doorknob. 

*He had hidden the polaroids there. I just knew he knew that I found them and I just had a feeling that there wasn’t much time left for me. I guess, if you’re really reading this letter, I was right. Maybe I would’ve forced myself to forget about it all if I hadn't come across Layla’s picture.* 

The office was pristine, with a brown desk and matching chair, as if it were selected right out of a Sears catalogue. I took a deep, staggering breath. God, I don’t even know where to start. Towards the back of the room, just behind the desk, was a huge wood hutch that stretched from the floor to the ceiling, with shiny glass cabinet doors and a couple of wide drawers. I make my way towards it, wrapping around the handle of one of the drawers to pull it open. 

It’s locked. 

I look around, my vision almost blurry with how fast my eyes dart around the room. The desk drawers catch my eye. If there’s a key to any of those cabinets, it might be in there. 

*I know this might sound crazy, but do you remember Rene?* 

I reach for the drawer handle, yanking it open. It’s practically empty besides a couple of documents and Post-Its. I heave a long sigh, my hand rising to scratch harshly at my hair, my fingers getting caught in the tight coils. Despite the obvious emptiness of the cabinets, I run my hands along the seams of the wood, around all the corners and under the drawers. 

*Mom’s friend, the one who had to wear those wigs after her cancer treatment. She was looking for something more permanent, Mom told me that once.* 

I repeat the same thorough examination of all the drawers. Nothing. But in the bottom left-hand drawer was a detonic’s pocket 9, loaded. 

*I always remembered Layla for her hair. It was like she walked right out of those Farrah Fawcett commercials we used to see on TV. I thought it was such a shame when she went missing. She was kind, generous, and beautiful. I didn’t talk to her much, but I’d never forget her.* 

*In June, I ran into Rene.* 

I start placing everything I touched back to where it was. Hoping that the next time my father came in here, he wouldn’t immediately know someone else had. As I’m pushing items around on his desk back to where I remember them being, I look up. 

There’s a long, grey filing cabinet tucked into the corner of the room, hidden by a large replica plant. My back straightens, and I move towards it. 

I’m in the middle of the room when the door opens. 

*Rene had new hair.*

 *I thought it was another one of those wigs. It was nice, I thought, long, strawberry blonde, curly, just like the commercial. But then I saw the stitches.*

My father stands in the open doorway, his hand on the doorknob and his suit jacket swung over his shoulder. When he registers my presence, his eyes harden. 

*It almost looked fresh, the small red line around her hairline. I remembered Layla, and then I remembered the photo… I think they took her hair, Matty.* 

“What do you think you’re doing here?” His tone is intense, almost daring. 

The hairs on the back of my neck stand as if they’ve been shocked. The sight of him strikes a new kind of fear into me. I look at his hands. How much blood was on them? Did he ever feel it? The stickiness in the grooves between his fingers, the warmth. Did he ever look at them and notice a red tint?

“Nothing,” I reply, “I- um… I thought I left something here, that’s all.”

It’s a terrible, terrible lie. Maybe, if he knew me any more than he did, he would’ve sniffed it out. 

“There is nothing of yours that is meant to be in this room. Your mother raised you better than to put your nose in places where it doesn’t belong.” 

Is that what he thought of Chris? That he put his nose in a place it didn’t belong?

*I think he sells them.*

 *Their ‘parts’, I mean.* 

*And some of the parents in town get a cut. Our parents, the chief and his wife, who else? I don’t know for sure. But it was the reason I knew I had to get the hell out of here. I would tell someone outside of town, spread the word.* 

“I’m sorry,” I amend, my hands are shaking from where I have them clasped behind my back. 

Is this how Chris felt? As if he was about to crawl out of his skin? Did our father give him the same knowing look? That same looming threat, that dark cloud. I wonder if Chris knew the moment our father looked at him that he made a mistake looking through those pictures– that there was no going back.

I’m almost certain they’re in that filing cabinet. 

“I will not catch you in here again. Do you understand me?” He says, his eyes flicker slightly to the corner of the room.  

*After that, I was gonna come back and take you with me. I guess that didn’t work out.* 

“Right, sorry,” I reply, glancing past his shoulder and into the hallway. 

“Good. Now Get out.” 

I walk past him, or try to, but he doesn’t move and instead just looks at me. I squeeze between his shoulder and the door frame and pop into the hallway. He walks into his office, closes the door behind him, and the lock of the door seems to echo. 

I stumble down the hallway, my hand pressing against the wall as I make my way to my bedroom. I walk in and shut the door before dragging my desk in front of it. I take staggering, halted breaths, my stomach churns, and, before I know it, my cheeks fill with vomit. 

With a hand pressed against my mouth, I rush into the bathroom and nearly miss the toilet.  

…

“I’m sorry, but that’s fucking insane.”

Lee’s bedroom isn’t at all like how I imagined it. I figured it’d be littered with movie posters and hot, half-naked women on the walls. Instead, there are paintings. Good ones too. 

“I had to see,” I defend, sitting on his bed and leaning my head in my hands. “I had to know for sure those pictures existed.” 

“And you thought taking apart the garage and your dad’s office was the best way to go about it? I mean, \*God-”\* Lee practically burns a hole in his rug as he paces back and forth across the room. “You could’ve gotten caught- like actually caught- with the pictures \*in\* your hands. And if what you told me the letter said is true-” 

“It is,” I say, “I know it is.” 

“Then that makes it all even worse! The whole point of telling you any of this was so you \*wouldn’t\* look into it.” Lee realizes his volume has grown and lowers himself to sit next to me, his leg bouncing. 

He’s right about that part. At the end of Chris’ letter he wrote that the reason for writing it was so I knew to get the hell out of Black Rock, no matter what. Not to wait until I was eighteen, or until I had a job or a place to stay lined up, but to just \*go.\* 

It was stupid, wildly stupid, going into that office. For all I know, my father had me at the top of his hit list. 

“I didn’t get the chance to tell Chris this, but I’m telling you now,” Lee grabs my shoulders tight and turns me to face him. His expression is tortured, and I can’t help but think he looks a little like Chris before he went missing. Gaunt, weary, and wary. Guilt creeps up on me. I’m not the only one who lost Chris, and I’m certainly not the only one who feels an overwhelming sense of helplessness. 

“You need to stop,” Lee continues, “because if you don’t, whatever happened to Chris is going to happen to you. I can’t- I can’t let that happen.” 

“I can’t-”

“Oh, get \*real,\* Matt!” Lee’s whisper is harsh, and he glances at his bedroom door. His parents aren’t home but neither of us feel safe enough to speak any louder than in hushed whispers. “This is bigger than us- than you, than \*Chris\*. Why do you think it all went so \*wrong\* so fast? We can’t solve this kind of shit in the summer break between semesters. We have to be smart about this, and that means taking time.” 

I want to object, I really do, but no matter how badly I want to solve this— not just for Chris but for those girls in the pictures- I couldn’t do it if I were dead. If my body were nowhere to be found and my empty casket was lowered into the ground with no date of death written on my tombstone. Chris wouldn’t want that, neither would Lee or James. 

“You’re right,” I reply, my eyes sting, and I keep my gaze on the ground, “I’m just so angry.” 

“I know,” Lee says softly, “We just need to get you away from here, like what Chris was saying… You’re going to college, right? Is it far from here?”

I almost laugh, “Of course it is, it’s miles upon miles away.”

Lee makes a small smile, “Good, fall semester starts in a couple of weeks. Get out of here sooner if you can. I’ll call you regularly, James and I. We’ll figure this out, gradually. Alright?” 

“Aren’t you going to leave too?” I ask, I never asked if they had any plans to leave before. There’s not much I know about Lee or James, honestly, and part of me feels guilty about that. They were such big parts of Chris' life, and I barely knew them. Now, they might be all I have left of him.

Lee shakes his head, “Someone’s gotta keep tabs on things, don’t they?” 

I nod and check my watch. It’s getting late, and I want to make it home before my father does. I’ll lock myself in my room again, place my desk to block my door, and maybe add my wardrobe to it tonight. 

Lee walks me out, and once I’m about to step down the porch stairs, he calls out for me. 

“Matthew?” His voice is small, childlike. As if he were at a sleepover, calling out to his friend to see if they were still awake. 

I turn. 

“You’re older than Chris was when he went missing. I wanna keep it that way, alright?” 

I see a glimpse of Chris in him, just for a moment, and maybe Lee sees him in me, too. It puts a smile on my face and a warmth in my chest I haven’t felt for years now.

“Thanks, Lee,” I say, “I’ll see you around.” 

*I know Lee and James will keep a good eye on you until you escape. They always had for me, I just didn’t let them in the end. I regret that. But I wanted to keep them safe, tell them that for me, alright?* 

…

I was two months into the fall semester of my second year when I got a phone call. 

I felt guilty for being away for so long. Lee, James, and I talked on the phone regularly. They’d update me on my father’s movements and which parents they thought were involved in his… dealings. That’s what we came to call them over time. James said it was a little on the nose, but Lee and I both preferred the clarity. 

Two girls went missing during the time I’d been gone. One from Black Rock and the other from a neighbouring town, a couple of miles north of Pebble Lake. Louise and Janette, respectively. I remember locking myself in my bedroom when I heard the news- missed some classes because of it. It was easy to feel like we were making progress with the consistent phone calls and the gathering of evidence, but hearing the words from Lee’s sad voice caused that wave of helplessness to pull me under all over again. I fell into a depression of sorts, and it lasted about a week and a half before I managed to go back to class again.

I was in my car heading back to my apartment after spending a gruelling couple of hours in the library when I found out. After parking in my spot, I fished out the bag phone from my glove box. 

It wasn’t James or Lee on the other line; it was my mother.

1prxv6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1prxv6q/how_to_love_yourself/,How to love yourself,"It is 2 AM. Your desk lamp is the only light in the house. Your textbooks sit open, another practice paper waiting. In a few hours you need to wake for school, but you push through the exhaustion. Then it happens: one wrong answer. Just one. And suddenly you are at war with yourself, criticizing the person who has been working until their eyes burn, the person who has traded youth's freedom for a hunched back over endless pages. You collapse into sleep during the day because nighttime is not yours anymore. You are carrying the weight of exams that everyone says will determine your entire future. Then someone criticizes you, just once, and you join them. You attack yourself for feeling the pressure, for not being bulletproof, for being human.

“Dear self, you are exhausted. You need to love yourself. But I know what you are thinking: I cannot afford to be soft. My eyes cannot only hold daydreams. They need to see all the futures I am fighting for. You are right. And you are also wrong. Here is what I have learned: True self-love is not weakness. It is the foundation that keeps you standing.

We live under dark clouds: the pressure to outwork everyone, to achieve more, to never be enough. Academic rankings. Workplace competition. Social media comparisons that make you feel like you are losing a race you did not know you had entered. The weight of it all makes our hearts feel like they are about to break.

So when we say “love yourself,” people misunderstand. They think it means giving up. Being lazy. Making excuses. It does not. Loving yourself means acknowledging that you have been trying so hard. It means accepting yourself after genuine effort, even when the results are not perfect. It is not pretending everything is fine. It is giving yourself the emotional space to heal from what hurts.

Think of Simone Biles at the Tokyo Olympics. The greatest gymnast in history stepped back from competition, choosing her mental health over another medal. The world watched. Some criticized. But she knew something crucial: you cannot pour from an empty cup. She loved herself enough to say “not today,” and that decision did not make her weak. It made her wise.

Not every flower needs to be a rose. Not everyone needs to be extraordinary in the same way. If you are not jade but you force yourself to shine like precious stone, you will shatter under the pressure. Even the strongest athletes need rest and care before they can soar again.

But here is the truth we need to face: Self-love without boundaries becomes a trap. I have seen it happen. We are so afraid of being harsh on ourselves that we swing to the other extreme. We call it “self-love” when we avoid challenges. We call it “self-care” when we refuse to grow. We turn temporary rest into permanent retreat. Real self-love is not hiding from storms. It is building the strength to face them.

Think about it: If you use “self-love” as a shield against every difficulty, you will never discover what you are capable of. You will trade the pain of growth for the comfort of staying small. And one day, you will wake up and realize that protecting yourself from failure also protected you from becoming.

There is an old story about a boy named Fang Zhongyong, born with extraordinary talent. At five, he could write beautiful poems without any training. His father paraded him around town, collecting praise and payment from amazed crowds. But he never let the boy study or practice. By adulthood, Fang Zhongyong's gift had vanished completely. He became ordinary, not because he lacked ability, but because comfort felt easier than growth. Does that not tell us something? Should that not warn us?

So here is what authentic self-love looks like: It is holding yourself when you are exhausted. Encouraging yourself when you are lost. And yes, pushing yourself when you want to quit. It is both the embrace and the challenge. The rest and the call to rise. It is knowing when to say: “You have done enough for today. Sleep. Heal.” And when to say: “I know you are scared, but you can do this. Get up. Try again.”

What this actually means for tomorrow: After you fail an exam, give yourself permission to feel disappointed. Cry if you need to. Then, when you are ready, start again. When work overwhelms you, reward yourself. Buy that coffee. Take that walk. Then return to the challenge with fresh eyes. When your parents compare you to your cousin who got into NUS Law, remind yourself: their path is not yours, and that is okay. 

This kind of self-love does not make you weak. It makes you sustainable. We need to understand something: Life is not a straight line where we constantly climb upward. You will fall. It will hurt. You will need to rest. And that is okay. When you stumble, let yourself feel it. When it hurts badly, sleep. Let yourself recover. Taking sick leave requires a doctor's note. But loving yourself? That only requires your own permission.

Here is what I want you to try: Tomorrow, when that critical voice starts, and it will start, pause. Take a breath. Ask yourself: Would I say this to someone I love? If the answer is no, do not say it to yourself. Not today. Not anymore. You replay conversations in your head, cataloging every mistake. You see someone else's success and feel like you are falling behind. You work until you can barely think straight, then hate yourself for being tired. Stop. You are not behind. You are not failing. You are learning what it means to be human in a world that demands perfection.

“Love yourself.” I will see you tomorrow. Tomorrow brings sunrise. It brings the bright heat of noon. It brings evening moonlight that will catch in your hair and remind you that you are still here, still trying, still enough. Even on days when you do not feel like it, you are enough.",6,1766291991.0,SGExams,3,1.0,False
1prxuna,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechnoBarkDogGear/comments/1prxuna/thinking_about_a_dog_subscription_box/,Thinking About a Dog Subscription Box,"I was looking at dog subscription boxes at this post ( [https://technobark.com/best-dog-subscription-boxes/](https://technobark.com/best-dog-subscription-boxes/) ) and I’ve probably wasted a ridiculous amount of money on toys already.

I feel like everyone’s tried at least one dog subscription box by now, especially BarkBox. It’s everywhere for a reason. The themes are fun, the treats are solid, and for dogs that actually enjoy plush toys, I can see why people stick with it. The excitement alone made it feel worthwhile. Super Chewer is like the obvious upgrade if your dog is a wrecking ball. Rubber, nylon, heavier stuff. I keep seeing people say their dogs still have toys from old Super Chewer boxes, which honestly sounds fake but also… maybe some toys really are just built different. I wish I had switched sooner instead of buying the same “durable” toys over and over that were not durable at all.

I also saw WoofPack mentioned a lot and that one actually caught my attention more because of the treats. My dog had stomach issues in the past and I’m way more cautious now. Cleaner treats, fewer ingredients, not just random stuff thrown in. That matters more to me now than cute packaging. Pooch Perks seems good if you hate surprises. Being able to choose toy types makes sense because some dogs straight up do not care about certain toys. I’ve wasted so much money on toys my dog ignored completely. Customizing would’ve helped. PupJoy’s power chewers box also came up, especially for people who want tougher toys but don’t want the same big brands every month. Apparently they include more smaller or boutique brands, which could be fun if your dog gets bored easily. Paws for a Cause is kind of different. It’s dog stuff plus human stuff and supports rescues. I don’t hate that. Also getting coffee in a dog box feels extremely accurate for dog parents.

Reading all this just reminded me how much trial and error dog toys really are. My dog used to destroy everything, now she’s more selective, but durability still matters. A toy lasting more than a week is a success at this point.

My husband (51m) and I (42F) began dating over 10 years ago.

During our 6 hour first date, we hit it off with humor.

He was creative,romantic, funny, he loved to make jokes, to have fun, to be with friends, and he took his fitness seriously. He wasn’t built like the Rock, but he looked incredible to me.

After 4.5 years of dating, we got engaged and only to get married a couple of months later due to the COVID restrictions that were upon us.

It worked out, as our actual marriage was outside in a free spot with just parents, and each of our best friends, which ended up saving us a lot of money.

My husband had put on some weight that summer but I wasn’t concerned because most people were due to Covid.

Once we got married, it’s as though a switch just flipped:

3-5 times a week of sex was normal prior to marriage. The second we got married it changed.

We have had a dead bedroom for the last 5 years. I think we had intimacy once when we were both mildly intoxicated and one other time when I begged.

It’s been about 2 years since we’ve been intimate. I’ve cried to him about how I miss this connection. He tells me not to worry; it’s not me, it’s because his weight has ballooned and it has nothing to do with me.  he tells me that we “can just be intimate in other ways like snuggling.”

He is depressed and uninterested in fixing our dead bedroom because when we fist met he weighed 230 lbs. when we got married 5 years later he was probably about 260. He’s sadly kept gaining since then and now he’s at 360+. What scares me is that I fear his health is also taking a turn for the worst: he’s angry and agitated and negative all of the time. Nothing positive or happy or joyful or creator can ever come out of his mouth anymore and I fell in love with someone who was a cheerful, creative positive person.

Each day starts with and ends with negativity: his knees hurt. His feet hurt. His stomach hurts. The coffee wasn’t good. He feels nauseated. He didn’t like his breakfast. His doctor is cocky. His shirt is scratchy. All while he belches and coughs and uncontrollably flatulates.

I can’t share a bed with him anymore because he thrashes around and makes noise so I’m stuck in the guest space.

He often needs canes or walkers due to his heavy size. My bedroom looks like a care facility, with a nightstand full of pill bottles, inhalers, walkers for him to get up, canes hanging from his night stand, dozens of other pill bottles everywhere, the bed sitting upright.

He also requires that I trim and clean his feet as his toenails are brittle ingrown and yellow. He can’t reach them. I don’t mind, but I what is he doing to take steps to reach them?

He requires a bidet because he cannot clean himself after using the toilet. None of his clothes fit. He can’t go on walks with me. He is interested in smoking weed, eating and football. That’s it. He doesn’t want to get well. I made big healthy salads for dinner tonight that he used to like, and he knew I was making them. He brought  himself home McDonald’s: 3 sandwiches and a large order of nuggets. He smokes pot and eats. That’s all he cares about. I feel betrayed. I feel angry. And for some strange reason a part of me feels lonely.",71,1766291621.0,TrueOffMyChest,50,0.94,False

From my research I saw you need a gooseneck kettle, a paper filter, coffee grounds (maybe a grinder too), and a dripper. Also a glass ""carafe / server?""

I want to go buy these things and try it. 

Generally, is this gooseneck kettle supposed to be placed on the stove to heat the water inside? I know people often use those things you put on a thing and press the button and it automatically heats it with energy but those often are made from plastic. 

Is there a name for the glass thing it goes into, so I know to get the right one.

Help me decide?,"My Situation: I’m looking for a pair of high-end wireless headphones for everyday use (commuting, office work, walking). I’m currently debating between the Sennheiser Momentum 4, Sony WH-1000XM5, and the Bose QC Ultra.

My Priorities (In order):

1. Battery Life / ""Less Charge"": I hate charging things constantly. I need something that can go a long time without dying on me.
2. Sound Quality: I want them to sound great for music.
3. Call Quality: I take calls in somewhat noisy environments (office/coffee shops), so the mic needs to be solid.
4. ANC: Needs to handle office chatter and commuting noise well.

My Dilemma:

* Sennheiser M4: The 60-hour battery is huge for me, and I hear the sound is the best. But I’m worried about the ANC—specifically, does it actually block out office voices? Also heard about some connection bugs/firmware issues—are those still a thing in late 2025?
* Sony XM5: Everyone says these are the kings of ANC and Calls, but the 30-hour battery feels low compared to Sennheiser. Is the comfort actually an issue for long sessions?
* Bose QC Ultra: I know these are comfortable, but the battery life seems the weakest of the bunch.

The Wildcard: Someone also recommended the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 because of the 100-hour battery. Has anyone actually used these? Are the ANC and calls good enough to compete with Sony/Bose?

Question: Based on my need for low maintenance (battery) but good call quality, which one is the safer bet? Is the Sony mic/ANC worth the drop in battery life compared to the Sennheiser?

Thanks!

1prxns4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FathersJourney/comments/1prxns4/i_need_to_know_everything/,I need to know everything,"*Please know that this is seriously raw.  I typed this straight out of my brain without pause and you know that I do that, but there’s usually a meter and sometimes I delete things.  I haven’t done that here.  I think I’m realizing that I’ve reached a place where I need to know and to settle some things*.

\--

I have always needed to know more of what happened that night.  But there are a hundred reasons why I put off learning or seeing—I wasn’t ready.  I was frightened of the images.  All the while, I had Zach to worry about. 

But even now, it’s the first thing I think about when I wake each morning.  And I don’t it to be.

I wrote recently of my melancholy for Zach being on his own.  I didn’t know what I was saying at the time or that there was more to it than I realized.  I pushed him out of his nest, if only next door, and it was the right thing to do.  He was ready.  He was ready to have his own space and to run his own life. 

God knows that I never want him to fail.  I am his champion, after all—I love him.  But I wonder if a part of me needed him to fail, just a little bit, and I know that sounds insane, but hear me out.  He’s doing far better than I expected.  He’s managing money and all the daily tasks and he hasn’t needed me to fix things or to make sense of them and there is a joy in that.  But it also means that the worry I’ve carried on my back since that night isn’t there anymore.  Not the way it was.  And that changes things.

Here’s the thing… if Suzanne was alone that night, I would not have survived—full stop.  It’s a hard thing to admit.  The boys wouldn’t be who they are today; my life wouldn’t have changed the way it did and I don’t doubt that because it’s absolutely true.  She was my world.  I was more selfish then.  I would have fallen apart, maybe I would have drank or disappeared, if I was allowed to.  But I wasn’t because Zach needed me.  And because he was my son, I gave him all of me.  And, in the end, it saved me.

Today, he’s working a very real job, advancing and learning and getting certified on so many things.  He’s driving a car, he’s keeping a home.  He’s really okay.

So I guess now, I’m back to me.  And although I love and am I’m loved again, I am unresolved.  It’s weird, but I feel like I’m realizing some things for the first time.  At the same time, my love for Dot is safe. 

I remember a long time ago telling you that I didn’t have time to mourn her.  That was true.  But I seem to have the time now.  And I don’t know how to do it.

Tonight, the people I love the most are angry with me, but I’ll just have to deal with that.  As I said to Dot, “This is never going away.” 

I don’t expect to come to peace, for whatever that means, but I should expect to find a place of reason, if not calm.  I need to rest my mind.  And it’s reasonable that I’m trying to do just that.  I  found myself able to feel something after viewing the interviews with the bad man. 

Viewing those interviews was harder than I’ll ever explain, but it was also cathartic.  It gave me something to hold; something real.  I won’t tell you that I feel better.  But I will say that I feel more grounded for knowing and seeing with my own eyes.

Dot said something rather profound.  She said that the effort of viewing the video put boundaries around something that had always been vague.  And that’s the whole point.

I was in counseling after the accident, and even though I wasn’t always receptive, I remember him telling me that the day would come when I would need to know.  And he told me that I would seek to learn every moment, and that I should. 

That advice falls flat here on the farm.

You see, I now want to see it all—everything.  And I mean *everything*.  I will ask Prick for a couple of hours and a quiet conference room where I will see everything there is to see.  And I am braced for the fight.

It hasn’t gone over well.  Dot was reserved but unsettled, while Dan threatened to conspire with Prick Lawyer to swear out a restraining order, and maybe he was kidding at first.  But he wasn’t kidding for long.  He told me in no uncertain terms that he would not allow it. 

That may seem presumptuous coming from a friend, but Dan has earned any position he takes in this story and I respect him.  And so I would need to make him understand and I failed. 

“You want to be in the car with them!” He said angrily.

“Yes.” I answered. 

He doesn’t get it.  And frankly, I thank God for that. 

You see, I loved her.  And I needed to be with her in that moment and I wasn’t.  Zach is my child and the strength of that is greater than I’ll ever understand.  I needed to be there with him and I wasn’t. 

I don’t remember much of that night.  But I do remember when they showed me photographs of her hand and her ring and I nodded.  The man was kind.  He said, “She never knew; she never felt a thing.”  They didn’t tell me her condition, but I knew.  They wouldn’t let me see her because of her condition.  Her casket was closed; I get it.  But I don’t know how to make people understand what that’s like.  I know I’m not the only one, I know this happens.  But unless it happens to you, it’s not going to make sense.  I still wanted to see her regardless; I would have found a place to touch and to say goodbye.  And maybe I would have fought it, were it not for Zach.  And maybe she was telling me that he was the only priority I had in those hours.  And I know that’s right.

Debbie, of fire rescue, was assigned to him on scene and I wrote of her in the early days, long before this little sub.  I wrote of all of them (it’s when Zach was walking again and I catered a lunch for the rescue team so they could see him).  Her job was to care about him while the rest did the necessary work of getting him out.  They called him Snoopy, because they didn’t know his name. He was wearing a Snoopy shirt that night.  He was in and out of reality.  Debbie explained how, as they were working on him, Zach told her that he was waiting for his mom and he asked if she had seen her.  She was very guarded when we spoke, and so was I.  I remember being terrified of what she might tell me because I wasn’t ready to hear it.  She admitted there were a couple of bad moments, but she intentionally didn’t explain, and I didn’t ask then.  I didn’t want to know at the time – I was overwhelmed.

There are so many pieces in the puzzle that are left to be fit, and the people in my life don’t seem to understand that or that I need to meet Zach in the middle by knowing where he was.  To them, it was a horrific moment that ended very quickly.  But there’s more.  And I want to know every part of it.

For example—and you would have to go way back with me to remember—the night we had tacos at Dan’s.  It was one of the first times we took Zach out.  He was in the smaller brace then, if I remember.  Jackie unfurled a yellow blanket on the floor next to the coffee table where the boys were making their tacos and Zach lost his mind.  It was terrifying.  He went to the front door, like he needed to get out, and ended up on the landing of the steps, beating himself with his fists.  We had no idea what was happening.

It took more than two years to figure out what could have caused it and it was only after a chance meeting with Debbie.  When I explained the event, she offered the possible reason. 

They covered Suzie with a yellow tarp.  When I asked her if he realized, she said “maybe.” 

Zach hasn’t worn yellow since; he doesn’t like yellow anymore.  It wasn’t anything we talked about, it just was.  He doesn’t wince anymore, but he doesn’t like it.  The irony is that it used to be his favorite color.  I have a video of him when he was in a little production in kindergarten, listing his favorite things.  He called it “Lellow.”

You see, I have to understand these things—it’s my job.  I want all these parts and I want to understand.  

I know that I’ve avoided details all along, sometimes like a child, plugging my ears and humming.  But I don’t want to do that anymore. 

I have bits of data and I’ve heard things in passing that I never pursued.  I never read the coroner’s report; I don’t have it.  Prick does.  Suzanne was demolished in the accident, but I remember hearing someone say how her body protected Zach’s.  I neither recall who said it or when.  But I need to know.  I want to know.

Dan is very frustrated with me tonight.  He didn’t see Zach for some time after the accident, but of course I did.  I saw him pretty raw—before he was cleaned.  He already had his first emergency surgery by then, before they even bothered with his hip, and it was all so hasty.  And I remember them taking me into the room and I remember a weird sense of relief, which lasted no more than a few seconds, because it wasn’t him—I didn’t recognize him.  It was all a mistake.  I had to pull the covers off of him to see his body, to see his little feet and the freckle on his toe to be sure.

Zach is so beautiful.  He was always beautiful.  He’s still beautiful.   He makes young girls giggle to this day.  And he’s kind and he’s generous.  He’s everything he was before.  And I know he loves me special, for everything we’ve been through.  Because his recovery is “us” – he was never alone.  We have a very different relationship now; it’s very personal and unique.  We’re war buddies.

But I know that he has flashes of memory now, especially over this past year and I need to meet him there.  I need to know where he was and what he saw because it is unreasonable for him to carry that alone.    

I asked to meet with Prick, and I will be impassioned in my plea.  I know in the end he will let relent and I know it will be a hard day.  But I’m absolutely ready. ",8,1766291338.0,FathersJourney,1,1.0,False

1prxli6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prxli6,It's late & I'm tired...Polish S-RG-4 Meal A,"So this big fella kept sliding onto my floor from the pile. I guess it need to get in my belly for dinner. These dudes are ginormous and have loads of goodies packed away in their depths. I decided to meal A for dinner tonight. The directions called for the Mexican chicken stew, honey, pâté, crisp bread, lime flavored green tea and a chocolate orange drink. I'll eat meal B tomorrow and maybe a snack with the chocolate. This ration took a beating in transit and the cans are dented pretty bad and they even managed to break the hardtack in it. 

This is the first time I've had this menu and was excited to try it. The crisp breads are light and airy with a nice whole wheat flavor. Personally I think these are my second favorite after the old school US MRE crackers. They're far better eating that the hardtack SU-1 biscuits you get in these meals. I give them a solid 8.5/10. They pretty much dissolve on contact with liquid so I keep them to spreads and pâté. Speaking of the pâté, it came with a basic pork/pork liver that was lightly seasoned. The texture of this one was very creamy, likely due to the milk powder. Reminded me of potted meat but creamier. There was no overwhelming liver flavor and you could taste the onion. I ate about half of it as I ran out of crisp bread and was getting full anyway. I want to experiment a bit with the leftovers tomorrow. I'm going to pair it with some dill pickle and capers and a few dashes of hot sauce. I'd give it a 7/10. It's pretty plain but tasty nonetheless. 

The Polish rations have some of my favorite drinks in the form of the flavored teas. It's an instant tea that comes in pellet form, kind of like hamster food. It called for 250mL of H2O but I went with closer to 400mL and it was just fine. It had a nice, light lime flavor that went down easy. This was 8/10 for me. Seriously, if I could source this in the flavors I like I'd buy a case. Shipping would be egregious but it's only money and you can't take with you. Next up was the chocolate orange drink. This was the first time I had it and finished my meal with. It tasted just like a Terry's chocolate orange. That's the best way I can describe it. Coincidentally the orange Coke tastes like that to me too. I wouldn't mind getting my hands in some of it too. I made with hot water instead of cold. I probably wouldn't use as the chocolate base for a mocha though. This was 8/10 for me. 

Last but not least...the Polish take on a Mexican chicken stew. This can was severely dented on the bottom which caused the top to bulge a bit. So I was actually worried that the top had been compromised and it was going to be bad. After inspecting the lid, I couldn't find any damage to it. I opened it and took big old whiff and was greeted with the smell of canned chicken. I emptied it and heated it on the stove for about 15 minutes or so to thoroughly heat it. Basically it's like a chicken chili that had dark red kidney beans and corn along with a huge amount of both light and dark meat. It had a thin chili flavor, not quite chili con carne. More like a brown gravy stew that the chili powder was added for coloring and a bit of flavor. It was well seasoned in that you could taste the onion, garlic and other spices but it really benefited from some salt. Hot sauce would've been perfect but I wasn't in the mood for it. The dark meat was tender and juicy while the white meat was on the drier side. This why I typically only use dark meat chicken. I still give it a solid 8/10. A bit more seasoning and a touch of heat would made it a 9 or 9.5. 

Overall it's been a great menu so far. Also NATO needs to mandate hot sauce of some kind be required in all MREs. It's 2025 folks a I know you have people that enjoy some spice. It doesn't need to be burn your butthole spicy but something to put a little zip in the food. Especially if you're going to make Mexican and Texmex style food. ",5,1766291129.0,MRE,1,0.86,False

My dad shows up mid-afternoon with his girlfriend in tow. She’s energetic in a way that feels dangerous. She immediately asks if she can help cook, already reaching for a cutting board before my mom can answer. Mom pauses for half a second too long, then says yes, because saying no would somehow be worse.

My sister arrives last—fresh off a flight from Germany, married, exhausted, and running purely on airport coffee and vibes. She gives quick hugs, drops her bag by the door, and sinks into a chair like she might not stand up again. She’s quiet, jet-lagged, and observant, taking everything in without saying much.

I float between rooms, refilling drinks, translating passive-aggressive comments into something polite, pretending everything is normal. Dad’s girlfriend keeps offering help. Mom keeps saying she’s got it. Dad keeps hovering like he’s afraid to sit down.

No one brings up how weird this all is. We just keep moving, keep cooking, keep talking about flights and recipes and the weather—like the awkwardness won’t spill if we don’t look at it too hard.

A bit about each character- 

Mom
She’s the kind of person who shows love through doing. Cooking, cleaning, hosting—if her hands are busy, her feelings don’t have to be. The divorce hardened her a little, but mostly made her quieter about her hurt. She insists she’s fine, even when she’s clearly not, and takes pride in holding things together. Holidays matter to her, even when they hurt.

Dad
He’s trying—sometimes too hard. After the divorce, he leaned into being “easygoing,” using jokes and charm to smooth over discomfort. He hates conflict and avoids heavy conversations, even when they’re necessary. Bringing his girlfriend feels like proof that he’s moved on, though a part of him still feels awkward being back in this house.

Sister
Recently married and living overseas, she feels slightly out of sync with everyone now. The distance changed her; she’s calmer, more observant, and less interested in old family dynamics. Jet-lagged and quiet, she listens more than she speaks, choosing her words carefully when she does talk.

Dad’s Girlfriend
She genuinely wants to help. A fixer by nature, she fills silence with kindness, offers assistance as a peace offering, and tries hard to be liked without overstepping—though she sometimes does anyway. She’s aware she’s an outsider and compensates with enthusiasm, hoping effort can bridge history.

1prxj13,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1prxj13/the_time_i_accidentally_became_my_buildings/,"The Time I Accidentally Became My Building's ""Emergency Pet Sitter"" For A Week","It started last Monday when I heard frantic scratching at my door at 6 AM – I live in a small condo in Quezon City, and I’d barely gotten 4 hours of sleep after pulling an all-nighter for work.
 
I peek through the peephole and see my neighbor Ate Mylene looking panicked, holding a carrier with a fluffy orange cat and a plastic bag full of stuff. Before I can even say ""good morning,"" she blurts out that her mom just had a stroke and she needs to rush to Pampanga right now – no time to call the pet sitter she’d booked, and the only other person she knows in the building is me (we’d only ever chatted briefly in the elevator about how her cat, Mochi, likes to steal her slippers).
 
I’m still half-asleep but I say yes immediately – how could I not? She hands me Mochi’s carrier, a list of instructions longer than my work to-do list, and says she’ll be back in 2 days max.
 
Spoiler: She wasn’t back in 2 days.
 
Day 1 was fine – Mochi hid under my couch for most of it, only coming out to eat and use the litter box I’d set up in my bathroom. I thought, ""This is easy!""
 
Day 2 – Mochi decides my entire apartment is his playground. He knocks over my coffee mug onto my laptop (thankfully it was just warm water), unrolls an entire roll of toilet paper, and somehow manages to open my kitchen cabinet to get to a bag of dried fish snacks I’d hidden. I text Ate Mylene – she says her mom is stable but they need a few more days.
 
Day 3 – I wake up to find Mochi curled up on my pillow, purring like a tiny motor. We’re starting to bond. I even make a quick trip to the pet store near Fisher Mall to get him new toys and more food. The cashier asks if he’s mine, and I just say ""temporarily adopted.""
 
Day 4 – My work calls for an unexpected onsite meeting in Makati. I’m panicking because I can’t leave Mochi alone all day. I end up bringing him with me in his carrier – my boss sees him and actually says he can stay in the conference room as long as he’s quiet. Mochi spends the whole meeting sleeping under the table, and by the end, half the office has stopped by to pet him.
 
Day 5 – Ate Mylene texts to say she might be back by Sunday. Mochi has now claimed my favorite blanket and follows me around like a little orange shadow. I catch myself talking to him like he understands everything I say (I may have told him about my crush on the barista at my usual coffee spot).
 
Day 6 – I come home to find Mochi sitting by the door, as if he knows Ate Mylene is coming back soon. I feel a weird pang in my chest – I didn’t realize how much I’d gotten used to having him around.
 
Day 7 – Sunday morning, Ate Mylene knocks on my door with tears in her eyes. Her mom is doing much better, and she brings me homemade adobo and a framed photo of Mochi as a kitten to say thank you. As she’s packing up his things, Mochi keeps looking back at me and meowing.
 
We make a deal – I get to be Mochi’s ""honorary uncle"" and can babysit him anytime she needs. Last night, she sent me a video of Mochi sleeping with the toy I bought him.
 
Turns out, sometimes the best things in life start with a frantic 6 AM knock on the door.",24,1766290912.0,story,4,0.93,False
