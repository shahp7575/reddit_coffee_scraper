However, I have partially lost my ability to emotionally adapt to people and handle social emotional situations successfully. I seem to have no patience and default to being in fight and flight mode and toxic behaviors. 

This started after I combined Lexapro 20 mg with several cups of coffee a day, and became severely bad after I stopped Lexapro over two weeks taking random irregular doses to taper down. 

I come from complex family and job dynamics, that I was able to handle using fear, molding to people's emotions, being pleasant, people pleasing, etc. 

Now it is like brain damage and I cannot do that. 

My situation is worsened by working at night during a night shift and sleeping during the day, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, bad diet, etc. ",2,1751159056.0,PSSD,1,1.0,False

He kept all of us up until 3 a.m; not with his music but by staying outside on the porch during a thunderstorm. There was no reason to trust he'd some inside and remember to lock all the doors while he was at it. H approved those concerns right by falling asleep out there around 2:30 a.m. and because his music was still going, neither of us noticing for almost a half hour. Why he could do all that upstairs in his room, only his drunken self will know. On the bright side when I finally did get to bed, Peach cuddled with me quite sweetly. She usually only sleeps with me in the mornings. Maybe Father's shenanigans got her feeling exhausted too.

As you may imagine, I haven't been in my best shape mentally. I did write. I went outside at my usually time but it was a bit of the cooler side and the wind was annoying. I wrote one long paragraphs - probably around 300 words - before I got both cold, hungry, and tired. I'm been fighting back a headache for a while now. I'm going to try to finish that one empty spot in that scene tonight with my evening coffee. By that time I'm sure I'll be a little more bright-minded.

I did also try to colour my drawing of Emmeline. I don't think watercolours are going to work out well on my printing paper. I might have to go out to buy some watercolour paper. For now, it works out okay once it dries but it doesn't spread very well. I'm using this skin colour markers and they can be a little difficult. The color is great but the marker strokes are very visible and it gives the skin an unpleasant texture. You have to be very careful and it is very easy to overdo it by going back over and over to try to 'fix' the texture issues. I'm going to ink the teacher too just to see how it looks. I'll be sure to take pictures before I color in case I ruin the originals. Pocket the snowshoe rabbit, as you'd expect, doesn't need much colouring but I'll ink her pencil lines.

All in all, today could have been much better but for what it was, it also could have been much worse.

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!

I just read an interesting new study tracking 46,000 adults over 10 years. Researchers found that drinking 1‚Äì3 cups of coffee daily is linked to a lower risk of death (around 14‚Äì17% less overall mortality). But here‚Äôs the catch: this benefit only applied to people who drank black coffee or used very little cream and sugar.

https://preview.redd.it/klps0at0mr9f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00623a045dc63ee93514373a68966ac13f835fa

Adding lots of sugar and saturated fat doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcancel out‚Äù the antioxidants in coffee, but it does bring its own health risks‚Äîextra calories, worse heart health, higher mortality over time. Basically, too much cream and sugar tips the balance.

The researchers defined ‚Äúlow additives‚Äù as under 5% of your daily recommended sugar/fat intake (for an 8 oz cup, that‚Äôs about half a teaspoon of sugar and one small spoon of cream). More than that, the benefits start to fade.

There are limitations (like only measuring coffee habits once or twice), but overall, it reinforces what many nutritionists already say: go easy on sugar and saturated fat, enjoy your coffee in moderation, and you‚Äôll likely get the best health benefits.

If you love cream and sugar in your cup, no need to panic‚Äîjust be mindful of how much you use. And don‚Äôt overdo the caffeine‚Äîmore than 2‚Äì3 cups a day could cause anxiety or heart issues.

Anyone here cut back on the extras in their coffee and feel a difference?

‚ÄúCome down to my office and we will explain everything‚Äù responded Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúFine all five of us‚Äù.

Newsome agreed. The five of them walked into Newsome‚Äôs isolated office. Liam stared at the ground,¬† looking very uncomfortable.¬†

Michael had felt sick to his stomach. He had allowed something traumatizing to happen to Cain once. These people he was with, if he had any suspicion they were part of the kidnapping, he was going to go hands on. They entered Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office and Mr. Newsome began talking.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Vortox, your son Liam was snooping around my classroom and started yelling profanities as a joke.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust why the hell would he do that? Where‚Äôs Cain?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe ran out the school doors, I think your son Liam riled him trying to play jokes.‚Äù

Barnliver chimed in ‚ÄúYes I think we will have to discipline them when we get Cain back. Probably after school detention for both of them.‚Äù¬†

Michael stared at both of them. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like something either of them would do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam‚Äôs actually had a history of horseplay last year and the year before‚Äù

Michael sighed and began to walk around the office. He knew his boys weren‚Äôt perfect but if words had a scent, this would be bullshit.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if I refuse to make them do after school detention. Would they get out of school detention?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want your children in school Mr. Vortox?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be honest, I don‚Äôt trust the three of you right now, I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†

Newsome grabbed a bag and started digging around. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt trust me, I will get all the logs that shows the progress Cain has been making.‚Äù¬†

Michael looked around his office and saw data logs on his computer. There were logs of ‚Äúdistances variable could fly‚Äù, ‚Äúfire variable‚Äù ,‚Äúobjects variable can move‚Äù. Michael was horrified. This wasn‚Äôt a classroom.¬†

Newsome‚Äôs eyes grew wide. He had been sloppy. How could he have left that up? He set the bag down and grabbed another. He began to maneuver around behind Michael and next to Liam.

Michael glared at Mr. Barnliver and growled ‚ÄúJust what the fuck operation are you-

Mr. Newsome shuffled through the bag and pulled out a pistol with a silencer on it and shot Michael in the back of the head. Michael‚Äôs entire body shook and straightened out momentarily. Blood sprayed the wall and Mr. Barnliver. Michael‚Äôs body fell to the ground. Liam screamed and swatted the gun out of Newsome‚Äôs hand. Liam and Newsome both dove on the ground wrestling for position to grab the pistol. Mr. Barnliver ran over and picked up the pistol. Newsome yelled ‚ÄúFinish him!‚Äù¬†

Barnliver pointed the gun at Liam as lay crying on the floor. His finger went to the trigger when something zoomed into the room and hit Barnliver with such force that they went through the wall. Liam heard footsteps from the opposite end of the room¬† and looked back. It was Geraldson. Geraldson stared at Michael‚Äôs body while a pool of blood began to flow underneath. Liam crawled out of the office. He couldn‚Äôt look at his dad‚Äôs body any longer.¬†

‚ÄúYou are all under arrest‚Äù commanded Officer Gerald. ‚ÄúLiam go outside.‚Äù Liam nodded and began to run out.¬†

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù a voice rang out from the hole in the wall. Mr. Barnliver‚Äôs severed head was tossed through a hole in Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúLiam are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain stay in there!‚Äù¬†

Cain walked out. Glared at Newsome and Shultz who looked visibly frightened. Cain looked down at his dad‚Äôs body. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He grew red.¬†

‚ÄúShoot him, he's the dangerous one!‚Äù Shultz yelled out pointing at Cain.¬†

Cain grabbed her arm and snapped it into two. Ms. Shultz opened her mouth to scream but Cain grabbed a coffee mug sitting on the desk and shoved it down her throat. Muffled screaming came out of Ms. Shultz‚Äôs stuffed throat. Geraldson yelled for Cain but Cain waved his hand and set him flying back twenty feet.¬†

‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE!‚Äù yelled Cain in a deep voice unlike his own. Newsome began to run out of his office but Cain sent a force into his left knee making it unusable. Cain lifted both of them and threw them through the gymnasium doors. Geraldson ran and hit the fire alarm. This was going to get ugly if he didn‚Äôt get the other students out of the building. Cain levitated a foot off the ground and floated into the gymnasium. Officer Riddle ran around the corner and saw Cain floating and two other adults floating. ‚ÄúCain stop or I will have to shoot!‚Äù Cain waived his hand and tipped the bleachers on top of Officer Riddle. Cain screamed which shook the entire school. Officer Geraldson ran outside and directed the other officers to evacuate the other students. Cain ripped off Ms. Shultz‚Äôs limbs from her torso and threw the pieces to the side. It was just him and Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be this way Cain. We can get away from this.‚Äù¬†

Tears flew from Cain‚Äôs face as he roared ‚ÄúYou killed my father!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe world can be yours Cain.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt already is.‚Äù¬†

Cain lifted his hands and set Newsome on fire. Newsome screamed as he became a floating human torch. Cain screamed back as he made the fire hotter and hotter. Then Cain screamed and blew roof off of the gymnasium. Still levitating, Cain levitated down the halls of the school destructing the windows, walls and whatever stood in his way.¬†

Lara ran off and got into her car when Riddle had left. She had heard Geraldson on the radio. Cain was at the school. As she pull up she saw the school imploding from the inside. Students and adults were running away. Running for their lives. Lara parked in the parking lot. The entrance exploded. Cain walked out of the entrance his surroundings were lighting on fire as he passed. Some cops were trying to get in range to take the shot. No.. she couldn‚Äôt lose her baby again. Lara got out of her car.¬†

‚ÄúNo stop! Don‚Äôt shoot please! Cain stop this!‚Äù¬†

Lara ran toward Cain. She promised Cain she would never let anything happen to him again. She couldn‚Äôt sit back and watch him go again.¬†

An officer hiding behind his car held up his pistol and shot. Lara jumped front of Cain with her arms out. She was hit in the chest. Lara took a deep breath in and wheezed. Cain snapped out of his rage and caught his mother before she fell. He looked up and put a force field around him and Lara.¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù¬†

Lara smiled and touched his face. ‚ÄúCain.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no not you too. Why?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain‚Ä¶‚Äù she forced out a laugh and a little blood trickled out of her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúI always wanted to be good mom‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be disappointed in me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI could never be disappointed in you baby. I‚Äôm disappointed in the world and what they‚Äôve put us through.‚Äù She glanced out of the forcefield to see cops shooting at them with no effect.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too mom. Please don‚Äôt leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù Cain was crying watching his mom take her last breath. She began to struggle and Cain held her tighter. Then she was still. Cain laid her down staring at her. He slowly turned to the cop cars raised his hands up and blew every squad car up in front of him. Then he started blowing up the cars behind them.¬†

Geraldson could see the town being destroyed before his very eyes. Explosion after explosion. Bodies flying past him. Everything behind him was on fire. Geraldson broke his promise to always protect Cain and ran the opposite direction as far as he could.¬†

Liam was running but the explosions and fires were catching up fast. Everything was going to be destroyed until the army came in and took Cain out. Liam stopped. Living in a world where Cain died didn‚Äôt feel worth it. Liam ran toward the destruction. Floating ten feet off the ground, he saw his brother blowing up buildings and cars.¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain you have to stop. You‚Äôve taken out the cult. You are hurting innocent people now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey took mom. They took mom Liam.‚Äù¬†

Liam looked down at the ground and tears fell.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end all of them Liam.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEven me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúDenny?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo not Denny either.‚Äù

‚ÄúCain these houses, they belong to people like us. People like Denny. People like Charlotte or Carlie. You have to stop and go. If you don‚Äôt the military is going to take you out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to be around anymore Liam.‚Äù Liam could feel the fire closing in around him.¬†

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do it for yourself. Do it for me. We are all we have Liam. I can‚Äôt go on without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done too much Liam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre still my brother.‚Äù Liam smiled at Cain. Cain‚Äôs eyes became glassy. Cain floated to Liam, picked him up and flew out of Addersfield. Liam looked at the town glowing below. Cain waited till they were far enough away and put Liam on the ground. The both looked at each other.¬†

‚ÄúHow far do I have to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúFar Cain. Far enough to where you are off the radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill we ever see each other again?‚Äù¬†

Liam swallowed hard.

‚ÄúWe will find a way, Cain. That‚Äôs what us Vortox‚Äôs do.‚Äù¬†

The boys could hear helicopters getting near. Liam nodded to Cain and Cain shook his head. Cain started to walk away, paused, and looked back. ‚ÄúLove you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù¬†

They hugged for a brief second. Cain‚Äôs eyes began to glass up again. He let go of Liam, took off running and flew in the sky at a speed that was barely visible.

Liam heard footsteps from the opposite end of the room¬† and looked back. It was Geraldson. Geraldson stared at Michael‚Äôs body while a pool of blood began to flow underneath. Liam crawled out of the office. He couldn‚Äôt look at his dad‚Äôs body any longer.¬†

‚ÄúYou are all under arrest‚Äù commanded Officer Gerald. ‚ÄúLiam go outside.‚Äù Liam nodded and began to run out.¬†

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù a voice rang out from the hole in the wall. Mr. Barnliver‚Äôs severed head was tossed through a hole in Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúLiam are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain stay in there!‚Äù¬†

Cain walked out. Glared at Newsome and Shultz who looked visibly frightened. Cain looked down at his dad‚Äôs body. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He grew red.¬†

‚ÄúShoot him, he's the dangerous one!‚Äù Shultz yelled out pointing at Cain.¬†

Cain grabbed her arm and snapped it into two. Ms. Shultz opened her mouth to scream but Cain grabbed a coffee mug sitting on the desk and shoved it down her throat. Muffled screaming came out of Ms. Shultz‚Äôs stuffed throat. Geraldson yelled for Cain but Cain waved his hand and set him flying back twenty feet.¬†

‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE!‚Äù yelled Cain in a deep voice unlike his own. Newsome began to run out of his office but Cain sent a force into his left knee making it unusable. Cain lifted both of them and threw them through the gymnasium doors. Geraldson ran and hit the fire alarm. This was going to get ugly if he didn‚Äôt get the other students out of the building. Cain levitated a foot off the ground and floated into the gymnasium. Officer Riddle ran around the corner and saw Cain floating and two other adults floating. ‚ÄúCain stop or I will have to shoot!‚Äù Cain waived his hand and tipped the bleachers on top of Officer Riddle. Cain screamed which shook the entire school. Officer Geraldson ran outside and directed the other officers to evacuate the other students. Cain ripped off Ms. Shultz‚Äôs limbs from her torso and threw the pieces to the side. It was just him and Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be this way Cain. We can get away from this.‚Äù¬†

Tears flew from Cain‚Äôs face as he roared ‚ÄúYou killed my father!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe world can be yours Cain.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt already is.‚Äù¬†

Cain lifted his hands and set Newsome on fire. Newsome screamed as he became a floating human torch. Cain screamed back as he made the fire hotter and hotter. Then Cain screamed and blew roof off of the gymnasium. Still levitating, Cain levitated down the halls of the school destructing the windows, walls and whatever stood in his way.¬†

Lara ran off and got into her car when Riddle had left. She had heard Geraldson on the radio. Cain was at the school. As she pull up she saw the school imploding from the inside. Students and adults were running away. Running for their lives. Lara parked in the parking lot. The entrance exploded. Cain walked out of the entrance his surroundings were lighting on fire as he passed. Some cops were trying to get in range to take the shot. No.. she couldn‚Äôt lose her baby again. Lara got out of her car.¬†

‚ÄúNo stop! Don‚Äôt shoot please! Cain stop this!‚Äù¬†

Lara ran toward Cain. She promised Cain she would never let anything happen to him again. She couldn‚Äôt sit back and watch him go again.¬†

An officer hiding behind his car held up his pistol and shot. Lara jumped front of Cain with her arms out. She was hit in the chest. Lara took a deep breath in and wheezed. Cain snapped out of his rage and caught his mother before she fell. He looked up and put a force field around him and Lara.¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù¬†

Lara smiled and touched his face. ‚ÄúCain.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no not you too. Why?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain‚Ä¶‚Äù she forced out a laugh and a little blood trickled out of her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúI always wanted to be good mom‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be disappointed in me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI could never be disappointed in you baby. I‚Äôm disappointed in the world and what they‚Äôve put us through.‚Äù She glanced out of the forcefield to see cops shooting at them with no effect.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too mom. Please don‚Äôt leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù Cain was crying watching his mom take her last breath. She began to struggle and Cain held her tighter. Then she was still. Cain laid her down staring at her. He slowly turned to the cop cars raised his hands up and blew every squad car up in front of him. Then he started blowing up the cars behind them.¬†

Geraldson could see the town being destroyed before his very eyes. Explosion after explosion. Bodies flying past him. Everything behind him was on fire. Geraldson broke his promise to always protect Cain and ran the opposite direction as far as he could.¬†

Liam was running but the explosions and fires were catching up fast. Everything was going to be destroyed until the army came in and took Cain out. Liam stopped. Living in a world where Cain died didn‚Äôt feel worth it. Liam ran toward the destruction. Floating ten feet off the ground, he saw his brother blowing up buildings and cars.¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain you have to stop. You‚Äôve taken out the cult. You are hurting innocent people now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey took mom. They took mom Liam.‚Äù¬†

Liam looked down at the ground and tears fell.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end all of them Liam.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúEven me?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDenny?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo not Denny either.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúCain these houses, they belong to people like us. People like Denny. People like Charlotte or Carlie. You have to stop and go. If you don‚Äôt the military is going to take you out.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to be around anymore Liam.‚Äù Liam could feel the fire closing in around him.¬†  
  
‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do it for yourself. Do it for me. We are all we have Liam. I can‚Äôt go on without you.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve done too much Liam.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre still my brother.‚Äù Liam smiled at Cain. Cain‚Äôs eyes became glassy. Cain floated to Liam, picked him up and flew out of Addersfield. Liam looked at the town glowing below. Cain waited till they were far enough away and put Liam on the ground. The both looked at each other.¬†  
  
‚ÄúHow far do I have to go?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúFar Cain. Far enough to where you are off the radar.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWill we ever see each other again?‚Äù¬†  
  
Liam swallowed hard.

‚ÄúWe will find a way, Cain. That‚Äôs what us Vortox‚Äôs do.‚Äù¬†

The boys could hear helicopters getting near. Liam nodded to Cain and Cain shook his head. Cain started to walk away, paused, and looked back. ‚ÄúLove you.‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù¬†  
  
They hugged for a brief second. Cain‚Äôs eyes began to glass up again. He let go of Liam, took off running and flew in the sky at a speed that was barely visible.",1,1751158178.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1ln20g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1ln20g8/42_days_zyn_free/,42 days zyn free,"Hey guys. Just wanted to post here and try to pay it forward after literal years of lurking on this sub, maybe commenting once or twice but never actually giving quitting a real shot. Also, I feel like the majority of posts on here are authored by men and I want to provide some commentary from a female perspective on this sub- though it does seem to be a pretty interchangeable experience regardless. 

42 days ago, my husband and I decided to move forward with fertility treatment (IUI) and I decided to finally quit zyn the day before my IUI. I had been a heavyish zyn user for 2 years (1 x 3mg can per day) after using zyn to quit vaping. I had extreme heath anxiety, physical symptoms (including panic attacks that landed me in the ER a few times) like many of you guys mention here for a long time from nicotine use both vaping and zyning. On top of that, I honestly do think that zyn/nicotine probably impacted my fertility and maybe I would have been able to conceive naturally if not for nic. I don't have any regrets at this point about how things have gone but I will say I wish I pushed myself harder and quit sooner. 
As addicts we are always feeding ourselves excuses as to why we aren't quitting today and how this substance isn't making our lives hell or causing xyz problems even if it's glaringly obvious. 

Fast forward to today, I'm pregnant, and obviously have 0 regrets about not poisoning myself and my future child. I am happy to say that aside from 1-3 times in the first 2 weeks, I have not had a panic attack or any of the physical symptoms that plagued me while on zyn. I know a ton of people complain about things getting worse, about brain fog or worse panic than before-- and I feel for those people and believe that that happens for people. I don't want anyone to see those posts on here and let that be a deterrent from quitting. That might not happen to you. Your symptoms, if you have any, may disappear and just stay gone. Give it a shot. It's worth it. 

I will say it's substantially easier for me to quit and stay nicotine free than it is for anyone who isn't pregnant...it has been so much better knowing that when I have a craving, going back to nicotine is simply not an option due to the increased risk of miscarriage and complication in early pregnancy. That's not to say I don't ever get cravings. The first two weeks were horrific I had them every second especially after eating, after having my morning coffee, while on public transport, you name it. I still think about wanting one maybe once a week but the thought is fleeting. Knowing that I had a real reason to not touch the stuff made it impossible for me to really entertain using or buying it. So even if pregnancy isn't a thing for you, find a reason that feels life or death and remind yourself of that reason to the extent that zyn is no longer a viable option. Sorry I feel like I've been rambling lol and I know that 42 days isn't that long of a time, but it's the longest I've gone without nicotine in my life since the age of 16 (I'm 32 now).

1ln1ugb,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan_travel/comments/1ln1ugb/vegan_in_paris/,Vegan in Paris,"Hi guys! Just been to Paris for a few days and was really surprised how many vegan options are there. I used to struggle there. A lot. So just wanted to share a few places I like if you are traveling there and looking for some places.

1. Le Potager de Marais. It's very popular on the Happy Cow and most nights it's fully booked, so better have a reservation in advance. It's very simple place with the traditional French dishes but-make-it-vegan. Like onion soup! It's always a first choice for me. Fully vegan.
2. Le Potager du Charlotte. There's 2 of them actually. I've been to the one closer to Montmartre twice. Nice place. Fully vegan.
3. Maslow. The location is superb. Close to the Pont Neuf and Le Samaritaine. It's a very popular among parisians bar with delicious vegetarian food. Cauliflower wings were so good, we had to order second round! We didn't have a reservation, so had to wait for 15minutes for a table. But it was worth it.
4. Daimant. There are 2 of them. We've been to the St Honore one. Good location, 10min from Louvre. Esthetically it's very Parisian, with pleated chairs. It's fully plant-based. The dishes are unusual, there's also a vegan caviar which I highly recommend. Also, as I love chocolate, they have the best chocolate mousse by far. They suggest you take 5-6 different plates for 2 to share. I would say - yes, but that should include a dessert.
5. Les Creatures. It's a vegetarian bar on top of Galeries Lafayette. The views are INSANE! The food is really good. The place is extremely busy, and it can take a minute to get your food or drinks. But definitely worth visiting.

There's also a restaurant I missed as it was closed on Sunday- 42 Degrees. But it looks very promising so I'll leave it for the next time.

I had been in Paris quite a few times and vegan food gets better and better. There's still long way to go as Rive Gauche has basically no options (

Almost forgot. There's Wild and the Moon. They are coffee shop style places with healthy vegan foods. They won't let you get hangry.

1ln1tr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln1tr5/genuinely_need_some_help_i_am_going_crazy/,Genuinely need some help :( I am going crazy,"It‚Äôs been almost 2 months since we broke up. I was the one who ended it ‚Äî not because I stopped loving her, but because I felt emotionally drained and unseen. My needs weren‚Äôt being met. She was inconsistent, avoided emotional closeness, and I constantly felt uncertain about where we stood. I used to be patient, calm, and grounded ‚Äî but over time I became reactive and emotionally anxious because I felt like I was the only one fighting for the relationship.

We were long-distance, but I showed up ‚Äî planned trips, made time, put effort into thoughtful gestures. We shared intimacy that felt deep to me ‚Äî emotionally and physically. But behind the surface, there was always a layer of emotional distance from her that I could never quite get through.

Early in the relationship, I found out she was still talking to her ex ‚Äî something she never disclosed, and something I stumbled on by accident. I even discovered she still had intimate videos from that past relationship, which broke my heart. That, combined with her texting another guy and trying to go on a date after we became exclusive, really shattered the trust. She claimed she didn‚Äôt follow through, but it didn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî I felt betrayed. I forgave her, but I couldn‚Äôt forget.

After I forgave her and she asked me to ask her to be my girlfriend, she looked genuinely happy. For a while, it felt like she really loved me deeply. She took me to meet all her close friends, took me to meet her family, stayed with them many times, went out to dinner with them etc. When i was with her at her place i used to check her iPad because of trust issues (i know i was wrong her) and she found out and that broke her trust as well we communicated and she forgave me. The main issue was every month, she would emotionally distance herself for 7‚Äì10 days ‚Äî completely shut down, become cold, and unreachable. It wrecked me every time. I‚Äôd express how it made me feel, how it reopened my fears, and begged her not to pull away again.. But that cycle repeated ‚Äî and asking her every time not to disappear drained her too. We were both emotionally exhausted, trying to keep something alive while we bled out.

After the breakup, I blocked her from everything except TikTok.  The next day, she texted me there saying she ‚Äúwanted to talk,‚Äù but didn‚Äôt open up when I called (same old avoidance and pulling away). Then she went back to talking to old flings ‚Äî within one week. The next week i travelled to her city for work and she found out i was there through mutuals and she texted me ‚Äúi miss you being here, cant change it, just saying and asked me if we could grab coffee but i didn‚Äôt agree to it because it took her one week to reach out to old fling. A month later, she was back on dating apps and even followed the same guy who had caused the original trust issues when we were exclusive. That was the final punch but it made me laugh because that guy didn‚Äôt follow her back and that she is trying to fill the void with anyone and everyone. 

The last few days have been brutal. I thought I was doing okay, but I stumbled on our backed-up photos in Google ‚Äî videos of her calling me ‚Äúbaby,‚Äù of her smiling, laughing in bed, cooking together, going on hikes. Everything came flooding back. And while I‚Äôm crying in bed, she‚Äôs recently started posting TikTok videos and she looks happy, looking like nothing happened.

We had real moments. I helped her process trauma. I held space for her. I was patient, loving, and gave her all of me. But it felt like she couldn‚Äôt give me the same in return ‚Äî or wouldn‚Äôt. And now, she‚Äôs moved on like I was just a pitstop in her story. I‚Äôm not even angry at her anymore ‚Äî I just feel disposable.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of delayed grief, even when you were the one who ended it? I still love her, but I know I couldn‚Äôt stay in a relationship where I didn‚Äôt feel emotionally safe. I‚Äôm trying to move on, but the weight of it all still sits heavy on my chest.",1,1751157570.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Any one of those long stretching summer days that seem to go on until they're lost in the damp rot of autumn.

You do weird things after getting fired. I quickly got lost into my childhood routine, jogging by the local canal's waterside every day in the warm, silent twilight hour just before night.

The same winding path every day from my parent's house. Number 19.

First came the long stone stretch, around a mile of worn-out pathway, jagged and rough rocks jutting out at every unfortunate opportunity.

To my left, a long wire fence, old boats scattered around the canal, dilapidated. One in every five or so would still have a little yellow light shining from the window, and smoke from it's whistle, it's owners entering the soft death spiral of retirement. To my right a new housing project was being built, the old blackberry bushes murdered to make way for a haze of half-built buildings, cranes and slowly rotting heavy machinery.

Paved stone gave way to dispersed gravel. Buildings and machinery fleeing as quickly as they invaded, displaced by bushes of nettles, trees and what remains of the English wilds. A speck of nature in the lens of \*\*Industry\*\*.

The gravel too soon stopped, and all that remained was a path of the variety poets and liars call less travelled by.

In reality, the council ran out of money and didn't bother with the rest.

Past the gravel, all of a sudden your sides are flanked by willows and oaks, branches on either side winding and weaving themselves into 8ft tall hallways. Rather than canal boats and metal fences, the canal lifts, the corners smudge. The roots of the trees poke out into the water. Just past the trees on the left, a sharp incline down into reeds and grass. Once in a while a foolhardy tree decided to be sowed into it's side, it's roots regretting the decision wholeheartedly as it quietly drowned into the canal.

It's there that the  plastic caught my eye. It was sticking out of the mud, at the side of the bank. Unmistakable between the shit coloured water, shit caked mud, and shit covered grass.

I don't even remember why I picked it up. It was the biggest mistake of my life.

Sorry. I'm still bitter. I miss you.

This place is pretty in it's own way I suppose. I was here half my childhood, so that thin foil smudged off a long time ago. I spent so much of my life here trying to escape it, I guess I never appreciated it's twisted form of prettiness.

There is beauty here; Lonely empty beauty, even in the town.

The shops are mostly closed down. The 'temporary' concrete from the 50s that constituted a high-street rotting away beneath layers of cracks, bakeries twisted into gambling bookies, the coffee shops and newsagents melted into rows of grotesque neon purple vape & american sweets shops.

There's no rolling hills to look out on, even when you get out of the town it's just fields of inedible rapeseed, lifeless canals in which no fish dare tread and dispersed bits of wood & nature clinging to life against the encroaching developments.

It's strange, but I used to feel a stranger within that nature, more so than the local town. Eastern Europe is filled with massive woods, all encompassing, places that you could lose yourself in. Filled with life and bird-song. Beautiful, stretching forests filled with a plethora of wildlife, rarely seen but ever present, a calming panopticon of life.

It's not like Britain has wild bears hiding in the trees. Snakes are few and far between, and mostly harmless. Any monster left in England long ago had put on a tie, shaved and started working as an estate agent (the final resting place of all evil).

Yet slowly, a dread comes over you when you approach a deeper section of wood here, one I haven't felt in any other country. It's this feeling in the back of your head that you can't escape, a question that noisessly forms towards the bare wood, clinging to wilderness against the denseness of development.

\*Why are you still here?\*

And sometimes, through the wind, the whistles and the straining of the branches - I sometimes used to think that I could hear a word uttered in the rustle of the leaves.

Interloper.

\---

I remember there was an old artist we saw once in a museum. You were telling me about some ugly sculpture as we walked past. Do you remember?

You stopped me, asked why I wasn't listening. Said something snide about how I do it all the time. Scatter-brained.

But I remember the painting. Do you remember that painting?

It was this beautiful still life. Ripening fruit, and flowering buds. Perfect soft lights and shadows fell on each individual petal, it's creators obsessive attention shining through. You said you've seen a thousand of them before. You laughed at the right half of the canvas, a howler monkey on the table tearing his sharpened teeth against a ripening fruit, red juice staining his hungry face.

We kept walking. I didn't talk to you about it. I don't know why.

But below the ripe fruit bowl, and in the vase of flowering roses, something caught my eye.

In the same vibrant shades and hues, with the same gorgeous detail lay dead and rotting exotic birds.

The monkey wasn't biting into a fruit.

Still beautiful in a way; bright coats of amber and lilac, still and rotting, small dots of \*\*Flies\*\* circling carcasses. This town feels like that painting, that same cruel beauty.

The mixture of life, death and wilderness fighting for the same space on the canvas.

\---

I don't remember what made me pick it up or walk through the swarms of summer Flies, squelching in the soft dirt of the canal, it was half buried in the silty mud, it's casing caked with soil and dirt.

I don't particularly love old tat, but there was something so nostalgic about seeing the thing.

Submerged in that dirt was an old Nokia 3310.

I had one in school. My parents struggled to afford anything more expensive, but I cherished that thing like it was pure gold.  Even as the other kids started to get the first iPhone, I held that thing for dear life, you couldn't do much apart from play snake and text, but those things were indestructible.

Apart from being covered in a layer of silt and dirt, it looked... It was like it had come from the Factory brand new, no scratches, buttons all there. After wiping it clean with a nearby leaf, It looked like it did two decades ago. I took it into my hands then, climbing back up the side of the canal.

I've been running on that path every single evening, I never put much thought into it, just jogged.

The bird song, the crickets, the buzzing of summer Flies, the buzzing of summer Flies. The wind rustling through the leaves.

All things I've become used to.

But as soon as I got back up that path, back in the gentle nature of that path - it stopped.

All sound ceased.

It was instant. Like pausing an orchestra in the middle of a chord. My ears filled with silence, the woods themselves hushed and muted. I can't explain it, but there's a sort of terrible dread that comes through, starts through your heart and infects itself, rushing to your bones, then your head. The air suddenly felt different, hollow. It was the second before thunder, the cloying, clinging static permeating breath with empty air.

It's primal. My bones filled with the fear of silence. I looked towards the wood.

Darkness enveloped the arches of the trees, the branches jutted out and formed indescribable shapes in the darkness, mixing with the shadows to form terrible still creations on the ground ahead of me.

The twilight was creeping away, the only illumination a tiny slither of moonlight from the cloud cover, turning the horrid shadows into disgusting geometric puppets, contorting and moving like swarms, united by the direction of the light.

That's what made me see it. That's what made me realize something was wrong.

The moon was behind me. No other lights illuminated the patch of wood.

So why, in that twilight hour, why were those beasts in the shadows of the branches; moving towards me?

I turned and ran.

I didn't dare to look back, the eyes of the woods felt like Schrodinger's parable, death to the observer, fear and hatred was behind me and the lights of the houses my only clinging reality. Each branch felt like it was coiling it's way round my body, the bushes of nettles felt like they lunged at me as I ran, my arms stung with it's sparking shocks.

Something caused me to trip.

The rough gravel of the path burning my palm with it's sharp skin. The noises came back like lightning, a roaring, breaking wind within my ears as I grasped, my knees shaved and bleeding, my hands stinging, tiny shards of gravel lodged within my palm, mixing with the nettles poison to create an almost calming, numbing pain. I barely got up as I ran again, the lights of houses & canal boats ahead ever more distant.

I was screaming from the pain and the wind, my mind filled with nothing but the sense to run. I felt like a child, turning off the light and rushing into my bed, unknown horror right behind me, grasping at my shoulder, ready to pull me into the silent darkness.

I saw a figure then, in front of me, emerging from a winding path. Tall and.. reflective, bright yellow and torchlight within my blurry eyes. I heard a bark. I saw the tug of a leash.

It was a dogwalker.

He looked at me, bewildered. ""You okay lad?"" A rough, familiar English tone. I protected my eyes from his torch light until I was adjusted to the soft yellow hues. He placed it down.

He was maybe 50/60 years of age? People age quick in this town. His back slightly hunched, his face slightly saggy yet kind, he had a roundness of the frame that was clear over his bright his-vis jacket, cheap and scratched.

He was one of those old local men who would've looked suited within any generation. Any time. His walking stick rapped gently against the gravel as his dog, a small yapping creature of undisclosed background bobbed around him in circles, jitty and barking.

He was smiling when he saw me, a polite, automatic smile. There was no menace, no monster behind him. I looked at him, then looked behind me. My normal path. The normal woods, the bushes unkept but stationary.

I spoke. I tried to explain.

I forgot about my accent. I've been in England for so long, I've absorbed the language, but my accent won't die, no matter the coaching, the lessons, no matter how hard I try.

His smile dropped, just slightly. He shifted his weight onto his back foot defensively. I remember how his entire demeanour changed. How his eyes shifted, his nose sneering. His voice became rough, slow, as if talking to a child.  The kindness of his face became a kind of sneering judgment.

""Best you get home mate."" he spoke with a slight venom behind his tongue. His torch shifted back on me, I could feel it inspecting my knees, my arms. He tutted.

""You people, it's bad enough you're taking the work from our good local lads, but you take god knows what and bother us here now too?  Best you be getting home, don't want to get lost round these parts. ""

I'd usually speak out, say something. It felt like he was spewing out something he'd been preparing for years. Yet I couldn't help but smile slightly, stifling back a laugh.

I was almost happy to see him. Happy to feel prejudice rather than terror.

I muttered a sorry and walked back home.

I was back at the fencing and housing soon. I looked back every few minutes, trying to see any sign of what caused that initial terror.

I only saw him. And he was watching me.

I swear every time I turned around he'd be staring. I couldn't help but notice that his dog was still, staring intently towards the woods.

When I made it inside, past the pain of the nettles and the gravel, I reached into my pocket for the Nokia. It stung against my bleeding hand, but it made me feel sane. As If I hadn't imagined what had happened to me.

As I washed my hands, carefully picking out each piece of stinging gravel, the phone began to turn on. I hadn't noticed until the familiar nokia tone rang through the bathroom. I almost jumped when the familiar, loud and shrill beeping notification came through.

Why tariffs? Because these tariffs are damaging small businesses in particular, disrupting supply chains and business planning, and they threaten much more harm in the form of higher prices and inflation. The release of tariff news is enabling outrageous stock market manipulation. There is no coherent plan in evidence, other than chaotic disruption. Everyone will be affected if the pointless Tariff Wars continue.

They have also been promoted on the false premise that the tariffed country pays the tariffs. Nope, economists agree that tariffs are a tax that is ultimately paid by the citizens of the country imposing the tariff.

Even if you‚Äôve never set foot in the Big Apple, you‚Äôve probably seen them. They feature in many films and TV series set in the city: the blue cardboard cups for coffee-to-go with a Greek-inspired design.

*Processing img 4crtxq46gr9f1...*

The coffee cup (also known as the Anthora cup) was created in 1963 by the Sherri Cup Company in Connecticut, specifically to appeal to the patrons of diners, delis and coffee shops in New York City, many of whom were Greek. By introducing Greek-themed cups and appealing to Greek patriotism and pride, Sherri Cup hoped to revive the company‚Äôs flagging sales.

Tribute to Greek culture Design of the Anthora cup Design of the Anthora cup Leslie Buck, a Czech immigrant and Holocaust survivor who worked at Sherri Cup as a sales manager and then became the company's marketing director, came up with the idea for the Greek cup. Despite not having any formal art training, Buck created the design from scratch. But not before doing some in-depth research into Greek culture. The result was a design that paid homage to Greece. The cup's blue and white colors symbolize the Greek flag. The centerpiece of the design is the motto 'We are happy to serve you'

‚Ä¶above three steaming cups of coffee, the gold-colored letters are executed in a Greek style. A meander pattern decorates the edges of the cup, on which two Greek urns (amphora) are also depicted. The coffee cup also owes its name to this amphora; with his Eastern European accent, Leslie Buck would have pronounced the word as ‚Äúanthora‚Äù.

500 million cups Buck‚Äôs design was an instant success. The popularity of the blue coffee cup lasted for decades. In the 1990s, Sherri Cup sold hundreds of millions of cups a year. In 1994, 500 million cups were sold, but after Sherri Cup was acquired by the Solo Cup Company, sales quickly went downhill.

According to the New York Times, this was partly due to the arrival of Starbucks in New York that same year. As a result, more and more traditional coffee shops disappeared or were replaced by a branch of the trendy coffee chain. In 2005, Sherri Cup saw sales drop to 200 million and in 2012, production of the famous New York coffee cup came to an end. Nevertheless, the Anthora never disappeared from the streets of New York.

Iconic The Anthora Cup in Mad Men The Anthora Cup in Mad Men In many films and TV series set in New York (for example Wolf of Wall Street, Men in Black, NYPD Blue, Mad Men and Law & Order ) the characters drink coffee from the blue cup that has become as iconic as the yellow taxis on the streets of the eternally awake city. The New York Times included the Greek coffee cup on its list of the 50 objects that embody the history of New York. The Museum of Modern Art began selling a ceramic version of the coffee cup. In December 2015, the company Dart Container revived the Anthora and was granted a license to make wallets, cufflinks and watches with the famous design.

And Leslie Buck? He never received any royalties for his design, but as a salesman he profited greatly from the popularity of his brainchild. When he retired in 1992, Sherri Cup made him 10,000 special cups with the words

'It was our pleasure to serve you'.

1ln1kzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1ln1kzr/manager_wants_me_to_tell_him_when_other_employees/,"Manager wants me to tell him when other employees are messing with me, but I'm not sure what counts","Hope the title makes sense. This situation is a great combo of stressful, petty, and stupid. Questions at the bottom if the context is too long- I'm trying to include everything relevant.

Context:

I work as a prep cook for the bar at a bougie hotel in a big city. I have two coworkers, Alice and Josephine. Alice and I worked together at another job for nine months and I got her the job here because we had always gotten along well and she was a reliable worker. I work with Alice during the day and Josephine comes in an hour before the end of our day to start the night shift.

We have a list of things we need to make every day and it's our responsibility to split up the work between ourselves fairly. I would usually get in before Alice and wind up making the list (meaning seeing what we needed to make based on the par sheet given to us by management) and then when Alice got in I would ask how she wanted to split it up. We used to communicate about it well at first and would get everything done. Over the last 4-6 weeks she went from being normal, to only saying she didn't care how we split things up, to completely refusing to acknowledge I said anything to her. She would slam things down in the prep area aggressively, throw things at the wall, things like that. We share the prep area with other people who also looked uncomfortable with her so I know it wasn't just me overreacting. She also started coming in 30-90 minutes late (with coffee) and leaving at least 30 minutes early. About three weeks ago she angrily wrote down her own division of labor and said she was splitting things up evenly because she was tired of sucking dick. She called out the next day and I sent her a text saying she should just do what she felt was her fair half and I would do the rest- she never responded. 

Last week Josephine sent me an aggressive text at 6:30 AM about how I'm creating too much waste (when the restaurant has events she crosses out the amount of requested items and gives them the amount they think they should have- I make the amount requested by management), lots of all caps sentences, etc. I went in to work later and Alice kept throwing metal stuff at the wall, dropping heavy things next to my head, you get the idea. Josephine came in and they started chatting with each other, leaving me to do all the work. They made it extremely theatrically obvious they were trying to gossip about me, and I got fed up and left 20 minutes early. I texted them saying I was sick of their rudeness and they should just talk to me if there was a problem. Josephine sent me back an eight paragraph response of everything she hates about me. I showed my manager and he said he'd deal with it. The next day Alice was coming in to work with me. I texted her a picture of the prep list and asked her to tell me verbally if she didn't like it instead of slamming things. She sent me a multi paragraph text of everything she hates about me, accusing me of taking advantage of her time and labor, various things that the camera we work right under would prove aren't true, and said she had been waiting for me to figure out that she and Josephine had been icing me out because they don't like me. That day she showed up an hour late and left half an hour early without finishing the task list. I told my manager things had also gone south with Alice and he told me to stop engaging with her and let him deal with it.

My manager and the big boss met with each of us individually. I told them my side of the story and they said Alice had said I was being overly emotional and passive aggressive, but nothing about me being lazy or anything from the texts. After the meeting Alice basically immediately hid a tool I needed to do a job while I was in the middle of it. When she left the prep area I found where she had hidden it and finished the job. She came back and immediately got on her phone, then stared angrily at the wall while sighing heavily waiting for me to finish with the tool. They met with Josephine later, then the three of us. In our three person meeting they basically asked us if we were willing to start from a clean slate and asked if anyone had anything else they wanted to say. I said I was willing to make a fresh start. Josephine just grunted and Alice wouldn't say anything or make eye contact.

My manager told me to tell him as soon as anything else happened with Josephine or Alice. 



My questions:

What counts as worth contacting my manager? I know their admission that they're intentionally fucking with me isn't actionable because it wasn't on a company platform, but it does have to inform how I interpret their actions. If Alice hides things from me while my back is turned, or goes out of her way to drop things harder than she needs to but in the realm of plausible deniability, do I tell him? If I just was miserable all day working with her, is it wasting his time to tell him that? He really likes me and told me to consider him both a resource regardless of where our careers take us, and a friend. I don't want to complain about nothing, but I also don't want to get bullied out of the job.

I had a rough time as a kid (diagnosed with PTSD which means the unpredictable loud sounds and physical aggression make my heart rate go way up and my hands shake, I've been spending whole days like that for the last month) and I've been working hard on my interpersonal skills, but there are obviously a lot of giant gaps. Is there like a resource where I can read about what's normal at work and what's reportable? If it's just my subjective opinion that Alice is pitching a fit to prove a point, do I tell him that?

Before all this shit started with Alice, this was the best job I'd ever had. I don't have beef with anyone in the entire hotel except apparently Josephine and Alice, but every manager and all the bartenders like me. Am I going to jeopardize that if I complain too much to my manager? This whole thing has me so messed up.

Thanks to anyone who made it to the end. ",1,1751156809.0,askmanagers,0,1.0,False

* Don't study anywhere else. I am going to go against the grain, I don't think going to a coffee shop or a park or whatever is good for studying. You are actually just procrastinating. You are bullsh*ting yourself. Are you really going to spend your best hours getting ready to go out and study instead of studying?
* Study in the morning about 30 minutes after you wake up. Your brain is fresh.
* don't shower. Nope. Don't put your energy into that. Shower after studying. If you can cold shower, this would be okay. I think maybe cold showers would wake you up and focus you. I have done that a time or two and it didn't seem to have the impact a hot shower does on me. But a hot shower will make me light headed a bit. It is worthless. I don't want to lose all my morning mojo.
* Shower at night before bed or after you are done studying instead.
* Do not talk out loud when studying. Do not. They will interrupt you and tell you not to.
* Schedule your LSAT during the period you normally study.
* Do not use music.
* Get a white noise machine.
* Put it outside of the room you are studying in.
* Turn it on full blast to muffle sounds.
* Tell people to be quiet. Be firm.
* Put in a pair of earplugs. (You won't be able to use them on test day, so stop before then to get used to not having them. But for now, focus is number one.)
* Install a Chrome extension that locks you out of going to websites like Reddit for 4 hours in the morning or your preferred study time. I use StayFocused.
* Drill. Look at your wrong answer.
* If using 7sage, build question sets with the types of questions you get wrong the most.
* Drill only those questions after you have figured out your weak areas.
* Go through ALL right and wrong answers and make sure you got them right for the correct reason or to understand why you got them wrong.
* Try not to do a full test right out of the gate in the morning every single day.
* Instead, do about 10 questions, then review.
* The best reviews are usually your first 10 in the morning. This helps you process where your thinking was wrong.
* Drink water when you wake up.
* Don't eat breakfast. (Your brain works better on an empty stomach. Eat whenever you have to, but in the morning, you want that clear mind feeling before you eat a big breakfast.)
* Eat a big dinner before bed if you need to so you aren't as hungry in the morning.
* Eat a lot of fat and things that take a while to digest.
* When you do eat your breakfast stick to medium to low carb. Or eat carbs like potatoes and butter. Don't eat a bunch of sugary things that will make your brain mush or give you an insulin crash.
* Fight day dreaming. Anytime you start daydream, stop. Refuse to participate. Daydreaming is really unhealthy for me, so I had to stop myself whenever I start to daydream. It's like my brain is getting endorphins from made up daydreams instead of real life. I have to tell myself I am focusing on my real life.

These are my general study tips and I have used them for years to annihilate tests. I CLEP'd out of many tests and took many test out courses at my college that offered them.

1ln1j44,https://i.redd.it/ne8d9bbsfr9f1.jpeg,I want to know what this sub thinks of Dr. Alan Shaw's 114 page essay on Mulholland Drive...,"First of all here is the link to his 2004 essay (contains spoilers obviously): [Analysis ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkVf7sEHCAmkV_zMmd6nW8rnw5cyxZMq/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=106473135638994577983&rtpof=true&sd=true)

I have to say, I think he really nailed down the core of the movie, I really do. Granted he does tend to overanalyze certain scenes and overcomplicate some of his explanations, especially in the scene to scene portion, I personally think he got the core plot & the timeline of events SPOT ON.

I write quite a bit of theories too, and I can totally understand the importance of color symbolisms, every single object in the frame having some meaning, nothing being random, which this essay brilliantly delves into, but I can see people dismiss his points as being a stretch. Being a theorist myself, I'd wanna side with shaw & also the fact that Mulholland drive was supposed to be a TV show, so it doesn't surprise me that it has as much symbolic depth, subplots & layers as a TV show should have.

Yes, it's a david lynch film and there could be room for multiple Interpretations of the different scenes itself but the timeline... this essay has it spot on. Lynch has dropped some clues to solve it atleast the closest to the definitive way, and I personally feel the 3rd clue with *""Notice the robe, the ashtray, the coffee cup.
""* is the most yielding out of the 10 clues. That one clue, emphasized by Lynch, PROVES the order of the story and how even the ""reality"" portion of the film is a set of non-linear flashbacks, the order of which Dr. Shaw has brilliantly broken down

I tried to search on this sub on what people think of the essay and I was surprised to see some dismiss the core of the theory as being wrong ie. the abuse Diane suffered from her family/grandfather being the primary cause for all her self-loathing. I feel like apart from the audition scene itself, the painting of ""Beatrice Cenci"" at betty's house, another woman who was a victim of incest, being such a prominent presence in betty's house is such a big reveal that incest is a big part of our story. (Refer my attached image)

I hope hope who haven't heard about the essay,, know about the essay's existence through this post and do pick it up to read it, because it's truly brilliant. For those who have read it, What do you think of the essay?",3,1751156648.0,davidlynch,0,1.0,False

Everyone always says that when you die, there is a bright light at the end of a long dark tunnel, beckoning you towards it. You used to wonder what would await you once you reached it, and today you found out. You only remember the crash, then the tunnel, and finally - your house. You can only see a bright light outside, and something feels off. Not only that, someone is in the house with you, and they claim to be your spouse! Will you take the deal they are proposing?

(Scene description: Listener woke up in his living room. Speaker approaches him from behind. Only the inside of the house exists, outside only bright sunlight is visible.)



\[cordial\] (clearing her throat) **Excuse me! Behind you.** (chuckle)



(Listener turns around cursing)



‚Ä¶



\[cordial\] **Oh my, no one told me you had such a dirty mouth!** ***Language!*** **Do not be alarmed please, this whole process will go** ***much*** **more smoothly if you remain calm. N-No, don‚Äôt back away from me! I don‚Äôt mean to sound too threatening, but there is, quite literally,** ***no*** **place for you to escape to. Not on** ***this*** **plane of existence, anyway.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[cordial\] **Why yes, this** ***does*** **look like your house, but rest assured that it is not. I will explain in a moment, my dear husband.**¬†



**‚Ä¶**



\[cordial\] **You never** ***did*** **marry, that is true, I am but a part of the‚Ä¶** ***‚Äúpackage‚Äù*****, so to speak. Also, I am not crazy, no more than anyone else down here anyway. Alright, now that we‚Äôve cleared that up, how about you try to calm down a bit? I understand that your memory is still a bit foggy, but you were in a car accident just moments ago. We recognize that this transition is not only traumatic but also hard to digest, so why don‚Äôt you sit down for- and he‚Äôs running away.** (sigh)



(SFX: running steps, door opening then closing, as Listener runs out of the house only to be right back in his living room.)



‚Ä¶



\[slightly annoyed\] **Welcome back, darling. Now that you tried to run outside only to end up back in your living room, you** ***must*** **understand that you‚Äôve got nowhere to run. I ask you to refrain from further escape attempts, as they are not only futile but also quite tiresome. Then again, if you prefer, I am** ***quite*** **capable of restraining you. So which is it? Sit down on your couch or be chained to the wall?**



(SFX: Listener walking to the couch, then sitting down.)



\[condescending, sickly sweet\] **There we go, my, such a good boy you are!** (clearing her throat)

\[cordial\] **I‚Ä¶ beg your pardon. You see, up until recently I had a very** ***different‚Ä¶*** **occupation. Let‚Äôs get to the paperwork then, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to clear up any misunderstandings about your current situation. I‚Äôll sit down with you for now.**



(SFX: Speaker walking to the couch, then sitting down next to Listener.)



\[amused\] **Of course I‚Äôm sitting close to you, after all, I‚Äôm your loving wife!** **The way you‚Äôre looking at me though‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt you want a kiss?** (giggle) **But maybe we should indeed start with the explanations now.**¬†

\[cordial\] **You, sir, are** ***dead.*** **Just moments ago you had a car accident resulting in your sudden and quite violent demise. I understand that this is a lot to take in, but maybe it helps you to know that none of the other car‚Äôs inhabitants were seriously injured. They will continue to live their lives, until they meet their own end at a later date. Please take your time processing this information.**



(very short pause.)



\[upbeat\] **Alrighty then, now that all of that business is well and settled, let‚Äôs move things along shall we? No? Do you need more time? Well, honestly I don‚Äôt really have any for your flimsy human emotions, so we‚Äôre moving on. If you would take a look at this document please‚Ä¶**



(SFX: Paper moving, as Speaker hands Listener a contract.)



‚Ä¶



\[upbeat\] **Indeed, it is a contract of sorts. Now, as I already said before, you‚Äôre dead, sweetheart. That is** ***not*** **the end of the bad news however, because after your death you were‚Ä¶ sent to** ***hell.***¬†



**‚Ä¶**



\[soothing\] **Yes, yes, I know what people say about hell up there, but try not to think about all those rumors for now. What we are about to discuss might save you from the fire and brimstone yet.**¬†

\[cordial\] **You see, hell is a very‚Ä¶** ***personal*** **affair for humans. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs not like everyone gets their** ***own*** **hell or something, more like we separate people by sins and then tweak the individual punishments to fit the person best. As for** ***you*****, well‚Ä¶ for now, we put you into a familiar surrounding. Namely, your house back on earth.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[cordial\] **Indeed, this is but a simulacrum of the world you‚Äôve known before. Nothing exists outside these walls, and until we have concluded our business I** ***guarantee*** **that you will not be hurt in any way, be that through decapitation, disembowelment, burning, impalement, blunt force trauma, penetrating force trauma, psychological trauma or any other way I can think of.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **Oh please, let‚Äôs not think about what happens afterwards for now, agreed? Good. Let‚Äôs get to business then.** (giggle)

\[cordial\] **As I explained, you are bound for eternal torment in hell. However, the severity of one‚Äôs misdeeds is** ***always*** **taken into account when deciding on a form of punishment for the sinner. After all, someone like a** ***serial killer*** **would receive more severe torture than say, someone who stole from a church‚Äôs offering basket** ***once.*** **Therefore, we need to use more mild punishments for those who are‚Ä¶** ***low*** **grade offenders, so to speak. Such as yourself.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[furious\] **Animal abusers?! All the way down, to the fucking deepest, darkest pit you can imagine! We rip them apart, mash their pitiful, shriveled, worthless souls back together, only to grind them up again in an endless cyclone of pain! Everyday they wish for the sweet, soothing embrace of unending oblivion, as even the horrific prospect of absolute non-existence seems like the loving embrace of an angel to them!** (heavy panting, followed by clearing her throat)

\[embarrassed\] **I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ sorry, I might‚Äôve exaggerated a bit. It‚Äôs a** ***personal*** **matter for me. Please, ignore my outburst.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **Well, I** ***do*** **have access to parts of your records, but I am unable to say what specific misdeeds have resulted in your fate.**¬†

\[almost whispered\] **I‚Äôm not supposed to say this, but the guys who wrote the rules had some pretty weird issues with specific kinds of people, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much. You‚Äôre probably still a decent person.** (chuckle)

  


**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **Of course I think so, honey! I wouldn‚Äôt have married you otherwise!** (giggle) **Excuse me, I couldn‚Äôt resist.**

\[cordial\] **Normally, we would have just sent you to one of the higher levels to torment you - higher meaning less bad in this case - but we keep running into the same type of problem. It used to be that the mere presence of demons and the like rattling their pitchforks against their cage would make a halfway decent person go crazy with fear.** ***Nowadays*** **though we recognize that we must innovate to keep up with our modern audience. That‚Äôs where** ***you*** **come in, my dear husband! Let me explain.**¬†



(SFX: pages being turned, as Speaker flips through a document.)



\[cordial\] ***There*** **we are. See? It says here you are‚Ä¶ introverted, you have trouble fitting in with societal norms, are unable and** ***unwilling*** **to understand and or adapt to basic social etiquette, disturbed by interacting with other humans in a cordial or professional setting, et cetera. In other words, you see yourself as something of a social outcast, and while the reason for this is not included in this document, it is not really important for our discussion right now. You see, an increasing number of humans show‚Ä¶** ***peculiarities*** **similar to yours. As such, they get accustomed to the more mild punishments we have in store for them and start treating the torture like some kind of day job, one recently even stating and I quote: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked in customer service from nine to five for fourteen years, getting whipped three times a day is a nice change of pace.‚Äù**



**‚Ä¶**



\[happy\] ***Exactly,*** **darling! You‚Äôre** ***such*** **a quick learner! We can‚Äôt have that, we need ways to torture humans effectively even on the less...** ***invasive*** **levels. To facilitate this it was decided that we should run a program of sorts. The idea is to take new souls that were sent to hell for** ***minor*** **offenses and offer them a simple deal: one year of experimental torture, in exchange for a chance to move up to heaven! Isn‚Äôt it great?**



**‚Ä¶**



\[annoyed\] (frustrated sigh) **Seriously what‚Äôs going** ***on*** **up there? Why is every single one of you humans always asking about the fine print? I‚Äôm offering you a way to get out of** ***hell,*** **why are you so distrusting of my words? It‚Äôs like all of you are scamming each other on a daily basis and now you‚Äôre hyper aware of the possibility of someone tricking you. But fine, have it your way. It‚Äôs not a** ***catch*** **so to speak, it‚Äôs more like‚Ä¶ a** ***job*****.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **No, no you don‚Äôt need to torture anyone yourself. You see, the things we would like to try on you are experimental torture methods, as I said before. The idea is that we will apply these methods to you and then get feedback about the process and severity of your torment. The concept of social ineptitude is** ***very*** **foreign to us demons, so we need some actual feedback to properly understand how much you hate what is happening. Also, think about your fellow sinners: we don‚Äôt like to punish humans unnecessarily hard, we pride ourselves on selecting** ***appropriate*** **measures to torment someone. You would help us** ***and*** **them with this.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[cordial\] **Again, this will go on for one year only. You will‚Ä¶** ***‚Äúlive‚Äù*****‚Ä¶ here, with food and the ability to sleep, and I or another representative will collect you ever so often for an experiment. A small amount of time when you compare it to an eternity of torture, don‚Äôt you think? Afterwards we will bring you to an envoy of heaven and they will hear what you have to say in defense of your sins, as well as give you a chance to apologize sincerely. If they decide to accept your apology - which they** ***do*** **most of the time, because they are major softies - you will then be granted entrance to heaven, with all the amenities that come with it. So, what do you say?**



**‚Ä¶**



\[happy\] **Great! So glad we are in agreement, please sign your full name on the dotted line, right under the clause that waives** ***all*** **our responsibility concerning lasting psychological damage. Thaaank you! Oh, we‚Äôre gonna have a** ***lot*** **of fun, I promise!** (giggle)



‚Ä¶



\[teasing\] **Oh, right, the husband-thing! Well it does say in your file that you are‚Ä¶ afraid of close human contact, especially in a romantic setting. I just decided to get into my role as your loving, caring, touch-starved wife a little bit ahead of time, darling! Guess what I‚Äôve planned for your first** ***night*** **down here? Maybe you‚Äôd like a little‚Ä¶** ***teaser?*** (excited giggle)



‚Ä¶



\[cordial\] **S-Sorry, that‚Äôs that former job getting to me again. Just know that during your stay here I will take the role of your wife, that is also part of the deal. You‚Äôll understand soon, don‚Äôt worry. Let‚Äôs start right now so you can get an idea of what is waiting for you. In the beginning I will present scenarios to you, the actual torture starts tomorrow. Alright then‚Ä¶**



(SFX: Flipping through pages)



\[reading\] **No‚Ä¶. not that one‚Ä¶ not this one‚Ä¶** ***that*** **one is for a rainy day‚Ä¶ ah!**¬†

\[upbeat\] **Perfect, test number one: You‚Äôre sitting at home and your wife - hey, that‚Äôs** ***me!*** **- just asked you for the third time to** ***finally*** **make an appointment with your dentist, because your breath stinks something** ***fierce.*** **The assignment is not** ***that*** **tough yet, but you have to choose now: Would you rather, a: follow your wives wishes and call the dentist‚Äôs office, although you know that you haven‚Äôt been there for years and they‚Äôll definitely notice and judge you for it, or b: receive** ***ten*** **lashings on your bare back. Choose now, please!**



**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **Ah-hah, see I realise it seems like since you are here already, you won‚Äôt have to go through with it, but when we** ***actually*** **torture people this way we will manipulate their memories into thinking this is an actual choice they have to make in the real world, and we‚Äôre even going to make them go to the dentist for real. Answer honestly again, please.**



**‚Ä¶**



\[surprised\] ***Really?*** **You would choose to get** ***lashed*** **over this? Wow, I feel kinda bad now, this is like the most mild thing our RnD department could come up with. Thank you nonetheless, let‚Äôs move on to assignment number two!**



(SFX: Speaker snapping her fingers, scenery changes to a busy office building so office ambience in the background.)



\[soothing\] **Hey, steady now! Remember, we haven‚Äôt** ***really*** **teleported to your office. You could say this is a sort of simulation, it‚Äôs meant to put you into the right headspace for the scenario.**¬†

\[cordial\] **Picture this: it‚Äôs friday afternoon, you‚Äôve been working** ***all*** **day and that game you‚Äôve been waiting for has finally been released. Your wife is at her parents house for the weekend, leaving you all the time in the world to enjoy the game. Just before you were going to go home for the day, your manager approaches you and asks you to stay late, because a couple of customers are coming to the office for a networking-party. Do you a: stay for the networking-party, knowing you are required to approach and introduce yourself to at least five strangers and listen to them speak of ‚Äúsynergies‚Äù, ‚Äúscalables‚Äù and ‚Äúideating‚Äù or do you b: go home to enjoy your game, but the whole time you have to sit on glowing hot coals and drink boiling liquid? Oh, it also says here the networking-party will continue on to a** ***nightclub!*** **How fun!** (giggle)



**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **Well, well, well, this is almost** ***too*** **easy! You do know that you don‚Äôt have to choose the literal torture** ***everytime,*** **right? Is interacting with people like that really so bad in your mind?**¬†



**‚Ä¶**



\[teasing\] **Oh sure, we** ***do*** **have networking-parties as well. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pretty invigorating, though we usually don‚Äôt talk much during, if you know what I mean. Moving on, we got a bunch more of these to go through!**¬†



(SFX: Speaker snapping her fingers, scenery changes to a crowded furniture store, so appropriate ambience in the background.)



\[upbeat\] **This one‚Äôs one of my** ***favorites!*** **You might recognize that we are now in your local furniture store - don‚Äôt say the name, management gets really pissy about copyright - and it‚Äôs crowded in here. Now the scenario-**



**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **Hey, who are you calling a** ***foul demon?*** **Is that any way to talk to your wife?** (giggle) **Alright, I can tell you‚Äôre kinda reaching your limit here, so let‚Äôs make this the last scenario for today, huh? Come now, it‚Äôs not even** ***that*** **bad.**¬†



‚Ä¶



\[cordial\] ***That‚Äôs*** **the spirit. Now, you‚Äôre at the furniture store with your wife - hello again! - and you‚Äôve been here for an hour already. That‚Äôs when she notices that there is a big sale going on that includes all of the furniture you would need to finally renovate the living room of your house the exact way she wanted to for a while. Do you a: get a shopping cart, run around the store and collect all** ***twenty*** **boxes you need to assemble the furniture, get in line for what looks like another half hour at least, and then assemble all the furniture at home? Or do you b: choose to instead get** ***slowly*** **quartered by horses, with the guarantee that you will be revived afterwards with no lasting injury? As an added incentive, while you were contemplating, your wife started looking at the wall paint rack!**¬†



**‚Ä¶**



\[surprised\] **Jesus Christ, you don‚Äôt have to** ***yell,*** **you know? I get it, I should‚Äôve known before asking but this is for science after all! Man, should we go back home now?**



(SFX: Speaker snapping her fingers, scenery changes to the house from the beginning.)



\[upbeat\] **There we go, back home again. This was already so enlightening, you‚Äôre a big help! Now, since you‚Äôve been such a good boy so far, how about we finish with one last question?**



**‚Ä¶**



\[teasing\] **I know I said no more questions, but I‚Äôm a demon, remember?** (chuckle) **Don‚Äôt worry, this one‚Äôs special. Tea or hot chocolate?**



**‚Ä¶**



\[amused\] **You heard me. If you had to choose right now, would you like tea or some hot chocolate? Or maybe‚Ä¶ coffee? It‚Äôs not a hard question, is it?**



**‚Ä¶**

\[soothing\] **Got it. I‚Äôll get you some then, how about you relax on the couch for now? I see you are confused, but remember: for the next 365 days, today included, I will be your loving wife. Not just as a form of torture, we recognize that humans need some form of coping once on a while, lest your brittle minds break, and we can‚Äôt have that. The work we‚Äôre doing here is very important, so I will make sure that you stay sane for the time being. I know it‚Äôll take some time, but I hope that you will learn to confide in me whenever you feel the need to. Now, enough about work, I feel like I need to get to know you better to confidently assess this whole experiment. Wait here and get comfortable, darling, I‚Äôll be right back with your drink, and then we‚Äôll have a long and deep talk about your deepest, darkest thoughts.** (sinister laugh)

Ever been hooked by a fishing hook before? Most of the time, you don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs there until you see it, stuck right into the back of your hand, leg, wherever else it decides to latch on.

Time to time I think I feel one of those hooks latching onto my right arm and it puts me in a panic every time. I get nightmares of being taken away by them, just pulled out the window and gone.

But I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. Let me go back about 7 months ago.

My name‚Äôs Nathan. Back in early August, my grandfather passed away from heart failure at 73. In Newfoundland, that‚Äôs pretty rare. Most people don‚Äôt even make it that far before heart problems catch up with them.

He was more than just a grandfather to me. He was the reason I made it through a lot of tough times after my father left when I was just 8. He did everything in his power to keep my mom and me afloat and 20 years later, he was still supporting us in every way he could, never asking for anything in return.

Hell, the only reason I didn‚Äôt know what happened to him sooner was because he was on his way to celebrate with me. I‚Äôd just landed a new job I‚Äôd been working toward for months and he wanted to mark the occasion. He hopped in his old truck to grab a small cake, but he passed away at a red light before he could even get home.

He was one of a kind. Losing him felt like part of me was ripped out, leaving a massive hole. After his burial we did what we could to sell whatever he had. House, truck, tools, we just didn‚Äôt have space for it and it took some time to pull off, it also hurt a little giving up his things.

That‚Äôs when I found his old key ring. They weren‚Äôt for his truck, he never had spares for it, but to the cabin he used to own. In Newfoundland, cabins are common. People use them to escape for a while or, for some, to go moose hunting. My grandfather wasn‚Äôt much of a hunter, but he‚Äôd slip out there every now and then to get away. I remember a few times he took me there one of those trips was when he tried to teach me to drive at 16. That lesson ended quickly when I went just a little too fast and crashed his truck into one of the trees in the area. I‚Äôm pretty sure my mom yelled at him the entire day we got back but all he cared about was that I was fine in the end.

The cabin was about an hour outside of his home town, down a dirt road that barely even qualified as a road. You could easily miss it if you weren‚Äôt looking for it. It was in the perfect spot, just far enough away from everything, surrounded by trees for cover, but still close enough to the shoreline if you felt like fishing. And now, here I was, holding the only set of keys he had for it.

I didn‚Äôt tell my mother about the cabin even though now I wish I did. But at the time, I didn‚Äôt know if the cabin had been sold, given to one of us, or just left to rot. The urge to go there one more time before it was potentially taken away from us was stronger than anything else, I had to go.

The plan was simple: I told my mother I was going out of town to meet up with an old high school friend who was getting married soon, but also to clear my head from everything so far. I would be gone for 4 days, enough time to drive there, stick around for a day or two and then drive back without her knowing. She didn‚Äôt question it, I booked the time off and I headed out when the time came.

I overpacked of course. Instead of bringing just a few days worth of food and water, I ended up with 6 days worth of water and food. I also brought a fresh bottle of Screech and enough gasoline to keep the small generator my grandfather had up there running the entire time I was there. I did all of this in the next town over just to make sure my mother wouldn‚Äôt catch me packing supplies for the cabin.

Once I had everything, I hit the road. I didn‚Äôt stop until I reached that dirt road my grandfather had used for years. I‚Äôve always hated that road, it was so bumpy it felt like I was getting whiplash every few minutes. My forgotten cold coffee didn‚Äôt stand a chance the moment I got on that dirt road, flying everywhere within the first few minutes and making a mess I couldn‚Äôt clean up until I was done getting to the cabin.

Even after all these years seeing the cabin still standing felt surreal. Its bright blue exterior stuck out against the surrounding trees. It wasn‚Äôt big, but that was part of its charm. All you needed in a cabin like this was a place to sit, cook, eat, sleep, and well...shit. Anything beyond that was an unnecessary luxury.

Behind the cabin, my grandfather had a small shed where he kept his tools and the generator that powered the lights and mini-fridge. The generator could run for about 10 hours, but I wasn‚Äôt planning on running it that long but if I did I brought enough gas to make it last, especially for some late night drinking.

I stepped up to the door, unlocked it and swung it wide open to let in the fresh air. Inside there was a small countertop on the right, enough space to prepare food, and a makeshift sink made from a cheap bucket and a couch to the side tucked into the corner of the cabin‚Äôs living room. No plumbing of course, we always had to bring our own water for drinking and washing. There was also a makeshift shower near the shed and an old outhouse a little further out which I had to spray down with bug repellent. The bathroom built in the cabin was nothing more than a seat with a bucket for those frigid winter nights if you didn‚Äôt want to freeze your ass off in the snow. No one used it as a bathroom honestly so we just used it as a small storage room.

The cabin only had four windows. One in the front, one in front of the kitchen sink and 2 small ones in the bedroom and bathroom. My grandfather didn‚Äôt keep much here, there was a small coffee table, a loveseat and two folding chair. The centerpiece of the cabin, though, was the old wood stove, which had probably been there longer than my grandfather. It was a sturdy and heavy wood stove with a flat top to boil your water for tea or cook any meal you wanted. He always preferred to cook on that thing then any electric stove top we brought even if it meant burning everything that touched it.

There was one other thing in the cabin I had to check though, one thing my grandfather showed me and told me to keep a secret even from my mother. Once you move the couch out of the way you could find two boards in the wall that stuck out from the others that were not nailed in but screwed into the wall. A quick twist with an old screwdriver and I had access to my grandfather‚Äôs rifle he had tucked away in the wall for safekeeping.

He knew all about Canadian gun laws and the need to keep ammo and weapons separate, but he didn‚Äôt care much for the rules. The rifle he owned wasn‚Äôt registered and it was an old Ross rifle, the same kind used by the Newfoundland military in World War 1. The fact that he had one and it still worked amazed me. ""It came with the cabin,"" he told me once, which made me question just how old this cabin really was. I knew the cabin had been fixed up a long time ago but old enough to last since World War 1? For now I just screwed the boards back on and left the rifle there, I had no reason to have it out right now and tucked the couch back in its place to hide it.

Once I was done inspecting the inside of the cabin and headed back outside to grab everything I packed, it was then it started to happen. I didn‚Äôt notice the hook hanging there dead center to the door when I was leaving and right away it sliced the right side of my face right on my cheek. It stung like hell and touching where it cut me I could already feel a small bit of blood on my finger tips. I wasn‚Äôt sure where it came from but I remember thinking to myself how much it would suck to leave just for a tetanus shot.

I grabbed the line that the hook was attached to, wrapping it around my hand, and gave it a tug, trying to pull it free from wherever it was tied to. But the more I tugged, the less sense it made. I figured it was probably attached to the wall or maybe even the roof for some strange reason but every time I pulled it felt a little to loose

Finally with one good yank I ripped it free, the long, nearly invisible line, dropped in front of me. It was much longer than it should‚Äôve been. I could‚Äôve easily wrapped it around the entire cabin without a problem. I figured it was just an extra bit of line left by my grandfather, or whoever had put it up, who hadn‚Äôt bothered to trim it down. I coiled it up, tied it off, and tossed it beside the front door for later. I‚Äôd deal with it properly once I was done unpacking the truck.

I was exhausted. I needed food and thanks to that damn hook, a band aid. Unpacking was quick, even setting up the gas generator my grandfather had was easy enough. Once everything was inside and the generator was roaring, I got to work cleaning up and eventually cooked myself dinner. When night rolled around and I was ready to sleep. As much as I wanted to stay awake a little longer my body was begging for a nap after being on the road for so long. So I slipped outside, turned off the generator for the night and headed to the cabin door.

As soon as I reached the door I spotted something at the very edge of my sight. It was pretty dark outside but I could have sworn I saw something at the tree line, so I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight mode, pointing it in the direction I saw whatever it was.

To my surprise I could make out what looked like a moose standing in the distance. Newfoundland is known for its moose population, there are so many now that they‚Äôve become a real problem, especially for drivers. But this was the first time I‚Äôd seen a moose near the cabin like this. Now thinking about it, I think this was the first time I‚Äôve seen any animal near the cabin and there was a full grown moose in the distance, maybe looking in my direction.

I quietly stepped inside, locked the door and brushed it off. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time. I was tired and my only focus was getting to bed to enjoy my time at the cabin for the next few days. I had a plan and no moose was going to stop me at this point.

The next morning I was still partly waking up when I went outside to grab some wood for the stove. I was already craving a cup of tea and as I made my way toward the back of the cabin I felt another sudden sting, this time from the top of my right hand. This one stung like hell. I think it was the jolt from it that made me jerk my hand away and made things worse as the hook poked through the other end of my skin. This one was a lot thicker compared to the first one that got me and it stung like hell.

Looking at the hook embedded in my skin only made the pain worse. I knew I had to break the line before I could do anything else and coiled it up a bit in my left hand to give it a tug, trying to pull it free.

Nothing.

In fact, it felt like the line was pulling back slightly as I tried again. I couldn‚Äôt figure out where it was tied, but I kept pulling thinking it was probably attached to the roof or something. It didn't take me long to realize the line wasn‚Äôt attached to the roof at all this time.

The line was coming from the sky.

For a second I convinced myself the wind must‚Äôve blown it out from a tree or something. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, making it look like the line was hanging from the sky. But deep down I knew what I was looking at and I won‚Äôt lie, it scared the hell out of me.

I gathered all my strength and pulled on the line until it snapped much like the first one I found. This line was longer though. I didn‚Äôt waste any time and headed inside to grab my pliers. I needed to cut the hook off thanks to the barbed end it had, if I just pulled it out it would just rip through my skin more than anything, but with the hook being thicker this time it took a bit out of me to just cut it in half. I did thankfully, pulling both pieces out and throwing it into the trash.

I wasn‚Äôt sure whether I should get it checked out. It was a pretty big hook and who knew how long it had been there? But I also did want to just leave and waste an entire day getting it checked out either. I decided to check my phone and see if I could find a quick answer. Instead I was greeted with no signal, forgetting I was in the middle of the woods where it would be pure luck to get one out here.

I walked all around the inside of the cabin for the smallest signal at first before heading outside, checking every spot near there for anything before finally finding one spot that worked. It was just outside the kitchen window when I spotted the small signal bar pop up and allowed me very slow access to the internet again.

I must have been out there for a little while looking for some kind of quick answer when something caught my eye and nearly jumped out of my skin when I noticed it finally, just barely catching my phone in the process.

About 20 to 30 feet from the cabin, there was a moose, maybe the same one from the night before. It was standing motionless in the thicker part of the trees, just staring in my direction. What really shook me though was how quiet it was.

If you‚Äôve ever seen a moose, you know how loud they can be. These massive animals are hard to miss, especially where the trees are packed together in places. A moose moving around will always make some noise. But this one? It was dead silent.

Something kept telling me in the back of my head that something wasn‚Äôt right, something about this moose just felt off as I made my way to the corner of the cabin, my eyes locked on it as I did. The moment I reached the corner I was greeted with something else, another hook. This one thankfully caught the sleeve of my shirt as I tried to walk away. My immediate instinct was to pull away, let it tear through my shirt and just not worry about it, the moment I did I watched as the hook came free before suddenly being pulled straight up into the air and out of sight. I didn‚Äôt know what I just saw at first and just stood there trying to see where it went.¬†

Where it went was up into the sky.

It must have clicked in my head shortly after because when it did I bolted to the cabin door. Something wasn‚Äôt right about this cabin suddenly and my first reaction to it all was getting the fuck out of there. I wasn‚Äôt going to stick around and find out what the hell was going on, I was going to leave and find out later if I could. I raced back inside and grabbed one of the empty bags I had brought with me, packing it with whatever I could without any real knowledge of what I was grabbing. I was more spooked by this than I thought I was now thinking about it, but god I wished I moved a little faster when I started.

I didn‚Äôt even care about the generator. I figured I would leave it, let it run itself out of gas and the problem solved .The need to go back there and shut everything down properly was being overrun by the need to simply leave. I was nearly done packing the bags when I heard it, the kitchen window shattering into a thousand pieces. Glass and wood was thrown into the cabin so suddenly I thought something had exploded behind me, making me jolt away from the sound before turning to it.

The damn moose was there, I knew it was because the moment I looked toward the window I could see just the smallest piece of its antlers poking inside before it pulled it back outside. Before I could react I heard another window smash, then another. For whatever reason the moose outside had smashed almost all of the windows and yet I still could not hear anything from it, not a single step.

""Fuck this,"" I remember muttering to myself.

I shoved the couch out of the way with all my mite and kicked the wall where the boards hid it, shattering them with one good kick. If I had to kill a moose to get out of there then god damn it, that‚Äôs what I was going to do.

I grabbed the rifle and grabbed one of the already loaded clips for it. Loading the rifle was difficult but I managed in the end, pulling the slide back then forward again to get it ready. I haven‚Äôt used it that much but my grandfather showed me how to properly use it before, nothing changed since then.

I figured if the moose was anywhere it would be near the shed, it did smash out the bedroom and bathroom windows which were close to it so that was where I would check first. With the butt of the rifle to my shoulder i swung the front door open and made my way towards the back end of the cabin. As I got closer I could finally start hearing it or something at least. Something banging on the other side. With a loud pop and bang I realized what it was. The moose was slamming its head into the generator and had killed it. Why the hell it was doing that I had no idea, but I knew I had to act fast.

Reaching the corner of the cabin I was finally in sight of the damn thing but god do i wish I never did now. The moose, this hulking beast of an animal stood tall over the now dead generator, raising its head up high now that it was done beating it to death before slowly turning its head towards me.

One of its antlers had snapped off at the base from repeatedly slamming it into the generator, leaving just a sharp stub sticking out of its head. But that was nothing compared to the rest of the sight.

Its fur was patchy, missing in some places, revealing pale raw skin beneath with spots of rot and decay. The moment it had turned its head towards me I could see a part of its lip was hanging loose, bits and pieces of it torn up and with old blood gunk up. And it‚Äôs eyes, god those nearly pure white eyes staring blankly back at me as it stood there.

This moose had been dead for some time now and holding it up were hundreds, maybe thousands of these hooks and lines scattered all across its body, suspending it upwards like a puppet with its feet never actually touching the ground, only looking like it was even on the ground to begin with. All of these super thin lines shot straight up into the air like all of the other ones I had seen by then, controlling every movement this moose made. No wonder it looked off to me when I first spotted it.

I stood there frozen, rifle aimed at the abomination before me, its hollow eyes met mine and in that moment, time felt like it stopped. My breath was trapped in my chest, my hands cold as ice as I held that rifle. I squeezed the trigger before I even understood what was going on and watched as the round landed right into the thing's right eye with a small wet pop before exiting the other side, a small bit of old gunk up blood pouring out where the eye once was. There was no reaction, no twitch, no flinch, nothing. It simply stood there, unfeeling, unaffected by the shot that would have killed most mooseI. I reacted by cocking the gun, pulling then pushing the slide back in place to ready another round as it kept its dead sight on me. The next round hit its rib cage, a small splatter of blood but no exit wound this time as I cocked the rifle yet again.

The best way I can explain how this thing moved is again like a puppeteer simply swung it towards me, lunging forward and forcing myself to jump back out of its reach as it slammed into the corner of the cabin. It bounced off the corner of the cabin like some crazed marionette, its movement odd and awkward at the same time as the hooks attached to it guided it back my way. In my moment of panic I walked quickly backwards, trying to get the rifle up fast enough to take another shot as the gun let out another snap

The bullet hit the rotten piece of the moose's back and I watched as it tore a large chunk off and shot straight up into the sky like trash caught in high winds. The amount of lines and hooks that went with it must have off-balanced the thing, shifting its weight to the side as it once again rammed into the cabin wall with an unsettling force where it paused for a brief moment. I remember my hands were shaky but not enough for me to cock the rifle one more time. The moment the next round was ready I watched in horror as this massive dead beast was simply pulled up into the air and out of sight. It was simply gone.

I frantically looked everywhere for that thing, unsure if it was just gone or waiting for me to fuck up and surprise me. It took me a bit but I considered everything in the cabin a lose as I made a mad dash for the truck, rifle in my left hand while right hand dug in my pocket for the keys, panic making everything so much harder to find them. I had just barely managed to pull the keys free when it returned.

It plummeted from the sky like some sort of twisted Ferris wheel, crashing into the side of the truck with a deafening impact. The impact drove the truck nearly seven feet to the side with enough force to almost flip it on to its side, I was mere inches away from it when it hit the door, forcing me to leap back and fall on my ass before stumbling back to my feet again.

The moose was barely unrecognizable. Both of its shattered antlers were almost nearly gone at this point and the remnants of its skin clung to its body in patches, revealing broken bones, exposed ribs and rotting flesh. Fragments of its skull and ribcage jutted from its body like broken shards of glass.

I tried to raise my rifle once more but before I could fire it was on me. The force slammed into me, pushing me backward until my back crashed into the cabin window and shattering the glass in an instant. The rifle slipped from my hands, and in that brief moment of disorientation, I struggled to catch my breath. There was no time to think, no time to plan, no time to wait. I did the only thing I could, I ran back inside. I sprinted back inside my heart pounding and reached the makeshift sink as the creature crashed into the door. It hit with such force that the wood exploded, splintering and cracking as it attempted to force its way inside. The only way for me to explain the situation was like watching someone control a puppet and trying to make them walk into a small house where the strings could get into, making parts of its limbs just drop and act dead on the spot as the lines attached to it dug into the wood. It struggled to get inside for a while before becoming lifeless, dead in its spot. It didn‚Äôt take long before all of the hooks and line attached to the corpse dragged it back outside and straight up in the air once again, not a sound to be made.

The best way I could describe what I was witnessing was like watching someone manipulate a puppet trying to force it to walk into a tiny house, the strings tangled and got caught in the roof and ceiling, causing parts of the puppet‚Äôs limbs to suddenly go limp and hang dead as the lines pulled tight against the wood. It struggled for a while, trying to force itself inside but eventually it went completely still, lifeless, frozen in place like a real corpse. It didn‚Äôt take long before the hooks and strings that had been attached to its body yanked it back out, lifting it up into the air without a single sound.

I stood there in silence overlooking the chaos that was left behind by this thing, splattering of old rotting blood, small bits and pieces of fur and flesh along with scattered wood and glass from the window and door. My breath was fast, still catching up to everything that happened moments before the silence as I took a few steps forward to look outside. I kept a bit of distance from the doorway still, giving myself enough space in case it came back with another surprise attack as I scanned the area. There was nothing, just dead silence.

That silence lasted only a moment before a loud and sudden¬†*BANG*¬†echoed from outside the cabin as a round from the rifle went off and ripped through the wall beside me before ending up inside the kitchen wall on the other side. Wherever the corpse went it had taken the rifle straight up with it before hitting the ground with such force to set off the loaded round live in the chamber. Won't lie, I think I pissed myself from that honestly.

After both near death experiences I ran to the couch and shoved it in front of the front door before grabbed the old bed and propping it up against the window as well, blocking any sight of that beast if it was to come back before tucking myself into the very corner the couch was in before all of this. It was the safest place in my mind, furthest from the windows and door leading outside where that thing could potentially get me.

I was stuck in this cabin.

I didn‚Äôt dare to try and leave as the hours dragged on, day became night and I risked it to get to the wood stove to light it up, giving me some better vision of the area around me inside the cabin. I barely moved, stunned by everything that had led to this as the realization I was stuck here started to leak into my mind. There was nothing I could do but sit here and wait, waiting for something to happen as I made the bottle of Screech my only friend in this world now.

My truck was completely fucked after what that thing did to it and it was the only safe way for me to get out of this place. I couldn‚Äôt just run away with a corpse like that flying around here to pounce when it was time, plus how many of those hooks were outside as well? I only bumped into a few of them and all I know they could be anywhere. I was stuck here. I must have drank half the bottle that night, pausing every moment I heard something outside or mumbling to myself about things long past. Did my grandfather know about this? What was controlling that thing outside attacking me? Should I leave a message in case someone finds me? I had so many thoughts running through my mind as I sat there, the glow of the wood stove lighting the room around me as I checked my phone for the time. I don‚Äôt remember much in that moment being piss drunk, but seeing my phone somehow gave me the idea of calling for help. I had to shake my drunken mind away and really think of how I was going to pull this off. If I could get a single 911 call out maybe, just maybe I could get someone here to save me. It was a long shot but it was the only shot I had, the only real problem was getting a signal. I knew where I could get even a small one, but that's what made it so much worse to think about it. It was my only chance to get out of here and I had to at the very least try.

My body felt heavy, exhausted even the more I tried to get myself up off the floor, a plan set in stone but unsure if I can even pull it off. Out the kitchen window was all I needed to reach out to, that was all I had to do. I can pre-dial the number and wait until i got a signal before pressing ‚ÄòCall‚Äô on the phone to try and contact someone to help, but the more I looked towards the shattered kitchen window the more fearful I became, frightened of that thing just being around the corner and hitting when I was at my weakest.

My hands were shaking as I got the phone ready, only 10% power left was enough to get a phone call out as I dialed in the number. I kept my thumb over the ‚ÄòCall‚Äô button on the screen as I crept up to the window and slowly stretched my right arm little by little outside of the wrecked frame. I kept scanning the area, keeping an eye out for the corpse to return and attack me as I reached further and further outside. My hope was fading pretty quickly the further i stretched myself out that window, trying not to cut myself on the glass until I saw it, a green signal bar popping up on the top right of the screen as I press ‚ÄòCall‚Äô on the screen. The relief that overcame when I heard the sound of the phone ringing was like a rush, but only for a moment.

The phone slipped from my grasp as a surge of pain coursed through me intense and blinding, as though every nerve ending in my arm was being pulled and twisted. I looked down in horror to see hooks anchoring into my skin, spreading from my shoulder all the way to my fingertips piercing deeper with each pull. Instinctively I tried to wrench myself free, but the hooks resisted, tugging me back with a violent force instead. If my left arm hadn‚Äôt been braced against the cabin, I would‚Äôve been dragged right out, pulled into the dark with no hope of escape. The pain was so overwhelming that for a moment I thought I might collapse from sheer agony.¬†

The pain was unbearable, it felt like I was being ripped apart little by little. Even though I was fighting for my life something in my mind shifted from being frightened to fighting back. I wasn‚Äôt going to be some puppet, dragged away and strung up like that damn moose, I was going to get away from this one way or another. With every ounce of strength I had I started to pull with all my might, intense pain jolting through me more and more as I pulled but I couldn‚Äôt stop.

I managed to get my foot up on the wall for leverage, giving me extra strength to work with as I started to pull with everything I had. I yanked myself back inside, my body slammed against the floor and came to a stop in the corner where the couch once was as my breathing became ragged, exhaustion taking over me as I laid there.

As the adrenaline started to fade that‚Äôs when I felt the full force of the pain.¬† I had to pull myself up with my left arm before seeing my right arm shredded to pieces. Strips of skin were missing all the way from my shoulder to my fingers, on top of that I had pulled with such force I lost the top of my middle finger and my ring finger, only half of them remained. Blood was rushing with the beat of my heart and as my heart rated increased I had to do what I could in pure agony

The moment was a blur to me, a bad panic of trying to stop the bleeding while thoughts of bleeding out ran through my mind. What I do remember was one idea of just pouring the remaining bottle of Screech over the wounds and shoving my arm into the wood stove, burning the wounds closed to stop the bleeding, but even I knew that was a terrible idea and would have only made more problems. Instead I must have just wrapped it up the best I could and poured I think what was rubbing alcohol all over the cloth I used which turned out to be a bed sheet and a t-shirt before passing out from that alone. Time was a blur at that point. I remember laying on that floor for a long while, other times I remember struggling to open and cook canned and bottle goods I brought with me. I think I even wrote a letter to my mother at one point fearing that I wasn't coming out of this alive. I didn‚Äôt think I was at that time. The final night I do remember pretty clearly. The pain in my right arm started to get worse as I laid there may be either half dead or half asleep. The fire in the wood stove had died out and the only thing I could hear was the rustling of the trees from the wind outside. I was ready for death to take me as I laid there but the longer I waited the more light I started to notice. I thought I was hallucinating when this all happened, it wasn‚Äôt until I heard the officers voice yell out before coming inside.

Before I knew it I was waking up in a hospital bed, the lights nearly blinding me when I finally woke up. The RCMP officer who spoke to me in the hospital explained that my 911 call did get through. They heard a struggle on the line, but the call dropped before they could track it down properly. They had only a vague idea of where the cabin was, which is why it took them so long to find me. But they found me, just in time.

I told them everything. The hooks, the moose, the damage to my arm, everything. I‚Äôm not sure if they believed me but they knew something had happened. The doctors said I was lucky I didn‚Äôt bleed out from how much was torn away on my arm. The doctor probably didn‚Äôt buy my story either, but that didn‚Äôt matter. All he needed to do was help me recover.

I stayed in the hospital for a while. I was too terrified to leave and was convinced that whatever attacked me was still out there. My fear kept me in that sterile room an extra day or two, even though I was physically well enough to go. It wasn‚Äôt until my mother insisted I leave that I finally agreed in hesitation and I went to stay with her for a few more days before heading back to my own home.

It's been 7 months since then.¬†

Writing all of this down has been difficult and doing what I just did was even harder. Part of me wants to believe it was just some twisted figment of my imagination, a way for my mind to shield me from what really happened. But I know what I saw.

The hardest part? I can‚Äôt prove any of it anymore.

The cabin is gone.

I just returned from driving out there, hoping for any shred of evidence that it was real. But when I got there it was gone. No remains, no pieces of the cabin, just nothing. It was as if it had never existed. I called everyone in the area and no one knew anything about it, not even the RCMP, who‚Äôd investigated the site days after they found me. According to them, the cabin should still be there.

But it wasn‚Äôt.

The only thing I found was a single, small fishing hook, tightly tied to a frail line.",2,1751156317.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

When I found a post tucked away in the dark corners of the internet, my interest was piqued. It was titled: Killers Anonymous.

At first, I thought it was a joke made to scare or morbidly amuse people, but I was wrong.  It was a support group created for people like me. When I was about 18, I began to loathe life, and I couldn‚Äôt stand seeing my peers enjoying theirs. I would spend hours alone, but it grew into days of no contact. The drugs and alcohol I had been using started flooding my mind with unsavory things. I started fantasizing about death, and I imagined becoming the one who dishes it out. I would relish in thinning about the high I could achieve through such an act. A high that no drug could provide me. A high that I would never come down from. I knew it was wrong to think that way, but I couldn‚Äôt help but take pleasure from it.


After thoroughly reading the post, I was hesitant to apply. What if this were some new way for law enforcement to collect information on potentially dangerous people? I thought. I applied regardless, and after about a week, I finally received the confirmation email. The email contained almost all of the same information as the post. I scrolled down to the bottom, which contained their meeting schedule. ‚ÄúHmm, next Friday?‚Äù I said. After I had passed the idea around in my head for several days, I decided to go. I was still nervous, but also excited. I was finally going to get the chance to speak about these urges, and not have someone shame me for them. At least I hoped I wouldn‚Äôt be. I had never told anyone about them before, but could you blame me? This isn‚Äôt exactly a problem everyone struggles with.


Friday came quickly, and as I stood outside the house I was told to meet at, anxiety began to build. Once again, what if all this was a setup? I thought. I swallowed my fears and made my way to the front door. I gave a few firm knocks, and a woman opened and greeted me. She was a cute brunette, and she looked to be in her late twenties.


‚ÄúOh hello, are you here for the group?‚Äù She said with a cheerfulness about her.


‚ÄúYes, yes I am,‚Äù I said as I reached out to shake her hand.


‚ÄúGood to meet you,‚Äù she said while returning my gesture,‚Äù please come in and make yourself at home. We will be starting soon, but first, which group are you in?‚Äù


I paused and was confused by her question. ‚ÄúI thought it was just the one group?‚Äù I asked.


‚ÄúOh no, there are actually four groups,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúone group wouldn‚Äôt be big enough. You would be surprised by how many people we get. Group 4 has fewer people if you would like to start with a smaller group.‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in group four then,‚Äù I said before walking inside.

Greeting me were two large living rooms to the right and left. Each room had chairs placed in a circular pattern. There was also a staircase leading into what looked like another large space.


‚ÄúYour group is in the left room,‚Äù the woman explained, ‚Äùyou made the right choice coming here, and I hope we can help.‚Äù


‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said before taking my seat.

After about thirty minutes of waiting, both of the bottom rooms now looked full of people. An older man in our circle, probably about sixty, stood from his chair and introduced himself.


‚ÄúHello everyone, my name is Troy [Redacted], and I‚Äôll be mediating tonight. I would like to start by saying how proud I am that you‚Äôre all here tonight. I know all of you are probably nervous and hesitant, but I want you all to know you‚Äôre safe here. Now, I see that we have some new faces here tonight. Would anyone like to introduce themselves?‚Äù 


After a few seconds of silence, another man in the group broke the tension.

‚ÄúI would,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúMy name is Mike.‚Äù


‚ÄúNice to meet you, Mike,‚Äù Troy responded, ‚ÄúWould you like to tell the group a bit about yourself and maybe why you‚Äôre here?‚Äù


‚ÄúUmm sure,‚Äù Mike said with an unsure tone, ‚ÄúI was just a young boy when it started. It was small with just some thoughts, images, and fantasies. But after a few years, I started to experiment with dissecting animals. Mostly small ones like birds, rodents, and the occasional cat. Taking away the lives of animals brought a sense of comfort. I would strangle, stab, drown, electrocute, and then dismember them to finish. I felt in complete control, and my mind would become free and clear again. But the older I got, and the harder life got, I needed to do it more and more often.  Recently, it hasn‚Äôt been helping at all.


Mike went silent before Troy responded, ‚ÄúThat was very brave of you son. Not a lot of people can open up about their thoughts and actions like that.‚Äù


Mike‚Äôs story fascinated me. I too had considered killing animals for pleasure, but I didn‚Äôt think it would provide enough satisfaction to satiate me. Besides, I actually liked and respected animals. It was people I had a vendetta against.


Troy turned his gaze towards me, ‚ÄúHow about you son? Would you feel comfortable introducing yourself to the group?‚Äù


I nodded in agreement and told them about my disgust for people. About how I hated my own life, and explained my feelings towards how others enjoyed theirs. After I was done, I scanned the room. Everyone looked visibly uncomfortable with what I was saying. I took a deep breath before finishing, ‚Äúbut now I‚Äôm here, and looking for help.‚Äù


Troy stood again, ‚ÄúThank you, Eli.‚Äù He said before giving me the same comforting message that he gave Mike.


After Troy sat back down, another woman raised her hand before saying she wanted to go next. She told the group about how she hated her parents and wanted to kill them. After she explained herself, she broke down in tears. Troy began to comfort her before calling the meeting to a close. After the group stood and exchanged pleasantries, I made my way over to Mike who was standing on the porch.


‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs Mike right?‚Äù I said while tapping him on the shoulder.


‚ÄúYeah, What‚Äôs up?‚Äù He asked.


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a whole lot of people who I can talk to about these sort of things, so I was wondering if you would like to get some lunch? I asked. 


‚ÄúUmm, sure, why not?‚Äù He said with a sign of hesitation.


‚ÄúGreat! How does Jen‚Äôs Diner sound?‚Äù 


‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù He said before giving a slight smile.


After a few-mile drive, I pulled into the diner parking lot. Mike pulled in right after. We walked inside and were approached by an attractive young waitress. 


‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù She asked.


‚ÄúTwo,‚Äù I answered, ‚Äúand can we get a booth?‚Äù


‚ÄúSure can! Right this way.‚Äù


She guided us to our booth before asking, ‚ÄúSo what can I start you two off with to drink?‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a water.‚Äù Said Mike.


‚ÄúSure thing, and you sir?‚Äù 


I looked deep into her eyes. She looked so sweet and innocent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have the same,‚Äù I said with a smile.


‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll have those waters out to y‚Äôall shortly.‚Äù She said before walking off.


‚ÄúSo Eli, what made you want to join the‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶ the group?‚Äù Mike asked while seeming a bit fidgety.


‚ÄúI guess I finally felt like it was time to get some help. Though, I don‚Äôt remember you ever saying what you wanted out of the group?‚Äù I asked.


‚ÄúWell, I guess you could say I want help, but I also kinda don‚Äôt.‚Äù Mike said while looking down and avoiding eye contact.


‚ÄúSame,‚Äù I said with a chuckle, ‚ÄúI want help, but I still really wanna try it at least once.‚Äù


His eyes looked up with a glimpse of curiosity curiosity in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou know I was-‚Äú Mike said before being cut off.


‚ÄúHere are those waters,‚Äù said the waitress, ‚Äúare y‚Äôall ready, or do you need a few more minutes?‚Äù


I looked at Mike and gestured to confirm before responding, ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre ready. I‚Äôll take the club house sandwich and chips.‚Äù


‚ÄúAll righty, and what will you have?‚Äù She said while looking at Mike.


‚ÄúI‚Äôll have the working man‚Äôs burger with fries and no mayo please,‚Äù Mike said while looking more comfortable and open.


‚ÄúSure thing, I‚Äôll be back with y‚Äôall‚Äôs orders as soon as it‚Äôs ready.‚Äù She said before once again, heading back to the kitchen.‚Äù


‚ÄúBack to what I was saying,‚Äù Mike said after taking a sip of water, ‚ÄúI had an idea. What if just once, we follow through with our urges? You know‚Ä¶ just to see if we truly have it in us or not.‚Äù


I felt it was a great idea before saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, are you sure that‚Äôs something you want to do?‚Äù


‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said with confidence, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been sure for a long time.‚Äù


When he said that, I could hear the seriousness in his tone.I reached out my hand to meet his. It felt like two partners agreeing on a business deal. After a few minutes went by, the waitress returned with our food.


‚ÄúHere you are. One clubhouse sandwich with chips, and one working man‚Äôs burger with fries with no mayo. Enjoy!‚Äù 


We both thanked her before returning to our conversation. ‚ÄúSo, do you have anyone in mind?‚Äù I said.


I saw him peer over my shoulder to the kitchen window. He looked like a hungry predator who had just caught sight of a plump hog. ‚ÄúHow about her,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI think she would work.‚Äù


I turned to look back while having a good idea who he was referring to. It was at our gorgeous waitress. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think she would be a bit risky? Especially, since she looks young and is probably known by a lot of customers? Wouldn‚Äôt people notice if she went missing?‚Äù I asked.


‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut there isn‚Äôt anyone going to suspect us. We‚Äôre nobodies to her with no connections.‚Äù


‚ÄúOk, we‚Äôll do it,‚Äù I said hoping he was right.


A few more minutes went by, and we finished our meals. The waitress came and gave us our bills.


‚ÄúHere you both are. Will you be needing anything else?‚Äù She asked.



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Mike responded, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre good.‚Äù


As the waitress walked back to the kitchen, Mike was eyeballing her up and down. We made are way back to our vehicles. 


‚ÄúMeet me here tomorrow, and we can start planning,‚Äù Mike said.


‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù I agreed before shaking his hand once more.


I sat in my car while I watched Mike drive off in his truck. Soon after, I headed back home. I lived in a little apartment located in a more run-down part of town. It was all I could barely afford while working as a bookkeeper for a small local shop. Later that night while lying in bed and staring up at the ceiling, the feeling of losing control, which I was all too familiar with had returned to me. I thought long and hard trying to cling to the idea Mike and I had. I was hoping to be comforted by it, and it soon proved I was right. The next day, I met up with Mike at the diner at around seven o‚Äôclock in the evening just as we had planned. We had parked in the abandoned parking garage across the street to help get a better view. I got out of my car to hop into Mike older pick up truck.


‚ÄúThere she is,‚Äù Mike said while looking through a pair of binoculars, ‚Äúhello gorgeous.‚Äù


‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the plan here Mike?‚Äù I asked him.


‚ÄúI think we should just follow her home to start. See if she lives with other people or not.‚Äù He responded.


After about two hours went by, the diner looked to be closing for the night. We sat a while longer and waited for the waitress to come out. About thirty minutes later, we saw her getting into her car. Mike started the engine, and we made our way to the garage exit. We followed her for what felt like thirty minutes out of town. She led us out into the country, which wasn‚Äôt a shock since we lived in a small rural town in Georgia. She pulled off onto a dirt road. We followed a bit longer before she pulled into what looked like a driveway. We crept up in front of her home with our headlights off. Mike pulled out his binoculars again.


‚ÄúShould we just do it now?‚Äù I asked.


‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he answered sternly, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt even know if she lives alone or not yet. Besides, I wanna take her back to my place. I live in a nice, quiet, and deserted place like this.‚Äù


‚ÄúYour place?‚Äù I asked him.


‚ÄúYeah, my place. If I‚Äôm gonna do this, I want to do it right.‚Äù He said sounding like a tradesman talking about his craft.


‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said not wanting to upset him.


He didn‚Äôt respond, and instead just kept watching her. She pulled out her keys, unlocked the front door, and went inside.


‚ÄúHuh, she turned on the porch light. Maybe she is giving us the go-ahead to come on in.‚Äù Mike said while chuckling.


I laughed with him before he pressed on the gas pedal. After we hit paved road again, he asked me, ‚ÄúYou wanna come over to my place? I‚Äôll show you what I got prepped.‚Äù


Curious, I answered, ‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù


‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù He said sounding excited, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll love it, and I think it‚Äôll help give you more confidence in our plan.‚Äù


He drove us back to his place, and he was right. It was in the middle of nowhere. A small mobile home on a piece of land that had a big barn In The back. We got out and walked around back to the barn.


‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù he said sounding proud, ‚Äúthis is where we‚Äôre gonna do it.‚Äù


It looked old while littered with cobwebs and hay. The left wall when walking through the entrance, was covered in saws, hatchets, machetes, rakes, and even had a clever. It looked like a scene pulled right out of a slasher film. The right wall had metal rings, with what looked like chains and cuffs looped through them. They were lined up in a row leading all the way to the back, and it looked like a dungeon. Lastly, In the center was a large rectangular concrete slab, which looked to be about four feet high, seven feet in length, and another four feet in width. It too had metal loops drilled into it, and I could see leather straps lying on top.


‚ÄúWow, this is pretty impressive Mike. Are you sure you haven‚Äôt done this before?‚Äù I asked while laughing.


‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said while grinning and laughing, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôve been planning and thinking about it for years. I just haven‚Äôt had the gumption to finally commit to it, but now thanks to you, I do.‚Äù


‚ÄúWell after getting a good look at this place, I think everything is gonna go great,‚Äù I said.


‚ÄúHey, do you wanna come in for a beer?‚Äù He asked.


‚ÄúSure, why not,‚Äù I said after checking my watch, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only midnight. I‚Äôll have one before we head back to my car‚Äù


We stepped back out through the large barn doors, and Mike locked them back before making our way to his mobile home. We walked inside with Mike leading the way, and I could hear Mike fumbling around while trying to find the light switch. Finally, the lights came on, and Mike went to the kitchen to fetch us a couple of beers.


‚ÄúSo do you live alone here, or do your folks live here too?‚Äù I asked.


‚ÄúI got this place all to myself. My parents passed a few years back, and since I‚Äôm an only child, it all got left to me.‚Äù He said before handing me a beer. 


‚ÄúWhat happened to them?‚Äù I asked hoping not to upset him.


‚ÄúDied right in there,‚Äù Mike said while pointing to what looked like a master bedroom, ‚Äú I woke one day and found them still in bed. Cold to the touch and not moving. You know I buried them out back. Momma always hated the idea of being buried in a place full of strangers, so figured home would be more comfortable for her.‚Äù


‚ÄúAnd what about your dad, is he buried here too?‚Äù I asked, very curious to know more.


‚ÄúTechnically,‚Äù Mike said before letting out a loud laugh, ‚Äúas long as you consider being turn into pig shit being buried. Even that is probably too good for him.‚Äù


Not wanting to push the subject further, I kept silent and nodded. We continued talking for a bit longer while we finished our beers. As I stood up from his couch ready to head back, I started feeling nauseous and could barely hold my footing.


‚ÄúCan‚Äôt handle one beer?‚Äù He said before I finally stumbled to the floor. 


‚ÄúIce water,‚Äù I said while trying to hold back vomit. Mike nodded before bringing me a glass. I poured some on my face, but it didn‚Äôt help. I was in and out of consciousness for many hours, but I do remember feeling rocks and sticks rubbing against my back like I was being dragged. Next, I could hear chains rattling, and soon after, metal cuffs clamped shut around my wrists. I felt the metal dig tightly into my skin. After that, I didn‚Äôt come to until a stinging beam of sunlight pierced my eye lids from a hole in the barn wall. I looked around still feeling the lingering effects from whatever was in my drink. It was hot and humid, and my clothes were drenched in sweat. My hands were numb from being in the cuffs for so long. Mike was nowhere in sight, and I couldn‚Äôt  hear much of anything outside. I tried wiggling the chains loose, but I had no luck. As the day went by, and the lingering effects went away, so did the sunlight. The sun was setting, and the barn was soon plunged into darkness. Headlights shot through cracks in the walls and lit up the barn. Soon after, I heard the sound of crunching pine straw coming towards the barn. The sound of the barn doors opening sent chills up my spine, I started hyperventilating, and my stomach turned from the thought of what he was gonna do to me.


‚ÄúBreathe Eli,‚Äù said Mike after turning on the bright overhead lights, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even started yet.‚Äù


‚ÄúWha‚Ä¶ why are you doing this? I thought we were a team?‚Äù I said after catching my breath.


‚ÄúNo Eli. We weren‚Äôt a team. I do like you though, so I‚Äôm sorry I have to do this. If I had the strength to not give in to my temptations, I would.‚Äù He said in a dead monotone voice that I had yet heard from him.


‚ÄúWhat are you going to do to me?‚Äù I asked while trying to control my breath.


‚ÄúEli, I‚Äôm gonna be honest with you. It‚Äôs not gonna be good for you. I have temptations and compulsions that go beyond just killing.‚Äù He said before filling a syringe. 


My stomach and chest burned with fear, and I feel my body wanting to convulse. He walked over to me before sticking me in the arm with the needle. I was begging him to stop, but he just told me to hush. It didn‚Äôt take long for the effects to take hold, and I was out like a light again. After I returned to what I assumed was going to be a brief time back in the land of the living, I found myself lying on the concrete slab. My legs, arms, torso, and neck had leather straps tethering me to it. After many hours of being restricted from using the restroom, I could smell my soiled clothes. I felt like an animal locked in a pen and ready for the slaughter. As I laid there marinating in my own waste, I could hear whistling approaching the barn. Once again, the loud noise from the barn doors opening filled the air.


‚ÄúGood lord man, it smells like fucking piss and shit in here,‚Äù he said while chuckling, ‚Äúperhaps I should have put you in some diapers.‚Äù


I didn‚Äôt say anything in response. I didn‚Äôt have anything left to say to Mike that wasn‚Äôt already said. He then grabbed the cleaver that was hanging on the wall before walking over to me. He rubbed my legs down with what smelled like alcohol. After he had wiped down my legs, he grabbed my left leg to hold it still, and then raised his right arm holding the cleaver. He looked like a butcher ready to get to work. His arm swung down in full force, and I heard the bones in my leg crunch. A sharp pain rang loud through my leg. With every swing, I hear crunch after crunch. I could hear my flesh tearing and my blood gushing out. I started to blacked out from the pain.


‚ÄúNo, no, no,‚Äù Mike yelled after splashing ice-cold water in my face, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not done yet.‚Äù


I looked down at my body, and I could see my leg. It was sitting in a gray bucket that had been set between my legs. I threw up from the gruesome sight. Mike wiped my blood from his hands and face with a cloth before grabbing my right leg.


‚ÄúAlmost done Eli.‚Äù He said before hacking away again. I saw my blood splash across his face once more. The pain was too severe for me to stay conscious. The next thing I remember was ice-cold water soaking my face, and once again, bringing me back.


‚ÄúAll done for now,‚Äù he said while patting my face, ‚Äúyou sewed up real nice Eli.‚Äù


I looked back down to see that the bucket was gone, but so were both of my legs. I had stitches all over the nubs where my legs once were. Everything from just below my knees was gone.


‚ÄúCome on let‚Äôs get you chained back up,‚Äù Mike said while undoing the arm straps.


‚ÄúNo needles this time?‚Äù I asked him sarcastically.


‚ÄúPlanning on running away?‚Äù He asked while returning the same sarcastic tone before letting out a sickening laugh. He then picked me up, and tossed me over his shoulder. As he was walking me back over to the chains, I saw that he had an old pocket knife tucked in his back pocket. I reached for it, and luckily my arms were just long enough. I managed to grab it and drive it into the back of Mike's neck. I fell and hit the ground hard after Mike dropped me. He stumbled for a second before finally hitting the ground as well. His clothes were soaked in blood, and I couldn‚Äôt tell how much was mine or his. Mike leaned up against the concrete slab before showing me his eyes, which were now filled with rage.


‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù He yelled in between spitting up blood. Eventually, his words became nothing more than bloody gurgling, and then his body went limp. I crawled to the barn doors and was barely able to get one of them open. I managed to make it to the mobile home before finding my cellphone in his nightstand. I called the police and told them the address, which I found off a piece of mail sitting on the coffee table. I sat on the floor in his room until the police finally busted down the front door. Two officers rushed in and lifted me up before carrying me outside. Two paramedics met them, and they took care of me from there. The whole ride in the back of the ambulance, all I could think about was what would happen if Mike had some evidence of what we were planning together. After they got me to the hospital, they cleaned my wounds and redid the stitches. A few hours went by and an officer walked into my room.


‚ÄúHow are you doing son?‚Äù The officer asked.


‚ÄúI could be better,‚Äù I said before letting out a grown from the pain.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for asking. Anyway, I‚Äôm Detective Harrington,‚Äù he responded, ‚Äúand I wanted to ask you about the man who did this while your memory is still fresh.‚Äù


I was reluctant, but I knew he was probably right. ‚ÄúSure, what do you need to know?‚Äù


‚ÄúDo you remember what happened when he abducted you?‚Äù


‚ÄúIt was while I was walking out to my car a few days ago.‚Äù I lied hoping he would buy it.


‚ÄúAnd do you remember where this happened?‚Äù He asked.


‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I lied again, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember much of what happened before waking up in the barn. He stuck me in the neck with something and I was out.‚Äù


‚ÄúOkay, okay and did the perpetrator ever mention anything about his parents, or maybe a woman by the name of Emily [Redacted]. Detective Harrington asked.


‚ÄúHe told me they died a few years back, but not much else, and I don‚Äôt know an Emily [Redacted]. Who is she?‚Äù I asked.


He scratched his beard and finished writing in his notes before saying, ‚ÄúWe think she was who he was targeting next. She‚Äôs just some waitress at a local diner, but you don‚Äôt need to worry about those details.‚Äù


‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôm positive son. You just get some rest. We‚Äôll we can continue after you get a little better‚Äù He said before stepping back out.


After a few days in the hospital, the doctors saw me fit to go home and I was wheeled out to my father‚Äôs car. He thanked the nurse for wheeling me out before he loaded me into his car. On the way home, he tried talking to me and asked me questions about what had happened, but I didn‚Äôt answer. I stared out the window not saying a word. After he figured out I wasn‚Äôt up for talking, we finished the ride in silence. When we pulled into the driveway, he helped me inside and laid me down in the guest bedroom. While lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling not blinking or uttering a word. I could feel pain in my legs that weren‚Äôt there. I hated the bastard for what he did to me. I felt betrayed by someone who I thought was becoming my friend. By someone just like me. I guess it‚Äôs for the best though. Now nobody has to worry about what I could do anymore.",6,1751156289.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

I already own and love FS Lola and FS Love Flight of a Candy Heart, which are both gourmands with citrus notes and hints of pink pepper. (I've also purchased The Beautiful and the Damned in a rollerball recently, and this one gets me the most compliments of the three, but I'm not sure if it's exactly ""me."" Y'know?)

While citrusy gourmands may be my favorites, I'm also interested in branching out a little (i.e., lavender, coffee, opium, herbs...). This is because I'm about to graduate and pursue professional librarianship positions, and I might not want to smell like candy in a library/professional setting. Maybe dark academia notes like paper and ink are the move from here?

Fragrances I'm strongly considering: **Honored Ghosts** (I love rosewater and Earl Grey tea), **Haunted and Bewitched** (same, plus the caramel and pink pepper notes make it seem perfect for me!), and **Novella** (more Earl Grey, plus the paperback notes!)

Also on the table: **Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure** (because of the incense, caramel-y, bergamot, and lemon notes), **Silken Tent** (just because of its popularity), or maybe even Surcie, Carnival of Illustrious Hearts, or Calliope (although I'm leaning against it); experimentally: **Infamous Muse** (curious about the opium and cacao), **The Raven** (I've heard interesting things about it), **Sigil** (incense, coffee, opium, honey, citrus, and herbs seems like a fun combination)",5,1751155917.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

I have10+ years of project management experience, but none of it in agile or in traditional PM industries like tech or construction. I studied for about two months start to finish. Here's what worked for me:

1. Did the Andrew Ramdayal Udemy course (started it April 29, finished June 3rd). I actually mostly paid attention to it, though sometimes it was just running in the background. I did terribly on all of the quizzes and tests in the course. So that was 35 hours, $20.

2. Signed up for the PMI membership ($149) and signed up for/ scheduled the test ($425) 

3. Read through PMBOK guide - this was probably the least useful thing that I did, and I didn't re-read anything (2 hours? 4 hours? I'm not sure)

4. Watched the 23 Mindset Principles video and mostly paid attention (2 hours, I'm not great with long videos).

5. Bought PMI Study Hall Essentials ($49) on June 16th and studied exclusively from that for two weeks. I did all 700 practice questions and the two exams (got 77% on both). I did some of the content stuff, particularly when I had struggled with the questions, but I didn't get through all of it. When I got a question wrong, I tried to follow the links in the explanation and read the paper or article. I might have spent another 25 hours here, but it was definitely the best use of my time.

I took the test at home on Friday just at my dining room table. The proctor wanted to make sure that I had nothing on the table (other than my coffee and water), but otherwise, didn't say much. Most of the questions were easier than Study Hall and several of the answer choices would be just very wrong. I had some drag and drops, but nothing tricky. A few questions were hard, and I probably got them wrong, but overall, I felt good and finished quickly. Found out my result this afternoon, so yay!

Good luck to everyone still studying!",6,1751155883.0,pmp,3,1.0,False

Okay, friends, let‚Äôs get real for a second. Life can sometimes feel like that never-ending to-do list, right? You know, the one that‚Äôs doing its best impression of a hydra ‚Äì cut off one task, and two more pop up in its place! üò± 

Imagine if you could wave a magic wand and *poof* one thing in your life was just‚Ä¶automated. What would you pick? 

Here's what I‚Äôm thinking:

- **Grocery Shopping**: I mean, who actually enjoys wandering through aisles trying to remember if we‚Äôre out of toothpaste or if last week‚Äôs avocado is still kicking? Picture a grocery delivery service that just knows what you eat and brings it to your door. *Heaven!*

- **Morning Routine**: Why can‚Äôt we automate getting out of bed? Every morning, I swear my alarm is in cahoots with my cozy blanket. I‚Äôd love a personal assistant who literally pulls me out of bed and brews my coffee at the same time. That‚Äôs multitasking but without the effort!

- **Email Sorting**: Do I need to explain this one? If I had a robo-human to sift through my emails and summarize the important stuff, I‚Äôd finally know if that ‚Äúurgent‚Äù message from my friend really needs my immediate attention or if it can wait until mid-afternoon snack time. üç™

- **Decision-Making**: You know those moments where you spend way too long deciding on what to have for dinner or whether to binge-watch a series or hit the gym? I‚Äôd fully automate choice fatigue. *Somebody just tell me what to do!*

Okay, so yeah, we can‚Äôt automate everything (yet) but imagine the mental space we could free up! Think about it: less time spent on mundane tasks means more time for things you *actually* care about. 

And the best part? You get to direct that newfound energy into creative projects, hobbies, or just chilling with your friends. üôå 

So what about you? If you could put just one task on autopilot, what would it be? Are you with me on the grocery shopping? Or do you have other things weighing you down? Let‚Äôs spill the beans!",1,1751155628.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I got really sick earlier this year with either covid or influenza and developed parosmia. 
It started with coffee, that tasted and smelled like a mix of dirt and rotten potatoes, and then it spread to things like shampoo and oven baked food, which all smelled the same as coffee.
About a week or two of getting better, the parosmia went away.

Now, 5 months after I got better, I think it came back, but it's only affecting fruit. Everything smells the same, like fermented fruit maybe? It's not a pleasant smell and I found that it's worse with strawberries.

Has anyone here experienced anything like this before? As far as I knew, parosmia didn't affect fruit, and it's weird that it suddenly came back. What can I do to make it go away again?

1ln14ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ln14ko/anxiety_about_driving/,Anxiety about driving,"Hi everyone,

I have a lot of general anxiety but something I‚Äôve been struggling with most for the last few years has been driving. I frankly have a ton of anxiety about driving, and I feel like it‚Äôs holding me back. It‚Äôs not something I really discuss with anybody since I find it pretty embarrassing. 

To paint a quick picture: I don‚Äôt really do a whole lot driving. I drive to the bus station to take a bus into the city for work, and when I‚Äôm off I do drive a short distance to my local coffee shop. I‚Äôll also drive to the barber shop every few weeks. However, I still live at home, so my parents go grocery shopping every week, and other than that I don‚Äôt really have other reasons to get in my car during the week. 

The roads I do drive on are very simple, lots of single lane roads with a fairly low speed limit. I have only driven on the highway a couple of times since I got my license, and there‚Äôs so much about larger multi-lane roadways that I get really anxious about driving on. Lane changes, faster speeds, cars passing around me, getting exists and exit lanes confused, etc. 

I also get a lot of anxiety because there‚Äôs so much that can go wrong so easily. I get so worried and stressed about making mistakes. I also worry about if I‚Äôm not doing something correctly, If I‚Äôm driving incorrectly or impeding others. 

I really hate that I need to absolutely force myself to get in my car and drive if I need to go somewhere. I get so anxious about. It knowing where I‚Äôm going, if I‚Äôll find parking, if I can make it to my destination without issue, and so many other things that run through my mind. It‚Äôs also gotten to the pin t where I‚Äôm so set in my routine that I‚Äôm only really comfortable driving on roads I drive on every week. Roads I‚Äôm unfamiliar with kind of terrify the hell out of me. ",2,1751155412.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

1ln144m,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1ln144m/incredibly_rude_but_wont_stop_trying_to_be/,Incredibly Rude but Won't Stop Trying to be Friends with Me???,"I have a much younger roommate who is the apex of a 'basic bitch.' This bothers me aesthetically and philosophically, but in and of itself doesn't make me dislike her because I have plenty of reality-TV watching, pumpkin spice-flavoured friends who wear riding boots even though they've never touched a horse. I like them, they like me, we connect on what we connect on and give each other space to like different things. 

The issue with the roommate comes in with the fact that she reacts rudely- at best checking out disinterestedly, at worst eye-rolling and trash-talking with her baby Karen friends who are all carbon copies of her whenever I mention anything that I'm interested in, am watching or listening to, etc. It's not just what I like- a third roommate who moved out tried to place some of her alt-friendly objets d'art in the common area, and she HID them in the cupboards, and kept doing that, despite the fact that she decorated said common area without any of our permission- including with an actual, literal ""Live Laugh Love"" sign on the wall. She refers to anything outside of her incrediby narrow frame of reference as ""strange"" and ""weird."" At least a number of her closer friends are people who have never evolved past their middle-school bully phase despite being grown adults in their 20s, and while she insists on being treated like she is a kind person because she's polite in a kind of rural Southern way, she happily participates in their riducule of vulnerable or traumatised persons. 

The other issue is that she is the most boring person alive. If you think I'm being rude now, I DARE YOU to try to hold a longer than 10 min conversation with her. Imagine someone who is permanently stoned, and you will start to comprehend the level of cognitive faculty she appears to operate out of 100% of the time- but I know she is never high because marijuana (and all substances) scares her.  She has not in so many months, and does not seem capable of thought that a child under 10 could not fully comprehend. *I feel I must emphasize that this is not an exaggeration. I can not be being any more expositional-* which is what she is, all the time, exclusively, and always only about the most minute details of incredibly mundane things. She doesn't TEND to be this way- she only speaks this way all the time. I feel I have to repeat, because no one believes me until they witness it themselves, that this is not an exaggeration.

Myself and Roomie 3 took all of this in stride, because at least she cleans up after herself, and it's a temporary situation. But ever since Roomie 3 announced their move, she has been trying to arrange movie nights, shopping excursions, inviting me to hangouts, etc., etc., all while continuing to be condescending. I am reacting increasingly curtly and negatively, because it's every damn day, every time I see her. 

I can't tell if this is what she actually thinks or not, but it feels like in her tone that she is implying that I must really, deep down, want to be initiated into her aesthetic and lifestlye, that people who aren't ""basic bitch"" girlies don't have individual, personal reasons for liking what they already like, and are just sad that they've failed to become normies. But this would really blow my mind, because I have no frame of reference for someone continuing to think in these terms past high-school. Every 'basic bitch' I've ever known has a solid grasp on the fact that huge percentages of the rest of the populace not only have differing sensbilities, but often actually find their taste vapid, and overall less than satisfactory. And these other basic, normie types often even have a sense of humour about it.

I am obviously irritated, as this has been going on for almost a month now, but more than anything I'm just really confused! Who, apart from grade-school boys with a crush on someone, tries to make this many overtures of connection to someone they're so often rude to?

My questions-

1. What am I supposed to do? I have always been a fight, rather than a flight person, and so it's far more likely that I'm going to snap at some point and tell her exactly what I think, before I lose the will to live, and I'd really like to avoid that. Even if she's annoying, it feels wrong to do that to someone that far my junior. I would have thought that after 4 weeks of making excuses, she'd stop trying. I'm genuinely considering just sitting her down, buying her a coffee and telling her outright that I don't like her company, because whatever awkwardness ensued after that could not be worse than this everyday onslaught.

2. Can anyone give me any clue as to why someone who's so rude to me is also so desperate to connect? Is there a Gen Z/Alpha thing that I'm missing? Maybe if I understood wtf was going on, I would know how to approach it easier.",2,1751155375.0,badroommates,3,1.0,False

1ln0zg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ln0zg8/why_do_some_people_use_multiple_reddit_accounts/,"Why do some people use multiple Reddit accounts to harass, insult, and attack people online?","This all started because I made a post in r/AITA about an older man in a coffee shop harassing and insulting me and I retorted back to defend myself. The overwhelming majority of people said I am not the asshole and the old man was way out of line.

This random man online, however, accused me of faking the story as some weird fantasy and posted it to r/thathappened, where I‚Äôve been attacked and accused of making up a fake harassment story for‚Ä¶attention? He then used these 2 accounts (you can see that they are the same person since he follows and posts in all the same Reddit groups and writes posts/comments on the same exact topics, including baseball cards, elderly cats, living in California, and r/thathappened) to obsessively attack me. He followed me to a group where I posted about going through a diagnostic process for autism and mocked me over there, then falsely accused me of making up/faking my disability and being a woman of color in order to be a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. He called me names (several of his comments were removed because they violated Reddit‚Äôs hate and harassment guidelines), insulted me about my age (even though he‚Äôs older than me), called me pathetic, and has harassed, followed, and gaslit me for days. He also said some really psychopathic and borderline scary stuff about how much he enjoys ‚Äúmaking me squirm‚Äù.

So he has been obsessively harassing me because he claims my story about harassment must be fake. The irony of this is laughable. I will block him soon, but part of me is fascinated by what causes people to behave this way and also wants to expose him. Why do people do this?? What kind of psychology drives these men to obsessively hate women this much?",0,1751154993.0,self,5,0.33,False
1ln0za2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1ln0za2/a_family_member_is_moving_to_slc_for_the_first/,A family member is moving to SLC for the first time and I‚Äôm creating a Giftcard passport for them to give them excuses to explore different neighborhoods. Can you help add any ideas or critique mine?,"I'm going to create a custom passport book for them and include gift cards (about $10 each) so they can be excited to explore Utah and salt lake!

I've decided to segment the ""passport"" into neighborhoods and want to include quintessential Utah things to do and places to eat/drink/shop in each neighborhood, I'm thinking of doing 5-10 things per area, not designed to all be done in one day or quickly, maybe it could even be a thing that takes a whole year to do.

So far my initial ideas are

Liberty-Wells Area
* The Park Cafe Giftcard (dog friendly they have a dog)
* liberty park across the street (free)
* Tracy Aviary ticket (probably can't bring dogs but hey another excuse to head here!)
* Coffee garden Giftcard
* cahoots Giftcard
* dolcetto gelato Giftcard 

Sugarhouse Area
* Millie's gift card
* central book exchange gift card (or have free sprague branch library card sign up task to self stamp passport)
* Sugarhouse coffee gift card
* Sugarhouse park (free)
* The soup kitchen gift card
* raunch records gift card (or have free vintage store exploration since there are several here)
* visit the D.I. (Free)

Emigration Canyon Area
* hogle zoo ticket
* this is the place ticket
* ruths diner gift card
* little dell (free)
* rebutte garden ticket
* Utah natural history ticket 

Downtown area
* red iguana gift card
* brewvies gift card
* the pie underground gift card 

Southern Utah
* will probably get them tickets to some national parks and/or a free night at a hotel in Moab or St. George for a weekend trip, haven't really fleshed this one out yet. 

Anyone have any other ideas (including free stuff in the related neighborhoods!) I was also thinking of including ""side quests"" with iconic things to see. Like historical signs or monuments (you know the signs the ones we all remember, like the costume store one on 1300, or the plumber one on 33rd lol)

The reason for me having sex only a handful of times is self image issues, depression, shyness, and most important of all is that I‚Äôm in a country where it‚Äôs illegal (yay for Islam).

I just had my latest ‚Äúintimate‚Äù experience and I feel like a robot.

Kisses felt only like wet lips touching. Touches generated zero buzz or excitement. I look into his eyes and I feel nothing, like I‚Äôm out of my body. Not sure how to explain it but everything felt unsexual.

My first time I was forcing myself to hookup to lose my virginity. I couldn‚Äôt finish.

Another experience was with someone extremely attractive, I thought maybe I had a high standard and only a gorgeous guy will work for me, I was feeling the ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù just thinking about having sex with him. But the actual encounter ended up feeling like the others and I struggled to finish.

For this last encounter I thought I needed a connection beforehand, we went for coffee first and we had similar backgrounds (fellow countryman, unlike the previous ones which were all westerners). The following days I was very excited thinking about having sex with him, feeling buzz or passion just thinking about it. But it ended up like my previous experiences when we hooked up, it felt kind of unsexual. I was erect but not much else, and I struggled to finish.

All the guys had no issues finishing. And they tried to help me finish. And most wanted to meet again.

Not sure if it‚Äôs porn addiction (though I rarely watch porn recently), a mental block, anxiety, shyness, mental health issues, sexual dysfunction, or maybe I just met them while not in the mood, and my exciting fantasies beforehand were me in the mood.

1ln0x1k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ln0x1k,"First impressions on 114 fragrances, including ATH, Amouage, Louis Vuitton, Mind Games, Parfums de Marly, Roja Parfums, √âtat Libre d'Orange and more (Part 1/2)","My biggest sample hauls arrived this week and now it's time to give my unwanted opinions. Due to the sheer amount of samples I'm splitting this post into two parts, with the second part with the missing 52 samples being posted tomorrow night.

Obviously I didn't try these all back to back in one sitting, I tried them all out in small batches over the span of a few days. 

**ATH Hard Candy √âlixir** - Extremely sweet (duh it's called Hard **Candy**), very vanillic, a bit fruity and minty, definitely gives me JPG vibes, this is definitely in the Le Male DNA. Not blown away off first impressions but it smells good. 8.5/10

It sucks that getting samples of Aaron's fragrances is quite difficult and that the decants for them are so expensive, so you kind of have to resort to blind buying his fragrances to try them out to get a much better value for your money. HCE makes me very excited to receive all the other ATHs I've ordered, these being Ozone, Addicted, Notorious, Raw Cherry, Tabac Extreme and Supersonic.

**Maison Francis Kurkdjian Grand Soir** - A bit scented candle-like, quite potent, very vanillic and aromatic with sweetness/creaminess from tonka bean and some resins. There's also a touch of orange in the opening but it fades quickly. Very nice. 8.5/10

**Initio Power Self** - Light and airy flowers and musks. Smells like an air freshener. Definitely feminine leaning too. Very disappointing and the worst Initio I've tried, but not terrible overall. 6/10

**Mind Games**

‚Ä¢ *Grand Master* - Immediately smells like rose in the air. Ambery rose with a tiny hint of coffee. Very unisex. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Gardez* - It does smell like popcorn on paper. It's mostly popcorn with a bit of woods and a slight fruitiness. Kind of weird but not bad, it actually kind of works well. 7.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Scholar's Mate* - Smells minty in the air. Very apparent fig and sandalwood, reminds me of Gris Charnel. There's some freshness and spiciness to it as well, also a tiny hint of citrus rounding out the scent. Pretty nice. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Double Attack* - Very well blended, can't pick out any particular notes. There's some citruses and a sweet and creamy layer underneath. There's also something kind of sharp and metallic that might be the agave note with the pimento. Also nice. 7.5/10

‚Ä¢ *J'Adoube* - Fruity and floral in the air, smells like something my sister has. Up close this is a fruit bomb, very nice and sweet. None of the base notes are apparent in the opening at all. This might lean feminine because of how bright and fruity it is. My mom was a big fan of this one. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Ch…õckmate* - Very rosey in the air just like Grand Master, but Ch…õckmate is bright and fizzy compared to darker and earthier. Up close there's an instantly recognizable patchouli √† la Tom Ford Noir. This strong patchouli earthiness keeps the scent unisex. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Ca√Øssa* - Very well made white florals, this one probably wouldn't give me a headache. Quite musky and with a bit of licorice and spice. Nice but feminine for sure. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *As-suli's Diamond* - I thought this would be much worse based on people's reactions to it but it's not that bad. The resins and florals make for a weird combination but this seems to be one of those scents where you have to smell the trail it leaves instead of smelling it up close. 7/10

‚Ä¢ *Blockade* - This does smell very close to Aventus, which is very odd considering the listed notes. This smells just like Aventus's mossy, woody citruses. Pretty surprising to be honest. I do like the Aventus DNA a lot so it's going to bias my score but I don't care. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Castling* - Oddly enough it smells a bit like coconut. Fruity, a bit powdery and woody, it kind of makes me think of the beach for some reason. I like this a lot. 9/10

Mind Games was a huge surprise because I didn't expect to like their scents as much as I did, at least off first impressions. I was expecting to feel lukewarm or outright dislike most of their fragrances, but, even though I wouldn't own many of them, they're still worth sampling as I find them to be relatively unique. As of writing this I already received a sample of Mentor (which will be in tomorrow's post) and have a sample of Opera Mate on the way. I'm definitely buying the Soulmate Collection set soon.

**Amouage**

‚Ä¢ *Opus XV King Blue* - Sweet and fruity in the air. I can see why people say this smells like a barnyard or fecal, but surprisingly it doesn't seem that strong. There's also a lot of patchouli here, and the combination of it, the oud and the fruitiness make for an interesting scent. This is definitely going to be a challenging wear, but I do like it a lot. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Interlude Black Iris Man* - Green scent, prominent violet in the air. It smells quite green and resinous to me, not what I was expecting. The iris isn't that apparent on paper, more so the violet and myrrh. Will have to test more. Doesn't smell bad at all though. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Enclave* - Very sweet, minty and even vanillic in the air. Up close it's extremely well blended, I can't pick up any particular notes other than the peppermint and a slight hint of cinnamon and cardamom. Smells very nice but to be completely honest it reminds me a bit of toothpaste. Totally unisex. Looking forward to trying it out. 8.5/10

**Louis Vuitton**

‚Ä¢ *L'Immensit√©* - I remember this being an unpleasant ginger bomb, but it's a good aquatic grapefruit fragrance in the opening. However, there's an unpleasant note that starts to come out as the scent dries, and I find it a bit repulsive. I'll definitely have to try carefully. 5/10

‚Ä¢ *Fleur du D√©sert* - Could immediately pick it up in the air and it smells very feminine. Super strong white florals and rose with a bit of honey and only a tiny hint of oud. Same oud as Les Sables Roses and Ombre Nomade, but very subdued and barely noticeable, like it's hiding at the back of the fragrance. Not bad but I can't wear this at all. 7/10

‚Ä¢ *Nouveau Monde* - I don't r…õally get much other than oud and a slight nondescript sweetness here. I seriously can't pick up anything else. Will have to see how this does on skin. It also seems to get very weak on paper quickly. Disappointing. 5/10

**Clive Christian**

‚Ä¢ *Jump Up And Kiss Me Hedonistic* - This one I wore without trying it first. It's like you took Blonde Amber and replaced the dried fruits and booze with a cherry liquor. It also doesn't project as much. Not bad at all but I much prefer Blonde Amber. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Jump Up And Kiss Me Ecstatic* - Love the deep orange color of the juice. Generic white florals scent with an off putting syrupy note. I know this is gonna be headache inducing for me. Totally feminine scent. I don't like this. 3/10

‚Ä¢ *X N√©roli* - Smells r…õally bad. The citruses and prominent neroli were done very badly here, it's no surprise this is long discontinued. This also smells nothing like the or√≠ginal X for Men. 2/10

‚Ä¢ *1872 Mandarin* - There's an added soapiness here that doesn't work at all. I think the basil and coriander are what's giving the scent a sharp edge that's a bit weird. Doesn't hold a candle to the or√≠ginal 1872. It also makes me think of Kilian's Vodka on the Rocks but that's a far better fragrance too. 4/10

With these 4 fragrances I have tried a total of 18 Clive Christians, worn most of them, and can say they're a good house, but they're definitely not unique or good enough to justify the prices they charge. Performance on most of them is also just alright. If you want to get into Clive Christian my recommendations are Blonde Amber/Hedonistic, Timeless, Contemporary, Iconic Masculine and 1872 Masculine. I'd also recommend Matsukita but I don't have a sample of that, I only tried it in store once, but it's also great.

**Memo Paris**

‚Ä¢ *Moroccan Leather* - Aromatic and floral scent. It's extremely similar to Irish Leather but a bit more polished, that one just smells like cucumber. Still not a big fan. 6/10

‚Ä¢ *Russian Leather* - Very green and aromatic scent, definitely foug√®re/barbershop in style. Much like most Memo Leather fragrances, there isn't a leather note here. Smells very good though. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Sicilian Leather* - Extremely r…õalistic salty lemon smell. Heavy citruses with spices, a bit aromatic too. Makes me think of fruit with salt and lemon. There is a hint of a classic foug√®re/barbershop scent underneath that, though, and I like that part of the scent a lot but it's not prominent enough. 6.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Shams Oud* - Strong oud with a hint of saffron's sweet spiciness but not much more. Gonna have to try it on skin, seems to be the same case as Nouveau Monde. 7/10

**Parfums de Marly**

‚Ä¢ *Altha√Ør* - White flowers-like, sweet, vanillic, maybe a hint of almonds. I expected it to be a ""warmer"" scent, so to speak. Altha√Ør also makes me think of a scented candle. Pretty underwhelmed but it's not bad at all. It is grossly overhyped though. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Carlisle* - Very strong chocolatey patchouli. It's a note that's very predominant to my nose so it's drowning out everything else. There's also something slightly animalic/BO-ish in the back of the scent. I do like it though and I can see why people say this smells like a rich man, this is a much more mature scent. 7/10

‚Ä¢ *Galloway* - Smells very familiar but I can't put my finger on what fragrance this reminds me of. Peppery, soapy citruses. Not a fan. It's also a bit fizzy like Sedley but overall it's a much worse scent. 5/10

‚Ä¢ *Godolphin* - Leather with a very slight fruity sweetness. I've only tried Tuscan Leather very briefly and this seems smoother in comparison. I'll have to see if this doesn't smell like petroleum on my skin. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Herod* - A bit powdery in the air. Very weak on paper but I can smell a bit of vanilla and cinnamon. I'm pretty sure I'm nose blind to Iso E Super so it might be why I find it very weak. I'll have to try on skin. No score

With these PDMs I've now tried 15 of their fragrances and, for the most part, fresh fragrances aren't their strong suit, their heavier scents are. I have yet to receive a sample of Castley, but it alone can't tip over the balance towards fresh fragrances. My recommendations from this house (off first impressions) are both Laytons, Pegasus Exclusif, Altha√Ør and Godolphin.

**Frederic Malle**

‚Ä¢ *Portrait of a Lady* - Lipsticky rose in the air, reminds me of Oud Satin Mood's rose. Up close there's some earthiness from patchouli but it's blended excellently. This is an excellent rose fragrance, not feminine or feminine leaning at all. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *French Lover* - Woody and slightly musky with a strong and present green accord. Unfortunately I think I became nose blind instantly as I couldn't smell a thing after the first whiff, which is a shame. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Rose & Cuir* - Weird green rose scent with a paint chemical sharpness to it, same sharpness I smelled in Music for a While but much stronger. There's also no leather at all here. This doesn't smell good. 3/10

‚Ä¢ *Promise* - Rosey and fruity in the air. There's a powdery and fruity woodiness here, but once again I smell that same chemical sharpness. It's not as strong as in Rose & Cuir and the rest of the scent smells better but I'm still not a fan. 4/10

I've lost interest in Frederic Malle completely. Portrait of a Lady is excellent but the other scents I've tried that don't smell like paint are just good enough to not make me regret buying the samples, but not enough to make me even want to wear them.

**Roja Parfums**

‚Ä¢ *Apex Eau de Parfum* - Soft and juicy pineapple with musk, perhaps a hint of mandarin orange. At least on paper there's no frankincense or leather at all. It becomes mossier after a while, which makes me think of the Aventus DNA just a tiny bit. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Vetiver Eau de Parfum* - Very similar vetiver note to Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver, but rounded out with citruses. Not that strong on paper. 7.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Elysium Eau de Parfum* - Grapefruit with some green and floral notes that make me think of chamomille tea for some reason. Super weak on paper once again. Definitely has an aquatic feel to it. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Enigma Eau de Parfum* - Immediately made me think of Vanilla Coke. Slight citrus with a powdery, rosey base. There's a hint of cognac here but it's like they completely removed the alcohol and left the rest of the drink's smell. Very interesting, but also a bit odd that this is in a ""summer selection"" discovery set, this is much better suited for fall-winter and the cooler parts of spring. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Oceania Eau de Parfum* - Smells like well blended citruses and florals. Also aquatic like Elysium. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Danger Eau de Parfum* - The woody-vanilla-patchouli here makes me think of aftershave/a barbershop. A bit aromatic and citrusy too on top of that base. It's nice. 8/10

Roja's naming convention is very weird, so I think all of these are the ones that have ""Parfum Cologne"" in their name. Overall I'm pretty surprised by these fresh fragrances, I'm glad I picked up this set despite not being the biggest fan of Burlington 1819 when I got a travel spray of that.

**√âtat Libre d'Orange**

‚Ä¢ *Archives 69* - Smells very familiar. Definitely very camphorous and spicy, but these notes faded almost instantly. The fruit notes are nice. It leans a bit feminine to my nose. 7/10

‚Ä¢ *Clean Suede* - I sprayed this accidentally trying to pry it out and some ended on my hand. The suede note is noticeable on skin, it's totally missing on paper. It's a very nice scent, the vanilla with the soapiness from the aldehydes and the mild citruses smell like the name implies, like clean suede. I like this one a lot actually. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Divin'Enfant* - The sample leaked unfortunately.

‚Ä¢ *Eau de Protection* - Rose with orange and ginger, not much more than that. A bit flat. 6/10

‚Ä¢ *Exit The King* - Very soapy, musky and clean, makes me think of fresh laundry. It's nice but a bit meh, the name doesn't fit it at all. 7.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Fat Electrician* - I can't smell anything other than a light vanilla. No score

‚Ä¢ *Hermann √† mes C√¥t√©s me Paraissait une Ombre* - Smells weird. Can't make out what it smells like at all. It's watery but also slightly mineralic. Not a fan. 4/10

‚Ä¢ *Like This* - Very herbal and I can kind of see why pumpkin is listed as a note. Odd that the sweet accord appears at the top in Fragrantica, this doesn't smell sweet at all. 6/10

‚Ä¢ *Sous Le Pont Mirabeau* - Aquatic with mild citruses and a tiny bit ozonic. 6/10

‚Ä¢ *Remarkable People* - Very nice bright and fizzy grapefruit scent. Definitely on the better side of these fragrances. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Putain des Palaces* - Powdery and musky violet. Soft and nice but a bit feminine. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Ghost In The Shell* - Smells very clean and musky, definitely lactonic but that's more noticeable up close than in the air. I don't know if this could end up smelling funky after a while though, but at least the opening is good. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *She Was An Anomaly* - Powdery, musky, a bit fruity and sandalwoody. There's a store at a local mall that smells like this. I like this too but it's a bit feminine as well. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *You Or Someone Like You* - Very minty and green, some rounding citruses. Pretty fresh and nice. There's a slight chemical undertone but it could be my smell receptors being tired from the excessive testing. This reminds me a lot of Torino21, I think if you like the Xerjoff you'll like this. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Experimentum Crucis* - A better version of I Am Trash, it's mostly apple and rose. The slight spice and patchouli do wonders for the scent. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Frustration* - Very vanillic with chestnut and a hint cinnamon. This is definitely a gourmand scent. Like a better version of Gentleman Reserve Priv√©e to me because it gets rid of the buttery orris. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Soul Of My Soul* - A bit citrusy, can't pick out the notes well. Smells nice though. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Spice Must Flow* - Great rose scent with a bit of cardamom. There isn't any note keeping it from being feminine leaning unfortunately. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *500 Years* - Classic rose oud scent that's a bit powdery and lipsticky. I like that powderiness. 8/10

I didn't expect a lot of these to be wearable based on the notes, more so just quirky experimental scents, but many of these aren't even likeable enough to be interesting. I do commend ELDO for being an insanely creative house but they miss the mark with a lot of their more experimental scents. They do have great fragrances as you can see from my scores, but the scent profiles for most of them are more ""mundane"".

This concludes Part 1. Part 2 will include *a lot* of Nishane and Argos, and some more Louis Vuitton, Mind Games, Amouage and other brands not seen here.",9,1751154789.0,Colognes,3,1.0,False

Have of course made thousands of lattes/cappacinos but never at a coffee shop so I can do them just fine just not nearly as well as a barista of course. Anyways hoping for an interview

For those of you who are trans (I‚Äôm FTM) how has the insurance worked out for you? How long does it take to kick in/about how much a month do you have to pay? Did you have trouble taking recovery time off for surgeries and how does that work insurance wise since you need to work 20hrs/wk. 

Also at the interview when they ask me why I want to work at Starbucks do I just straight up tell them? I feel like it‚Äôll be obvious since I‚Äôm trans and already have a job that I like and will be continuing to work at. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll quit in two months or anything even though I would just be there for the surgeries

Got my hair touched up with some chocolate brownie and dark brunette highlights ‚Äî total fall goddess vibes. Then I slid into a hydrating facial, wax, and lash refill like the beauty queen I am.
My girl Rosa snapped, per usual. Not only does she always put me back together, but she hit me with the salon tea and work gossip. I left that chair feeling like me again.
She even took pictures of me for her page, so go ahead and say it ‚Äî cover girl.

After that, obviously I had to stop at Target so the world could witness the new hair.
Then I spent the day casually texting the finance bro I matched with. He‚Äôs 25 ‚Äî almost 3 years older than me, which feels like the right amount of mature-but-still-fun. He‚Äôs actually kind of funny? I‚Äôm meeting him for coffee tomorrow afternoon so‚Ä¶ wish me luck and send your first date tip energy. üôè

Got ready for work with a light makeup beat (we‚Äôre not allowed to go full glam, RIP), threw on my clip-on tie and vest‚Ä¶
AND I GOT A NEW VEST at lineup because my old one was too big. Translation: the gym is working. Three workouts a week and I‚Äôm officially getting snatched.

I had a section that was set to turn about 30 guests total, but my last 4-top canceled. Not mad though ‚Äî it gave me more time to chill with my regulars, who are honestly the highlight of my shift. One of them gave me a tiny little Jesus squishing today.
They must know I need him. üòá

One table didn‚Äôt tell me they didn‚Äôt like their food until after they ate the entire plate.
Like‚Ä¶ sir???
You licked it clean, and now you want a discount?

But shoutout to my manager who straight-up told him,
‚ÄúYou ate it, so I‚Äôm not taking it off. That‚Äôs stealing.‚Äù
HE‚ÄôS A REAL ONE! 

Thank God for auto-gratuity because without it, that man would‚Äôve left me $2 and a passive-aggressive nod.

After tip-out, I walked out with $659.
So now it‚Äôs time to roll this new hair up in rollers and get my beauty sleep because I‚Äôm lowkey nervous for tomorrow‚Äôs coffee date.

Pray for my social skills, and for the finance bro to be cuter in person. ü•≤",1,1751154746.0,u_theserverdiaries,0,1.0,False

1ln0uza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Babysitting/comments/1ln0uza/not_sure_if_i_should_cancel/,Not sure if I should cancel,"To preface, I‚Äôve been babysitting for over 10 years and nannying for about 5-6 years now. I have lots of infant and toddler experience. 

Someone was coming into town for a few weeks and looking for a sitter a few different dates over the couple weeks and we connected  almost a month ago and confirmed 4 different days and times for me to sit for her toddler and infant. 

Today I was schedule to be there for 3 hours, the first 30-40 minutes were more so introductions with the parents and hearing about them and their routine. 

The parents then left after that and I was alone with the kids for about 2-2.25 hours. 

Like I said, I have a LOT of experience with the ages of their kids and have dealt with difficult children. But today was MISERABLE. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to make it through the full 2ish hours. It almost felt like I wasn‚Äôt able to keep the toddler safe. He did not sit down for 1 minute and no joke the entire time all he wanted to do was jump on the coffee table, jump on the skinny couch, spin until he was so dizzy he kept falling over and I had to keep blocking him from falling and hitting his head. I caught him from falling multiple times, and trust me I was watching him like a hawk he just is very quick and chaotic. 

To make it worse, they‚Äôre in town from another country so they‚Äôre in a rental house for a few weeks. meaning I didn‚Äôt have like an established space or safe spot to put the toddler when he was being so crazy to deal with the newborn etc. I can‚Äôt explain how or why but it was SO BAD today. When the parents got home they both took a screaming child and neither of them could calm them down either. 

I‚Äôm supposed to go back in the morning for 4 hours. I genuinely don‚Äôt know if I can and would love advice/if I should cancel or not and how i would even cancel. 
Important to note I‚Äôm babysitting for them tomorrow and in 2 Sunday‚Äôs so that they are able to go to church. Of course I‚Äôd love for them to be able to go to church, but it‚Äôs not like they have a mandatory appointment/meeting or something if I couldn‚Äôt make it.

I am so unbelievably unhappy with my living situation. And the more I procrastinate, the worse it becomes. I *KNOOOWWW what I need to do.* I realize what is going the fuck on around me, I am well aware that only \*I\* can fix this situation, but looking at the whole staircase and not just the first step is so overwhelming to me, I just cannot rn. I usually ruminate on my silly little thoughts before I take action... ugh, it is exhausting, so tiring, my hair hurts.

Like Pia for, for instance, has told me on more than one occasion to call her and let her know if I need any sorta help, just let me know, she said, I'll be there. Pia works a stressful job, but who doesn't these days, right? I just do not want to be a burden. I don't wanna ask for help because that'll take time away from her schedule, and I know she likes to have one day on the weekend to totally destress, sorta veg out, do nothing and relax from the stressful week she's had. That is completely normal, healthy behavior!

She has said she knows guys that can dismantle furniture, move to other areas and rebuild if I want, take down the mounted TV set, for example, move the king size bed, fix things, etc..Which is something I sorta overlooked, but is nonetheless important, you moo! I just have to figure it out. I feel like I need to make a list first. I usually have to visualize things before I get the ball rolling. Tomorrow, I am fixed on, set on going downstairs to the storage unit and taking a long look at the damage.. not really damage, I exaggerate.. The stuff that needs to get junked. And lemme tell you, it is quite a bit of stuff mom kept.

When I tell you my mother was a borderline hoarder, I do not make this up. Photographs, our grade school Catholic uniforms, are down there, shit she didn't even know/remember was there, is there! And I know this because I helped her fill that fucxing unit up and try to declutter her bedroom couple years ago... üò© If I tell myself, just start with the other fridge. Just set a timer to 5-10 minutes and in those few minutes, try to see how much you can get rid of, that would be fab. It's a trick ppl you procrastinate do. Annd I don't think it's laziness. I think it goes waaay deeper than that. The loss of my mama.. the aftermath, the what's to come.. yes, I know what I need to do. Shoulda thought of this from day one, but nooooooo.. ugh. Just let me vent, allow me the platform to gather my thoughts, get my shit together, and get a move on, ok? ü•∫

If you have an app idea lurking around and are looking around on how to hire someone on Fiverr or TopTal...I hope this post finds you. 

I‚Äôm not a developer. I work in real estate sales in South Florida ‚Äî the land of unread emails, endless contracts, and clients who think ‚ÄúAS-IS‚Äù means ‚Äúyou‚Äôll fix everything.‚Äù

But a few years ago, I had this idea for a productivity app. I got excited, pitched it to a dev, and was quoted¬†**$25,000**. I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, maybe that‚Äôs just what it costs to build software.‚Äù I went for it. Took on debt. Moved things around. Pushed forward.

It half-worked.  
Literally ‚Äî half done, half tested.  
Then the developer told me he needed¬†**another $25,000**¬†to finish it.

That was the moment.  
The ‚ÄúAre you kidding me?‚Äù moment.  
The ‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll figure it out myself.‚Äù moment.

Enter¬†**Cursor AI.**

I didn‚Äôt have a dev background ‚Äî just grit, caffeine, and way too many Chrome tabs open. But I started learning. Breaking things. Googling error messages like it was a full-time job. And slowly‚Ä¶ I started building.

Today, I‚Äôve launched¬†**BossyEmail**¬†‚Äî a SaaS tool for real estate agents and transaction coordinators that auto-generates contract-related emails (because nobody wants to retype the same ‚ÄúHi, attached please find the executed addendum‚Ä¶‚Äù 47 times a week).

It‚Äôs not perfect.  
It‚Äôs not VC-backed.  
But it‚Äôs¬†**real**, it‚Äôs¬†**live**, and it‚Äôs already saving time for early users. 

**What helped me go from burnt-out to builder:**

* **Cursor AI**¬†‚Äî legit like pairing with a kind, very patient senior dev.
* **Clerk + Stripe + Vercel + OpenAI**¬†‚Äî amazing combo for non-engineers trying to ship something useful.
* **Chunking features**¬†‚Äî I stopped dreaming in unicorns and started building in legos. Just one problem at a time.
* **Being okay with messy**¬†‚Äî the first version wasn‚Äôt cute. It just worked.

**Why I‚Äôm posting:**

* Because someone reading this is sitting on an idea and waiting for ‚Äúthe right developer‚Äù or ‚Äúthe right time.‚Äù Screw that. Start ugly.
* Because the AI tools today make it¬†*shockingly*¬†possible to learn by doing ‚Äî even if you‚Äôve never touched a terminal before.
* Because I wish I had seen a post like this before I wasted $25K and nearly gave up.

I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions about:

* The tech stack I used
* How I handled scope creep (and the debt)
* Pricing, growth, and early user feedback
* What it¬†*actually*¬†felt like to go from founder to accidental dev

Let this be your sign:  
You can build the thing.

  
Even if you're not ""technical.""  
Even if you're tired.  
Even if you‚Äôve been burned before.

I googled here and people were saying they got misdiagnosed with bipolar. (My issue is i;m tracking my mood but can't track a non existent period).

I feel fricking amazing right now top of the world and all. Haven't talked to a psychiatrist partially causeI don't think I need to? I mean I can't focus and I have comparatively mild paranoia like I woke up feeling like I couldn't breath and the first place my mind went to was a familly member was trying to smother me in my sleep. Yk? Like it could be worse but still not great. I keep reading into others words and thinking its negative and that they lowkey hate me/dislike me lol. Not great either. Yk? Like i'm already bad at reading tone and body language so I just tell myself i'm likely misreading them and that works.

Didn't go to a psychiatrist for alot of reasons but genuinely I think I just need therapy not meds.Also was worried about bipolar but thats long depression right? I'm tracking my mood and honestly(along with hormone issues and me not being depressed for long) Idk I dont get my period so this makes it 10 times harder. Atm I just realized this might be pmdd somehow and idk how to bring it up to a doctor who was trivializing everything and i do feel lke an attention seeker. What if my cycle is super drawn out and messed up. (It likely is).

(I go to a psych i'd probs get mood stabilizers atp cause wtf but its not that big of a deal and i don't think i need to do anything serious like that.  Haven't been productive for at least a week maybe two and yet i stopped feeling down and depressed. I'm kinda insecure af but also feeling top of the world singing dancing randomly yk? like adhd type but I also don't have a bunch of huge paranoia I did in the past.))

This feels scrambled, I can't unscramble it. Got back into spirituality, all that jazz, i'll probs eventually fall back down out of it eventually(I need to asap.) lol (:

So I'm not sure how long untill that happens but my mood has been so amazing all week. Sleep has been good, nothing too egregious i've been getting 6 hours which is perfect. Not too little so its not concerning.

Then I get depressed for a couple weeks. Which sucks alot. ): I also quit coffee a month or so ago so maybe i'm just recouperating from that? idk how one can untangle possible pmdd from bipolar cause yk idk when my cycle is.

No coffee no alcohol no substances ect just tea here and there. Not even being productive which sucks but i'm so glad i am not taking college classes right now(need to deal with this once classes are over and what seems to help the most is working out.

Problem is, I drink water and coffee, this was made worse by the fact he never reached out to me to see if I was okay. I had borderline heat stroke. I ran out of water around noon time and the working conditions were over 115 degrees with no AC available. 

So, I made a professional and eloquent post to the chat about how unprofessional I thought his reaction was and that I was putting my phone on silent. 

He said if I'm putting my phone on silent I can see him in the morning. So I responded like a child with Bet, I'll come in after I talk to HR. 

Little did he know I was talking to his boss as this happened. And his boss gave me the VP of HRs cell phone number to call in the morning. 

Needless to say, by the time I called in the morning, both his boss and the VP of HR had already talked to him and after our conversation they revisited the issue when I gave more information about the work environment there. 

Hint my regional manager was also in the military and we've had a few conversations about a lot of different policies and are on the same page about almost everything. So when he saw how pissed I was. He acted. 

I took yesterday off and still haven't heard from my boss. Which isn't odd but I'm assuming he's not used to someone slamming a door on his dick like I did yesterday.

He does the ""betta death hang"" and his fins are shedding white (I read that is likely related to fin rot). He is very round, but he is not pineconing. 

My current plan now that he's been acclimated to his tank is to start on kanaplex. I'm hoping the new tank with a good filter and heater will help. I am thinking about fasting him because he looks overweight.

I can't help but feel like I'm running out of time and missing out on the college experience. I go to classes, work, participate in clubs, see my boyfriend, and hangout with friends maybe once or twice a month. I always see the friends I do have hanging out with other people and having spontaneous hangouts and it's so defeating, I just wish I had what they had. I also live alone and will be in this apartment almost until I graduate. My two closest friends hangout without me sometimes and will be living together in the fall, making me feel even more secluded. 

I understand that what I'm seeing probably isn't the full truth - Im sure my friends and the people around me don't spend as much time with friends as I perceive they do. But still, they're definitely doing more than I am and having a ""real"" college experience. 

I'm introverted and shy, but I'm so insanely desperate for friends. I want people to grab coffee with or study with or go out with or sit on their couch and drink and watch stupid movies with. I'm so scared that I'm going to miss out on all of this. This is the only time I'll be in college and get this chance, and I feel so alone in the entire experience. 

Is there anything else I can do? I feel like I've exhausted all of my options and keep just breaking down about how alone I feel platonically. ",1,1751153759.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1ln0iqm,https://i.redd.it/2k74b6cq6r9f1.jpeg,A Dreamy Mountain Tour in the Caribbean ‚Äì Who‚Äôs in?,"Hey tropical sisters! 

Have you ever thought about trading sandy beaches for misty peaks‚Äîjust for a day? Last weekend, I joined a small group tour up into the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, and honestly... it felt like stepping into a different world. 

Picture this: winding trails shaded by giant ferns, wild orchids peeking out from the rocks, and the scent of freshly roasted coffee drifting from hillside farms. We started early, just as the morning mist curled through the trees, and the sun painted everything in soft gold. 

One of my favorite moments? Reaching a lookout point where the breeze felt like a hug, and the island spread out below in every shade of green and blue imaginable. We stopped for a picnic of fresh fruit‚Äîpineapple, mango, and even starfruit‚Äîright under a flowering tree. 

The vibe felt so feminine: gentle, wild, and quietly powerful. I found myself chatting with other girls about life, love, and dreams while our guide (a lovely woman herself!) shared local folklore about forest spirits and mountain magic. 

If you‚Äôre ever in the Caribbean and want to do something a little different, a mountain tour is pure tropical femininity in nature form: graceful, mysterious, and utterly refreshing. 

Would any of you love to do this? Or have you done something similar? Let‚Äôs talk dreamy hikes and misty mountain magic!

1ln0h0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1ln0h0u/always_the_victim/,Always the victim,"We have a long term on and off guest of a year or so who is on the edge of wearing out her welcome at the hotel. I've complained about her [before](https://redd.it/1gdmi8h), she used to have a habit of talking my ear off, usually about herself and never about anything I had any interest in. Fortunately that has mostly stopped. One day she was hanging out in the lobby on the couch babbling away at me and after a few minutes I stopped bothering contributing to the ""conversation"" with noises of acknowledgement (the only participation I'd ever had in these conversations) and eventually she noticed and got self conscious. That was maybe 20 minutes after I stopped pretending to listen.

She still talks at me when she comes to renew her room or get coffee, but now it's for five minutes instead of thirty. It's still not anything worth listening to. It's a lot of ""I'm so great and the world is so unfair and nothing is ever my fault."" She's a narcissistic liar and manipulator who would probably be a bigger problem if she wasn't also an idiot. We haven't kicked her out yet because while she's extremely annoying, she's harmless and it's been a slow year for us.

We've had a number of transient long term or hoping to be long term guests lately, some of whom we get along with better than others. Times are hard for everyone, so when one of our guests who otherwise isn't a source of headaches for us needs a little wiggle room on when they pay, we try to be flexible and understanding. As things so often do though, it got out of hand. This week we cleared house of a bunch of guests who had become headaches and had to put our foot down for the folks who had gotten a little too comfortable with paying late all the time.

The subject of the post had not been one of those people actually, she'd been paying pretty consistently and had maintained a room for a few months. But then she came to the desk this morning telling me she wouldn't be able to pay until the evening. I apologized and told her I needed payment by noon. She got into her ""oh woe is me's"" and ""I never ask for any favors"" and ""I always pay on time's"" and I.... held my tongue.

I held my tongue because in that moment I specifically remembered her asking to pay late about a month ago. I specifically remembered that time because that time she made the same claim about never paying late or asking for favors. I'd declined that time as well because she was full of shit. She'd made such a habit of paying late that a few months before that she'd already been told we couldn't let her pay late anymore. Guess she was hoping we forgot. Then hoped we forgot again.

I held my tongue because there was no point not to. She'd try to DARVO her way out of it, or lie and pretend she didn't remember having paid late in the past. I've dealt with a lot of professional victims over the years, I knew better than to get bogged down in that fight just for the sake of my own ego.

Instead of calling her on the lie, I just acted apologetic and repeated that she'd need to pay by noon. To try to make it not sound targeted or personal, I explained that late payments had become an issue lately among all our guests so we weren't taking late payments from anyone. She lamented how unfair it was for her to be effected when she hadn't done anything wrong blah blah blah. I couldn't focus on what she was saying because I was at that point wrestling to keep my mouth shut to keep from calling her on her shit. I know me, and I know that whatever came out would probably consist mostly of insults and cuss words which she would also twist into her victimhood.

Yes ma'am, nothing is ever your fault.

I was seeing red at the nerve and disrespect of her thinking I'm dumb enough to buy her lies, and I really wanted to bitch about it with the GM but she's on vacation and I promised myself I wouldn't bother her with anything work related while she's gone, just JD Vance memes. So instead I texted the owner to bitch about it with him. He was also down for a good bitch sesh so he called me and we talked about how much we don't like her, but also agreed that at this point we'd still keep taking her money.

After checkout time, the HHK went around to confirm that rooms were vacant then came to the desk to ask about the guest. She asked, does the guest have no money? I told her no, she had asked to pay late and I told her that she had to pay by 12 but she probably was going to check out. Well, it turns out that she had flagged the HHK down and tried to borrow money from her. Obviously the HHK said absolutely not.

But maybe this will finally be her undoing, even though I expect there's a roughly 100% chance that she's going to deny it and say the HHK misunderstood her. I will see what the GM wants to do when she comes back.",19,1751153465.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3,1.0,False

Played pool once, and he messaged me first not long after, in early March. We started talking more ‚Äî daily, deeply, and emotionally. From late March to April, we didn‚Äôt see each other in person for almost a month, but our emotional connection deepened. He flirted, opened up, and things felt like they were naturally progressing. It felt real.On my birthday in April, his friend told me he was ‚Äúconfused‚Äù about his feelings for me since these random girls took his phone and said that he went on a rant on how he doesnt want me but his friend explained everything as he got chated on in a previous situation ship. That hurt, especially after everything we‚Äôd shared. But I didn‚Äôt confront him. I stayed calm, patient ‚Äî I wanted to be different from the people who had hurt him before. A day later we met upays later, he talked to me directly. He said he‚Äôd been scared, that his past situationships made him hesitant, and discussed them all and said we should take things slow. he told me not to get attached and stuff.howevr we got intimate the day after we hung, as He said the way I didn‚Äôt jump to conclusions ‚Äî how understanding I was ‚Äî made him like me again.After that, things continued. We told each other ‚ÄúI love you"" that day we started getting intimate and the week after so many times. We made casual plans about how we‚Äôd one day tell our families if things got serious, travelling together whatnot the week after that and i went to his house for the first time. It felt like we were building something slowly and mutually. I asked him if he wanted to date that day ‚Äî and he said yes. We officially dated for 2 days.

But in those two days, I felt something was off. He was acting a little distant ‚Äî not cold, but not the same. So I gently reached out. I messaged him asking how his day was, then asked to call. That‚Äôs when he told me he wasn‚Äôt ready. That his fears came flooding back the day after and on the day he told me. he said we had to stop the intimacy and wanted to be solely platonic. He cried before. I cried on the call with him. He said it wasn‚Äôt about me ‚Äî it was about the weight of his past. He told me I could call the next day if I wanted, and I did and said he willl be here for me, but he said i had to move on. He invited me over the next day.

That day he made me food, coffee ‚Äî looked after me like he still cared. We talked. I asked if I could take my shirt off (I was hot),cause i excercised lmao after being on call with his friend and he said it was fine. Later, in his room, he said again he didn‚Äôt want to use me, that he felt guilty, but debated whether to be intimate. i asked him if he wanted me to put my shirt back on but he was fine with me having it off. I told him i was okay with it ‚Äî because emotional connection mattered to me since it was hard to let everything go considering the past weeks. That day, we were intimate again. He told me I couldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù anymore, and when I slipped, he reminded me. he said that if he gets a gf we would have to stop being intimate which did hurt me but i was fine with it anyhow cause yk. I remember zoning out while kissing him, and he asked what was wrong. I couldn‚Äôt say it, but I was scared ‚Äî scared that he was slowly detaching while pretending to still be close. i cried during cuddling and stuff and he said ""dont cry now"" and like ""cry when its over"".

Later, I learned he had asked someone else to a ball around the time we were intimate.she did just wanna go as friends tho. He braided another girl‚Äôs hair in front of me 2 days after i last went to his house and was intimate w him. even though they were jus friends and that girl had a bf.

And I still don‚Äôt think he meant to be cruel. I think he‚Äôs scared. Unhealed. Emotionally blocked. But I gave him love, trust, patience. I never tried to force anything. I showed up, again and again. When I finally slipped ‚Äî one small, fear-driven lie ‚Äî he walked away. That still makes me feel worthless. he sounded like he didnt care for me at all and didnt want me talking to him, said i lost privalege of hugs when i last called him to talk ab the whole situation ab me lying outta fear. he said to call if its an absolute emegency since he has other friends to take care of and i apologized for crying and he said its ok hes a therapist for a lot of ppl. he said to me to not think hes just free sitting around for or smth like that which hurt cause whenever i needed him and felt sad i called cause he was my comfort zone.

I know I‚Äôm not perfect. But I was real. Loving. Soft. Consistent. I didn‚Äôt play games. I just wanted to show him that not everyone hurts you.

Maybe I was the love he wasn‚Äôt ready for. was i in the wrong? i messed up i shouldve never lied.

he said i crossed his boundaries since i lied and none of his friends have lied and stuff and he doesnt trust me so i respected and gave him space and said i wont contact him despite me begging",1,1751153265.0,offmychest,0,0.99,False

1ln03hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1ln03hd/hemorrhoidectomy_report_days_15_positive/,"Hemorrhoidectomy report: Days 1-5, positive!","All the surgery reports people have posted have been helpful, so here's mine! It's currently day 5, so some of the early details are a bit fuzzy.

TL:DR; it's been going great, no screaming poops. Kind of dull, really. 

I'm a woman in my mid-50s, overweight, desk job. I live alone. This was my first ""real"" surgery. I've had hemorrhoids for about 25 years, worsening over time. I blame a lifetime of reading and lingering on the toilet. Pregnancy/childbirth (a particularly fast and therefore forceful labor) and a few years of weightlifting in my 40s didn't help. Over the last few years, they were bleeding enough to make me severely anemic. We tried multiple RBLs for about a year but they did not make a significant difference.

My surgery was on Tuesday. My surgeon's notes show that she excised circumferential Grade 4 hemorrhoids (3 columns) and ligated four internal hemorrhoids. No external sutures. Dissolving internal sutures.

Preparation/diet:  
I made sure to eat extra healthy for a month before the procedure...well, until the last week, when I got into some emotional eating. I also stopped all alcohol for the month, per ERAS guidelines.

Some people do very specific prep in terms of diet, but my surgeon didn't require or recommend anything. I was thinking that anything I ate on Monday could be coming out over the surgical site, so for Sunday and Monday I avoided foods with lots of insoluble fiber like seeds, whole grains, corn, leafy greens, etc etc. Basically anything you might expect to see in your poop! I also avoided spicy/peppery food on those two days. I also tried to hydrate really well.

Preparation/supplies: chux pads, maxi pads, gauze squares, adult diapers, bidet, peri (lab wash) bottles, squatty potty, in-toilet sitz bath, a case of wet wipes, lots of disinfectant wipes for the toilet/bathroom/sitz bath. Also snacks for my bedroom, because I was worried I might not be able to get to the kitchen: Ensure protein shakes, shelf-stable fruit cups, protein bars, applesauce pouches. 

My surgery was scheduled for 7:45, so I was asked to stop all food/drink except clear liquids at 10 pm Monday, drink clear liquids at bedtime and 2 hours before checkin. I thought about getting Ensure Pre-surgery but I only found it as part of an expensive pack, so I just drank Gatorade. Didn't sleep much that night from anxiety as well as a very early wakeup time. 

I Ubered to the hospital, arriving a few minutes before the checkin desk opened at 5:30. ""It's going to be a ghost town,"" I thought, just before I rounded the corner and found the line of 20 people. Fortunately the process was very efficient and I was soon brought back to the changing area. I changed into a hospital gown and put all my belongings (aaa, my phone) into a bag that a staff member took away for safe storage. (The instructions told me to bring my CPAP but the staff all said that they never actually use them, thanks.) After a brief wait I was wheelchaired to the pre-surgical unit and moved to a stretcher. Over about an hour,  I met a great nurse, the surgical resident and the surgeon, and the anesthesia resident and attending, signed consent forms, answered medical history questions, etc. When I went to pee before the IV was inserted, my nurse gave me a ""hat"" to collect the urine for a pregnancy test. I was the first scheduled surgery of the day, so I was wheeled into the OR right on time. 

Surprisingly, the surgery was done in the lithotomy position instead of the jackknife position. The anesthesia was administered by IV. I was not intubated - the natural airway was maintained with a device called an LMA. The surgeon did not use Exparel per se but she did inject a similar cocktail of local anesthetics.

I woke up in the PACU (post-anesthesia care unit). I didn't have nearly as much bandaging as I expected, just a pair of mesh panties and a maxi-type pad. Not even any internal gauze packing. The surgical site was pretty numb. It felt like I came out of the anesthesia pretty smoothly, just waking up normally. A couple of different nurses came in and talked to me about how I was feeling and post-surgical instructions. I got myself dressed with no problems, the staff called the friend who was waiting to drive me home, and a staff member wheeled me out to her car. The 30 minute ride home was fine and I was fully lucid enough to give directions, get set up in my house, etc. 

After my friend came back with my prescription, I drank some water, changed into a diaper, and went to sleep. My instructions were to take oxycodone later in the day, with optional acetaminophen and ibuprofen. I wasn't in a ton of pain, maybe a 2. At first I figured I should ""stay ahead of the pain,"" so I took the first two scheduled oxycodone. After that I decided it was better to save them for later in the week when the local would wear off. I switched to alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

Very little appetite, drank lots of Gatorade and a couple of protein shakes. Made it to the kitchen for freezer pops.

When I got out of bed every few hours, the movement would trigger farting. This was more uncomfortable than painful. I urinated sometime in the afternoon, and passed a small soft poop around 8 pm. Again, it was fine, although figuring out the best way to clean up took some experimentation. I wound up using the sitz bath for a couple of minutes then dabbing very gently with wet wipes. 

  
Day 2 (Weds): Still good. Keeping up with the scheduled acetaminophen/ibuprofen, plus colace and senna per my instructions. Many naps.  Every time I got out of bed, I farted, and that usually triggered the urge to pee. Then when I was sitting on the toilet my inner muscles involuntarily squeezed hard to push out a small poop or blood clot. Again, this was uncomfortable but not particularly painful. There was some stinging. Warm air from a blow dryer helped with that. Can of chicken noodle soup for dinner. 

Day 3 (Thurs): Worried that this was the day the local would wear off and I would suddenly have horrible pain. Nope. Kept taking acetaminophen/ibuprofen. Realized I was only taking a half dose, started taking the full dose just in case. Ate some white rice, more protein shakes, canned fruit, sourdough bread, packaged bone broth, pudding. Lots of water. Walked around the house, practiced guitar (standing) for 20-30 minutes. Pooping similar to Day 2. In the afternoon I put on clothes and took a short walk to a coffee shop for decaf and pastry. Homemade chicken vegetable soup for dinner. 

Day 4 (Fri): The same as Day 3. Maybe a little more discomfort from the local wearing off? I feel some discomfort when I get out of bed, it feels like getting vertical causes more blood to pool in the hemorrhoidal blood vessels? But they accommodate in a couple of minutes. Another trip to the coffee shop, plus the nearby CVS for more freezer pops. More homemade soup for dinner.

Day 5 (Sat) More of the same. This time I met some friends at the coffee shop, where I stood by the table where they were sitting. Did more walking than before, a little grocery shopping, it was fine. After a couple of hours out, I came home and took a nap. My surgeon recommended sticking to soup/noodles/easy to digest food for a couple of weeks, so that's what I'm doing. A lot of people start a lot of fiber early in recovery but my surgeon wants me to wait before adding it. 

So yeah. It's been fine. I was really scared that it was going to be awful and it's not. Not to dismiss people who have a more difficult recovery! Everyone's experience is different. I'm lucky to have few responsibilities, a high tolerance for pain, and a nearby coffee shop.

Hey r/Shopping and r/DealsReddit!

Anyone else feel like finding furniture for a small apartment is a special kind of hell?üòÖ I recently moved into a place where every square inch counts, and the struggle to find pieces that fit my needs without making the place look like a cluttered disaster was REAL. I needed a coffee table, but not just any coffee table. I needed storage, and a place to occasionally work from my couch without destroying my back.

That's when I stumbled upon the modern lift top coffee table. I'd seen them online, but always worried they'd look cheap or be wobbly. After weeks of searching for small apartment furniture ideas, I decided to take a chance on one I found browsing on ursupermart.com.

Honestly? I'm pretty impressed, and I wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone else in a similar situation.

The biggest selling point, and the reason I even considered it, is the lift-top. Seriously, it's a game-changer for small spaces. No more hunching over my laptop on the couch, slowly turning into a question mark. Now, I just lift the top, and boom ‚Äì instant ergonomic workspace! It's also perfect for eating dinner in front of the TV (judge me if you must!). It feels way more civilized than balancing a plate on my lap. Plus, it saves me from having to clear everything off the table every time I want to eat. Time saved = stress reduced, right?

But the lift-top is just the beginning. This thing also has a hidden storage compartment underneath. Seriously, it's like a black hole for clutter. I've stashed blankets, remotes, magazines, even my yoga mat in there. It's amazing how much stuff you can hide away. My living room instantly looks more organized, which honestly makes me feel less stressed. I swear, my anxiety levels have gone down since I got this thing! I'm estimating it's reduced clutter by at least 30%, which is a huge win in my book.

I was a little worried about the transition between coffee table height and dining table height being clunky, but it's actually super smooth. It feels sturdy and well-made, not like it's going to collapse on me mid-meal. It's a seamless transition, which is something I didn't even realize I needed until I experienced it.

I know what you're thinking: ""Okay, but what about the aesthetics?"" I was worried about that too. I didn't want some ugly, utilitarian piece of furniture ruining my carefully curated apartment vibe. But this table actually looks pretty good! I got it in black, and it has a sleek, modern design that fits right in with my other furniture. It doesn't scream ""cheap apartment furniture."" It actually makes the place look more put-together, which definitely boosts my confidence when I have guests over.

For anyone else struggling with small space living, I highly recommend checking out lift top coffee tables with storage. It's like getting a coffee table, dining table, and storage unit all in one stylish package. And honestly, the cost savings are real. I was considering buying a separate dining table and storage ottoman, but this table eliminated the need for both. It's a space saving coffee table for a small apartment.

If you're looking for a modern lift top coffee table that converts to dining table for small spaces, this might be worth checking out. You can find it here if you are curious: https://go.ursupermart.com/guBkbV

I'm not saying it's perfect. It's still just a piece of furniture. But it's made a huge difference in how I use my small living space. I feel more organized, more comfortable, and even a little more stylish. And in a tiny apartment, those things are worth their weight in gold. It solves the problem of limited space and lack of functional furniture perfectly.

1ln02mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/eShoppingUSA/comments/1ln02mx/coffee_table_lift_top_table_for_small_apartments/,Coffee Table: Lift Top Table for Small Apartments,"**Title:** Coffee Table Find! A Modern Lift Top Coffee Table for My Tiny Apartment

Okay, Reddit, I gotta share this find with you all, especially my fellow small apartment dwellers! üè†

So, I‚Äôve been on the hunt for, like, *forever* for a decent coffee table. My living room is basically the size of a shoebox (okay, maybe a big shoebox), and everything I found was either way too big, super ugly, or crazy expensive. I needed something that could actually *do* something, not just sit there and collect dust bunnies.

Then, I stumbled upon this Modern Lift Top Coffee Table. I know, I know, ""lift top coffee table"" sounds kinda...blah. But hear me out! This thing is seriously a lifesaver.

First of all, the lift-top mechanism is amazing. Seriously, saves me so much time. I can quickly turn my living room into a temporary workspace without having to clear off all my remotes, books, and half-empty coffee cups. It's also perfect for eating dinner in front of the TV (don't judge!), because it brings the table right up to a comfortable height. No more hunching over like some kinda weirdo! My back and neck are definitely thanking me. Plus, I feel way more organized and put-together when I can actually use my living room properly.

But the real kicker is the storage compartment. OMG. It's like a black hole for all my clutter. I used to have, like, a million different storage bins scattered around my apartment, but this table has helped me declutter like crazy. Seriously, I think it's reduced my clutter by a ton. Now I can actually find things when I need them, instead of spending 20 minutes digging through piles of junk. I feel so much less stressed now, it‚Äôs unreal! And honestly, feeling organized just makes me feel more stylish, too, which is a total bonus.

I was especially trying to decide whether to buy online from supermarts.com or a local furniture store so I checked to see if there was a store near me. Turns out there was one but it had a limited selection and the workers were all busy, which is a terrible experience for me. I ended up buying online and everything went smoothly.

Honestly, it's like having a coffee table, dining table, and storage unit all rolled into one stylish piece of furniture. And let me tell you, the seamless transition between coffee table and dining table height is something you don't see every day. This feature alone is worth it. The functionality is just top-notch, and I'm genuinely satisfied with how versatile it is.

And speaking of cost, I was seriously worried about breaking the bank. But this table actually saved me money in the long run because I didn't have to buy a separate dining table or additional storage furniture. That's a win-win in my book! It can save the cost of buying separate dining table and storage unit. Eliminates the cost of additional storage furniture. Return on investment is immediate by providing a functional and stylish piece of furniture.

Emotionally, this table has been a game-changer. My living space feels so much more stylish and functional, and I'm way more comfortable and convenient. I actually feel confident inviting people over now, because my apartment doesn't look like a disaster zone. Plus, I don't have to worry about having enough space for guests or activities anymore, which is a huge relief.

Someone asked about the dimensions in another subreddit, and I think it's important to mention this. The height and extended height are ideal, and I think it really gives the illusion of increased floor space. The storage capacity is also legit.

So, if you're struggling with limited space and storage in your small apartment, I highly recommend checking out this Modern Lift Top Coffee Table. It's functional, stylish, affordable, and a total lifesaver. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, it was an investment but I think it can save the cost of buying separate dining table and storage unit.

See body for base recipe plus sugar-free syrups I already own.,"Base recipe: 1 tablespoon Javvy coffee concrete plus 1 vanilla Fairlife protein shake (I use a giant cup so I have room for the entire shake plus ice). It‚Äôs SO good!

Sugar-free syrups I own (all Jordan‚Äôs brand): white chocolate, toasted marshmallow, sugar cookie, salted caramel, raspberry, coconut

So far, I‚Äôve tried white chocolate plus toasted marshmallow and white chocolate plus salted caramel (plus each of the above flavors on its own).

Any other flavor combos I should try? Ideally, I‚Äôd like to work with the syrups I already own. I‚Äôve tried making proffee with a chocolate protein shake as the base, but all I could taste was the shake itself, not the coffee or syrup. Would the obvious solution of using more syrup or coffee fix this, or will their flavors still get lost in the chocolate since it‚Äôs so strong?",1,1751152152.0,Protein,0,1.0,False

1lmzzue,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lmzzue/explore_best_coffee_maker_keurig_kslim_review/,Explore Best Coffee Maker? Keurig K-Slim Review Inside,"I‚Äôve had my morning routine absolutely transformed since adding the Keurig 5000357869 to my countertop. Life before this sleek, single-serve coffee maker was nothing short of chaotic‚Äîa war zone of half-brewed pots, spilled grounds, and the constant guesswork of how much coffee I‚Äôd need to stay semi-human throughout the day. Working from home in a small apartment, space is king, and the 5-inch wide design felt like it was built specifically for my kitchen‚Äôs one and only corner of counter real estate. But behind its tiny footprint hides enough brewing power to handle a full-on caffeine emergency.

**Design and Size That Actually Makes Sense**  
Imagine trying to wedge a traditional drip coffee machine into a narrow nook beside your toaster and blender‚Äînah, not happening. I live in an older studio where cabinet space is tighter than a subway at 8AM. This coffee maker fits perfectly, standing just under 5 inches wide and about a foot tall with an unobtrusive matte-finished casing that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúkitchen gadget.‚Äù I was pleasantly surprised at how uncluttered the countertop felt despite adding a full-blown brewing station. The removable 46 oz water reservoir only sweetened the deal‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to slide out and refill without needing jungle gym-level flexibility to reach under cabinets.

**Brewing Performance in the Real World**  
No joke, I‚Äôve used this every single day for over a month, and it‚Äôs never made me late for a Zoom call. The three brew sizes (8, 10, and 12 oz) actually give me flexibility depending on how zombie-like I feel in the morning. The standout? The Multistream Technology. I didn‚Äôt think something marketed with a fancy-sounding name would matter, but the coffee somehow just tastes more... well, more. I tested some old pods I‚Äôd abandoned weeks ago after disappointing results in a different brewer, and they actually came out fresh, hot, and with that deep aroma you‚Äôd expect from a decent coffee shop.

**Ease of Use That Barely Requires Being Awake**  
Before caffeine, I operate at toddler IQ levels. Thankfully, this thing is basically idiot-proof. Buttons are intuitive: you plug in a pod, press one of the size options, and coffee appears magically within two minutes. The drip tray pops off easily for travel mugs‚ÄîI've fit my obnoxiously tall 20 oz. thermos under there without any spills. The auto-off feature is a blessing in disguise too. I constantly forget to turn off appliances, so knowing this shuts off five minutes after brewing made me feel a little less like a fire hazard. My younger sibling, who just started college and burns toast more often than not, also figured it out without calling me for tech support.

**Strengths**  
What really makes this machine stand out?

- Takes up minimal space without sacrificing brewing power
- Multistream Technology makes K-Cups taste significantly better
- Removable 46 oz reservoir means I don‚Äôt need to refill daily
- Auto-off function helps with energy efficiency
- Compatible with My K-Cup Universal Coffee Filter for using your own grounds

**Flaws**  
Not everything‚Äôs sunshine and espresso shots though.

- Can be loud during brewing‚Äîearly morning stealth? Not happening
- Plastic exterior feels a bit flimsy compared to higher-end models
- Reservoir lid is slightly awkward to open if placed under cabinets
- Only makes one cup at a time‚Äîgroup coffee rounds take patience

**Product Contenders**  
I‚Äôve tried a few other machines over the years‚ÄîNespresso Vertuo, another Keurig Classic model, and even a Hamilton Beach single-serve. The Nespresso was absolutely gorgeous and offered superior crema, but the pods were pricey and limited in coffee types. The Hamilton Beach was huge and more affordable, but the flavor wasn‚Äôt even in the same ballpark. Compared to the Keurig Classic I owned previously, the compact design and enhanced flavor extraction of this newer model really seal the deal. No gimmicks, no learning curve, just better coffee in a better chassis.

**Value Assessment**  
I debated for a solid week before making the jump, scanning every review out there. Single-serve brewers can seem overpriced for what's essentially a glorified button-pusher, but this one really delivers for its range. You don‚Äôt just get speed and ease‚Äîyou get coffee that holds its taste consistently. I‚Äôm not making five cups a day, so the cost per use winds up being totally justifiable over time. Simple filter compatibility also gives some budget flexibility, meaning I don‚Äôt feel locked into one type of pod forever. For folks who crave decent coffee without brewing a whole pot or sacrificing precious space, this machine is hands-down worth it.

I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game sometimes on my switch. I also love dogs, if you have one send pics PLZ. I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too. üòä
