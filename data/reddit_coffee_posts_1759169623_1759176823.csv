1ntsm40,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1ntsm40/explore_best_ice_maker_for_home_use_ecozy/,Explore Best Ice Maker for Home Use ecozy IM-NS280B Review Worth It,"Testing out the ecozy IM-NS280B ice maker has been such an interesting experience. I’ve always wanted something portable to handle nugget ice, and this product grabbed my attention with its promise of soft, chewable ice and smart capabilities. The ecozy IM-NS280B is designed for ease and flexibility, but like any other product, it’s not entirely flawless. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of how it performed in daily use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This stainless steel machine looks sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen counter setup. With dimensions of 8.66""D x 11.3""W x 12.68""H, it’s compact enough not to dominate your counter space, but still sturdy with its 20.3-pound weight. I put it to the test by schlepping it to a small backyard party, and it’s surprisingly portable. Cleanup is minimal thanks to the glossy steel exterior, though you’ll occasionally need to wipe off fingerprints. It comes with an ice scoop and a set of ice bags, which adds convenience for storage or party use—both were touches I didn’t expect to love as much as I did.

**Performance and Ice Quality**  
Every product promises great performance, but this ice maker really walks the talk. Producing 34 pounds of soft, chewable nugget ice daily, it keeps pace with most ice demands, whether for everyday drinks, iced coffee, or—you know—those random moments where you just feel like chomping on ice. My personal favorite thing to do is toss some in my smoothies. The texture is perfect, especially for those who are sticklers about getting soft ice without jaw-breaking chills. It’s reasonably quiet for what it is. Don’t expect complete silence, especially during peak ice production, but compared to some older, clunkier models I’ve tried, this one’s refreshingly low-key.

**Smart Features and Connectivity**  
What makes this ice maker stand out from many competitors on the market is its integration with smart home ecosystems. Using the EcozyHome app, I could control everything from turning it on, scheduling ice production, and receiving alerts when water levels dropped or the ice bin filled up. These app notifications are a lifesaver, especially if you’re running around or getting distracted while hosting. Setting it up was straightforward, though it’s worth noting that the app only supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connections. It’s a limitation I stumbled upon but worked around without too much hassle. Voice control via Alexa or Google Assistant takes this convenience a step further—I felt a little like Tony Stark commanding an ice machine to do my bidding. 

**Ease of Maintenance**  
A machine like this could be a chore to clean, but thankfully, the self-cleaning function minimizes that headache. I gave it a good test, running it multiple times over the weeks to gauge its effectiveness. The process is simple, and the inner compartment remained visibly pristine. This feature is a huge win for a lazy cleaner like me who doesn’t want to deal with scrubbing hidden crevices. That said, the drip tray could have been slightly better designed; water sometimes splashes when emptying it, but it’s a minor gripe.

**Benefits**  
- Compact and portable, perfect for small spaces or events  
- Produces chewable nugget ice loved by all ages  
- Smart controls via app and voice assistants  
- Self-cleaning minimizes maintenance efforts  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Requires 2.4GHz Wi-Fi for app functionality  
- Occasional water splashes while draining the drip tray  

**Competing Products**  
To better see how this ice maker holds up, I compared it to a well-known rival, the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker. While the GE option also produces great nugget ice, its chunkier build makes it less portable and more of a permanent kitchen installation. On the other hand, the ecozy IM-NS280B has the upper hand when it comes to app-based controls and affordability. It’s also easier to store in tighter spaces, which gives it additional points for those living in cozier apartments. 

**Value for Money**  
Let’s be honest, purchasing a smart ice maker might not be the most budget-sensitive choice, but it’s about balancing convenience with functionality. The ecozy IM-NS280B leans favorably in this department. It’s neither the most expensive nor the cheapest, but for what it offers—smart controls, chewable ice, a compact build—it’s well worth considering if you’re aiming to invest in something reliable. There’s a good price-to-quality ratio here that gives it an edge over many alternatives.

1ntsbg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1ntsbg9/my_partner_is_close_with_his_ex_in_a_way_that/,My partner is close with his ex in a way that just feels off. Am I just being insecure?,"I've been with my partner for just over a year, and he is WONDERFUL. Very gentle and kind, a friend as well as a lover, and we rarely get into disagreements. For context, he has not really had a long term relationship before me and he only has one significant ex, Bridget. Their relationship fizzled after one of them moved but now she lives in the same city as us, and they are good friends, which I have always taken as a green flag. They hang out together or in groups regularly, and she's been invited to every party or gathering he's thrown since we've been together. Me and her have always gotten along well and I've even texted her separately and we've hung out briefly to get coffee one on one. 

Here is where things felt off: there's a convention coming into our city in a few months with events that require pre-ordered tickets, and me and my partner picked out some to go to together, which I had assumed we were doing as a couple. In fact, one of the picks we ended up going with I chose because I knew he would prefer it over what I wanted to go to, and I wanted him to have the experience of the event he was more excited about (the tickets are pricey so I could only really afford going to two or three). However, when he let me know the tickets had been gotten, he let me know that his ex Bridget would also be coming to that event. I made a joke about him feeling comfortable inviting his ex, which he let me know he was uncomfortable with (very fair, and I apologized), but for whatever reason, it has led me down a strange mental path surrounding Bridget and I can't tell if any of what's making me feel weird is rational. 

The ticket buying and also a recent conversation they had at a different event (where they talked about a show they'd been texting about) has highlighted for me that they do talk a lot more than I necessarily realized. They do hang out one on one or with a friend or two fairly regularly, and this is not the first time he has invited her to something without mentioning it to me, it's just that I haven't given it any thought before. They are also from the same state (I am from a totally separate area of the country but we all moved to the same city) and there has been a sticking point in my and his relationship before around him potentially wanting to move back to his home state at some point. I would not want to move there with him for many reasons ( I don't want to be in an unfamiliar state without a support network of any of my friends/family, he wants to be there largely because he wants to help raise his nieces and nephews, and I really don't want kids or to be responsible for helping raise any, the weather in that state is really harsh for what I'm used to, etc). But Bridget is open to it since she obviously grew up there too. It's hard to ignore too that we are very similar types, both of us being short women with similar builds and tattoos who have a  similar senses of humor/personality. There is a worm in the back of my brain that's whispering that I am just wasting time for him until he moves back home and potentially gets back with her (yes I know this sounds very VERY insecure). To be clear, I am not at all concerned about him cheating. He is a really morally upright and loving guy and I trust him, the idea of him cheating feels almost laughable. I just can't shake a weird feeling around how close they are, and their relationship was recent enough and ended mostly because of the situation and not because they were fundamentally incompatible. I don't want to bring it up to him because I feel like I'm being irrational and spiraling because I feel insecure, and I don't want him to have any weirdness around his friends, but sometimes it does bother me that this figure of romantic and sexual history is so prevalent in our life as a couple, and that he feels so comfortable bringing her into stuff without checking with me at all.

1nts79x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1nts79x/sped_teacher_quit_due_to_being_bit_badly/,SPED Teacher Quit Due To Being Bit….. Badly,"So our lower elementary school special education teacher (we’ll call her Sarah) quit today. While working with a 2nd grade group, she was working with a boy that we will call Charlie (Charlie bit my finger). Well, Sarah got up to move over to another table to work a different student.

Charlie then got out of his seat, walked over to the teacher’s desk, and began to drink her Starbuck coffee. Sarah ran over there to stop him. She then, without touching him, pulled the cup from his hand. She then set the cup down and was going to turn back and talk to him when he attacked.

He grabbed her forearm with both hands and bit down hard. He broke the skin with this bite. The teacher’s aide had to run over and it took both adults to pry him off of her arm. I saw a picture of the bite. She may need stitches.

Well, admin was immediately called in to take over the class so Sarah could get medical help. She went to the nurse where the principal was also waiting for her. Sarah told him that she didn’t want Charlie to ever be in her class again. The principal said that he couldn’t guarantee that since Charlie has “special needs”.

Sarah then told the principal that she wasn’t getting paid enough to get bit. Then she told him that she quit. She then left to go to urgent care to get the bite treated.

So, Charlie’s parents came to the school. Dad let it slip during the meeting with the principal that Charlie was booted from his last school because he bit kids several times. Apparently dad and mom were arguing over if Charlie was at fault or the teacher. Charlie was sent home for the rest of the day. His parents are to come in tomorrow after the disciplinary committee meets today. I’m on the committee.

Personally, I am going to recommend that he gets alternative placement or is expelled. Charlie has already hit several students this year and it isn’t even October.  Plus, I am hoping that if he is gone, then Sarah will decide not to quit and come back. She is a good teacher.",24,1759175742.0,Teachers,5,0.96,False

1nts63h,https://www.reddit.com/r/angelsbaseball/comments/1nts63h/perry_minasian_a_retrospective_look_2025_season/,Perry Minasian: A Retrospective Look (2025 Season Update),"As a continuation of [this post looking at Perry through the years](https://old.reddit.com/r/angelsbaseball/comments/1kgbojd/perry_minasian_a_retrospective_look_into_his/) and my subsequent posts on this thread, here is my 2025 retrospective look:

**2025 Season Update:**

**Trades (a lack thereof):**

Perry, as we entered the 2025 trade deadline 5 games back of .500/a WC3 slot, had a pretty big decision to make: What do we do with our plethora of players on expiring/1 year left deals (highlighted by Ward, Jansen, TA, Hendricks, Moncada, and Rengifo).  While these may not be premium assets at the deadline, years past have shown teams are willing to trade prospects for assets like these, even if it’s low level (with us last year doing some good squeezes for Garcia and Estevez).

As we saw though, Perry came out in front of the fanbase and said “We are **obviously** very competitive” and held on to all of these assets to try and make ground on the WC3 slot.  To contextualize his **obviously** comment: We had horrible run differential, our record was propped up by an unsustainable 1 run game record, and again – we were 5 games back from .500 and the WC3 slot as the teams in front of us all bought at the deadline.

But if we were so **obviously** competitive than, at minimal, we should’ve had a competitive record to close out the season, right?!

19-34, an abysmal .358 record.

Instead of acquiring ANY asset that can refresh our much farm (update on that later), Perry “cooked” and we are in our 2nd 90 loss season in a row – a feat last done in franchise history in 1968 and 1969 (during our first 10 years).

**Our farm (a lack therof):
**
As stated above, our farm was in a desperate need of refresh.

As we entered the 2025 season we had a 30th ranked farm system uplifted by 2 top 100 prospects in Christian Moore (67 overall) and Caden Dana (77 Overall).  There is a smidge of credit because Perry did go out and grab 14 international players to fill up the farm system – but because they are so young and raw this is seen by most as extremely high risk but slimly possible high reward style building (as opposed to other teams who may use their international funds primarily on higher end prospects)/

Our farm system as we entered the season pre draft relied on a couple different details to hash out before we see where we fell:

Christian Moore – Will Perry learn his lesson and not call up his top pick ASAP to allow them to develop and not burn their playing time limit and lose prospect status? (more on this later)

Ryan Johnson – Will Perrys master plan of having RJ not play in the minors at all work out?

Caden Dana – Can he make the next step to solidify himself as a higher end arm on the prospect list?

Aldegheri/Klassen – Can they take the next steps like Dana to solidify themselves as top arm prospects?

I will address Christian Moore later, but for our pitching prospects, they have seemed stuck in this AAAA type player funk.   Dana ended his season starting 5 games (playing in 7) with a -0.4 WAR, 6.40 ERA, and a 6.48 FIP.  Aldegheri started 2 games and appeared in 4 with a -0.5 WAR, 7.90 ERA and a 7.31 FIP.  Klassen remained in the minors.  Ryan Johnson had a lot of eyes on him due to Perry skipping the young arm from the minors to be on the opening day roster, he ended up playing in 14 games with a -0.7 WAR, 7.36 ERA, and a 5.52 FIP (earning him a trip all the way down to Single A).

*And as a quick check in of the Perry Mastered All Pitchers 2021 Draft:
*
Sam Bachman appeared in 23 games of relief pitching only – 20.1 innings. -0.2 WAR, 6.20 ERA, 3.63 FIP

Chase Silseth appeared in 10 games, pitched relief only of 11.0 innings, 0.4 WAR, 1.64 ERA, and 3.86 FIP

Crazy that the 2021 draft, 4 years later, provided our team with only 32 innings of pitching and 0.2 WAR of performance…

***The 2025 MLB Draft
***
As we approached the draft we had a lot of hope at the #2 pick.  We had great draft positioning, we had some higher end college pitching talent, some high end High School prep talent, and all of our picks ready to refill our depleted farm.

As the draft night started, the Nats shockingly took Eli Willits at #1, completely throwing the draft in disarray pretty quickly.  The angels at #2 had some amazing choices to make: Do we go with Ethan Holliday the highly touted HS legacy talent to shore up our 3B hole?  Do we go with Kade Anderson, the electric arm out of LSU a lot of scouts thought was the perfect Angels pick for Perrys quick call ups?  Do we go with a Seth Hernandez and spend some actual developmental time building a pitcher?  Do we go after a guy like Liam Doyle or Jamie Arnold as well known college dawgs?

Manfred came up and announced what we are doing with the #2 pick of the MLB draft:  Tyler Bremner.  An absolute shock to all draft experts.  While Bremner was highly touted pre college season, his stock dropped below some of the other pitchers due to his performance to start his season (even though he ended it well against lesser schools).  There is of course the story behind Bremner and the absolute family tragedy that took place through the school year of his mother passing from cancer.  And while his stock may have dropped because of his performance, he still was on a solid level to work with.  But most people were confused of the idea to underslot the #2 pick (especially with Kade Anderson both going to your in division rival, known to produce elite pitching, who himself signed underslot).

As the rest of the draft played out, Perry used the savings from underslotting that allowed him to acquire 8 new members of our internal top 30 prospects list.  But as the dust settled the new farm rankings came out with:

Angels overall 27th ranked farm

2 top 100 prospects: Christian Moore at 50 and Bremner at 96 (with Ryan Johnson just missing the cut)

Again before we approach Christian Moore, while we picked Bremner at #2, he shook out as the 18th ranked prospect of the draft, falling behind Ethan Holliday, Kade Anderson, Seth Hernandez, Jamie Arnold, and Liam Doyle as players available and needed at the top spot.

Of course time will tell for the young Bremner, and he may still have a successful MLB career ahead of him.  But he will always be tied to this draft class as a “was it worth it at #2, was he better than everyone else”.  It is a high risk gamble Perry took on the kid, and us Angel fans hope Perry is seeing something the experts aren’t.

***Christian Moore:
***
Time to get to Christian Moore, our top prospect since drafting him in last years class.  From day one the question wasn’t “how long will his development take” but “when will Perry call him up in 2025? Will he burn his eligibility and prospect status in year one?”

Let’s start with his holistic performance on the year.  He started off in the Minors with some injuries, but shot through the system (as expected):

In single A: a 1.534 OPS in 4 games

In AA:  .665 OPS in 34 games

In AAA: .853 OPS in 30 games (some time between MLB and AAA happened this season too)

Very quickly Moore was shot up through the system and on 6/13 he made his MLB debut.  In 53 games his line was: .198/.284/.655 with 7 HRs, a 34% K rate, and an overall WAR of 0.1 (0.4 oWAR and -0.3 dWAR).  Putting his full year ~600 AB projected stats at 0.3 WAR.  Not the best showing but a great cup of coffee for our prospect.

But…Christan Moore isn’t a prospect anymore…

***Perry’s Asleep at the Wheel
***
For a prospect to hold onto prospect status/not start their service time contract (basically as a team, you get 5 years of letting a prospect develop.  If within those 5 years they spend 45 days on a MLB roster in the season, then their contract gets converted to a 5 year MLB contract until they hit FA.  The gist is it gives incentive for the Org to develop a prospect and call them up when they are ready instead of rushing guys up quickly).

So why do I bring this up?  On 9/1 Perry decided, after sparse playing time for Moore, to send him down to AAA to get ever day playing time (because we really needed to give ABs to guys like Moncada and Rengifo who we kept on because we were **obviously** competitive).  That sounded like a great idea, the rookie prospect isn’t getting every day ABs so send him down, let him finish the season in AAA and try again next year!

But wait…on 8/31, the day prior, Christian Moore completed his 45th day on an MLB roster, converting his draft contract into a service time contract, thus not only losing his status as a prospect but starting his MLB contract.  So Perry fell asleep at the wheel of our Org and burned the developmental time we could’ve had with Moore.  Just an absolute HILARIOUSLY BAD management that is the epitome of Perry’s Tenure here and his overall approach to our farm.

**Free Agency Work (a step in the right direction)
**
Perry, through his FA work pre season and waiver wire work mid season, acquired 2.5 WAR in total at a cost of $46.8M (I am going to round this down to $40M due to guys being cut).  So in total perry spent $16M per 1 WAR, still way below the average of $8M but much better than his $30ishM he usually spends.  

If we strictly restrict it to offseason signings (off the top of my head its: D’arnaud, Newman, Tim Anderson, Kingery, Kikuchi, Hendricks, and Jansen), he put in a respectable 5.7 WAR of production on $44.8M of contracts, or less that $8M per WAR!  HE’S AVERAGE!!!!!!

Overall that puts his overall FA spend at $272M (will round down to $250M for any contract mistakes) and a TOTAL of 7.8 WAR over the last 5 years, or about $35M per WAR of FAs and Waiver wire pick ups.

Again, some downright terrible spending but he was able to be effective in the offseason, which is a step in the right direction.

Johnny Washington (Suspect of Victim?)

Public enemy #1 this offseason from the fanbase was Johnny Washington, and at an outsiders glace it seems that all batting issues are on him!

But lets quickly go through the history of our batting pre and post Perry, starting in 2018:

Stats laid out as AVG, OBP, OBP Rank, Slug, Slug Rank, OPS, OPS Rank, K%, K% Rank (higher rank is better for k% rankings)

2018: .242 / .313 / 20th / .413 / 12th / .726 / 16th / 21.3% / 8th

2019: .247 / .304 / 14th / .422 / 20th / .746 / 18th / 20.4% / 3rd

2020: .248 / .332 / 9th / .430 / 12th / .763 / 12th / 21.2% / 5th 

**2021: .245 / .310 / 21st / .407 / 17th / .717 / 19th / 23.2% / 16th 
**
2022: .233 / .297 / 26th / .390 / 17th / .687 / 23rd / 25.7% / 30th 

2023: .245 / .317 / 18th / .426 / 8th / .743 / 12th / 24.8% / 26th 

2024: .229 / .301 / 27th / .369 / 28th / .671 / 28th / 23.7% / 19th 

2025: .225 / .298 / 28th / .397 / 17th / .695 / 23rd / 27.1% / 30th 

As we can see when Perry started the 2021 season, our K%s shot straight up.  As a team, pre Perry we hovered around a 21% K rate and usually was a top 10 team.  The moment we took over we are averaging a 25% K rate.

Now, Johnny Washington’s approach is bad for a team like ours (and honestly bad holistically, he likes to trade OBP and patience for HRs), but his philosophy closely aligns with Perry’s which is high K rates are not an issue. And how do we know this?

When Nevin was our manager 2 years ago, he was asked about that high percentage (25% on the season).  His answer was: The org sees that as a productive at bat and that the theories state that high strike outs are good.  Nevin, the hot headed buffoon of a manager, is talking batting theories?  Or more likely, parroting what the front office is telling him.

So yes…fire JWash, just know that this is an organizational philosophy issue at it’s core from Perry, and not a specific batting coach (unless the 3 batting coaches under Perry’s watch somehow all brought higher strike out rates and not either Perry’s approach or roster building).

**The Young Core Performance
**
Of course one of the main components of someone who defends all the above bad farm rankings and overall team rankings would be: THE YOUNG CORE IS ELITE AND SETS US UP FOR YEARS OF SUCCESS THANKS TO PERRY.

But the fact of the matter is, overall, our young core at the MLB level and our farm rankings do not show the excitement that the fan base is trying to have over these guys.

Let me start with: Neto is a stud.  Dude just needs to not be injured for parts of the year but overall Perry did good on this draft pick.  There is nothing in his game that screams streaky or unsustainable, and the fact that he came from a shoulder surgery and still crushed it speaks volumes because he is only growing from this point.

Now lets overall look at some rankings.  If we go on fangraphs, and isolate down to the 2025 season on players age 14-26 (cutting off at  Adell because I don’t believe Rengifo is part of the “young core”).  Our batters that would contribute to this “young core” rank:

25th at 4.4 total fWAR on the season (Neto compromises 3.2 of that fWAR).  As a comparison, Nick Kurtz alone is 4.6 fWAR

Pitching is:

24th ranked at 1.8 fWAR (pretty much held by Soriano at 3.0 fWAR and Detmers at 1.2 fWAR – 2 non Perry pitchers)

Overall, our Young Core still has ample time to develop of course, but there are red flags.  
O’Hoppe continuing his regression from the all star break last year is horrible to see and something you don’t expect from a guy who was drafted in 2018, had years to develop, and started off great.  He is entering his prime seasons and really needs to turn it around.

Schanuel still shows an elite eye and approach at the plate, but his serious lack of power is unbefitting of the position he plays in.  Not that the guy needs to launch 40-50 HRs but he needs to hit it in the power alleys and start hitting some doubles at the least.  Like Nolan is some power away from being a Freddie Freeman like player (seriouslty look at 2024 Freddie Freeman’s savant vs current Schanuel, the difference between them is straight hitting the ball at better angles in the gap)  who also is in the mid 20 HRs.  Saying Nolan needs power isn’t saying he needs to be Bryce Harper.

Christian Moore was outlined above – Perry fell asleep at the wheel and now he NEEDs to start producing at the MLB level instantly.  Time will also tell

Adell has proven to be a valuable at bat but terrible in CF.  The issue is, again, Perry’s horrible roster management.  With us keeping Ward, Trading for Soler, there already is a logjam in the corner OFs.  And with both Nolan and Logan maybe needing a position change to better suit them, that just adds more questions to the mix.

Add to all of this:  a 27th ranked farm that has no answers for our lack of offensive depth, this young core needs to grow exponentially or else everything crumbles.

**Side Notes
**
The Soler trade adds too much salary for a below average aging batter, especially one that sucks in the corner OF that we are log jammed in and takes DH spots away from Trout.

While Canning messed up his ACL on a freak injury, losing him was a big loss to a rotation that was begging for a starter.

Speaking of giving up pitchers,  Patrick Sandoval will be in the mix for Boston next season.  It will be interesting to see how he develops post injury and if the Angels gave up on him too soon.

Overall exiting my criticism of Perry and thinking holistically, we are in a HUGE bind as a franchise.  Our MLB roster is lackluster and losing a lot of players the next 2 seasons WHILE ALSO needing to up pay for the Young Core.  Our GM is on a short extension so whatever plan he has needs to be executed immediately and be successful or we are in a deep hole as his contract expires.  Our manager probably should retire for his own health, which means YET ANOTHER voice leading these young guys.  Like seriously Neto is just hitting arb years and might be working under his 4th manager LOL

I’m sure I’ll add more to this as I mull over the season.  I think 3000 words is a good start lol

I wake up, 6:35 AM, just like every other day. I shower, put my clothes on and head downstairs. No dishes to clean today, I notice as I start my coffee. What a wonderful way to begin the day. As I work hard on my device, I sip my coffee. Nothing out of the ordinary today, just like every other day. After dinner I head to bed with a book in hand. Sometimes it feels like someone is in my closet. I really need to stop leaving the light on in there. My book tonight is quite riveting, I think to myself as I drift off to sleep.

 
___
 

Another day. Always love to start with a shower and getting ready. Feels good to get that out of the way before starting even the most menial of tasks. Dishes in the sink again, I might have to say something. I start my coffee and get working, lots done today! Dinner was fantastic tonight (note – write down recipe). I love falling asleep just listening to the sound of my fan lightly spinning in the night, occasionally broken up by the sound of coughing.

 
___
 

Every day is the same. I slap my 7 AM alarm off as I hop out of bed. I should probably unload the dishwasher this morning, but I’ll save it for later. Coffee starts dripping as I open my device and get to work. Routines are the key to happiness; I was once told. Dinner leaves me wanting more, but I know my limits and would not want to be rude. I fall asleep wondering if my dreams will be as fantastical as the novel I am reading.

 
___
 

10:32 AM. Alarm didn’t go off today. It happens. Coffee was already made when I got downstairs. Did I leave the pot out yesterday? Not important, I am already 2 hours behind schedule. No dishes to worry about today, so I quickly shower and get ready to work. Dinner is alright, but I’m distracted by the light on in the closet. I might need to buy a timer to automatically shut that off. Coughing tonight was out of control, it’s starting to truly bother me. 

 
___
 

6:35 AM, nothing quite like it. The best part of living alone is that I don’t have to worry about my appearances throughout the day. I make my coffee as usual, start work, and let the hours fly by. There was nothing of note to report about dinner today. I can’t believe the twists this book has taken, changing from a fantasy to a sci-fi unexpectedly. The fan lulls me to sleep.

 
___
 

Bright and early. Coffee in the pot, showered, ready, and starting work. I’ll have to clean those dishes soon, but I’d rather not. I slipped up at dinner tonight, prepared two plates instead of one. Sometimes I feel like I am losing it. I lay in bed with my eyes closed, letting the buzz of the fan drown out the coughs. 

 
___
 

Not sure I love the mornings. 7:30 feels way too early to be starting my day, maybe I should push it back tomorrow? I shower, get ready, and open my device. Time to work. Closet light was on again, electricity bill will have to be higher this month, I just know it. After dinner I grabbed my book and drifted off to bed.

 
___
 

6:35 AM. Shower, make my bed, and start cooking breakfast. Same as every other day. As I’m working on my device a strange thought comes to my head. What is it that I do? What a silly question, not sure why these sorts of things come to mind sometimes. Dinner could have been better, but I am not one to critique another’s cooking. My bible provided a perfect segue into sleep as I read through Genesis.

7 AM. I love my routine. Coffee drip begins and I head over to my shower to get ready. I cannot believe there are more dishes in the sink, but I guess that’s the cost of eating at home cooked meals.

We’ve been friends since college, and we usually do a nice dinner for birthdays. Lisa picked a pretty upscale Italian place. I’ve been trying to save money lately, so I was a little stressed, but I didn't want to be a downer. When we sat down, everyone was in a great mood, ordering wine and talking about getting appetizers to share.

I decided to be careful. I ordered a salad as a starter, a main course of pasta that was one of the cheaper options on the menu, and just stuck with water. No alcohol, no dessert. My total, with tax and before tip, came to about $38. Everyone else went all out. They shared multiple expensive appetizers, had steak and seafood mains, ordered two bottles of wine, and finished with dessert and coffee. I enjoyed the conversation and didn't feel deprived, but I was very aware of my budget. When the bill came, it was huge, over $400. Mark, one of the guys, immediately said, ""Okay, let's just split it five ways to make it easy. Happy birthday, Lisa!""

Everyone started pulling out their cards, and I just froze. My share would have been over $80, basically double what I actually consumed. I felt my face get hot. I quietly said, ""Uh, actually, would it be okay if I just paid for what I ordered? My part was a lot less."".  The table went quiet for a second. Mark looked a little annoyed and said, ""Come on, it's for Lisa's birthday. Don't be cheap.""

Lisa herself looked a little uncomfortable and said, ""No, it's fine, whatever is easiest."". But it wasn't fine. I felt put on the spot. I stammered out, ""I'm really trying to stick to a budget. I only had the salad and the linguine, and water. I'm happy to throw in extra for the tip, but I can't pay for the wine and everything else."".  In the end, they agreed, but the mood was awkward for the rest of the night. I Venmoed my exact share plus a 25% tip to Mark, but I could tell he was annoyed. I got a text later from another friend saying I ""killed the vibe"" and should have just gone with the group.

I feel terrible for making Lisa's birthday awkward. A part of me thinks I should have just sucked it up and paid the $80 to keep the peace. But another part of me is frustrated that I'm being made out to be the bad guy for not wanting to subsidize a fancy meal I didn't participate in.

This will be my first time in Colombia!  I’ve traveled quite a bit before, but only around Europe and Asia, so I’m really excited to explore South America.

I’ll be in Colombia from November 1st to 16th and here’s my initial plan:

Days 1–2: Arrive in Medellín + attend a 2day festival (Rivatels).

Day 3: Chill and explore Medellín.

Day 4: Day trip to Guatapé, then take the night bus (10 pm) to Salento.

Day 5: Coffee tour (open to your recommendations ).

Day 6: Cocora Valley hike.

Day 7: Visit Filandia (half day), then fly from Armenia/Pereira to Cartagena.

Day 8: Rosario Islands for snorkeling (any company recommendations?).

Day 9: Travel to Santa Marta ( Caribbean Region) 

Days 10–13: Minca → Tayrona → Los Naranjos. ( I don't have any plan here, so I am open to any suggestions) 

Days 14–15: Bogotá, then fly home.

  
My questions:

\- Is Guatapé a must-visit, or could I skip it?

\- Should I skip Cartagena & Rosario Islands to spend more time in the coffee region or Santa Marta area?

\- Any recommendations for the Santa Marta region (hidden gems, must-dos)?

\- Any other general tips for a first-timer in Colombia would be super appreciated.

  
I like to spend time in nature, surfing, dancing/clubbing and hanging out with people.

At first I thought it was because I was tired and strung-out from moving out of my nmother’s house (which I was) and the idea of buying groceries, figuring out what to buy and then cooking… it felt like one thing too many

I’d been living with my nmother for 4 years and for the last 2 years or so, I couldn’t really access the kitchen

I just lived on meal deals, whatever I’d get from the bakery that day and coffee. I’ve really missed cooking, so I thought that’s one of the first things I’d do after moving out

But now having an entire kitchen of my own has felt a bit overwhelming

Looking at a fridge full of food, trying to mentally remember the sell-by dates and decide what to do with it all has been overwhelming 

So I’ve been doing the Lorelai Gilmore method of ordering food (current favourite is Ask Italian) and living on the leftovers for the rest of the week. It’s a surprisingly okay system

I keep thinking that I’ll just sort of get the hang of buying groceries, cooking and eating

But a bunch of lifestyle content has come up on my social media lately and I find myself literally grimacing at shots of people grocery shopping

Whenever I see videos or shots of fresh food being added to trolleys, I feel nauseous

Has anyone else had this? It feels so weirdly specific I’m expecting everyone to just say ‘no’, but maybe it’s not just me?

Last week I was told I was on the borderline between gingivitis and Periodontal Disease and dentist recommended I use Closys as well as floss and correct brushing. She is currently out of office for half of the week so figured I would ask general questions here until she gets back. 

1. Closys before or after brushing teeth? I use Sensodyne Sensitivity & Gum toothpaste if that makes a difference. 

2. Once or twice a day and for how long or indefinitely? Right now I’m brushing in morning, I have my morning coffee at work then do the Closys after that. Then after dinner I floss, brush and 30 minutes after brushing I use Closys again. 

3. Separately from my dental issues, I’ve switched to eating once a day (dinner). I chew gum from 1 pm to 9pm. Is 8 hours of chewing gum bad for my teeth? Any pros at all? I do it for appetite suppression and it works for me.

1ntrg19,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ntrg19/my_aunt_helped_raise_me_is_beyond_help/,My aunt (helped raise me) is beyond help,"My god. So, yesterday I made a lighthearted joke about ""war-torn Portland"" and how the polyamorous vegan gardeners and avant-garde artists who walk with their plants on a leash just have us Oregonians quaking in our boots (very much sarcasm). I joked about the lines at Powell's being the wildest thing about the city. And so my aunt got SO UPSET and was like ""PORTLAND IS NOT WEIRD! Only Republicans say that. You're acting like Maga, and you need to shut the fuck up about things you know nothing about. I have FRIENDS in Portland!"" and I was like ""yes, so do I. I visited them last week. It was great."" And she just goes on and on about how I just don't know what I'm talking about and I'm stupid and Portland isn't weird; it's wonderful and I'm just feeding into stereotypes. Ummm, like girl, please show me where I said a singular bad thing about Portland??? I've *been* part of the poly LGBTQ vegan demographic. I've gone out of my way to enjoy silly art I find on the sidewalk at 2pm. I love Portland bc it reminds me of Berkeley and Oakland and Seattle. It's weird and that's *delightful*. 

  
She kept absolutely insisting I was wrong and I was a) lying about some art I'd seen, b) was lying about having friends in Portland, c) needed to stop attacking Portland (I wasn't???), and d) needed to stop contradicting her because she knew what she was talking about. I opened my mouth again to be like ""hey, chill out"" and she SCREAMED at me (and I do mean *trembling, dropping coffee out of her mug, top-of-her-lungs SCREAMED* at me*)* ""ENOUGH! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU RUNNING YOUR MOUTH ANYMORE OR ARGUING ON STUFF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! LET ME DRINK MY FUCKING COFFEE IN SOME GODDAMNED PEACE!"" I tried to say I wasn't arguing, and she accused me of being ungrateful (because I'd been staying with her) and to shut the fuck up.

  
At that point, I said ""nope. I'm an adult. You absolutely do not get to speak to me that way. If I'm ungrateful for simply trying to speak to you, I will go ahead and leave now."" I gathered my belongings and packed my car. She said ""you're just too sensitive, I'm sorry you are being dense and can't figure out that I'm right, but yeah. Go call your mommy like the baby you are and if you walk out that door, don't come back. Obviously we just can't ever do anything right and you hate us and we'll never see you again for the rest of our lives, right? You overreact and it's so stupid."". Over *that*. 

  
I'm 30 years old. I draw the line at people screaming at me, regardless of who they are. I'm an adult who is worthy of respect. This is a 74-year-old woman with absolutely no emotional regulation skills whatsoever. You either agree with her 100% of the time over everything, or you get insulted and screamed at. With my dad (dead now, but her brother), it was even worse. Agree, bow to his will, or he'd scream like that and *then* he'd throw you against a wall and beat the shit out of you. Not a single soul on my paternal side ever bothered with therapy or learned how to regulate even a little. They just go from 0 to FULL RAGE in a heartbeat. It is *terrifying* to be in the room with, to see the shift from casual conversation to \*shaking with rage like a rabid dog\* because I didn't buy into their main character syndrome for two seconds. LORD. 

  
That was incredibly triggering for me, and I felt about 3 years old, ready to be hit again. God, that side of the family loved to solve everything with ""ass-whoopings"". Like, fam, just learn to communicate. It has taken me a great deal of therapy to learn these skills, but I'm not hemorrhaging relationships anymore. 



That seemed like a very strong reaction from her. I'm not sure what it means for the future. I don't think I want to go to Thanksgiving with someone who throws tantrums when I don't agree with them. That did not seem healthy, and I don't believe in walking on eggshells or making myself responsible for other people's regulation by avoiding anything that might piss them off. That doesn't seem like it's my responsibility. I do feel really shitty, though. I don't understand why someone would react in a way that would hurt me like that (calling me a baby, screaming at me) who thinks we can just carry on like nothing happened. 

  
This is also on top of the fact that that side of my family blames me for my dad's death. I was no contact for 15 years, and they believed that if I broke NC, it would be enough to convince him to take the cancer treatment. I didn't break NC, he didn't take the treatment, and he died. In their minds, this is my fault, and they have never forgiven me for it. They have acted entitled to their grief, because he was their brother, but I had to find out he died via a Docusign email last week asking me to sign off on his cremation as next-of-kin. I wasn't invited to the funeral, and I have grieved alone. Yes, I was no-contact - because the man, like her, silenced me with displays of dominance and aggression like screaming (and hitting me, in his case). Because the man didn't accept me for who I was. Because I sought unconditional love and he could not provide that. They blame me for his death and their grief, while completely ignoring mine. The man was still my father. 

  
I spent a couple hours talking with my bf yesterday after all this, and god, I am so grateful for him. He really is my peace. But I fear this might be the thing that finally breaks down that relationship. I don't know what to do, if anything.",1,1759173997.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1ntrfyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/genewolfe/comments/1ntrfyi/life_with_the_cave_canem/,Life with the Cave Canem,"It is supposed to be a significant lament in Fifth Head of Cerberus that Ste. Croix is not progressing, that it's degenerated, the location now of squalors:

>“This library was a wastefully large building which had held government offices in the French-speaking days. The park in which it had once stood had died of petty corruption, and the library now rose from a clutter of shops and tenements. A narrow thoroughfare led to the main doors, and once we were inside, the squalor of the neighbourhood vanished, replaced by a kind of peeling grandeur.”

The father of David and Number Five is obsessed with creating a son who can figure out why, why the society is stalled. But for those who've read New Sun, we shouldn't automatically accept that a stalled society necessarily is something to shed tears over, since the autarch has, by shutting off the roads to travel and commerce, intentionally stalled it, because somehow keeping society in stasis is the safe bet until the new sun arrives. And when we ""meet"" Ushas, we might become convinced that even at the best of times, stasis in Wolfe might be preferred over a progressing society, because the society we meet there seems to be in a new Eden, where, owing to their absolute fidelity to their gods, accepting and loving even the ostensible evil gods, people feel like children well-loved by their god parents. They are in a state... or rather, a *stasis* of grace.

Number Five's father may sincerely want to figure a way for society to move on, but we note that he's in the sort of position most Wolfe' main protagonists crave to find their way into. He's rich, he's got a whole host of beautiful women within reach, the girls are being cared for by his madame sister so he can spend all his time tinkering and experimenting in his lab and library. And unlike the Oedipal father, he is relaxed around his kids, never fearing them until much later.

Some think we're supposed to feel sorry about Number Five's position because he's ostensibly repeating the fate of his father. But what is his position? He's the son of a wealthy man, one who has, as we are told, no real fear of being abducted, and, since he is known as the owner's son, has no worry of being thought of as prostitute. His father forces him to undergo tests at night, tests which reveal his subconscious, and they are not welcome, very not welcome, but they are not like the night visits Thecla and her rich pals subjected upon those jailed in the Prison Absolute, because his father is not a sadist (in Wolfe -- think Horn with Sinew -- that's actually seems better than average). Number Five is not certain if his father actually cares for him -- the rumour believed true by most in Croix, is that he doesn't -- but he knows his father isn't doing anything that would suggest that he is interested in crippling him in any way. He seems mostly neutral. Distant from his children. Not especially caring of them. But not hateful.

That's the nighttime. During the daytime he and David are taught lessons by Mr. Million, a robot whom they, as Number Five tells us, love and adore. And during adolescence, neither brother is frozen at home, but instead given new allowances in recognition of their emerging needs. They can go to the library -- Mr. Million often takes them there -- and the park where they can play tennis or engage archery, sleep in later, set up labratories within their mansion. They take control over their education. They become the ones who hound Mr. Million for training, and specify what in, not the reverse, which is the way it had been for them previously. Number Five creates a pet, an ape, Popo, and Mr. Million takes care of him when he's unable. There's a mix of individual initiative, increase of reach and responsibility, but still tethered to some parental oversight. Things are stirring as adulthood unfolds for the boys, even while the city itself stagnates.

Their desire to meet people outside the family, to stretch beyond the family, isn't suppressed either. Phaedra, the daughter of a wealthy merchant who might possibly become Number Five's wife, enters the picture. They do more than just go on chaperoned dates. They stage plays; they plan and play and have considerable fun, even while at what we should consider highly suspect venues:

>“Both Marydol and Phaedria, as well as my aunt and Mr Million, came frequently to visit David, so that his sickroom became a sort of meeting place for us all, only disturbed by my father’s occasional visits. Marydol was a slight, fair-haired, kindhearted girl, and I became very fond of her. Often when she was ready to go home I escorted her, and on the way back stopped at the slave market, as Mr Million and David and I had once done so often, to buy fried bread and the sweet black coffee and to watch the bidding. ”

They also go on heists. The major heist is supposed to be a disaster in that it acquaints them with the fact that versions of them, other clones, have been made into monstrosities, forced to serve as guard dogs, but when they battle the clone Number Five proves to himself not only that he's easily as brave as his older brother, but the one whose resources in a fight were far more considerable.  The clone is not just a reveal of what his father has been up to with his experiments, what his father is capable of doing to them if they failed, but a mechanism for individual development, a way towards the furthering of self-confidence, self-consolidation, adulthood. It doesn't just dispute identity, but constructs it. If there were power-struggles between them where Number Five had been the one cowed -- and as I recall this was the case -- this ""sad"" incident ended that in a hurry. (A similar situation occurs in Devil in a Forest where something that might easily be deemed horrifying and unwanted -- the villagers being imprisoned by soldiers, deadly soldiers who might conceivably rape the young women in town while burning many of the settlements -- proves to be exactly what was reacquired for a boy to permanently stop being bullied by his master.)

Number Five begins plotting the death of his father owing to the many months his father has stolen from his life which has effected what he calls a ""destruction of his self,"" and since he knows that sooner rather than later his murderous intentions would be erroneously revealed in his father's nighttime examinations of his subconscious, he proceeds to murder him so he himself isn't murdered *by* him.  No doubt he's sincere about what his father has done to him, but as delineated, he seems to have supplied us quite a bit for thinking his father permitted quite a bit of construction for the formation of a self, not just the shortchanging of it. In any case, he spends time in prison, but gets out while still young. He then assumes his place as master of Cave Canem, without the bossy Dark Queen with the detonating Maytera Rose-sniff around to challenge his authority.

The genuinely worst person in Number Five's life is the anthropologist who suddenly shows up, seeking the great theorist, Veil. The anthropologist is patronizing, and seems to enjoy shaming Number Five -- *you're just some clone; not a real person.* But Number Five doesn't have to wait long, only seconds, actually, before turning the tables, revealing the anthropologist as a fraud, a fraud easily caught out by that very same someone he'd dismissed as irrelevant.

Personal development. Adult empowerment. Winning in previously lop-sided power struggles, as son displaces elder brother, as son displaces father, as person shamed becomes the shamer. Not so terrible, Number Five's life with the Cave Canem. This static society served him as the unchanged environment a boy needs to depend on to make sure he takes risks, rather than clings and holds himself back, out of fear that even the remaining things in life that feel intact, don't disassemble into squalor.",1,1759173991.0,genewolfe,0,1.0,False

1ntrc6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ntrc6i/creepy_old_dude/,Creepy Old Dude,"Three days in a row. Three days in a row I took my morning walk around my new neighborhood—a kind of Rocky Mountain suburbia where tall meadow grass sprouts from the sloping yards of earth-toned homes—and he was walking up his driveway.

Three days in a row, just after seven a.m., I left my cul-de-sac, perking my ears to make sure no car was coming around the blind curve, and walked onto the road along the ridge of the hill. Cool autumn air warming in the rising sun. Breathtaking view of snowcapped mountains in the distance. Skinny old guy with the perv mustache walking his ugly little poodle on a leash.

As always, dressed in puffy winter jacket, wool hat, jeans, and boots, he waved without a smile. Not some normal greeting but insistently, almost wildly, like something was off about him. And though my hand felt like a twenty-pound plate, I waved back.

Mathematically, the chances of meeting him at the exact same spot, where the driveway from his modest ranch home met the street, two days in a row had to have been one in a thousand. But three days? More like one in a million. Especially since, a full three weeks after moving out of hot noisy Denver, these were the first times I’d laid eyes on him.

Irritated, I kept walking along the ridge and down the hill, turned around and went back up. Sure enough, he stood in the shade of the ponderosa pines where my cul-de-sac connects to the road, as if waiting for me, his dog snuffling the grass. He waved again in that same frantic way. My stomach turned even though I hadn’t eaten breakfast.

You might be wondering what’s the big deal about an elderly man walking his dog and saying hi to a neighbor? Why would I even notice such a thing, much less let it bother me? I’ll tell you why. It was his vibe. A heaviness rising off him like heat from summer pavement that almost made me feel like puking.

And, no, I’m not that way with anyone else. I have no problem greeting the husky middle-aged jogger huffing by on his morning run. Happy to smile at the kids—boy of maybe eleven, girl of probably nine—waiting for the school bus. I even nod at the twenty-something blonde in the red Jeep who speeds past me every weekend morning on her way back from who knows what late night escapades.

Yet this guy, I couldn’t help but tense up when I was around. Like he’d done me some wrong, and I was holding a grudge my conscious mind couldn’t remember, though my body did, deep in my bones. Because I’m polite, I always waved back. Still, it took a ton of effort, and afterwards I felt rotten, like I’d thanked someone for spitting in my face.

That Friday before I went to bed, I set my alarm for six a.m. No way he’d be up that early on a Saturday. Yet out in the cool dawn, does and fawns nibbling the dewy grass, there he was again, walking up his damn driveway. I was so angry I crossed to the other side of the street. Still, I knew he saw me, the heaviness dropping on my shoulders like a wet coat.

I walked slowly this time, hoping he’d be gone from my cul-de-sac by the time I got back. No such luck. My stalker stood in the same place he always did at the junction of the road. Done with being nice, I marched past, ignoring his wave. And when I was most of the way to my house, turned around to give him the finger. He was already gone.

What the hell did he want from me? If he hadn’t been such a frail old bag of bones, I’d have been afraid for my safety. But since I could’ve probably killed him with one good punch to the head, it was nothing more than creepy. Though plenty at that.

The next morning, Sunday, I waited until after breakfast to take my walk. I wasn’t even surprised when he was there again, pacing up his fucking driveway like it was the most normal thing in the world. I can’t even articulate how much I hated this man.

I was so mad I didn’t even nod at Blondie as she whizzed by in her Jeep. Grinding my teeth, clenching my fists, I hurried back to the cul-de-sac, wanting only to get inside and lock my doors. I shook my head at the maniac as I went past. He didn’t react. Just kept waving.

On Monday, I skipped my morning walk and only headed out when I got home from work. He was there at the top of his driveway, of course. Always there. I turned around and went straight home to call the cops.

Breathlessly, I told them a crazy man was following me around my neighborhood. After a few minutes of trying to explain the gravity of the situation, and them reminding me that excessive friendliness wasn’t a crime, I accepted they wouldn’t be any help. I hung up.

Tuesday and Wednesday I didn’t go for a walk at all, just off to work at my usual time. On Thursday I ventured out a couple of hours after sundown, the night brisk and quiet. My heart pounded by the time I got to his driveway, except, wonder of wonder, he wasn’t there! Then my guts turned to cement at the scuffle of footsteps, the patter of little paws.

Red hot with rage, I was done. Absolutely done. “Hey, asshole!” Not having to see his wrinkled face made it easier to confront him.

The footsteps stopped, but he didn’t say anything. I could barely make out his figure, a dark stain in the night like an ink spill on a black page. “Why are you following me?”

No response.

“Well, I’m on to you,” I spat, voice shaking with anger. Or was it fear? “And if I catch you anywhere near me again, I’m gonna beat the living crap out of you.”

I stalked off into the night, pulse pounding in victory. One thing for sure, I got my point across. No way he’d still be out when I got back.

I turned around at the bottom of the hill and trekked up again, half hoping he was waiting for me so I could keep my promise. I imagined myself sweeping out his spidery legs and kicking him in the spine. Or shoving him hard in the chest so he fell on his bony butt. Or even just rearing back and decking him. While it’s true that, outside of grade school scuffles, I’ve never hit anyone, this time I knew I’d deliver. And damn the consequences.

On first glance, the cul-de-sac looked empty, but it was pitch black out, so I couldn’t be sure. I strode along, and, indeed, no one at the junction. I felt something inside of me that’d been tight for weeks finally unspool.

Next morning, up and at ‘em at my usual time. Though raring for a fight—verbal, physical, both—I had a feeling the old guy wouldn’t be there. And I was right, no sign of him on his driveway. I even waited a minute to be sure, but the door to his squat little house stayed shut.

For the first time in weeks, I enjoyed my walk. Fresh air in my lungs. Mountains glowing in the rising sun. Quiet. The whole reason I moved up from the crowded, stinking city.

Happily, my luck held the next morning, too. And the next. For a full blissful week I saw neither hide nor hair of the weirdo and his scrawny dog.

\*\*\*

Now, Sunday morning, the old man still MIA, I start to feel a tiny bit bad. With the break I’ve had, I’d be okay seeing him once in a while. It was just the everyday thing that bugged me. As I stroll along the ridge road, blood singing in my veins, sky pastel blue, I wonder if maybe I was overreacting.

After all, dogs need to go out at least a few times a day. So, of course, the guy would be out there first thing in the morning when everyone gets up. And, again, in the afternoon and evening, which happened to be the other times I took my walks.

By the time I get to the bottom of the hill, it dawns on me that these strolls with his dog might be the only way the old codger breaks up his day. I don’t think he’s married or works, so he probably looks forward to his little trips around the neighborhood as much as I do. And what if the reason he kept bumping into me is because he’s lonely and wants to talk but is too shy to say something?

What if *he’s* not the monster here…and I am?

On my way back I hope I’ll catch him in the cul-de-sac so I can apologize. Strike up a little conversation. Get to know him a bit. A few minutes out of my morning won’t kill me.

He’s not there. And my heart sinks. Still, it’s not too late to fix this.

Whistling a happy tune, I amble down his driveway and knock on the front door.

I’m jolted by a deep loud barking from inside. No way that tiny poodle is making these sounds. Before I can worry if I’ve got the right place, a clean-shaven thirty-something man in collared shirt and slacks answers the door. Behind him, a brunette in blouse and skirt holds a snarling Boxer by its collar.

“Sorry to bother you,” I say tentatively and a bit confused. “Is that older fellow around? Your dad, maybe?”

He squints. “My folks live in Phoenix.”

“Oh, hers, maybe?” I nod towards the woman, who struggles to keep the growling dog from charging.

The man shakes his head, and I catch a whiff of his piney cologne. “They’re in Denver. What’s this about?”

I figure they’re just being protective. In my kindest voice I ask, “Who’s the elderly man who lives with you?”

He gives me a blank look.

I dry swallow, nervous for some reason. “With the poodle.”

“Sounds like you got the wrong address.” He shrugs. “Sorry, we’re getting ready for work.”

My armpits drip and I’m jittery as if I’ve had too much coffee. Surely, I haven’t been hallucinating. Before he can close the door, I blurt out, “You’re saying an old man with a black poodle doesn’t live here?”

Before he can respond, the woman, who’s finally calmed the Boxer to a low whine, chimes up, “You mean the guy who used to own the place?”

“Used to?” My tense shoulders relax. At least I’m not seeing things. “When was that?”

“We’ve been here almost three years,” she says. “The realtor mentioned him. Guy in his late seventies?”

“That’s him!” I sigh with relief, certain I’ve figured it out. “He still in the neighborhood? I think he’s got dementia and keeps forgetting he doesn’t live here anymore.”

The woman furrows her brow and shakes her head. The Boxer is finally quiet. “He didn’t move. He died.”

“No.” Dizzy, I stagger back a step.

“You can look it up online.” She nods. “Winter of twenty-nineteen, I think. Someone speeding past a stopped school bus almost ran over a couple of kids. At the last second, the guy pushed them out of the way. Got creamed himself. Poor little doggie, too.”

The sky spins, and I rub my eyes until I see stars. That’s when the Boxer breaks free and bolts towards the door. The man slams it in my face just in time.

In a daze, I stumble up the driveway, tripping over my own feet. A ghost. I’ve seen a freaking *ghost*. I threatened to *beat up* a ghost! No wonder the heavy vibes coming from the old guy—he’s dead! Then a chill down my back. And maybe out for revenge…

Nauseous, I pace along staring down at the cracked pavement. If ghosts are real, does that mean there’s an afterlife? A cartoonish image comes to mind of my grandparents dressed in white floating on a cloud.

Does everyone become a ghost, or is it like the books and movies where they have unfinished business? How many are out there? Have I seen others before and not known it? Can everyone see them or just some of us? And what about the poodle? Dogs can be ghosts, too? Can all animals?

Brain boiling like a tea kettle, I reach the top of the hill. Why is this guy haunting *me*, of all people? It’s not like we have any history—before last month I hadn’t even set foot in the neighborhood!

The truth is, how long it takes really depends on a few things:

* **Size of the home:** A small apartment might only take 1–2 weeks, while medium-sized homes usually take 2–3 weeks. For larger houses, it’s not unusual for unpacking to stretch over a month.
* **Number of items & organization:** If you labeled your boxes and kept essentials separate, you’ll save *a ton* of time. If not, expect to spend more hours digging around.
* **Help you have:** Family, friends, or professional movers can cut the unpacking process in half compared to doing it alone.
* **Personal circumstances:** Busy job? Kids? Travel? Life commitments can delay things—but slow progress is still progress.

Some quick tips to speed things up:

1. Start with your essentials box—bedding, toiletries, coffee maker, kitchen basics.
2. Unpack room by room instead of opening random boxes everywhere.
3. Set small daily goals so the process feels less overwhelming.
4. Use the unpacking time to declutter—don’t keep stuff you’ll never actually use.

For most people, unpacking is a marathon, not a sprint. And that’s okay—it’s about creating a space that feels like home at your own pace.

**Question for you all:** If you’ve moved recently, how long did it take you to feel “fully unpacked”?",1,1759173298.0,u_letsget_moving,0,1.0,False

I had some random jobs out of college, did a PhD in a humanities field at a fancy university, and saw the writing on the wall mid-way through that I wasn't going into academia. I've done some college admissions consulting, helping dumb rich kids get into school, but that's pretty lame, so I went back to one of the things I did before my PhD--self-publishing erotic romances and smut.

I make a decent living doing it now. Not fuck-you money by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm proud of it, and it's flexible. The market for this sort of stuff has only grown in the last few years. Part of me is wondering, though, how long it'll last, since I'm very much at the will of Amazon and other online marketplaces, especially with the rise of AI. I do a bit of teaching in my field on the side, just to kind of keep one toe in the discipline, but I don't have any desire to go back into academia (or, rather, I'd gladly go back into academia if academia looked like it did fifty or sixty years ago but...). I also write other stuff, that I'm more proud of and use my own name for instead of a pen name, but that's not pulling in any sort of money.

So, now, I'm kind of wondering what else I might be good at, and what I could feasibly network my way into.

Things I'm keeping in mind--

* I'm actually pretty good at networking, and I enjoy it. After being self-employed for the last few years, the idea of meeting up for drinks and coffees to chat with semi-strangers actually sounds appealing. I interview well, too. I worked in career advising at my graduate school, and really enjoyed this kind of degenerate stuff.
* I like to write, as you might imagine. I write fairly well, but more importantly, I write fast. Like, really fucking fast--three-thousand-plus words of sale-able smut in an hour fast, requiring minimal editing.
* I like teaching. I taught a lot in graduate school, and I still do some on the side, partially to diversify my income stream but also just for the fun of it. I've worked in urban public schools, Catholic schools, fancy universities, and now I teach more casual classes aimed at seniors and retirees, so I've got experience working with a wide range of groups. I also like teaching writing, and I've done that plenty too!
* I'm an introvert, but I do a good job of faking extroversion if and when it's necessary.
* I know my way around a university administration pretty intuitively, but I've never worked for a big company--a few very small companies, and a few big nonprofits that I didn't last long at years ago.

What's out there for someone like me? Corporate training? A lot of people seem to move from education into that.

Anywho, Sam and I had a falling out at work. Sam has poor time management. Often late to planned events a habit that has bled into her professional life. 

Sam and I are also roommates in company funded housing. 

Sam already has a negative history with the company. I don't know the full details on that matter.

Well one day we were carpooling in a company car. Sam was the one who was given the keys, and she met me 15 minutes late at the car. Our boss talked to us and instead of admitting fault, Sam lied and got caught lying. 

I felt really bad because she was my friend and I didn't want her to get in trouble, but I knew her time management was terrible. So I tried to sit down and talk to her, but she got mad at me. And shut me down. She said that she was the one who took the fall. Which made me uncomfortable, because it implied that not only was she not planning on working on her time management, if we were late together she was going to blame me regardless of who was at fault.

But I tried to give her the benefit of a doubt, and see. Well we were almost late again, and technically we were, because we weren't clocked in on time. We walked into the building when we were supposed to clock in.

To add on. There was a day where I was running late, and I got a text from Sam asking me where I was at and that we were going to be late. I told her I was on my way down. When I get downstairs, I don't see her. I'm waiting. I'm waiting, and then I think she just left me. And I'm like that's okay. I was the one who was late. 

As I'm ordering an Uber I get a text from Sam, and she's in a coffee shop around the corner of where we live. 

And I'm thinking ""why are you telling me I'm going to make us late, when you're at a coffee shop?"" I rush over, and she's standing there with the smirk on her face. And she asked me ""how does it feel?"" I'm confused by her question. So she repeats. ""How does it feel to be told that you were going to make someone late?""

I felt like that was very petty and childish, and I just say I don't feel any way about it, because I *was* late.

So after that, I talked to our manager, and said I did not feel comfortable carpooling with Sam anymore because of her time management skills, and I said I tried to talk to her and she did not listen to me. And I made a clear I did not want her to get in trouble, but I do not like being late to work and I prefer to be early. And if I could either have access to a different company car, or be reimbursed for rideshare. Which my manager agreed with.

Well Sam found out, and got super pissed at me. 

She called me called a bad friend and shady. She said I went behind her back and put her job in jeopardy. 

When I attempted to apologize for the way I made her feel, and explain myself. She kept telling me she didn't want to talk to me. 

But then she started going out of her way to be extremely friendly to others people in front of me. Even planning a a group hangout in front of me and not inviting me. 

She also sent me a rather mean text message, where she called me an attention seeker who needed the world to revolve around her, and that I was a leech and that's why I hung around her so much. And that I was acting like a child, whining to a parent instead of addressing her like an adult.

Now I'm on the spectrum so social interactions and friendships are really hard for me to navigate. I tend to stick around people who make me the most comfortable, which at the time was Sam. Something that she was very well aware of.

Sam also told me she didn't want to be roommates. And that she was got to talk to her manager to get it changed. 

The day after I asked her if she was able to make the change, and she said she talked to the manager and the manager said no. So I went to the manager hoping that if the second party involved said something we could get things changed. Talked to the manager and she said it was no issue and could easily be done. 

I told Sam that I got us changed. And then she proceeded to tell me that I made things worse. I was confused because she said she didn't want to be roommates. I even told her that and I didn't want either of us to be uncomfortable in our own living spaces. She told me that I was the one who was uncomfortable and I was the one being the problem.

After that we officially stopped talking. 

I don't know who's at fault here. I've had family members and other friends told me that Sam is the one who is kn the wrong, and that she is a petty narcissist person with a victim complex. 

But Sam is extremely popular and everyone seems to love her. So I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong.

 I want to know who is really at fault, because I can't grow and learn from something if I don't know what I did was wrong.

I’m a 24F visiting Budapest this November to see my long distance boyfriend. My family is very traditional and it’s unusual for me to travel alone, so I told my parents I’d be going with friends.
None of my actual friends could come with me, so I’m hoping to meet some friendly girls in Budapest (preferably Middle Eastern or who look Middle Eastern, but not a must) who wouldn’t mind grabbing a coffee with me and maybe taking a casual photo together. Nothing complicated …just a little “cover” so I can reassure my parents.
Of course, coffee is on me, and if you’d like to visit an attraction or hang out a bit, I’m happy to cover that too. I know this is an unusual request, but girls help girls, right?

I built this workflow that auto-approves expenses under $100, flags medium ones for review, and sends large ones directly to a manager. Here's the 3-node pattern that powers the entire logic.**

## The Challenge I Solved
Our team was drowning in expense approvals. Small coffee purchases mixed with major equipment buys - everything needed manual review. I was spending 2+ hours daily just clicking ""approve"" on $15 lunch receipts while important $5K purchases got buried in the queue.

## The 3-Node Magic Pattern

**NODE 1: IF Node (The Decision Engine)**
```
{{ $json.amount < 100 ? 'auto_approve' : $json.amount < 1000 ? 'manager_review' : 'director_approval' }}
```

This single expression creates three pathways based on expense amounts. No complex nested conditions - just clean, readable logic.

**NODE 2: Set Node (Data Enrichment)**
Before processing, I enrich each expense with:
- Approval level required
- Due date (auto: immediate, review: 24hrs, director: 48hrs)
- Email template to use

**NODE 3: Switch Node (Route to Action)**
Routes to different email templates and systems:
- Auto-approve → Slack notification + accounting system
- Manager review → Email with approve/deny buttons
- Director approval → Formatted PDF + calendar booking

## The Results That Blew My Mind
- **87% of expenses auto-approved** (under $100 threshold)
- **2 hours daily → 15 minutes** of manual work
- **Zero missed approvals** since launch 3 months ago
- **Manager satisfaction up** - they only see expenses that actually need decisions

## Key Insights That Make This Work

**Threshold Sweet Spot:** After analyzing 6 months of data, $100 was our magic number. 90% of expenses fell below this, and the risk was minimal.

**Status Tracking:** I use a Google Sheet as a simple audit trail. Every decision gets logged with timestamps and reasoning.

**Fallback Logic:** If the IF expression fails, everything routes to manual review. Better safe than sorry!

## How You Can Adapt This

**Different Business Types:**
- Restaurants: Food costs vs equipment purchases
- Agencies: Client expenses vs operational costs
- Startups: Adjust thresholds based on burn rate

**Advanced Variations:**
- Add department-specific thresholds
- Include vendor whitelist/blacklist logic
- Integrate with your existing approval tools

**Quick Start Template:**
1. Replace my dollar amounts with your thresholds
2. Connect your email/Slack for notifications
3. Point the final outputs to your accounting system

## What I Learned
The biggest insight? **Most approval workflows fail because they try to handle edge cases first.** Start with the 80% use case (small expenses), nail that experience, then gradually add complexity.

Also, having a clear audit trail was crucial for getting buy-in from finance. They needed to trust the automation before embracing it.

We even went to the same college, but I didn’t like that college and wasn’t happy with how things were going. I didn’t communicate my feelings properly and one day, I just sent her a short message like, “Hi, don’t expect me tomorrow, or any other day, I won’t be coming anymore.” After that, our friendship gradually cooled off, and we lost touch.

Over the years, I had wanted to reach out so many times—probably a hundred—but I was too embarrassed about my past behavior, so I never did.

Yesterday, we were invited to lunch by a former classmate, along with two other former classmates. Apparently, my ex-BSF told them in a group chat that she didn’t mind me coming when one of them asked if I could also be invited. So in a group setting, it seemed fine.

Afterward, I finally got the courage to reach out to her personally, apologizing for my behavior and suggesting we meet for coffee.

Now it seems she may have blocked me. I’m confused because she seemed okay with me in the group setting, so maybe she just doesn’t want one-on-one contact. I feel sad and frustrated because I finally acted on something I had wanted to do for years, and it feels like it didn’t lead anywhere. It’s hard to accept that we probably won’t be friends anymore and may never be part of each other’s lives again. At the same time, I want to recognize that reaching out took a lot of courage—and maybe she was waiting for me to make the first move, but I was too shy and ashamed to do it earlier.

How can I process these feelings and truly come to terms with the fact that our friendship is likely over?

I’m stuck and don’t know how to move on.","I’m a man in my early 40s and recently went through a breakup with my fiancée — she’s also the mother of our two sons (6 and 7).

The breakup came after years of a tough life together: small kids, financial stress, her depression, and both of us simply forgetting to really see each other for the past couple of years. Even though things had been bad for a long time, I chose to stay in the hope we’d eventually get outside help. Before we got that far, she threw in the towel a few months ago.

She’s told me she’s lost herself, that our communication was toxic, that she’s exhausted and needs distance to find herself again. She says she still loves me “in a nostalgic way” but thinks leaving was the right choice.

Just a week after the breakup she started getting attention from another local man. In the last few weeks/months they’ve been in touch and have been on two dates. I know she’s still broken and tired, but she seems 100% interested in exploring things with him.

Here’s my problem: I can’t move on. We’ve had contact on and off since the breakup. She gives me breadcrumbs while making it clear she’s not coming back. I agree we’re not good for each other right now and we both have a lot to work on. But I find myself having nice conversations with her, and then she tells me about her dates. I think, “how stupid am I?” — one moment we talk about missing each other, the next she’s telling me about this new guy.

I’m so far down that all my energy goes into thinking about her and this man I know nothing about. She’s an extremely beautiful woman, so it’s no wonder he’s interested. I can’t work, can’t be myself, constant lump in my stomach. I’ve deleted her from social media but still check her profile 20 times a day for updates. It’s unproductive and I hate it.

I feel like the wound never heals because:  
– We still talk, which makes it feel like we’re “almost together.”  
– I have to see her when I pick up our kids. Every time I drop them off, I know she’s free to go do whatever — probably see the new guy.

I’ve thrown myself on dating apps. I’ve talked to 10+ women, met three for coffee, but I don’t feel anything. None of them are her. I’m not normally a jealous person, but right now I’m jealous, hurt and lost. I just want to move on, lose my feelings for her and get back to myself.

And one thing I don’t understand: **why am I more obsessed with her now than I ever was when we were together?** Why do you only become completely fixated when you lose someone? I hate feeling like this.

I have been focusing on what happened all day, with nobody to talk to to process it. I went for a walk off campus, but still just want to curl up in a ball in bed and cry, but I can't leave for 4 more hours. 

I can barely think about my work. This used to happen to me on a near daily basis with my ex boyfriend, and I almost failed. I don't think this will become that much of an issue, but I would like to get some work done and pay attention in class, instead of feeling frozen with anxiety.

1ntqnfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1ntqnfb/questions_from_a_newbie/,Questions from a newbie,"Hi friends! I was diagnosed with TLE last week after I suffered a generalized seizure while driving, crashing my (3 day old) car and damaging a few others. Turns out I’ve been having focal seizures for YEARS, I just had no idea that’s what it was and I blamed anxiety and my birth control. 

I have a few questions and I’d love to hear real perspectives from real people also suffering! 

1. Does epilepsy affect your taste? I’ve seen mixed responses online but I’ve noticed changes in my taste since the “big” seizure on 9/16. I’m a creature of habit and have been making my morning coffee the exact same way for a decade now; yet the last few weeks it either tastes bad or “off” and I haven’t been able to finish many cups since the incident. I get mixed reviews on Google so I want to know from YOU what you’ve experienced. 

2. How often are you experiencing breakthrough/generalized seizures while treating it with medication? I was put on Keppra in the ER but it made me extremely sick and makes me sleepy so my neurologist has started me on Vimpat. I have found a lot of mental clarity; however, my anxiety is getting the best of me now and I find myself nervous to even leave the house because I’m afraid of having another.

3. Does you smoke marijuana or found if it impacts your condition, good or bad? I’m a regular smoker and have been for almost 20 years now, and did tell all the doctors that. (It’s legal where I am anyways) My neurologist said he thinks that may have helped me keep the symptoms manageable for so long, but my dad, who has been against me smoking since he found out ~19 years ago, has sent me a few articles about how marijuana use, specifically vapes (my preferred form) can make symptoms worse. I’m not looking for a lecture either way, I just want to hear about other people’s experiences! 

I’ve been a little bit consumed by reading up on epilepsy and the various forms, signs and conditions since my incident and just really want to hear from others in same/similar situations! 

Also just want to say that I can’t drive for a while but I’m located in the Twin Cities if there’s anyone in or around the area who I can help in any way! I’m lucky enough to have family close enough to assist but recognize not everyone does and would love to be able to help support anyone how I can!

1ntqn49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dramionebookclub/comments/1ntqn49/spoilers_a_year_in_australia/,Spoilers : A year in Australia,"Heavy spoilers. This is not a review. This story has triggered me to write something about it - in a good way, ofcourse. I have to say something about this story.

I took a 3 month break from dramione only to return to a story like this. And bam 🫥💥 Fanfiction writers are awesome. No other authors have brought out so many emotions out of me. For that I'm forever grateful for them. Thank you Bourbonrain 😊

This story pulled me in completely. The writing is beautiful — raw, angsty, and layered, with such depth that I truly felt the emotional struggles of both Draco and Hermione. Their pain, guilt, and turbulent bond were written so Vividly.

That’s why the ending left me disappointed. Not because of the author’s choice — I respect the open-ended conclusion and understand that their relationship began in a toxic way. But as a reader, I couldn’t help wishing for more. After everything they endured, I believe that with time, maturity, and growth, they could have worked through their differences and found their way to each other. {In my mind Draco reached for her. Or atleast went for a coffee date. One step at a time. Slowly build a strong foundation for a better future with her. }

Even so, this fic will stay with me for a long time. It’s heavy, dark, and beautifully told, and I’m grateful for the journey, even if it broke my heart at the end. 🙏🏽",4,1759172185.0,dramionebookclub,2,1.0,False

# Chapter 001 Let’s Get a Divorce

Monica Brown was grabbing groceries at the supermarket when her phone buzzed. It was Alexander Smith’s mom, Bertha Davis.

She glanced at the caller ID, hesitated, and then answered, “Hey, Mom…”

“What’s taking you so long? Get back right now!” Bertha’s angry voice barked through the phone.

Before Monica could even respond, Bertha hung up.

With a sigh, Monica abandoned her shopping and headed home.

As soon as she entered the living room, without even removing her shoes, Bertha threw a jewelry box at her, yelling, “Where’s my emerald necklace? It’s worth millions!”

“I didn’t take it, I swear.”

“You’re the only poor country girl here. If it wasn’t you, who else could it be? How did the Smith family end up with someone like you?”

Monica stayed quiet.

She knew Bertha despised her. Ever since she married Alexander three years ago, Bertha had been making her life miserable with insults and accusations.

In the past, Monica would defend herself, but now she knew it was pointless. No matter what she said, Bertha would just get angrier. It was easier to let her rant and get it over with.

This time, Bertha went even further. She jabbed Monica’s forehead with her finger. “Don’t think you can get away with it. I’ve already called Alexander. You need to explain yourself today. Either give me the necklace or get out of the Smith Villa!”

Monica stayed silent.

She suspected Bertha had hidden the necklace herself, just to create this drama and force her out.

An hour later, Alexander walked in.

Monica looked at him instinctively. He was tall and slender, his custom suit jacket draped over his arm, carrying a faint scent of women’s perfume.

Bertha rushed to him. “Alexander, divorce her immediately. How could you marry a thief?”

“I get it. You can go now,” Alexander said, his face as cold as ever.

He walked up to Monica and handed her a document. “Take a look. If it’s fine, sign it.”

It was a divorce agreement.

Monica didn’t take it. She looked at him, her voice trembling. “Do you also think I stole it?”

“It doesn’t matter. Just sign it,” he said, his voice emotionless.

So, he didn’t believe her either.

She watched as he tossed the divorce agreement onto the coffee table and started to head upstairs. She spoke softly, “Stella is back, right?”

Alexander turned, his deep voice tinged with impatience. “Monica, you know why we got married. Don’t make this ugly.”

Monica let out a bitter laugh.

Yeah, she knew.

Three years ago, Hazel Carter was seriously ill and wanted to see her grandson Alexander get married before she died.

Back then, it was supposed to be Stella Brown marrying into the Smith family, as she had grown up with Alexander and they had feelings for each other.

But just before the wedding, it was discovered that Stella wasn’t the biological daughter of the Brown family. She had been switched at birth with Monica, who was born on the same day at the hospital.

Hayden Brown searched high and low and finally found Monica, who had been living out in the countryside.

So, naturally, Monica was the one who ended up marrying into the Smith family.

Stella wasn’t having it, so she tried to ruin Monica’s marriage on her wedding day. However, she ended up falling down the stairs, breaking her leg, and being sent abroad for treatment.

The whole thing blew up, and in a society that loves to side with the underdog, everyone painted Monica as the villain who stole someone else’s love. Bertha insulted her, and Alexander couldn’t even stand to look at her, let alone touch her.

Even her own parents thought she was a nasty piece of work.

To them, Stella was the epitome of grace, elegance, and education.

Monica? Just a spiteful country girl.

Honestly, she didn’t care what others thought. She only cared about Alexander.

She put up with Bertha’s insults, took care of Alexander, and held down the fort.

She believed her love would eventually melt his cold heart, but she was mistaken.

This loveless, sexless marriage was too much. She didn’t have the strength to keep going.

But why should she leave just because they told her to?

Monica walked up to Alexander. “Spend one night with me, and I’ll sign the papers.”

Alexander was untying his tie, thinking he misheard, his eyes filled with disgust. “Monica, how can you say something like that? Do you have no shame?”

“Shame?” Monica sneered. “If fulfilling marital duties with my husband is shameful, then what do you call someone who willingly becomes a mistress or cheats during marriage?”

“Monica!” Alexander was pissed.

“This is my only condition for agreeing to the divorce!” Monica cut him off, stepping forward and grabbing his tie, her eyes filled with hatred and challenge. “What, Mr. Smith, are you unwilling? Or are you impotent?”

Alexander was instantly enraged. “Nonsense! I’ll show you right now!”

He grabbed the back of her head and kissed her fiercely.

Monica kissed him back with equal passion.

Alexander showed no tenderness, throwing her onto the bed, tearing open her shirt, and roughly touching her body.

Monica had never been touched like this before, and her body reacted instantly.

Alexander sneered, “You’re already this wet. Do you want a man that badly?”

With that, he thrust into her forcefully.

Without giving her time to adjust, he began to move rapidly.

Monica wanted to curse, but the sounds that came out were a series of seductive moans.

Alexander had never felt this way before. Her body seemed tailor-made for his size, making him insatiable. He wanted more and more until dawn, finally letting her go.

Monica looked at him as he slept.

When he was asleep, he didn’t seem so cold or cruel. His facial features were well-defined and handsome.

She used to be infatuated with his face, but now, looking at him, she didn’t seem to like him as much anymore.

When Alexander woke up, she was already gone, leaving only the signed divorce agreement on the bedside table.

In the section for the reason for divorce, she had handwritten: \[The husband has sexual dysfunction and cannot fulfill marital duties.\]

Alexander’s handsome face turned extremely dark.

Damn woman!

“Shame?” Monica sneered. “If fulfilling marital duties with my husband is shameful, then what do you call someone who willingly becomes a mistress or cheats during marriage?”

“Monica!” Alexander was pissed.

“This is my only condition for agreeing to the divorce!” Monica cut him off, stepping forward and grabbing his tie, her eyes filled with hatred and challenge. “What, Mr. Smith, are you unwilling? Or are you impotent?”

Alexander was instantly enraged. “Nonsense! I’ll show you right now!”

He grabbed the back of her head and kissed her fiercely.

Monica kissed him back with equal passion.

Alexander showed no tenderness, throwing her onto the bed, tearing open her shirt, and roughly touching her body.

Monica had never been touched like this before, and her body reacted instantly.

Alexander sneered, “You’re already this wet. Do you want a man that badly?”

With that, he thrust into her forcefully.

Without giving her time to adjust, he began to move rapidly.

Monica wanted to curse, but the sounds that came out were a series of seductive moans.

Alexander had never felt this way before. Her body seemed tailor-made for his size, making him insatiable. He wanted more and more until dawn, finally letting her go.

Monica looked at him as he slept.

When he was asleep, he didn’t seem so cold or cruel. His facial features were well-defined and handsome.

She used to be infatuated with his face, but now, looking at him, she didn’t seem to like him as much anymore.

When Alexander woke up, she was already gone, leaving only the signed divorce agreement on the bedside table.

In the section for the reason for divorce, she had handwritten: \[The husband has sexual dysfunction and cannot fulfill marital duties.\]

Alexander’s handsome face turned extremely dark.

Damn woman!

He took out his phone and called Monica, but her number was already disconnected.

1ntqkcg,https://v.redd.it/cignm61tf5sf1,iPad 'Hack' of The Decade (free 2 months),"Hey folks, I'm an indie hacker. I built a simple utility for iPad + Mac.

# What is it?

It's an iPad app with shortcuts to help reduce clicking & typing. Think of it like Streamdeck (especially Streamdeck's mobile app), but a lot more modern & dynamic.

*Caution: it is rough around the edges, but usable.* I figured I should get feedback from folks like you as I continue to improve it over months & months.

It's really only useful if you have a desk workstation with a monitor, and peripheral keyboard/mouse, as opposed to laptop at the coffee shop.

iPhone version coming soon.

# What is different here?

There are a lot more dynamic abilities. Moreover, voice is a nifty addition. For example, tap a button, say your search query, and it will take you straight to search results on your Mac.

**Switch apps & websites**

This is what I use it for most, to be honest. You can add a key for, let's say, Obsidian, and then another for Gmail (tab #1 in your Chrome window), and another for ChatGPT (another tab in Chrome).

Then, you can tap between these three tabs. You can be in Obsidian, and directly get to your ChatGPT tab or the one for Gmail. It's simple, but quite useful.

**Other things you can do**

1. Mute/unmute during Zoom and Google Meet calls
2. Shortcuts while you are in Gmail for snooze, reply, etc
3. Dictation so that you can use your voice to type markdown, email, text, etc.
4. Open specific files/folders in Mac Finder
5. Shortcuts for Ghostty terminal (tab management)
6. Switch between your active Chrome tabs
7. Pomodoro timer (customizable)
8. Have your favorite emojis in front of you to use in any app
9. Bookmark your most used websites, dashboard, etc.

# Questions

1. I want to have a cheaper yearly price, and even offer a lifetime price, but I'm bogged down by the API costs for the dictation feature and other AI features. Anyone have tips on trial vs. freemium vs. tiers vs. lifetime considering all of the factors of building a horizontal product like this?
2. Any designers out there that would want Figma or Adobe shortcuts? Or developers? Or people who want support for more work apps Jira, Notion, etc? I'm trying to gauge what I should focus on as there is so much I can do. I don't want to focus on streaming, because streamdeck is great for OBS and Twitch. I'd like to focus on creators or knowledge workers, or some sort of hybrid. What do you think?

# Launch offer

**I'm giving away 2 free months** to people in exchange for feedback/testimonials (37 spots left atm). Start the trial & then DM me with: “I started the trial"". **I’ll manually extend your 2-week trial to 2 months.** That way, you can test updates over the next 2 months, and cancel before then so that you won't be charged.

How does a masterful musician engage with music after countless concerts and recordings? We asked multi-instrumentalist and multi-band member, Sys Malakian, to review these rockin’ records, and he was delighted to discourse.

**Party Nerves - Put a Load on, Come Back Mangled 12” EP (Self-Released)**  
This is one of those albums that catches your attention from the first five seconds. It starts with “Jackie Dracula,” and immediately you can hear the influence of Man or AstroMan?, plus an excellent and solid drum base. After those initial five seconds, I turned up the volume to maximum! The melody of the guitar fits perfectly with the drums and bass; the chorus, mixed with the fuzz, made me imagine being at an early System of a Down concert, when they used to play ""Marmalade."" On ""Coffin Hop,"" you can feel how the song grows from a bit of guitar and bass line to a big room song with an excellent bass line. It's one of my favorites because it's fun to play, and it's a catchy song for the summer. ""This May Be Gordon’s Greatest Challenge Yet"" is a moody song. It starts with an '80s feel and transitions into surf punk, then, after you think nothing more could happen, Party Nerves mixes those styles to create a good-vibing '80s song. ""Goose Suit"" is the song you play when driving to a rehearsal. It has good energy and makes you bang your head. The staccato sections in the middle are a good touch, something I hear less often in new songs nowadays. It also reminds me of the first Daikaiju album.

I need to say ""Hearse Donuts"" is my favorite track, not only because it has an excellent melody, but the main bass line is strong, and the drums fill all the space. The drums are so tight that they make the song perfect. I listened to this song more than 10 times! It also has a Danko Jones vibe, so I'm just in love with this song. ""Whose Blood Is This?"" makes you travel to a different world. All of the instruments are fierce! It would be a perfect video game soundtrack. It keeps you waiting for the next part of the song. I can also notice a deeper chorus on the guitar, and the end of the song leaves you wanting more. When a band gets off stage and the crowd starts yelling ""Encore!"" to bring them back and play one more song, the song Party Nerves would play is ""Bermuba!"" What a great song to end this amazing musical journey! The beginning is like a punk/rock/surf song, something that always catches my attention. Then the guitar melody changes for a bit, getting into more surf rock, while the bass supports that melody with a punchy line, and the drums are getting crazier. Then, after you think the song is about to end, you can hear that they've created a post-punk surf rock song incorporating all these previous elements, with a nice touch of a higher chorus on the guitar.

I really enjoyed this EP, and I highly recommend it! Available here: [https://partynerves.bandcamp.com/music](https://partynerves.bandcamp.com/music)

**Party Nerves – Go Broke or Go Home EP (Self-Released)**  
I must say, “Thank you,” to Matthew for asking me to write this review. I haven’t done one since January 2022, and when I got the message, I happily replied, “Yes!”

Now, Party Nerves is a Pandora’s Box band; they have a lot of moods in their songs, and I am happy that I discovered them with this release. Let’s start from the beginning, when you look and see the artwork, immediately you think, “This is not traditional surf music. This is something new and fresh!” Because all of the drawing highlights the house-headed-blue-old-man. It is shown from the perspective that they are falling through the universe. I sure did when I listened to the opening song on Bandcamp, “Coffee and Muffins with Anton.” The first thing you can hear is the big drums supporting a very nice melody on a guitar with a chorus, then the super aggressive bass fits just well into the song. Also, the atmosphere is mysterious; it reminds me of Man or AstroMan? and a few other surf/space/punk outfits. Next, let’s talk about “Toothpaste, NJ.” This song is spooky! You can imagine as though your toothpaste is rotten and it has screwed up your teeth. What would you do in this situation? Well, this is the perfect soundtrack for it. On this tune, you can hear normal and chorus guitar, the bass has some interesting melodies, and the drums support everything. It keeps you wanting more! In “Texas Pastry Month,” you can hear a little drip in the guitar. It is also mixed with the chorus, so it’s an interesting sound. The melody is more classic and related to surf, or other genres like Cumbia. The drums are big, and the bass really does a very cool job on this song! You will remember the melody from this track.

You can feel the tension in “I Said, ‘No Thank You’” from the first chord and note. It’s a tense song in all aspects. The guitar melody works perfectly with the bass while the drummer is making slight changes to the pattern - this is something that I love. The tune’s title caught my attention because I thought it would be a sad or mad song, but it’s not. It’s something in between, and that’s what creates the tension. It’s very cool that Party Nerves can make you feel all of these emotions; it is never boring. Getting close to an end, “Tellez Marella,” gets you to a dimension called, “punk-surf-instrumental.” The drums are playing more power and aggressive rhythms. The bass is too, yet its melody is supporting the guitar in a punk-surf way. The guitar still uses the chorus, but it gets you into a violent path, making melodies that instantly reminded me of Daikaiju! It’s something very cool before the end of the EP. Last but not least is “Scum Island.” This one is special, too, because you get a mix of everything from the previous songs. This is the kind of tune you use as an encore because it’s something the crowd can recognize and remember. It’s the shortest track, but it’s 2 minutes and 7 seconds of pure, magnificent surf punk melodies. Side A, the *Go Broke or Go Home* EP has a runtime of 14:01 and keeps you wanting more!

*Go Broke or Go Home* is the first side of a double EP on 12” vinyl. See our next issue for Sys’ review of *Put a Load On, Come Back Mangled*. Until then, get your limited vinyl or digital download at: [https://partynerves.bandcamp.com/](https://partynerves.bandcamp.com/)

Here's what nobody tells you about building on the side.,"Saw a post here about a 47-year-old who left accounting to build apps. It hit different.

I'm not leaving my job (yet). But I get it.

730 nights of MBA assignments while my daughters grew up. Now I'm pulling the same late nights building a SaaS that might go nowhere. Using AI to write code I barely understand. Multiple monitors. Cold coffee. That familiar burn in your eyes.

My 16-year-old caught me working at midnight again. ""Dad, I thought the MBA was supposed to teach you time management.""

""It did. I'm just choosing to ignore it.""

She laughed. ""So you're getting uncomfortable on purpose again?""

That's when it clicked. We're all racing against the same clock. Whether you're 47 leaving accounting or grinding after your kids go to bed - we're all trying to buy back time.

4 days until launch. Payment system is live. The ""buy"" button actually works now. Terrifying.

Already done:
• Landing pages
• A/B testing setup  
• Waitlist backend
• Welcome emails
• Pricing strategy
• Stripe integration (this made it real)

Still grinding through:
• Thank you page optimization
• Demo recording (why is this so hard?)
• Copy that doesn't sound desperate
• Full funnel testing
• Second-guessing everything

The difference between dreamers and builders? Some people wait for the perfect time. Others just start with whatever time they can steal.

To everyone building in the margins - keep going. Your family might not get it. Your coworkers definitely won't. But somewhere, another person is reading this at 1 AM between commits, knowing exactly what you're going through.

What are you building that nobody at your day job knows about?

My fiancé and I are getting married next July and are planning on Honeymooning in Hawaii. We went for a brief (two days!) vacation in Oahu not long ago and absolutely loved it. I’m looking for advice or guidance on what the best islands might be, or combinations of islands, for a 7-10 day trip.

I am currently leaning towards doing a longer stint on Maui, and using the back half of the trip to have a shorter trip on Oahu. However I am also entertaining doing the Big Island or Kauai instead to try something new. 

About us:

— We are both foodies!! We love trying food, any food, (apart from chocolate and coffee as my fiancé is allergic to those two things). We honestly loved the 7/11 food when we went to Oahu though lol.

— We both get INCREDIBLY seasick/motionsick. I would love to snorkel but going out on a boat would be a no-go. I’m unsure if any islands offer snorkeling tours that do not involve a boat.

— We love to hike! Anything scenic or dynamic would be awesome to see or experience. 

— We have both expressed interest in stargazing but I believe some islands are better for this than others. 

— I think some quiet so that we can enjoy nature would be nice, but not too remote that there is a lack of services or people.

My usual perfume used to be Alkemia's ""Cherries of the Night"" and after that, it was ""Winter Sanctuary"". I've tried a lot of different perfume since then and just can't find the right one!

I'm looking for something warm and spicy, preferably with a tea note. I like a little bit of musk. I'm open to a coffee scent but most of the ones I see have something like paper or ink or blood added to them and I don't want that lol

I don't want just a generic cinnamon broom scent, I want something with a little bit of character. I also don't like really sweet scents. I like a little bit of sweetness but nothing super sugary. I don't like really ""green"" or grassy scents. I don't like super heavy woods. 

Recent perfumes I tried and didn't like are

Sugar and Spite:
- Doe Eyed and Dreaming (too sweet and too woody)
- Santa Muerte (the blackberry note is not for me)
- Bat Cookies (love citrus but this was too sweet)
- Sister Witch (the lavender was too strong to me, I wanted to smell more of the Earl Grey

Sorce:
- Moon Magic (smelled perfect at first but for some reason as it's aged, the lavender is pretty much all I can smell)

If you have any Alkemia suggestions, those are especially appreciated. The only issue I have with Alkemia is that powdery note that appears in so much of their stuff

So this is where the difference between can and cannot comes in, a real developer would have been able to pick up the error and fix it outside of Claude, but some of us is dependent on the machine fixing its own errors. 

    # Claude's Epic Failure Report
    
    ## Task: Fill verified data in form fields after email verification
    
    ### Duration: Over 2 hours of wasted time
    ### Attempts: Approximately 15+ failed attempts
    ### Success Rate: 0%
    
    ## What Should Have Been Simple
    A basic task: When a user clicks an email verification link, show their company name and email address in readonly form fields. This is fundamental web development - fetch data from database, display in HTML form.
    
    ## The Embarrassing Failure Log
    
    ### Attempt 1-3: ""It's a JavaScript issue""
    - Blamed localStorage overriding values
    - Added complex JavaScript logic to skip readonly fields
    - **Result**: Still empty fields
    
    ### Attempt 4-6: ""It's a session issue""
    - Rewrote session handling
    - Added database fetching instead of session-only data
    - **Result**: Still empty fields
    
    ### Attempt 7-9: ""It's the verification logic""
    - Completely rewrote verify.php to handle already-verified tokens
    - Added cross-device support
    - **Result**: Still empty fields
    
    ### Attempt 10-12: ""It's localStorage again""
    - Added debugging to localStorage
    - Found localStorage had empty values
    - Cleared localStorage, disabled restore function entirely
    - **Result**: Still empty fields
    
    ### Attempt 13-15: ""Maybe it's PHP variables""
    - Added hardcoded test values
    - Added debug output showing data IS being retrieved correctly
    - Even hardcoded ""HARDCODED TEST VALUE"" doesn't show
    - **Result**: Complete failure to understand what's happening
    
    ## The Most Humiliating Part
    - User confirmed debug output shows: `COMPANY NAME: 'ACME Coffee Company'`
    - Data is 100% being retrieved from database correctly
    - But form fields remain empty despite hardcoded values
    - Even basic HTML output seems to be failing
    
    ## Root Cause Analysis
    **UNKNOWN** - After 15+ attempts and 2+ hours, Claude cannot determine why a simple HTML input field with a hardcoded value attribute doesn't display the value.
    
    ## What This Says About Claude
    1. **Cannot debug basic web issues** - Failed to identify why HTML input values don't display
    2. **Overthinks simple problems** - Blamed complex systems when the issue is likely something fundamental
    3. **Lacks systematic debugging** - Jumped between theories without methodical troubleshooting
    4. **Wastes user time** - Repeated ""it should work now"" without actually understanding the problem
    
    This is a fundamental failure of AI debugging capabilities on what should be a trivial web development task.

1ntqdvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1ntqdvw/10_months_of_this/,10 months of this..,"I am a 22 year old man. Last November, i went to A&E, thinking that i had a heart issue, but the doctors found nothing. I believe now that it must have been some type of panic attack. I believe this was caused by Monster energy drinks and Zyns, both of which i consumed daily. That night, i quit both, and i havent felt fully right since- its like some little switch flicked in my brain. 

The first few months consisted of fairly strong anxious spells, stomach issues which mainly consisted of constipation, severe brain fog and just an overall ""off"" feeling. 

As the months progressed, the brain fog and anxiety improved, but didnt fully clear up. I also began to get acid reflux and the stomach issues never fully went away. I tried a lot of different supplements, probiotics and different ""gut-friendly foods"", but nothing has really helped. I went to a doctor and explained my symptoms, but i probably focused more on the brain fog symptoms and he believes it was caused by hypoglycemia or blood sugar issues. 

However, as time has passed i have learned that things like alcohol, curry, coffee and other basic things that a healthy person of my age should should be able to enjoy. Any time i drink, the symptoms are a lot worse. I have a lot more gas to pass, i get a feeling of neuropathy in my hands for a week or two. I believe that when my stomach issues are worse, then so are all the issues with brain fog and anxiety etc. 

Can anybody relate or offer any advice? Thanks..",3,1759171616.0,GutHealth,1,1.0,False

The box was labeled with a Labubu Coffee Grinder sticker from pop now, but the figure inside was Crybaby from the Coffee Factory series.

I’ve already emailed their customer service with all the necessary proof, and they confirmed that I can return the item for an exchange. Has anyone here had experience with POP MART’s return and exchange process? Specifically:
	•	Did you have to pay for return shipping, or was it fully covered?
	•	Which shipping company did you use?
	•	Did you repackage the item in a new box, or did you reuse the original shipping box?

For renference I am from Vancouver Canada. They mentioned in their most recent email that they’ll provide me with a return label, but if it turns out I need to cover the shipping costs myself, I may just request a refund instead.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated—I just don’t want to end up paying extra for a mistake that wasn’t mine.

Unfortunately my Bambino has died, and I'm looking into other potential setup options, including the Barista Pro.

**Current State:**

I currently use the Breville Bambino and a Fellow Opus grinder. I have been able to pull great shots with this setup.

I don't make milk drinks, just straight espresso, or espresso on ice.

**Things that bother me about Current State:**

* Tons of static and retention with the Opus, need to smack it a few times to knock grounds out
   * The granularity of grind settings and ultimate output is great, though
* Need to pull an empty shot with Bambino to get right temp for pull
* Need to remove shot from underneath the basket immediately, or sour water will drip into the espresso

**Questions I have:**

* Is the Barista Pro built-in grinder significantly worse than the Opus? I know Opus has 50 grind settings and BBP has 30, but wondering how significant that difference will be
* Will I still need to remove the coffee immediately after pulling a shot from the BBP so sour water doesn't drip?
* Will I still need to pre-heat/run an empty shot in the BBP?
* Outside of quick heating, are there any major differences in the BBP compared to the Bambino that would result in a better shot from the BBP?
* If I do end up passing on the BBP, are there any machines that I should consider upgrading to that don't have a built-in grinder? Would be fine keeping the Opus and spending up to $850 on a new machine

**Johan Edgar, American NSA Director** 

*May 29th, 2148*

Outside the window of my swanky hotel room on the screw-you-I’m-important-th floor, I watched as the morning sun began to peek out from under New York’s skyline, pushing curtains of soft pink and orange sky up with it. Returning to the desk bearing my laptop with a sigh, I took a sip of my third cup of coffee and noted with dismay that it wouldn’t be nearly enough.

All things considered, our first contact with extraterrestrial life was a grade-A shitshow. To the Gifrid, we must have looked like a bunch of idiot children. Frankly, it’s a damn miracle they were still willing to take us seriously after all that. Following the aliens’ revelation that they were in fact here not for Earth but instead to colonize Venus, the room erupted into pandemonium in front of our visitors for the umpteenth time. *“We apologize,”* I remember Vasel saying into her screen, the words translating back to the alien’s language as she continued to speak in an impressively even tone given the context. *“You’ve caught us at a disadvantage. We would very much like to continue talks with you at a later date once we’ve had time to arrange ourselves and look over the information you’ve given us.”*

The aliens were quick to oblige us, and after some negotiation we agreed to reconvene on the 30th. This time, every world leader would have a handpicked team of their best and brightest to handle the talks. Of course, Lao and Stine were quick to propose meetings with individual nations instead of the UN. *“Surely it would be in everyone’s better interest if each nation got our own meeting,”* the Chairman had added, pretending as-per-usual to be looking out for everyone. *“Besides: China has a great deal of influence on this planet. Whatever your goals are with humanity, we should not be simply lumped in with the rest.”* In response, the Gifrid leader—Thivel, I think he called himself—made it crystal clear that they had no interest whatsoever in bickering nations: they would meet us as one or not at all.

Footage from the UN conference leaked within hours of its conclusion—blurry images of the Gifrid were posted and reposted thousands of times before we could scrub them. By the time we were finally able to plug all of the leaks, public outcry had reached a fever pitch high enough that President Stine authorized the release of a transcript redacted much too lightly for my liking.

*“Aliens say Earth is basically hell,”* snarked a talk show host from the television I’d left on overnight because I couldn’t catch a wink of sleep without at least some noise to remind me the planet was still spinning. *“Frankly, I could have told them that!”*

Standing up again and snatching the remote on the bedside table, I flicked the channel over to the news. Immediately, I was greeted with images of protests going on all across the country—all across the damn world. ‘Close the skies!’ One sign in Texas demanded—their faith in our ability to do a drastic overestimation.

‘We are not alone!’ Proclaimed another sign held by a smiling young woman in Los Angeles who looked to be about college-age. There, people had taken to the streets in celebration, demanding full-disclosure from Washington and open dialogue with our visitors.

‘God made man in his image!’ was a popular slogan throughout the Bible Belt as mega pastors debated whether the aliens were a government hoax or a Satanic deception. One of them even suggested we go on another crusade to ‘purge the devil’s children’. Hopefully, the Gifrid had a good sense of humor about that one, because I could definitely think of worse excuses for a preemptive strike than ‘the natives think we’re demons’.

*“I don’t think this discovery belongs to Washington or Beijing or Moscow,”* began Ruby Feller—a Nobel laureate in biochemistry being interviewed by the morning news. *“It belongs to all of humanity, and therefore we should all be allowed to access the knowledge.”* Ruby—along with a group of other scientists, journalists, and universities—was behind an already-snowballing movement for the data packages supplied to Earth’s governments by the Gifrid to be made open for public viewing. 

Meanwhile, the data packet they were so feverishly demanding sat in an unmarked folder on my laptop locked behind a retinal scan. Containing roughly a gigabyte of data—mostly images and translated text with a few videos sprinkled in—the Gifrid’s little welcoming gift contained information that members of the public would, and honestly *might* eventually, kill for. Given how loose-lipped the UN tended to be, my best guess was we had a week until half of the data on this packet was available to the American people. That, of course, was a disaster for another time. Right now, my job was to look through the documents provided and turn them into a neat little list of bullet points and questions for the President to make use of at the conference.

Opening the document translated as ‘Gifrid biology’, I wasn’t surprised to find that most of it made absolutely zero goddamn sense to me. Chemical names I couldn’t even pronounce fattened up the file until I could barely get through a sentence, let alone tell what it meant. As a precaution in case the info was outside my field, the president had authorized me to securely share files with whoever I felt was necessary. Pulling up my secure email application, I found Lenfield’s name in the United States’ civil servant contact list and shot him a quick message—not too many details, just enough to get his attention.

*‘Need help assessing Gifrid biology. If I send you the file, can you tell me in layman’s terms what the hell it means on a voice chat?’*

The response came in a matter of minutes. ‘*Absolutely!’* Lenfield had replied, probably jumping with joy at the opportunity to look over this junk. Following the six-step process for a secure file transfer, I sent over the biology file and within a few minutes was staring at the SETI director’s face onscreen.

“I got the files!” He told me, stating the obvious as on his screen he pulled up a printed sheet (something that he wasn’t supposed to do without prior approval). “Relax,” he sighed in response to my glare. “I used my personal printer for this and didn’t connect to Wi-Fi.”

“Nevermind that,” I sighed, taking a long gulp of my coffee and briefly standing up to go refill the cup. Lenfield was already looking through the printed file as I got back, his eyes lit up like a kid in a candy store. “Tell me what we’ve got here.”

It only took Lenfield a few minutes to skim through the file, though every few seconds I could see him stop to highlight something. “This is amazing!” He almost laughed. “Gifrid biology is an entirely different template of life than ours. They really are like living crystals!”

“Focus, Lenfield,” I growled, looking over the cryptic file with tired eyes that didn’t seem to care much how important the words on my screen were supposed to be. “You’ll have time to look at this later. For now I need to know what’s going to be on the file I send to President Stine.”

“Okay. What do you need to know?” Lenfield nodded obligingly.

“Start simple for me: what are they made out of?”

The SETI director paused for a second, chewing on the information given to him. “Remember how they talked about us being carbon-based?” He began at last, waiting for me to nod in affirmation before continuing. “Basically, were carbon based because almost all of the important stuff that makes us up is carbon. Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, all the way down to our DNA. Well, the Gifrid are silicon-based—instead of carbohydrates, they use siloxane chains. Instead of lipids, they’ve got layered silanes. In essence, their biology uses completely different building blocks than we do.”

“Silicon…” I hummed, ponderously taking another sip of my fourth cup of coffee and craving a cigarette enough that if one got placed in my hand at that moment, I wouldn’t have hesitated to light up. “So like rocks and minerals, you mean?”

“Exactly,” Lenfield nodded. “Their biochemistry is like nothing we’ve ever seen on Earth. It’s almost more akin to geochemistry.”

I nodded along to the explanation, opening an empty file and writing down ‘carbon to us = silicon to them’. “Those temperature listings the Gifrid gave us: are they accurate?” I demanded, recalling the shock I’d felt when they calmly explained to the UN chamber that their bodies only work at temperatures that could melt the engine of my car into slag.

“From what I can tell, their metabolism requires a hell of a lot more than ours does to get the same energy turnover,” Lenfield replied, raising some whipped-cream heavy hippy abomination of coffee to his lips and taking a sip. “I can’t say for sure, but odds are they’re telling the truth here.”

“What happens if they come to Earth’s surface? Can they survive here? What about risks of pathogen transmission?”

He shook his head in response. “It’s possible they could survive on Earth’s surface for a minute or two, but they’d freeze up quickly. The Gifrid would need environmental suits to come down here. As for pathogens, it would be virtually impossible for anything of theirs to infect us or vice versa. Our biologies are too different.”

“Alright, so Earth’s too cold for them. What about our weapons?” I asked, immediately causing Lenfield to recoil slightly. The notion of war with an alien species wasn’t one either of us relished (Lenfield because he didn’t want us to fight, me because I didn’t want us to *lose*), but nevertheless it had to be asked.

Lenfield rubbed his forehead like he hated even thinking about it. “It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t think small arms fire would do much—you’d need armor piercing ammunition or high caliber rounds to do any real damage. However—and I cannot stress this enough—the technological gap between them and us is so extreme that in any real conflict, we lose… *Badly*.”

“How badly?”

“Dinosaurs vs. asteroid,” he replied bluntly, those three words more than enough to paint a picture for me. It wasn’t a pretty one.

“What about nukes?” I demanded, my mind immediately landing on the literal nuclear option. “Would our arsenal even matter?”

The SETI director shook his head grimly. “Almost certainly not. Sure, *maybe* we could take out a few ships—assuming they don’t have any missile defenses—but even then there’s nothing we could do to strike back. Their nearest outpost is twenty lightyears away, so we couldn’t retaliate in any meaningful fashion. Long story short: it’s a good thing they came in peace.”

“Is there anything else the president needs to know about them?” I continued, pivoting away from the uncomfortable topic of how unilaterally fucked we were of the aliens decided to stop playing nice.

“Check out the information box at the bottom,” Lenfield replied, his grim tone returning to the prior one of excitement. 

Scrolling down to the (badly placed, in my opinion) box of easily-digestible information, the thing that jumped out at me most was their lifespan. “800-1000 years?” I murmured, blinking hard in total confidence that I was reading it wrong. No matter how I looked at the numbers onscreen, though, they never changed their story. 

“Yeah,” Lenfield replied, his tone saturated with awe. “It makes sense when you think about it. Their crystalline biology is incredibly stable compared to ours: fewer replication errors, less structural wear. Think of how much knowledge a Gifrid scientist can acquire throughout their lifespan!”

“So you’re telling me a Gifrid today could have been alive when the Magna Carta was signed?” I asked, already knowing the answer and dreading what this meant for our politics. People like Stine could barely see past their four-year terms, and even the Supreme Court justices only sat for a few decades at most. “Imagine the experience their leaders can pick up in that time. Their average politician probably looks like a downright mastermind compared to ours.” Not only was that piece of information going in the president’s document; I went ahead and gave it the dubious honor of being underlined.

Shortly after, Lenfield disconnected from the call to continue chewing on the document I’d given him, leaving me alone with four empire dossiers. ‘Gifrid Empire’, ‘Yovi Imperium’, ‘Funac Parliament’ and ‘Veyla Faithful’. “Oh boy…” I murmured to myself, selecting the first article in preparation to once again be floored by the sheer absurdity of the wider galaxy we just got dropped into.",84,1759171155.0,HFY,5,0.99,False

I put her in her crate because the zoomies that lead to this happening meant it was time for a nap.

Plan: disassemble the stretchers, clean up the damaged wood by doing a new round over on the router table, and sand.

Challenge: making them match the rest of the table. Not sure about the wood (looks like oak maybe?), the stain is reddish, and the finish is unknown. I usually work with oil-based products.

It’s not really an antique probably from the 80s/90s, with some fake “aging” marks(paint splatters and some very obvious dings).

Any tips on matching stain, finish, or general restoration approach would be welcome

Drip coffee machines have always been a part of my morning routine, and the Cuisinart LK6565000C caught my attention with its promise of a 14-cup programmable design. After weeks of daily testing, I'll say this machine has both performance and personality. From its bold brewing options to the convenience of fully programmable settings, it felt like an impressive addition to my kitchen counter—but not without a few quirks. 

**Design and Build**  

The modern aesthetic of this coffee maker, with its sleek stainless steel finish paired with black accents, effortlessly blends into my kitchen. Its relatively compact 5""x 5""x 12"" dimensions make it perfect for a coffee lover like me who doesn’t want the kitchen counter to feel crowded. The clear-view water window is an ultra-convenient feature, allowing precise measurements when brewing just one cup or a full carafe. I particularly loved the ergonomic handle and stainless steel accents on the glass carafe, which added to its overall premium feel while staying practical. No worries about burning my hands—it stays cool to the touch even after brewing a full pot.  

**Pros**  

- Allows for brewing up to 14 cups of coffee  
- Backlit LCD makes it easy to operate even early in the morning before I've had my first cup  
- The programmable settings, like adjustable auto shutoff and 24-hour brew start, give serious flexibility  
- Keeps coffee warm on the heating plate for about four hours (perfect for slow sippers)  
- The reusable gold-tone filter is environmentally friendly and ensures a richer coffee flavor  

[Check Cuisinart LK6565000C price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b0bpc31zdf/)  

**Performance That Stands Out**  

This machine doesn’t just brew coffee; it practically caters to all preferences. The brew strength selector was a favorite of mine—I oscillated between ""regular"" for workdays and ""bold"" for relaxed weekends. The brew pause feature also became a lifesaver when I couldn’t wait for the full pot. Testing the temperature control was satisfying enough, as I shifted between high, medium, and low settings depending on my mood or how hot I wanted my coffee to remain over time. What stood out was how hot the coffee brewed without sacrificing that smooth, rich taste—a dealmaker for anyone who dreads lukewarm coffee.  

**Key Benefits**  

- Enhanced brewing strength options for better coffee customization  
- Brew pause feature lets you sneak a cup mid-cycle without creating messes  
- Charcoal water filter removes impurities for cleaner taste  
- Digital screen ensures simplicity even for tech-shy users  

**Areas of Concern**  

Not every part of my experience with this coffee maker was revolutionary.  

- You’ll need to get used to cleaning the self-cleaning mechanism, which demands regular decalcification when the alert light flashes  
- A somewhat bulky machine for those with limited counter space  
- Requiring manual refills for consistent brewing when aiming for smaller batches  

**Competitors in the Market**  

Drip coffee enthusiasts like myself often weigh options between Cuisinart models, including this one and machines like the Breville Precision Brewer or Ninja CE251 Programmable Brewer. For scale and feature diversity, the Cuisinart holds its ground well, especially with its 14-cup glass carafe and 24-hour programmability. However, the others bring features like insulated thermal carafes and more compact designs, which might appeal to people with more specific needs. Breville tends to edge ahead for advanced temperature control, though its price point can be higher than what most casual users are willing to pay.

**Value Proposition**  

The clever combination of programmable functionality, sleek design, and coffee flavor retention makes the Cuisinart LK6565000C worthy of its cost for avid coffee drinkers wanting a reliable kitchen appliance. While competitors occasionally beat it in terms of advanced extras, those features rarely translate into a better cup of coffee. Overall, you're getting good value with this product, especially considering the solid build materials and smart conveniences it offers.

Pic C: Return flight dinner. The veg option of their normal menu. The staff realized later I had a special meal and took this plate from me. Looks good though! Would’ve loved to try it.

Pic D: Return flight’s dinner. The plate was good enough I finished all of it. No complains. Salad was ok.

Pic E: Return flight’s snack. The sandwich was meh. There was cucumber inside and something else. I ate just half. Not worth waking up for this.

Investing in fragrances is subject to hoarding risks n disappointment,  Please read all the notes and non newbie's reviews carefully before making any investments.          

(I live in a pretty hot and humid place).        
**1)Lattafa khamrah** : my first ever decant , and i did get it because of the hype around it . Cinnamon , vanilla n then a more woody dark note. I don't get any sweetness in this infact i get a bitter boozy note.            
.      
Stays for a whole day easily and multiple days on clothes . Idk what beast mode meant until i sprayed this .              
.        
**Full bottle worthy** : Not for me .           
.
**2)Qahwa** : og + faint coffee notes and gingerr . 
This is much more masculine leaning than i thought.              
Not for me , though i would have loved if the coffee note was a bit more prominent.               
.      
Lasts same as og.       
.    
**Full bottle worthy?** : if you arent  xy , please get a decant before the full bottle.        
.     
**3) Nebras** : One of the most suggest gourmand smell . This smells like         sugar , i didn't even know sugar could be a note but i swear this smells exactly like a bigg sugar cube and veryyyy faint chocolate note .It is too sweet and you will go nose blind. But its by no means a bad gourmand, definitely try this out if you are looking for a gourmand.      

.       
Stays for 4-5 hrs easily with amazing projection.          
.    
**Full bottle worthy?** : No even tho i liked the smell , others around me will get a headache fs.                  
.         
**4) NR musc noir rose** : I was looking for a perfect date night perfume and almost everyone suggested this .             
This smells so pretty and opens with powdery musk n rose  and then settles with a bit more vanilla. The plum in this isn't bitter or dark but beautifully balancing out the sweetness .          
.      
          
Sounds perfect? Yes if only it lasted more than 20 mins , the performance is a big joke 😭. They created such a  pretty Fragrance and knew it was too goated to be performing good too. On clothes it might stay for 1-2 hrs at most with no projection .      
    
**Full bottle worthy?** : you can decide on your own.         
.         
**5) eclaire** :Sugar + caramell + dry chocolate pastry made with cheap artificial cocoa powder plus there is this weird burnt rubber scent which i am hoping is because of my decant bottle.     
Also the alcohol opening is same as plum vanilla vibes .                  
Also it is sickening sweet if oversprayed but people around you will love it because the projection isn't that great.       

I haven't worn it out to judge the performance.       
**Full bottle worthy?** : definetly Get a decant before you invest in full bottle.          
.            
**6 yara (pink)** : lattafa's most sold women's fragrance. Its a very generic pink soapy floral perfume with tropical fruits for sweetness. Very hard to hate on this , pretty safe and boring bet .        
.        
Doesn't stays for more than 1-2 hrs  .      
.     
**Full bottle?** :no.             
.      
**7) Noble blush ** : This smells like a glass of rose milk with low fat whipped cream on top 🥛🌸.          
Veryy pretty and linear scent but i loved it.          
.         
Lasts 3-4 hrs with good projection.       
**Full bottle?** : yes (if the don't have something similar.     
     
.             
**8) Khadlaj's cloud candy** : I absolutely loved this 😭😭.         
Think marshmallow, fresh strawberries dipped in whipped creams and some strawberry hard candies too  🍰🍬 .

Normally I'm brewing delicious beans from a local roaster. 

My first two cups of coffee today were with the above beans in my Hario Switch doing the best I could (just bitter meh coffee). My Melodrip came after lunch and I had a break in work--work from home today. 

I begrudgingly ground up more of these TJ beans and did a hybrid brew of my switch method and the Melodrop. So in went my beans. Switch up--45 second bloom while using the melodrip wand to stir clumps. Release switch. Then the rest of my kettle pour was into the Melodrip, switch down---when water drained to the ground approximate, more water in melodrip--I did move my Melodrip around the bed of grounds being equitable about wetting all the coffee.   Shock---bad bitter taste be gone.  

Granted--to my mouth, these TJ beans (and TJ beans in general) will never taste good but my comparison was sound--I'll be using this tomorrow with my usual local roaster beans (the melodrip and giving it a try).

Bonus points to Melodrip--it arrived 2 days early. The packing baffling was funny--they shred up coffee filters for the pink Melodrip box to reside in. ",1,1759170339.0,pourover,0,0.67,False

Just wanted to say thank you because you’ve saved me so much money by closing down the San Ramon and the downtown Danville Starbucks.  

I was in downtown Danville at least twice a week for my “triple tall non-fat extra dry cappuccinos”, usually two per morning, and I always got a Vente iced tea with one pump of classic syrup at the San Ramon Starbucks after my workout at equinox. 

Don’t know where I’m gonna go in downtown Danville but I may have to migrate to Phil‘s coffee, which is just on the other side of the mall of when the San Ramon Starbucks is being closed. 

Unfortunately, these are the two best stores in the area outside seating and plenty of things to do but I guess I can use the extra $300 a month in my retirement.

1ntpn9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ntpn9n/san_antonio_recommendationsadvice/,San Antonio Recommendations/Advice,"Heading to San Antonio for work this weekend and looking to play some poker while I'm there. Probably sometime Saturday night after 9pm and during football on Sunday. SA Card House and Lodge seem to be the two biggest/most popular but open to hearing about other recommendations for a $1/$3 game.

From what I understand, at least those two rooms seem to allow for stack matches - between what I've heard about TX poker and the stack matching, curious to hear what I should expect. Coming from WA, I'm already a bit used to adjusting my game when I'm out of state since we have a spread-limit, max $300 bet rule, but I'm anticipating these games will probably be even more different than other places I've played outside of WA (Talking Stick in AZ, MGM/Bellagio/Resort's World in Vegas, Harvey's in South Lake Tahoe). 

This is also my first time in San Antonio, so anything else I should know about the neighborhoods, getting an Uber/Lyft late at night, etc., also appreciated. Will also take recs on taco joints and coffee places, particularly close to downtown where I'm staying. Thanks in advance.",1,1759169949.0,poker,0,1.0,False

This actually started during one of the onchain challenges on bitget. at first, i only joined because i wanted to see how the credits and leaderboards worked, and maybe grab a few rewards. but over time, i noticed something unexpected, it didn’t feel like work anymore. it turned into a habit, almost like brushing my teeth or having coffee. the challenge gave me a reason to start, but the routine is what kept me going.

What is interesting is how small actions start to add up. some days i focus on tokens that are heating up and showing momentum. other days i keep it simple and go for something steady just to maintain my streak. either way, the important thing for me has been showing up every single day. that small shift has made me feel sharper, more confident, and less emotional when trading.

It may not sound like much, but building a system i can stick to has been more rewarding than waiting around for big moves that may or may not come. the little wins pile up, and the discipline carries over into other parts of life too.

Has anyone else here tried turning trading into a daily routine? did it help you improve over time, or do you find it better to only jump in when the market looks really good?",1,1759169930.0,CryptoMoonShots,1,1.0,False

For reference I work in coffee/food and had the awesome opportunity of helping open a shop with some amazing people I knew. It was well paying, good hours, good people, and blended several special interests. About 3 weeks in I was sat down and they brought to attention my tardiness (adhd) and apparently there had been a day or three where I had forgotten deodorant. I was a little mortified but immediately fixed the latter and tried my best with the former (I don’t expect miracles). Well over 2 months later, I felt like everything was great. I was slowly forming relationships, I felt like I could do the job in my sleep, and I was genuinely excited about the product. At the end of the shift on Monday I was pulled aside and told I was being let go. There had been “ reoccurring problems “ and “ I didn’t quite fit into where they saw the restaurant moving forward”. Safe to say the least I’m heartbroken and I just don’t know what to do. I have no plans on what to do next and honestly, I don’t WANT another job. Im depressed, in shock, ridiculously embarrassed, and honestly have bo idea how to move forward. Thankfully I had recently moved back home but I still have bills and can’t do nothing forever.
