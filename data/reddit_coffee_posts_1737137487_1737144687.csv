He went out to the post office and asked if I wanted a coffee or anything and I said no. 
He then goes and gets himself a takeout chicken sandwich and didn’t ask me if I wanted something from the restaurant while he was there.
I’m upset that he didn’t ask me while at the restaurant but he says I should have asked before he left. But I had no idea he was going to get food, so I wasn’t going to ask him to go out of his way to get me some food. 

I wouldn’t go out and get myself lunch and not think to check if he wants anything before I order. If he’s worried about the cost I would have paid him back and he knows that, buying me some food would have been zero extra effort for him. 

He’s now saying things like
‘Oh you’ve never eaten a meal by yourself without asking me if I want something’ 

It’s just annoying every single time I go to the grocery I ask if he wants anything and he doesn’t think of me when he gets himself food.

Then on the third week I upped it to 100mg and since then I have honestly never felt worse, with huge bouts of anxiety and this really sick feeling. There is a bad strain of flu going around so I am not sure if I have caught that or if it is the test that is causing the issues.

1i3p6if,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualChemistry/comments/1i3p6if/we_are_now_loyal_friends_with_this_intense_sexual/,"( we are now loyal friends with this intense sexual tension) - “I could feel his energy swirling around me, engulfing me.  I’m confused , he isn’t my type and has a reputation of being a player . ","We met at a party about a year ago. We danced at the end of the night, and I could tell he thought things might go further. But I don’t do casual, so I went home—and forgot about him.

Months later, he reappeared in my friend group. I feel this electric charge in the air when we are around each other . It is thick, almost tangible, and people around us noticed too. It scared me. So, I ignored him.

He’d always compliment me, always know where I was in the room. months later, he finally made a move—asked me out on a date. But before the date, we were out with friends at rave , ended up kissing on the dance floor, and I went home with him. I regretted it immediately. It was raw passion, sure. Hungry. Hot. But it lacked intimacy.

Then we went on that date. He was glowing, protective, trying so hard to make me laugh. He dropped me off at home, and things got heated again. (For context: I’ve always been drawn to powerful men, and I was getting attention from this influential older guy at the time. This guy? Younger. Hot. Life of the party. Not my type at all.) After that, I didn’t text or call him.

He started flirting around with other girls— I wasn’t jealous, but I felt embarrassed in front of my friends. So, when he got close later, I declined. The week after, I officially friend-zoned him.

He didn’t take it well. There was a frustrated, angry phase where his childhood friends were clearly aware of me (so, he’d been talking about me to them). But I brushed it off.

Here’s where things get complicated. Over time, he became a loyal friend. He once showed up in my neighborhood, and we hang out—grabbing lunch, walking to the park, lying under fall leaves, just talking.  I have always felt completely comfortable and safe around him. . I rested my head on his chest platonically. (I know…) and watched the sky / birds . He walked me home, and of course, I didn’t let him upstairs.

We visited a sick friend together and spent more time together, and I realized how much I enjoy his company. #####
That evening , while walking to the subway, I felt air between us was thick again, like a scene straight out of a movie—swirling winds, fallen leaves, and silence heavy with tension. intense and eye opening.. 


Something wild happened that evening . I could feel his energy swirling around me, engulfing me. We got on the subway, laughing like teenagers, people-watching, seeing the city blur by. (We’d smoked a joint before, so that added to the vibe.) I had to remind him of his stop, and honestly, by then, I was afraid of losing my carefully built control.

Fast forward to last month—it marked a year since we met, and he remembered. I let my guard down. And wow, the chemistry? Unreal. It felt like waves crashing over me—intense, raw, undeniable.

Here’s the dilemma: He has a reputation as a player. That’s why I initially friend-zoned him. And yet, our chemistry is so rare, it feels almost magical.

We met for coffee last weekend, casual as always. One thing led to another—we ended up watching a movie and cuddling. He’s careful now, always asks for my consent. And even though I value him as a loyal friend and don’t want to blur lines, I gave in. The intimacy this time? Incredible. Tender. Sweet. Electric.

Now my friends are telling me this is rare, that I’m making a mistake by holding back. But I’ve been burned before. I’ve put love first and paid the price. This time, I want to be smart, find someone serious—successful, maybe not as attractive, but powerful. Build chemistry slowly.

So here’s my question:

Do I risk it all for the player who might be falling for me? (Yes, his libido is sky-high, and this is NYC, so I know he’s got a roster.) Or do I hold out for someone more serious? ( he says he wants to be serious , have kids - but I need more ) 

For context: I’m 40, he’s 39. I’m an adult, but this feels risky. I don’t want to end up singing Sabrina Carpenter’s- please please - Heartbreak is one thing—my ego another.",1,1737143833.0,SexualChemistry,0,1.0,False

1i3p5ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/fnaftheories/comments/1i3p5ao/this_security_breach_retcon_breaks_the_mimic_story/,This Security Breach retcon breaks The Mimic story. ,"Let me explain. 

As we know, the majority of characterization for Vanessa comes from Special Delivery, the now discontinued AR mobile game. In that game, we receive a bunch of e-mails that explore Vanessa as a character and her relationship/dynamic with the Fazbear **IT supervisor** Louis. Louis has a huge crush on Vanessa, so even after she starts displaying suspicious and concerning online behaviour, he lets it slide, because potential romantic date. 

>Certain words and phrases trigger **red flag reports**, so your last order got **automatically sent to me**: basically anything mentioning 'torture' is going to raise the alarm. If you have any questions about the policy, let me know. We could even get coffee or something and go over all the words to avoid. ...And now I've raised my own red flag! Good thing I'm the one who gets the notification :-)

And then the Glitchtrap virus does get through, because of Louis' negligence. Vanessa (or Vanny) uses credentials \_pizzaplex to get the virus into Fazbear's digital systems.

>Hey, Ness, I haven't heard from you.  I guess you probably know that. Does *\_pizzaplex* mean anything to you? Whoever created those false credentials also used them to override security protocols and allow a data packet through after it was flagged as a virus. I know it wasn't you. I just need to hear you say it. Or write it, whatever. Please just get in touch with me.

Now, I know that this email was never released and is basically cut content but, since Illumix abandoned and took down game anyway, it doesn't really matter. 

But why is any of this important? Well, as I already mentioned, FNaF AR's true story basically revolves around Louis and Vanessa's relationship (get the two together please) as the latter descends into madness and the former is just left confused, but still trying to help. And here is where the problem lies. 

In Security Breach, we get the infamous Retro CDs documenting Vanessa and Gregory's therapy sessions. And it's during the first one, that Vanessa says something really weird and very likely lore-breaking. 

>Sometimes, I talk with Luis. He’s in the **marketing department**. He’s nice, I guess.

Now, this is obviously a huge contradiction to Special Delivery. Louis **isn't** in the marketing department. As mentioned above, he's the IT supervisor and he and Vanessa do a lot more than just talk sometimes. He's basically obsessed with you, girl. Therefore this pretty much **breaks the story already.** 

And what's even more weird from a lore standpoint is that these therapies are very likely happening **at the same time as the events of Special Delivery's emails.** 

>Your performance reviews are good, but a **routine check of your online history** has revealed that you spend quite a bit of time with someone in an encrypted conversation.

Which lines up with Vanessa transferring to the Pizzaplex in the very last CD, so the argument that ""maybe this is happening later in the timeline than SD"", doesn't really work in my opinion. 

But Louis is basically **the reason why Glitchtrap infects the system in the first place!** Again, due to his negligence and crush on Vanessa, he doesn't act until it is far too late, allowing **Glitchtrap** to spread through Fazbear systems. 

Now, to clear up any confusion, I'm not saying that Louis is responsible for the Mimic1 infection of The Pizzaplex. Tales pretty clearly tell us that it was Fazbear Entertainment's installation of the Storyteller that led to the Mimic1 program taking over. 

But, remember: Glitchtrap is a **separate** Mimic branch from the Storyteller and he has to have gotten into The Pizzaplex somehow, because he's very clearly attached to the PQ arcades (which are in the building). Vanessa using those \_pizzaplex credentials and the complex being built very early on (as indicated by HW1), heavily suggests that The Pizzaplex **exists already** at the time of these emails and Vanessa just transfers over (pretty much confirmed by the therapy CDs). It all lines up perfectly. 

Louis' negligence and willingness to ignore the obvious red flags leads to the Glitchtrap mimic variant spreading everywhere. Eventually he spreads into the Pizzaplex as well, independent from Vanny, The Storyteller and Dr. Rabbit, and attaches himself to the PQ arcades in the building. 

However, **none of that can happen** (INCLUDING the released SD emails), if Louis is just this random guy in the marketing department that sometimes talks with Vanessa, because that's **not his job** in Special Delivery. Louis and Vanessa's relationship as portrayed in Security Breach is in **direct odds** with their dynamic in SD, even if you only accept the released emails as canon. 

I don't know whether this was an intentional retcon or (more likely) a result of the terrible story miscommunication between Scott and Steel Wool, but regardless it breaks the story.

The past couple of weeks I’ve noticed my frequency increasing and a few explosive movements. Same again today and that stabbing pain in my lower left bowel 😭. I’ve had that awful cold going round the UK that made me feel awful for about 4 weeks (the immunosuppressants made it a nightmare to shake). Body was under stress from that, and combined with a house flood 5 days before Christmas, and now my car breaking down. It’s not ruining my life (flood hasn’t caused much damage and I fixed the leaky radiator, car isn’t a drama as I take the train/tube to work, plus my fiancée *just* got her first car after passing test). But I think the combo of physical and mental stress has done a number on me.

I’m also fairly confident stress was a strong contributing factor to my original UC. First thing I’m doing is stopping coffee and reducing my fibre.

I’m going to see how the weekend goes, and then Monday (unless I have a very good weekend and feel okay Monday) I’m going to give my IBD line a call (we leave a message for the nurses who usually call back within a couple of days).

So… if you flared after a remission period, how did it go? Was it worse than your original, was it harder to get out of, did you just go back to a past medication that worked or did you try something new?

>A rare glimpse into the mind of one of cinema’s most enigmatic visionaries, DAVID LYNCH: THE ART LIFE offers an absorbing portrait of the artist, as well as an intimate encounter with the man himself. From his secluded home and painting studio in the Hollywood Hills, a candid Lynch conjures people and places from his past, from his boyhood to his experiences at art school to the beginnings of his filmmaking career—in stories that unfold like scenes from his movies. This remarkable documentary by Jon Nguyen, Rick Barnes, and Olivia Neergaard-Holm travels back to Lynch’s early years as a painter and director drawn to the phantasmagoric, while also illuminating his enduring commitment to what he calls “the art life”: “You drink coffee, you smoke cigarettes, and you paint, and that’s it.”

Thank you all for your well wishes the day of my surgery.  On the morning of January 15, I had a robotic assisted total laproscopic hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingectomy and an oophorectomy.  Our arrival time was 6am EST.  

The surgery started around 8 am and ended a little after 9 am. In recovery, I had a hard time staying awake from the anesthesia.  I started to dry heave when I had to get up and try to use the restroom.  I was told that the anesthesia was different from the one I had during my colonoscopy last June.  That one was a breeze.  My husband and I did not leave the hospital until a little after 2 pm.

I do not remember the ride home.  We did not even get my medicines until the next morning.

Day One, Post-Op:

I started my pain meds when my husband got home from picking them up from our local Walmart.  I was prescribed the following:

1/2 tablet Ibuprofen 600mg tab (every 6 hours as needed) *My husband was told we could split the tablets (QTY 30)

1 capsule Docusate Sodium 100mg cap (once daily for 14 days) (QTY 14)

1 tablet Hydrocod/Acetaminophen 5-325mg tab (every 6 hours as needed) (QTY 12)

I did not have much of an appetite, but I did have Ritz crackers and 7 Up.

Day Two, Post-Op:

This morning, I started my HRT:

1/2 tablet Estradiol 1mg tab (once daily) (QTY 15)

I was up at 5 am.  I gave our two cats, Buddy and Lucky, their medicine, which they had with wet cat food in small bowls on the kitchen counter.  Afterward, I washed, dried, and refilled food and water bowls.  I also dumped and refilled two aqua cubes with fresh water.  I used my legs to get to the floor while holding onto something close so that I would not fall.  I will admit, I got tired and cramped up afterward, so I went back to the couch to rest.

For breakfast, I had peach yogurt, two slices of bacon, a piece of wheat toast with grape jelly, and a little coffee with French vanilla creamer.  I am still snacking on Ritz crackers and sipping on 7 Up.

A confession: I brushed my teeth this morning and once yesterday, but I am afraid to shower.  The hospital called this morning and said that it was safe to shower, but the thought of making my incisions wet and possibly worse makes me anxious.  We were told on surgery day that the bandages can come off tomorrow.  I will shower then and let you all know how I do.

A treat: To help with my nausea, the nurse gave me a small lavender inhaler.  I love it!  I have also used it for my anxiety.  I plan to buy some more!

How did you all do with general anesthesia?  Were you all afraid to shower?    I would love to read about your experiences!  Thank you all for being a part of this journey with me. ",3,1737142355.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

today, the supreme court ruled that the upcoming tiktok ban, which will go into effect on sunday, can happen. as such, there really is no hope left for the app unless trump does something, that 270 day extension ends up happening, or bytedance sells(which is probably not gonna happen).

i made a vow to myself that, if tiktok were ever to get banned, i would make videos up until the day of the ban. and, the day before the ban, i would make a farewell video. and i have kept the first part of that vow. in the days leading up to tomorrow, i've been pretty active on tiktok. i've been doing my traditional content and loving every minute of it, just as i have been. two hours ago, i uploaded my final video of my traditional content.

tomorrow, after i've woken up, made my coffee, drunken my coffee, taken the dogs out for a walk, and gotten showered and dressed, i will take my phone, drop it up against the wall, and make my farewell video.

in the video, i will talk about all i have accomplished on this app in the past 4 years. having experiences that i never thought i would. meeting amazing people who have become life long friends. expanding my creativity and having something to strive to improve. towards the end of the video, i will extend my thanks to my viewers and followers to whom i would owe everything. i would never have gotten to the point that i am right now without them. 

and then, that will be it. as quickly as it began, my tiktok career will have come to an end. but if this is the end, i will face it with dignity.

1i3ohpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/1i3ohpd/six_new_restaurants_in_coachella_valley_plus/,"Six new restaurants in Coachella Valley. Plus: Reopenings, a closure and more","Two vacant restaurant and bar spaces on the south side of Palm Springs’ downtown won’t stay that way for much longer.

The end of 2024 came with a flurry of dining news that began when the owner of the recently closed Impala Bar announced he will be replacing it with a new Irish-themed bar called 333 Clover (the bar’s name is an apparent reference to its address at 333 South Palm Canyon Drive).

Owner Jim Hicks wrote that the new bar would offer “a full Irish menu, Guinness and Harp on tap, pool tables and events.”

That announcement was followed by the news that a new restaurant called TOAST’d in PS would be opening in the former I Heart Mac and Cheese space at 190 South Indian Canyon Drive.

A [website](https://toastdinps.com/) for the new restaurant describes it as a place for “breakfast, lunch and late night bites” but contains little other information. The late-night offerings will likely be particularly welcome, however, given the restaurant’s location around the corner from the Arenas Road bar strip.

It is unclear when either restaurant will open, although signage recently went up in TOAST’d in PS.

But while we’re waiting to try those new spots, five other new restaurants opened across the Coachella Valley last month that are offering everything from sushi to sandwiches to British sausages.

Read on for more on them and other happenings in the Coachella Valley food scene.

# [Cravings](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61568547487841)

*102 East Amado Road Suite A in Palm Springs*

This spot is now something of a one-stop shop for espresso, croissants and … haircuts? Sharing a quiet storefront a few steps from Palm Canyon Drive with the Atelier-Raphael hair salon, this cute cafe has both coffee and tea lovers covered. But we dare anyone to come in and try to leave without one or two of the beautiful European pastries, which come in both sweet and savory varieties.

# [Shake Shack](https://shakeshack.com/location/el-paseo-ca#/)

*73-199 El Paseo in Palm Desert*

Forget In-N-Out — one of the East Coast’s most iconic burger chains finally landed in the desert last month. Known for items like the Shack Stack (a burger topped with a large fried mushroom), its crinkle-cut fries and frozen custard, Shake Shack’s offerings are already familiar to countless customers who have visited its counters in airports, malls and a total of over 500 locations throughout the world.

# Wonder

*74-725 Highway 111 in Palm Desert*

This cute daytime cafe serves up a mix of breakfast and lunch grub. The former options include several breakfast sandwiches, French toast, loaded hash browns and a vegetarian bowl, while there are sandwiches and salads for the latter. We noticed what seemed to be a slight British tilt to the menu in offerings like bangers (English breakfast sausages) and salt beef (better known as corned beef) incorporated into some of the menu items. Save room for a pastry from the case full of them (it was a good month for pastry lovers in the Coachella Valley).

# [La Copa Social](https://lacopasocial.com/)

*72-620 El Paseo in Palm Desert*

We’re a little late on this one: This new sports bar escaped our notice when it opened in the former Cowboy Cantina space last October. But it shouldn’t escape the notice of those looking for a cool new spot to watch the big game (and we know there’s a lot of you given the NFL playoffs are in full swing). There’s no shortage of TVs here, and the menu pairs the wings and burgers one would expect to find at any good watering hole with a full roster of Mexican dishes, including fajitas and caldo de birria de res (a birria stew). It’s also been a hub for [special events](https://lacopasocial.com/events/), including DJ gigs and screenings of pay-per-view fights that have been followed by live music.

# [Isla Mujeres](https://islamujeresindio.com/)

*83-085 Indio Boulevard in Indio*

There aren't many restaurants that serve both sushi and Mexican food. But both offerings are on the menu at the city of festivals’ newest restaurant. The Mexican options range from such standard fare as burritos, enchiladas and fajitas to several caldos, “fish stews” and various other fish dishes that can be found in coastal areas of Mexico.

But that shoreside influence can really be found on the extensive sushi menu, which pairs traditional favorites such as Philly and Cali rolls with specialty options such as the Chukis roll: a spicy tuna roll topped with yellowtail, avocado, Ponzu and Habanero sauce. Isla Mujeres also opens daily at 8 a.m. and serves up both Mexican and American breakfast fare.

# [Birba Cabazon](https://www.birbaf10.com/cabazon)

*48-750 Seminole Dr Ste 100 in Cabazon (Inside Desert Hills Premium Outlets)*

Hungry shoppers at Cabazon’s outlet malls no longer need settle for standard food court fare. Birba, the 13-year-old Palm Springs restaurant known for its spacious patio and colorful name translating to “rascal,” has opened a sister restaurant within the Desert Hills Premium Outlets. While the restaurant’s website promises “an entirely new experience of Birba” with “a completely unique menu and style,” diners will still be able to find a few favorites like the Birba pizza, which comes topped with prosciutto, honey and chili oil. However, there are also new offerings such as a lobster pasta and a new lemon chicken dish. Like the original, this offshoot also boasts a large patio with mountain views.

A few other spots recently reopened:

# Tack Room Tavern, Polo Pizza Co. and The Cantina

*81-800 51st Ave. in Indio*

Three of the restaurants at Indio’s polo clubs – [Tack Room Tavern](https://www.tackroomtavern.com/) and [Polo Pizza Co](https://www.polopizzaco.com/). at the Empire Polo Club and [The Cantina](https://www.eldoradopoloclub.com/cantina-restaurant) at the neighboring El Dorado Polo Club – have reopened after extended closures. The website for the latter promises “a brand new menu and refreshing new beverages” but does not include the new menu itself.

# [El Tacolgado](https://www.instagram.com/eltacolgado_palmsprings/)

*231 East Tahquitz Canyon Way in Palm Springs*

This taco shop, which opened early last year before spending much of the remainder of it shuttered without explanation, reopened in December. And its owners say it will stay this way. They also added a pergola to the patio for shade.

# What closed

There’s one less combatant in Palm Springs’ ever-competitive ice cream wars: The [Jus’ Chillin](https://juschillinps.com/) fronting Indian Canyon Drive is no more. However, those looking to cool off won’t have to go far to get their froyo and gelato fix: the second location just a couple blocks away at 155 South Palm Canyon Drive remains open.

# What else is coming soon

[Oceana](https://www.oceanapalmdesert.com/), the Palm Desert seafood restaurant, has secured a liquor license to open a second location at 70-065 Highway 111 in Rancho Mirage. That’s the former home of Talay Thai.

My friend John almost walked away from it without realizing it, and a simple coffee shop conversation saved the day.

**The Shocking Truth About John’s Missed Opportunity:**                                                      Last weekend, I was at a local coffee shop, catching up with my friend John, who started working at a major pharmaceutical company about a year ago. As he stirred his americano, excitedly sharing how he’s still loving the perks of his job (hello, WFH days!), I asked about his 401(k) contributions. ""Oh, I haven't set those up yet,"" he shrugged. ""I'll get to it once I'm settled in."" I nearly choked on my chai latte. Here’s why: His company offers a 100% match on 401(k) contributions up to 6% of his salary. On his $100K package, that’s $6,000 of free money he was about to walk away from. Every. Single. Year. ""Bro,"" I said, probably too loudly for a coffee shop, ""you're literally saying no to a guaranteed 6% bonus!""

Why People Miss Out on Free Money John’s situation isn’t unique. According to [Vanguard’s 2023 report,](https://institutional.vanguard.com/insights-and-research/report/how-america-saves.html) only about 59% of eligible employees take full advantage of employer match programs. The rest? They leave money on the table for reasons like: •	""I’ll set it up later"" (spoiler: later never comes). •	""I need the money now"" (understandable, but even 1% helps). •	""It’s too complicated"" (it really isn’t). By the time we finished our coffee, John had emailed HR to set up his contributions. He texted me later: ""Just got it done. Can’t believe I almost missed out on $500 of free money every month!""

**Quick Tips If You’re Like John**

1. Check your company’s match policy. Many employers offer matches averaging 4.7% of your salary.
2. Start with whatever % you can afford—even if it’s just 1%.
3. Set up automatic increases for when you get raises.
4. Do the math: If you earn $80K and your company matches 5%, that’s $4,000 a year. Over 20 years, with compound growth, this could add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
5. Remember: Not taking the match is like refusing part of your salary.

**A Quick Reality Check Think of it this way:**                                                                             If your employer handed you a $6,000 check, would you refuse it? Of course not! Missing out on the match doesn’t just cost you today—it could cost you your future beachfront margarita moments, thanks to the power of compounding.

**Why This Matters**                                                                                                                  Missing out on an employer match isn’t just about losing free money today. It’s about sacrificing what that money could grow into over time. Thanks to the magic of compound interest, even a $1,000 match today can turn into $20,000 or more by retirement. And let’s be honest—future you deserves a little luxury. Whether it’s travel, spoiling the grandkids, or finally buying that recliner with built-in massage and cup holders, maximizing your 401(k) match today helps make it all possible.

**Take Action Now**                                                                                                                     Don’t let free money slip through your fingers—check your 401(k) today and set yourself up for financial freedom. Your retired self will thank you while sipping margaritas on a beach somewhere. 🌴

For those asking, employers in 2023 offered an average match of 4.7% of salary—check your company policy now!

She says I shouldn't meet female friends alone because she wants to feel the only female figure in my life that's special. 

And I would agree, but some of her requests seem to me too extreme, like she won't like me meeting a female friend and simply going around town and have casual convos, or I couldn't meet her in a bar and eating ice creams because that's what bf and gf do, or I can't offer to pay sometimes a coffee to my female friend because then I would treat her like I treat my gf and she wouldn't feel special.

","(I watched PP's reaction to Samantha Jo's most recent ""vlog"" a few days ago and was moved to write up a recap because there was SO MUCH hypocrisy between the way she views these 2 gorls)

We open with SJ spraying cleanser and wiping down her bathroom sink...Mochelle sneeringly snots: ""Yeah, because she doesn't have people to do stuff for her, she has to do it herself""

FALSE:  SJ has ALWAYS been a total slob, she's made some strides in keeping her kitchen tidier but literally all of the areas of her home, every nook and cranny, closet, room, cupboard that is not visible on camera are huge, cluttered, hoarded MESSES. Always.  She has hired housekeepers, paid to have her dozens of loads of piled-up laundry done, pays people to come clean up the dog crap in the yard, etc So YES, she does have people doing stuff for her.   SJ's shopping addiction is worse than Alex's. She regularly posts ""clean with me"" videos but never finishes even decluttering much less cleaning one room or closet.

""She looks the size of Alex now but she's pregnant""  SJ has regained much of the weight (80-90lbs)  that she lost on glp-1 meds last year and she has a number of serious obesity-related pregnancy complications as a result. Her pregancy is higher risk than Alex's is and it sounds like she's already been scheduled for a c-section.

""She's complaning about acid reflux whereas Alex never complained about anything like that""  (because Alex didn't have acid reflux, so...) ""Sorry, but to me, she just was not pregnant""  LOL, Alex caught hell for any pregnancy related symptoms she had and now PP is slamming her for NOT complaining enough.

SJ strips her bed (and shows a huge hole she tore in a $100 Brooklinen sheet...PP didn't say a word) then puts her bedding it in the washer and holds up a 32 oz can of bougie Ouai Melrose Place Dedtergent (a viral TikTok Item) that costs $38...That's $38 for enough liquid laundry detergent to fill a 1qt milk carton...again, PP doesn't say a word about it. ""We never saw Alex do ANY of this when she claimed she was pregnant""  We see Alex stripping/making the bed and folding laundry quite often, I feel confident that we saw her do it while pregnant. We also saw Alex laundering several loads of baby items while pregnant...using special baby detergent, not highly scented baby detergent PLUS scent beads as SJ is doing.

""She did a LOT of shit for one day, being pregnant""  LOL, wut?  She wiped down the bathroom countertop, vacuumed the bathroom floor,stripped the bed, started a load of laundry and is now folding a load of clothes. Many pregnant women work 8+ hours a day at a traditional job then go home and work a few more hours.  This gorl is literally KNOWN for being lazy...she is 35 weeks pregnant and has posted exactly 13 vlogs, 7 of them were SPONSORED and wouldn't have happened at all if Sam didn't have a sponsorship contract deadline to meet to get paid  (I refuse to count the 2 videos from her PAID appearance on the Tarte Influencer trip to Puerto Rico)  Alex stuck to her longtime schedule and posted 3 vlogs per week thru her entire pregnancy.

SamJo is wearing a schlubby, shapeless, oversized, bland grey  sweatshirt that says ""TIRED"" that isn't doing her any favors, Pissy says the top looks cute on Sam but that if Alex wore it,  ""that would just piss me right off""   SJ is talking about her goal of trying to stay on top of her housework by doing one DAUNTING task a day and admits that her bathroom had been ""filthy"" because she had not cleaned it at all since they moved in (2 months ago)

SJ starts talking about how ready she is for this pregnancy to be over and says her pregnancy has been ""physically annoying""  Let's just take a moment to IMAGINE the shitstorm Alex would have gotten if she had said that HER pregnancy was ""physically annoying""  She has several pregnancy maladies including headaches, congestion, exhaustion and pre-eclampsia...as well as severe depression...(which is one of the hallmarks of her channel, ""Depression"" has always been a side-character on her channel) when all of a sudden WHAM, cut to SJ launching into a 2 minute commercial for the Upside gas rebate app...PP fast forwards thru the spiel without criticizing SJ for ""shilling"" but comments ""I think Alex has talked about that""  (Nope)

Sam talks about getting her nails done and her hair touched up as ""self care"" in hopes that it would cheer her up but it didn't...PP coos in sympathy.  She talks about how much she's going to depend on help from her boyfriend and says she has no idea what to expect after they bring the baby home.  Pissy: ""I think she'll kill it as a mother, I think she'll be great""  (LOL, I'm putting $50 right now on her mother having to come and take care of the baby AND her for at least the first 2 weeks)

SamJo shares that she's 35 weeks pregnant and hasn't packed her hospital bag yet and that she's been stressing and indecisive about it (nobody called her a stewpid heifer, imagine that!)  SJ says she's trying not to stress about TikTok potentially going away (she posts most of her content on TT and makes most of her money there with almost 4 millon subs...which is why she rarely posts on YT any more) but she's claiming that SHE prefers doing longform content (YouTube) but her management is always ""up her ass"" to do short-form.  Uh huh.  She's become even more spoiled, lazy and entitled from from having to put so very little work into her ""job""

Standing in front of the bathroom mirror scratching her ass Sam says ""my butt cheek crease is itchy"" then proceeds to swig mouthwash straight from the bottle...Not one peep out of Moochelle.  SJ opens and ties big knots in the bottom of some ugly green curtains-  PP: ""I like those!  I like the gingham""  (pretty sure she hated the gingham in Alex's nursery)

In the car getting ready to go to Dunkin for a sweet coffee drink, SJ is now complaining more about her pregnancy, she's not sleeping well, she's having pains in her belly and ladyparts, she's having trouble breathing, especially when laying down, and lists all of the remedies that people on snapchat have told her to try- blah,blah, blah...PP: ""She's just so much more honest...and so easy to watch""  LOL, When Alex talked about HER pregnancy discomforts, Pissy said ""it's because you're so FAT, ya heifer!""

Sam talks about ""their"" (her Bf's) dog Piper who is recovering from surgery...the dog ate pieces of one of her toys and the plastic got trapped in her stomach requiring emergency surgery.  Now the dog has to wear a muzzle when she is not supervised to keep her from chewing/swalling harmful toys. This dog also has incontinence problems, she ""drizzles pee"" PP's only comments were ""oh my gawd"" and ""why does the vet want her to wear a muzzle?""  Can you IMAGINE the vulgar namecalling and  screeching accusations if Alex was the one telling that story?

Now SJ is pretty much whining about being too stressed out, having anxiety, being tired from not sleeping, not motivated to film or pack her hospital bag and feeling the need to ""slow down"" even more because she doesn't want to overdo it or push herself...And PP is nothing but sympathetic.   She has to take a blood thinner shot every day until the end of her pregnancy and has finally gotten brave enough to do it herself, she pulls her shirt up to inject herself and PP says ""THAT'S what you call a pregnant belly, Alex""  At the end of her video SJ says ""I love you so much"" and PP replies ""that's nice!  I believe her when she says I love you so much and all that stuff, she's not fake like Alex""

PP proceeds to read a good many comments, the majority of them talk about how difficult prenatal and postpartum depression can be, the uncertainty that overwhelms new parents, how difficult the mental transition to motherhood is after giving birth, how miserable their pregnancies were, how they hated being pregnant and PP has no response.  ""Let me know in the comments if you noticed any other differences between her and Alex, she's pretty much night and day""

The pages have already been written on and I do not want them to stick together and risk them ripping/tearing each other apart when the page is flipped/turned. It has been written in pencil so there shouldn’t be any ink bleeding, and although I’m prepared to have the stain possibly muddy the writing, I still want it to be mostly legible.

I am not concerned with moisture warping the pages, as it is for a project that is intentionally meant to look messy, and I will be eventually removing it from its spiral binding and sewing it into a larger art piece book project. 

Is it advisable to stain/dry all the pages while they are in their spiral binding and touching one another in the stack? Or does that contain too much of a risk that the pages will stick together and tear when dried and separated? Would something like wax paper in between the pages prevent them from sticking to each other? I am able to remove the pages from their binding first and stain/dry them one by one, but that would be so time consuming and take up lots of drying space as I have many pages, so I would prefer to stain/dry all at once while still bound to the spiral. 

TLDR: can I coffee/tea stain and dry all the pages in a pre-bound book at once without risking the pages drying stuck to one another? What is the most efficient way to stain a stack all at once? Moisture warping is not a concern.

1i3o48r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1i3o48r/going_through_realities/,Going through realities ,"About 7 years ago, I had this experience with a being that I would like to share here.

It was a Saturday morning in the fall. It must have been between 7 and 8 in the morning when I woke up.

My wife had already gotten out of bed and was making coffee in the kitchen downstairs, and I decided to stay in bed a little longer, enjoying the lazy weekend.

I was lying on my side, with the door that leads to the balcony of my room at my back and, therefore, facing the door that leads to the hall between the bedrooms and the stairs.

I could hear the noises she was making as she put the coffee water to boil on the stove when I felt the mattress of the bed sinking substantially behind me.

I was scared at first, because there was no way anyone could have entered the room through the balcony door due to the height of 2 stories above the ground floor.

And as soon as I thought about turning around to see what might be happening, I received a very clear direct communication, both visual and ""auditory"", in my mind. 

It said that although I was not allowed to look directly at the being that was there, I should not worry because everything would be fine. 

At the same time, I received this vision of a being, lying right behind me, who was already inserting his right hand into the center of my back (yes, as if he had ethereal hands that could penetrate my skin and flesh) and in the next instant closing his hand around the central vertebrae of my spine. 

At that moment I felt a very cozy warmth expanding from his hand tied to my spine to the rest of my body. And then he said: ""I have something to show you, but only if you agree to continue with the experience"". 

Perhaps due to the almost ecstatic feeling I was in, I decided to trust that unknown being and allowed him to continue with what he was there to do. 

Suddenly, although I was still in my bed, the scene changed rapidly.

I could no longer feel the being behind me, my son and daughter came running into the room and jumped on my bed while screaming and making a mess, asking me to get up to have breakfast with them.

At that moment I thought: ""How crazy, I was just dreaming, even though it seemed so real!!""

As soon as I made a move to get out of bed, the scene suddenly changed again, returning immediately to the previous one, that is, when that being was still connected to my central nervous system.

And he immediately said: ""Calm down, we're just getting started, are you ready?"".
I nodded once more and then he told me to get up and go to the kitchen to give my wife a good morning kiss.

I did as he suggested, however, as soon as I left my room, I was surprised to realize that although it was the same house, the color of the walls and the furniture were different from the ones we had chosen when decorating the house.

Even so, I went to the kitchen to meet my wife, but when I kissed her, I immediately found myself in my bed, as if I had just woken up, once again, from a strange dream.

I got up and repeated the whole process again, but soon I realized that I was momentarily living in a time loop, in which this small period of time, the time between waking up, going to the kitchen and kissing her repeated itself two or three more times, but each time it repeated itself, several aspects of the house's decor became different from the previous one, as if I was experiencing different possibilities for the same theme.

At the end of this crazy loop, after the third or fourth kiss, everything went back to how it was at the beginning, normal? Definitely not!!! 

There I was lying on my bed again and connected in the most unlikely way possible with this being.

Then, once again he said: ""It's not over yet, there's one more thing I'd like to show you, can we continue?""

I think it would be normal at this point for me to think I had gone completely crazy, but strangely the opposite happened, everything seemed the closest I had ever come to reality, although a reality superior to what we are used to.

As soon as I told him we could continue, I was immediately transported to a cabin I'd been to before, on a property owned by my brother's father-in-law, in another state (we live in Brazil), about four hundred kilometers from where I live.

There was that Being, next to me, told me to look out the window at the back of the property and asked me: ""Do you recognize this place? Tell me, where are we now?""

As soon as I answered him, we were transported back to my room, exactly as the two previous times, interconnected!!

He asked me: ""Did you like the experience? Tell me, what did you understand from what you experienced today?""

I told him that it seemed to me that his intention was to show me that there are several parallel realities happening all at the same time and that it is possible for us to consciously move to one of these realities as well as to some other place within our current reality.

He indicated that he was going to leave now as he was satisfied with the answer he had received, since it indicated that I had understood the context of the experience and, therefore, his mission had been accomplished.

He said that I should, one last time, go downstairs to kiss my wife, this time without his interference.

I did so when I realized that I had, in fact, returned to my familiar, current, everyday reality.",12,1737141071.0,Experiencers,4,1.0,False

I had a discussion recently with some friends. One is a Bears fan and the other is a Seahawks fan. The Bears and I were lamenting our franchise's constant cycles of failure and the structural leadership issues that have led to such obvious cycles of bad decisions. 

For the Bears they never sync up their timeline with their football executives and their coaches, nor their coaches and their quarterbacks. They are on a constantly disjointed timeline where one fresh start begins as another seat begins to warm.

The Raiders, as you know, simply have had a slapdash approach to these same types of decisions. Mark Davis interviewed the one GM he _wanted_ originally Reggie McKenzie, Mark Davis _wanted_ Gruden to be the head coach so bad that he fired Jack Del Rio when he probably didn’t quite deserve it yet. Mark Davis _wanted_ McZiegler to bring The Patriots Way to Vegas. I don’t know that Mark Davis _wanted_ AP but I do know he had a lot of emotional pressure from players and fans to make it happen.

We stand at a fork in the road where our path from the Bears could diverge. Standing at the intersection is the plasticly perfect face of Tom fucking Brady, somehow. But first, a bunch of words about the past…

# October 2011

Al Davis dies. A genuinely supersized void is left in one of sports most recognizable organizations. Mark Davis falls into the hole, he can’t really avoid it even if he wants to. Many say he isn’t prepared for it. He’s too player-friendly. He’s not serious. He doesn’t have a killer instinct.

Some of this is easy to say has proven true. Some less so. Either way, this is our line of demarcation (by Markification). This is where we begin to assess Mark Davis as an owner and how his approach to guiding the team changes over time.

First, there is a decision to make on the head coach. Thankfully, Hue Jackson’s end-of-season press conference makes the first part of this decision pretty easy. The guy who traded the farm for Carson Palmer, threw players under the bus, and made a power play for GM power as a 1-year head coach has got to go. Some people accuse Mark of not wanting a strong personality around. Some remember Al abusing Mark verbally in front of Hue and his staff and think Mark is afraid of standing up to them after that. I think Mark just saw the plain-as-day, power-hungry Hue for the snake he was (and proved later to be).

Firing a coaching staff is easy, especially when Hue’s personality was only part of the problem. The Raiders defense in 2011 was one of the worst it had ever fielded. Bresnahan, Biekert, Rod Woodson… they all deserved to be let go (technically their contracts were left to expire). Hue brought in Palmer, who as a veteran QB, opened the door for other offensive coaches to be easy to install.

## Building (always use the first contractor you meet)

Building a football program is hard. Reggie McKenzie was, on paper, a rock-solid hire (whose tenure with the team was probably better than fans in 2018 would want to admit). Reggie was a well-regarded talent evaluator and had been interviewed for multiple other GM roles before being hired by Mark Davis. I say all that only to qualify that this was the first sign of Mark’s unserious process regarding very important football decisions. 

Mark Davis didn’t have a single interview with any other GM candidates. Reggie McKenzie was offered the role after a single six-hour interview. There were other GM candidates floating around out there, including Eric DeCosta, but this all-important first hire was made without even doing due diligence on candidates outside of the one guy Ron Wolf and Ken Herock recommended.

That is bad practice, and we will see it emerge as a pattern in Mark Davis’ hires. Hires that I, as a fan, was often ok with. But at the end of the day the problem with bad practices is you need luck on your side more than if you are conducting everything thoughtfully.

Of course, you can still give credit for making a good hire - which Reggie was. The NFL landscape all nodded along with the hire as a good first move for Mark Davis, most handwaved the lack of process behind it. Many simply applauded that Mark leaned on Ron Wolf, Ken Herock, and John Madden to make the call. Using resources like that was intelligent, but a bigger interview pool is required for a role so important.

I don’t want to linger too hard on what happens in this tenure, I’m sort of overland traveling to hire cycles. 

Dennis Allen gets tapped as Mark/Reggie’s first head coach hire. The team was also in talks with Mike Tice and Marty Mornhinweg. There has been a narrative that the candidate pool was empty because of the cap and roster but the Raiders terminated talks with Tice and Marty - not the other way around. Dennis Allen was “their guy” after just one interview, pretty much. They conducted a second one at the Senior Bowl and then offered him the role - while Allen was at the Senior Bowl coaching with John Fox.

So even though the plan was to conduct a serious search this group still undercut itself by prematurely deciding on a candidate before doing full diligence on the other candidates that they themselves were interested in.

Allen was an up-and-coming defensive mind from a division rival. It is fine if you can rationalize why you want to make a hire in that spirit rather than somebody like Tice or Marty. What you can’t rationalize is handicapping yourself by canceling interviews - even for guys you don’t expect to hire this cycle. What matters in the end is Dennis Allen sucked (and still sucks) at being a head coach. Seems like a nice guy, though. And the Mark Davis machine had operated on emotion and impulse again - rather than a thorough process.

# Gamblin Jack
Mark and Reggie seemed to want to let Allen linger in the job in a pseudo-lame duck year hoping it would convince the NFL community that jobs in Oakland were no longer kept on a short leash. They wanted to show that they would give you a chance at continuity before yanking you off stage because things didn’t go well right away. It was clear Dennis Allen was not leading the team on an upward trajectory but their commitment to giving him more time probably did earn some goodwill among NFL coaches.

Regardless, Allen was fired partway through his third season as head coach. The Raiders were about to write the script for the Bears and Caleb Williams 10 years later (with a much lower-regarded young quarterback in Derek Carr). Carr would already be on to his second offensive coordinator in his second season. He would go on to have three in four seasons, then on to Gruden in his fifth year.

In January 2015, Mark Davis hired the DC away from the Denver Broncos for the 2nd time in as many tries, this time hiring Jack Del Rio. This hiring process was an improvement from the Reggie and Allen cycles - probably because Reggie McKenzie was operating it. The Raiders conducted interviews with seven known candidates (including Del Rio). Del Rio was the only candidate to get a formal second interview. 

* Jack Del Rio, defensive coordinator (Broncos): Hired
* Darrell Bevell, offensive coordinator (Seahawks): Interviewed
* Todd Bowles, defensive coordinator (Cardinals): Declined to interview; hired by Jets
* Pep Hamilton, offensive coordinator (Colts): Interviewed
* Scott Linehan, passing game coordinator (Cowboys): Requested interview
* Eric Mangini, tight ends coach (49ers): Interviewed
* Mike Shanahan, former head coach: Interviewed
* Pat Shurmur, offensive coordinator (Eagles): Interviewed
* Tony Sparano, interim head coach (Raiders): Interviewed

These are undoubtedly higher-quality candidates than the first cycle. A part of this was likely because of the presence of a young QB and a reset cap situation. Bevell, Hamilton, and Bowles were all sought after by other teams. While I believe this process was improved - the end call was still similarly emotional and impulsive. Jack Del Rio had no other head coach interviews - he was part of a staff that was just let go in Denver. Dan Quinn was a much more in-demand defensive coach. Or even Teryl Austin. I think it is fundamentally a bad idea to hire the coordinator from a team whose staff just got fired as your head coach. That might just me be, though.

I will count this search overall as a step in the right direction which demonstrates that a better process does lead to better results but _not exclusively the best results_. Del Rio was a better hire than Dennis Allen, but was he the best hire possible?

# Feeling Nicey

This is where the processes and standards really crumble back down probably below their initial level with Mark Davis. Mark’s need to hire Gruden was purely personal and emotional. Jack Del Rio had run a disappointing team in 2017 but there were pieces in place to build from. Of course, it was a difficult year politically and Jack seems to have been a bit tone-deaf with his players. He was guiding a team with an all-black OL as an anti-kneeler. So I think there is reason to consider that Del Rio’s personal politics played a role in Mark being so willing to move on after a not-great not-catastrophic season. Added to this is the decision to elevate Todd Downing to OC and replace Musgrave - which had genuinely terrible results.

But the point here really is that more than ever, Mark Davis was leading this team by his personal whim and emotions rather than a deeply serious process.

As an aside, this is a thing that Mark has really mostly exhibited with _football_ decisions. Mark navigated the move to Vegas pretty masterfully after all. His ownership of the Aces has gone tremendously. He has a weak spot for football - and I think it comes down to his more emotional investment in it paired with his lack of deep knowledge.

# We’re TV Guys, of Course We Run a Team

Gruden operated as, not in a good way, an extension of Mark’s emotional (say “instinctual” if you want to try to slap lipstick on the pig) way of running the football operation. Gruden came in with Reggie, who was already in place. Gruden was much more used to an upside-down HC/GM relationship with Bruce Allen, so the moves were made to bring in Mike Mayock.

The team did only enough to satisfy the Rooney Rule, but there was no genuine search for a GM candidate. Gruden wanted Mayock.

Mayock’s tenure as GM saw an absolutely astonishing waste of premium draft resources and some big-time failed free-agency moves. It was a personnel disaster (that had some silver linings in late picks).

Bad process leads to bad… say it with me… results.

# McZiegler

The funny thing about this hiring pair is that I think this was Mark’s significant effort to disconnect from what he thought was the flawed process. He was so enamored with the Patriots' success (and blind to all previous attempts to duplicate it) that he saw McDaniels and Ziegler as this high-power duo that would come in synced up and be able to elevate the franchise with a united football vision and slick suits.

The problem with the approach here - he had made his mind up again before the interview processes even began. Mark Davis went into the search to replace Gruden and Mayock with his mind made up that he wanted to pursue a specific candidate.

This is where this whole fucking ramble links back up to the Viking friend I mentioned originally. This is the same cycle that the Vikings hired Kevin O’Connell and Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. So we were talking one day and it came to mind for me to compare candidates between the Raiders, Bears, and Vikings because they all made hires in this same offseason.

The Vikings pursued high-quality candidates for both roles. Even the Bears cast a wide net with an open mind (and terrible timing with their quarterback).

I don’t know if this sticks out to you but to me, it looks an awful lot like we made some external minority interviews to satisfy the Rooney Rule and gave Bisaccia a token interview, too. Mark went into the process with a preference again. He got what he wanted but not what he desired.

McDaniels was an obvious disaster and despite being brought in as a package deal - there was a clear disconnect between Ziegler’s roster choices and Mcdaniels' coaching decisions. The pair didn’t pull in the same direction and McDaniels didn’t operate with really any professional nuance or consideration for the future.

# Black Air Force Ones

Fast-forward again. McZiegler get canned - rightfully so (moreso for McDaniels). Antonio Pierce assumes the role as interim head coach. Mark Davis hires him as full-time head coach _before_ he hires a general manager. AP is in on GM interviews while only being interim in title. This is another spin around this merry-go-round where not even minor due diligence is done because the process was entered with a preference for the hire.

Bad process…

The GM process was marginally better. 2 points for that. -100 points for having your interim head coach in the GM interviews. Telesco was chosen from a hat of familiar names. Trey Brown, Ed Dodds, and Champ Kelly along with some new faces like Terrance Gray, Adam Peters, Telesco, and Kelly Kleine Van Calligan. Most of these names were buzzing around the league, Peters was hired as WAS GM. Kelly was retained as asst. GM. Better process but produced out of another flawed process with a fundamental rationale that simply hampered the best chance of continuity (hiring Champ). Mark didn’t want a first-time head coach with a first-time GM so he hired Telesco instead of Kelly.

AP and Telesco were both fired. AP deserved it more but I believe the fundamental reasoning behind firing Telesco is sound (on top of the fact he was never a good hire in the first place). 

# The Dawning of a New Era?

Now if you read all that it would be very fair for you to say “Mark Davis is a fundamental problem in this process.” That is totally valid. I’ve always held he _means well_ and isn’t meddlesome but his hiring approaches have _always_ been hampered by bad processes. Even when he conducts a better process (like the only real coach search Reggie got to overlook) the results are still undercut by emotions/instincts that have often proven harmful.

This is where the “sell the team” sentiment has come from for the last couple of years. Not a personal dislike of Davis but of fundamental problems with how he operates the football team. Mark, in his own accidentally iconic fashion, responded to these calls with the gut-wrenching turn to Tom Brady. Tom fucking Brady is part owner of the Raiders. But what is more critical moving forward - Tom Brady looks like he is the guy Mark has always wanted. A football guy who will take the wheel and drive this bitch because Mark finally let go of the wheel.

Mark has talked about a role like this for a while. A “president of football operations” or something that works with him but above the GM and head coach. This is a difficult position to fill and carries much risk if you get the hire wrong (so you could understand Mark’s delay in filling it). This is part of the potential for success with Tom Brady being part-owner and assuming this role. With Tom Brady’s voice becoming this type of authority for the entire football operation there is much less risk of short-term job-saving moves that a hired person might pursue. At all levels of the team, the people involved are trying their best to win, but there is a secondary motivation to retain their jobs or get promoted. That secondary instinct can lead to moves that don’t align with the long-term vision of the franchise - rather they prioritize a specific iteration of the _team_.

So, to me, I’m at a point where the Tom Brady leadership role is a welcome experiment. We know that Mark has a fundamentally flawed approach to important hires. He has often made decisions based on emotion and loyalty rather than thorough processes and research.

Tom Brady is unlikely to do so. Even as a player, he was notoriously unfriendly. He isn’t here to make friends in the board room. He has an opportunity to guide a franchise in his own vision and an owner who finally seems ready to take a smaller role.

That is the real thing happening here. Not a Brady power play or cunning. Not the Raiders being dysfunctional and not knowing what to do. They are finally approaching the football operation with a direction. Thus, the clean slate. Thus the ability to even interview Ben Johnson and all of the other highest tier coaches in this cycle. The Raiders are, hopefully, turning a corner where vital decisions don’t hinge on a single long interview, emotional pleas from players/fans, or interim coaches involved in GM searches (like Hue wanted to be).

What this shift represents is a modernization of the Raiders football operation. A brave step by Davis and something he deserves some credit for - even if some recognized the need for it many years ago. I guarantee that the Raiders mean more to Mark Davis than they do to any of us. He grew up in the locker room. He ate with the coaches and players. He is a Raider. He isn’t the football man his dad was, but he’s loosening his grip on this precious thing to hopefully see it finally blossom. I think that is kind of cool.

I put it this way in a comment about Ben Johnson and Tom Brady yesterday:

> So what Tom Brady sells to Ben Johnson or anybody else isn't just ""hey I'm Tom Brady, maybe I'll see you in the break room sometimes"" but something a lot bigger. He is selling his vision for how the Raiders football operation is going to be built in this new era. The resources are available (Mark isn't poor and recent sales to other ownership interests have boosted liquidity overall by a lot). The commitment to the vision is in place.
> He's being offered a clean slate with influence over the GM hire, an overarching vision constructed by Tom Brady (who is part owner, so it isn't like the rug will get pulled out from under him if Mark Davis were to fire Brady or Brady resigned from a titled role), and undoubtedly a massive bag of money and a long-term contract.",29,1737140884.0,raiders,16,0.9,False

I’m so tired, and I’d love to get myself a little cup of coffee. But then the internal debate starts: 
- Should I buy a coffee? I just bought a slice of pizza and a drink at the grocery store a couple days ago. We’re trying to eat out less. I should have made a coffee at home but I was too distracted. 
- I forgot my reusable cup so now I’ll have to get a single use plastic cup. Maybe I shouldn’t. 
- I’m cold so I want a hot drink but those hot drink cups at coated in plastic and are so bad for you.
- If I keep spending $10 here and there at the cafe every week we’ll never save enough for new windows at our house.
- The kids fell asleep in the back seat. There is a Starbucks drive-thru right next to me, but I want to support small business, so I need to travel further to one of the few local cafes around and wake the kids up to get them out so I can go into the store. 
- Is it worse to drive further for local or drive less for corporate?
- But isn’t it a good thing to spend $4 to support a local vegan cafe; since several other vegan restaurants recently closed?
- Maybe I’ll just drink from my kids water bottle

Now this isn’t something I’m agonizing over but these are the actual thoughts that flash through my head before I make a decision on whether or not to get coffee. As I was thinking about it, I scrolled past the news story that’s circulating about the Kardashians using up over 330,000 gallons of water in a single month.

As the world continues to embrace the digital economy, the United States must remain at the forefront of financial and technological innovation. One key area where the nation can assert leadership is by establishing strategic crypto reserves. Similar to gold and silver reserves, these digital assets can serve as a backbone for economic stability and resilience in an increasingly decentralized financial landscape. Among the myriad of cryptocurrencies available, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and DigiByte stand out as essential candidates for inclusion in such reserves due to their unique technical merits, proven reliability, and specialized use cases.

# Bitcoin: The Digital Gold

Bitcoin (BTC), often referred to as “digital gold,” is the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. Its inclusion in a strategic reserve is justified by the following characteristics:

1. **Security and Decentralization**: Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, supported by the largest and most distributed network of miners, ensures unparalleled security and resistance to censorship. With over a decade of flawless operation, Bitcoin has proven its robustness against attacks.
2. **Limited Supply**: With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity mirrors that of gold, making it an ideal store of value. This inherent scarcity ensures long-term value appreciation and hedges against inflation.
3. **Global Recognition**: Bitcoin’s universal acceptance as a digital asset ensures its liquidity and utility as a reserve asset. It’s widely used as a hedge against fiat currency instability, reinforcing its role as a strategic asset.
4. **Infrastructure and Adoption**: Bitcoin boasts the most extensive and mature ecosystem, from wallets and exchanges to payment processors. This infrastructure makes it a reliable and accessible reserve asset.

# Litecoin: The Digital Silver

Litecoin (LTC) is often compared to silver in the context of digital assets. Created as a “lighter” alternative to Bitcoin, it complements Bitcoin’s role as digital gold in several key ways:

1. **Faster Transactions**: Litecoin’s block generation time of approximately 2.5 minutes is four times faster than Bitcoin’s, making it more efficient for smaller transactions and quicker settlements.
2. **Lower Fees**: Litecoin’s network offers significantly lower transaction fees, making it an attractive option for everyday payments and cross-border transactions.
3. **Robust Security**: While leveraging a similar proof-of-work mechanism as Bitcoin, Litecoin utilizes the Scrypt hashing algorithm, providing an additional layer of diversity in the reserve’s technical foundations.
4. **Proven Longevity**: Launched in 2011, Litecoin has stood the test of time, maintaining its reputation as a reliable and secure cryptocurrency.
5. **Maximum Supply**: Litecoin has a capped supply of 84 million coins—exactly four times that of Bitcoin—ensuring scarcity while allowing for a broader distribution and utility.

# DigiByte: Everyday Utility and Speed

DigiByte (DGB) is a lesser-known but highly innovative cryptocurrency that excels in everyday utility and technological advancements. Including DigiByte in a strategic reserve provides the following advantages:

1. **Unparalleled Speed**: DigiByte’s block time of just 15 seconds makes it one of the fastest UTXO-based blockchains, enabling near-instant transaction confirmations. For example, you could buy a soda with DigiByte in a matter of seconds, whereas Bitcoin or Litecoin might take several minutes due to their longer block times.
2. **Scalability**: Thanks to its SegWit integration and advanced blockchain design, DigiByte can handle over 1,000 transactions per second, far surpassing Bitcoin and Litecoin.
3. **Security through Diversity**: DigiByte employs five distinct mining algorithms, significantly enhancing its network security and decentralization. This innovation reduces the risk of a single point of failure or dominance by specialized mining hardware.
4. **Maximum Supply**: DigiByte has a total supply of 21 billion coins, making it highly accessible for everyday transactions while maintaining its decentralized nature.
5. **DigiAssets**: DigiByte supports the creation of DigiAssets, a feature that allows users to create, trade, and manage digital assets such as tokens, smart contracts, and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This positions DigiByte as a blockchain capable of supporting a wide variety of applications beyond simple payments.
6. **DApps and Practical Utility**: DigiByte’s blockchain can host decentralized applications (DApps), making it a versatile platform for developers. Its rapid transaction speeds and low fees make it particularly suitable for real-world applications, such as retail payments and micropayments.
7. **Global Accessibility**: DigiByte’s low fees and rapid transaction speeds make it ideal for microtransactions and everyday use, positioning it as a digital currency for the masses.
8. **Grassroots Growth**: With a strong and passionate community, DigiByte has demonstrated organic growth and resilience, proving its long-term viability.

# Strategic Value of UTXO-Based Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin, Litecoin, and DigiByte share a common foundation as UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)-based cryptocurrencies. This technical design ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in transaction validation. The UTXO model offers:

1. **Auditability**: Every transaction can be traced back to its origin, ensuring an immutable and transparent ledger.
2. **Efficiency**: The UTXO model simplifies transaction verification, reducing computational overhead and enhancing scalability.
3. **Security**: By using discrete transaction outputs, the UTXO model minimizes the risk of double-spending and other vulnerabilities.

# Complementary Roles in a Strategic Reserve

1. **Bitcoin as Digital Gold**: A cornerstone of the reserve, Bitcoin provides unmatched security, liquidity, and a hedge against economic uncertainties.
2. **Litecoin as Digital Silver**: Complementing Bitcoin, Litecoin offers faster and cheaper transactions, serving as a versatile medium of exchange while supporting DApps and Ordinals.
3. **DigiByte for Everyday Transactions**: With its speed, scalability, and support for DigiAssets and DApps, DigiByte bridges the gap between store of value and practical utility, enabling seamless day-to-day transactions, such as buying a soda in seconds.

# Conclusion

Incorporating Bitcoin, Litecoin, and DigiByte into the United States’ strategic crypto reserves is a forward-thinking move that leverages the unique strengths of each cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s role as digital gold, Litecoin’s utility as digital silver, and DigiByte’s capacity for high-speed, everyday transactions create a well-rounded reserve that can enhance economic resilience and promote financial innovation. As the digital age unfolds, these assets provide the foundation for a robust and adaptive monetary strategy.

We’re a family of 6 (4 adults and 2 kids) visiting Singapore for the first time. We’ll be staying near Robertson Quay, with breakfast and pick/drop included for most days, though we might use public transport once or twice for unplanned roaming. Would love some advice and recommendations on a few things:

1. Cash vs. Forex Card
- What percentage of currency should we keep in cash versus forex?

2. SIM Cards
- Has anyone used Singtel’s combo SIM that includes EZ-Link? Is it worth it, or do you recommend something else?

3. Vegetarian Food Options
- What vegetarian dishes should we try out in Singapore? Any must-visit vegetarian or vegan restaurants?
- We’re also big fans of coffee, desserts, and drinks—would love to explore Singapore’s café scene or unique local options!

4. Chinese New Year (29th Jan)
- Since this day is free for us, where would you suggest visiting to experience the celebrations or soak in the local vibe?
- Also, any recommendations for local shopping or souvenirs?

5. Buying Apple Gadgets
- I’m planning to buy some Apple gadgets during this trip. Is it better to pay in cash to avoid card charges, or will something like BookMyForex or a credit card work just as well?
- Any specific stores you’d recommend for Apple products?

6. Universal Studios Visit
- We’re planning to visit Universal Studios on a weekday. Should we spend extra on upgrading to the express pass, or will normal tickets suffice?

7. SEA Aquarium and Tight Schedule
- How long does it take to fully explore the SEA Aquarium?
- We’re wondering if we can include it on the same day as our current schedule, which includes Madame Tussauds, SkyHelix, and the Wings of Time show starting at 7:40 PM.

After reading so many relatable posts in the Reddit. I am 27 years old. And I’ve been dealing with endo and autoimmune shit for most of my adult life. I just thought I had frequent UTIs, (currently have one now) but that paired with having UTI symptoms when I go to the doctor but then them testing and it coming out negative. They’ve told me maybe I just have some bladder irritation. But when the pain gets really bad I always accociated it with my bad cramps. I have endometriosis, and I thought it was endo/flare cramps/pain. It took me years of this paired with other symptoms (frequent urge to urinate) to realize it was my bladder that was actually having the issues. 

But now I’ve been stuck between a rock and a hard place for awhile, because I don’t have insurance. All of my chronic illness issues combined have made holding a job extremely hard for me (not to mention just the mental hoops) and I don’t really go to the doctor anymore because I literally can’t afford to. I’m a frequent flyer at my local urgent care and I’m sure they hate to see me coming.

I know grammar and spelling aren't the best ways to judge someone, but it's all I got, and this one was tough to read. Maybe it's just me?

# 37, M4F #BayArea, A Limbido that Can't Be Silenced

>I have a driven, healthy worklife, two kids that are my other half. I love talking movies, music, books, pop culture and theories.

>Curiosity and time has taught me that I wish to explore non traditional relationships with non traditional partners.

>What I am looking for: A thoughtful, open partner who is equally curious and wishes for a discreet, sexual, fwb relationship.

>I still want to connect on a emotional level with you but, you will find I'm trustworthy and easy to love.

>I hope we talk soon.

I'm only including this because ""limbido"" would be a fun word. Limbido: the Forbidden Dance!

# 46 [M4F] #NJ Need a spy partner to track down maple syrup mafia

>I'm a secret spy that is tracking down the maple syrup mafia. For too long they have held pancakes & waffles hostage. To deal with this sticky & sweet situation I'm looking for a partner.

>Be good with communication & on top of your OPSEC. Be in NJ and able to meet in person. Can be a fan of pancakes or waffles or even maple cookies. Looking for a spy that can be exclusive and something long-term.

>My current syrup disguise has me as a married businessman that is 6', 190 lbs living in New Jersey. I have a flexible schedule and ready to handle exciting toe curling missions but can't do overnight stakeouts. If we succeed in this, we can move onto bigger things like tracking down the secret NJ vacation home of the Loch Ness monster or finding out why there are so many ghostings in this subreddit ;).

I've seen this one a couple of times and usually pass it by, but...is there something I'm missing, or is it just humor that's not hitting me (which is fine, especially since I'm not the target audience, anyway).

>Currently wanting to change the pace of what my marriage has been doing. Which is beating me upside the head. My wife has had multiple APs, I was furious. After calming down I offered her;

>Clean divorce - she gets to keep everything, and I keep my mouth shut about her indiscretion.

>Open marriage - she's free to have boy toys with no problems from me.

>Stay together exclusively.

# 35 [M4F] #LosAngeles, CA - I like butts and I cannot lie

>I hope everyone is safe with the fires. Talk about a surreal time we live in.

>Anywho…Yes…a corny intro to my kink: anal only. However I’m fine with oral only as well. It’s just my thing as of late for some reason, and I'm looking to meet an awesome woman (note woman) to have some fun in-person with both in and maybe out of the bedroom. I’m married and if you’re sorely desiring to share genuine affection and fun times with someone to fill that void as an AP or FWB, I’m your guy.

>I love performing foreplay on my partner, exploring and appreciating her body, arousing her in many ways, making her squirm, and giving her a massive release. Oral is awesome - giving and receiving. Performing oral on a woman is more than just tracing your ABCs, it's a delicate art that I embrace and enjoy. 69? You betcha - nothing like spreading her from behind and making her squirm. I am experienced at anal, so I’m happy to help if guidance is needed.

>I may be over 6’ (so I walk like a question mark in airplanes) with brown hair and blue eyes, but I like both tall and short women alike. Are you short where I’ll pick you up and carry you away? Or are you tall where we’ll do nonstop height checks? I'm a total switch, so I'm compatible with many - from my pinning you down taking total control, to you hopping on having your way with me, to us having a mutual wrestling match back and forth. I get a kick out of brattiness, sass, and sarcasm. It that describes you…I got my eye on you. Also, cuddling is the best aftercare. I'm pretty open minded, so if there's a kink you want to explore, let's discuss it.

>I argue the key part of FWBs is the F part. Thus I do value a degree of connection, even if it's friendly. Attraction to me is not just the physical, but also the intellectual and emotional (did I mention I'm a huge sapiosexual?). I’m an old school nerd in a way (along the lines of languages, technology, history, reading, solving the hard problems - like figuring out how much wood could a woodchuck chuck).

>I enjoy working out in the gym, spinning, hiking, and going for a run - making me the strongest dad bod in the whole LA Region. Want to work out with me, cook with me, watch a movie with me, listen to music with me, hike with me? I'm down - those are my pastimes.

>I want this to be in-person and regular. I am a busy guy but I can easily make time early mornings before work, and perhaps take a day off of work later in the week.

>What do you think? Let's see how well we click- I'll do my part, and I expect you to do the same. You up for some fun?

And now, for my next performance, foreplay!

# 46 [M4F] #EastCoast - would you(f) take a job with extra pay to be secretly *available* to your (m)boss?

>I know it's a common fantasy. But I mean in the real world.

>Would you actually take a new job where you would make yourself available to your male boss anytime for anything he desires? (within hard limits)

>A few logistical notes: —Almost entirely during work hours, with occasional exception for an evening event or work trip. But it wouldn't dominate the rest of your life. —No one else would know. Secret within the company and secret from private lives. Your coworkers, friends, husband, etc. would never know. —Assume the boss is white man mid 40s, tall, in pretty good shape and pretty good looking.

>I can imagine a variety of reasons why it would be appealing: maybe you just love sex; maybe in particular you find the power dynamic intoxicating; maybe you want or need the money.

>Or maybe you’re in a dead bedroom and this is the perfect way to scratch your itch without suspicion…

>Regardless, step outside the Reddit throwaway context and ask yourself whether you would actually consider it.

>If you would, send me a DM.

So...is WFH available for this position?

# 68(M4F) NYC/Long Island - Retired professional white male seeks to meet a professional woman whether a Doctor, Attorney, Corporate Executive, CPA, Business Owner, Teacher, College professor etc., who 's been neglected in the bedroom and desires to meet a much older man every now and then

>to take care of her bedroom needs. Whether you live in the NY area or travel here on business your sex life is virtually non existent. Whether married, dating or single, your sex life is not what you want and you need to take care of this normal human itich. You want someone older because you do not want to play games and just want to have fun in bed with a man who knows what he is doing. While I am older I look young for my age, 6', 200, dad body, clean shaven, have no ED issues, am well educated, non smoker, do not drink, and am very unselfish sexually. Whether you crave hours of oral pleasure, kinky fun etc., sexually I am wide open, but totally respect limits. ED is not in my vocabulary. My cock is very very thick, cut mushroom head, groomed and I truly last a long time. Plus I possess first class oral skills. While I am on Long Island I can travel into Manhattan and Queens, We will go at your pace and it will be up to you to ask me if or when you are ready to potentially meet whether for coffee or just going for it.

Obviously we can't go a week without hearing from This Guy.

# 42 [M4F] Texas/Online If a girl half my age whispered in my ear that she could keep a secret, I’d be hers

>I’m honestly so pent up. I’ve been daydreaming about a girl I barely know, or maybe one who I shouldn’t be with like one of my students seeing the need in my eyes when I look at her body, and telling me that she can keep a secret.

>That’s all I need to know. That whatever I do with her, it stays between us. I could drop the facade of being an older, authoritative man who’s always in charge. Who has all his needs met. In that moment her words would break me, and I’d immediately be hers.

# 39 [M4F] #SoCal - And now a word from my penis…

>It has been brought to my attention that my personality isn’t going to cut it anymore, neither will my rugged good looks, therefore I will have to hand the reigns over to my penis effectively cutting out the middleman.

>My penis, formerly Doctor Dong, Dickasaurus Rex, and captain Winky, would like to be called “Nick Popadopolus” going forward.

>Nick is a champion figure skater. Nick has visited 5 continents and is fluent in 13 languages including Esperanto and American Sign Language. Nick is independently wealthy from his line of fashion turtle necks and tiny hats sold worldwide. Nick is currently writing a future best seller in his memoirs “I penis” but he would like to let his fans know it’s going to take George R.R. Martin levels of time because he types slow.

>Nick isn’t looking forward to spending the long holiday weekend alone. Ideally there’s someone out there who wants to hold him and spin around on the beach and skip through a field before having a romantic lunch in the park. Nick promises he wants to get to know you and have in depth conversations about love and John Mayer songs and he is not like every other penis out there who just wants to see you nude. *wink*

>Say hi, Nick would love to hear from you!

I have a nagging suspicion that this isn't *really* his penis talking.

>I love dates, activities, kissing, connecting— imagine this— actually becoming real life friends. Not just looking for a casual thing…unless???

>I feel good about my conversation skillz and am easy-going, open-minded and various other hyphenated positive characteristics. I definitely have some really good stories; I’ve had a pretty interesting life. But I wanna know all about you; I’ve been told I’m a good active listener…

>Come say hi…

>INTERESTS: art in every form, horror movies, hip-hop, DJing, live music, tattoos, fashion, vintage shopping, the Mets, stand-up comedy, death metal, pop punk, gym/lifting, cooking, vinyl records, playing guitar and piano, reading both fiction and non-, graphic novels, animation, true crime and documentary, midnight movies, making fun of bad movies, Italy, coffee, dogs, whatever cool thing you're going to introduce me to...

This one confuses me - if he's ""partnered ENM"", why is he trawling through r/affairs? Nope, not suspicious at all.

I ordered a drink that on the menu was between 5.15 (smallest) and 5.35 (largest), but I was charged 6.00. I didn't ask for anything like extra syrup or a substitute type of milk, either. 

I've also noticed that prices differ by branch too. I would have inquired about it but the barista already had a face like a slapped ass the whole time.

So I have family in Japan and have been traveling to Tokyo about once a year for the past several years, but this was the first trip since I started my coffee hobby and fell into the rabbit hole of speciality coffee earlier this year.  

With such a good exchange ($1 USD \~ 158 yen) rate and lots of time to kill, figured it was a good opportunity to do a circuit of the Roastful 2024 Top 100 roasters around Tokyo, so I hit up Apollon’s Gold (Kudanshita), Onibus (Naka-meguro), Fuglen (Asakusa), Glitch (Takebashi/Jimbocho), and Leaves (Ryogoku). Also checked out Koffee Mameya (Omote-sando) and picked up bags there from Code Black, Homeground, and Common Grounds. So grabbing beans from 7 of the top 100 in one trip/same city, is pretty cool. Also checked out a few other roasters, not on the Roastful list including Sedai in Shibuya, Aaliya Coffee Roasters in Shinjuku, and Tasse Coffee Roastery in Takadanobaba. Ended up coming home with nearly 6 pounds of beans!

I also picked up a few cheap Hario servers and some new Origami Air drippers and of course super cheap filter papers from Tokyu Hands, and some nice Kihara cups from Loft. 

As far as experience at each place went:

**Aaliya Coffee Roasters (Shinjuku):** Stumbled into this place. Small but decent selection, served in fancy Avensi coffee tasting glassware. French toast was really good and better than the coffee. Think they are more popular for their french toast, but did have some nice uncommon beans from regions like Burundi and Peru. 

**Apollon’s Gold:** Visited twice. First time we were only customers there, had a Costa Rica Yellow Honey Yellow Typica as espresso, and their Pepe Jijon wave washed geisha as a pour over. It was my wife’s first experience drinking black coffee and said it was an eye-opening experience! Bought both of these beans, and 3^(rd) bag of a Pacamara Natural from Nicaragua. 

2^(nd) visit there were a few more customers in and out, but I stuck around since they just added a new couch (new since my first visit the week before) and had a fun chat with their barista Joseph (super cool guy). Also tried their Costa Rica white honey SL28. 

Brew Guide: [https://ja.apollons-gold.com/pages/brew-guides](https://ja.apollons-gold.com/pages/brew-guides) (They do brew with Nucleus Paragon in the shop)

**Glitch (Takebashi):** 2 visits here. My wife came with me on the first visit and got seats right at the bar (think it was a Thursday around 2 pm). Both of us did a 3 coffee flight but I would NOT recommend the flight since you only get half the brew of each so not worth the 200 yen discount. She did the Colombian Geisha Antimaceration (bought beans), Colombian Castillo Double Anaerobic Washed, and China Dehong Catimor P4 Yest Fermentation Honey. I did the Guatemala COE #3 washed Geisha, the Colombian Risaralda Milan Caturra Nitro Washed (bought beans), and the Colombian Java Fermented Natural (bought beans). Also did a Costa Rica Esperanza Hybrid Natural Anaerobic as a latte. They were roasting while we were there for this visit. They also brew with Nucleus Paragon but chill over the entire brew). Most staff proficient in English (as most customers were foreigners), but place is too busy to really chat them up or ask more than a few quick questions.

2^(nd) visit by myself, on a Wednesday around noon, got a seat at the bar again but much busier than the week before, and I just beat a group of 10 that walked in about 10 minutes after I ordered. Had the Honduras 2024 COE #2 as pour-over and their Ethiopia Sidama natural as espresso. Between the two visits, tried about 60% of the beans they had in rotation. The Colombians were my favorite and had the most intense flavors and some of the favorites the whole trip. Would rate just on bean/quality coffee as my #1 overall (tied with Leaves).

**Onibus (Naka-meguro):** Cool and very chill shop. Got there pretty early after opening, maybe 2 other people there, had 2 pour-overs and bought 3 bags, Kenya AA, Guatamala, and Honduras, all washed. Their banana bread with espresso butter is really good. Most seating is outside and there is a quiant little enclosed 2^(nd) story loft literally right next to the train tracks which is pictureequse.

**Fuglen (Asakusa):** Right next to Senso-ji Temple. Had one pour-over of an Ethiopia Wholisho/Dega washed coffee that was really interesting (bought beans) and a cappucinno which my wife really enjoyed. Super creamy and silky smooth. Super busy, and just barely found a seat. Also had their Norwegian waffle which was pretty good. Interested to check out their Sangubashi/Yoyogi location next time. Biggest and busiest café on the list by far and widest food selection (as most don’t have any food), but right in heart of tourist area so too busy and bustling for maximum enjoyment. 

**Leaves:** \#1 ranked Japanese roaster in Roastful’s Top 100 and #18 in the world. Visited on a Monday afternoon a few hours before closing. Was pretty busy but did get 2 seats on the window sill. Had their temperature change espresso/latte set (Ethiopia Sky Project Bloom) and then did their comparative Panama Finca Nuguo geisha set (natural & washed). Picked up another Pepe Jijon wave washed geisha (will be interesting to compare to AG’s roast), Colombia Pink Bourbon Anaerobic Natural, and an Ethiopia Natural Hamasho. Liked all the natural options. Brewing on the CT-62 dripper and known for their meticulous prep, including leveling drippers. Overall vibe though was a bit too laboratory and clinical, not super comfortable to hang out.  They did have an X-Bloom on a coffee cart outside in the street for ""to-go"" orders. Tied for my #1 bean/cup with Glitch.

**Koffee Mameya (Omote-sando):** This was the first and only place there was a line to wait (although only had to wait about 10 minutes). Cool and unique experience of coffee “consultation” and conceirge-type service. Think I ended up drinking like 4 or 5 coffees here. All staff pretty fluent in English and super knowledable and I spent probably 90 minutes here and was able to chat with the staff and a few fellow customers. Other customers were a mix of coffee geeks and nerds, and some tourists. Picked up 3 bags from Code Black, Homeground, and Common Grounds. Also bought the dripper they use, the SD-1. Probably the overall most fun experience in total, taking in both coffee quality, atmosphere, and ability to really engage and converse with the baristas. 

**Sedai (Shibuya):** Discovered this place on another recent Japan bean haul post here last week. Bought some Thai Anaerobic naturals here and had a good conversation with the barista after some of the take-out customer left. Even got some free “secret” beans from some of their experimental/sample roasts, which was really cool.

**Tasse (Takadanobaba):** This was a last minute conincidental find, and ironically, in the same area of town where my family lives and we literally walk past it every day! It’s amazing the places in Tokyo you walk may and never notice. Only went here the day before coming home so didn’t buy beans here yet or get to spend a lot of time. Shop was empty when we went in so hopefully they’re still around next trip around so I can spend more time there and make it my “regular” coffee shop. One of the few that did have affogato on the menu so had to get that, and it was really good. Will get beans next time. 

Next trip hoping to get to some of the other top roasters outside of Tokyo, in Kyoto and Osaka like Kurasu, Weekenders, and Lilo if possible. Only big place I think I missed out on around Tokyo was Philocoffea, Tetsu Kasuya’s shop in Funabashi. 

Would love to hear your thoughts and other recommendations for Tokyo coffee. Next trip will get here probably soon after I run out of beans!",5,1737139917.0,pourover,1,0.78,False

1i3nn1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1i3nn1m/the_2010s_were_the_years_when_being_vegan_was/,"The 2010s Were the Years When Being Vegan Was Cool, the 2020s Are the Years When the Carnivore Diet Is the Hot Thing.","
This is just an observation I made while looking at current trends, both online and in real life.

Sure, not many people were vegan in 2014 (just a random year), but I remember a much more positive attitude toward plant-based eating and the people who followed it. Lifestyle influencers were all about eating less meat and dairy—using almond milk was considered cool. There was also a noticeable shift in trendsetters. While the 2010s were dominated by women influencing diet trends and the public’s approach to nutrition, the 2020s seem to belong to big, muscular men promoting diets that supposedly boost testosterone and make you feel “alive.”

The 2020s have become the decade of meat and dairy. Drinking raw milk is now seen as edgy and cool, while raw meat is treated as the holy grail of nutrition. Those same lifestyle influencers who once promoted plant-based alternatives now claim to feel “so much better” using whole cow’s milk in their coffee. Saturated fats are no longer viewed as intimidating.

I think this shift is linked to the new wave of conservatism that surged after Covid. Let me explain: masculinity is a core value in conservatism, but masculinity doesn’t really mean anything on its own. It’s often defined as the opposite of femininity. This is why men tend to avoid anything associated with femininity. For example, in clothing, women have more freedom to explore their style—no one makes a big deal about a girl wearing a shirt or hoodie. Meanwhile, a boy wearing a skirt often sparks outrage.

With this renewed emphasis on traditional masculinity, the obsession with meat and dairy feels almost predictable. Meat symbolizes hunting, toughness, strength, and protein for building muscle—all things seen as inherently “masculine.” In contrast, veganism is often associated with gentleness, empathy, and soy (linked to estrogen), which are traits culturally viewed as more “feminine.” That’s why being a carnist, in my opinion, is tightly linked to the patriarchy and fragile masculinity.

Just my two cents

I am 37 yo, I work in an IT company in Europe. When I go to the office I usually have my seat in an open space that hosts many different teams. In another team there is this girl I really am interested in, and I would like to get to know her.

The problem is I am shy and reserved as a person, as a matter of fact I had just 4 women in all my life.

I know her name because I asked a colleague of mine in my team to send me the emails containing the scheduling of the seats: we have a booking system but I lost all the emails, and I looked for some particular name (she’s chinese). This colleague is one of a kind and has a lot of good words for me, we also talk on whatsapp out of work sometimes, but I don’t trust him fully. That’s because on one side he says things like “I’ve no fear of anything if you support me, you’re a genius, I love you” and so on, but on the other hand these could be manipulatory behaviors.

So I was thinking to ask him, because he’s the only point of reference in there, to help me to know this girl by letting him introduce her to me (he should introduce himself first to her) but my mind is running at high speed with a lot of doubts and fears. What if she’s engaged, what if she is embarrassed from me, what if it’s not the right way to do it.

Also I don’t know if it’s actually correct to hit on her if we work in the same company.

Talking about the girl, I’ve met her on Wednesday next to the elevator, we were alone but she looked down to the floor when she saw me. Then I’ve met her again coming back from the coffee room to my seat, she saw me, and walked to the coffee room again. But I made a big mistake, we were alone into the coffee room and and I didn’t have the guts to speak. I’m paralyzed by her beauty. I'm feeling like a 15yo again.

Please give some advice on this, what’s the right thing to do, thanks in advance.",2,1737139624.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

I’m here after the PMDD sub, I tried to find some support as my wife I am convinced has PMDD.  They pointed me here.

Glad to join and at last - to have some other folks who know what it’s like for us!

This was a bad month.  My wife isn’t diagnosed, but you tell me:

- Usually very nice and supportive.
- for 1.5 weeks tied in with cycle behavior changes dramatically.
- Outright insults at times to me and my family, and says very hurtful things.
- Near constant criticism and complaining.  Non stop.
- At times it has escalated to mild physical abuse, I got hit in anger for one coffee cup left out a year ago.  Had to take my daughter out the house to get away from it. 
- Irresponsible spending tied to this time. Sometimes thousands. 
-  Plans made to emigrate/move.  Quitting jobs. 
- lethargy and sleeping a lot.  

Sometimes if it’s verbal abuse I have to go book a hotel. 

I’ve had many relationships but I’ve never ever experienced this.  

If she’s on the pill these symptoms virtually disappear.  The progesterone pill she is brilliant.  The combined, she is even worse than menstrual cycle and I can’t even describe the rage, it is EPIC the 2 times she tried combined pill. 

Other than that she’s a loving partner.

Looking for songs like above to play in a lounge setting that is good for head-nodding, smoking, socializing. Nothing overpowering but still enough energy you could get up and move if you wanted to, but not mosh.

This [Pierce remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIyUfIWsmXM&pp=ygURcGllcmNlIGRheSBuIG5pdGU%3D) is a 100% dead on perfect example of what I'm looking for, groovy, not aggressive enough to distract a room or cause headbanging, but not entirely lowkey either, you can feel the energy and its more than just ""background music.""

  
Very similar mentions are [Sweet Memories by Zed's Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5xCKYMfpEc) (another 100% match) and this [HEYZ remix of Lose Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltbJ6PJQJNg). HEYZ remix is a great example because the dubstep is ALMOST a bit too aggressive on the wubs and sound design but the vocals are so forward and beautiful that the overall song is still very pleasant and simple enough to have in a social setting. Tons of songs by Break Science are other good examples of what I'm looking for, in particular [""Once In A While](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iypesodZF3E&pp=ygUcYnJlYWsgc2NpZW5jZSBvbmNlIGluIGF3aGlsZQ%3D%3D)"" and ""[Light Speed Transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lf7UGfL1g&pp=ygUhYnJlYWsgc2NpZW5jZSBsaWdodCBzcGVlZCB0cmFuc2l0)"". Other good mentions to [Tape B's remix of ""In The Bag""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh7-WvOGa_k&pp=ygURdGFwZSBiIGluIHRoZSBiYWc%3D) and [Subtronic's ""Afternoon Coffee""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6G64Z9IlWk&pp=ygUbc3VidHJvbmljcyBhZnRlcm5vb24gY29mZmVl).

  
Examples of what I'm NOT looking for:

[Peekaboo - Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq5irTmob2w&pp=ygUScGVla2Fib28gbGlrZSB0aGF0): While this is a very vibey and simple stripped down song with fun wubs, its overall energy is too ""in the face"" of the listener to play ""casually"", a bit too overpowering for a lounge setting.

My partner and I  moved to Orpington 3 years ago, and we now have a toddler. While we live near St. Olave’s School in a lovely area, I have to admit I feel quite disheartened when it comes to the High Street.

I’m wondering if anyone else feels the same, or if there’s something I’m missing? Is there any hope for redevelopment of the High Street in the near future? I’d love to hear about any plans or hidden gems I might have overlooked.

We had been talking that night, and I did what I could get her through the night, but it wasn't enough and she took about 50 antidepressants on top of having had a lot to drink. I called an ambulance and went to visit her in the hospital and it's been so hard seeing her this way. She became so out of it from the medicine she took, the alcohol withdrawal, and the medicine they gave her. She kept asking for water but I couldn't give her any because of how much trouble she was having holding the cup or drinking.

My espresso is a blend from a roaster in NC: [Hatchet Coffee's Vesper espresso blend](https://hatchetcoffee.com/products/vesper-espresso-blend). They call out ""milk chocolate and cranberry."" I'm mostly getting the tartness, but none of the milk chocolate. Not particularly sweet. Roast date was 12/31 and I'm nearly through the entire 12oz bag. They describe it as medium roast.

**Process:** Natural

I'm grinding at 1,3,0 on my JX Pro (""zeroed"" in). Water temps have been between 92-96º C or 197-205º F. Dose is 18g in and around 40g out. I'm consistently hitting around 30-36 seconds from the time the first drop registers in the cup (auto timer).

I'm doing pre-infusion at 2-3 bars until I get around 3g in the cup, then ramping up to 6-9bars and holding then letting it drop back down gradually. It's pretty difficult to hold 9 bars steadily. Is that normal? My scale is not BT so I don't have a flow rate yet. (Bookoo is supposed to arrive tomorrow). When the shots are done, the Crema is reddish brown, with a few small flecks of the darkness in the Crema, but it's only about 1/8"" thick.

ETA: It occurs to me to ask is it possible I'm being too gentle with the lever when I'm trying to hold pressure around 7-9 bars? 

It just seems like either I don't have a clue what sweet espresso should taste like; I understand it's not like table sugar, but I've not really gotten anything I'd describe as ""sweet"" yet at all. Or this particular blend isn't that sweet?

I ordered some Counter Culture Hologram because that's a coffee I've brewed a LOT of over the years in V60 so I know it well and know it's got a nice sweetness and body.

Is it possible I'm getting my shots generally in the ballpark and this espresso just doesn't have the flavors I'm looking for? Or is there something that stands out as out of wack?

1i3n0ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1i3n0ij/im_addicted_to_coke_zero_and_cant_stop/,I’m addicted to Coke Zero and can’t stop.,"I’m addicted to Coke Zero and can’t stop.

A few years ago, when I found out that Coke Zero had no sugar or calories, I started consuming it obsessively. Over time, this turned into an addiction, and now I just can’t stop.

It all started about two years ago when I began intermittent fasting. Coke Zero was my way of cheating the system—it doesn’t technically break the rules of fasting and is a common tool to curb sweet cravings without ruining your results.

Yes, during the toughest moments of fasting, Coke Zero saved me. Sleepless nights, sacrificing sleep for the sake of caloric deficits, led me to lean on this mythical sweetened soda. It was incredibly effective, and fasting became easy and even enjoyable for me after that.

I started drinking at least 1.5 liters daily. On particularly hot or stressful days, I could finish a 2-liter bottle in one go, alone.

It seemed like a dream: the more Coke Zero I drank, the less hungry I felt, and the more weight I lost. I started at 135 kg, and by the time I was drinking the most Coke Zero, I had dropped to 115 kg. I was quickly approaching my goal of 100 kg.

Soon, the habit spread to all parts of my day. At some point, every meal had to be accompanied by a can of Coke Zero. I mostly eat out, which luckily wasn’t a problem since it’s available almost everywhere.

And the burps. Oh, the pleasure! Not in public, of course, but at home, I’d burp like crazy. After mastering it, every sip produced a loud burp. My neighbors probably thought someone new had moved in since they’d never heard me burp before.

At night, I’d feel a sweet taste lingering in my mouth, making me salivate all night, like when you pop a sour candy. That sensation lasted till morning. Speaking of mornings, every other day, I’d swap my sacred morning coffee for a Coke Coffee (which could be a whole other post, but let’s not go there now).

Unlike my friends, I don’t drink alcohol or do drugs, but at every hangout, there I was with two 2-liter bottles of Coke Zero. Most of the time, I drank it all myself, though I’d offer it to my friends as a mixer for whiskey or cachaça.

I crunched the numbers: I was spending over 450 reais a month just on Coke Zero. That was one 2-liter bottle per night and a can or so during the day, plus extra on weekends. To cut costs, I started buying in bulk—but instead of saving money, I ended up drinking even more because it was so convenient to have crates of Coke Zero just a few steps from my desk.

Soon, Coke Zero replaced water for me. Actually, it was more than that because drinking so much Coke Zero made me reduce my water intake drastically. A 20-liter water jug would last over a month, and I stopped feeling thirsty—except for Coke Zero. Amazingly, my body never complained about the lack of water.

When I reached 110 kg, I was happy with my weight and gave up fasting, which had been an extreme way to lose weight. But not Coke Zero. It stayed, and now I can’t quit.

One stressful week at work pushed my Coke Zero consumption even higher. To cope, I drank a can every time something annoyed me. When my cousin visited, he saw me taking out a 50-liter trash bag stuffed with empty Coke bottles and cans. He asked if it was from the entire month, and I shamefully admitted it was just one week’s worth.

He questioned whether this was healthy, but I shrugged it off, saying, “It’s sugar-free, calorie-free, so it’s not a big deal. It’s just some sweeteners and preservatives—not like it’ll give me diabetes or anything.”

Deep down, I knew I’d eventually have to stop. But that realization wasn’t enough to wake me up.

Then I lost some extra income from work, around 1,000 reais a month. It wasn’t as bad as being fired, but it still hit me hard financially. I tried cutting Coke Zero out of my budget—it was a huge expense, and the end of the month was looming.

But I couldn’t do it. The withdrawal was stronger than my willpower, and I ended up using my credit card, bingeing on Coke Zero for two weeks straight. I considered paying the bill in installments, gradually cutting back, and eventually quitting.

That never happened. Instead, I rebounded and consumed even more Coke Zero than ever.

One weekend, I stacked 25 large cans of Coke Zero into a pyramid in my room. In the back of my mind, I knew I couldn’t pay off my credit card bill. I’d already split it into installments twice, and now the bank wanted the full amount, or they’d report me to credit protection services.

But I didn’t care. All that mattered was drinking Coke Zero. Going to bed with a full belly, the rest be damned.

My name got blacklisted, and I couldn’t pay the debt. The bank tried to garnish my salary, but I dodged it since the law protects wages. I ended up taking out a loan. As a public employee, I qualified for payroll loans, which are deducted straight from your paycheck. Only God knows how much interest I paid on the 10,000 reais I borrowed to fix my financial situation.

As soon as the money hit my account, though, I couldn’t resist. I kept spending around 750 reais a month on Coke Zero. I have no idea where this will end.

This is my reality now. Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. I know you’ll probably want to help, but I’m not going to reply. I’m just here to vent, and I know if I truly wanted to fix this, I would.

I know I’m a Coke Zero-addicted little b\*tch, but thanks to internet anonymity, I can express myself and share my thoughts without ruining my real-life reputation.

Feel free to judge me, call it fake, whatever.

Thanks for your attention.

This parking lot has a drive thru coffee place that always has a really long line that often winds around the lot.


I drove by the line of cars and happened to pass by a few cars really close (1-3 inches I’d guess). There was plenty more space I could have given them; I don’t know why, that was just how close I ended up getting to them. I was going really slow though and didn’t hit/scratch them. Also, there’s no law against passing by another car close (just against tailgating from behind), so what I did was 100% legal.


That didn’t stop the driver of one of the cars (a middle aged guy) from getting out of his car, marching over to the space I parked in, and lecturing me that I got “too close” to his car. This really pissed me off, that he thinks he has the right to police my completely legal driving. In the absence of a law, that’s just his personal opinion, I'm entitled to do it if I want. It reminds me of woke people that try to cancel other people for their free speech.


I told him off, telling him stuff like “go f*** yourself”, that I'm entitled to get as close to his car as I wish, and made fun of how shitty and old and crappy looking his car was compared to mine. The guy was this flabby beta male who’s lucky if he could bench press one third of what I can, so I said all this with no fear. After a few minutes he got mad and stormed back to his car (where his wife was waiting), calling me a “douchebag” as he made his way back.


I was still really mad, and felt I had more to say to him. I stormed over to his car (which was still waiting in the coffee shop line), pulled out my phone, and started blasting the most recent song on my Spotify playlist (which was “London Bridge” by Fergie).


I improvised and sang my own lyrics over the original ones, making it a song about how I have every right to get as close to his car as I want, and danced around his car as I sang. For example, the main lyric where she sings, “How come every time you come around my London London bridge,” I sung over it to the same beat/tone “I’m entitled to get as close to your car as I f***ing want” and flipped up both my middle fingers and shook them around in the air every time I finished this lyric. I did this for about 2 minutes before he pulled his car out of the line and sped off, giving me the middle finger.

I have to work fast, but I feel like when I do, I get a bit sloppy in the way I carry myself, and can forget to add that bit of finesse to customer service. I am worried about this because the place is a bit higher end, so that impression matters in this context. 

I would also like to see if anyone has any tips to not get too overwhelmed when there is a rush. If there is a way to work rather fast without activating your nervous system and whipping yourself up in a fight or flight frenzy?",5,1737138053.0,barista,14,1.0,False

Long time lurker of this subreddit but finally asking a question.

I own a Baratza encore that I use for my daily coffee grinding.

For myself I usually do v60 or I just got a switch that I’ve started playing around with. 

I usually make coffee for myself every morning and I feel like the more I read, more and more people are using hand grinders.  I see lots of names and short hands so trying to figure out what’s “best” in terms of my next purchase.  

The ones I see a lot are the comandante and 1zpresso?  Open to other suggestions but looking to explore more in terms of grinders. ",1,1737137850.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while drinking tea and having a smoke I’m watching a Dutch streamer play phasmophobia .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

I met a girl about 8, 9 years ago. I fel for her in an instant. I was an still am captivated by her in all possible ways.

For about a year, while she had a boyfriend, we chatted and flirted a lot, stole a kiss once. After that I criticised her about her indecisiveness, which drove us apart, but we quickly reconnected. That evolved into some kind of a relationship after she broke up with her boyfriend, that lasted for a few months, in 2018. We really had a good time together, though I'd say we certainly did not see each other enough. She broke up with me, saying that I was a rebound and that she doesn't feel anything towards me. She wanted to stay friends, always saying how much I meant to her, but I always demanded more, constantly expressing my love and I often erupted in anger, brought out by anxiety, unhealthy attachment, and, what I believe, a lack of resolution.

We had a stormy few years with no contact periods due to arguing, but still meeting every few months. I had a feeling she wanted me to keep tethered in some way, but never letting it grow deeper. It was like we knew that we would end up mad at each other. She pretty much always had some guy after that, with various levels of seriousness. All that turmoil, combined with family issues and work related stress, led to an episode of depression, due to which I had a four month sick leave. That was until late 2021 when shit really hit the fan, when we met up for a really nice evening, after which I was shocked when she told me she had a serious boyfriend. It was not jelaousy, more like feeling betrayed, as I would certainly not treat her the same or said some things, If I was aware of that. Not that I wouldn't do or say these things, but in certainly in a different way. After that we kept things to a complete minimum.

I kinda found new interests and picked up a few hobbies to help with the mood, and managed to bury her in my memories. Besides being a bit shy, I don't really have issues with meeting new people, I had girlfriends before, but whenever I had a shot with another girl, she was in the back of my mind. That prevented me from developing any deeper feelings for any girl, despite finding her cute, hot, uplifting, ...

That brings us to late 2024, when we reconnected randomly. I think I was on a critical point at that time. We started off really sweet, everything felt good and natural, we flirted(?) and such. I told her what I feel abot her early on. After we continued for a few weeks, she never said it outright, but hinted at her having a boyfriend, but continued in the same manner as before. She sent me a long message, saying that she was sorry for her past behaviour and that she truly wished to reconnect. I again told her what I felt about her, and only then she made it clear she has a serious boyfriend and that she is not in any way interested in me. That, combined with some other things again sent me into depression, but I handeled it better, only lasting about two weeks. We met up for a coffee\lunch since then, but it was cool as hell. We keep in contact, though I think she is ever more avoidant and less recipient.

The only thing I feel for her is love and I care too much. I know that I'm a terminally online guy, that I can be demanding in the sense of how much information I share, that I am a disagreeable person with attachment issues and that I am enmeshing, and she has made me well aware of all my shortcomings in that sense. Through the years, I managed to filter out most of the toxicity, but the love remains. I don't expect anything from her anymore, nor does her opinion matter as much as it did.

Advice?

Also, feel free to ask for details, I kinda rushed, and my memory is all over the place.",3,1737137592.0,Codependency,1,1.0,False
