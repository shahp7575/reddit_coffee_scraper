1jbfsbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1jbfsbr/blooming/,Blooming,"Hi!  

Im making cold brew using the french press method. 

I read recently to reduce bitterness, we are supposed to bloom coffee grounds using hot water to release CO2. 

I experimented with this for a while and Im bot sure if its the right way to do it. 

What I do normally is grind up coffee beans and normally let it soak in cold water for few minutes and agitate those.  Then fill the french press with cold water. After 12+ hours I plunge and pour out into a container. 

Lately I do the same but soak grounds in hot water for few minutes before adding cold water.

I keep forgetting stuff after a day. And occasionally I get anxiety about stuff I shouldn't. The other day (bringing this up to a therapist)... I got anxious about a camera hidden behind my rear view mirror... got anxious that my brain is connecting to others sometimes... then proceeded to forget about it. Started driving home and it came back up and i was thinking about how much it sucked that i was being watched in the car... (and a bunch of ideas on how a camera and battery would be able to last any length of time)

Thoughts about something on campus and i had 0 brain fog and everything was great then later I suddenly forgot what I was thinking about. Felt like someone accidentally pressed the wrong button, dialed the rate my neurons fire at up too high, then had to dial it back down and clear my memory of that.

yk but its fine I proceeded to entirely forget about all that. Unless I mentally bring it up and it kinda re-sparks my anxiety. I'm aware I shouldn't think about that sort of stuff.

Now if i didn't have any brain fog would I constantly be remembering all of that? That would explain why coffee sometimes gives me paranoia and sometimes doesn't and I feel better mentally after quitting coffee (but if i quit coffee for too long I go back into thinking about things I shouldn't think about).

Coffee spikes everything, but i only drink 1-2 cups.. maybe 3 I'll be thinking about xyz a bunch then tell myself its weird, then I quit coffee and everything calms. (and occasionally I have a moment where I fully realize how weird the idea is but it doesnt last)

I remember I quit coffee once and just got convinced it was keeping me in/out (wasnt sure which) out of some sort of simulation. Went entirely caffine free cause of it.

Going to speak to a therapist cause part of me is trying to convince myself its not an issue at all and I'm  starting to agree honestly. Ik I shouldn't but whatever. (feels like an insignificant issue some days. )

I have other reasons I need to talk to one as well. (also i feel close to as forgetful as my grandparent who has mostly recovered from had brain surgery but i'm probs overstating it cause i'm doing ok in my classes and am not struggling with math heavy courses while making stupid mistakes with anything non-academic(burnout maybe)) My mind seemingly, usually, barely has any thoughts and is empty.

Insects chirping and dancing among the concrete ruins of capitalism signaled the arrival of dusk. For some reason or another, Harrison imagined that the afterhours of the Deep Dish Diner in Los Lunares would‚Äôve been more lively, but nope. That was fine. As one might have imagined, a man with the last name of ‚ÄòGraves‚Äô didn‚Äôt do ‚Äòlively‚Äô very well.

Nighttime was meant for reading. A pair of rectangular reading glasses sat on the bridge of his nose, looking down at the first book in a two-part series that he‚Äôd probably read a dozen times over, just to relax in the familiarity of it all if nothing else.

Harrison already knew how it‚Äôd all end. The woman that fell through the mirror would end up with the lovable young man that brought her through the multiverse by accident. A story with a happy ending? Imagine that.

The waitress approached. ‚ÄúWhat can I get‚Äôchu, hun?‚Äù she asked.

Country-fried steak. Chicken with gravy. Grand slam hamburger. None of these happened to appeal to his tastes at the moment, given the terrible string of missing persons and butchery he‚Äôd had been lightly following for the past few weeks. Harrison took one more glance at the menu and sighed. ‚ÄúA signature blend to start.‚Äù

With a nod, the waitress jotted down the request and pinned it to the dwindling roster of orders at the back of the counter.

Things were okay.

People came and went. Few lingered, likely weighed down by their own troubles or perhaps simply enjoying a coffee near the witching hour, both of which he‚Äôd become rather accustomed to on his own time. Harrison casually flicked a page between his fingers, his gaze fixated on the material of his mental escape as he waited.

The true problem? Things were not okay. In fact, things were so completely not okay tonight that no one seemed to notice the glaring problem coming into view from the depths of the fog outside.

Under darkness, it hunted. Like lightning, it struck.

As the darkest day of the year crept further from its hole and upon man, so did the monsters that hid beneath its belly. Heavy footfalls echoed down the increasingly empty streets, followed by the rush of crisp autumnal winds carrying the faint chorus of thunder. Some would've called it ominous. The man known as Harrison Graves found it far more terrifying.

Shallow gasps intermingled with a light pattering of rain, each of their steps sending an upheaval of grimy water, but dirtied boots were the least of his worries as his partner got snapped into the air like a ragdoll. Any pleas or screams she may have had lingering on the tip of her tongue were silenced with a sickening splatter of crimson on the pavement.

No time to care nor any inkling of pity for the woman was present. With an increased drive to survive, the man rushed past a fallen street light, which had the unfortunate effect of leaving whatever followed in the dark, its winged shadow beating furiously for blood.

Up ahead lied an abandoned fishery - the designated safehouse for his people (although he loathed to call them such) and their endeavors. ""Iron!"" the man blurted, arms flailing and seemingly insane as he made his approach. ""It doesn't like iron!""

Fortunately, someone heard him. Unfortunately, they didn't listen. One of the guards, a boorish man of impressive size, slipped out from behind one of the old delivery garages. A war cry bellowed from his throat, loud enough to rival the excessive number of shots that cracked through the night at an invisible foe.

Harrison took this opportunity to dive inside the relative safety of the fishery just as his meathead friend laid his eyes on the last light he'd ever see. Whoever he was mattered about as much as his smoldering remains did now.",1,1741987693.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False

Shallow gasps intermingled with a light pattering of rain, each of their steps sending an upheaval of grimy water, but dirtied boots were the least of his worries as his partner got snapped into the air like a ragdoll. Any pleas or screams she may have had lingering on the tip of her tongue were silenced with a sickening splatter of crimson on the pavement.

No time to care nor any inkling of pity for the woman was present. With an increased drive to survive, the man rushed past a fallen street light, which had the unfortunate effect of leaving whatever followed in the dark, its winged shadow beating furiously for blood.

Up ahead lied an abandoned fishery - the designated safehouse for his people (although he loathed to call them such) and their endeavors. ""Iron!"" the man blurted, arms flailing and seemingly insane as he made his approach. ""It doesn't like iron!""

Fortunately, someone heard him. Unfortunately, they didn't listen. One of the guards, a boorish man of impressive size, slipped out from behind one of the old delivery garages. A war cry bellowed from his throat, loud enough to rival the excessive number of shots that cracked through the night at an invisible foe.

Harrison took this opportunity to dive inside the relative safety of the fishery just as his meathead friend laid his eyes on the last light he'd ever see. Whoever he was mattered about as much as his smoldering remains did now.",1,1741987682.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

1jbeopm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1jbeopm/mental_health_microbiome/,Mental health & Microbiome,"Hello, I‚Äôm a young male adult, healthy and with good mental health history. Over the last year or so I‚Äôve been getting sinusitis each time I get sick with the flu or a cold. Each time I get prescribed antibiotics to help me get over it. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve taken antibiotics 4 times in the last year and a half and I realize I shouldn‚Äôt have accepted them so quickly. 

I was recently prescribed Clindamycin in the middle of January for 7 days, 3 times daily. On Day 6 of taking it, I started to feel off, dizzy, nauseas and brain fog. On February 1st, I started to feel depressed and some slight anxiety, it also felt like I was in a dream (depersonalization). The depression went away and I don‚Äôt remember if the DP did or not but I felt ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. Around February 15th, I had a few beers and then drank some kefir a day later and finished most of it within a few days. Things started to get worse, the DP was worse, the depression was worse and I got hit with derealization and anxiety. Last few days of February, I had half a glass of wine and a beer a few days later and the very next day, everything came crashing down much worse and I experienced my first ever panic attack. It felt like I was losing my mind. 

I started to take a Magnesium glycinate/malate/taurate mix and Vitamin D3 along with SAMe and I quite drinking coffee every day, I will also never touch alcohol again. Within 4 days everything improved greatly. I felt so great and all my symptoms including the brain fog cleared up nicely. I decided to take a 50B CFU multi-strain probiotic and on Day 3 of taking it I got hit with anxiety, high heart rate, heart flutters and depression. I immediately stopped taking it. On Day 4 of not taking it, I felt the depersonalization come back somewhat. Not as bad as before, but it‚Äôs there. I‚Äôm on Day 6 of not taking it and the anxiety and depression have cleared up mostly, I still get hit with a little irrational anxiety early in the morning but it‚Äôs clearing up more each day I think. I‚Äôm still dealing with the depersonalization and it‚Äôs pretty frustrating. I seem to be getting better and see that others reported negative side effects of probiotics cleared within 1-3 weeks after not taking them anymore. 

Should I continue to give it time or be concerned? Did the antibiotics wipe out my gut microbiome? Why did the magnesium work so quickly? Is the depersonalization likely a result of the anxiety I was experiencing and my body needs time to readjust? I don‚Äôt have parents anymore and I‚Äôm self supporting, really just curious if anyone has had similar experiences especially with the probiotics and what I should do next. Thanks in advance!

First, funniest and worst story ever. Left my laptop I use for work open on a coffee table at my girlfriend‚Äôs house. Her fucking dog, a large dog, emptied his entire bladder directly into my keyboard on my Lenovo P17. Tried to save it when I got home and found it, but basically every single board is severely corroded and I‚Äôve now got a very expensive paperweight. When I picked it up, it was filled with a pint glass full of piss that then went all over the floor and it had been sitting for up to 90 minutes or so like that. Unsalvageable. 

I need to acquire a new laptop and I‚Äôve settled on a 2024 ROG Strix G18 with the 4080. I don‚Äôt actually game on PC (other than OLD school titles like StarCraft haha) - but I do render for a couple hours a day for work on most days. I don‚Äôt think I can justify the extra cost of another A5000.

So, long story short‚Ä¶ do these tend to go on sale as ‚Äúlast years models‚Äù sometime soon - or should I just bite the bullet and pay the 2800 bucks for the one that meets my needs. I could slug through a few weeks on the old 8th gen i7 I have, but it is not a viable long term solution as at some point, there is a crossover of saving money versus my reduced output over the course of weeks, when I‚Äôm going to have to spring for a new one anyway.

I see the 2025‚Äôs are coming out, and don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be kicking myself because in 3 weeks, I could have saved 600 bucks, etc.

I wanted to share what seems to be a win - I'm cautious to declare victory yet.

Thar last few months had been particularly bad. In December, the depression and anger hit a new low. And that was it, I was ready to try an SSRI. I tried sitraline, and I felt worse and had a headache lasting 6 consecutive days... So that's wasn't it. Fast forward to now, March. I decided WHAT THE HECK: I will go 100% on all the recommended supplements and see if anything helps. And from there, I'll evaluate my next move. I decided to journal my symptoms every day, starting at ovulation.

And wouldn't you know: this cycle has been the EASIEST in SO LONG!! It's by no means perfect, but a weight lifted? Bandwidth? Experiencing joy? Gosh, that is worth gold.

I've still had some lingering anxiety pop-up here and there, but it's just not on the same level. The intrusive voice is, without jinxing it, barely noticeable. There's been a tiny bit of brain fog, but less, and also less frequent. No depression. Energy. Better sleep. No rage.

So here's what I've been doing differently.

3000mg of taurine every single day. No, ""I forgot."" I've been doing 1000mg with coffee in the AM + 2000mg before bed with my magnesium glycinate.

I've also been diligent in taking my NAC daily for inflammation, zinc, and B6 vitamin.

On top of all this, I take berberine and quercetin before my meals. Berberine works WONDERS for my blood sugar regulation, it regulates my appetite and stops my cravings. 

I think the taurine and magnesium are helping the most out of everything, and berberine is an amazing support for insulin resistance during lutheal phase.

Additional supplements I take: vit D, iron, omega-3.

OpenAI advocates for comprehensive federal policies to bolster AI innovation and equitable access across the United States. The proposed AI Action Plan includes establishing robust national AI infrastructure, equitable distribution of AI benefits, and forming an AI consortium for best practices in security and ethics.

* OpenAI warns that the 781 state-level AI bills introduced this year could hinder American innovation and competitiveness against China's AI ambitions.
* The proposal includes additional calls for infrastructure investment, copyright reform, and expanding access to government datasets for AI development.
* They notably called out China‚Äôs ‚Äúunfettered access to data‚Äù, calling the race for AI ‚Äòeffectively over‚Äô if fair use copyright laws are not applied in the U.S.
* OpenAI also pushed for the U.S government to ban models like DeepSeek due to security risks, calling the lab ‚Äústate-controlled‚Äù.

# ü§ù Spies Targeting $100M US AI Secrets Encapsulated in Just a Few Lines of Code

Recent incidents highlight the vulnerability of U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) intellectual property to espionage. For example, former Google engineer Linwei Ding was indicted on charges of stealing AI trade secrets to benefit Chinese companies. Ding allegedly transferred confidential information, including data center designs and chip blueprints, to his personal accounts while secretly working for Chinese firms.

**What this means:**¬†The theft of AI trade secrets poses significant risks to national security and economic competitiveness. Such breaches can lead to unauthorized access to advanced technologies, potentially costing U.S. companies millions in lost revenue and compromising their competitive edge.

And yet I am chronically dehydrated because I constantly forget to drink water. Multiple doctors have commented on it recently.

But if the fridge is empty (like right now) getting myself to restock it is another thing all together.

I recently went through the whole ordeal, and ugh, it‚Äôs like trying to juggle flaming swords while blindfolded. But I came out the other side with a few tricks (and a lil' help) that might save someone else from losing their mind.

First off, label everything like a mad scientist. I mean, not just ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù or ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù ‚Äì be super specific. Write ""soup spoons"" instead of just ""utensils,"" or ""Wednesday bed sheets"" instead of just ""sheets."" Future you will thank you when you‚Äôre knee-deep in boxes and just want to crash.

Also, grabbing some high-quality bubble wrap and packing paper saved my stuff. I went a bit overboard with the wrapping, but hey, better safe than sorry, right? And if you‚Äôve still got those ginormous IKEA bags somewhere, they‚Äôre surprisingly useful for hauling a ton of stuff that‚Äôs awkwardly shaped.

Now, here‚Äôs the kicker. I was REALLY dreading the whole moving day chaos, but a friend tipped me off to Grizzly Moving. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but they ended up making the process so much easier. The crew was super chill and helped me feel less like I was going to pull my hair out and more like I was just awkwardly relocating all the ghost living in my closet, haha.

One last tip ‚Äì have an ‚Äúopen first‚Äù box with essentials like coffee, a snack, and maybe a set of non-ghost-filled sheets. Crazy how much of a lifesaver that was.

Anyways, not gonna lie, the whole experience made me think, ‚ÄúIs teleportation too much to ask for?‚Äù But until then, hope someone finds this helpful and less stressful than mine! üôÉ",1,1741986030.0,RentSanDiego,0,1.0,False

The dinner party is in full swing. Susie‚Äôs at the head of the table, Jeff‚Äôs next to her, and Larry‚Äôs seated between Cheryl and a new guest, DR. MARVIN, a pompous neurologist. The table‚Äôs buzzing with conversation. 

SUSIE: Larry, you gotta try this salmon. It‚Äôs phenomenal.
LARRY: (smiling) Oh, it looks fantastic, Susie. Really great job. 

But as he speaks, his hands mime gagging and tossing the salmon over his shoulder. Susie‚Äôs face drops. 

SUSIE: What the fuck, Larry?! You‚Äôre gonna trash-talk my cooking with your little hand puppets?
LARRY: No, no, I didn‚Äôt mean that! I love salmon! (His hands start frantically rubbing his stomach like he‚Äôs about to puke.)
CHERYL: (whispering) Larry, what‚Äôs wrong with you?
DR. MARVIN: (adjusting his glasses) Fascinating. Could be a dissociative motor tic. Have you seen a specialist?
LARRY: (pointing at Dr. Marvin) Oh, you‚Äôre a genius, huh? Thanks for the input. 

His hands, however, give Dr. Marvin two enthusiastic thumbs-up, then a sarcastic slow clap.

SUSIE: (glaring at Larry) He‚Äôs a goddamn menace, that‚Äôs what.
LARRY: I‚Äôm not a menace! (His hands start waving jazz hands.) This is involuntary!

Larry‚Äôs meeting Leon for coffee. He‚Äôs wearing oven mitts to keep his hands under control. 

LEON: Man, why you look like you‚Äôre about to bake a damn cake?
LARRY: My hands are betraying me, Leon. Everything I say, they do the opposite. I got kicked out of Susie‚Äôs last night.
LEON: (laughing) That‚Äôs some next-level shit. Like your hands are snitching on your brain.
LARRY: It‚Äôs not funny! (Hands, in mitts, start flailing like he‚Äôs conducting an orchestra.) I need to fix this. 

A BARISTA walks over with their coffees. 

BARISTA: Here you go, sir. Enjoy!
LARRY: Thanks so much, looks great. 

The mitts shoot up, thumbs-down style. The barista frowns and walks away. 

LEON: Oh, you‚Äôre fucked, man. You just dissed her tip game. 

Larry groans, slamming his mitt-covered hands on the table‚Äîaccidentally knocking over Leon‚Äôs coffee.

Act 3

INT. DR. MARVIN‚ÄôS OFFICE - DAY
Larry‚Äôs sitting across from Dr. Marvin, mitts off, trying to explain his problem. 

LARRY: So, Doc, what‚Äôs the deal? Am I crazy?
DR. MARVIN: Not crazy. It‚Äôs likely a rare neurological glitch‚Äîyour motor cortex and prefrontal cortex are misaligned. Your hands are expressing your subconscious

LARRY: My subconscious hates me! (Hands start clapping like he‚Äôs thrilled.) Can you fix it?
DR. MARVIN: We could try cognitive behavioral therapy, maybe some meds. But tell me, what‚Äôs your real issue here? 

Larry sighs, leaning forward. 

LARRY: I just want people to stop hating me. (Hands mime a big ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù shrug.)
DR. MARVIN: (smirking) Well, your hands seem to think you‚Äôre fine with it. 

Larry glares at his hands, which now point at Dr. Marvin accusingly. 

LARRY: Traitors. 

Final Scene

EXT. SUSIE AND JEFF‚ÄôS HOUSE - NIGHT
Larry shows up with flowers to apologize. Susie opens the door, arms crossed. 

SUSIE: What do you want, freakshow?
LARRY: Susie, I‚Äôm sorry about last night. (Hands start tossing imaginary trash at her.) It‚Äôs a condition! I‚Äôm seeing a doctor!
SUSIE: A condition? You‚Äôre full of shit, Larry. (She sniffs the flowers.) These smell like ass, too. 

His hands give her a big ‚Äúcome here‚Äù hug gesture while he backs away. 

LARRY: Okay, I‚Äôll go. (Hands: ‚Äústay, stay!‚Äù) Just know I didn‚Äôt mean it! 

Susie slams the door. Larry turns to leave, hands now waving bye-bye like a toddler. He stops, stares at them, and sighs. 

LARRY: (to hands) You‚Äôre killing me here. 

He walks off into the night as a neighbor across the street flips him off‚ÄîLarry‚Äôs hands wave back cheerfully.

We all march for different reasons and that is why we stand up and march against the tyranny we will not tolerate. When you join your neighbors in this fight to protect everyone‚Äôs rights and freedoms in a democracy and to demand truth, justice and ethics in government, know that ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù will be there speaking with you. Our next demonstration of ***The Power of the People*** is March 29, 2025 - **Crush the Coup!**

This is an A to Z Peaceful Protest: every fascist executive order, scotus opinion, racism, sexism, ageism, and more‚Ä¶

This is an A to Z March: Advocating for every attacked group. (partial list: veterans, disabled/uniquely abled, immigrants, civil servants, healthcare, medicaid, medicare, social security, first amendment rights, the constitution, government services‚Ä¶ you know all of the issues!)¬†

Our People are being hurt by the flood of assaults in an unprecedented ‚Äúsoft coup‚Äù to lower taxes for corporations and billionaires who do not pay their fair share and who receive subsidies from us in a system they have rigged for years! This Fascist Regime must be stomped out and crushed, never to regain power in the United States Democracy (i.e. a system of rule by the people) and Republic (i.e. public good/representative democracy) again.

If you want another way to Stand Up for your democracy, values, and rights, to have your voice heard, then this march is for you!¬†

Let‚Äôs make it Count!

Peace and Power to The People.

Organized by regular everyday people volunteering/working to protect democracy. This march is wheelchair accessible. Plenty of on-street and structure parking. The course is 1.5 flat miles and will conclude at Liberty Plaza. Individuals wishing to walk part of the march can easily shorten the distance because of the small city block sizes. Many local coffee shops and restaurants within very short walking distance. Detailed Route forthcoming. Possible addition of speakers at noon prior to march. Many Volunteer Organizations will be represented by the marchers and there will be time for networking at Liberty Plaza.

Starbucks was the only happiness at RUH to a dark and horrible time with a family member over 3 months.

¬†

On this day in HNF History, In the EP [Raisins = White Hot Sauce](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2oJXBxlX9dNRDaBSi5gZD9) Neal & Bianca discuss Woody Allen‚Äôs memoir being dropped by publisher Hachette, and employees of the company that published[ Ronan Farrow‚Äôs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronan_Farrow#) ( family member of Allen‚Äôs Accuser and celebrated investigative journalist) book, walking out in support of Farrow and in protest of Allen.¬†



Although Allen was found innocent in the initial trial, it‚Äôs important to note that in most cases like these, when the accused is tried in court, the cases rarely result in a conviction due to the fact that adult victims, who were children at the time of the alleged crimes, have to wait to request prosecution, as recounting the crime as a child is often too traumatizing. From experience, the system of adult support that is present won‚Äôt typically side with the victims and are by and large implicitly responsible for the misconduct making it too challenging to prosecute at the time.¬† Most victims of crime require entire teams, lawyers and therapists, and require financial distance from the accused in order to have the courage to come forward. This conflicts with investigators ability to inquire, as the time lapse is often too great, and the statute of limitations commonly expires in crimes like this.¬†



This is where ‚ÄúCancel Culture‚Äù comes in. A comparison is made by Neal and Bianca to blackface, with a sick reference to [Amos N‚Äô Andy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_%27n%27_Andy) ( a rarely talked about but very influential comedy property. For reference every modern day episodic comedy show is formatted after this historic show).¬†



The question Neal and Bianca pose about blackface is what makes the practice a cancelable offense compared to others such as using transphobic slurs or in this case, being accused of sexual misconduct. The idea is that just because something is looked down upon (such as blackface), doesn‚Äôt mean that people don‚Äôt participate unchecked everyday. The idea behind cancel culture is that the community feels there needs to be a form of accountability, if the collective perceives that justice is not quite being served. The social persecution experienced by Woody Allen is how the corporate conscience engages in these cases. When the courts seem to fail the victims, how does the collective show up? The protest at Hachette publishing is an example of how that might happen.¬†¬†



Woody Allen once said of these allegations towards him, this would insight the beginning of a ‚ÄúWitch Hunt.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt incorrect. Shortly after these allegations went public, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and Jefferey Epstein were all investigated, tried and convicted of misconduct and abuse. So, I guess, shout out to Woody Allen for always remaining a pioneer in comedy, film and television.¬†



In the episode [‚ÄúToe Tag Time‚Äù](https://youtu.be/E0wKawxAUCg?si=qgoJfTZumncgs9Oy) nearly a year later on the nose, during their Doc Watch segment, Neal and Bianca discuss the allegations through the lens of the HBO documentary ‚ÄúAllen VS Farrow.‚Äù Neal describes the documentary not as journalism but rather an analysis of Allen‚Äôs psychopathy through the filter of his body of work, which in whole reveals a preoccupation with much younger women.¬† Neal declares with admonishment ‚ÄúRead the room, no, read the earth!‚Äù An honest admonition of a clearly unhealthy obsession on the part of Allen. Allen‚Äôs descriptions of his romantic inclinations do read like the main character in Andre Gide‚Äôs *The Immoralist* ( A book I cannot recommend intensely enough. I was uncomfortable from beginning to end, it will have you screaming on your bus ride ‚Äúbro, get help!‚Äù¬† Allen, without an honest lens, like Gide‚Äôs protagonist Michel might perceive his inclinations as beautiful or poetic.¬†

As consumers of Allen‚Äôs plays, works, art, etc ‚Äì are we, without holding him sincerely accountable, also deriving a pleasure or fulfillment from his exploits, artistic or otherwise via catharsis? It is certainly probable.¬†



Enjoy these EPS once again. Bianca as always, is absolutely stunning, and Neal is still ‚ÄúBaby Girl‚Äù and cute AF.

Hey everyone!

I‚Äôm a 32-year-old guy from Michigan who‚Äôs all about the outdoors‚Äîhiking, kayaking, camping, and just soaking up nature when the weather‚Äôs nice. When it‚Äôs not? You‚Äôll probably find me curled up with a good book, binge-watching a show, or sipping on some coffee.

A little about me:

5‚Äô10‚Äù, athletic build, green eyes, brown hair
Friendly, laid-back, and a bit sarcastic‚Äîlove to laugh and joke around
Love language is physical touch, so if you‚Äôre a hugger, we‚Äôll get along great
Into cooking, hanging with friends, and just enjoying good company
Non-smoker, rare drinker, no drugs
I‚Äôm looking to meet new people, make some friends, and if something more happens naturally, even better! Open to chatting with anyone cool, whether you‚Äôre local or not. So, if you‚Äôre up for good conversation, sharing some laughs, or even planning an adventure, shoot me a message!

Alright, team, let‚Äôs chat about time blocking. You know, that thing we all swear by but somehow still fail at? üôÑ I used to think *just* color-coding my calendar would magically make me a productivity guru. Spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt. Let's unravel this mess and find our 10 hours back every week. Promise, it‚Äôs not sorcery!

**Here's the deal:**

Ever blocked out a chunk of time for a task and then spent it procrastinating or doomscrolling? You're not alone. Who knew cat videos could be THAT captivating? üê± Let‚Äôs make that an exception, not the rule.

**1. *Don‚Äôt focus too much on the ‚Äòwhen.‚Äô***

I know, sounds counterintuitive because time blocking is all about, well, *time.* But hear me out. Instead of obsessing over when you‚Äôll get something done, think about *how long* it actually takes. Spend a week logging how long your tasks take‚Äîyup, even counting those 15-minute TikTok breaks. **Knowledge is power.**

**2. Prioritize like a boss.**

Ask yourself: what's really important? What‚Äôs going to impact your day or week the most? Write down top priorities first thing in the a.m. **Morning coffee optional, but recommended. ‚òï**

**3. Embrace flexibility.**

A bit of chaos is natural. Flat tire? Surprise meeting? Suddenly your perfectly crafted schedule is a smoldering wreck. Instead of being too rigid, think of your time blocks as pliable. Kind of like that stretchy toy you had as a kid that refused to break no matter how much you tugged at it.

**4. Focus on energy cycles.**

Morning person or a night owl? Use your peak energy times for high-focus tasks. Then, let the less thrilling stuff (hello, emails) fill the lower-energy gaps. The result? An energy-optimized day! ‚ö°

**5. Celebrate the small wins.**

Checked off a task? High-five yourself! üéâ It's all progress, no matter how small. The little wins are stepping stones to reclaiming those 10 elusive hours.

Remember, time blocking isn‚Äôt just for Type-A folks. It's for anyone who wants to squeeze more out of their day WITHOUT sacrificial lambs (a.k.a. sanity or sleep). üõå

1jbdko8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jbdko8,My Very Mundane Trip Report From Newark Penn to Baltimore Penn And Back,"Spouse and I are living in north Jersey for a year, and in that time I have really fallen head over heels with train travel, even though I mostly just use Amtrak to get back and forth from Baltimore (where I have family), and then use NJTransit to get to NYC. This Sunday was really only my third Amtrak trip, but the first time we went down and back on the same day. 

There's a band that we discovered due to a festival we go to in California, but they are Baltimore band, and we wanted to see them in their native habitat before we move. We found out that they would be opening for another band in a bar very near Baltimore Penn and decided to take the train to see them. Our original plan was to take the NER 87 down so we would arrive an hour before the doors opened, find a place in Baltimore for dinner, then go watch the show. We knew we'd have to leave before it was over in order to catch the 128 back, but we were going for the opening act, anyway. But then they added a second opening act and moved doors open time an hour earlier, so we instead opted for an Amtrak cafe dinner.

The train arrived pretty much exactly on time, trundling in about 4 minutes behind an Acela. 87 was VERY crowded and spouse and I initially had problems finding seats together. After we wandered through the cafe car a couple of times, spouse carrying our snack box, a cafe attendant took pity on us and asked us if we were looking for a place to sit. We said ""yes"" and she explained that it would be impossible to get a table to ourselves but we could share one with someone else. She then informed a pair at another table that they needed to make room for us. Those two were clearly not traveling together anyway, and the guy announced that he was finished his coffee anyway so he would just go grab a normal seat, while the girl on her laptop remained a quiet tablemate into Philadelphia. 

We had actually been looking for normal seats together, but since there weren't any of those, either, we appreciated the help in at least being able to sit at a table together. 

I had previously decided that NER business class wasn't worth the up charge, but not being able to find seats together had me second guessing myself, so while we ate I submitted a POOR BID to try and get business class on the way back. I could have just upgraded or tried a STRONG BID, but I couldn't bring myself to do anything more than a POOR BID.

The cafe dinner was... okay. Nathan's hot dogs are just fine as hot dogs go, but the microwaved buns get way too hard. We shared a bag of kettle corn that was okay, and a canned cold brew that was actually pretty solid as far as canned cold brews go.

Since I've heard stories of people not getting their tickets scanned and then not getting their points, somewhere after Trenton I approached the table where the conductors and attendants were hanging out and asked them to scan my tickets, explaining that we hadn't been able to find seats together but I didn't want to miss out on my points. The conductor scanned me, gave me the little paper slips that normally go above your seat, and said that two seats together were unlikely then but that we should try again after Philadelphia.

As we approached Philly, we heard them announce that as many people would be getting on as getting off, so we got ready and hung out by the cafe car door, ready to dart across to the coach car and grab some seats as soon as the crowd got off and before the new crowd got on. Our gambit paid off, and we scored those seats at the end that are like ""OOPS! All Leg Room!"" seats (the ones across from the handicap reserved area but are not handicap reserved themselves). At that point we had time for Amtrak selfies. The rest of the ride was pleasant. The view in that section is nothing special but to me all views are better through a train window. We got to Baltimore... I wanna say 2-3 minutes late? It was pretty close to on time. 

Leaving Baltimore Penn was too much of a blurr for me to notice much besides the stained glass (which was actually pretty neat) since we were focused on finding our venue. This was very very easy because it turned out the bar was just right over the bridge from the Penn entrance. The night was grand fun, we had some drinks but also plenty of water, we got some merch (I got a t-shirt and spouse got some socks). We got to see and dance to both the opening acts and a good chunk of the main act before we had to return to the station. 

This was when we had a moment to appreciate that weird statue thing Baltimore Penn has out front. Spouse declared that it looked like something from the Institute (Fallout 4 reference) and demanded I take a pic.

What little shops they have inside Baltimore Penn were closed, but the place had clearly just been cleaned so our timing was good as far as that went. The app said the 128 was eight minutes late, but I think it wound up only being about four or five minutes late. My POOR BID was rejected, but we had no problem finding seats on that later train anyway. The conductor, who was the same one from the 87, recognized us.

Spouse had late night post-show munchies and got a burger. Asked me what I wanted and I said, ""I don't know, just snacky things,"" so spouse got a cheese pack, chips, and chickpea puffs. This was all way too much for me and I split them with spouse. The cheese snack pack was my favorite but the chickpea puffs were better than expected. I asked spouse how the ""Amburger"" was, and spouse was very amused by my pun. I did not admit that I had not actually planned the Amburger/hamburger thing at ALL. At any rate, spouse said the burger was good.

The bathrooms in both directions were okay? Like, not spotless or anything, and there was a bit of toilet paper on the floor going down, but a far cry from some of the horror stories I've heard, especially given how very very crowded the ride down had been. 

Anyway the rest of the ride we just vibed and I watched the lights go by out the window. As we approached Newark, the announcer made it very, very clear that there were only people getting off, not on, and the train would NOT be waiting around, so we lined up, ready to pile out as soon as the doors open. Newark Penn was mostly closed by then, and it was after midnight, so we just caught an Uber and headed home. 

In all, it was an extremely nice and very mundane night out on what may be Amtrak's least glamorous (but definately most heavily used) route. I well very much miss being able to use the train for very ordinary things like this after I move out of the area, and although I know its probably not going to happen in the next few years, I still hold out hope that more of the will eventually be able to have access to this in the future. It may not be High Speed Rail, but its high enough to be useful (and fun), and the more people had access even to mundane little services like the unglamorous little Northeast Regional, the easier it would be to convince them of the value of something like this.

I spent so many years doubting myself, wondering if anyone would ever see me as more.

¬†Then, at 35 years old, something completely unexpected happened. I was at my favorite coffee shop one Saturday morning, fumbling through my purse, trying to find my credit card. As I struggled, I didn‚Äôt notice the man standing behind me. He saw what was happening and, before I could even pull my card out, he stepped up and told the cashier to put my latte on his tab.

¬†Now, I can‚Äôt even explain what it was about the way he said it, but it was like a light switch flipped on in my mind. *Adorable.* No one had ever called me anything like that, certainly not in the genuine way he did.

¬†After I got my coffee, I went to thank him again, which was a big deal for me, and we started talking. When the coffee was done, we took a walk along the waterfront to the park and back. Since then, we‚Äôve been inseparable.

¬†That small moment of kindness of someone seeing me in a way I‚Äôd never seen before, completely changed my life. I feel more beautiful than I ever imagined I would.

------------

Did you know many people try to lose weight but fail? The idea that coffee can help sounds amazing. ""Coffee method weight loss"" is now talked about more. I think it's important to know what it is, how it can help, and if there are any problems. In this article, I will tell you about the coffee method for weight loss. You will learn if it works, what the good things are, and also what problems you can have. I will show you everything.

What is the ""Coffee Method Weight Loss?"" Debunking Myths and Exploring Realities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some people think there is one way to lose weight with coffee. This is not true. Using coffee to help you lose weight is what people mean. The idea is that coffee can help you burn more calories and eat less. But it is not a magic trick. It is important to understand this. Many think just drinking coffee will make them thin. It's more complex than that. It is using coffee to help with other things you do to lose weight, like healthy food and exercise. It is a tool.

The Science Behind Coffee and Weight Loss: How Does It Work?
------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee has caffeine. Caffeine is like a key. It unlocks your body to burn more energy. Your body also makes more heat. This is called thermogenesis. When you drink coffee, you might not feel as hungry. This can help you eat less. Coffee can help, but it is not a miracle. It works by speeding up your body and making you less hungry. More study is needed about it.

Optimizing Your Coffee Consumption for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to use coffee for weight loss, choose black coffee. Black coffee has few calories. Adding sugar and cream adds calories. Calories can make you gain weight. Black coffee is a better choice. The kind of coffee matters. Also, drinking too much coffee is not good. Know how much coffee to drink and when to drink it. Coffee with sugar is bad for health.

The Potential Benefits of Using Coffee for Weight Loss
------------------------------------------------------

Coffee can help you work out better. It gives you more power. You can run faster and lift more weight. When you work out harder, you burn more calories. I find this good. Coffee can give your body a boost. I can play badminton longer. But coffee is only one part. You still need to eat good food and sleep well. Coffee only helps a little.

Potential Risks and Side Effects of Using Coffee for Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee has caffeine. Too much caffeine can make you feel bad. You can feel worried. You might not be able to sleep well. Your stomach can hurt. So, do not drink too much coffee. It is important to be careful. I tell you this because your body is very important. Only a little bit of coffee is okay. Too much will make you sick. I worry about you.

Coffee Interactions with Medications and Health Conditions
----------------------------------------------------------

Coffee can be bad if you take some medicines. It can change how the medicine works. If you have some sicknesses, coffee can make them worse. Heart problems, for example. Ask your doctor before you drink coffee for weight loss. The doctor knows what is good for you. I am an engineer, not a doctor. Your health is most important. Please listen to your doctor.

Is the Coffee Method Weight Loss Right for You? Considerations and Recommendations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think the coffee method is good only if you do other things. Eating good food is important. Exercise helps too. Coffee helps a little. It is like a small push. Think of it like this: Coffee is the spoon, but you must cook the food yourself. You need to work hard. The spoon only helps you eat. I hope you understand. It is important for weight loss.

Conclusion
----------

The coffee method for weight loss is using coffee to help. It is not a magic trick. Coffee can help you burn more calories. It can also make you less hungry. But it is important to be careful. Too much coffee is not good. Talk to a doctor before you start. Remember, coffee is only one part of losing weight. You also need to eat healthy food and exercise. I hope you reach your goals.

Call to Action: Consult a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant changes to your diet or caffeine intake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think that you must see a doctor. Weight loss and using caffeine can be hard. A doctor can make sure it is okay for you. Do this before you start drinking lots of coffee. The doctor will help you lose weight in a safe way. Talking to a doctor is important.

1jbd3qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioUniversities/comments/1jbd3qj/mcmaster_vs_western_political_science_ma/,McMaster vs. Western (Political Science MA),"Hello everyone,

I am considering McMaster vs. Western for an MA in political science. According to university rankings, McMaster is around #5 in Canada and Western is around #10. Certainly reputation matters, as I may choose to apply to another MA or PhD program at a top 20 global school afterwards (Cambridge, Oxford, Stanford, Chicago). But it's also not everything. 

This will be my 4th degree. I have a BA in history and sociology from U of T, a B.Ed from Trent, and an MA in English from Waterloo. I am an Ontario Certified Teacher and I currently teach in the public school system while tutoring advanced placement in the evenings. I mostly want to take a year off from work, study something interesting, meet new people, and open up some future opportunities. I'm looking at teaching high school at IB schools at home and abroad. I really enjoy teaching advanced placement courses in history and social sciences.

I want to choose a school with a good reputation. So I can potentially apply to a top 20 school later on. International recognition also matters for the job market. Such as if I were to apply to work at an IB school or college/university in the US, Europe, Middle East, or Asia.

All Canadian universities are left-leaning, which I don't mind. But it is important to me to be able to speak freely and find courses that are worth the time and effort. At Waterloo, I chose traditional courses in Shakespeare and linguistics, because I felt like I was getting proper value from the material and instruction. In political science, I am more interested in analysis than activism - understanding points of view more than promoting them. I hope this doesn't generate argument, I'm really just giving my point of view, in order to pick the best school for me. Someone else may feel completely different, which is totally fine. We all have different interests and preferences.

The social life also matters. As I mentioned, I am looking to take a year off, and part of that is I've been isolated for quite some time, due to life circumstances. I have heard McMaster is more of a commuter school, while Western is more of a traditional college experience. I don't have an interest in sports or parties, but I do want to have other students around. Lets go get a coffee/drink after class, as opposed to, I have to catch a train. When students live on or close to campus, and there's a city nearby (ex. London), it makes that easier.
