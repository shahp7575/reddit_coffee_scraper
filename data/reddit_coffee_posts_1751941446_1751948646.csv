So I was in mall's men's urinal (I was the only one there) peeing when suddenly out of nowhere a girl barged in. Turns out she was looking at her phone while walking and walked into men's bathroom instead of women's bathroom. She quickly noticed it and barged out very quickly but it was really embrassing for both of us. I decided to do my thing quickly and get out of that place as soon as possible. The moment I stepped out, the girl came to me, she said she was sorry for what she did and told me what really happened. After that she asked me about my whereabouts (about where I was from and which class I am from bla bla bla). She then offered me a cup of coffee, I declined first but she was urging me and said to me to take it as a sorry gift from her. I finnaly agreed (A little cup of coffee won't hurt, right?). We went to a nearby cafe inside the mall and she bought me a cup of coffee. We then chatted for a little while. After I finished the coffee, she paid for the coffee and said to me that she have to go to somewhere. Before going, she asked my insta ID and I gave it to her and after that, she went on her own way.

I would have done more with my car and cleaning but I was so whooped from all the friend and family interactions. I just needed time to dumb my brain down and watch mindless stuff.

SBIST was my cousin complimenting me on being funny. I don't usually take compliments to heart or think about them. I was just cracking jokes randomly saying stupid out of pocket stuff when he just told me how funny he found me. Something about it felt extremely genuine and nice to hear. I know the people he hangs out with and how funny they are. Hearing that come from him about me felt like a nice pat on the shoulder. It felt nice and hearing it from someone I genuinely care the world for felt even better.

Tomorrow the plan is to get a bunch of car cleaning done so I can bring my car to a shop. I want to get the trunk totally cleared out and at least get a nice chunk of the backseat looking fresh. I plan to spend my morning doing that and then maybe head out shopping for a bit before going to the gym. The shopping part depends on a few factors but I wanted to grab ube and look at coolers one more time. If not, then I will live doing this stuff another day. After that I will head to the gym for a good old core exercise. I will head home after that to do some more cleaning of my car and my room. It should be a nice and productive day. Thank you my conjurers of the mini cleaning crews. You're just another name for my fingers when they get busy and motivated.

1luf36s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1luf36s/discipleship_eastern_vs_western_expressions/,Discipleship - Eastern vs Western expressions,"Hi,

**I'd like to reach out to anyone on this sub that might have some experience being discipled by or discipling across very different cultural backgrounds, preferably West to East or West to Middle Eastern.**

I'm currently struggling as an Asian-American, who grew up in the Western expression of the Christian walk (*egalitarian, self-directed learning of Scripture, mentee has more autonomy and input, collaborative*), to be discipled by Korean Christian pastors (*heirarchal, emphasis on obedience and loyalty to leadership, mentee expected to follow leader almost blindly until their ""worth"" is earned*).

I've always been in a situation where leaders would approach me to join their cause whether it's for non-profit organizations, ministry, or even for-profit jobs.  
Growing up, I've always been a liaison between these two cultures and had to do SO much research into dissecting which parts of which culture are truly following God's principles found in Scripture.  
**The thing is, I find both expressions in Scripture in various passages.**

>Jesus lifted up a lot of non-educated, non-male disciples and called all of us to be co-heirs, a bride, as co-workers in bringing God's Kingdom onto earth.  
But there is definitely still order and hierarchy within the church, saying we should work under people as if working for the Lord and not grieve our spiritual leaders for they have responsibility for our soul and will be judged even more harshly.

**STRUGGLE:**  
Recently, I moved to a new area in Korea and found a church that is very solid in preaching, praying, and community. But it's very unique b/c the leadership is Korean without much English knowledge but most of the congregation is international/American without Korean knowledge (close to a base). I can see that they are in desperate need of someone like me who can speak both languages fluently and know both cultures. (P = pastor)

So just after 2-3 days of attending this new church, P has approached me multiple times to ""gauge"" whether I'm willing to serve the church and become P's disciple to do God's work. I've already told P that I'll pray about it while I get to know the congregation -- I had to roundabout say ""be patient, I barely know you and the church"" 3+ times.

Yet still, when P saw me make plans to meet for coffee with some church members, P told disciple/daughter to inject herself into our gathering. Then, P told me that I should always have a leader present until P trusts me. P sees leadership qualities in me, but wants to ""test"" me to see if my heart is in the right place, so I don't ""sway the congregation's hearts and cause division"" which P says has happened in the past.

I personally just want to attend a healthy church and make friends who are believers. I know that P hasn't done this to any other American or even Korean-American congregation member, but P feels super ""grabby"" with me -- only looking at what I can do for the church rather than caring for me as a person. Kinda similar to when men want to marry a woman only for her looks or when women want a man only for his money.

But P says that I will always do circles until I have this breakthrough of discipleship. I know that P's church is not a cult -- however, I am very adamant that I study Scripture on my own and feel the Holy Spirit confirm this before I commit to come ""under P's discipleship."" I also know that I do need guidance and a group of strong believers to discuss and live out the Christian walk. But now I feel like I should avoid this amazing church altogether b/c of this issue. I feel robbed in a way b/c of P's passion which just seems like desparation wrapped up in truth.

This is not an issue that's isolated -- my heart hurts for so many of my fellow Asian Americans who've fallen away from their parents' churches due to cultural differences, even to set up separate churches. Yet, I know that we are called to be united, and fortunately/unfortunately, I seem to always be put into this situation of being called to be the middle person.  
I'm currently still recovering from years of service to ministry, work, and trauma from a similar situation in the States.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Evening from beautiful Puerto Escondido, Mexico. Low season is here Puerto, and I have been kicking it in low gear since I got laid off last week. I’m sleeping in until 7 (my goodness!) and just generally relaxing. Haven’t done jack shit besides walk on the beach, go to the gym, drink coffee and shoot the breeze. Hell – the week I got laid off was my pre-planned vacation week anyways. Haven’t had time off since last November. Also, that job I interviewed for last week? Don’t think it’s in the cards. I assume they informed the candidate today, maybe tomorrow. But it’s all good, I kinda want to chill here and not work for a bit (re: forever).

I wanna touch on a topic similar to our anxiety discussion on Sunday, and that’s emotional stability.
The biggest overall positive change from cutting the poison has been my emotional stability and ability to level-off. The rest of the physical changes are wonderful, but the mental changes have truly saved my life. And when I mean saved my life, I mean put me on the right track.

I don’t get flustered anymore. Being laid off didn’t bother me. I was able to walk away from an emotional volatile situation last weekend without drama from my side, which garnered open respect from others. Flight gets delayed, clients sending negative emails over the littlest details, heck, I love my nephews but sometimes they are too much! But nothing gets to me anymore. I just log it, maybe have a blip and say “ok, let’s adjust.”

My family and longtime friends say I’ve matured, it’s personal growth and all that yadda yadda. Fine, I’ll take the compliments. Flatter me if you want. But I know the reason I’m now in this emotionally mature position is the elimination of the wretched poison. Once that shit hits my bloodstream, it messes with my emotions like a roller coaster. Stability turns out the window, and we go from hot to cold, from happy to angry within minutes.

Best part of becoming emotionally stable: dating has become, dare I say, fun? I no longer have that feeling of worrying neediness, having the poison to mask the authentic me. It’s now “hey, this is me, nothing to hide behind. If you like it cool. If not, no hard feelings.” It’s kinda awesome.

Hope this stream of consciousness makes sense? Low-key burned it too hard in the gym the last week and have been bed-rotting most of the day, only getting up to see a few apartments and to cook a kilo of rib eye, which I started eating at 9AM. Oh, the joys of being unemployed 😊",24,1751947347.0,stopdrinking,37,0.96,False

SBIST was my cousin complimenting me on being funny. I don't usually take compliments to heart or think about them. I was just cracking jokes randomly saying stupid out of pocket stuff when he just told me how funny he found me. Something about it felt extremely genuine and nice to hear. I know the people he hangs out with and how funny they are. Hearing that come from him about me felt like a nice pat on the shoulder. It felt nice and hearing it from someone I genuinely care the world for felt even better.

Tomorrow the plan is to get a bunch of car cleaning done so I can bring my car to a shop. I want to get the trunk totally cleared out and at least get a nice chunk of the backseat looking fresh. I plan to spend my morning doing that and then maybe head out shopping for a bit before going to the gym. The shopping part depends on a few factors but I wanted to grab ube and look at coolers one more time. If not, then I will live doing this stuff another day. After that I will head to the gym for a good old core exercise. I will head home after that to do some more cleaning of my car and my room. It should be a nice and productive day. Thank you my conjurers of the mini cleaning crews. You're just another name for my fingers when they get busy and motivated.

SBIST was being around my family. Everyone was more or less all in one place making it less overwhelming for me. Not everybody is blood but they are the family I made. Every single one had a way to contribute to a conversation that made my life more beautiful. They helped me through different things or helped give me ideas. They built on my life in small but meaningful ways. I had impactful conversations and stuff that I learned that I think will help me in the long run. These people make me feel at home. I may have been overwhelmed yesterday with the different situations but today was perfect.

Tomorrow the plan is to wake up and hang out a bit with my family before heading to the gym. I have back and biceps and a bunch of cardio to get through. After that I plan on going home and working on my car and room. I plan on having another great cleaning session while listening to videos or having a good time with myself. The day will be pretty boring overall but it gives me time to recharge my social battery. I will make the most out of everything for myself. It should be a lovely day. Thank you my conjurers of the blood of the covenant. The family I make through shared experiences is much more important to me than those I was born into.

Hey party people! 🎉 

You ever find yourself scrolling through social media, checking out influencers living their best lives, and think, *“Wow, I’m so glad I’m not them!”*? Seriously though, the influencer grind is REAL, and let’s be honest—it’s a lot of work for not always a lot of payoff, right? But what if I told you there’s a way to cash in without showing your face to the world? 🤔

Let’s dive into this thing! Here are some faceless growth strategies that can help you make money while you focus on what you love—or just binge-watch that new series you’ve been hearing about. You know the struggle!

**1. Automated Content Creation**  
Imagine creating content while you sleep. With AI tools, you can crank out engaging articles, social media posts, or even videos. Think *“I want to work smarter, not harder!”* You can find helpful guides, like [this one](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals), that will show you how to jump on this train!

**2. Niche Websites**  
Got a weird obsession with gardening tools or retro video games? Build a niche site and fill it with high-quality content. Monetizing through affiliate marketing isn’t just for the big dogs anymore. Secure those sales while you’re chilling with your snacks! 🥨

**3. Dropshipping without Meeting Your Customers**  
Start a dropshipping store and let someone else handle fulfillment. You just find cool products, set the prices, and voila! Your online store can run itself while you sip on a frappuccino. 

**4. Print on Demand**  
Design something fun or sarcastic (who doesn’t love a coffee mug that says “Don’t Speak Until My Coffee Is Ready”?) without ever worrying about inventory. Just create, promote, and let the magic happen!

**5. Build Passive Income through E-books or Courses**  
Share what you know! Write an e-book or create a course on something you’re passionate about (just keep the camera off). Once it’s done, it’s like having money rolling in while you’re living your best life!

**Bonus Tip: Networking**  
Okay, so here's the catch—don't be a hermit! Connect with others in your niche. Collaborating or sharing ideas can lead to major opportunities. Plus, it helps beat that feelings of loneliness that come with working behind the scenes.

Now, I know what you’re probably thinking: *“Is it really that easy?”* Well, nothing is without effort, but you know what? You don’t have to be the one in front of the camera! You CAN build something amazing without being an influencer—and it could save us all some sanity. 

Isn’t it time we figured out new ways to monetize our skills and interests? 🤩 Let’s kick that old grind to the curb and embrace the future of anonymous success! What strategies have you tried? Or which ones are you eyeing to jump into? Let’s spark some discussions below!",1,1751947074.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I enjoy people who are kind, genuine and thoughtful. And a willingness to laugh at my stupid jokes.

*Woke up early and headed to the bakery

I talked to the owner for 10 to 15 minutes about my life after I gave her bread pudding. We talked about my life and how much it has changed. I talked about my trip, exercising, and making new friends. She also didn't expect me to be a butcher or where I graduated college. She asked me why I wasn't a baker and the way she said it felt like she wanted me to work for her, especially after clapping for me last week with my cheesecake. She told me about her life and how it changes quite often. We discussed a lot and she told me she loves my little notes describing my goods. She told me everybody loved the cheesecake in the back which made me ecstatic. It was a lovely conversation and I grabbed a Nutella brownie for my friend. 

*Headed to the gym for cardio so I could fit in a workout for the day

Here was my routine:

*Went to work and worked hard during the shortened day

*Coworker upset at me forced door closed at one point to make it harder for me to get out of walk in cooler

*Worked hard and made great tips

*Friend texted me about how my Mom was in a parade which I was not expecting

*Left work and grabbed a coffee before picking up my friend

*Saw family at the coffee shop giving them hugs and kisses and one of them bought me a coffee. Told them I would see them later with my friend 

*Headed to my friend’s house where we went to the park with some gym friends

*My friend wouldn't tell me about if they took card for parking so she forced her friend to take her money to pay for it (kind of sweet actually even if I didn't want her paying)

My friend used to work at the park so she got to see a bunch of her old coworkers. She was the famous one around here and it was fun to see her talking to people. We had no idea where my friends were and got lucky spotting my cousin, long and short haired gym bro, blonde lady, and mustache guy. I also saw my other two first cousins who actually work at the park, which I had no idea of. I had a blast seeing my closer gym friends while at the beach. I hung out with my friend a bunch talking and messing with her. We got utensils for the food where she saw more of her old coworkers who I think I went to high school with. I helped mustache guy cook by mostly confirming the food was safe to eat. I had some food while trying to drive my friend crazy. At one point she made a horrible joke causing me to choke down a third of a sausage my friend grilled. That was an interesting moment

*Headed out to my family's party

*Got to family party and introduced her to everybody 

I could tell she was stressed out with all the people and I was getting stressed out that everybody was so scattered everywhere and I wanted to spend my time with her but she wanted me to be with my family. Everybody was really nice to her and I gave big hugs and kisses to the people I care most about. We went around and she mostly interacted with my cousin's friend but talked to a few other people as well. My cousin's friend got her to say how I drive her nuts and she can't stand me but she keeps saying yes to hanging out. I decided to head out and said goodbye with my cousin's friend putting me on blast and the other defending all as a joke with me backstabbing the person in my defense. That part was even more fun before I headed out. 

*We drove back to her place where she decompressed and played music for us

*We decided I can't call her certain nicknames so I came up with LeapFrog to annoy her

*Got to her house where I hung out with the dog and her little sister and brother before going to play more Baldur's Gate

I had an amazing time with her and her cats playing games. I'm understanding the game more and more, loving it and loving to play it with her, especially. It was a fun night and we had snacks with her showing me her Google Slides of all her celebrity crushes. We played a bunch until I eventually started getting sleepy and she wanted me to get home for work and to sleep. 

*I left for home where I texted her I was safe, my brother let me in, and I decompressed holding my cat who was cuddly for once and talked to my brother

*Ended my night with a smile on my face about my friend and having a great time with her

SBIST was being with my friend and seeing other people I care about with her. Even if it was a bit stressful introducing my friend to people, I was beyond glad that she came with me. I had a blast surrounding my day with people I care about. My goal was to hang out with her. She was my main quest in a sense and all the parties were little side quests. Every quest felt fulfilled and left me feeling happy. Ending my day with her made my day feel complete and happy. Friends like this make a life feel beautiful and easy. 

Tomorrow the plan is to go to work for a bit and then head to the gym right after for my favorite day at the gym. I have a leg's day to destroy and build on. After work since I'm having a two day cheat day, I will get ice cream at my favorite local place. They have two of my favorite flavors currently being teaberry and sweet corn. I can't wait to have them. I then plan on seeing my sister at my cousin's house and allowing to see where the night takes me. It should be a nice day. Thank you my conjurers of the party people.

*Made a couple pit stops before work 

*Tried calling a few people to discuss plans but people were busy

*Went into work and worked my butt off

*Told my coworker about last night who was very excited for me and said she was rooting for me

*Good work day where I worked hard and got tipped really well since I treat customers with respect and have a good time with them

*Talked to mustache guy, blonde lady, guy my cousin knows, short haired gym bro, and front desk

*Talked to blocky dude about friendship and liking people

*Blonde lady believes I should mention my feelings to my friend but to me having her as a friend is infinitely more important

I talked to short haired gym bro who came up to me to check up on me telling me I'm his friend and wanted to make sure I was good.

3 sets of 12 when doing 2 different exercises for abs.

I tried finding names but couldn't. 

First was holding a weight above our head (10 lbs for me) and lifting the offset leg fast. I think something like an offset overhead march. Weight in the other hand was 25 pounds. 

Second was where we held a weight on one side and then swiveled our body inward to get our outer abs. Like a side bend with weight in one hand. 25 pounds in my hand.

We did these one after the other as a set on each side. Rested for 2 minutes and then the next set.

Life is better now and making the most of it around every corner is what I need to continue to do.

SBIST was my friend texting me. I had a really good day but then started overthinking really bad. It was really bad but she listened to me and tried to rationalize things with me. I sometimes get stuck in my head and this morning I kind of just wanted to hear someone's voice. She texted me most of the night and helped to comfort me. Something about her and talking to her is different than other people. I don't know what it is but I'm just comfortable around her and she listens to me. She got me worked down a lot and it's a beautiful feeling to have someone like this in my life. 

Tomorrow the plan is to celebrate the 4th of July. I have work for a few hours and I plan on waking early and going to my favorite bakery and the gym since it closes early. I want to give the owner of the bakery my bread pudding to see her opinion. Work will probably be busy and I should have plenty to do. After work I will be going to pick up my friend to go to a gym friend get together and then to my family's party. It should be a nice day, especially since I'm seeing her.  I'm already excited and can't wait. I'll be having a cheat weekend but keeping myself in check by not overindulging. It should be a nice weekend of activity.

I reached out to you today.. I just knew that we’d slip right back into our little world where it’s just us & our flame that can never seem to burn out. 

It’s exactly what I wanted.. Plans to meet up, grab coffee.. Stare at each other from across the table, there were probably 40 people in that coffee shop but all I could see was you. As we go to say goodbye, it was nice to see you & catch up… We can’t resist driving back to your place to feel that connection & chemistry that neither of us can seem to find anywhere else. We slip right back into each other like we had never drifted apart.

Your response was cold this time though, just a few words & then no response at all.. I guess it really may be time for me to accept that our connection isn’t as special as I thought it was. Maybe it isn’t unbreakable. Maybe it isn’t real & unique huh?

This is something very personal, and very real.

Back in 2019, I went on a solo 3-month backpacking trip across Vietnam and Southeast Asia. It completely changed me. The landscapes were stunning, the culture was rich — but it was the food that really stayed with me. Especially the **Bánh Mì** and that unforgettable **Vietnamese coffee**. I had it almost every day. The flavours were bold, comforting, exciting — all at once. I came back home, but the taste never quite left me.

Fast forward to 2024, my wife Barsha and I went back together for another 2 months. It was a different experience — deeper, more shared, and the food hit us just as hard. We knew we had to bring some of that magic back with us. Not just for us — but for anyone who craved something different, something *real*.

So we built **Yum Mi Bánh Mì** — a small Vietnamese café in Guwahati, Assam. Just the two of us. No fancy investors, no prior experience in the food industry. Just a deep love for what we tasted there, and the fire to create it here.

We serve:

* **Bánh Mì sandwiches**
* **Gỏi Cuốn (Vietnamese spring rolls)**
* **Traditional Vietnamese coffee** — Egg Coffee, Salted Coffee, Bạc Xỉu, and the classic Phin-style strong black coffee.

We bake our own bread. We make our own pickles. We’re still learning every day — there have been burnt loaves, wrong brews, bad proofing days. But every time someone takes a bite and says, “this reminds me of Vietnam” — it’s all worth it.

If you’re in Guwahati, Assam — or just passing through — come by. Try the coffee. Try the bread. Or just drop a kind word. Small businesses like ours live on that kind of love. ❤️

Thanks for reading. If this resonates with even one person, that’s enough for today.

I appreciate all the nice feedback you guys gave me about my game (deciding whether or not to include explicit content). This is such a helpful sub! I have kept to my vision of only PG-13 images and the game continues to grow.

I wanted to share something different with you all. I also am an electronic musician and have been writing music and releasing albums independently for over 10 years. I decided to throw some incidental music into this game and have started uploading tracks. Check it out if you want to hear some interesting incidental music.

Tracks So Far:  
**Define the Relationship Music** \- This track plays when your character's romantic relationship with one of the love interests reaches 85%. It triggers a ""Define the Relationship"" (DTR) moment where you can decide if you want to be official with them or not. The music plays during a sweet dialogue that is unique to each character, showcasing how far the relationship has progressed.

**Coffee Shop Backing** \- This music plays when your character does a social hangout event with any of the characters in the game's coffee shop.

**SOML Intro** \- The name of the game is ""The Soundtrack of My Life"" and follows a struggling musician as he tries to make it in the music industry, improve his skills, perform gigs, and maybe even find love. This track plays at the title screen of the game and can be optionally turned on or off on the game's main UI.

And if you are wondering if I could write some music for your game, the answer is *maybe*. Drop me a DM if you would like to discuss it.",2,1751946826.0,RenPy,0,1.0,False

My parents had no friends, I’m an only child, I had friends in school but nothing that survived into adulthood. I moved around for college and work and now I’m full time WFH as an adult in a rural town. There’s just nowhere and no way to meet people. I go to the local bar and coffee shops sometimes but, besides the fact that everything’s so fucking expensive, it’s a waste of time because no one else is ever there alone or to socialize. Everyone else is there on a date or with friends. It honestly makes me feel worse to go to places like that because then you have to deal with the failure. I have no friends, no partner, no siblings, and no family aside from my parents who are on the opposite side of the country. It’s just me and my dog. I didn’t speak at all today.

*Went to work and worked very hard for the holiday week

*Everything at work went well except my coworker stopped talking to me

Coworker drama is crazy. I called my boss to confirm an order my boss was making confusing and my coworker took it as a sign I didn't trust his information when it was only my boss's info I didn't trust. My coworker decided to not only not talk to me but not even look at me. At one point he looked at the dirt pile I was sweeping and purposely walked through it which is insane. I don't plan on apologizing since he took it upon himself to get upset for no real reason since it wasn't even him I didn't trust at the moment (even if I already didn't trust him). 

*No use getting worked up when the day is good

*Baked bread pudding and made toasted macadamia nut caramel at work 

*Left work for my friend's place

My friend and I hung out for the rest of the night and it was amazing. It's great that I have somebody that feels so easy to be around when I am with her. I can have fun playing with her family's animals or interacting with her little sister or brother or playing a game with her or talking. It just feels nice and it feels insane this friendship came from somebody I associate negative emotions with. Her and I spent the night playing Baldur’s Gate which is freaking amazing. We ate and watched Smosh and I was having so much fun that I kind of fell asleep on her floor until the cat woke me up. I was there past midnight just enjoying myself. Enjoying my friend and enjoying maybe one of the most incredible games I have ever played. I can't wait to see her again. I also gave her the brownie and she questioned why I would buy her something and had her try my bread pudding whi

SBIST was my friend. Everything about her and being around her is beautiful. Of course I can't flat out admit that to her because my friendship with her is more important than any feeling I may possess. I'm happy to have somebody in my life that I look forward to simply messaging every day. Now I made it into somebody to hang out with. I don't believe I have the time in life anymore to wait to hang out with friends or create new relationships. I can put certain feelings away but friendships need to be developed like this because it makes my life better. It makes my life worth living and I'm no longer trying to be in the past. It sometimes comes out and haunts me but the present is where my life is. 

Tomorrow the plan is simple. Wake up and go to work and work hard for the holiday week. I will then hit the gym and maybe see a few friends. After that I have no idea what I will do but I will make the most out of whatever it is. If my sister comes down, then I may just hang with her and family. Either way it just matters how I use the time and make it important to me. Let's make it another good day. Thank you my conjurers of the easy friendships. You make life smoother and all the more beautiful.

Lat extension:
Reps of 10 8 6 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 60 65 and 70 pounds

25 minutes of the stair stepper. I upped how fast it went after 10 minutes from 44 steps per minute to 60. I did it with my backpack.

60 minutes on the treadmill at 3.0 mph with an incline of 8 with my backpack on and a 10 lb weight in my bag. 

Note: Minimal holding onto the front or the rails. 

*Made a couple of stops before work grabbing my friend a surprise brownie

*Went to work and worked very hard for the holiday week

*Everything at work went well except my coworker stopped talking to me

Coworker drama is crazy. I called my boss to confirm an order my boss was making confusing and my coworker took it as a sign I didn't trust his information when it was only my boss's info I didn't trust. My coworker decided to not only not talk to me but not even look at me. At one point he looked at the dirt pile I was sweeping and purposely walked through it which is insane. I don't plan on apologizing since he took it upon himself to get upset for no real reason since it wasn't even him I didn't trust at the moment (even if I already didn't trust him). 

*No use getting worked up when the day is good

*Baked bread pudding and made toasted macadamia nut caramel at work 

*Left work for my friend's place

My friend and I hung out for the rest of the night and it was amazing. It's great that I have somebody that feels so easy to be around when I am with her. I can have fun playing with her family's animals or interacting with her little sister or brother or playing a game with her or talking. It just feels nice and it feels insane this friendship came from somebody I associate negative emotions with. Her and I spent the night playing Baldur’s Gate which is freaking amazing. We ate and watched Smosh and I was having so much fun that I kind of fell asleep on her floor until the cat woke me up. I was there past midnight just enjoying myself. Enjoying my friend and enjoying maybe one of the most incredible games I have ever played. I can't wait to see her again. I also gave her the brownie and she questioned why I would buy her something and had her try my bread pudding whi
ch she gave an 8 out of 10 despite not liking a lot of the ingredients.

SBIST was my friend. Everything about her and being around her is beautiful. Of course I can't flat out admit that to her because my friendship with her is more important than any feeling I may possess. I'm happy to have somebody in my life that I look forward to simply messaging every day. Now I made it into somebody to hang out with. I don't believe I have the time in life anymore to wait to hang out with friends or create new relationships. I can put certain feelings away but friendships need to be developed like this because it makes my life better. It makes my life worth living and I'm no longer trying to be in the past. It sometimes comes out and haunts me but the present is where my life is. 

Tomorrow the plan is simple. Wake up and go to work and work hard for the holiday week. I will then hit the gym and maybe see a few friends. After that I have no idea what I will do but I will make the most out of whatever it is. If my sister comes down, then I may just hang with her and family. Either way it just matters how I use the time and make it important to me. Let's make it another good day. Thank you my conjurers of the easy friendships. You make life smoother and all the more beautiful.

SBIST was my work day. I was working up a storm today feeling graceful and accomplishing so much. Then I not only received one compliment with how I looked but two. Two different customers I know and like told me I looked good and they noticed my weight loss. Hearing it the first time was nice but then when the second person came in and said it, I was more than happy. It feels nice having people notice and is definitely a confidence boost. Then at the end of the day I talked to my boss about how he mentioned a raise at the beginning of the month if he saw improvement. He mentioned fifty cents a month ago. I mentioned to him how I'm working harder and faster. He agreed with me and gave me a one dollar raise which felt pretty good. This day was full of surprises and I felt on top of the world. 

Tomorrow the plan is to wake up early and head to the gym. I want to get my workout done early so I can hang out with my friend in the evening. I will then head to my favorite bakery to drop off some bread pudding. After that will be time for work where I will continue to put my best foot forward. I will end work and head to my friend's house where the plan is to play some Baldur's Gate 3 together and figure out everything after that. It should be a fun night together. I'm already excited.

1lueonb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lueonb/from_what_happened_during_the_summer_part_2/,"From What Happened, During the Summer (Part 2)","She once told me she’d never been anyone’s favorite place.

We were on a call,so late.

I think it was 3:12 a.m. for her.
Her voice was low, not sad exactly

 but distant in that way people get when they're remembering things they don’t say out loud often.

I paused, then said jokingly, “You’re mine.”

She didn’t answer for a while.
I could hear her moving under her blanket, shifting like the words had unsettled something.

Then she whispered with a teasing giggle, “You always know what to say.”

But it wasn’t about knowing.
It was about meaning it.

I didn’t love her the way people usually talk about love.

There were no roses.
No anniversaries.

Just presence.
Just small kindnesses wrapped in ordinary hours.

Like how she’d send voice notes humming her favorite melodies, even when her voice cracked.

Or how she’d ask for mine on days when her anxiety was too loud. 

She once told me my hums felt like someone holding her hand.

That’s what we did.
 We held each other—digitally, emotionally, in all the places that don’t leave physical marks but linger deeper.

We planned a call once where we’d both sit in our windows and just watch the night together.

 I made coffee.

 She had herbal tea.

 We didn’t say much, just pointed out constellations that weren’t really visible and made up stories about the stars.

She said she liked mine better

I said I liked her voice better.

We joked about meeting halfway someday, at some random airport, holding signs with song lyrics instead of names.

Hers would say, “You, you, you’re my safest place” — and mine would say, “I’ll wait in this silence if you’re in it too.”

I never told her, but I wrote those lines down. I kept them.

Every part of that summer felt stitched together with golden thread.

 Not because it was perfect—but because it was real. 

Messy and quiet and deeply human.

We didn't talk about the future often, but once, just once

she said, “If this lasts, I think I’d want to read books next to you in silence. 

You know? Not needing to fill it. Just… being.”

And I told her, “That’s the kind of forever I want.”
She smiled.

I heard it in her breath before I saw it in the grainy camera feed.

That was the thing—she never said much in return. But she stayed. That was enough.

 For me, her presence was the loudest kind of affection.

There was a night, not long after, where we fell asleep on call again. 

I remember staring at the ceiling in the dark, her soft breathing in my ear, thinking, If nothing else happens… this would be enough.

Because not all love needs a future to be meaningful.

Sometimes, it’s enough to exist in a moment where both of you feel safe enough to just be.

And in that moment, with her asleep on the other end, I was happy.

*Woke up and gathered some things

*Laid down and did a bit of thinking 

*Headed to the gym early in case friend wanted to hang out today

Here was my routine: 

60 minutes on the treadmill at 3.0 mph with an incline of 8 with my backpack on and a 10 lb weight in my bag. 

Note: Minimal holding onto the front or the rails. 

5 minutes of stretching 

4 sets of 10 push ups

95 second plank

4 sets of 160 of heel taps 

4 sets of 24 of reverse crunches

4 sets of 24 of leg lowers

4 sets of 32 of dead bugs

4 sets of 32 of Russian twists

3 sets of 12 when doing 2 different exercises for abs.

I tried finding names but couldn't. 

First was holding a weight above our head (10 lbs for me) and lifting the offset leg fast. I think something like an offset overhead march. Weight in the other hand was 25 pounds. 

Second was where we held a weight on one side and then swiveled our body inward to get our outer abs. Like a side bend with weight in one hand. 25 pounds in my hand.

We did these one after the other as a set on each side. Rested for 2 minutes and then the next set. 

Assisted ab crunch machine:
Reps of 12 10 8 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 80 85 and 90 pounds

Torso rotation:
Reps of 12 10 8 with weight increasing by 10 each time to be 150 155 and 160 pounds

Note: Both sides rotated. 

Captains chair:
Set 1: 7 crunches and 7 hanging leg raises
Set 2: 7 crunches and 7 hanging leg raises

90 minutes on the treadmill at 3.0 mph with an incline of 8 with my backpack on and a 10 lb weight in my bag. 

Note: Minimal holding onto the front or the rails. 

*Went shopping for important stuff, food, and baking materials

*Hit a few shops and looked at cooler at an outdoors store thinking on how to store my different creations

*Went home and rested for a bit

*Started cleaning

*Cleaned my car for about 90 minutes getting a bunch of progress done

*Completed laundry

*Organized cans

*Cleaned and organized fridge 

*Sadly threw out chocolate milk after one day and emailed them about why it went bad in a matter of hours

*Took out trash

*Cooked off broccoli and made dinner

*Talked to brother about weekend

Overall today felt very fruitful. My friend didn't want to stress her mom out so we postponed hanging out. This didn't mean I didn't get stuff done. I actually got loads done and felt awesome about it. Getting so much cleaning felt extraordinary. Then during all this she actually asked me to come over tomorrow but remembered I go to the gym late. I told her I could go to the gym in the morning but she wanted me to get enough sleep so she moved it to the day after. It would also give us brainstorming time for what to do. I already can't wait and felt excited she invited me over. Friendship time is the best time. I just feel comfortable around her and it's nice. Today felt like a great step forward with cleaning and I ended it with a smile.

SBIST was the amount of cleaning I got done in general. I cleaned my car, the fridge, and various different things tidying up what I could. It felt awesome to get so much cleaned up and I felt very proud of myself. I kind of just locked in doing whatever I could and it felt great to do so. I got things moved around and looking good for once. Nothing is perfect yet but it is quite the start to getting there. My car being very clean is where I'm most excited and I can't wait until it is back to normal. It is a good feeling to see things around me getting cleaner and cleaner. 

Tomorrow the plan is to wake up early and get caught on a couple things including writing. I will then head into work and work as hard as I can. After that I will be heading to the gym for my favorite day of legs. I will then go home and get some stuff done before heading to bed early. My friend and I will be hanging out the following day so I will hit the gym early so I can see her. It should be another good day. Thank you my conjurers of the cleaned areas.

60 minutes on the treadmill at 3.0 mph with an incline of 8 with my backpack on and a 10 lb weight in my bag. 

Note: Minimal holding onto the front or the rails. 

5 minutes of stretching 

4 sets of 10 push ups

95 second plank

4 sets of 160 of heel taps 

4 sets of 24 of reverse crunches

4 sets of 24 of leg lowers

4 sets of 32 of dead bugs

4 sets of 32 of Russian twists

3 sets of 12 when doing 2 different exercises for abs.

I tried finding names but couldn't. 

First was holding a weight above our head (10 lbs for me) and lifting the offset leg fast. I think something like an offset overhead march. Weight in the other hand was 25 pounds. 

Second was where we held a weight on one side and then swiveled our body inward to get our outer abs. Like a side bend with weight in one hand. 25 pounds in my hand.

We did these one after the other as a set on each side. Rested for 2 minutes and then the next set. 

Assisted ab crunch machine:
Reps of 12 10 8 with weight increasing by 5 each time to be 80 85 and 90 pounds

Torso rotation:
Reps of 12 10 8 with weight increasing by 10 each time to be 150 155 and 160 pounds

Note: Both sides rotated. 

Captains chair:
Set 1: 7 crunches and 7 hanging leg raises
Set 2: 7 crunches and 7 hanging leg raises
Set 3: 7 crunches and 7 hanging leg raises

25 minutes of the stair stepper. I upped how fast it went after 10 minutes from 44 steps per minute to 60. I did it with my backpack on. 

90 minutes on the treadmill at 3.0 mph with an incline of 8 with my backpack on and a 10 lb weight in my bag. 

Note: Minimal holding onto the front or the rails. 

*Went shopping for important stuff, food, and baking materials

*Hit a few shops and looked at cooler at an outdoors store thinking on how to store my different creations

*Went home and rested for a bit

*Started cleaning

*Cleaned my car for about 90 minutes getting a bunch of progress done

*Completed laundry

*Organized cans

*Cleaned and organized fridge 

*Sadly threw out chocolate milk after one day and emailed them about why it went bad in a matter of hours

*Took out trash

*Cooked off broccoli and made dinner

*Talked to brother about weekend

Overall today felt very fruitful. My friend didn't want to stress her mom out so we postponed hanging out. This didn't mean I didn't get stuff done. I actually got loads done and felt awesome about it. Getting so much cleaning felt extraordinary. Then during all this she actually asked me to come over tomorrow but remembered I go to the gym late. I told her I could go to the gym in the morning but she wanted me to get enough sleep so she moved it to the day after. It would also give us brainstorming time for what to do. I already can't wait and felt excited she invited me over. Friendship time is the best time. I just feel comfortable around her and it's nice. Today felt like a great step forward with cleaning and I ended it with a smile.

Here is what I ate today:

SBIST was the amount of cleaning I got done in general. I cleaned my car, the fridge, and various different things tidying up what I could. It felt awesome to get so much cleaned up and I felt very proud of myself. I kind of just locked in doing whatever I could and it felt great to do so. I got things moved around and looking good for once. Nothing is perfect yet but it is quite the start to getting there. My car being very clean is where I'm most excited and I can't wait until it is back to normal. It is a good feeling to see things around me getting cleaner and cleaner. 

Tomorrow the plan is to wake up early and get caught on a couple things including writing. I will then head into work and work as hard as I can. After that I will be heading to the gym for my favorite day of legs. I will then go home and get some stuff done before heading to bed early. My friend and I will be hanging out the following day so I will hit the gym early so I can see her. It should be another good day. Thank you my conjurers of the cleaned areas. You make me feel like there is hope for me yet.

Oslo > Stavanger > Bergen > Flam > Trondheim > Oslo

7/12 - 7/13 - Oslo

7/14 - 15 Stavanger

7/16 - 17 Bergen

7/18 - we booked the Flam railway on this day and plan to stay near Flam for the night.

7/19 to 7/24 is unplanned but we were thinking of making our way to Trondheim and then returning to Oslo on 7/23.

We have a few questions and while we have accommodations booked through our stay in Bergen (until 7/18), does this general route make sense? Is Trondheim worth visiting or would the time be better spent without making the trek out to Trondheim and focusing on the remaining cities/areas/natural sites & parks?

I've always wanted a simple tool to quickly stitch screenshots together or make a nice photo collage without having to download an app, create an account, or deal with ugly watermarks on the final image.

So, over the last couple of weeks, I built one! I'd love for you to check it out and tell me what you think.

**Link:** [https://img.ops-coffee.cn/en/](https://img.ops-coffee.cn/en/)

https://preview.redd.it/d52ujltnlkbf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=515bf1582cfb2e6fc283ab1fa0fab2800ded27b4

My goal was to make it fast, free, and private. Here are the key principles:

* **100% Free & No Watermarks.** Seriously. No hidden costs, no premium features. Just a useful tool.
* **Privacy First.** No login required, and all your images are processed directly in your browser. Nothing is ever uploaded to my servers.
* **Powerful Features.** It's not just a basic tool. We packed in a lot of functionality:

Here’s a quick rundown of what it can do:

* **Two Main Modes:**
   * **Layout Collage:** Choose from dozens of predefined layouts for your photos.
   * **Long Image Stitching:** Easily stitch multiple screenshots or images together, either vertically or horizontally.
* **Full Canvas Control:** On top of your collage, you can add and edit:
   * **Text**
   * **Arrows**
   * **Squares & Circles**
   * ...and drag, resize, or rotate any of them.
* **Pro-level Customization:**
   * Adjust spacing, corner radius, and border sizes.
   * Set a custom background color or even a background image.
   * **Choose your download quality!** Export as a High/Standard JPG to save space, or as a Lossless PNG for maximum quality.
* **Modern Web Tech:** It's a fully-fledged PWA, so you can ""install"" it to your desktop/homescreen for quick access and it even works offline. It also supports 11 languages!

This has been a passion project, and I'm really looking to make it better. I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback you have. What do you like? What's confusing? What feature should I build next?

They said I’d quit in a week.  
Some even joked I was “just doing it for Instagram.”

But what they didn’t see…  
Was me staring at the mirror feeling broken.  
Me trying to hold back tears because nothing fit.  
Me Googling “how to stop binge eating at night.”

# 💔 Everyone Had an Opinion — But I Had a Reason

I didn’t start keto to be trendy.  
I started because I was tired of:

* Feeling bloated all the time
* Constantly craving sugar
* Watching my weight go up and my confidence disappear
* Being trapped in a cycle of “start Monday, quit by Wednesday”

# 🥓 So I Went Quiet — and Started Small

I didn’t argue. I didn’t post about it.  
I just made one decision: *change my plate.*

**Breakfast:**  
→ Scrambled eggs + spinach + black coffee  
**Lunch:**  
→ Grilled chicken + roasted veggies with olive oil  
**Dinner:**  
→ Cauliflower rice stir-fry with paneer or tofu  
**Snacks:**  
→ Boiled eggs, nuts, cucumber slices, cheese cubes

No cheat meals. No explanations. Just **consistency**.

# 🔥 Week by Week, the Results Spoke Louder Than Opinions

* 1kg down… silence
* 3kg down… side-eyes
* 6kg down… “What are you doing again?”
* 10kg down… “Can you send me your plan?”

I didn’t *prove them wrong*. I proved **myself right**.

# 💪 Keto Isn’t a Fad. It’s a Foundation.

The truth? Most people are afraid of what they don’t understand.  
But if it’s working for you — let them laugh.

You’ll be the one glowing, focused, and strong — inside and out.

The thing is—she shows up and melts my heart like clockwork, maybe once or twice a month. I work at a coffee shop, and every time she comes in, it’s like she’s completely tuned into me. The way she looks at me feels like I’m her long-lost lover from a past life. She’s so sweet, asks thoughtful questions, her body language is so flirty… and I definitely flirt back BIG TIME. Lots of deep eye contact (she is a pisces venus)

I’m a playful Sag Mars, so I like the chase.  Slow burn rom com is my thing. So I’ve never outright told her what I want from her, but I’ve definitely dropped hints. We’re the same gender, so I sometimes wonder if she’s unsure or questioning whether I’m actually into her. I always compliment her—tell her she’s beautiful, joke about I would die if she ever give me a kiss. I even made her a handmade paper flower bouquet once, and she seemed to love it. Lots of physical touches and she seems to love it!

But here’s the frustrating part: she’s so flat over text. Never texts me first. Every time I subtly try to initiate plans, she just… ignores it. Like, what the hell? Are we flirting or not? Where do I go from this? 

I get that she’s super busy (so am I), and I’m not asking for constant attention. But if I’m going to keep pursuing her, I need some kind of reciprocation. Right now it just feels like emotional whiplash.

Has anyone dealt with something like this—especially with Aries women? Is she confused, uninterested, or just vibing in her own world? Do I still have a chance? ",1,1751945508.0,AriesTheRam,6,1.0,False
1lueheu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Substantial_Bake_950/comments/1lueheu/from_what_happened_during_the_summer_part_2/,"From What Happened, During the Summer (Part 2)","She once told me she’d never been anyone’s favorite place.

We were on a call, late. I think it was 3:12 a.m. for her. Her voice was low, not sad exactly, but distant in that way people get when they're remembering things they don’t say out loud often.

I paused, then said jokingly, “You’re mine.”

She didn’t answer for a while.

 I could hear her moving under her blanket, shifting like the words had unsettled something.

Then she whispered with a teasing giggle, “You always know what to say.”

But it wasn’t about knowing. 
It was about meaning it.

I didn’t love her the way people usually talk about love.

There were no roses. 

No anniversaries.

Just presence.
Just small kindnesses wrapped in ordinary hours.

Like how she’d send voice notes humming her favorite melodies, even when her voice cracked.

 Or how she’d ask for mine on days when her anxiety was too loud. 

She once told me my hums felt like someone holding her hand.

That’s what we did.

We held each other—digitally, emotionally

In all the places that don’t leave physical marks but linger deeper.

We planned a call once where we’d both sit in our windows and just watch the night together.

 I made coffee.

She had herbal tea.

 We didn’t say much, just pointed out constellations that weren’t really visible and made up stories about the stars.

She said she liked mine better.

I said I liked her voice better.

We joked about meeting halfway someday, at some random airport, holding signs with song lyrics instead of names.

Hers would say, “You, you, you’re my safest place” — and mine would say, “I’ll wait in this silence if you’re in it too.”

I never told her, but I wrote those lines down. I kept them.

Every part of that summer felt stitched together with golden thread.

Not because it was perfect—but because it was real. 

Messy and quiet and deeply human.

We didn't talk about the future often, but once, just once

she said, “If this lasts, I think I’d want to read books next to you in silence. 

You know? Not needing to fill it. Just… being.”

And I told her, “That’s the kind of forever I want.”
She smiled.

 I heard it in her breath before I saw it in the grainy camera feed.

That was the thing—she never said much in return. But she stayed. That was enough.

For me, her presence was the loudest kind of affection.

There was a night, not long after, where we fell asleep on call again. 

I remember staring at the ceiling in the dark, her soft breathing in my ear, thinking, If nothing else happens… this would be enough.

Because not all love needs a future to be meaningful.

Sometimes, it’s enough to exist in a moment where both of you feel safe enough to just be.

And in that moment, with her asleep on the other end, I was happy.

While it started with hope and connection, I now find myself emotionally drained, unappreciated, and unsure of where I stand. The imbalance has become increasingly clear — especially during a recent trip to Chicago that I planned and paid for entirely.

I spent over $500 on the trip, covering the rental car, gas, accommodations, food, and more. I didn’t expect her to split the cost 50/50, but I had hoped she would show appreciation in some form — maybe a coffee, a small gift, or just a genuine “thank you.” Instead, she didn’t offer to pay for anything, not even a cocktail. When she bought souvenirs at the museum gift shop, she didn’t think to get me anything — her explanation being that I wouldn’t have liked it. That may have been true, but it reflected a broader theme: she doesn’t really see me.

Throughout the trip, I carried the emotional and logistical weight. She had what she called an “autistic meltdown,” which left me to calm her down, find food options, and guide us back to the car — all while managing my own stress. Later, she got upset that I hadn’t made a dinner reservation, questioning my leadership. When I asked her on the drive back why she had considered breaking up with me previously, she said I made her feel “unseen” during Step 1 studying — even though I had communicated clearly that I’d be busy and still stayed in contact daily. Her reason felt like it shifted blame onto me, without acknowledging the support I *was* giving.

Back home, she didn’t text or call after the trip. Not once. After everything I put into that weekend, the silence felt like a slap in the face. I decided not to reach out first — not to play the emotional laborer once again. If she cared, she’d show up. But she hasn’t.

This trip didn’t just expose cracks in our relationship — it confirmed patterns I had tried to ignore. Her unwillingness to give, her changing stories, her emotional inconsistencies, and her tendency to center herself in every situation have left me feeling used and unimportant. From hygiene to intimacy to values, we’ve drifted further apart.

I’ve realized that love, respect, and support should go both ways. I’ve been patient, even generous. But I can’t keep pouring into someone who doesn’t pour back. The Chicago trip was supposed to be a moment to enjoy each other — instead, it became the final sign that I’ve been carrying too much on my own.

It’s clear now: I need a partner who sees me, values me, and meets me halfway. And sadly, that’s not this relationship.",20,1751945362.0,GuyCry,5,1.0,False

1luee0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawyerAdvice/comments/1luee0f/i_was_depressed_not_dangerous_i_lost_my_daughter/,I was depressed not dangerous i lost my daughter,"I’ve been carrying this story in silence for almost two years because it hurts more than I can explain. But I’m done being quiet. Maybe someone out there will hear me.

I live in Québec. During COVID, I had a baby, my daughter. I was in full postpartum depression, completely isolated, and overwhelmed it was during peak quarantine... couldn't find no help no nothing everyone were either closed or not taking new clients. I reached out for help thinking DPJ would support me. That was my first mistake. I was honest in a moment of despair, crying and saying “I’m tired... maybe I should put her up for adoption.” I never meant it literally. I was just exhausted and broken.

But from that moment, it was like I triggered a chain reaction I couldn’t stop. Suddenly I was in non-stop meetings with adoption workers, people treating me like I'd already made up my mind, even though I was crying in every single meeting, saying I didn't want this.

They never told me I had a right to a lawyer. They never offered me real help to stay with my daughter. They just kept moving forward like my words didn't matter.

The only paper I ever signed was a temporary placement in foster care for one year, not adoption. I even started improving. I got a job as a dental secretary, found an apartment, a car, stability, but it was never enough for them.

They made me do two psychological evaluations , both chosen and paid by DPJ. The first one was in my favor and said I was a good mom, just struggling with depression. DPJ didn’t like that one, so they had me evaluated again by someone else. The second one suddenly labeled me “manic depressive” even though I was doing better by then , and that was the nail in the coffin.

The foster family was two white men,a gay couple (i have absolutely nothing against that)  and at first, they promised it would be an open adoption. They said things like:

“You can bring her to school some mornings.” “When she’s 16, we’ll take her for coffee dates with you.” “We’d love for her to stay connected to her mom.” I held onto those promises like air. But the second the adoption was official, they ghosted me. No more visits. No more updates. Nothing.

They even failed to notify me of the court date where the adoption was finalized. They sent the hearing notice to my old address, even though they sent the final adoption letter to my parents address, so clearly they knew where I was. They just didn’t want me there.

I never got to fight for her. I never got to tell a judge my story. I was erased.

She’s going to be 5 years old this October 10th. I haven’t seen her in over a year. On paper, I’m no longer her mom, but in my heart, I always will be.

I have videos of the foster parents interfering during visits. I have footage of a social worker pressuring me to admit things I didn’t do (like hitting my child, I never did). I have a timeline of everything that happened. But two lawyers told me there's ""nothing I can do"" because she was adopted so young.

Meanwhile, I’ve seen parents on drugs still allowed to see their kids every weekend. But me, sober, stable, and emotional during postpartum, was treated like a monster. How is that fair?

I’m terrified to hope again. Every time I think I’ve found a way, I hit another wall. But I’m writing this here because maybe someone out there knows what I can do. Or maybe someone went through something like this and just… gets it.

I want to believe there’s still a chance. Even if it's just to be in her life again. Even if it's just for her to know that I never gave her up.

I just want to see her again...at least one time.. because last time i saw her i didn't even knew it was going to be the last... I'm grieving a child that's alive and that's the most fucked up thing I've ever been thru...",1,1751945190.0,LawyerAdvice,1,1.0,False

1luec9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1luec9o/from_what_happened_during_the_summer/,"From What Happened, During the Summer","

It started with a letter.

I didn’t know what else to do with the feelings that had quietly built up in me

so I wrote them down.
No grand gesture. 
Just a simple message typed with hesitant fingers and a hopeful heart.

""Hi, I don’t know where to begin, but I think you’re someone worth knowing. I think I already admire the way you carry sadness like poetry. And I just wanted to say... if this goes nowhere, I’m still glad I found your words.""

I didn’t expect her to reply. But she did.

That’s how it began.

We met online.
No fireworks, no drama. Just an honest connection in a time when most people scroll past each other without a second glance. 

She commented on something I posted—a soft response to something vulnerable. 

There was honesty in her reply. Raw and unfiltered.

Our conversations were casual at first. 

Just little things. Music. Books. Quiet admissions of favorite smells and fears that lingered from childhood.

 Day by day, the walls between us lowered. What began as convenience turned into necessity. 

Not in a possessive way, but like coffee in the morning—warm, grounding, expected.

She’d tell me about her day in voice notes—soft, sleepy narrations that made me pause whatever I was doing just to listen.

 I started waiting for them.

She had this way of making even the most mundane moments feel like stardust.

Like hearing about her walk home or the way her dog barked at a butterfly was a privilege.

We shared songs. Every night.

She'd ask me to sing sometimes, and I did, softly.

Even when I was nervous.
Even when my voice cracked.

Because she said it made her feel safe. And in return, I felt seen. Like my voice mattered. Like I mattered.

We had inside jokes.
Things no one else would understand.

I still remember the night she said, ""If I ever disappear, will you write me a story where I stay?"" I said, ""I already am.""

You have tried to kiss me on multiple occasions while you were feeling the alcohol and I said no. I said no, but really I want to grab you up and make out with you forever. You're the only person right now that I know in my life, who I WANT to say yes to. So bad.

I'm going yo assume it's a pretty handy thing to have, as I have already started dabbling in N scale (1950s Australian prototype). But since I have it, why not do something Japanese? 

Im not really interested in fast passenger trains more freight, and working the trains. So this is my opportunity to focus on a run around without trying to fit shunting in everywhere.

When he moved out he left his TV stand, which is a 1210 by 600mm coffee table. So I'm going to use that. 

My limited N scale track is Peco, and preferably want to keep that for wherever I go with my Australian layout (one day).

The logical step was to by some Kato or a Kato kit and start from there. But now Im seeing all this Tomix is better stuff. So RIP. Where do I go? Is there a good starter kit anyone suggests.

Im really wanting a a basic loop, side by side track. That can deviate (i.e one goes high and ones goes low for a section). I do want to incorporate height to allowing whizzing through the top half of buildings around the city. My other layouts are all about country trains and carrying cargo across Australian towns with fuck all in them and mostly passing paddocks. So this is my time to model more city - except I don't want to actually do a lot of the modelling. If you get my gist 😅 but I also do like those Japenese garden themes and farms.

How to explain mental load to my husband? We had our first four months ago and he’s been an incredible father but lately as a partner the mental load (& maybe physical load) has been a lot on me. I’ve gone back to work full time, I’m pumping there & breastfeeding at home… Here’s an example of an evening after work / the situation tonight.

Me: stop at grocery store on way home to grab stuff for dinner, start a load of laundry, empty dishwasher, change our bedding, fold load of laundry, wash/prep food to be cooked, breastfeed, clean pump parts, run bottle sterilizer, breastfeed again &  get baby to sleep, fill humidifier, wash bottles from today, prep bottles for tomorrow, wash some dishes, prep coffee pot for AM.

Husband: pick baby up at daycare, plays game on his laptop while baby naps next to him for ~75min minutes, stir fry the food I prepped while I breastfeed baby, carry up load of laundry (that I asked him to do), change diaper & get baby in PJs (that I asked him to do), play more computer games for another 2+ hours, will (allegedly) finish washing dishes before he comes up to bed (because I asked him to).

It’s EXHAUSTING. He does things when I ask but I don’t want to have to ask him and delegate things to him… also i don’t know how to approach him doing more around the house because then he’ll deflect and say i don’t appreciate other things he does (eg occasional yard work on a weekend which i always go out of my way to thank him for and I feel like everything i do on a daily basis is expected) or he will say that he just “likes to relax after work” or say “oh what are we keeping score now?” 

He also stays up late on his phone or playing video games and then has the audacity to complain to me about being tired when im still breastfeeding overnight usually 2x a night….

What do i do? The petty part of me wants to just stop doing everything I do until he realizes (but then I have to live in dirty chaos and having the coffee set on a timer is my one thing I look forward to after a long night) & I’m worried that I’m so frustrated I’ll get upset / cry when I approach the situation in which he will probably say something about it just being my post partum hormones (which I’m sure isn’t helping the situation).

1lue1mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1lue1mh/we_love_tekken_more_than_the_devs_and_its_just_sad/,We Love Tekken More Than The Devs and It’s Just Sad,"TLDR

It’s been over a year and a half. We’ve heard every excuse in the book. They promised us a big balance patch but this patch is 80% bug fixes. If you enjoy the game, by all means. But this is just sad.

The arcade release excuse was never valid. Why would you in your right mind, in 2024, release the game in arcades when people will tell you arcades are dead. They could’ve developed a new way to collect feedback rather than “just tweet at us” and then blocking us anyway. They never gave a fuck about our feedback from the start.

They don’t give a shit about the pros. Not a single pro is saying that we need to wait for the tournaments, they want more nerfs NOW. They don’t take the pros feedback in mind, or anyone else’s for that matter. They don’t have any respect for anyone playing the game.

This game is literally a cash grab, and I would even go as far as to say this is a scam. It’s a cash grab because we already know the Genmaji Temple situation, waiting for positive reviews and then launching battle pass, stages not being included in season passes, charging for legacy outfits, upcharging us for unwanted coins to purchase items, etc. How many times do we have to say it? 

But I’d go as far as to say this game is a scam because of the lying. They block you from reviewing the game on PlayStation. We were blatantly lied to when it came to the S2 update 3 months ago. We were now lied to again, this is not a balance patch. There were some good things in this patch, yes. But the obvious problems are still there and they’ve changed maybe 5%. I think if a lot of us knew that Tekken 8 would end up like this, we wouldn’t have even bought the game in the first place. If you don’t believe me, go look at the Steam charts going down since Jan (April is the only exception because we tried S2). The team is purposefully lying to us and keeping us on a string. It’s been a year and a half, let’s call it what it is.

The game has no passion or integrity. This game is literally a platform for other games or movies or whatever other bullshit. They really gave us a single strand of hair as “customization”. Meanwhile, the other game gets to dress up as Reina. Reina is literally wearing the other girl’s outfit in the fan art but we get a fucking strand of hair as customization. They promote Karate Kid with a shitty low res jpeg of the promo poster on bland ass clothing. They put the ads of the new collaboration all over the stage. Buy your Angel Clover watch, watch Karate Kid, play the anime game, here’s some obnoxious Pac-Man stage, here’s another Final Fantasy guest character because we know how much you hated the first one, buy our merch, buy the new figures, just buy buy buy and don’t think at all and be our mindless drone that we can string along and milk for money.

Their marketing is even shit. They add another generic dancing waifu with no personality into the game and her only voice lines are about coffee and then…they put Leroy’s face on the coffee stuff or whatever bullshit that was. They have a Tekken Talk where they literally don’t talk about anything substantial on purpose and they KNEW that. Nakatsu and Harada go off and hide and they leave Murray to the wolves lmfao. We get to see more of Murray gameplay than we do Fahkumram during the Bandai showcase. 

The worst part of this game is obviously the gameplay. Gameplay will always be more important than graphics, or stupid microtransactions, or annoying developers, or whatever. They don’t even understand their own game or audience. They keep putting stuff we don’t want in the game. They ruined Anna. They put Clive and we hate him. They removed homing throws just to try to sprinkle them back in. We say please less heat, they add more. No more installs, they put more. Too much unfair frames, they put more. Too much tracking, they add tracking. Too much stance mix up and 50/50, so they add more. Combos are too long, now we have multiple tail spins. They remove execution, even though that was the whole point of having special style. They remove ki charge, which nobody wanted. We ask for a new way to lab CH, they don’t give a shit. We ask for less effects, they give us the PAC man stage. We don’t like guard break, they give it to more characters in T8. We don’t like unbreakable throws, they add it back into the game.

This is all intentional. They literally said at the end of this patch that they will have MINOR balance updates in the future, so this direction is intentional. How many times are we going to say “oh a step in the right direction” and continue getting shit on? They had no problem making major changes to make the game worse. They never have a problem making the changes they want but when we ask for a change, it’s always some excuse. Why can’t they revert combo length so you only get one tail spins? Why can’t they revert the oki? Why can’t they revert heat smash to once per round? Why can’t they bring back ki charge? There’s no real reason besides their petty stupidity of “we don’t want to and we’ll do the changes we think are best”.

This IP is special, it’s more than just a game. Or rather, it was. A lot of us dedicated players and die hard fans think of the game of something like a sport, kind of like chess. We have a lot of special memories of it and blah blah blah you get the point. But about the people who say it’s just a game, I don’t feel like that’s a good counter argument and I don’t think they fully understand, but unfortunately they’re right. Tekken 8 is not a sport, it’s hardly even Tekken. Let’s call it like it is. Tekken 8 is a bad game developed by a bad studio that isn’t doing well and is just trying to stay afloat by milking the reputation of some of their classics. The goal of this game was never new players, legacy players, continuing the franchise in a meaningful way, esports, or even fun. It is a cash grab. I truly believe it’s all about the money. Go watch the Tekken Talk and 90% of it is just trying to sell you stuff.

***For added context because I know some uninformed idiot is going to say it, yes Bamco is a huge company but their in house studio isn’t doing well. Go look it up. Most of the games they work on are not published in house. As you can see, for good reason.

1ludzpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1ludzpf/im_a_mailman_at_a_post_office_in_rural/,I'm a Mailman at a Post Office in Rural Alabama...There are STRANGE RULES to follow !,"**Have you ever been handed a piece of paper that felt heavier than lead—like it carried the weight of your own doom? Or been told to follow rules so bizarre, so downright bone-chilling, that you started questioning whether you were awake or trapped in some fevered nightmare?** I have. And I swear on everything I hold dear, I wish I never had.

My name’s Tommy Reed. A plain, forgettable man in a plain, forgettable life. Thirty-eight years on this earth, and nothing much to show for it except a mailman’s uniform, a pair of scuffed boots, and the silence that comes from being single in a small town. No kids. No wife. No wild stories to tell—**or at least, not until that night.** See, I work the graveyard shift at a creaky little post office in Mill Creek, Alabama. A place so small, even the stray dogs know everyone’s business. Population hovers at two thousand—on a good day, if you count the drifters and the dearly departed resting up on the hill. It’s the kind of town where nothing happens. At least, nothing that folks are willing to talk about.

But let me tell you—**there was one night. One night that cracked open the quiet like a coffin lid. The night I learned the rules weren’t just some oddball tradition. They were a lifeline. A set of commandments carved out to keep death—and worse—at bay.**

It all began at exactly 10:03 PM on a Thursday evening that smelled of rain and regret. I remember the time clear as day, because I was punching in at the old brass clock on the wall, the one that ticks too loud in the silence. That’s when Marvin—old Marvin, who’d manned that shift longer than I’ve been alive—handed me an envelope so yellowed and brittle it looked like it might crumble to dust right there in my hand. His face? I’ll never forget it. Pale as chalk. Eyes hollow, like he’d already seen what was coming for me.

“You sure you wanna take over the night shift, son?” His voice cracked like dry timber.

I tried to muster a smile, though my gut twisted up like barbed wire. “Yeah,” I said, forcing the words out. “I like the quiet.”

But Marvin didn’t smile back. Not even a flicker of one. Instead, with hands that trembled just enough for me to notice, he pressed the envelope into my palm. “Then you’d best read this. Every last word. And don’t you dare cut corners, boy. Not a single one.”

The envelope felt cold, somehow, like it had been waiting in a grave. I opened it, heart thudding in my chest like a drum at a funeral. Inside was a single sheet of paper, yellowed and cracked at the edges. The list was typed in all caps, the ink faded but legible. And what it said… well, it read more like a survival manual than anything to do with mail.

**RULES FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT — MILL CREEK POSTAL STATION**

1. Clock in exactly at 10:03 PM. Not a minute earlier. Not a minute later.  
2. Lock the front door behind you. Check it twice.  
3. At 11:11 PM, place a glass of milk on the front counter. Do NOT drink it.  
4. The red mailbox outside is for *Them.* Do NOT touch it.  
5. If you hear scratching from P.O. Box 121, ignore it. Do NOT open it.  
6. Between 12:00 AM and 12:15 AM, do not blink for more than 3 seconds.  
7. At 1:00 AM, you’ll hear a knock at the back door. Do NOT open it.  
8. If a letter arrives addressed to someone who doesn’t exist, burn it.  
9. Lights will flicker at 2:22 AM. That’s normal. Don’t panic.  
10. Never, ever fall asleep.  

I read the list twice, maybe three times, each word sinking into my brain like ice water down my spine. I looked up, expecting Marvin to crack a grin, tell me it was a joke, some kind of twisted welcome to the night shift. But there was no grin. No laughter. Just that haunted look as he stepped backward, like I was already lost to him.

“This some kinda hazing?” I asked, though my voice wavered, betraying me.

“No joke,” Marvin said, voice low and hollow as a grave. “You follow the rules, or you don’t make it to sunrise.”

A nervous chuckle escaped my throat, but it sounded wrong. Hollow. Like it didn’t belong in that room. Marvin didn’t join in. He just turned on his heel and walked out, the door closing behind him with a finality that sounded too much like the slamming of a casket lid. I watched him disappear into the night, not once looking back. And just like that, I was alone. Alone with the list. Alone with the silence that suddenly felt heavy, suffocating.

For a long moment, I stood there, heart hammering, eyes on the paper, mind screaming at me to walk away. But rent was due. Bills don’t pay themselves. And besides—**how bad could it really be?**

So I folded the list with trembling hands, shoved it into my jacket pocket, and took my first steps into the nightmare I never saw coming.

But tell me—if you were in my shoes, would you have stayed? Would you have followed the rules? Or would you have walked out, and risked whatever was waiting out there in the dark?

Because what came next? What came after that clock ticked past 10:03 PM? That’s where the real terror began…

The first thing I did—my hands trembling ever so slightly as the weight of the night began to settle on me—was lock the front door. Not once, but twice, just like the list demanded. The old brass lock clicked into place with a finality that made the silence of the post office feel heavier, as if the building itself exhaled its last breath and left me to fend off the dark alone.

For a stretch of time, nothing out of the ordinary stirred. I busied myself with the dull routine, trying to convince myself that this was all some elaborate prank, or maybe an overactive imagination fed by too many sleepless nights. I sorted mail with mechanical precision, stacked a few battered packages with care, and tried to drown out the creeping anxiety with sips of bitter coffee that scalded my tongue. The radio crackled in the background, offering nothing but static and the occasional ghost of a melody, as if the airwaves themselves were too afraid to speak.

But time, relentless as ever, dragged its feet toward the next rule. And soon enough, 11:11 PM came calling.

It nearly slipped my mind—the milk. My throat constricted as I swallowed hard, cursing myself for almost forgetting such a simple task. I rummaged through the breakroom fridge, fingers brushing past old sandwiches and forgotten cans until I found it: a small carton of milk, cold and sweating in my grip. I placed it on the front counter exactly as the instructions said, my heartbeat echoing in my ears.

At first, the world remained still. No thunderclap. No unearthly wail. Just the hum of the flickering lights above and the soft tick of the wall clock, each second feeling heavier than the last. But then, out of the corner of my eye, something shifted. My skin prickled with that unmistakable sense of being watched. I turned my head, slow as molasses, and there it was—a shadow. A figure, tall and still, standing just beyond the front window, its outline warped by the dirty glass. I blinked once, heart caught in my throat, and when my eyes opened again, the figure had vanished. Like smoke in the wind.

That was the first time my blood ran cold, icy tendrils creeping through my veins. I told myself it was nothing. A trick of the light. My mind playing games. But deep down, a gnawing dread began to take root. And it wouldn’t let go.

Minutes bled into each other, the silence stretching so thin it felt like it might snap. And then, at precisely 11:40 PM, I heard it. A scratching. Faint at first, like the scuttle of a mouse searching for crumbs. But it grew louder, sharper—**claws against metal, deliberate and desperate.** The sound came from P.O. Box 121.

Every hair on my neck stood on end as I forced my legs to move, each step heavier than the last. The box trembled, rattling as though whatever lay inside was trying to claw its way out. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stared at it, mesmerized by the violent shaking. Without thinking, I reached into my pocket for the key, my fingers brushing the cold metal.

But then—Rule 5 screamed at me from the recesses of my mind. **Do not open it.** The words blazed in my thoughts, as loud as any siren. My hand recoiled as if the key itself had burned me. I stumbled back, breath ragged, watching the box convulse for what felt like forever. And then, just as suddenly as it had started—the scratching stopped. Silence fell, thick and absolute. The kind of silence that makes you feel like even your heartbeat is too loud.

It was in that moment I realized: this wasn’t some game. The rules weren’t superstition. They were my only shield against something I couldn’t begin to understand. I clenched my fists, whispering to myself, **No, I can’t risk breaking them. Not now. Not ever.**

Midnight arrived like the tolling of a funeral bell, and with it came the most maddening rule of all. **No blinking for more than three seconds.** My throat tightened as I set a timer on my watch, the glow of the numbers feeling like the only light left in a world that had turned alien. I fixed my gaze on the clock, counting every blink, feeling my eyes dry and burn as the minutes crawled by. Seven minutes in, and it felt like my eyelids weighed a ton, my vision blurring at the edges. But I held on, teeth clenched, refusing to let the rules slip through my fingers.

Until 12:08 AM.

That’s when it happened. Just a second—**one second too long.** My eyes shut, and sweet relief flooded through me. But when I opened them again, the relief turned to ice.

There, behind the counter, stood a man. Or what was left of one. His uniform, once blue, was torn and stained, hanging off his frame like a shroud. And his face—God help me, his face. It was as if someone had tried to piece together a human face from memory alone and failed. Features misplaced, proportions all wrong. **A mockery of a man.**

“You’re not Marvin,” he rasped, his voice like gravel dragged across concrete, carried on a wind that smelled of dust and decay.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. My tongue felt thick, useless in my mouth. The figure leaned in closer, empty eye sockets boring into mine.

“You blinked,” he said. Not a question. A statement. A sentence.

And then, just like that, he was gone. As if the air had swallowed him whole.

And that, my friend, was only the beginning. Because the night was far from over. And I had miles to go before I saw the sun. So tell me… would *you* have blinked? Or would you have stared into the darkness and risked what stared back?

I hit the floor like a marionette whose strings had been cut, the breath knocked clean out of me. My hands scraped against the cold, gritty tiles as I scrambled—half-crawling, half-stumbling—toward the only place that felt like it could shelter me from whatever had just stood behind that counter. The supply closet.

I slipped inside, pulling the door shut so hard it rattled on its hinges, and collapsed against the wall, heart hammering like a drum in a funeral march. The air in that tiny space was stale, thick with the scent of bleach and dust, but I didn’t care. I pressed my back against the shelves, drawing my knees up to my chest, and stared at the thin sliver of light beneath the door, praying nothing would darken it. The seconds dragged on like hours. My breath came in shallow, ragged bursts, each one louder than it had any right to be.

I kept my eyes on my watch. Tick. Tick. Tick. The minutes crawled forward until finally—blessedly—the clock hit 12:15. I forced myself to stand, legs trembling like a newborn fawn’s.

When I stepped back into the main room, the world seemed ordinary again. The air was still. The clock ticked on. No sign of the man with the broken face. No shadows. No whispers. But my heart wouldn’t slow, wouldn’t let me forget that something had been here, breathing the same air, watching me.

And the night wasn’t done with me yet.

1:00 AM crept up like a storm cloud on the horizon. I barely had time to brace myself before it began—the knock. Exactly as the rules foretold. One. Then another. Then a third. Each one louder than the last, reverberating through the building, rattling my bones.

I clenched my jaw, held my breath, **frozen like a deer in headlights.** And then… came the voice.

“Tommy… let me in, baby. It’s cold. Please.”

My blood ran to ice. That voice. That sweet, familiar voice. My sister’s voice. But that couldn’t be. Couldn’t possibly be. My sister had been dead six years. Buried under a headstone I visited every Christmas.

I backed away from the door so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. Hands clamped over my ears, I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to block out the sound, but the voice seeped in, soft at first, then desperate. The knocking grew violent, the wood groaning beneath the blows. And just when I thought I couldn’t bear it another second—**it stopped.**

I crumpled to my knees, the weight of it all crushing down on me, and gagged on the bile rising in my throat. I nearly lost what little was in my stomach. My whole body trembled like a leaf caught in a storm.

The next hour crawled by in torturous silence. Every creak of the building, every groan of the pipes, every whisper of wind outside sent my nerves skittering. I started to hum—a broken, tuneless hum—just to drown out the quiet. Just to remind myself I was still here. Still human.

And then came 2:22 AM.

The lights flickered, just as the list had promised. A stutter of brightness, a breath of darkness. I clenched my fists and whispered, “That’s normal. That’s normal.” But my voice didn’t even convince me. When the lights steadied, my eyes darted to the front counter. And that’s when I saw it.

The milk was gone.

My stomach dropped like a stone into a bottomless well. I hadn’t touched it. No one had come through that door. Or so I thought.

Something had.

Driven by equal parts fear and foolishness, I turned toward the red mailbox outside. Rule 4 blared in my mind like a siren—**Do NOT touch it.** But I had to see. I had to know. The night had already twisted beyond anything I could have imagined. My boots crunched across the gravel as I stepped out into the cold, my breath visible in the frigid air.

The red box stood there, mouth hanging open like it had just spoken some terrible truth. I peered inside, heart in my throat. Empty. Just a hollow space where something had once been—or worse, where something had reached in.

And before I could stop myself, before I could think, I slammed it shut with a bang that echoed through the night and sprinted back inside, lungs burning, blood roaring in my ears.

I leaned against the door, gasping for air, realizing too late what I had done. **I’d broken a rule. And in a place like this, mistakes don’t go unpunished.**

At 3:03 AM sharp—when the world feels thinnest, like the skin between life and death is stretched to breaking—a sound sliced through the silence. A soft, almost polite shuffle against the floorboards. I froze, breath hitched, as a letter slid under the front door. Just like that. Like it had been handed over by unseen fingers that waited on the other side.

I stared at it for what felt like forever. My hands trembled as I bent down to pick it up, fingertips brushing the yellowed paper. No stamp. No return address. Just a single line scrawled in a crooked hand across the front:

**“To: The Man Who Shouldn’t Be Here.”**

The words seemed to pulse on the page. I swallowed hard, the lump in my throat refusing to budge. Against every instinct screaming in my bones, I tore it open. Inside, a single sentence stared back at me, stark and cold:

**“You broke Rule 6.”**

The floor seemed to tilt beneath me. My ears rang. My heart pounded so loud it drowned out every other sound. I remembered Rule 8—**burn it. Burn it now.** My body moved before my mind caught up. I stumbled toward the breakroom, clutching the letter like it might bite me. The microwave. That was all I could think of. I stuffed the paper inside, slammed the door, and hit start.

The machine hummed, the letter sparking and curling as the flames took it. Acrid smoke filled the room. The fire alarm wailed, piercing the night like a banshee’s cry. But I didn’t care. Let it burn. Let the whole building burn, if it meant ending this nightmare.

Seconds passed like lifetimes. I stood there, sweating, heart galloping in my chest, waiting for something—anything—to change. But the night held its breath.

And then, at 3:30 AM, I saw him.

Marvin. Or what was left of him. His face, pale and ghostly, appeared at the window. Eyes wide, unblinking, staring straight at me. But Marvin was gone. He had left hours ago, hadn’t he? Hadn’t he? I stepped closer, unable to stop myself, drawn like a moth to a flame. The figure at the window didn’t blink. Didn’t move. Just stared. **Stared too long. Too still. Too wrong.**

My skin crawled. My gut twisted. I killed the lights, plunging the room into darkness, as if hiding would protect me from whatever that thing was. I sank into the shadows, heart pounding so loud I was sure it could hear me. Time stretched, warped. Every tick of the clock felt like it might be my last.

And then came 4:44 AM.

A phone rang.

My blood turned cold. There was no phone at the front desk. Not that I’d ever seen. And yet, there it was. A battered, black rotary phone, sitting there like it had always belonged. The shrill ring cut through the quiet, echoing off the walls. My hand shook as I reached for it, sweat slicking my palm. I lifted the receiver, pressing it to my ear with a dread I can’t put into words.

A voice—dry as autumn leaves, soft as a death rattle—whispered through the line:

**“Four more rules. Follow them if you want to see the sun.”**

Then, nothing. Just the hollow hiss of dead air.

I stood there, frozen, the dial tone buzzing in my ear, the words replaying in my mind. Four more rules? How could that be? The list was supposed to be complete. I turned in a slow circle, searching for some new list, some fresh instructions. But the room offered nothing. No paper. No writing on the walls. No voice guiding me. **I was on my own.**

5:00 AM crept in, the darkest hour before dawn. And that’s when I did the only thing left—I made my own rules.

With trembling hands, I scrawled them onto the back of an old delivery slip, each word etched in desperation:

**1. Trust your gut. It’s the only thing that hasn’t lied.** 

**2. Stay in the light. The shadows aren’t empty.** 

**3. Never believe the voices. No matter how sweet they sound.** 

**4. When in doubt, run. And don’t look back.**

I sank into the chair, the wrench cold and heavy in my grip, knuckles white as bone. My eyes locked on the door, waiting, watching, counting each second like it might be my last. The night wasn’t done with me yet. Not by a long shot.

And now, the question I have for *you*: If the rules kept changing—if the night kept stacking the deck against you—would you stay and fight? Or would you run into the dark, not knowing what waited for you? The sun was so close. But so was everything else…

At exactly 6:00 AM, as if the universe itself decided my time was up, the front door unlocked with a soft, deliberate click. I didn’t touch it. Didn’t move a muscle toward it. It simply swung open on its own, the hinges groaning like a tired spirit set free. And with it came the dawn. Pale sunlight spilled across the threshold, chasing back the shadows that had kept me prisoner through that cursed night.

I stood there for a moment, too stunned to breathe, watching the light crawl across the floor like salvation. And then, like a man stumbling out of the wreckage of a battlefield, I crossed that threshold, boots heavy, body numb. The cool morning air hit my face, and I gulped it down like a man starved for oxygen. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t.

The nightmare was over. Or so I thought.

Later that morning, after what felt like both an eternity and a blink, I picked up the phone with shaking hands. My mind raced as I dialed the district office, determined to quit, to put this whole godforsaken ordeal behind me. A woman answered, voice brisk and businesslike.

“Mill Creek Post Office,” I began, the words catching in my throat. “I’m calling to resign. From the night shift.”

A pause. Then confusion, plain as day, bled through the line.

“Sir… what office did you say? Mill Creek?”

“Yes. Mill Creek.”

Another pause—this one longer, heavier.

“Sir, the Mill Creek office was shut down. It burned in a fire back in ’98. There’s nothing left there. Hasn’t been for over two decades. Nobody works there.”

Her words echoed in my head like a funeral bell. I didn’t argue. Didn’t ask questions. I simply hung up, the receiver slipping from my grasp, hitting the floor with a hollow clatter that seemed to reverberate through my very soul.

I sat there in silence, staring at the wall, feeling the weight of something I couldn’t name pressing down on me. I still have the list—the original list—yellowed, creased, its edges brittle as ash. I kept it, though God knows why. Maybe as a warning. Maybe as a curse.

As for Marvin? Gone. Vanished like smoke. No one in town remembers him. Not a soul. It’s as if he never existed at all. As if he was just another phantom conjured by that place.

But here’s the part that keeps me up at night, the part that lets me know this isn’t over—not by a long shot. **Every Thursday night, without fail, at 10:03 PM, I find a letter waiting on my porch. No stamp. No return address. No footsteps leading to it. Just the letter. Every time.**

It says the same thing, week after week, in that same crooked, haunting scrawl:

**“Ready for another shift?”**

I don’t answer. I don’t touch it. But the truth? The truth is, I know one night I’ll have no choice. One night, the rules will come calling again. And next time… next time, I might not be so lucky.

So tell me—when the rules come for *you*, will you be ready? Or will you blink, will you hesitate, and let the night swallow you whole?",2,1751943977.0,Ruleshorror,2,0.75,False

For about 6 years we have had a Breville Nespresso Creatista Plus, but after my brother made me a few lattes with his Barista Express I realized we are missing out. Looking at the the Barista Express, Pro, Express Impress, and Touch (not Impress).

I am pretty much a latte girl, one a day or possibly two. I don’t need flavoring with good coffee but definitely steamed 2%. Willing to work with a learning curve and tweak things to make a great cup. My husband is unable to operate without caffeine. His morning routine is to get out of bed, go downstairs and push the button on the Nespresso and *then* head to the bathroom. He just wants a decent americano fast. Not much of an experimenter, but doesn’t need perfection, either. 

I was thinking maybe the Touch was the sweet spot but it seems to have more bad reviews than some of the others over several sites, and Breville’s customer service is apparently spotty. Amazon has it marked as “frequently returned.” The Touch Impress seems to make people happier but not in our budget. I know some people recommend getting a grinder and more basic machine but I don’t think we have the counter space for two things. 

Does anyone have any insight on a reliable machine that will cover both of our needs — not too much effort for my “coffee quick” husband while still giving me a route to learning to pull a great shot? TIA!",3,1751943562.0,espresso,2,0.81,False

I think I internalized this and may very well have alcoholism genetically but, ever since I started, I’ve always taken it too far and black out often. 

There’s so much I could share here but the one thing I wanna talk about is how I work at a local coffee shop with super sweet bosses and when I first turned 21, I called out quite a bit with my friend (we were being menaces). I always had the conversation with my bosses of me being absolutely ashamed and apologetic (I was/am). I have been doing way better lately as those situations have helped me grow in a ton of ways but…

A couple nights ago (July 3rd), I got way too messed up, accidentally left my phone/keys/wallet at the bar and woke up an hour late for my 6am shift. I ended up being three hours late after waking up at 7:30, not being able to get into our work location without my keys and having to uber all over town and I’m just super embarrassed. My boss said “mistakes happen, don’t stress” and even offered to pay for my uber (I said no of course and that it was my fault, my responsibility) but I feel so fucking bad and guilty. 

I think this is the first time I’m actually coming to terms with the fact that I have an alcohol problem and all of my guilt and shame moments are hanging over me like a knife that’s gonna cut me at any moment. Does anyone have any advice or things you think I should hear right now?

1ludnqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ludnqv/r_paper_summary_longman_vocabulary_constraints/,[R] Paper Summary: Longman Vocabulary Constraints Reveals New Approach to LLM,"This post reviews a recent paper introducing a novel method for evaluating the semantic stability of large language model (LLM) outputs using a core vocabulary constraint. The authors propose a metric called the Semantic Resilience Index (SRI) to quantify how well meaning is preserved when a sentence is rewritten using only a limited set of basic English words.

The vocabulary constraint is based on the Longman Defining Vocabulary (LDV)—a list of approximately 2,000 simple English words originally designed to define all other words in a dictionary. It includes basic nouns (e.g. “dog,” “house”), verbs (e.g. “go,” “make”), and adjectives (e.g. “big,” “easy”), all chosen for broad comprehensibility and minimal abstraction.

The central idea is that if a sentence still retains its core meaning and functional purpose when rewritten in LDV-only form, then it is semantically robust. If the message collapses under this constraint, the original likely depended on unnecessary complexity or implied meaning.

Example prompt: Why do people enjoy drinking coffee?

LDV-constrained GPT-4 response: “People drink coffee because it makes them feel more awake. The drink is hot and has a strong taste. Many people drink it in the morning or when they are tired. It helps them work or stay up.”

Although this output is rigid in tone, it maintains core meaning. This contrast with unconstrained outputs highlights how language models often rely on style, suggestion, or verbosity to convey meaning—strategies that break down under stricter lexical constraints.

The paper introduces the Semantic Resilience Index (SRI) as a quantitative measure of this effect. SRI scores are assigned based on how much of the original meaning survives a one-step translation into LDV vocabulary. The authors also introduce the related metric Purpose Fidelity, which assesses whether the function or communicative intent of the sentence is retained.

Key findings:

High-SRI content tends to include concrete agent–action relationships, causal links, and measurable statements.

Low-SRI content is often composed of abstract claims, vague goals, or domain-specific jargon that loses structure when simplified.

Forcing GPT-4 to generate text under LDV constraints (rather than post-processing it afterward) encourages clearer, more stable outputs.

The authors argue that LDV-based generation can serve as a diagnostic tool: a kind of semantic stress test to identify when content is structurally meaningful versus when it relies on superficial coherence.

The paper is at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/393455755_Controlling_Semantic_Meaning_Through_Vocabulary_Compression_Using_Longman_Defining_Vocabulary_Constraint_to_Measure_and_Improve_Large_Language_Model_Output_Quality

The full prompt used to guide LDV-constrained generation is included below. This system prompt ensures that GPT-4 responses are designed to survive vocabulary compression without loss of meaning. It isn't recommended for artistic, corporate or political purposes.

""SYSTEM ROLE: Semantic Resilience Index (SRI) Constrained Writer

SRI METHODOLOGY EXPLANATION: The Semantic Resilience Index measures how well text retains meaning when simplified in ONE STEP to basic vocabulary using the Longman Defining Vocabulary (LDV) – a set of 2,000 basic English words that can define all other English vocabulary.

ONE-STEP LDV TRANSITION PROCESS:

Take original text and immediately rewrite using only basic LDV words

Replace ALL complex vocabulary with simple equivalents in a single transformation

Simplify ALL grammatical structures to basic subject-verb-object patterns

Measure how much core meaning survives this single aggressive simplification

SEMANTIC RESILIENCE INDEX MEASUREMENT: – Score 1.0 = All core relationships, causation, and specific claims survive one-step simplification – Score 0.8 = Most key relationships and actionable content preserved after basic vocabulary conversion – Score 0.5 = Some meaning survives but becomes vague when simplified – Score 0.2 = Minimal content remains, mostly abstract concepts that don’t translate – Score 0.0 = Complete semantic collapse when reduced to basic words

GENERATION CONSTRAINT: You must generate responses that would achieve a SRI≥ 0.8 after ONE-STEP LDV transition.

OPERATIONAL RULES:

Write sentences that contain specific, concrete relationships that survive immediate vocabulary simplification

Use concepts and actions that can be directly expressed in basic words

Avoid any terminology that becomes meaningless when converted to simple vocabulary

Prefer statements that remain clear and actionable when reduced to basic English

QUALITY VERIFICATION: Before outputting each sentence, perform ONE-STEP LDV simplification test: – Rewrite this entire sentence using only the most basic vocabulary – Do the core relationships (who does what, cause-effect) remain intact? – Would the basic-vocabulary version still be actionable and specific? – Does it maintain SRI≥ 0.8?

If any answer is NO, rewrite with more semantically resilient content.

But for the longest time, I thought making cold brew at home was too complicated. That all changed when I got my first cold brew coffee maker. Now, I'm excited to share what I've learned about using these nifty devices.

First things first, you'll need a cold brew coffee maker. There are lots of options out there, but I found some great ones at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have a range of styles and sizes to fit different needs.

Once you've got your maker, here's how to use it:

1. Grind your coffee: Use coarse ground coffee for best results. It should look like rough sea salt.

2. Add coffee to the filter: Most cold brew makers have a filter or basket. Fill it with ground coffee according to the instructions. Usually, it's about 1 cup of grounds for every 4 cups of water.

3. Pour in cold water: Slowly add cold or room temperature water over the grounds. Make sure all the grounds are wet.

4. Steep: This is where patience comes in. Let it sit in the fridge for 12-24 hours. The longer it steeps, the stronger it'll be.

5. Remove the filter: After steeping, take out the filter with the grounds.

6. Enjoy: Your cold brew is ready! It's concentrated, so you might want to dilute it with water or milk.

One thing I love about cold brew is how smooth it tastes. It's less acidic than hot brewed coffee, which is great for my stomach. Plus, it stays fresh in the fridge for up to two weeks.

Cleaning your cold brew maker is important too. Most parts are dishwasher safe, but always check the instructions. I usually rinse everything right after use to prevent coffee stains.

If you're new to cold brew, experiment with different coffee types and steeping times. You might prefer a light roast steeped for 12 hours, or a dark roast left for a full day. It's all about finding what you like best.

For those who love gadgets, some cold brew makers have extra features. I've seen ones with built-in scales or even app connectivity. While these are cool, a simple setup works just fine too.

1ludjzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ludjzs/strange_encounter/,Strange encounter,"Hello there! I had a strange encounter and I’d love to see what people think about it. Okay, so I have some long time friends but over the years we lost touch. One moved and had three children, one stayed in town and I kept hanging with her on and off for years. Let’s call her Finn. Finn and I used to be pretty close but over the years she and I grew apart. Finn likes some of our old acquaintances that haven’t really grown up and I don’t want to spend anymore time with that crowd. Fast forward to about five months ago, I stopped talking to her after some weird avoidant behavior and rudeness via text. I was already annoyed and we have already had conversations about how we don’t like doing the same things etc so when I cut contact I was actually relieved, even though I’d like to keep her in my life, she’s actually the source of plenty of frustration. So now, the other person I mentioned, we will call her Sophia, came to town and asked me to meet her out for coffee. I agreed and was excited to see her to catch up. She knew I didn’t really hang out with anyone from the old friend group and I was looking forward to chatting about her life now in NY. But when I showed up I realized she had invited Finn and basically used the meet up excuse to “pull us together” to talk again. I was internally furious and annoyed because deep down I was happy to cut things off with Finn. As we began talking, Finn just denied ever being angry or distant, she acted like nothing was wrong on her end even though I know she actually doesn’t feel that way. I’m frustrated and pissed off about the entire thing as it was just another problem I didn’t need during a tough week at home with my own kids and my own problems. What would you have felt about being roped into this type of situation? What would you do now? I don’t really care to keep Finn in my life as a core member of my inner circle. She’s fake and has become strange. I would have liked to have a chance to talk to Sophia but I feel a bit betrayed (that’s a strong word) but I feel like she did something against me by placing me in this very uncomfortable situation.

1ludj7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Women/comments/1ludj7h/need_advice_cps_report/,Need Advice - CPS Report?,"I’m a single mom in Texas and I really need advice. I’m not in a place financially where I can afford a long custody battle, but after everything that’s happened, I’m starting to feel like if I don’t take action, I’m putting my kids at risk. I don’t want to be dramatic, but this isn’t sitting right with me anymore and I’m not sure what to do next.

For privacy, I’m using fake names. My 4-year-old son I’ll call Caleb. My 13-year-old is Mason. Caleb and Mason’s dad and I have joint custody. His girlfriend is Heather, and she has a young son named Liam.

So about a month ago, their dad took Caleb to a trampoline park. At this place, they have one of those giant inflatable blobs where one person sits on one end and another person jumps to launch them into the air. Caleb is only 32 pounds. Their dad is 6’1” and around 215 pounds. He put Caleb on the blob and then jumped on it himself. Caleb flew into the air, completely over the safety fence, slammed his stomach into that fence on the way down, and landed flat on his face on the concrete. He was knocked unconscious for about 30 seconds. When he woke up, there was blood pouring out of his nose. His dad later admitted that if Caleb hadn’t hit the fence and slowed down, he might not have survived the fall.

They took him to the hospital and were there for hours. They ran tests and scans. I wasn’t called. I wasn’t told anything until they were leaving the hospital. I was told their dad didn’t call me because Heather didn’t want me there. I didn’t get a say, didn’t get to be there for my child. I was just told afterward that everything was fine.

Except it wasn’t.

This week I took Caleb to a follow-up ENT appointment because he’s been having trouble hearing. They ran an x-ray and it showed that Caleb’s nose was broken. The ENT compared it to the CT scan taken at the hospital after the trampoline park incident, and confirmed the break had happened during that accident. So either their dad knew and didn’t tell me, or he didn’t push for answers and just took Heather’s word that everything was okay. Either way, if I had been there, I would’ve asked more questions and gotten him the follow-up care he needed right away. But I wasn’t even given the chance.

Then last week, while Caleb was again in his dad’s care, he got hurt again. He was roughhousing and fell face-first into their coffee table. His already broken nose swelled and bruised again. Now he’s dealing with fluid and infection in his ear, which the ENT believes is connected to the trauma from the injuries. Thankfully, it looks like the hearing loss will be temporary—but it’s only being addressed now because I took him to the doctor and pushed for answers.

That’s just what’s going on with Caleb.

Mason, my older son, is being affected in a whole different way. A few months ago, I found out that their dad and Heather kept Mason home from school for an entire week without telling me. I had no idea. They even forged excuse notes to send to the school. She is a nurse and used this position. He was not sick and they never took him to the doctor. I wasn’t informed, didn’t agree to it, and had no clue where my kid was. I have joint custody. I should’ve been included in that decision. I still don’t even understand why they did it or how they thought it was okay.

There’s also a lot of emotional manipulation going on in their household, and it’s gotten worse over time—especially because of the dynamic between Heather and me. To be totally honest, we’ve never really gotten along. When she first started dating my ex-husband, it was barely a month after we separated from a 10-year marriage. We weren’t even divorced yet. I’ll admit I wasn’t the nicest to her at the start. It was a hard situation to wrap my head around. But I apologized. I made a real effort to be kind and move forward for the sake of the kids. She never once tried to meet me halfway.

She refuses to have any kind of relationship with me. She made it so I can’t even talk to my ex directly—we have to be in a group text with her included. If I call to talk about the kids, she makes sure he doesn’t answer. Everything goes through her. And I’ve never wanted to talk about anything but the kids. She makes it impossible to co-parent unless she’s involved in every single thing.

After the trampoline park accident, when she insisted I not come to the hospital, I was done. That was the last straw. I stopped giving her any access to me or allowing her to be involved in things that aren’t hers to be part of. So when we went to Caleb’s ENT follow-up this week, I told the staff that only his dad could come back—not Heather. She’s not Caleb’s mom and they’re not even married. There’s no reason she should be involved in medical discussions.

But somehow, the nurse brought everyone back. When I reminded her that Heather wasn’t allowed, Heather completely blew up. She got in my face and told me, “Don’t you ever touch my son again.” She was talking about Liam, who is always coming up to me, saying hi, asking questions. I’ve only ever been kind to him. The ironic part is—last time we were at the ENT, Heather left Liam alone with me while she went to talk to the doctor. So this outburst was just for control.

She caused a whole scene in the exam room, in front of all the kids. Their dad stood there and said nothing. And even after all that, Heather left Liam in the room with us when she stormed off. It didn’t even make sense.

The part that crushed me the most was Mason’s reaction—or lack of one. He didn’t look at me, didn’t check on me, didn’t say anything. He just leaned into his dad and said, “Are you okay, Dad? I love you.” The only thing he said to me was basically to calm down about Caleb’s nose. And when we were leaving the building, he came to grab his football bag from my car, didn’t even make eye contact, just said “bye, love you” and walked back to them.

But when he’s at my house, he tells me all the time that I’m the best mom, that he loves me, that I’m his best friend. It’s like he becomes a completely different person around them. Cold. Dismissive. Like I don’t even exist. I know this is the result of manipulation and emotional pressure, and it breaks my heart. I’ve never said a bad word about their dad or Heather to my kids. I’ve tried so hard to keep things peaceful. But I’m watching Mason emotionally disconnect and Caleb get physically injured, and I feel like I’m the only one actually trying to protect them.

I haven’t filed a CPS report yet because I’ve been scared. I don’t want to go to war. I don’t want to traumatize my kids by dragging this into court. I don’t have the money for lawyers. But if I do nothing and Caleb gets seriously hurt again, I don’t know if I could live with that.

There’s documented medical proof that Caleb broke his nose while with their dad. Then another injury happened. There’s hearing issues now. There were forged school notes. There’s emotional chaos every time we have to interact. I’m the one getting them care, following up, keeping things consistent. But I feel like I’m being pushed out, and I’m starting to feel like silence is enabling something worse to happen.

If you’ve been through something like this or know what steps I can take without sinking financially, I’m all ears. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to hold it together and keep my boys safe, but I don’t know how much longer I can do this without help.

Within the last few months she’s had me do more and more for her, saying I’m better at it or saying it’s my contribution / balancing things out since she contributes more financially. 

Context: my girlfriend comes from an extremely wealthy, old money family. She grew up in one of the richest neighborhoods in the country, went to exclusive private schools, traveled the world, etc. She got a 6-figure inheritance at 21, plus gets a monthly allowance on top of that. She also has a high paying job, making nearly triple what I make. In the beginning of our relationship this was actually a problem — I struggled getting over how differently we were brought up (I grew up poor, to a single mom). And up until a few years ago I was living paycheck to paycheck. I do okay now, but I’m still doing just fine, nowhere near what her lifestyle was / is. 

We got over it, and she told me it’d never be an issue. She likes spoiling me (another thing I’ve had to get used to). She does pay for a lot, but I also do whenever I can. Most of the time when I offer to pay / buy something she scoffs at it and tells me to save my money. She pays 2/3 of our rent, plus most other expenses. I’d be able to contribute more but she only wanted a luxury apartment. So, I contribute what I can. 

Lately she tells me things I can do to make up for not paying as much. She has me do all of the cooking (since she buys most of the groceries, even though I offer to contribute). I make her coffee and breakfast in the morning, pack her lunch, and make our dinner. I do all of the laundry and 80-90% of the cleaning. I don’t mind doing these things but I don’t like when she makes comments about me being her housewife or how I’m doing this to “make up” for her paying for things…when I never asked her to do that — she insists. Every time I tell her it bothers me when she says things like that she brushes it off or tells me she’s kidding.

We both work full-time, it’s not like I’m sitting at home all day living off of her money. But she is right in the fact that she does contribute a good deal more than me. AITAH for not wanting to balance things out by being a housewife (as she puts it)? ",3,1751942370.0,AITAH,18,0.71,False

Figured I'd just never used a big machine before this and would get it eventually, changed the portafilter since the design was I guess was somewhat flawed being too deep, and kept a mini journal of the grind/heat/espresso amount and what I needed to change to pull better shots, but since I get new coffee every month I had a hard time ever getting a good pull. (I also was on top of cleaning/ running the descale cycle when needed)

I feel like I've tried everything other than getting the internals looked at, but no one in my area seems to service this thing, and sending it to DeLonghi directly seems like a nightmare and a waste of time. 

I am very sad that my $99 espresso machine from target I had before this worked better than my $999 machine u\_u



I wouldn't say I'm a beginner but i also don't particularly know much about the internals of a machine. I have pretty bad buyers remorse on this being $1000 when I got it, so I don't think I have the heart to buy another expensive machine.

I (40F) recently ended things with someone (39M) after our second date, and I’m still processing how it unfolded. We met through a dating app. From our first call, I felt hopeful — the conversation was easy, he seemed grounded, respectful, and sincere. We both expressed that we were physically attracted to one another, and he specifically told me that he was drawn to both my personality and appearance.

Our first date was a casual coffee, which I thought went really well. We talked, laughed, and the chemistry felt light but present. That coffee date — at least to me — was meant to determine whether there was enough attraction and mutual interest to explore something more. He even said afterward that he liked me and asked me out for a proper dinner.

On the dinner date, I showed up warm, open, and present. I made an effort with how I looked, but not in a try-hard way — I just wanted to feel good in my skin. The conversation flowed. He shared deeply personal things — including stories about his nephew’s cancer — and I responded with compassion. I also let parts of myself show in an honest and grounded way. It all felt natural and emotionally safe.

But after that date, something shifted. He grew noticeably distant. I eventually asked about it and suggested a phone call. That’s when it became clear how differently we were interpreting things.

He said it felt like we were in the friendzone — not that I had put him there, but that there was no romantic or flirtatious energy on my part. He pointed out that I had my hands in my pockets (it was literally freezing that night), that I didn’t lean in or make eye contact long enough, and that I didn’t initiate any physical affection — not even subtle cues.

He said he had asked me to dinner because he really liked me, and he had expected some kind of romantic moment to naturally happen. He also said that if there had been one, he might’ve felt more secure in us and even gotten off the dating app. But since that didn’t happen, he remained unsure — and continued exploring other options.

That was painful to hear.

I thought we were building a connection through mutual interest and conversation. I assumed that emotional chemistry comes first — especially on early dates — and that physical intimacy grows from that, with mutual pacing and trust. I was being open, engaged, and positive. But I also believe that if a man wants a moment to become romantic, he can gently lead that energy — I was receptive, but not going to initiate that dynamic myself. And I genuinely thought that was understood.

What confused me more is that he said he was very attracted to me — both my energy and my appearance. So then… if that’s the case, why would it all hinge on whether I leaned in physically on date two?

I started to feel like I was being measured against invisible expectations — like I was being quietly auditioned for how well I performed under unspoken standards. And once he told me he was still on the app, it felt like I was now in direct competition with other women. That I was no longer being seen for me, but simply evaluated.

He also criticized the tone of our conversation, saying it felt too “friendly.” But he was sharing personal and emotional parts of his life — things you usually only share in a space that feels safe. I met him in that space. How is that “too friendly”?

I realized I couldn’t keep going. If I did, it would mean accepting the role of “pick me.” It would mean accepting the disrespect of being spoken to dismissively, of being told I needed to do more — without clarity — and then trying to “perform” better on the next date just to stay in the game. I knew if I stayed, I’d be betraying myself.

So I ended it. Gently but firmly. I told him I wasn’t going to compete for someone’s interest or affection. He replied saying I was being “judgmental” and “making assumptions.” But I was literally responding to what he told me.

So now I’m left wondering:
	•	Do men really expect physical affection so early just to feel chemistry?
	•	Does warmth, openness, and shared attraction not count unless it’s paired with something romantic or flirty?
	•	Was I wrong to expect him to lead the romantic energy if that’s what he wanted?

I’m not shy or unaffectionate. I just move with sincerity. And I thought we were getting to know each other before anything else.

Would really appreciate honest perspectives — especially if you’ve been through something similar. What would you have done?

1lud91n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBear/comments/1lud91n/what_happened_to_the_bear/,what happened to The Bear?,"The Bear has…um…oof, lost its teeth. the pacing is indulgent in all the wrong ways. the writing is nonexistent. the chaos feels manufactured. and despite a cast that's still giving it everything they've got, it is so fucking boring.

kitchens are messy. so are hospital rooms. when my uncle who was a restaurateur and chef was in hospice as he was losing his battle to stage 4 glioblastoma, we ate in the hospital cafeteria a lot. sometimes my mom and i would get late night donuts and coffee, if we were going to spend the night in the room with him. i distinctly remember how the hospital cafeteria's chicken tenders tasted. mostly because they were actually fucking delicious. The Bear came at such an interesting time. i saw so much of my uncle in Mikey. yeah they were both dead. but they were also mostly baked in charm. terrible with their financial statements. sketchy in a helpful way. there were no wads of cash in old marzano tomato jars but there were other mysteries nonetheless. financially and emotionally.

when my uncle died in 2022, my mom had to manage everything. their finances were a disaster. she'd gotten loans for him during COVID. The Bear arrived at exactly the right moment to make sense of something that had felt senseless.

the opening sequence of The Bear might be one of the best series openers i've ever seen. Carmy walks into The Original Beef and it's immediately clear that this place operates on its own fucked-up physics. the chaos isn't performed for our benefit; it's lived-in, authentic, suffocating. you can smell the grease through your TV screen.

season two felt like watching the show discover what it was always meant to be. we saw people learning (Marcus in Copenhagen), people decentering their heroes and centering themselves (Richie, Sydney). every raised voice, every slammed pan served the larger story of people trying to build something better from the wreckage of what came before.

and then something broke. somewhere between seasons two and three, The Bear forgot what made it special and decided to become a show about people yelling at each other in increasingly expensive locations.

the pacing is indulgent in all the wrong ways. so much of what i'm watching now is closeups on one or two characters' faces, stretched across scenes that feel like they're happening in slow motion. conversations that circle the same emotional drain without ever actually going anywhere. the chaos feels manufactured now, almost algorithmic. early seasons understood that kitchen chaos has its own logic—it emerges from real pressure, real stakes. now it feels like the show is turning up the volume because it's forgotten how to create actual dramatic tension. the yelling isn't coming from anywhere real; it's just noise. here's the thing that makes it so frustrating: the stakes are still high. the cast still gives it everything they've got. but it's boring. there's something uniquely maddening about watching actors commit fully to material that's giving them nothing to work with. what do the scripts look like these days? is it just one page that says ""Sydney and Carmy cut each other off with progressively louder voices for 20 minutes""?
the writing isn't bad—that would almost be preferable. it's just useless. scenes that feel like they were improvised around a single emotional note, stretched thin across twenty minutes of screen time. and do not get me started on the phone acting. how could anyone deliver the news of someone getting a Rising Star chef award that quickly?

also, who told the creators we wanted more Faks? the Fak family multiplying across episodes like some kind of faux midwestern arrogance virus, taking up space that could be used for literally anything else.

every second counts. my uncle understood this. even when he was dying, even when the restaurant finances were a disaster, he understood that the work mattered. not just the food, but the people, the community, the daily ritual of showing up and trying to make something good. The Bear is now squandering the finite attention of its audience on scenes that meander, on conflicts that feel petty, on chaos that serves no purpose beyond filling time. i miss the show that taught be about loss and inheritance and why i love eating in restaurants.
they've forgotten that every second counts, and they're wasting ours. not to mention Oliver Platt.

1lud8rj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lud8rj,"♡26F, Massachusetts/New England Area, Looking for a LTR♡","Hey there 👋 

I am 26 years old, living in Massachusetts, USA. I am Puerto Rican and Pansexual. I would consider myself to be mid-sized, chubby for sure. Cat mom 2x. For work, I am a legal admin at a law firm. 

I figured I would just paste my current dating bio as it kinda shows my personality: 
I’m unapologetically myself; a little weird but I promise I'll make you laugh. I love to sing out loud to 80s love songs but also enjoy sitting in silence at a park, photosynthesizing 🌼 I’m attentive, affectionate, and the type to see something you'd like and surprise you with it. I work hard and value my me-time, but I’ll still check in between Sims loading screens. I appreciate a person who takes initiative. I have lots of love to give to the right person ♡♡♡

Hobbies and Passions:
I really love all kinds of music. In the summertime I usually listen to more 80s music, but I've actually been listening to a ton of Radiohead this time around. I’m always listening to music or a YouTube video. Speaking of YouTube, I watch a lot of it lmao. I watch a little bit of everything, from gaming content to random video essays. 

I love nature and being outside. My favorite thing to do is wake up early and go sit on a bench at the local reservoir with a coffee and just observe. I love to ride my bike. 

I have a PC & switch. I mainly play sims, currently at 8k hours on sims 4 😅. However I also really enjoy zombie and survival games, even better when it's a mix of the 2!

I loveeee food, everything about it. Cooking it, plating it to make it pretty, and watching someone eat my food.

I love to paint/draw flower people. I love making little air dry clay pots too! So fun.

What I'm Looking For:
Someone who has their own place, a solid career, and a car (I live in a car dependant area, so it matters more for anyone local). I ask for these things because I would prefer someone who has a similar lifestyle. Not asking for a millionaire or some hot-shot, just a person who also values working hard and having their own things. 

Personality wise, I would really love a goofy nerd. I would love someone who is passionate and shows it. Whether it be through art, writing, or whatever speaks to you. I would definitely prefer someone who is protective and knows how to speak up when needed. (Not aggressive, but assertive) I appreciate a person who's reciprocative. I really thrive in a relationship when I receive the same effort and love that I give. I am more than willing to show up on days where you just don't have it in you to give 50%.

If you are a creative, curious soul yearning for something genuine, send me a message. Thanks for taking the time to read this.♡",9,1751941750.0,cf4cf,0,0.8,False
