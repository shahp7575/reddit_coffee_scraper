my order
- grande
- iced matcha latte
- oatmilk
- a pump of brown sugar
- a shot of chai

i like it because it tastes like toasty ginger bread and i've ordered it many times at many locations. until now.

the barista seemed taken aback when i asked for chai. then they asked if i wanted it to be sweetened or sweetened with the brown sugar? my entire world is dissolving...what's happening behind that counter?

is there a simplified way to order that without it seeming weird?

1j72nop,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1j72nop/how_much_caffeine_in_matcha_vs_coffee_the/,How Much Caffeine in Matcha Vs Coffee: The Ultimate Comparison,"**Matcha and coffee are popular beverages. Both offer an energy boost.**

But how much caffeine do they contain? Caffeine content is a key factor when choosing a drink. Matcha and coffee have different amounts of caffeine. Understanding these differences can help you decide which fits your needs best. Whether you seek a gentle lift or a strong kick, knowing the caffeine levels can guide you.

This comparison will provide clarity and help you choose the best option for your lifestyle.



# Caffeine Content In Matcha

Matcha and coffee are popular beverages known for their caffeine content. Many people wonder how much caffeine they consume with each drink. Understanding the caffeine content in matcha can help you make informed choices about your daily caffeine intake. Let’s delve into the details of matcha’s caffeine content.

# Amount Per Serving

Matcha contains a unique form of caffeine known as theanine. This combination provides a calm alertness. A typical serving of matcha is about 1 teaspoon (2 grams) of matcha powder. This serving contains approximately 70 milligrams of caffeine. Here’s a comparison table to understand it better:

|Beverage|Serving Size|Caffeine Content (mg)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Matcha|1 teaspoon (2 grams)|70|
|Regular Coffee|8 ounces|95|

**Key points to remember**:

* Matcha provides sustained energy without jitters.
* Coffee has more caffeine per serving than matcha.
* Matcha’s caffeine is released slowly, giving a longer-lasting effect.

# Factors Affecting Caffeine Levels

The caffeine content in matcha can vary based on several factors. Understanding these factors can help you manage your caffeine intake better.

* **Quality of Matcha**: Higher-grade matcha contains more caffeine. Ceremonial grade has the most caffeine.
* **Amount Used**: The more matcha powder you use, the higher the caffeine content. Use a kitchen scale for precision.
* **Brewing Time**: Longer brewing times can extract more caffeine. But matcha is usually whisked, not steeped.
* **Temperature of Water**: Hotter water can release more caffeine. Matcha is best prepared with hot but not boiling water.
* **Age of Leaves**: Young leaves have more caffeine. Matcha made from young leaves tends to be more potent.

These factors can influence how much caffeine you get from your cup of matcha. By paying attention to these details, you can control your caffeine intake more effectively.



# Caffeine Content In Coffee

Introduction paragraph about How Much Caffeine in Matcha Vs Coffee and Caffeine Content in Coffee…

# Average Caffeine Per Cup

Coffee is a popular beverage known for its stimulating effects, thanks to caffeine. **Caffeine content in coffee** varies, but most cups contain a significant amount. On average, a single 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee has about **95 milligrams of caffeine**.

Different brewing methods can impact the caffeine levels. Here are some examples:

* **Drip coffee:** 95 milligrams per 8-ounce cup
* **Espresso:** 63 milligrams per 1-ounce shot
* **Instant coffee:** 62 milligrams per 8-ounce cup

The type of coffee bean also plays a role. Robusta beans have more caffeine than Arabica beans. This difference can impact the overall caffeine content in your cup.

To summarize:

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine Content (per 8-ounce cup)|
|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee|95 milligrams|
|Espresso|63 milligrams (per 1-ounce shot)|
|Instant Coffee|62 milligrams|

# Variations By Type

Caffeine content in coffee can vary widely based on the type of coffee. Different types include brewed coffee, espresso, instant coffee, and decaf coffee.

**Brewed coffee** is the most common type. It typically has 95 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce cup. **Espresso** has a higher concentration of caffeine but is usually consumed in smaller amounts. A 1-ounce shot of espresso contains about 63 milligrams of caffeine.

**Instant coffee** is made from brewed coffee that has been freeze-dried. It tends to have less caffeine, around 62 milligrams per 8-ounce cup. **Decaffeinated coffee** is a good option for those sensitive to caffeine. Despite the name, it still contains a small amount of caffeine, usually around 2 to 5 milligrams per 8-ounce cup.

To make the differences clearer, here’s a table comparing these types:

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine Content (per 8-ounce cup)|
|:-|:-|
|Brewed Coffee|95 milligrams|
|Espresso|63 milligrams (per 1-ounce shot)|
|Instant Coffee|62 milligrams|
|Decaf Coffee|2-5 milligrams|

These variations show how the type of coffee you choose can impact your caffeine intake. It’s important to consider these differences, especially if you are monitoring your caffeine consumption.

# Comparing Matcha And Coffee

**Matcha** and **coffee** are popular beverages known for their caffeine content. Many people rely on them to kickstart their day. But how do these two compare in terms of caffeine? Let’s explore the differences between matcha and coffee.

# Caffeine Concentration

The caffeine concentration in matcha and coffee varies significantly. Understanding these differences can help you choose the right one for your needs.

**Matcha:** Matcha is a type of powdered green tea. It is unique because you consume the whole tea leaf, not just the brewed water. On average, one gram of matcha contains about 35 milligrams of caffeine. This means a typical serving of matcha tea (about 2 grams) has around 70 milligrams of caffeine.

**Coffee:** Coffee, on the other hand, has a higher caffeine concentration. The average 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 95 milligrams of caffeine. This number can vary based on the type of coffee bean, brewing method, and serving size.

I've always been a casual drug user, mainly psychedelics but also would dabble in pills (addy & clonopin) and things like phenibut, ketamine, etc. The only drugs I've used compulsively/excessively are marijuana, lsd, and now kratom. I used to say I was using it like coffee, but I'd still drink caffeine on top of it. I used it for energy because I do not get good sleep as well as for anxiety. Lately it just puts me back at zero. It doesn't give me energy but makes it so I'm not lethargic from not having taken the kratom. I've been using probably 30-50g daily for around two years. I wanted to quit last week, but I have some important obligations coming up this week that I can't afford to be sick/fucked up mentally through so I've planned to slowly take less throughout the week and stop taking it after Friday. The 15th will be my first day off of kratom. I can't hang out with friends for more than a few hours without needing to cut it short so I can go dose or running off to the bathroom and bring my backpack. It makes my breath stink and stains my fuckin shirt, I carry a nasty ass spoon and cup everywhere I go. I don't look good, I'm only 23 and I look like shit. My eyes are dark, a girl told me I had a sadness in my eyes like I used to be addicted to drugs. There's a recovery group I go too for trauma recovery because I come from a family of addicts and my parents were alcoholics. My brother died from meth OD and my best friend from fentanyl poisoning. Seeing things like that made me feel like taking kratom wasn't a big deal. But if I don't take prozac because I don't wanna be dependent on the pharmacies, why should I be comfortable being dependent on kratom? I have a study abroad coming up in the summer, I can't waste my time abroad figuring out when/how I'm gonna take my kratom. I've been having a hard time letting go, but I need to. 

I would appreciate any reassurance and I'd like to hear your stories if you've been through something similar. I know it's not like a hard drug or anything, my problems has always been with drugs that feel ""safer.""

I asked him to contribute a little bit with bills and and groceries.(it’s been only a month of contribution)

My husband and I likes to sleep in the entertainment room’s couch with our baby sometimes.


Im carpooling with my dad, I got my husband to have his schedule aligned with our schedule to work so he doesn’t have to spend 4 hours in the bus everyday.  Yesterday on the way to work while I was driving, I told him, that he went downstairs so early(6am) and the sound of the boiling water woke us up . We also slept 3am that day because of work tasks at home. My husband and I were very tired. I told him that thinking in my head he would say that he won’t do kitchen stuff that early. Also the kids wake up at 7am by the way so that’s enough time if he wants to grab breakfast or coffee. We leave at 8am. We also have instant hot water that we pay premium every month so I dont understand the necessity to waste electricity to boil a cup. 

Anyway, Im a driver by profession. So I am focused on the road. So while trying to tell him that, I was hoping he would just say he would be mindful next time. He started screaming at me and he was shouting in my ear while I was driving on the 405. He was insisting he didn’t make a single drop of sound.  I was telling him, I personally heard the water hitting the metal kettle and it was too early to be in the kitchen specially if we leave at 8am. He was like “ YOU DIDNT HEAR ANYTHING! I DIDNT MAKE A SOUND , YOURE HUSBAND WOKE UP BEFORE I BOILED THE WATER” 

My husband also said he woke up because of his footsteps and noise in the kitchen. 

I was telling my dad that you can’t dictate what people heard. You can defend yourself but you cant tell me or anyone what they heard or did not hear. You are not in any person’s body. The way you are reacting right now screaming isn’t proper and not a reaction of a mature individual. This is not how you deal with a discussion. 

Oh by the way, he was accusing me of yelling, I wasn’t how can I yell if Im driving trying to avoid all the traffic and craziness of WA drivers on a rush hour. I needed all my energy on the road. 

He was repeating himself constantly to the maximum capacity of his loudness. I was still focused because Im about to go to the right lane from the HOV to exit 14. (About 5 lanes)  . He was still yelling, while I was telling him to calm down and stop screaming. He hit my dashboard so hard and I got startled . I had to slammed my brakes almost hitting the wall and 3 cars on my tail, one car was 2 to 3 inches from hitting us. I was just shocked and needed a literal minute. Mind you, he didn’t stop screaming at me. I was telling him you almost killed us and my unborn baby and other people because of your attitude. But he didn’t stop yelling. He was a monster. I wanna kick him out of my car. But I still drop him off his job. Didnt stop yelling even when he   Slammed my car door so hard. 

I was on FaceTime with my mom while she was watching my kids telling her the scariest experience of my life. I told my coworkers I cant face our students for few minutes because I need to calm and distract myself first. I was literally shaking. 

Anyway, I didn’t pick him up, i dont even know if I can forgive him . Not right now. Now he is back to spending 4 hours on the bus plus walking compared to 1 hour in the car at zero $$. 
I dont think I wanna commute with him anymore. Id rather not have the HOV privileges than have him in my car.

Ever find yourself staring at that endless to-do list, coffee in hand, wondering if you’ll ever find those mythical 25 hours in a day? **Spoiler alert:** You don’t need them! 

So, here’s a thought: what if we could snag an extra **10 hours a week** without summoning a time machine? Let’s chat about two superpowers you already have: **Daily Habit Stacking** and **good old-fashioned Calendars**. But there’s a twist! 🤔

First up, **Habit Stacking**. You know that thing you do every morning without even thinking? Like making coffee or brushing your teeth? 💡 What if you piggybacked another mini habit onto that? James Clear talks about this in ""Atomic Habits"" — it’s brilliant because you’re already on autopilot. No extra willpower required! 

- **Example:** While you wait for your coffee to brew, sneak in 5 minutes of stretching. Voilà, daily exercise done before you even sip that sweet caffeine goodness!

But, here’s the curveball – **Calendars**, yeah, those things just sitting there, waiting patiently to be your productivity BFF. They’re not just for meetings, folks! 📆 

- **Reality Check:** Ever notice how time slots on your calendar make things feel... official? Turns out, scheduling mundane things like “mindful break” or “quick journaling” magically transforms them from ‘meh’ tasks into command performances you actually SHOW UP to. 📈

So, which approach gives you more bang for your mental buck? Or is there a sweet spot balancing both? 🤔

Here’s my take: **Combine them for maximum efficiency**. Pair the *effortless* flow of habit stacking with the *structured promise* of a calendar. Use your calendar to block dedicated time for habit-stacking routines. Trust me, it shifts you from “Who has the time?” to “Oh look, there’s time!”.

Some folks are team habit-stackers, others calendar champions. Personally, I think there’s a beautiful harmony between the two. What’s your hack? Are you blending, optimizing, or do you have a wildcard up your sleeve? Share your wisdom (or your epic fails), friends! After all, every genius idea was a work in progress.

Dating, hookups, even the thought of flirting—it all felt like a past life. Work and working out kept me occupied, and I had settled into a phase where romance simply didn’t exist.

That night, I found myself at an exclusive movie screening, not because I particularly wanted to be there, but because I had been invited. The film wasn’t exactly gripping. It was way too artsy fartsy for me and I doubt I was alone. 

Then, I noticed her.

She was in her 30s most likely, wearing a tiny white dress that clung to her in a way that made it impossible not to notice. A cascade of long hair framed her face, and when she turned, I saw the ink on her back—an intricate tattoo that made me curious about the story behind it. She was here alone, like me, and while we exchanged a few words about having friends in common on instagram, there was no immediate spark. In fact, I barely even considered the possibility.

I had grown so accustomed to a life devoid of flirtation that I no longer even looked for signs.

As the screening wrapped up and people started filtering out, she turned to me and asked, “Do you have a doobie?”

Of course, I had one. I always had one. Thinking back the only way she would have known this is through my insta. 

“Yeah,” I said, “but I gotta roll it first.”

“Let’s go to mine,” she replied, completely unfazed.

Nothing about this felt out of the ordinary. I had been to countless acquaintances’ places to chill, roll up, and shoot the shit. No big deal. Her apartment was tiny—a one-room box that barely contained her life. She was grinding, trying to carve out a career in the city, and living like most people do when they’re chasing something bigger.

We spent the next couple of hours lost in the usual stoner banter—deep, ridiculous, hilarious conversations that felt important in the moment but would probably evaporate by morning. The vibe was good, but I wasn’t reading into it. I was just there, enjoying the night, expecting nothing.

At some point, I stood up to leave.

I walked to the door, turned to say goodbye, and that awkward social hesitation kicked in. The one where you’re not sure if you’re supposed to shake hands, fist bump, side hug, or just nod and walk out.

She saved me the trouble.

She stepped in and wrapped her arms around me. A real hug. Not the casual, distant, barely-there side hug that women give when they’re just being polite. This was different. It lingered.

I could hear her heartbeat.

And suddenly, I could feel my own.

Something shifted in the air. The silence thickened. The world outside her apartment ceased to exist. I could feel the warmth of her body, the rise and fall of her breath. My hands, almost on their own, began moving down the smooth curve of her back.

She was shaking. Or was it me?

For a split second, my brain scrambled to process what was happening.

Could she actually be into me? Like, sexually?

And then—oh.

I felt the switch flip.

I knew.

This was game on. All I had to do was take control.

And I did.

What followed was two hours of intensity, of heat, of raw, unfiltered pleasure. I won’t get too graphic (even though, trust me, I could), but let’s just say that by the time I finally left, I had a grin so wide it probably looked like I had won the lottery.

It’s been 4 years since that night, and damn… I still haven’t forgotten it. We had a chat the next day and planned to meet again after she returned from a trip and we did but just for a coffee where she confessed she was seeing someone and it was serious.

He took a long, hard look at the box and decided not to. Then he made an appointment to see Dr Sinha.

Monday afternoon, he put the half empty pillbox on her desk and confessed that he'd stopped taking his medication. ""Any particular reason?"" she asked.

""I'm not sleeping well.""

""Maybe I need to up the dosage.""

""No, *s*leeping - I'm not sleeping well... and I'm having very strange dreams.""

""Strange how?""

""Really vivid, often lucid, remarkably convoluted.""

""Sounds like fun... Sorry, I didn't sleep much myself last night and I've had a hell of a morning - it's nice to see my favourite super-looper, though. What about the symptoms you mentioned last time, any improvement?""

""I'm still stressed... and I'm still paranoid.""

""The CCTV cameras? and the... what do you call them?""

""Zephyrs - there was one in the waiting room. I had to look through the window and wait for him to turn around before I could open the door. There's helicopters too, now. Sometimes I hear them but I can't see them, but when I do they're always black - like flying shadows.""

""Maybe I need to lower the dosage - it's all about finding the right balance. Let me ask you this - do you think the world revolves around you?""

""Now you come to mention it. It's like... before I was arrested I wasn't really connected to the outside world much, but now it's almost like everything is somehow connected to me. But I know I'm not special, if that's what you're thinking.""

""Of course you are.""

""You mean we all are.""

""No, that's just a paradoxical platitude. What I mean is - we all live in our own individual subjective universe that nobody else shares. How can you not be special when reality is experientially divided into you and everything else? Though a fundamental part of the relationship we build with our environment, this specialness doesn't effect human behaviour as much as you might think. It's always there in the background but, for those of us who are able to leap *and* loop, it doesn't define us. For those on the edge, though, specialness is... special. For many non-loopers, it's so central to their experience of the universe that it's taken for granted. Their whole lives revolve around the idea that they exist to fulfil a purpose and the traditional way to manage that is to outsource its cause to a deity. In most cases, it's a humble and charitable purpose, and they're some of the nicest people you'll ever meet, and make significant contributions to society - even if their ethical positions don't always match the prevailing zeitgeist. Of course, there are those narcissistic super-leapers who believe God has a particularly special, often eschatological, plan for them that usually, and purely coincidentally, involves some form of ethnic cleansing.""

""Or they believe that they *are* God,"" said K. ""Is that what would happen if I overdosed on these pills?""

""Let's not find out. Apart from the weird dreams, do you think they've had any other effect on you?""

""Morning glory... maybe... I generally seem to be acting on instincts more than I used to.""

""How's that going?""

""Swings and roundabouts.""

""For example?"" K wondered if she wanted to hear about him discovering a plot to kill his lawyer that turned out to be bad instincts, or believing the ex-policeman's story about the cover-up of a violent assault by a member of parliament that turned out to be good instincts... and whether she had any other appointments that afternoon.

""For example, I instinctively used the term 'swings and roundabouts' just now and I'm already regretting it.""

""I think we talked about your use of humour last time, didn't we?""

""Sorry... I've been leaping to conclusions and making false connections between things - isn't that a symptom of paranoia?""

""It can be. Are there any other differences you've noticed since taking the pills?""

""Just a vague feeling of... metamorphosis... like I'm no longer...""

""...a monkey? I wouldn't worry about that - we're constantly changing under the stresses and strains of life, and you've had more lately than you've previously been used to. As for these 'false connections' you don't want to talk about, what if they weren't a symptom of your paranoia but a contributing factor?... Let's try a wee thought experiment,"" she took a sip of water. ""Imagine an average man. He gets home from his average job one average day, enters his average home, kisses his average wife... or average husband - well if it's average, I guess it would be both, or neither, or whatever the average person identifies as on any given day... greets his two point four average kids, makes himself an average cup of coffee... or an average cup of tea, or some horrible hybrid hot drink, or maybe he has a cold drink from the fridge - the carbonated, processed juice of some super-cultivated superfruit, perhaps... or maybe...""

""Doc! I get it... it would be slightly dirty water though, if you think about it.""

""Before he can enjoy his average evening, his average phone pings, but this isn't an average text message. Out of everyone on the planet, he's been randomly selected to be the first person to walk on Mars. After the shock wears off, and after he's ruled out the possibility of one of his average mates playing a prank, what's his reaction?""

""Fuck that, I'm enjoying my average life too much?""

""Let's just assume he's a massive *Star Trek* fan.""

""*Original Series* or *Next Generation*?""

""*Deep Space Nine*.""

""He's far from average, then.""

""I see what you mean about those instincts, now.""

""Sorry, go on. You have my full attention.""

""He says - 'Wow! This is a dream come true, I can't believe this is happening to me, I'm so lucky'. Now, what if he's a super-leaper? Then he says - 'I knew something like this was going to happen, I totally deserve this, I always knew I was destined for greatness'. But what if he's a super-looper? Then he says - 'This doesn't make sense, why is this happening to me when there are seven billion other people on the planet? Nobody's that lucky'. Given that reality is experientially divided into him and everything else, it's become more rational to assume that he's the only conscious entity in a simulated universe - a guinea pig in some super-intelligent alien's experiment. What happened to him was so improbable that the only place to loop was beyond the random event horizon to where his specialness had been hiding. It's a logical black hole from which there's no escape because the only thing that can travel faster than the speed of loop is a leap. It's an extreme example, but the point is that paranoia isn't always the result of irrational thought, it can also stem from the limits of rational thought. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to, but there's clearly been a lot going on in your life lately, and you're struggling to make rational sense of it all. These connections you've been making are not you 'leaping to conclusions' because you're paranoid - you describe them as 'false' for a start, which you wouldn't do if you were delusional. They're just temporary loops. They're just tools to aid you in your attempts to make sense of it all. Once you have all the information, or accept that you never will, they'll either be replaced with permanent loops or you'll blissfully embrace ignorance in this matter and move on. All I can tell you is that it's nothing to do with the leaping pills.""

""How can you be sure?""

""Because there's no such thing as leaping pills, it's just some prazosin for the stress. Sorry, but I had to be sure you were a genuine non-leaper before I make my report to the academy.""

""A report about *me*? I'm your guinea pig and you're my super-intelligent alien?""

""Stop looping to conclusions, it's not about you, it's about my groundbreaking discovery of nihilism.""

""Discovery? I thought it was more of a rebranding.""

""Oh, please don't say that, it sounds like marketing. Anyway, it's more of a redefining, but let's not get into semantics. The point is, it's a new neurodevelopmental disorder, and I need you to help me market it.""

""You're not going to stick me on a poster, are you? It was bad enough having my picture in the paper, I don't want to see my own face staring at me while I'm waiting for a bus.""

""That Pearl Goolie article didn't help your case much, then? That doesn't surprise me. What a load of self-serving, virtue-signalling shit that was. She never contacted me for a quote and didn't once mention my name. Now I've got to rush my paper out before some charlatan steals my idea. I won't be voting for her, I can tell you that much... But, since she's already made you the face of clinical nihilism, why don't you let me use you as a case study?""

""Will it help *my* case?""

""Medical facts will help a lot more than political posturing.""

""Still, it might be a good idea if I keep a low profile.""

""It's a research paper not a fashion magazine. It's not going to be on the shelf in the newsagents, you're not going to be famous, you're not going to have the paparazzi following you around and desperate fans hounding you for your autograph... They'll be no pictures and your name won't even be in it - we always use pseudonyms for case studies.""

""Like George Orwell?""

""Like Oliver Sacks.""

""What's *his* real name?""

""Like in his books - a common forename and a single letter, no one will know it's you, I promise... What are your instincts telling you?""

""That for a doctor-patient relationship, this it starting to feel a little lob-sided.""

""I am trying to help you, Joe. I'd like to try you on hydrocortisone, it might be a wee bit more effective and reduce some of the... side effects. Also, there's a mindfulness session at the leisure centre down the road, on Friday evenings - just give them my name and the NHS will cover it. It's mainly nine-to-fivers winding down before the weekend but I think you should try it. I've meditated all my life and it certainly helps me.""

""I will... thanks, I feel like one of your normal patients now, but... I am your favourite super-looper, aren't I?""

""I didn't know you were such a tough negotiator.""

""I've recently learnt from the best.""

""OK, you can drop in anytime you want, no appointment necessary... and I'll give you my personal mobile number... anything else?""

""The by-election. I can't help feeling that we should both put our personal grievances aside and think about what's best for Glowbridge.""

""Then I'll vote for Goolie.""

""Then I'll be your case study for clinical nihilism.""

""Sinha's Syndrome.""

""Sinha's Syndrome? That's what your calling it?""

""Well, I'm testing the waters at the moment but, if that's what people start calling it, it might stick - what do you think?""

""I think it sounds more like hereditary Catholicism than clinical nihilism... And the alliteration's a bit...""

""I *like* alliteration. Any more constructive criticism while you're at it?""

""Well, that loopy leapy business doesn't sound very scientific either, I wouldn't put that in your research paper.""

""Of course not... I'm saving that for my book.""

""Book, huh? I hope I get a good character arc... and a signed copy.""

""Only if you promise not to sell it. Which reminds me, have you spoken to Broker lately?""

""No... why do you ask?""

""I tried to call him over the weekend but his phone was off, which is very unusual for a journalist. He'd left me a message asking if I'd like to buy his Chola Ganesh, as if I could afford something like that.""

Conscious, unconscious or semi-conscious, he couldn't get any peace. Dragging himself out of bed, it became obvious that, after ten hours of sleep, he was even more groggy than he'd been when Womble and Wire has roused him from the couch the night before.

Here's a ranked list of changes you can make to reduce microplastic consumption, ordered by effectiveness and ease of implementation:

Most Effective & Easiest to Implement

1. Drink filtered tap water – Use a high-quality water filter (e.g., reverse osmosis, activated carbon).


2. Avoid bottled water – Bottled water has high levels of microplastics.


3. Use glass or stainless steel containers – Avoid plastic food storage.


4. Minimize plastic-packaged foods – Opt for fresh produce and bulk items.


5. Use reusable cloth bags instead of plastic bags – Reduces exposure and waste.


6. Do not microwave food in plastic containers – Heat releases microplastics into food.


7. Avoid chewing gum – Many gums contain synthetic plastics.


8. Choose natural fiber clothing (cotton, wool, linen, hemp) – Synthetic fabrics shed microplastics.


9. Use a lint filter in your washing machine – Captures synthetic fiber microplastics.


10. Use a HEPA filter in your vacuum cleaner – Reduces airborne microplastic dust.


11. Opt for bar soap and shampoo bars – Avoids plastic packaging and microbeads.


12. Avoid disposable plastic cutlery and plates – Use reusable options.


13. Store food in glass or stainless steel rather than plastic – Reduces leaching.


14. Use wooden or metal cooking utensils – Avoids plastic exposure during cooking.



Very Effective & Moderately Easy

15. Avoid seafood with high microplastic contamination – Filter feeders (e.g., shellfish) contain more microplastics.


16. Reduce synthetic fabric clothing purchases – Choose sustainable, natural options.


17. Wash synthetic clothes less frequently and with cold water – Reduces fiber shedding.


18. Hang-dry clothes instead of using a dryer – Prevents microplastics from becoming airborne.


19. Choose loose tea over tea bags – Some tea bags release microplastics.


20. Reduce intake of processed foods – Often contain plastic contaminants.


21. Use glass or ceramic coffee cups instead of plastic lids – Reduces plastic contact with hot beverages.


22. Avoid fast food packaging – Many wrappers contain microplastics.


23. Cook at home more often – Reduces plastic exposure from takeout and processed food.


24. Buy bulk food in paper or glass packaging – Minimizes plastic contamination.


25. Use bamboo or silicone baby bottles – Plastic baby bottles shed microplastics.


26. Avoid cosmetics with microplastics (look for ""polyethylene"" in ingredients) – Found in some exfoliants and toothpaste.


27. Use metal razors instead of plastic disposable razors – Reduces plastic waste.


28. Avoid plastic-wrapped produce – Choose unpackaged fruits and vegetables.



Helpful but Harder to Implement

29. Install a whole-house water filtration system – Filters out microplastics from all water sources.


30. Buy a washing machine with a built-in microfiber filter – Some models now offer this.


31. Use ceramic or cast-iron cookware instead of non-stick pans – Some coatings release microplastics.


32. Switch to 100% plastic-free personal care products – Including toothbrushes and floss.


33. Reduce synthetic carpets and furniture – Choose wool, cotton, or wood options.


34. Advocate for plastic regulations and bans – Reduces overall plastic pollution.


35. Grow your own food – Minimizes microplastic exposure from soil contamination.


36. Use cloth diapers instead of disposable plastic ones – Reduces exposure for babies.


37. Choose public transportation or walking over cars – Tire wear releases microplastics.


38. Avoid artificial turf sports fields – They shed microplastic particles.


39. Limit salt consumption – Many table salts contain microplastic contamination.


40. Support brands with plastic-free packaging – Helps drive demand for alternatives.

1j71om6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1j71om6/dae_struggle_in_relationships_with_selfish_family/,DAE struggle in relationships with selfish family members?,"Background: My husband and I help family out when we can. Right now, we are struggling financially and family members we have helped in the past do not want to help us. They are my father and brother, so these aren't some distant relatives. I am now actively looking for work but it could take a few months to get a job. My husband and I are trying to start a business, and need 15-20k (already have 350k towards it with a strong business plan). We have a curious toddler who wants to ""play"" on the computer, too, when I want to apply/resume prep so it's not easy. 

My father used to borrow babysitting money from me when I was a child (14-18) and borrowed money from my sister until about 12 years ago. He never returned the favor to either of us, except for once he loaned me $400 to cover my brother's portion of rent. 

My brother is even worse because my husband and I let him live with us for a minimal amount (we couldn't afford to have them stay with us for free). I also cosigned a credit card for his wife so she could be eligible for enough student loans to complete her bachelor's degree. 

My dad offered to cosign a HELOC (he brought it up) then backed out at the last moment. He has over 250k in savings, but won't lend us any, except maybe 1-2k. I recently asked when some unexpected costs came up and my husband and I had exhausted all other resources.

Recently, my brother got a job offer for 180k/yr (up to 250k/yr total compensation). He offered to loan us money. We told him we don't need a loan, just a HELOC cosigner (40k) and that I would then remove his name from as soon as I get a job.He says he wants to help us. We would even give/loan him 10k of our HELOC for his wife's fertility treatments. He said he wasn't comfortable with co-signing due to the business type, etc. and that we need 180k more not 20-40k more. He also said that he didn't want to force us to sell the home if he needed to get his name off our HELOC earlier than we were able to. I told him the HELOC was separate from the business, but he said it wasn't in his eyes. Needless to say, I am not comfortable with him co-signing now. 

I almost had a meltdown on the phone, so I got off the phone and then didn't answer his calls. The next day, he wants to talk to me about a proposition. 

Since I didn't call him back, he took the liberty of contacting a friend of his who would be willing to sell his collectibles to give us 6k now, and my brother would give us a free place to stay by renting a 5BR, 3BA home where his wife could be a nanny for my husband and I unless she was undergoing fertility treatments. That way, we could use the equity in our home after selling it to pay for any business expenses. 

I told him I felt he was trying to control my life and I wasn't interested in that. All we had asked him for was to cosign a HELOC and he said no. Then, he tried to flip it, asking more business questions and all of a sudden, he's okay with helping us. He also asked if we could up the HELOC from 40k to 120k so he could pay for all his wife's IVF procedures with our HELOC. I politely said no. I am fairly certain he didn't want to do the HELOC for us until he realized his wife's fertility treatments were going to have roughly double or more the interest rate when compared to a HELOC. I would have outright told him no but I didn't want to listen to him argue, etc. 

My husband now wants nothing to do with my brother because my brother told us to sell our home and is more or less trying to use us when we've helped them in the past. 

I want to say so much more to my brother, but I don't want to end up having a meltdown. 

For the record,we have tenants who cover our mortgage so our living costs are already minimal. We live down the street from our business vs. where my brother would want to rent (about 1 hr away).

I would simply not speak to my brother again but I love my mom and we are good friends. My mom has always spoiled my brother more than me or my sister. She has financially supported my brother multiple times. He has never paid her back, and will continue to eat out and get coffee multiple times daily even when borrowing money from others because he knows the money will always be there. That's ultimately between them, though.

Also, when I was past my due date with my child and my brother was making 90k/yr, he didn't have $400 to loan my mom. I had to deal with the additional stress of that at a time when I was trying to relax to push my body into labor. I ended up needing an emergency C-section and only my mom came out to help me. My brother was working remote at the time, and his wife doesn't work. I was also the one who stayed with my mom when my stepdad passed away.

The main reason my brother is giving us for not being able to help us more is because he needs to pay for IVF for his wife. He didn't have a strong need for a child until I got pregnant. Now, it feels like they are trying to force it ASAP. I get age is definitely a factor, but still. We only need assistance for 2-3 months, that's it. 

How do I handle this? I don't want to be around my brother, but until he gets settled out here, he's going to keep calling because he wants to keep his options open in terms of a place to stay. My husband already said he can't stay with us after this last issue. 

How do you deal with family members who you will continue to see at family gatherings who not only want to use you but also want to see you fail?

When you are flying standby for private reasons no duty trip and wear your Airline ID, do you introduce yourself to the purser when getting to the plane and say where you are seated?

A flight attendant was giving me this beautiful „hint“ to introduce me and say where I am sitting, like „things are done in this way“. They would give me coffee, snacks etc. free of charge when done this way.

I would feel so uncomfortable doing this, as I would be something special and expect some special service. I thought the staff already knows that there are some standby passengers and when I’m wearing my ID it shows that I’m standby. 
Sometimes I’m getting coffee free of charge but I won’t introduce me for that, I don’t expect that from the cabin crew. When they are so nice and do that okay, when not than it’s also okay.

Heey Mackie hereI attended a company event last week, and it was an absolute blast because the theme was 'clubbing.' To be honest, I've only been to a club twice in my life, and I usually just stand at the corner, too shy to join the fun. But now, I’m feeling adventurous and ready to step out of my comfort zone. I'd love to go out and hang out with someone, even if it's just for a coffee or dinner date. I'm still in a party-raving mood tonight, haha!

I'm single and looking to do something fun and relaxing, while having a great conversation with someone I can vibe well with. If things go well later, who knows where the night could lead? (You know what I mean!) To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of endless texting because I want to practice my conversational skills. That's why I'd really prefer meetups for this.

About me:  
\- Valenzuela born and raised  
\- 5’5. My BMI said I'm considered overweight, but I assure you I'm not on the chubby side (check out my pics). I stay active by playing sports and jogging every weekend to maintain my weight.  
\- I wear glasses and don't have a beard or mustache.  
\- Chinito (I do look like chinese daw).  
\- Tbh, I can rate myself 7-8, but you be the judge of that coz I know its subjective.  
\- Techie, into stand-up comedy, games, movies, and some anime  
\- Ambivert  
\- Loves physical interaction (e.g. hh, cuddles, kissing foreheads, tapping and stroking my girl's head.)  
\- Although I have a car, I do travel by my motorcycle (ayokong maipit sa traffic!)

About you:  
\- 20-35  
\- Can be shorter or taller than me. i dont mind at all  
\- Any vert is welcome (intro,ambi,extro). I can adapt to anything.  
\- It's a plus if you wear glasses too. But if not, that's okay! I'll lend you mine. Just kidding! Everyone is welcome.  
\- Can be from petite to chubby side but not a plus size (sorry 😕)

1j71lz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1j71lz4/coffee_date_tayo/,“Coffee Date tayo”,"I’ve met this girl in college, first day of school after pandemic. She was this shy type, I was the bubbly and OA one. I’ve approached her first because I want to befriend her. 1 yr passed, we’ve become really close, she opened up her struggles so as me. I’ve come to know na hindi pala sya nakakasama sa galaan ng classmates or friends nya no’ng una because of how strict her parents was. Me, as a bida bida friend, nagpakilala ako sa parents niya. Her parents knew me, but still hindi sya pinayagan if we have outing outside the city kahit nagpapa alam kami ng maayus (we understand because she has this health condition sa heart) that’s why sa city kami gumagala. 

She has this pure heart huhu very soft hearted ang beshy ko na yan, sabi ko “bhie, gala tayo sa mall maghanap tayo ng magandang spot na kainan” if this girl was a magastos she would probably agree with me right away but alam niyo ano sabi nya? “sorry, wala akong pera nahihiya kasi ako manghingi sa parents ko kakahingi ko lang kasi pambili ng libro sa medsurg” I was in awe, because of her mindset. Take note, her parents could provide all her wants if she wanted to, she was also the princess of her brother who’s in 🚢. I was like “okay girl, meron naman akong ipon dito tara kain tayo” well, I am not a daughter of rich rich okay? I was in lower-middle class lang po, 1 k lang weekly allowance at di rin naman ako magastos, nakapag ipon naman due to my printing services (student friendly) free yan sya sa akin, friends privileges HAHAHA nahihiya pa yan sha  kasi mostly kapag nagkikita kami ako nagbabayad ng foods nya alam ko naman kasing nahihiya siyang gastusin ang perang bigay ng parents nya unless it’s school related. 
 
FF: nag review for board exam kami, ako lang yung pinagkatiwalaan ng parents niya at magkasama kami sa dorm. It was like 7 hrs drive from our city. Alam niyo yung nonchalant friend and the OA One? Ako yung OA HAHAHA kaya always akong strict sa pagkain niya na kahit coffeee di talaga yan sya nakakainom, palagi ko rin siyang ni reremind na “don’t be too happy nor be too sad” protect your heart. Girl, si atemmooo my boy crush pa sa review center and when they interacted sobrang happy niya tapos pag alis nong boy she was like “my heart hurts (literally) but happy ko so much” 🤨 gusto ko syang sabunutan talaga HAHAHAHA ni remind ko na syang wag masyadong matuwa huhu muntik ko ng dalhin sa ER eh buti always kong chene-check if andon ba mga medications niya sa kit. Anyway skl, we both passed PNLE and we’re now in working era in different hospitals. 

So, this past few weeks di na kami nagkikita because of workloads. I asked her, “when is your off? Coffee tayo, but decaffeinated sayo”HAHAHA she declined 💀I was hurt you know? Dalawa nalang silang tinuturing kong friend huhu nagtampo agad si OA HAHAHA  Pero you know what’s the twist? I’ve come to know her reason why she declined 🫶🏻

She recently sent me a message that really touched me. She said that once she receives her first salary, we’ll finally have a coffee date where she can treat me. It felt so thoughtful and meaningful, especially since for the longest time, I’ve been the one paying for our food trips.  She’s always been so grateful, but knowing she wants to show her appreciation in this way just made me smile. It’s not just about the gesture of paying—it’s about how our relationship has always been built on care, trust, and mutual support. I’ve always been happy to treat her, but the fact that she wants to return the favor shows how much she values me. I can’t wait for that day to come, as it will not only be a celebration of her hard work but also of how far our friendship has come.

To my nonchalant friend: I’ll never get tired on reminding you to drink your meds and avoid those bawal. I’ll pray always for your safety including na sana you will find a man who’s gonna value your principles in life. 

Di pako pwedeng mamatay, di ko pa na claim free coffee ko from her😆

I haven't changed my lifestyle other than cutting calories and working out more recently and I have lost 15 pounds since Thanksgiving. But that's it! I am a non drinker, non smoker, and I don't even drink coffee or caffeine! 

4 days ago, I started having this burning in my throat as I was falling asleep. I had eaten chicken and rice for dinner. I went downstairs and started drinking some tea, took a Tums, and frantically googled what it could be. Since that moment, it has LITERALLY only gotten worse. I have taken Tums, Aloe vera juice, omeprazole, today I was prescribed pantoprazole and started that, mylanta all in the last 4 days and nothing is touching it. The only thing that even touches the pain is Tylenol at the max dose. 

Since it started, my lower rib area and chest and throat have had either a consistent ""low"" burning feeling or a sharp sharp stabbing burning that will sort of come up and go down. The pain is so bad it is radiating in my teeth and ears and head. I went to urgent care today finally after debating about going to the ER a bunch. They basically said 'yeah it sounds like acid reflux but we really don't know.' My blood pressure was really low, but that is likely because I CANT EAT anything!!!! It hurts so bad to swallow and feels like my throat is tight and just won't let anything go down. I can barely sleep and I am sitting up straight to sleep. Still barely helps. I also started having diarrhea yesterday so that's been another indicator of something GI related.

So my question is- every time I look at posts about GERD the people talk about a long life history of heartburn and acid. I do not have that! What could be causing this acute sort of attack? Can this happen? Why is medicine not helping???",1,1741501813.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

Context - 9 months ago (almost to the date), I had a brief one week fling with a guy I met on hinge. Instant connection, amazing dates, everything was great. I remember him not being the best texter but I always enjoyed talking to him. In the one-ish week we were seeing eachother, we had one sleepover on our first date (didn't go all the way...), then drinks on the beach and dinner for the second, and a walk and spontaneous visit to a jazz bar for the third. This week was leading up to his grad school graduation weekend and my birthday the following week. His family was coming into town the first half of the week, then my brother was coming into the second half of the week, so we were on the same page that we wouldn't be seeing each other. After the week had passed, we met up for a walk where we left having plans to hang out later in the week. On Tuesday or Wednesday I asked if that was still the plan. He never responded. 

I remember being hurt by it but also realistic about it. He was moving back to the country he is from in three weeks. He would say how our connection was so strong etc. And said he'd visit me once he moved away, but I never took him seriously and was fully under the impression that he was exaggerating. Therefore, I was kind of numb to the ghosting and eventually moved on. Reflecting back on it I think my main emotion was disappointment. 

Last Thursday, 9 months later, he texted me apologizing. Saying he's sorry because he ""was so scared"". That he was feeling so much and he was leaving so soon. Then followed up by saying he will be in town this week and he would love to talk to me at least one more time. 

I agreed and we are meeting tomorrow for coffee. Questions I have are for our convo: 1) why now, 9 months later? 2) what is your goal for this meetup? 3) why couldn't he just end it and tell me he was scared back then?

I’ve been a diehard Madewell fan since about 2013 but I’m getting pretty fed up. There hasn’t been anything interesting in years at this point and I just don’t see the brand going in a direction that will keep my interest. I’ve been squeaking out a few sweaters or tops every season, but my wardrobe is a few years old overall.

I know a lot of people feel the same way where are some places you have moved onto I don’t even know where to start anymore. Preferably places that have extended sizing 16+!",4,1741501456.0,Madewell,6,1.0,False

Well basically a lot of people found it funny and wanted me to continue, so here is weird somali people A to Z (this list will include the first couple letters from my original) 

Person A: Qabilism is the reason somalia is failing. (Not the only reason, also qabil is inherently a bad thing)

Person B: No actually qabilism is the best thing that has happened. (No, it's one of the main reasons the civil war happened and to a certain degree why it's still happening)

Person C: SOMALIA WILL ACHIEVE WORLD
DOMINATION (I'm being so fr, I was telling this guy that Somalia got too many issues for world domination, we can't even dominate our own land, this guy was seriously saying we will dominate the world.)

Person D: I hate somalia, I hate being somali, I'm so ashamed to tell people I'm from such a stupid and horrible failed state ect ect. (Self deprecation at its worst)

Person E: imma spend this entire ramadan praying that he will become my soul mate (not a somali girl problem only, I can argue that a strong % of young women think like this sadly)

Person F: We need all these different fractions to go and have a battle royal to end the civil war (what do you think they are trying to do???)

Person G: If your not Muslim you're not a somali (as a proud Muslim alhamduillah I'm sorry to tell you that that's not how the DNA works, also this is a popular take on tiktok)

Person H: Where is somalia anyways and why should I care, I live in the west. (Thank you for telling the entire world that you are a clueless idiot)

Person I: WE ARE ARABS (Girl you speak better Korean then somali, and you don't know a lick of Arabic, Arab where?)

(This is the start of part 2)

Person J: *constantly uses the N word and other somali words like Jareér to the point even non somalis be using it towards other people*  (please stop teaching ajnabis our language, because it isn't genuine, it's just insults)

Person K: My qabil is the bestest and strongest and my clan state has the most legitimacy (honey I will hold your hand, it's never that deep)

Person L: Im not african I promise, I'm not black, I'm Somali, stop saying I'm like those jareér african people (sit down and speed dial a local geography secondary school teacher, and whatever the name for a scientist that specialise in DNA and ancestry is)

Person M: How dare somali women marry outside of our culture, I don't care if the guy is Muslim, SHE CAN ONLY MARRY US. But yeah i would definitely marry an cadaan woman, she can be Christian shes the people of the book. (Again, honey, I will hold your hand when I say this, it's never that deep, free will is a thing, also in the quran it states in Surah Al Hujurut (49:13): “O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other), so get over it, let her marry her darkskin west african man xx)

Person N: *consumes so much K dramas and K pop that they can speak Korean fluently, but is a hoyoo matalo kid* (atp get a job, or a hobby or maybe, JUST MAYBE learn your own language and culture instead of trying to forcibly consume that media and become a walking indo yare while stuttering to reply to an auntie asking me how's life, same goes to the anime kids, no leave me alone, I will not watch anime, I rather watch arcane or somali dramas with my mom)

Person O: IM SO LONELY AND SAD AND I JUST WANNA GET MARRIED (boo, you're most likely below the age where your frontal lobes have fully developed, you do not need a man that desperate, if you are in a difficult situation with your family and it's financially reasonable, move out for the love of God, do not put urself from one bad situation to another. Before the hate comes, yes in islam it's encouraged to marry young, but in a clear state of mind, which sadly these women are not)

Person P: I hate Islam, it's so oppressive and harsh and full of hate. (Divide culture and religion, and even then if it's not the religion u wanna follow, MOVE ON)

Person Q: *that one auntie that keeps trying to set you up with her failure of a son she babied and is not expecting his wife to become mom 2.0* (No, I don't wanna get married, I'm not trying to make your son single for the rest of his life, he's doing that well on his own)

Person R: My life is soooo hard, I grew up on the streets, the streets raised me. (No, you grew up with both parents present, with a roof over ur head, food on the table, clothes on your back and a mother that babied you due to her love and care. Ur not hard.)

Person S: Hoyoo matalo (do I need to say anything more?)

Person T: I want my wife to be obedient, cooked 3 times a day, willing to have 20 kids i will have no part in raising, happy for me to get up my 4 wife's that Allah gave me the right to, doesn't work, doesn't leave the house, doesn't have friends, only speaks to her dad, and is conventionally attractive and will never say no to me. (No.)

Person U: I support trump (real question is does trump support you? Or is he actively deporting our people and starting ww3?)

Person V: Women should not be on social media (oh so that ur fyp is only kafir women who wear the smallest amount of clothes that somehow society deemed acceptable? Na rather not, if you want a platform for men by men, go to corn, not social media)

Person W: that one uncle that keeps talking to me about how he knows my dad (even tho I truly couldn't care less, ik u spend all ur day in coffee shops that's why u keep knowing all these people besides your own kids)

Person X: *the people that ever went to a suhoor fest or even thought about going*

Person Y: I don't care about qabils, but mine is still the best (no, mine is get it straight)

Person Z: I am so happy i live in the west, I couldn't never imagine living back home or in a Muslim country. (U don't acknowledge ur privilege but you mention other people's misfortune back home, get a grip on reality pls I don't think I can handle all that ego and self rigousness ousing out of you)

I hope you had fun becuase it was a nightmare typing this all out.

1j71fc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1j71fc5/the_guy_i_have_been_dating_is_married_and_he_said/,"The guy I have been dating is married and he said he wanted me as a side chick because I am inferior to him, unlike his wife","I have been working near an airport for the last year and a half. Flight crews often showed up at the coffee shop. Most of the pilots flirted with me. If I found them attractive I flirted back. Although many were clearly married (they had the ring) they tried to get my number. These were also the guys I always rejected. I agreed to go on a first date with one. A bit older, in his early 30s. I searched him on social media, he actually had a girlfriend. I blocked him. After a couple weeks I started talking to another one. He was 38, so ten years older than me, a captain. Very handsome and charming. He seems honest. He said he has a 2 years old daughter but he is not married to her mother, just pays child support and they communicate strictly about the kid. 

Months went by and it all looked good. He even took me out with the crew 2 times. He didn't hide or relationship. 2 days ago I stalked him a bit too hard on social media and I came across a profile. That woman had a picture in a wedding dress, taken 2 months ago. And someone in the comments tagged him and called him a very lucky guy.

I confronted him about it and he confessed that yes, he got married. That woman is not the mother of his daughter. He also confessed that he loved our relationship because I was just a coffee shop girl, while his wife is a surgeon and he finds that a turn off. Are really all pilots like this? They even covered for him

1j71dpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_thoughtsofmerie/comments/1j71dpj/what_fridays_used_to_mean_and_what_they_mean_now/,What Fridays used to mean (and what they mean now),"Back in college, my professor had a habit of asking, *""What are your plans for Friday?""*   
  
Every week, without fail. And every week, I had an answer. **Fridays were for fun. I’d go out with friends, drink, dance, and stumble home in the early hours of the morning**. That was what Fridays were supposed to be—loud, fast, exciting.

Then the pandemic happened. 

Suddenly, my Fridays looked different. No parties, no plans, no noise. Just me at home, eating my mom’s home-cooked meals. At first, it felt strange, like something was missing. But over time, I learned to appreciate the quiet. Sitting at the dinner table, chatting with my family, laughing over something silly. Those moments became something I looked forward to.

Then came work. My first job. 

By the time Friday night rolled around, I was exhausted. My brain was tired from thinking all day, solving problems, and juggling tasks. Fun was the last thing on my mind. All I wanted to do was sleep. And that’s exactly what I did.

But then I moved out. **A new phase, a new kind of Friday.** No more family dinners. No more collapsing into bed at eight. Fridays became my own. No obligations. No expectations. Just me, deciding how to end the week.

Some nights, I’d sit in a quiet café, sipping coffee and people-watching. Other nights, I’d scroll through Netflix, rewatching my favorite series. Sometimes, I’d order food and enjoy the simple pleasure of eating alone. No pressure to make plans. No guilt for staying in.

Fridays, to me, are a reminder that I don’t have to live at full speed all the time. I don’t need to squeeze everything into one night. I don’t have to prove anything to anyone. I can take a walk if I feel like it. Go to a spa if I want to. Order my favorite meal just because.

I used to think Fridays were about doing something exciting. Now, I see them as a time to slow down. A time to remind myself that I have a life outside of work. That I don’t need to rush. That I deserve to enjoy the little things.

And that’s why Fridays will always be my favorite day of the week—because they remind me how far I’ve come in life and how much time has changed me.

**How about you? How have your Friday evenings changed over time?**
