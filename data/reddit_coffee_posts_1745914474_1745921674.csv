1kake4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCLEXsuccessStories/comments/1kake4k/i_almost_gave_up_on_my_nclex_journey_when_my/,I almost gave up on my NCLEX journey when my nursing school misplaced my transcripts!,"The fluorescent lights of my cramped apartment buzzed overhead as I sat hunched over my desk, surrounded by a fortress of NCLEX review books and half-empty coffee mugs. It was late 2024, and I’d been grinding for months, my life a blur of flashcards, practice questions, and the gnawing pressure of the licensure exam that stood between me and my dream of becoming a registered nurse. I was exhausted but determined, fueled by the vision of walking into a hospital with RN behind my name. That is, until the email from my nursing school landed in my inbox like a sucker punch.

“Your transcript request cannot be processed at this time,” it read. “Please contact the registrar’s office for further details.” My stomach dropped. The transcripts were the final piece I needed to register for the NCLEX with my state board. Without them, I was dead in the water. I called the registrar the next morning, expecting a quick fix, a clerical error, maybe, or a misplaced file. But the voice on the other end was curt: “We’re unable to locate your records at this time. We’re looking into it.” No timeline, no apology, just a vague promise to “get back to you.”

Days turned into weeks. I called daily, each conversation more infuriating than the last. “We’re still searching,” they’d say, or “It might be in an older system.” My nursing school, the institution I’d poured years of sweat and tuition into, had lost my proof of existence. My classmates were scheduling their exams, posting celebratory “Pearson Vue confirmation” screenshots on group chats, while I was stuck in limbo, my momentum crumbling. The NCLEX felt like a finish line I could see but never reached.
I started spiraling. What if they never found my transcripts? Would I have to retake courses? Start over? The thought was suffocating. One night, after another fruitless call, I slammed my laptop shut and shoved my review books off the desk. “I’m done,” I muttered to the empty room. The weight of the past years, clinicals, exams, sleepless nights crashed over me. Maybe nursing wasn’t worth it. Maybe I wasn’t cut out for this.

But the next morning, something shifted. My phone buzzed with a text from my friend Mariah, a fellow nursing graduate who’d faced her own battles with the board. “Don’t let their screw-up steal your dream,” she wrote. “You’re too close.” Her words lit a spark. I wasn’t ready to quit, not yet. I wiped the tears from my face and got to work.

I became a detective in my own life. I dug through old emails, found a PDF of my degree audit, and contacted every professor who might vouch for me. I called the registrar again, this time demanding to speak to the dean. My persistence paid off: the dean’s office launched an investigation, and after three agonizing weeks, they unearthed my transcripts in a mislabeled digital archive from a system migration gone wrong. They sent them to the state board with an official letter of apology, and I finally got my Authorization to Test.

The day I sat for the NCLEX, my hands trembled as I clicked through the questions, but my heart was steady. I’d fought too hard to get here. When the screen flashed “Pass” a week later, I didn’t just cry, I laughed, a wild, victorious sound that echoed through my apartment. The misplaced transcripts had nearly broken me, but they’d also taught me something: the road to nursing isn’t just about mastering meds and diagnoses. It’s about grit, about refusing to let someone else’s mistake define your future.

Now, as I pin my RN badge to my scrubs for my first hospital shift, I carry that lesson with me. The NCLEX was a battle, but it was only the beginning. I’m ready for whatever comes next.",1,1745921530.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,0,1.0,False

I have now a job which requires me to wake up around 5:30am. It starts in two days. I woke up early today for another reason and I ended up napping 3 hours when I came back home so now it's 7pm and I don't feel tired. Tomorrow I'm off so I'm thinking to take melatonin tonight to see the effects. 

I have melatonin by Apotex. It's 2mg. 

What time should I take it? How much? Does it cause nausea? (I'm pregnant - no judgment but having an abortion so I'm not worried about the fetus health) - and I'm feeling so nauseous 24/7. Will melatonin make it worse?

Ps extra info. I don't drink coffee. Unfortunately I smoke cigs which can keep me up but with the nausea I may stop. I watch TV before falling asleep.

We started texting a lot after that night.  Kat told me she lives a hour away from my hometown so it’s a long drive for her.

But Kat said my ex is a bad friend and wanted to hang out with me. So I invite Kat down for a coffee date and things took off. Fast forward my ex blew up my phone saying I’m a Ahole for sleeping with her friend. I said it’s cool when you do it to me but it’s an issue when I do it to you? Her response was she never slept with any of my friends and she only kissed the one in a drunken haze. And then she went off about how she just wanted my attention and she missed me and a bunch of other crap. I didn’t feel too bad about it but I felt like even tho she didn’t have respect for me or my feelings, I still shouldn’t stoop to her level because she is someone I still love to some degree and I shouldn’t be like that.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The floral tablecloth market offers a diverse range of options, each with its own unique set of features. This analysis will delve into the key aspects of top-rated tablecloths, focusing on material composition, size and shape availability, design characteristics, and durability.

**Material Composition:** Understanding the material composition of a floral tablecloth is crucial for determining its durability, stain resistance, and overall feel. Many popular options are made from cotton, linen, polyester, or blends of these materials.

Cotton tablecloths are known for their softness, breathability, and natural look. They are generally easy to care for but may be prone to wrinkling and staining. Linen tablecloths offer a more luxurious feel and are highly durable, but they also require more careful handling and ironing. Polyester tablecloths are highly stain-resistant, wrinkle-resistant, and easy to clean, making them a practical choice for everyday use. Blends combine the best qualities of different materials, offering a balance of comfort, durability, and easy care.

**Size and Shape Availability:** Floral tablecloths come in a variety of sizes and shapes to fit different table dimensions. Common shapes include rectangular, square, round, and oval.

Rectangular tablecloths are ideal for standard dining tables, while square tablecloths are suitable for smaller tables or accent tables. Round tablecloths add a touch of elegance to circular tables, and oval tablecloths provide a more unique and sophisticated look. It's essential to measure your table before purchasing a tablecloth to ensure a proper fit. A good rule of thumb is to allow for an overhang of at least 8-12 inches on each side.

**Design Characteristics:** The design of a floral tablecloth plays a significant role in setting the overall tone and style of your table setting. Floral patterns range from delicate and intricate to bold and modern.

Vintage-inspired floral designs often feature soft colors, such as pastels and muted tones, with detailed botanical illustrations. These tablecloths evoke a sense of nostalgia and romanticism. Modern floral designs, on the other hand, tend to incorporate brighter colors, geometric shapes, and abstract floral motifs. These tablecloths add a contemporary and vibrant touch to any table setting. Consider the existing d茅cor of your dining room or kitchen when choosing a floral design to ensure a cohesive and harmonious look.

**Durability and Care:** The durability and ease of care of a floral tablecloth are essential considerations for long-term use. A durable tablecloth should be able to withstand regular use and washing without fading, tearing, or shrinking.

Look for tablecloths that are made from high-quality materials and have reinforced seams. Stain resistance is another important factor, especially if you have children or frequently entertain guests. Many tablecloths are treated with a stain-resistant finish that helps to repel spills and prevent stains from setting in. Always follow the manufacturer's care instructions to ensure proper cleaning and maintenance. Most floral tablecloths can be machine washed and tumble dried, but some may require special care, such as hand washing or line drying.

Key features of the best floral tablecloths include:
* High-quality material composition (cotton, linen, polyester, or blends)
* Wide range of sizes and shapes to fit different table dimensions
* Diverse design characteristics, from vintage-inspired to modern
* Excellent durability and stain resistance
* Easy care and maintenance (machine washable and dryer-safe)

 ## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions when considering purchasing a floral tablecloth. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers.

**What is the best material for a floral tablecloth?**
    The best material depends on your specific needs and preferences. Cotton offers a soft and natural feel but may require more ironing. Linen is durable and luxurious but can be more expensive and require careful handling. Polyester is stain-resistant, wrinkle-resistant, and easy to care for, making it a practical choice for everyday use. Blends combine the best qualities of different materials, offering a balance of comfort, durability, and easy care.

**How do I choose the right size of floral tablecloth?**
    Measure your table's length and width (or diameter, if it's round). Add at least 16-24 inches to each dimension to allow for an 8-12 inch overhang on each side. This will ensure that the tablecloth drapes elegantly and provides adequate coverage.

**How do I care for my floral tablecloth?**
    Always follow the manufacturer's care instructions. Most floral tablecloths can be machine washed in cold water and tumble dried on low. Avoid using bleach, as it can damage the fabric and fade the colors. Iron on a low setting if necessary. For stubborn stains, pre-treat with a stain remover before washing.

**Are floral tablecloths suitable for outdoor use?**
    Yes, some floral tablecloths are specifically designed for outdoor use. Look for tablecloths made from water-resistant and fade-resistant materials, such as outdoor-grade polyester.

When choosing a floral tablecloth, consider your specific needs and preferences. Think about the size and shape of your table, the style of your dining area, and the level of durability and care you require.

If you prioritize a natural feel and classic design, a cotton floral tablecloth may be a good choice, despite its higher maintenance. If you seek a practical and low-maintenance option, a polyester floral tablecloth is ideal. If you want a balance of durability, style, and natural materials, a linen blend floral tablecloth is a great option.

Overall, the floral tablecloth market offers a wide range of options to suit different tastes and budgets. By carefully considering your needs and preferences, you can find the perfect floral tablecloth to enhance your dining experience and create a welcoming atmosphere for family and friends. While all options present unique advantages, consider prioritizing the stain-resistant Polyester Floral Tablecloth if ease of maintenance and longevity are of the utmost concern.

**Step-by-step guide: how to take the Savealotlistens com Customer Feedback Survey**

If you’ve just wrapped up a budget-friendly grocery haul at Save A Lot and still have the receipt in your hand (or your car), you’ve got a quick way to share your thoughts and maybe score a little something in return.

Here’s how to do the Savealotlistens com Customer Feedback Survey without overthinking it.

**>>** [**Find Official Survey Link Here**](https://overnightaddressfinder.com/savealotlistens-com-customer-feedback-survey/) **<<**

**Step 1: hang on to your receipt**  
The survey invite is printed on your receipt, usually near the bottom. Don’t toss it or let it crumple into oblivion in your back pocket. That code is your entry ticket.

**Step 2: visit >>** [**Find Official Survey Link Here**](https://overnightaddressfinder.com/savealotlistens-com-customer-feedback-survey/) **<<**  
Open your browser and head to the site. It’s mobile-friendly too, so you can do it from your phone while waiting in the car or during a coffee break.

**Step 3: enter your receipt info**  
You’ll be asked for a survey code, date, and store number — all stuff you can find right on the receipt. Just double check the numbers so you don’t get an error.

**Step 4: share your experience**  
This is your moment to speak up. Was the produce fresh? Were the shelves stocked? I once gave a shoutout to a cashier who helped me load heavy bags into the trunk without even asking — that kind of stuff matters. Don’t be shy about sharing the good or the not-so-good.

**Step 5: wrap it up and look for a reward**  
Once you finish, you might get a sweepstakes entry or a validation code. Either way, it's a win.

I wasn’t really paying attention, just staring out the window, when I noticed a small folded piece of paper under my coffee cup. I unfolded it and found a few handwritten words: “You’re doing better than you think. Keep going.”  
I looked around, but it wasn’t obvious who had left it. It felt like a message from the universe at just the right time.  I will forever be grateful to whoever left this for me.

I kept that note for months, tucked in my wallet. Whenever I felt off or doubted myself, I’d pull it out, and it would remind me that I was on the right path.  
One day, I was at the bus stop. There was a woman there looking exhausted, like she was carrying the weight of the world. She looked lost in thought, staring off into the distance. Without much thought, I slipped the note into her bag as she walked by, hoping it might make her day just a little easier, as it did mine.

I don’t know when this note started, but I hope it keeps traveling, passing through more hands than mine. I like to think that kindness, even in the smallest form, can travel further than we know.

Has anyone ever left something like that for you? A small act of kindness that stuck with you long after?

1kajxy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1kajxy3/am_i_crazy_wedding_regretembarrassment/,Am I crazy - Wedding regret/Embarrassment,"So, I'd like to know if I am actually insane. I look back on my wedding with a little bit of embarrassment and regret.

I've been with my husband for 8ish years, we have two kids together. 

We recently got married, the entire process of planning I was very ""whatever happens happens"" I feel like I even chose my dress because I didn't want to try on anything else (don't get me wrong I like it but I didn't have that ""I love this"" moment, let my also add to this that I have had issues with body image all my life)

I was never big on having a big extravagant day, I honestly wanted to elope. We had a small wedding, very laid back. Think smokehouse catering, barn style event. The whole lead up I felt calm, everyone I spoke to and vendors I dealt with told me how chill I was about everything. 

The wedding day rolls around, I'm still fairly chill (I think)  
We get to the venue, I think I'm still going well. 

Then things start to hiccup.

My flowers weren't like the inspo pictures, they were similar but definitely not what I had in mind

My youngest screams the whole ceremony

My dress was randomly bustled on one side whilst I walked down the isle (I don't know how this happened and I'm kind of upset no one including my wedding planner who was with me before I walked down the isle noticed) 

The horses didn't play ball for photos (which is fine I deal with horses they are unpredictable)

The photographer starts stressing about the sun going down so our intro is pushed back to get photos so we were away from our guests for a long time. And ultimately the light was too harsh and the photos didn't turn out. 

No coffee was announced
The DJ got a few things wrong 

My dress was annoying, the bustle was inside the dress and I felt like I kept tripping. So ended up holding on to the train or hanging it on the back of my dress which looked silly but as least I could get around (the train wasn't overly long but I am not a dress person) I wish I had of gotten a shorter dress to wear or something because I feel looking back I looked silly, in the moment I didn't care what it looked like. 

Now - I know these are all incredibly minor things. But I have an immense amount of embarrassment about them. And I feel as though maybe I should have been a little less ""go with the flow"" and maybe tried to be a little more direct, like asking the photographer to capture certain things. To suggest locations if she wasn't familiar with the venue.  

I am pretty introverted, and because it was my wedding I felt as though I should dance. Now I keep thinking I looked like a idiot. 

I keep thinking about the fact that for the 3 minutes my dress was bustled up on one side while I walked down the isle (my MOH fixed it when I got to the end) and that people will be having a laugh at my expense.  

I got the photos back and I don't like many, we didn't take it very seriously and you can tell we were just all having a laugh. The photographer also didn't really give direction, like hold your flowers lower. Turn a little this way. She also didn't capture many photos of close up of my husband and I. A lot of ""in the paddock from far away shots"" but I not a lot of photos of us looking at the camera.. my husband thinks they're great.

I'm actually dreading the video when that's ready because of how I'll look. I could tell she was also kind of stressed because we were mucking around with the bridal party a fair bit. 

My husband thinks I am insane, he had a wonderful time. And I did too, but I can't help but look back and think if maybe I just had of been more of a ""bridezilla"" or something things wouldn't have gone a little off course. I like to be very organised, which the day was organised. But ultimately I embarrassed myself by not not being the ""perfect composed demure bride"" and instead I was just focusing on having fun in the moment. 

I know how silly this sounds, a lot of people must dream of being more ""in the moment"" on their wedding day. I just can't help but feel I made an absolute idiot of myself, and if I had of had a different attitude I could have given more direction about what I wanted instead of having an ""it's all good"" attitude. 

In hindsight I may have suppressed how much stress I placed on myself. And it's been a shock to come out of the other side after being so stress free about the day to be worrying about these things. I didn't expect to feel this way. 

Has anyone else had something similar?

I’m almost 5 weeks into keto now. I originally started with the Lion Diet but switched to a more whole food keto approach because I noticed I feel way better when my ketones stay above 3.0 mmol/L. I’m mainly doing this to help manage OCD and overall mental clarity.

Last night I measured 3.4 mmol/L and felt super calm and clear. This morning though, it dropped back to 1.8.

Right now I’m eating stuff like:
	•	2 avocados with olive oil
	•	70/30 ground beef with cheddar and avocado oil
	•	Lamb rack with spinach and heavy cream for dinner
	•	Some olives here and there
	•	Plus 2 tablespoons of C8 MCT oil in black coffee every day

Does anyone have tips for keeping ketones more stable and above 3.0?
Would really appreciate any advice, especially from people doing keto for mental health reasons too.

Thanks!

1kajot4,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1kajot4/any_personal_life_relationship_advice_for_people/,Any Personal / Life / Relationship Advice for people suffering long-time eczema,"Hi guys, just wanted to share my story and hopefully to also get some personal / relationship / life advice.

To begin, I'm currently 30M, and have had eczema and extremely dry skin ever since I was a kid. I was on a course of Cyclosporine and Methotrexate with tapering dosage (on and off for almost 3 years), prescribed by the dermatologist that I used to frequent.

Up until Jun'24, these medication suddenly did not work for me anymore, my eczema suddenly flared so badly that every area of my face, body and limb was not spared. The area around my joints was so badly affected that I could not even walk. I had to be hospitalized at one point due to recurring cellulitis on my left feet too as well.

After recovering from a 3rd bout of cellulitis (all within 2 months), the same dermatologist told me to continue the course of immunosuppressants, and recommended me to do intermittent fasting. Halfway the course, I stopped as I felt that the medication was not helping at all.

Consequently around this time, I watched a video by Jordan Peterson with Dr. Scott McMahon & Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker on mold toxicity. This made me suspected that mold could be causing my eczema to go overdrive as there was always a musty smell in my room which I could not get rid of for a long time.

So on around Sep'24, I bought baking soda (3 tsp) and mix it with dish cleaner liquid (3 tsp) and water (1 jug). I spent an entire day wiping the walls, and my furniture such as room table and chair etc. Using clean water, I also wiped everything again afterwards to remove any residue. Then I also replaced my bed with a new one as well.

I saw major improvement in my skin, my eczema did not flare up again after I stopped taking the immunosuppressants or the oral steroids. However, the eczema around my face was still persistent, making my face reddish in the afternoons.

This was until when I overheard from a local radio talkshow that grounded coffee could also be a trigger for allergy due to a small percentage of insect remains that gets grounded together and could not be filtered away. The protein from insects are similar to crustaceans and therefore could trigger allergy if you are also allergic to shellfish etc. I completely stopped drinking my daily coffee afterwards and my face gradually clear up.

Coming to present day, my body is almost clear from eczema, maybe around 98%. No flare-ups for the past 6 months and I was able to start jogging and exercising in the morning every day to fix my health. Sweat no longer made me itch like crazy. There is still a small patch here on my feet but it has been improving as well.

So yea, this is my recovery story which I hope it can be of some help to anyone here. That being said, I must put up a disclaimer that eczema cases are unique to anyone suffering from it. What worked for me may not work for you, so please continue to consult a dermatologist or a medical professional.

On a last note, I finally started regaining my confidence and looking forward to life again. My social life was stunted for so long and I wanted to live life more. I want to find my second half, have a love life and live normally.

Therefore, for those in the same plight as mine, might I ask how you meet your second half and what obstacles you faced along the way and how did you overcome it ? What should I expect ?",1,1745918515.0,eczema,2,1.0,False

I was having a look on tiktok this morning over a coffee while waiting for a friend and I'm shocked at what I've just seen. 

Some people may be aware that fakey shakey, rants, Rachel George and a few others are all fighting and arguing with other tiktokers on live stream. There's doxxing, threats of harm and violence and pretend exposures, gaslighting and manipulation. Their behaviour is quite deplorable and how they claim they want the drama to cease, but they continue it and Ives seen their live streams. They don't want the drama to stop, they don't want their viewers to go down and strangely, recruiting what is deemed by our society as vulnerable people. For what purpose? To feel important, to feel like that leader that they never would be able to accomplish in the real world. Fakey shakey claims that an opposing group brought up her deceased parent, yet she brings it up continuously while playing the victim. Rants has apparently been doxxed and is specifically blaming the opposing side, but shows no proof of it. Rants threated truth seeker because they posted a clip and her child's voice in the background because Rants accidentally joined a live while trolling and harassing the opposing group. ""Don't mess with my child."" 

It wasn't so long ago that Rants encouraged the exposure that yorkie pud had a child who was removed from the mother's care. So here we have one rule for one and a different rule for everyone else. She's the leas bully. Even going as far as doxxing and bullying herself openly. Yesterday, a poor girl who is vulnerable was bullied and harassed by these same people on fake accounts and guess what the connection is, she stood up to the queen of the bullies aka Rants. She allows a man called Matt to befriend people, to be in their group after he threatened several women with violence and even threatened to stab someone! He ""apologised"" claimed that he was wrong for saying it, but still is aggressive in comments. Rants also has her own skeletons of domestic violence by biting her girlfriend in the face and being banned from her child's school due to her behaviour. Not quite the angel she thinks she is. 

The group has recruited and befriended Kirsten Cunningham of all people! We all know about KC and what they do and say, how they behave and the damage they've caused to viewers and themselves. I do feel she needs intervention, but we also know how manipulative they are and how they use other people's conditions for sympathy and attention. 

They will pretend it's amicable, they'll pretend that they're even going as far as trying to help Kiki, but we all know that isn't what's actually going on. These tiktokers need removed from tiktok as much as the bigger tiktokers who have worrisome behaviour. It's worrisome that they spend hours and hours on live stream every day and countless hours discussing and talking about tiktok, yet preach to everyone else. ",4,1745918485.0,chronickiki,0,1.0,False

I spent time in both Jodhpur and Jaipur, intentionally exploring cafes and trying to get a feel for the local coffee culture. It was exciting to see how quickly things are evolving—especially in Jaipur, which honestly blew me away. The coffee vibe there is not just growing, it’s thriving. Super cool, well-designed spaces, thoughtful menus, and a clear love for good brews.

In Jaipur, I dropped by Curious Life and Taffeta and roastery coffee house—all three are absolutely worth visiting. Curious Life served up one of the best cups, and Taffeta really stood out with its ambience and a very well-curated coffee menu.

Jodhpur is still catching up, but there’s something brewing (pun intended). I visited, First Crack Roastery, and Ghar Café—and while it’s early days compared to Jaipur, the potential is clearly there.

Overall, it was refreshing to see such a vibrant and growing coffee culture in Rajasthan. Can’t wait to go back and explore more!",17,1745918430.0,IndiaCoffee,5,0.95,False

# Letters of Recommendation

APES Teacher - 8/10 - Did really well in her class and was one of the more engaged students in the room. Environmental science is pretty easy so I usually ended up helping my classmates which she noticed. I actually really enjoyed her class and had some good talks with her about my future plans and personal life, which is kinda weird because I didn't know she existed before I took the class. She said I reminded her of her son but idk if that's a good thing or not. Super sweet and super nice lady. Ultimately this is the only AP test I didn't get a 5 on which is lowk my fault because I got waaay too cocky after breezing through all the practice tests in the weeks before. Didn't study at all so I deserve it.

  
Calculus Teacher - 9/10 - Known her since freshman year because of math team and did well in her class. She's very fair and probably the best math teacher I've ever had. She even met my parents at one point so I'm hoping she wrote a nice letter. Talked a bunch about college options and different paths I could take in life with her. She gave me some good advice about taking care of myself mentally and avoiding burnout which I really struggle with. She emphasized the importance of healthy coping mechanisms and how she's seen too many students with bright futures ruin it for themselves through self-destructive tendencies \*cough\*cough\*. I trust her a lot and I'm sure she wrote a solid letter.

# Interviews

Duke (7/10) - Zoom call soon after I submitted my application. Talked a little bit about the academics but ended up chatting more about college life in general and Durham. She gave a lot of great advice that would be really useful if I was going there, especially about which dorms to pick, professors to avoid, and things to do. Was lowk coming off a brazy weekend during the interview so I wasn't my usual charming self. 

John Carroll (10/10) - Met this guy in-person at a Panera. He bought me food and coffee when I was having a shitty day so instant 10/10. Had a 1.5 hour long conversation about pretty much every part of the school and I filled three pages of notes up. Dude was super welcoming, communicative, easy-to-work-with, and friendly. It's unfortunate that this school was pretty much my last resort because this dude was putting in the EFFORT to get me to go there. Was also getting recruited to wrestle here pretty hard.

UChicago (3/10) - Recruiting call over the phone. Dude was trying really hard to convince me to go but pretty much deflected all of my questions and kept circling back to ""notthealt42, UChicago is an amazing investment into your future"" like a bajillion times. This was soon after he dropped the $95k annual COA and mentioned that they don't give athletic scholarships or really much merit aid at all. He just didn't have any actual information about the school and it felt like he was just talking to me to try to convince me to commit. Ended up not applying.

Loyola Chicago (9/10) - In-person interview for scholarship. Only lasted about 20 mins. I was one of the last people interviewed that day and my lady was losing her voice. Talked a lot about my car, legal troubles in relation to said car, the beauty of mac n cheese, and the detrimental effects of healthcare inequality on communities and individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, especially in relation to the societal poverty cycle and the unfair burden of medical debt upon families and how going to Loyola for premed will help support my goal of working towards solving that issue. I would give it a 10 but I was lowk sick af leading up to the interview and was so zonked off the flu meds that I don't remember the finer details. Must've done well though because I got a phone call a month later where they told me my interviewer thought I was ""the most human"" candidate.

# Essays

Personal statement I put a fuck ton of time into. I started writing it at the end of junior year and didn't really finish until October, two weeks before my first applications went out. I did this on purpose. I worked on it bit by bit everyday until it was almost perfect so that I wouldn't procrastinate it until the last minute. and I got as many eyes on it as I could. I'm actually really proud of it even though I clocked in at 647 words which is slightly high. I wrote the essay about pizza. The main selling point of my pizza place is that customers are able to completely customize their pizza, from type of crust to the toppings to how it's cut. I wrote the essay about how every pizza I made was a ""floury caricature"" of the individuals on the other side of the glass and that every topping and culinary-decision represented memories, personality traits, cultural backgrounds, childhood experiences, etc. I then described my personal pizza and the various parts of my life story and personality represented through every ingredient. 

Supplemental essays I honestly wish I spent more time on. I got REALLY burnt out really fast, and was under a shit ton of pressure from my parents to get a big scholarship so I (and my family) didn't have to deal with expensive college costs. August-January was also really hard for me in my personal life. I had a lot of really stressful things I was dealing with that made it damn hard to focus on the seemingly distant future. Some of this was caused by my own irresponsible decisions but a lot of it was just fucking unlucky. As a result, some of my supplementals were a little lacking. They weren't bad but they were just kind of basic, especially my ""Why Us"" essays where I didn't include nearly enough detail.

# The Decision

My wrestling career came to a close when one of my internal organs decided to implode during a match. Goes to show how relying on athletics to get you into and pay for college can be a risk... anything can change with just a little bit of bad luck.

So, it comes down to three schools: Northwestern, Tulane, and Loyola Chicago. 

Northwestern - $220k est. total, w/ ISP more like $170k. Dream school since I was 10 mostly because of my parents. My mom went there for undergrad/grad. Spent my whole childhood around Northwestern events and people, especially ISP alumn so I **really** wanted to do it.

Tulane - $125k est. total, really fell in love with this school especially after admitted student day

LUC - $78k est. total, full-tuition scholarship. Don't like the school personally and academically weakest school of the three. But I only have to pay room and board which parents are willing to help me out with so its basically **free**.

I have two days left to make a decision. After many sleepless nights fueled by stress and depression (hence why I'm up at 3am (now 4am)) and long talks with my family I don't think I can turn Loyola down. **I have a very real possibility of graduating undergrad completely debt free.** This is an insane blessing and I am so incredibly thankful to have been offered this opportunity. I have multiple younger siblings going to college right after me and my parents can't cosign loans for all of us. Yes, I'm sacrificing my dreams, but sometimes that's just how shit goes. At the end of the day undergrad is a stepping stone to medical school. I'm not here for the ""traditional college experience"" where these are the ""best four years of my life"": I'm here to get in, get out, and ball tf out on that transcript and the MCAT.

**Additional Information:**

In total I applied to 20 schools and got 14 acceptances, 2 waitlists, and 4 rejections, coming out to a 70% acceptance rate. By my classifications 7 of those were reach schools or hard targets, 4 were targets, and 9 were safeties or light targets. I also applied for every available honors program and got into all of em. I also applied for **every** additional merit-scholarship I could. Between the personal statement, supplementals, scholarships, honors programs, and specialty programs... I wrote well over 60 essays!

I did NOT ED anywhere because I can't make that financial commitment haha

Speaking of finances:

The mean 4-year cost of all 14 schools I got into came out at $171,091.46 with a minimum of $77,800 (LUC) and a maximum of $297,552.00 (USC). It is worth noting that UW-Madison gave me $0.00 in total aid totalling to $259,312.00 after four years which is STILL cheaper than USC who gave me $25.5k per year in merit. Adding up all my annual aid packages over four years as they are today, I earned a total of **$1,412,496** in merit scholarships.

 1. Everyone says they want something serious until things get serious. Then suddenly it’s “I’m not ready” or “I’m working on myself.” mean while you left on someone who might have been the one ..

.
 



2. Never date influencers. You’re not on a date, They will write in their bio that they are looking for something serious and invite you over their place for the first meet . Remember they are looking for content . Your heartfelt date can be hers next viral reel.
 
.


3. Yes, some people are here just for free food. You think it’s chemistry, she thinks it’s an appetizer and free meal.
 
.


4. Entitlement is peaking. 
With so many options on their fingertips some women develop a sense of entitlement, it's not their persona just the paradox of choice.
 
.


5. “Dating to marry” is a cute lie.
I want husband energy, but will ghost you if you breathe weird. They disappear like a fart in the air.

.

 


6. The I m only looking for casual folks? They catch feelings by week two and start dropping hints like, So, what are we?.

 .

7. Dear boys: desperation is not a personality trait. She doesn’t want 4 voice notes, a poem, and a LinkedIn request before the first coffee date. Chill. Flowers and chocolates on after 2nd date please ( as told by many ).

 .

8. Women always keep options open. If you’re wondering why she disappeared, she’s probably giving the Chad one last chance. but they will come back after the Chad's emotional unavailablity kicks in.
 
.


9. Money and profession matter. A lot. You could be kind, emotionally available, and make great pancakes—but if your job title doesn’t flex, prepare to be just a friend. It influences the attention you recieve . I won't call it gold digging but Financial compatibility.
 
.


10. You always fall for the wrong one. Every. Damn. Time. You open up, get soft, and she hits you with a you’re too sweet for me  it’s a eulogy.Bhailog it still hurts 🤕 .
 

.


11. Bad boys win. Every time. She’ll leave you on seen to cry over a man who replies with 'k' . May be its the thrill of changing them into a green flag .

What to do ?

Stop letting these apps decide your worth, go out on dates if it's fun , but if it's draining delete them 

Never trust any one ( they are still strangers even if they want to sleep with you )

Learn the red flags to avoid and try to pretend liking someone not your type just for the sake of female attention. 

Always prioritize emotional availablity and equal efforts over looks ",56,1745918400.0,Indiangirlsontinder,13,0.98,False

""Oh, yeah?!"" Timmy suddenly snapped at his parents. ""Well, why didn't you say all that when I explained to you that Vicky was evil, huh?""

Timmy's Parents were shocked.

""Don't answer!"" Timmy interrupted. ""I know why - you two are the most stupidest, dumbest, selfish parents I've ever had the misfortune to have!"" he yelled.

Timmy's parents felt hurt & offended. ""But Timmy,"" Timmy's Dad said, ""We're not dumb, selfish and stupid! We *do* care for you!""

Alas, Timmy was not appeased. ""Well, you should've thought about that before you sided with Vicky!""

""But Timmy!"" Timmy's Dad said.

""Too late!"" Timmy shouted. ""You've *had* your chance!""

""Timmy,"" begged Timmy's Mom, ""please come home! We miss you!""

**""NEVER!""** shouted Timmy. ""I am **never** coming home and I am **NEVER** seeing you horrible jerks again! Goodbye **forever!** **FOR REAL!**""

Using the power button on the green magic remote, he turned the screen where his parents were off.

In the real world, Timmy's parents watched the screens go blank.

A heart beat sounded, then...

Timmy's parents burst into tears, and ran out of Dimmadelphia Cable, crying their eyes out, all unnoticed by Doug Dimmadome, who was still babbling on about Timmy. ""But he did ruin my chances of movin' the Ballhogs to Alaska, and I already bought them blubber nuggets. But they *were* chewy."" he paused. ""But then again, he did teach me the greatest love of all was inside of me...""

Back at Timmy's house, Timmy's parents were looking at a photo album.

""Remember when he started walking?!"" Timmy's dad said tearfully.

""Oh, that was the best moment in our lives."" Timmy's mom said tearfully. ""He was such a brilliant kid when he was born!""

""And now he does this!"" Timmy's Dad said. ""Oh, how foolish we were to yell at him!"" he said sadly.

""If only we'd listened to him earlier about Vicky!"" Timmy's mom sobbed.

Then suddenly, a realization hit them.

**""WE'RE BAD PARENTS!""** they wailed.

Immediately, they burst into tears again, their tears forming waterfalls that flooded their house, and poured outta their doors and windows.

Up in Fairy World, Jorgen Von Strangle had witnessed how sad Timmy's parents were. and, suffice to say, he was not happy. Not one little bit.

""Turner..."" he growled, crushing his coffee cup in his fist.

**Meanwhile**, in a far away part of California, Timmy had wished himself up a new house, far away from Dimmsdale, it was a totally enormous mansion full of everything Timmy was wishing for, and more.

""Isn't this great, guys?!"" Timmy said to his fairies. ""No school, no parents, no more Vicky, and now, it's nothing but freedom! Paradise! Fun Fun FUN!""

But Timmy's fairies, Cosmo & Wanda, weren't happy.

""Timmy,"" said Wanda, ""Don't you think you should go home to your parents?""

""Yeah,"" said Cosmo, ""I bet they're as upset as I am when I lose Philip, my lucky nickel.""

""Out of the question."" Timmy said bluntly. ""I'm not going home. Ever.""

""Besides,"" he added, ""I've stopped Vicky from ruining the future, and now, I'm the happiest boy in the world!""

""But your parents will miss you!"" said Wanda crossly. ""And your friends will miss you too!""

""So?"" Timmy said. ""It's not my problem anymore.""

""Besides,"" he added, ""Mom & Dad can find another kid to look after. There's about 50 gazillion other kids in the world. They can just get a new one!""

""But Timmy,"" said Wanda, ""the new kid they get won't be *you*. YOU belong to your parents. You belong to them. They *love* you! They care for you.""

""No way!"" Timmy said. ""I'm so happy, my life is perfect! Nothing can possibly ruin it!""

**SUDDENLY!**

Jorgen Von Strangle appeared!

""TURNER!"" Jorgen shouted. ""You have broken a family relationship! You abandoned your parents just because you had a grudge on them with your evil babysitter Vicky.""

""Yeah!"" Timmy said defiantly, ""So what? They didn't listen to me when Vicky messed up the place and blamed it on me. So I'm better off without any parents at all!""

Jorgen glared coldly at TImmy.

""If that's the way it is for you, so be it."" he said grimly. Then he grabbed Cosmo & Wanda. ""I am taking away your fairies forever!"" he said angrily. ""Now you truly are alone, you puny ungrateful earth boy!""

""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" Timmy yelled, but it was too late. Jorgen disapppeared, and now, Timmy Turner was left all on his own.

We were former coworkers at a previous company last year. She was cute but I was never really attracted or had feelings for her before. We never really talked much until our mutual friends/coworkers decided to hang out much more often these past few months. 

This girl... She's just full of adventure and passion. I already knew this fact because we're also friends on Facebook and Instagram. She loves to hike, travel outdoors, and go to the most breathtaking sceneries around the country. That's probably one of the main reasons why I fell for her. But the moment that really hit the nail for me was when we finally went on a mountain hike together, along with our mutual friend. When I first saw her during that day, it was like lightning just struck me. And it's kind of weird because I didn't find her this beautiful in the past. Also, the way she talks is very gravitating and the way she smiles is probably the biggest factor because her eyes literally disappear when she smiles. It's too adorable.

Admittedly, I also just came from a breakup last December but my ex and I ended the relationship on good terms that's why I must've moved on much quicker. 

Anyway, my feelings for this girl became deeper after the hike. I started to think about her much more often. Then, one day I decided to muster up all my courage and asked her to have a cup of coffee with me. Fortunately, she agreed. I was so nervous deep inside because it was the first time that I'm going to talk to a girl that I really like after a long time. Luckily for me, we've had a great time catching up on each other's lives and getting to know each other much better.

But here's the catch, I asked her that day if she's currently dating anyone right now and she replied she doesn't have one. Then I followed up with another question, ""Are you open to being in a relationship right now?""
Which then she replied, ""I'm not really thinking about those kind of things right now. I'm more into self-love lately."" 
Which prompted me to ask when her last relationship was. She then answered that it was also just last year.

I know this story is a bit long for just explaining the context, but I just really need some thoughts or insights from you guys/ladies about this because I really like this girl and I don't want to come off as desperate. I'd really appreciate any kind of advice or words from you all.",2,1745918326.0,LifeAdvice,4,1.0,False

2:30 am

I'm staying up, lights of my rooms on, as always, because yeah, I have to do the assignment. Suddenly my neck is aching. Ugh...Guess I need to take a break. So, I walk to the living room, sit on the couch, turn the TV on and start to browse channels, especially the cartoon ones because those Hindi dramas...aren't my cup of coffee. Suddenly I stumble into animax. What? I thought that channel was closed long ago. I guess they bought it back... So, I shake it off and start to watch it. Okay, just an random anime going on... I keep watching it. Then suddenly, with a glitch... I see that the next show is My Hero Academia OVA. Wait...why does the design looks like a fanmade...The OVA name...""My Hero Academia: A Burned Dream""? What kind of name is this?! Then suddenly the music is not really like the usual openings. It keeps changing the tempo in an ominous way. It doesn't sound normal at all... 

After that off-tuned opening, I see Midoriya studying in the night, exactly like how I'm studying and— wait...why does this look like my room? It's not exactly the same,but the setup looks like mine. Then suddenly, he hears the rustle. I feel like the rustle is coming from my room. The screen is glitching as he's coming closer to the wardrobe. He sees a hoodie that he doesn't remember belonging. Then suddenly, he hears the whispers. Midoriya. I also can feel the whisper through my ears. I turn back and see nothing. Then I turn my head to the TV. He's back to study again. Then suddenly, the scene shifts into the school. Aizawa ses him. Aizawa's inner monologue is like ""why does he look familiar?"" Then he remembers the incident when Endeavor was the teacher instead of Aizawa. Aizawa was new back then. Endeavor happened to burn the training arena and apparently half of the students were taken away. Iida, Tsuyu, Sero, Shoji, Aoyama, Tokoyami, Satou, Hagakure and...Midoriya. He's shocked. Wait, how is Midoriya alive? 

The scene cuts and shows him just wandering. Suddenly he stops by the old storage, which is so forgotten by everyone. Then his eyes go on a mirror. In the mirror, however, he saw nothing but a version of himself...his skin burned. His eyes are still determined, but it's saddened. It says, ""I couldn't save anyone, Izuku. I couldn't, I couldn't fulfill my dream."" Midoriya gets scared.

""who are you? What are you doing here?"" 

""I am you, from the other universe. Back then, when Endeavor was the teacher, he accidentally burned the training arena and half of us died. I-I could not save anyone."" 

It starts crying. I swear I clench my heart. Tears fall from my eyes. I want to hug Midoriya. 

""You are living my dream."" 

And then the scene ends. 

Full black. 

I don't know what actually happened to Midoriya.

Then after a few seconds , the credit rolls. No music. Just texts scrolling up. Then I notice something weird...all the writings are in japanese...one is only in English...it says 

""©bones at 2010""

Wait...not even MHA manga started back then! Suddenly the room's lights are flickering. I just rush into my sister's room to wake her up 

""Sis, did you see something? Did you feel something""

 ""No,I didn't feel anything. Don't scare me like that. You know that I'm scared of this kind of stuff"" as she rubs her eyes.

""I'm sorry""

But all of a sudden I feel like I've been hit by a truck.

For the last week and a half my knees have been painful when I stand up. Then yesterday I started to get nausea on and off, headache and more and more tired as time has gone on, despite having more sleep than usual.
I've been managing to eat fine between the nausea episodes so I don't think it's any kind of virus or anything.
Last night I went to bed early, I took diazepam and paracetamol during the day cause my anxiety was getting a bit unbearable.
Then before bed I took a cyclizine for the nausea, I dozed off but then woke up around 11pm when my partner came to bed. I was immediately violently shaking, feeling like I'm gonna throw up, the nausea was horrid. I got out of bed because I didn't know what to do with myself, I could barely lift my legs to walk because the shaking was so bad and I almost fell over.
I managed to get myself downstairs, chewed on some gum and got some alcohol rub to sniff, put a comfort TV show on and the shaking slowly started to subside, along with the nausea, and eventually I managed to fall asleep. The whole ordeal lasted maybe half an hour tops but it was awful.
I can't work out if I was nauseous because I was panicking or if I was panicking because I was nauseous (I'm emetophobic).
I woke maybe one more time in the night but I was ok.
This morning though, I am so unbelievably exhausted, mentally and physically. If it weren't for my toddler I'd have stayed in bed.
I've managed to eat and have some coffee and I generally feel ok, but seriously my energy levels are so low and my heart is fluttery with a mild tiredness kind of headache that I've had for the last 2 days.

I'm not officially diagnosed, I'm waiting for an appointment with endocrinology, but my bloods show high levels of antibodies in my thyroid.

How can I tell if this could be a flare up? If a doctor's tests my thyroid function during a flare up, would it show something?

I'm new to this and so lost. These episodes do happen to me periodically but I'm unsure of what triggers it. I've been stressed for months so I'm confused as to why now it is hitting me, if it is that.",2,1745918188.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

**Step-by-step guide: how to take the www united family com customer feedback survey**

Whether you shop at United Supermarkets, Market Street, Albertsons Market, or Amigos, The United Family wants to hear how your trip went. And no, it’s not just corporate talk — they actually use this feedback to make changes.

Here’s how to take the survey and possibly get something in return.

**>>** [**Find Official Survey Link Here**](https://overnightaddressfinder.com/theunitedfamily-com-customer-feedback-survey/) **<<**

**Step 1: keep your receipt**  
Before you toss it in the bottom of a grocery bag or let it ride around in your car for two weeks, check your receipt. It should mention a survey invitation and a code near the bottom.

**Step 2: go to >>** [**Find Official Survey Link Here**](https://overnightaddressfinder.com/theunitedfamily-com-customer-feedback-survey/) **<<**  
Once you’ve got a few minutes to spare (seriously, it’s quick), head to the site. I usually do mine with a cup of coffee after unloading groceries.

**Step 3: enter the info from your receipt**  
You’ll be asked to enter a code, the date and time of your visit, and maybe the store number. All of it’s printed on your receipt, so don’t overthink it.

**Step 4: rate your experience**  
This is the part where you get to be honest. Was everything easy to find? Did someone help you bag your groceries? I once had a cashier suggest a cheaper brand of coffee that was on sale — totally appreciated that. Give them credit when it’s due, and speak up if something wasn’t great.

**Step 5: submit and look for a reward**  
Some surveys offer sweepstakes or coupon codes. Either way, it helps make your next trip better.

* She doesn’t remember working with Luke Perry.  She needed clips to remember that she did.
* He was a down to earth guy.
* Perry kept complimenting Davis’ eyes, and calling them like a husky dog.  He wanted to date her.  She didn’t want to date an actor.
* Davis’ friend asked Davis what she was going to do with Luke Perry.  Davis said “I don’t know”.  Perry had been wanting to dance with her.
* So Davis’ friend grabbed Davis, introduced her to some other guy, put Davis hand on that guy, then ran off towards Luke Perry herself.  Perry and that friend ended up sleeping together for a long time.
* Davis had been an accidental wing person.

* One time, she wore the same suspenders and red pants from an episode of Charles In Charge.  She was 12.  She then went to Universal Studios.  The show had just debuted the night before, and she was wearing the same pants as that episode the next day.  She wasn’t thinking about all of this.
* She got recognized right away.  When they asked her if she was from Charles In Charge, she said no, I’m not on the show.  She didn’t know what to say.
* People also recognize her from Two And A Half Men, and The Young And The Restless.

* She finds it hard to audition because managers will say they know her from Charles In Charge and not look past that.
* She took 6 years off from acting.  She doesn’t think it was a great move for her acting career.  But doesn’t regret it either.  
* Fans don’t really want to see her at 90s Cons, because it’s meant for people that haven’t worked in a long time.  If she’s still working, then she’s too current.  Those cons are for actors that haven’t done much in a long time.
* She thanks Ferriero for saying that she gave Beverly Hills, 90210 life.",1,1745918052.0,BeverlyHills90210,3,1.0,False

I can only assume its to do with the rubber cap  in some way. It looks and feels fine, but wanted to get some advice before I buy a replacement cap.

Some people may be aware that fakey shakey, rants, Rachel George and a few others are all fighting and arguing with other tiktokers on live stream. There's doxxing, threats of harm and violence and pretend exposures, gaslighting and manipulation. Their behaviour is quite deplorable and how they claim they want the drama to cease, but they continue it and Ives seen their live streams. They don't want the drama to stop, they don't want their viewers to go down and strangely, recruiting what is deemed by our society as vulnerable people. For what purpose? To feel important, to feel like that leader that they never would be able to accomplish in the real world. Fakey shakey claims that an opposing group brought up her deceased parent, yet she brings it up continuously while playing the victim. Rants has apparently been doxxed and is specifically blaming the opposing side, but shows no proof of it. Rants threated truth seeker because they posted a clip and her child's voice in the background because Rants accidentally joined a live while trolling and harassing the opposing group. ""Don't mess with my child."" 

It wasn't so long ago that Rants encouraged the exposure that yorkie pud had a child who was removed from the mother's care. So here we have one rule for one and a different rule for everyone else. She's the leas bully. Even going as far as doxxing and bullying herself openly. Yesterday, a poor girl who is vulnerable was bullied and harassed by these same people on fake accounts and guess what the connection is, she stood up to the queen of the bullies aka Rants. She allows a man called Matt to befriend people, to be in their group after he threatened several women with violence and even threatened to stab someone! He ""apologised"" claimed that he was wrong for saying it, but still is aggressive in comments. Rants also has her own skeletons of domestic violence by biting her girlfriend in the face and being banned from her child's school due to her behaviour. Not quite the angel she thinks she is. 

The group has recruited and befriended Kirsten Cunningham of all people! 

They will pretend it's amicable, they'll pretend that they're even going as far as trying to help Kiki, but we all know that isn't what's actually going on. These tiktokers need removed from tiktok as much as the bigger tiktokers who have worrisome behaviour. It's worrisome that they spend hours and hours on live stream every day and countless hours discussing and talking about tiktok, yet preach to everyone else.

1kajkaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kajkaa/understanding_my_fathers_financial_and_general/,Understanding my father's financial and general choices concerning me,"Okay, I most likely will sound ungrateful here. I definitely will. I just need to get some outsider perspective on what's currently going on between between me and my father, because I'm constantly feeling so frustrated whenever this comes up it's driving me crazy.

Details: So, I'm recently a new adult. I'm in an Australian government program that spans a year and started this middle of February, and if I'm a good public servant and pass my required study course by the end of this year, I get to move to a higher level. I earn around 1800 bi-weekly, and due to other things I pay for (transport is 210 a month, coffee is 20 a week, gym membership is 40 bi-weekly ++) so let's just say I really only have 1400 every two weeks.

Now here's the thing: I'm to move out this September.

I have to pay 215 now in boarding fees a week. Of course, I'm more than happy to pay. It's lower than local weekly share house fees (230-300+) and I don't have to pay for really anything house else. HOWEVER, what drives me crazy is that over 5 months this is around 4 grand, and his reasons for doing so. Dad reasons that this is to help me learn financing with a chunk of my payslip gone, but I already know how to do that (I save literally over a grand of my paychecks into my savings, and do not touch that). He's comparing my soon to be living situation to my step-mom, who lived in Melbourne in a share-house to study in a 20 years ago economy, so apparently I'll be okay.

I've been told to save money all my life. He persuaded me into this program, when I planned to go into nursing. Then suddenly when I try and ask to save, when I ask to do 215 bi-weekly instead to save 2 grand instead of the 4 grand I'd be giving him completely to put into future rent, food and emergency funds, I can't do that. It's personally insane. I'm leaving in September, five months. He wanted me to move out in May, but I reasoned to him that getting out of the probation period in September first would be better.

He always carries the fact that due to me being an adult now, he has no obligations towards me and this is out of his heart. Thank you, dad! Please then listen to me when I tell you I'm worried about my finances. I really, really don't think around approx 14 grand in savings is good enough to have in the bank when I move out. I have several goals I'm trying to save up for: a first house, if not at least my own apartment in a couple of years, investments, uni in the future, a few more. Now, here's where I sound selfish due to what he will do for me:

He will pay my rental bond as he says, helping with some furniture. Maybe a few groceries from time to time, and I'll be able to come over every Sunday to meal prep for the next week. (Perhaps this sounds pessimistic, but I doubt this one due to differentiating schedules and my parents also takes care of my little siblings.) I'll also still be on his health insurance, yay!

To summarise: it's frustrating I'm leaving either way in 5 months and practically isn't allowed to save as much as I could due to a new boarding fee and my other required expenses. I want to know if it's reasonable that I'm asking to pay 215 bi-weekly rather than weekly, at the very least.

Criticise me heavily in the comments if you'd like due to how I know this looks, but that's it. Thank you.",2,1745917936.0,personalfinance,1,1.0,False

I’m almost 5 weeks into keto now. I originally started with the Lion Diet but switched to a more whole food keto approach because I noticed I feel way better when my ketones stay above 3.0 mmol/L. I’m mainly doing this to help manage OCD and overall mental clarity.

Last night I measured 3.4 mmol/L and felt super calm and clear. This morning though, it dropped back to 1.8.

Right now I’m eating stuff like:
	•	2 avocados with olive oil

	•	70/30 ground beef with cheddar and avocado oil

	•	Lamb rack with spinach and heavy cream for dinner

	•	Some olives here and there

	•	Plus 2 tablespoons of C8 MCT oil in black coffee every day

Does anyone have tips for keeping ketones more stable and above 3.0?
Would really appreciate any advice, especially from people doing keto for mental health reasons too.

Thanks!

I'm a 26 male based in Chennai, looking to explore a no commitment, vibe checked connection.
I know this might sound wild but sometimes, life needs a little wildness, right?

I'm deeply into the experience more than just the act itself. Sensuality, laughter, chemistry, and raw energy, that's what I seek.

If you are a plus size women (or chubby if you wanna call that way :P ) are most welcome!

Some of my favorite pleasures include:

Prolonged foreplay

Cuddling and soft skin-to-skin moments

Breast play, navel play

Saliva play, dog play, and a taste for light BDSM (think handcuffs, blindfolds)

And yes, a strong love for giving (cunnilingus is a passion, not a duty!)

If you're open minded, kink friendly, and craving an unforgettable experience, I’d love for us to create a night that’s truly worth remembering.

I’m open to exploring your desires too, as long as we both stay within our comfort zones. Enthusiastic consent is everything.

I can book a stay at high rated hotel or a similar classy spot, where we can unwind without any rush.

If meeting a stranger makes you hesitant (totally understandable), let’s meet casually first, maybe over dinner or coffee, feel the vibes, no pressure.

If either of us catches any red flags, we walk away, zero questions asked. Safety and comfort are a priority.

I’ve been out of the dating scene for the past few months due to work and life stuff now, I’m ready to reconnect with someone who’s equally keen on diving into a night of passion, intimacy, and exploration.

If this resonated with you even a little, let’s talk.
Discretion, respect, and fun guaranteed.

DMs are open :)

I remember the first time she smiled at me, as if the whole world paused for just a second. Her eyes were so full of hope, of something that felt real, something I didn’t know I was capable of giving. But I tried. God, I tried.

At first, we built a life. Small moments: Sunday mornings in bed, the smell of her coffee, the way she laughed at the dumbest jokes. But soon, the cracks started showing. Tiny things, things you’d brush off if you weren’t paying attention.

I stopped making her laugh. She stopped looking at me the same way.

And then, one day, it was like a switch flipped. I woke up to an empty house, the echo of her absence lingering like the faintest whisper. She was gone. The notes she left were always the same: **""I'm fine.""** But I knew she wasn’t. I knew she had been fading for months, hiding in the silence.

I tried to talk to her, but every time, she looked through me. Her eyes had lost that spark, that warm light that made me believe everything would be okay. She no longer saw me — she just saw the shell of someone who used to be the person she loved.

One night, I found her sitting in the dark. She didn’t even flinch when I walked in. The room smelled like stale air, and the only light came from the streetlamp outside, casting shadows on her face. Her hands were trembling.

""Why did you leave?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

She didn’t look at me. Her gaze was fixed somewhere far away, a place I couldn’t follow. ""Because I needed to. You don’t understand,"" she said.

I reached out for her hand, but she pulled away. ""I *do* understand,"" I pleaded. ""I see you, I see how you're breaking, but I need you to come back. Please.""

She shook her head slowly, the sadness in her eyes cutting deeper than any argument. ""I’m already gone,"" she whispered.

And in that moment, I realized — it wasn’t the distance that had taken her. It was the time we had wasted, the moments we didn’t fight for, the love we thought we could just hold onto without effort. The love that had turned into something empty, hollow, like a room full of broken glass that couldn’t be fixed.

She wasn’t coming back. And neither was I.

The last time I saw her, she walked out the door without a second glance. Her figure faded into the night, and all I could hear was the sound of my own breath, a reminder of how utterly alone I had become.

And that’s when it hit me: I wasn’t afraid of losing her.  
I was afraid of never having had her at all.

But I have to say, the whole process of ordering was really easy and smooth. There was a small delay with shipping, but when I messaged Tom about it, he actually replied himself and sorted it quickly. That meant a lot to me. Everything about the experience felt personal and well taken care of, and the audiobook was just as easy to access and use.

When I went looking for reviews, I didn’t see many that really spoke to me, so I wanted to share my experience in case someone out there is like me and wondering if this book is worth it. From my perspective, someone who’s been through burnout, self-doubt, and a tough breakup, this book was honestly life-changing.

I ordered both the physical copy and the audiobook because being dyslexic means I usually need both to really stay with a book. I ended up switching between the two depending on whether I was driving, walking, or reading in a coffee shop. That flexibility made the whole experience smoother and more enjoyable for me.

From the very beginning, the book made me reflect on how often I’ve been influenced without even realizing it. Especially at work. My old job always pushed this idea of team spirit and doing whatever it takes to help the company grow. What that really meant was staying late, doing unpaid overtime, and being made to feel like you weren’t committed if you said no. It was all wrapped up in nice language, but underneath it, there was pressure and guilt. The kind that makes you second-guess your own boundaries.

And then there was my breakup. Reading this book helped me realize how much of myself I lost in that relationship without even noticing at the time. I was with someone who believed in a very structured and traditional idea of success. He was all about waking up early, reading textbooks, always learning in a way that made sense to him. I’m different. I thrive on creativity. I’m spontaneous, passionate, and I do my best thinking at night. But instead of celebrating that, he made me feel like I wasn’t enough. Like I wasn’t driven or serious because I didn’t do things the way he did.

I didn’t see it at the time, but slowly I started to believe it. That I was lazy. That maybe I didn’t have what it takes. And that’s what makes this book so powerful. It puts language to the things you’ve felt but couldn’t explain. It helps you name the subtle ways people can pull your strings. And it shows you how to take those strings back.

One line that really stuck with me was this

""Real change happens in moments of cognitive dissonance, when someone’s existing beliefs collide violently with new information that can’t be ignored.""

That’s exactly what reading this book felt like. Things I thought were just part of life suddenly looked like manipulation. I could see it clearly. Not just in other people, but also in how I had been letting it happen.

Yes, parts of the book repeat themselves, but honestly, I needed that. It helped things sink in. Sometimes the repetition made the ideas hit even harder. Especially when you’re unlearning beliefs that have been with you for years.

If you’ve ever walked out of a room and second-guessed yourself, if you've ever been made to feel like your instincts were wrong or your energy was too much or not enough, this book will find you where you are. And it will help you take back your voice.

This book helped me trust myself again. It helped me see the moments where I gave my power away, and more importantly, how to start taking it back. If you’ve ever felt like someone made you question who you are, or if you’ve ever walked away from a job, a relationship, or even a conversation feeling small and unsure why, this book is for you.

Highly recommend. Especially if you're at a turning point in your life and you want to finally start living it on your own terms.",1,1745917652.0,TheBookTribunal,0,1.0,False

And this friend recently told me, ""you are looking for someone who will both charm you and give you stability!"" and laughed. Is this too much to ask for? According to him, yes! Rarely, I see guys who seem to be nice, not perverted or commitment-phobic or anything like that, ""traditional men"" who focus on career, finding a life partner, and settling down. I matched with one such guy, and we have been having only small talk, there is no attraction that I feel for him, so I honestly don't feel like dating him or even meeting him for coffee. We have no common interests, what will we talk about if we meet? I told my friend that I find him boring. And again, rarely, I come across men who can seem perfect but they don't want commitment, not just now but most likely never. I have always felt like dating men who are not open to the idea of commitment would only be a waste of my time. So my friend is implying that I have to either learn to settle for the boring, traditional kind of guy if I want a husband, or just go do casual dating and never expect these men to commit to a serious, exclusive relationship at all and just have fun, or to stop dating and be single forever. I don't know how to take his comment - is he just being realistic and those are all the options we have ( 1) dull and boring but committed man, 2) fun guy who won't take you or the relationship seriously, 3) stop dating), or is he being patronizing and implying I/women like me ask for ""too much""?

I'm not concluding or ranting, please share your thoughts! Some of my female friends are in the stage where we want to give dating a try, and if we find the right partners, great, and if we don't, then we'll stop trying and focus entirely on career and our own hobbies.

My little one arrived 10 days ago (holy sleep deprivation, Batman!) and while I'm beyond happy, I'm also trying not to completely lose myself in the newborn chaos. Before baby, I was coding 8+ hours daily on various projects, and suddenly going cold turkey on building things was making me feel a bit lost.

So I challenged myself: make the most of those precious 1-2 hour windows when baby naps and my wife isn't asking me to grab more diapers/wipes/coffee/sanity.

**The Problem I Needed to Solve:**

For my main business, I constantly need to create social media ads for products, and it was eating up so much time. I'd spend forever in Canva trying to make product shots look good enough for Instagram/Facebook. With a newborn, that time is now nonexistent.

**The Solution:**

I built [quickAIAds.com](https://quickAIAds.com) \- upload a product image, and AI transforms it into professional social ads in seconds. No design skills needed.

Here's what it does:

* Takes your basic product photo
* Uses AI to generate multiple ad variations with different backgrounds, layouts, and text
* Creates ads sized perfectly for different platforms
* Handles all the design work automatically

Honestly, it's saving me about 90% of the time I used to spend on this stuff, which is crucial now that my work hours are measured in minutes between diaper changes.

**What I Learned:**

1. Newborns sleep a LOT (just never when you want them to)
2. Focused 2-hour coding blocks can be surprisingly productive
3. Building something that solves your own immediate problem is incredibly motivating

Would love any feedback from other parent-entrepreneurs on how you manage to keep building while in the newborn trenches. And if anyone needs a quick way to create social media ads, maybe my sleep-deprived invention can help you too.

After reading all your comments and thinking about it, I decided to meet him once

But before going further into the post, I think I need to clear out a few things.

Our relationship was never bitter. Even after the breakup, we never hated each other. In fact, it wasn’t even him who failed to take a stand for me it was me. I was much younger back then, with different priorities and dreams. I didn’t feel ready to settle, and he, being older and facing family pressure, was at a completely different stage. Despite everything, he was always supportive and respectful.

So… coming back to the present yes, I decided to meet him.

He had travelled to the city I currently live in, and we met for coffee. We ended up talking for hours. Life, career, regrets, how things unfolded. It turned out he never truly wanted to marry the woman he eventually did but he tried. He really tried. He told me she got involved in an extramarital affair and, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, they both decided a mutual divorce was best.

Of course, I didn’t just take his word for it. I asked questions, went through his phone and the divorce papers with his consent, and even did a little background check of my own. Everything checked out.

Right now! I want to be clear we are *not* together. Not dating. Not planning anything. But we are in touch.

When we parted that day, I hugged him. It was just a hug, but I could feel how heavy it was for him. He almost broke down. And I realized, in that moment, sometimes people come back not because they want to rewrite the past but because they want to be seen again, for who they are now.

I don’t know where this will go. But I know I’m walking into this with my eyes open.

A Deep Dive into Natural Folate vs. Synthetic Folic Acid","As a cadet pilot, ex-powerlifter, and self-proclaimed supplement nerd, I’ve spent more time than I care to admit comparing B9 forms—*folate* vs. *folic acid*—and how they impact real people with real lives (and possibly real tumors).

This isn’t fearmongering. It’s nuance. Because not all B9 is equal, and how you *absorb*, *use*, and *respond* to it depends on what you eat, your genetics, and how many ""one-a-day"" pills you stack each morning without blinking.

Let’s talk **mechanisms**, **dosing risks**, **MTHFR variants**, and the **quiet cancer signal** buried in meta-analyses most people never read past the abstract.

# 1. Folate 101: The MVP of Methylation & DNA Repair

Folate is the natural, bioactive form of Vitamin B9 found in food. It supports:

* **DNA synthesis & repair** — critical for high-turnover tissues like the gut lining, skin, immune system, and yes, muscle tissue.
* **Methylation** — a cellular process involved in detox, gene expression, neurotransmitter production, and epigenetics.
* **Homocysteine reduction** — low folate leads to homocysteine buildup, which is linked to cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline.

# 2. Folate vs. Folic Acid – Not Just Semantics

|Nutrient|Found In|Metabolism|Risk|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Folate**|Leafy greens, legumes, liver|Pre-activated, used immediately|Low|
|**Folic Acid**|Fortified foods, supplements|Requires conversion by DHFR enzyme|Risk of unmetabolized buildup|

Folic acid is **more stable** and better absorbed in the short term (\~1.7x more bioavailable), but at doses >400–800 μg/day, your **DHFR enzyme gets saturated**. This causes unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) to build up in plasma—especially problematic if you:

* Have **MTHFR polymorphisms**
* Have a history of hormone-sensitive cancers
* Are stacking fortified food, protein powders, multivitamins, and standalone folic acid

# 3. What the Research Actually Says (With Real Numbers)

|Study & Year|Population|Risk Change|What It Means|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[Stevens et al., 2012](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000653)|10 RCTs, 38,233 subjects|\+7 % overall (RR 1.07)|Slight bump—prostate up 24 % in one subgroup|
|[Qin et al., 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.28124)|13 RCTs, 49,406 subjects|±0 % (RR 1.05)|Basically neutral; melanoma risk down 53 %|
|[Li et al., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970215)|1.2 M women, cohort study|\+20 % at ≥1 mg/day|High doses clearly linked to higher cancer risk|

**Stevens et al., 2012 (10 RCTs, 38,233 participants):**

* Folic acid supplementation led to a **7% overall increase in cancer risk (RR 1.07)**
* Subgroup: **24% higher prostate cancer risk**

**Qin et al., 2013 (13 RCTs, 49,406 people):**

* No significant cancer increase overall
* Some cancer types like **melanoma decreased**—context matters

**Li et al., 2024 (Cohort of 1.2 million women):**

* **≥1 mg/day folic acid** was associated with a **20% increase in total cancer risk** over long-term use
* Not a randomized trial, but the sample size gives it weight

**Bottom Line:** The risk is not sky-high—but it’s not zero. If your lifetime baseline cancer risk is \~40%, then a **7–20%** ***relative*** **increase** means you’re now at **42.8–48%**. Not catastrophic—but definitely a reason to rethink daily megadoses.

# 4. MTHFR Polymorphisms: The Genetic Wild Card

The **MTHFR C677T variant** (common in up to 15–20% of South Asians) leads to **reduced enzymatic conversion of folic acid** into L-methylfolate (the usable form).

**Risks if you're C677T TT homozygous:**

* Low folate = DNA strand breaks, uracil misincorporation (Blount et al., 1997)
* High folic acid = unmetabolized buildup, methylation dysregulation

This isn’t pseudoscience. MTHFR variants are associated with:

* Increased risk of neural tube defects
* Mood disorders (via neurotransmitter pathways)
* Homocysteine elevation
* Possibly reduced detox efficiency

My pilot buddy Rajesh did a genetic test last year and turned up **C677T +/+**. Now he avoids synthetic folic acid entirely and uses **L-methylfolate** or **folate-rich meals** only.

# 5. The “Three D’s” of Folic Acid Risk

1. **Dose:** Most risk-linked studies use **1 mg/day**—that’s **2.5× the RDA** (400 μg). Some multivitamins go up to 5 mg.
2. **Duration:** Cancer takes time. Many trials run 5–7 years, but **tumors often develop over 10–15 years**.
3. **DNA Variants:** MTHFR, DHFR, and others affect how you process and retain folic acid. That “standard dose” isn’t standard for everyone.

# 6. Folate’s Paradoxical Effects on Cancer and Immunity

* **Low Folate = DNA Breakage:** Uracil is misincorporated, increasing chromosomal instability (Blount, 1997)
* **High Folate = Cell Growth Fuel:** Supports all fast-dividing cells—*including micro-tumors*
* **Immune Impact:** UMFA may **blunt NK (natural killer) cell activity**, reducing tumor surveillance (Troen et al., 2006)
* **Epigenetics:** Too much folate = **hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes**; too little = **global hypomethylation** (Crider et al., 2012)

It’s not about *more* or *less*. It’s about *balance*—especially if you’re stacking creatine, B12, and protein powders that already contain added B-vitamins.

# 7. Jay’s Real-World B9 Protocol (Lifter + Flyer Edition)

**1. Food-First Strategy:**

* **Breakfast:** Spinach + paneer sandwich + mint chutney
* **Lunch:** Chana chaat, coriander-heavy
* **Snack:** Homemade sprouts with lemon + chili

**2. Smart Supplementation:**

* **Only on gym or simulator days:** 400 μg folic acid (part of a B-complex)
* **No daily stacking of multivitamin + protein powders + fortified cereal**

**3. Labs I Track Yearly:**

* **Plasma folate + homocysteine + CBC**
* May consider **UMFA test** if trends emerge

**4. Contextual Modifiers:**

* Family history of **prostate or lymphoma**? Be more conservative
* Pregnant/planning pregnancy? Then yes—folic acid as prescribed is protective
* Vegan diet? You might need careful monitoring to avoid deficiency

# 8. Questions for the Sub:

* Anyone here get tested for **MTHFR** or **UMFA** levels? What did you change?
* Have you ever had **odd blood markers** after a period of high-dose folic acid?
* Do you **cycle B-vitamins** or just run them year-round?
* What’s your **favorite folate-rich meal** from your culture?

Was diagnosed with fibro a little over a year ago but it has definitely got worse in the last 6 months.

Prior to my latest physio releasing me from her care as she didnt know how to manage the up and downs of fibro she did mention the boom/bust cycle which I am very much guilty of.

For those not aware:

Boom- feeling good, low pain, see things that need to be done round the house or get invited to do activities 

To

Bust- did the above, maybe too much as you were feeling good and its caused a flare.

I am fairly social and as I put it- Im not dead yet- so on good days I will see friends (even if its for a coffee and mooch around TK Maxx) or clean my kitchen- normal stuff.

I feel like all Im doing lately is resting and afraid of a flare and not living any sort of life. Lately even doing a food shop is exhausting me 😟

TLDR- My question is- how do you not push yourself on the good day to prevent the bad?

so, i met this guy on facebook in the start of March, he sent a request and i added him , i dont usually add people on fb, but he seemed cute so why not ?

 he texted me after 3-4 days and since then we were texting each other, we met 3times and the dates were going really well, he showed warmth, attention, i knew he liked me. he was not hiding it especially on screen, the way he called me cute names, or how he cared for me, or how he flirted even. he was the initiator in everything . i just reciprocated it the way he gave me energy and feelings. 

so on the third date, when we were sitting in his car and everything felt all kinda romantic and .. deep, especially after our coffee date and i felt being closer to him, felt peace, and reassurance, he was playing with my fingers and we were quiet for a bit and my thought slipped away and i asked- why arent u touching me ? - of course i didnt mean kissing or anything, i just maybe gave him a hint that "" u know what, i like u too and u can at least touch me on my hair.."" but he said - '' i want to, i just dont wanna invade your personal space too soon. you'll experience it dont worry'' he smiled at me and we hugged. nothing  else happened. but idk guys was it too soon to ask? it was just a natural question.. because after that he kinda got distant. i was flying in Budapest for 6 days and he wasnt texting me the same.. so when i asked whats wrong he just said that he doesnt wanna rush things and he thinks i want him to be more expressive than he already is and on this stage he cant give more and he doesnt want me to think something else because he values relationships and treats them with respect. and yeah.. i replied with:\_"" thanks for telling me, i appreciate that u care this much, i dont wanna rush things either and it never was my intention''. but still after that he kinda texted me, kinda not. when i came back he got happy and was all warm and attentive that day , but on saturday he was absent , silent, i texted but he didnt answer, didnt even read my message.. so on sunday (literally two days ago) he texted me :'' hey i was thinking these days and i dont know if the "" feeling is not in me "" or we just have to go on our ways but i cant seem to go in the same rhythm with u in your feelings or vibes.. its not in me anymore. "" when i asked to explain further, he sent such an inane and absurd message, i got.. even more confused.."" i dont know, in my opinion when u showed that fast emotional attachment, i dont know it just.. something blocked in me since then, i dont know"" .. 

 Guys i swear he said phrase - i dont know- like 6 times in that sentence and well.. that was my answer. he did not want it anymore and..i started thinking , blaming mself. did my question make him feel that way?? so  i told him that its just the way i am , i am emotional, i care, and when i see that someone is such attentive and caring towards me as u were, i just gave u the same. so just because i texted u with warmth and care , it doesnt mean i got attached to you, it just means that i wanted to care for you. and when u want to be with someone you just fight no matter how big or tiny the obstacles are and i know that this may be the early stages of a relationship but thats why we have to communicate, to know each others language, what pace should we dive deep into and which party wants what. "" but he left me on read. hasnt even responded. his silence means so much more than words he could have ever said.. and i got sad, my hurt broke because he made me trust him , talked to me about all the serious future-oriented stuff, acted as a gentleman, was caring, attentive, warm.  he even flirted in a way i started to think was he rushing or not..HE INITIATED EVERYTHING IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.  HE wanted to see me soo soon after we started texting but i kinda backed off and told him i needed much more time. and when he made me like him, made me feel all this care.. he got scared because i felt too much too soon? bulshit, i didnt even love him yet but yes i cared, yes i wanted to know how he was, i wanted his good morning texts and i wanted his reassurance that  HE WAS IN THIS WITH ME! was i asking too much?? it is the bare minimum, it is bare! he was like that from the begining, he was...  but no, he chickened out when things started to get even more serious. and it showed me what a man he truly was. 

 im not sad, i gotten over him. im just... pissed off because it sucks when they say the things they want and then act different. 

what do u think of all this?

“Mark Carney didn’t win, okay?” Trump shouted during a late-night Truth Social livestream filmed in front of a poorly Photoshopped Canadian flag. “The election was stolen! Just like 2020—only colder! This was worse than what happened to me, folks. Worse than NAFTA. I hereby declare Pierre Poilievre the rightful Prime Minister of Canada!”

The president urged Canadian Conservatives and “freedom-loving hockey fans” to assemble in Ottawa and “stop the steal” before the new Parliament could be sworn in.

Within hours, a convoy of pickup trucks, snowmobiles, and rogue Zambonis converged on **Parliament Hill**, waving MAGA flags, Confederate flags, and oddly, Leafs jerseys. The crowd attempted to scale the Peace Tower using a makeshift ladder made of hockey sticks and Tim Hortons cups.

Shouts of **“Make Canada Free Again!”**, **“Carney is a Communist!”**, and **“Release the Maple Memos!”** echoed through downtown Ottawa.

One protester, wearing a raccoon hat and shouting from atop a mounted moose statue, yelled, “I came here for liberty and a poutine, and I ain’t seen neither!”

Canadian authorities, confused and mostly polite, initially attempted to de-escalate the situation by offering apologies and coffee. RCMP officers were later seen gently escorting rioters away while explaining Section 91 of the Constitution.

Meanwhile, Trump praised the chaos from Mar-a-Lago.

“What we’re seeing in Canada is beautiful,” he posted. “Just like January 6—only snowier. The people want Poilievre! We’re going to MAKE CANADA TRUMP AGAIN!”

Prime Minister-elect Mark Carney responded with a brief statement: “We thank Mr. Trump for his input. It will be filed accordingly — in the recycling bin.”

**UPDATE:** Trump has reportedly announced plans to open a golf resort in Saskatchewan and is considering launching a new political movement: **The Maple America First Party (MAFP).**",9,1745916661.0,onionheadlines,0,0.91,False

At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. I was drowning in productivity advice while being completely unproductive. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of these sequential habits but none of the apps I found really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn. It’s now [available to download on the app store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498) Feel free to reach out with any feedback that you might have on the app if you decide to try it out.

Ironically, drinking more coffee made me feel less anxious and generally happier. I don't have to rush to have coffee after taking modafinil because adding l-theanine has helped to reduce my anxiousness. I was taking them from liefextensions and highstreetpharma.

The problem is that I'm not seeing the same memory and cognitive benefits with bacopa as I did during my six-week tolerance break before switching to modafinil and taking Adderall. Do modafinil and bacopa have any known or suspected interactions? How has the overall experience been? Past routine:

Morning: Adderall XR 20mg (Dx w/ADHD &Narcolepsy type 2)+Bacopa 320mg(Synapsa)+Magtein (split dose)+Coffee Afternoon: Multi+Omega Evening: Magtein (split dose)+Lamictal 150mg (off-label for anxiety&depression)

This combo worked really well, my memory and cognitive functions were sharp, the only issue was that the Adderall kinda gave a runaway train-type focus. I'd lose time on random stuff, struggled with task switching, and just felt like I wasn't intentional with my actions.

Current routine:

Morning: Modafinil 200mg(3 times a week)+Bacopa (Synapsa)+Magtein+L-theanine 200mg(Suntheanine) +Coffee Afternoon&Evening same as above.

I feel like this combo is a mix bag. My focus is less strong, my cognitive/memory function a bit worse, & baseline mood lower but I feel more in control of myself.

* **Eat your B9** (spinach, rajma, chana) like your DNA depends on it—because it does.
* **Don’t overdo synthetic folic acid (≥1 mg/day):** most big trials show a modest 7–20 % bump in cancer risk ([Stevens et al., 2012](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000653); [Li et al., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970215)).
* **Key factors:** how much you take, how long you take it, your genetics, and whether you already have tiny lesions.
* **My rule of thumb:** unless you’re pregnant or truly deficient, get Folate from real food, not a pill jar.

# 1) Why Folate Is Your B9 MVP

Think of folate as the “OG Vitamin B9,” the one your body actually recognizes and loves. It’s in all the good stuff:

* Spinach omelets on sleepy mornings
* Rajma simmering on a rainy day
* Your grandma’s dal, spiced just right

Folate helps build and repair DNA—like having a dedicated pit crew for your cells. Fast-turnover tissues (gut lining, skin, hair) can’t run without it.

# 2) Folate vs. Folic Acid: The Tale of Two B9s

# Natural Folate

* **Source:** Leafy greens, beans, lentils.
* **Pros:** Easily used by your body.
* **Anecdote:** I once skipped breakfast before a 6 AM simulator check and felt queasy—turns out my body was literally crying out for folate from that spinach-paneer omelet I ditched.

# Synthetic Folic Acid

* **Source:** Pills and “fortified” flour.
* **Pros:** Absorbed about 1.7× better than food folate.
* **Cons:** When you slam ≥1 mg at once, unmetabolized folic acid floats in your blood—and that might nourish tiny tumors you didn’t even know were there ([Lucock, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1006/mgme.2000.3029)).

**WWII Flashback:** In the 1940s, antifolate drugs like methotrexate were discovered by accident. They starve cancer cells by blocking folate. Could the opposite—extra folic acid—feed cancer? Biology rarely flips a simple on/off switch.

# 3) The Numbers—But, Like, Actually Understandable Ones

|Study & Year|Population|Risk Change|What It Means|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[Stevens et al., 2012](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000653)|10 RCTs, 38,233 subjects|\+7 % overall (RR 1.07)|Slight bump—prostate up 24 % in one subgroup|
|[Qin et al., 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.28124)|13 RCTs, 49,406 subjects|±0 % (RR 1.05)|Basically neutral; melanoma risk down 53 %|
|[Li et al., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970215)|1.2 M women, cohort study|\+20 % at ≥1 mg/day|High doses clearly linked to higher cancer risk|

Quick math: If your baseline lifetime cancer risk is 40 %, a 7 % relative increase pushes you to about 42.8 %—not earth-shattering, but worth thinking about if you’re popping mega-doses.

# 4) The “Three D’s” of Folate Risk

1. **Dose:** Most studies used 1 mg/day—five times the RDA. ([Bailey & Gregory, 1999](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/129/4/779/4722555))
2. **Duration:** Trials ran 5–7 years, but tumors often take 10+ years to show up.
3. **DNA Variants:** If you’re an MTHFR TT homozygote, too little folate → DNA breaks; too much → over-methylation. ([Blount et al., 1997](https://www.pnas.org/content/94/7/3290))

My pilot buddy Rajesh once did a genetic test and discovered he’s a C677T variant. Now he sticks to food sources and only crashes a 400 μg multivitamin on cross-country flights.

# 5) How Folate Pulls Double Duty

* **Low Folate → DNA Chaos:** Uracil sneaks into DNA, causing breaks. ([Blount et al., 1997](https://www.pnas.org/content/94/7/3290))
* **High Folate → Cell Growth Fuel:** Gives every fast-dividing cell—from healing wounds to microscopic tumor clones—a feast.
* **Immune Impact:** Excess unmetabolized folic acid may blunt your natural killer cells’ ability to hunt down rogue cells. ([Troen et al., 2006](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/136/1/189/4664064))
* **Epigenetics:** Too much folate = hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes; too little = global hypomethylation. ([Crider et al., 2012](https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/3/1/21/4591584))

# 6) Jay’s Real-World B9 Playbook

1. **Food First:**
   * Breakfast: Spinach-paneer omelet with mint chutney
   * Lunch: Chana chaat loaded with coriander & cumin
2. **Smart Supplementation:**
   * Gym days only: 400 μg folic acid in my multivitamin
   * No 5 mg “bulletproof” pills—those are for people who hate nuance
3. **Annual Labs:** CBC + plasma folate. If unmetabolized folic acid shows up, I dial back.
4. **Family History Check:** Prostate or lymphoma in the family? Keep doses modest unless your doc says otherwise.

# 7) What’s Next & Your Turn

* **Future Research:** We need 15–20-year, genotype-stratified RCTs comparing 0.4 mg vs. 4 mg folic acid—good luck finding funders.
* **N-of-1 Experiments:** Anyone tried home epigenetic kits to track folate metabolism?

1kaiull,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kaiull/i_fell_in_love_with_a_girl_whos_currently_taking/,I fell in love with a girl who's currently taking a break from romance because of a past heartbreak.,"For context, this girl is part of the same circle of friends that I'm on. We were former coworkers at a previous company last year. She was cute but I was never really attracted or had feelings for her before. We never really talked much until our mutual friends/coworkers decided to hang out much more often these past few months. 

This girl... she's just full of adventure and passion. I already knew this fact because we're also friends on Facebook and Instagram. She loves to hike, travel outdoors, and go to the most breathtaking sceneries around the country. That's probably one of the main reasons why I fell for her. But the moment that really hit the nail for me was when we finally went on a mountain hike together, along with our mutual friend. When I first saw her during that day, it was like lightning just struck me. And it's kind of weird because I didn't find her this beautiful in the past. Also, the way she talks is very gravitating and the way she smiles is probably the biggest factor because her eyes literally disappear when she smiles. It's too adorable.

Admittedly, I also just came from a breakup last December but my ex and I ended the relationship on good terms that's why I must've moved on much quicker. 

Anyway, my feelings for this girl became deeper after the hike. I started to think about her much more often. Then, one day I decided to muster up all my courage and asked her to have a cup of coffee with me. Fortunately, she agreed. I was so nervous deep inside because it was the first time that I'm going to talk to a girl that I really like after a long time. Luckily for me, we've had a great time catching up on each other's lives and getting to know each other much better.

But here's the catch, I asked her that day if she's currently dating anyone right now and she replied she doesn't have one. Then I followed up with another question, ""Are you open to being in a relationship right now?""
Which then she replied, ""I'm not really thinking about those kind of things right now. I'm more into self-love lately."" 
Which prompted me to ask when her last relationship was. She then answered that it was also just last year.

I know this story is a bit long for just explaining the context, but I just really need some thoughts or insights from you guys/ladies about this because I really like this girl and I don't want to come off as desperate. I'd really appreciate any kind of advice or words from you all.",2,1745914703.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
