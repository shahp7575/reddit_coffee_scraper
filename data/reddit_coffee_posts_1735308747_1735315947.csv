Until recently..

I don‚Äôt use dating apps anymore but all of a sudden women have just been throwing themselves at me; they come on strong and fast without getting to know me properly: 

-One girl recently bought me a coffee and said i owe her one back, suggestively. 
-another said i look like machine gun kelly, i told her it was flattering and she said ‚Äúyea he‚Äôs really hot‚Äù. 
-then one asked me when my next concert is in her area so she can throw her bra at me. 
-some girl from work bought me fish and chips because i said i‚Äôm hungry, and expressed very clearly that she wants me to sleep with her. 
-the most recent girl ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô added me on socials, messaged me apologising and she later confessed she likes me and wants to go on a date

I‚Äôve been dating someone when all this attention has happened. We‚Äôre getting to know each other and i told her i‚Äôd like to date but not sleep with others while we do. She is extremely invested - wrote me an invasively personal poem after our 2nd date, bought me small gifts etc. her high interest is simultaneously flattering but off putting, it makes me think the grass could be greener but she‚Äôs very sweet.

My question is - as someone who hasn‚Äôt experienced anywhere near this much attention and doesn‚Äôt fall in love easy, should i just play the game by sleeping around and breaking some hearts? Would it be wrong to pass up this opportunity to enjoy my 20‚Äôs? Or should i just keep waiting it out until i find a girl i can clearly imagine a future with? 

My end goal is a LTR, the option with the least drama would be to date them one by one, whilst continuing to be honest, but i fear i‚Äôd become indecisive again and think about other options out of boredom. The fun option of shamelessly sleeping around is tempting and something i‚Äôve also never experienced, but could backfire if they think i‚Äôm only after one thing - being a player has always been something i‚Äôve tried to avoid.",1,1735315769.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Thanks in advance. Please rate my everything- from the set up to the shot. 
I should have taken a video so you can see the entire process.

I only got the grinder at Christmas and my Coffeeworks beans arrived today so just used it. 

I ground quite fine between 4/5 (cos I always see ‚Äògrind finer‚Äô on here). I tried to level it in PF but I wasn‚Äôt very successful, so that‚Äôs why it isn‚Äôt very smooth in the 2nd photo. I then tried to level it by tamping really hard. I also used a WDF tool as it came out a bit clumpy from the grinder. 

I used a puck screen. I see people use it so I did üòÜ but I notice that when I do, the coffee takes time to come out and I have to push the button again before it actually starts flowing.
At 13 seconds I only had 1.5gm of coffee in the cup, so had to push the buttons again. At the end of it I had about 16gms so not quite 1:2. 

The 3rd photo is the finished product which looked nice with a good crema but the espresso was a bit too bitter for my liking. The beans I used was only roasted on the 24th of December. 

What are your thoughts? I love coffee but I‚Äôm only just settling down to really enjoy espresso while going down this delightful rabbit hole!

I didn‚Äôt gain anything over Christmas but I‚Äôve kind of stalled out a bit this month.  I‚Äôve had a bad cold so my exercise had to get cut down the last week or so. 

Zepbound Christmas was interesting - I ate food and stopped and that‚Äôs unlike me on Christmas.  If I went over I had Indigestion and heartburn so it‚Äôs clear that I can‚Äôt overeat anymore not that I want to. 

I still love cooking but my obsession has switched to quality over quantity - if I‚Äôm going to make something I want it to be really good not just meh. 

MIL did notice my weight loss at Christmas which felt great as I went to my in-laws in a size 18 pair of jeans.  Hubby bought me gift cards for clothes so I can get new stuff as I continue to lose. 

Considering how rapid my loss was in October and November I figured I‚Äôd hit a stall at some point which I seem to have - but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even been long enough to be a stall. 

Aside from this nasty cold, I feel great.  Tolerating 10mg well and did this morning‚Äôs shot.  Nausea hasn‚Äôt been too bad and I eat ginger pieces to deal with it.  Constipation seems to be manageable with hot coffee in the mornings and Metamucil gummies and the occasional dose of colace. 

So nothing huge this week but I‚Äôm happy to at least be maintaining over the holidays.

Sorry to disappear for so long! Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been two years since I posted that. I was in such a dark place. Wish I could go back and tell him how much better life got. Let‚Äôs catch you all up. 

After I got back Jenny tried to come over and apologize. She came over one night in in late December knocked on my door and tried to tell me I was overreacting until the neighbors told her to shut up. I did open the door long enough to give her the box of her stuff she had left. She never did return the favor. Haven‚Äôt seen her since she left. Lost my favorite hoodie but life goes on. 

Not long after this I was getting groceries when I ran into Molly (then 24 now 26F). Molly worked with Jenny and we had talked at their Christmas party. Molly had heard about the breakup and let‚Äôs just say she aggressively wanted to take me to coffee. She knew what she wanted and she wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. It was a bit much not going to lie but coffee with her was exactly what I needed. Mostly because she is exactly what I wanted, needed, she was everything. 

I guess I‚Äôm one of those guys that never wants to be single. Molly and I have been together for two years now, living together for one and recently we found out she was pregnant! We are overjoyed. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was planned but not like we were doing much to avoid it either.

Now to the dilemma. My life is so much better, I haven‚Äôt heard from my parents and Molly has respected that. She blocked all my relatives when I asked and has had no contact. But of course somehow my mother found out. She sent a box of my old baby stuff along with a letter asking that I let her see the baby. I kept the baby stuff, it was mine after all, but threw the letter away without responding. 

I thought that would be the end of it but then my sister showed up at my doorstep. Molly answered the door and of course had no idea who this crazy lady is but Molly kind of lost the upper hand when she started crying and let her in. My sister said she missed me and that Stacy and my brother got married last year, and she and her dad didn‚Äôt go. Apparently my mom and dad are separated but not divorced, my sister is engaged and Stacy found out recently she can‚Äôt have kids. 

I told my sister once again that I was no longer apart of the family but she said her and our dad really want to make it up to me. That she is not inviting her mom or her brother to the wedding. She said my dad could come down this weekend to talk. 

Molly said she understands how hurt I am, and knows that they crossed many boundaries but maybe it‚Äôs time to forgive. She didn‚Äôt push though. Stated she supports me either way. I just don‚Äôt know. What do you all think? I know from the stories that my dad and sister disagreed with my mom. Growing up my mom controlled the house and my brother was my mom‚Äôs favorite. My sister is my dad‚Äôs favorite so if my sister is on board, then my dad probably is too. 

I‚Äôm torn. Help me out please. Any advice is appreciated. ",5,1735315424.0,stories,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------

After whitening your teeth, one of the most common questions that people have is, ""How long after whitening teeth can I eat?"" It‚Äôs crucial to understand the right waiting period to ensure you maintain that sparkling smile. This article will clarify how you can protect your newly whitened teeth while enjoying your meals.

Typically, dental professionals recommend waiting at least 30 minutes after a teeth whitening session before eating. The reason behind this waiting period lies in the whitening agent used during the treatment. When you whiten your teeth, the enamel becomes temporarily porous, and consuming food too soon can lead to staining or sensitivity.

### Reasons for Waiting After Teeth Whitening

Here are some reasons why it's essential to wait:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Porous Enamel:** Teeth whitening treatments open up the pores in the enamel. Eating immediately can introduce pigments from food and drinks that might stain your teeth.
- **Increased Sensitivity:** Many people experience tooth sensitivity after whitening. Eating or drinking hot or cold items too soon can amplify this discomfort.
- **Optimal Results:** Waiting ensures you achieve the best whitening results. Eating too soon can compromise the treatment.

### What to Avoid After Teeth Whitening

To keep your teeth looking their best post-whitening, you should avoid certain foods and beverages temporarily:

- **Dark-Colored Foods:** Foods like blueberries, blackberries, and sauces like soy sauce can lead to staining.
- **Coffee and Tea:** Both beverages can leave your teeth looking dull if consumed immediately after treatment.
- **Carbonated Drinks:** These contain acidity that can erode enamel, making your teeth more susceptible to staining.

### What Can You Eat Safely?

While you need to be cautious, there are some food choices that you can enjoy safely:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Soft, Light-Colored Foods:** Foods like bananas, yogurt, and white rice are safe during the waiting period.
- **Non-Staining Vegetables:** Cooked vegetables like cauliflower or potatoes won't stain your teeth.
- **Water:** Staying hydrated is always a good choice, and water won‚Äôt cause any stains!

### Post-Whitening Care

After waiting the recommended time, brushing your teeth gently can help remove any residual whitening gel. It‚Äôs essential to follow a good oral hygiene routine to maintain the effects of whitening. Here are a few extra tips:

- **Use a Soft-Bristled Toothbrush:** This can help reduce sensitivity while maintaining a clean mouth.
- **Fluoride Mouthwash:** This can strengthen your enamel post-whitening.
- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Keeping in touch with your dentist ensures that your smile stays healthy and bright.

### Final Thoughts

Waiting about 30 minutes after whitening your teeth before eating is the best approach. This waiting period protects the integrity of your whitening treatment and helps to keep your teeth free from unwanted stains. Always choose lighter-colored foods and drinks during this time, and take special care of your teeth. Following these guidelines will help ensure your teeth remain bright and your smile stays radiant!

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Whether it‚Äôs your first time whitening or you‚Äôre a seasoned pro, knowing how long to wait can make a significant difference in the results. If you have further questions or concerns about your specific situation, don‚Äôt hesitate to consult your dentist.

Foods to Avoid After Teeth Whitening for Optimal Results
--------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôve recently undergone teeth whitening, congratulations! You're on your way to a brighter smile. However, to maintain those optimal results, it‚Äôs essential to consider what you consume after the treatment. Certain foods can stain or hinder the effectiveness of your newly whitened teeth. Here‚Äôs what you should avoid.

### Highly Pigmented Foods

Foods with intense colors can quickly undo the work of whitening treatments. Here are some to be cautious about:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Berries:** Blueberries, blackberries, and cherries can stain your teeth due to their deep pigments.
- **Beets:** This vibrant root vegetable is known for its staining properties.
- **Dark chocolate:** While it can be a healthier sweet treat, the darker the chocolate, the greater the risk of discoloration.

### Certain Beverages

Drinks can be just as harmful as foods when it comes to maintaining your newly whitened teeth. Avoid these popular beverages:

- **Red wine:** Its rich color and acidity can lead to staining.
- **Coffee and tea:** Both are notorious for causing yellowing over time. If you must drink them, consider using a straw.
- **Cola and other dark sodas:** The dark pigments can easily cling to your enamel.

### Acidic Foods

Acidic items can make your teeth more vulnerable to stains right after whitening. Be wary of:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Citrus fruits:** Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits can wear down enamel, making it easier for stains to set in.
- **Pineapple:** While delicious, its acidity can be harsh on your teeth.
- **Vinegar-based dressings:** These can create sensitivity and may lead to staining.

### Colored Sauces and Condiments

The sauces you use can also contribute to staining. It's best to stay away from:

- **Soy sauce:** This savory staple is a known culprit for staining.
- **Ketchup:** Its red color can diminish your results.
- **Curry sauces:** The vibrant yellow hue can be tough to remove.

### Other Foods to Avoid

In addition to the items listed above, consider steering clear of:

- **Colored candies:** These often contain artificial dyes that can easily stain your teeth.
- **Ice cream and colored desserts:** Brightly colored treats can leave traces of pigmentation on your enamel.
- **Sports drinks:** These often contain high levels of both sugar and colorants, contributing to stains.

### Timing Is Everything

After whitening your teeth, it‚Äôs typically best to wait at least 24 to 48 hours before consuming any foods or drinks that could affect your results. This allows your enamel some time to recover and makes it less porous, reducing the potential effects of staining. The longer you wait, the better your results can be!

Keeping your teeth white after a whitening treatment is about both timing and choices. While it may be tempting to indulge in certain foods or beverages, being mindful can extend the longevity of your bright smile. Always remember to maintain good dental hygiene and consult your dentist with any concerns about your diet after whitening.

By staying away from highly pigmented, acidic, and richly colored foods and drinks, you give your freshly whitened teeth the best chance to shine and stay bright. Enjoy your new smile and make choices that support it!

### Conclusion

When it comes to your newly whitened smile, patience truly is a virtue. Allowing the recommended waiting period of at least 30 minutes to two hours after teeth whitening not only helps your teeth absorb the whitening agents effectively but also ensures that you preserve the results you've worked hard to achieve. Your newly brightened teeth are more porous immediately following treatment, making them susceptible to staining from food and beverages.

To maintain that dazzling look, it's essential to be mindful of what you eat in the hours after whitening. Steer clear of vibrant foods and drinks, like coffee, red wine, and dark berries, which can quickly counteract the benefits of your whitening session. Opt for lighter-colored foods and beverages, and always rinse your mouth with water after consuming anything potentially staining.

By understanding the timeline and the types of foods to avoid, you can ensure your bright smile lasts longer. The extra care taken in the hours following your treatment will allow you to enjoy the boost in confidence that comes with a brighter smile. Keep these pointers in mind for a successful whitening experience, and you‚Äôll enjoy the benefits of a radiant and stunning smile for an extended period. Remember, a little caution goes a long way in preserving that fresh, vibrant look!",1,1735314796.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I had a lot of trauma growing up but it was the one day growing up that was about us and everyone treated us amazing. So I‚Äôve always loved my birthday. So I‚Äôm married and have been for 3 years. My husband (m26)  thinks birthday are just another day and nothing special and don‚Äôt matter. But for his birthday I go all out. Decorate, banner, homemade cake, gifts lined up, ect. And this year I had a couples trip planned and coordinated childcare a month in advance and booked the Airbnb 2 months in advance. Whole 9. 

But since I know he doesn‚Äôt care about that stuff I didn‚Äôt expect much- more like a cake, present, and dinner. But the day comes and he said his plans fell thre because he didn‚Äôt plan for child care (and he knows I didn‚Äôt want to have to take care of the kids whole time), he didn‚Äôt think about getting a cake (even though he went to the store), and he said he ordered a present and it just hadn‚Äôt delivered but that doesn‚Äôt really matter. 

So I voiced how I was feeling and he got super mad me and said I was high maintenanced. And I told him that didnt even care about the day any more just wanted a cake because he had instilled the mindset that birthdays don‚Äôt matter. And he said I was being manipulative. And I said he just doesn‚Äôt care about anything unless it‚Äôs convenient for him. And that was last night. Then this morning I mad coffee mine and his cup, got the boys fed, changed, and set up for the day. And he walked in all depressed like and I asked what‚Äôs wrong. And he said he was still really upset about last night.

When I woke up and rolled out of bed I walked to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee, then I noticed the front and back door were missing, replaced by the baby blue wallpaper my wife had picked out 8 years prior. immediately panicking I ran over to the window above the sink and practically ripped open the curtains, what I saw made my stomach churn. it was all black, a starless void that I can only describe as limitless. It was even black where the light reflections on the glass should've been. I frantically ran around the entire house checking every window, what I saw was the same empty void as the first one.

That was two days ago. I've tried smashing the windows, clawing my way out, calling the police, and even suicide, but for some reason I cannot escape. 

Today was when I figured out what was truly happening. my skin, My skin is peeling off at an unnatural pace, I'm only writing this to keep my hands busy as to not peel off the rest of it. My hair is falling out too, a few strands fell out, and I noticed that when they hit the floor, they slowly turned to small lines of brown liquid, I looked around what used to be my house and noticed that all the flakes of skin that had fallen or been peeled off were replaced by a liquid matching it's pale color.

I wiped up the lost bits of myself and sat on the couch. And that's where I am now, writing this.

\[Part 3\](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fxp47e/im\_a\_marine\_biologist\_working\_for\_the\_canadian/)

Okay, a lot has happened within the past 48 hours, so bear with me. I don't know what to think about what has happened, just how awful it turned out. What had started as a simple investigation had quickly become a nightmarish scenario that will haunt me to the day I die, unable to not see the faces of the deceased and not feel guilt as the only two survivors of what the public is now calling the Amity disaster. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.

It was quiet that night after we had bolted everything down, save for the waves and imminent thunder on the horizon. It was pretty unlikely that anyone was going to get any sleep, and so we sat around and quietly talked, trying to take our minds off of what will inevitably happen. At some point, while the sun was starting it's way back into the sky, I was approached by Lawrence.

""You saved me back there, thank you,"" Lawrence said as he sat down next to me and Ellen, ""I...I'm sorry for the way I've been acting towards you two. It's been years since I lived in the environment I grew up in, but old habits really do die hard. That being said, there should be no excuse for my behaviour.""

""I appreciate you apologizing, just please don't stop trying to be a better person,"" Ellen replied, her words ringing out with sincerity, ""People change people, and people do change, just don't give up on yourself.""

I nodded in agreement with my wife, and we soon switched to other topics to talk about. We carried on, not knowing that this would be the last time I ever spoke with both of them. Unfortunately, however, it was only an hour later when the Amity was suddenly hit by an immense force that damaged the Amity's hull and sent the eleven of us scattering for cover. Shortly after, the object that hit us revealed itself to be Bruce's tail as it retracted out of the ship and rain began pouring inside.

""Shit, we've been breached!"" Dylan called out, grabbing a harpoon, ""All hands on deck, get to your battle stations!""

We all began to arm ourselves on our way to the deck of the ship ready to defend ourselves from the massive Dragon who was now looming overhead, his eyes filled with the same level of rage and contempt that I had seen the last time he was this close. The ship's guns were aimed directly at Bruce, ready to fire at a moment's notice. For a few moments, nobody moved after we got into position. Glancing around I can tell everyone was quite unnerved by this whole scenario. Sure, this crew had faced plenty of conflicts, from searching for rogue underwater mines to saving boats from wayward pirates. No one was truly prepared to come into contact with a Sea Dragon, since before this whole investigation began we didn't even know they existed. And none of us were prepared to fight one either, nevertheless we were willing to fight for the sake of ourselves and those back home. All to prevent Bruce from taking any more lives.

Little to no words were spoken throughout the ensuing fight against Bruce. Granted, it wasn't like there was much for any of us to say anyways, since the Dragon didn't seem like much of a talker. Rather, he let out a loud roar as he swung his massive tail at the Amity again. We were prepared this time, however, and started firing the guns at the beast in order to slow him down. While they did hit him, the ammunition didn't really do that much to stop the tail from smacking five crewmates off of the deck. They didn't get the chance to hit the water before they were snatched out of the air in rapid succession by the serpent's massive jaws.

He then turned his attention to the ship's guns with a look of rage as he prepared his next attack, but it was far from what we expected. Instead of hitting the ship with his tail a third time, we watched in horror as Bruce's gills and mouth began to glow bright blue before a massive jet of boiling hot water blasted from his jaws and swiped right across the deck. With each thing it passed by, the jet proceeded to carve through like a hot knife through butter, causing serious damage. As I was at one of the guns that were hit, I was nearly close to finding out the hard way what would happen if it connected with living tissue before I was pushed out of the way just in the nick of time.

Much to my horror, I heard a loud thud behind me as my rescuer collapsed, having not been as lucky to move away from the blast in time. I braced myself and opened my eyes, only to let out a shriek upon seeing Matt's decapitated body limp next to me. There wasn't even any blood, as if the blast had cauterized where his head had been burned off. I then saw movement out of the corner of my eye, and looked up to see Tia standing above me, her hand covering her mouth. She didn't say anything, but the horrified look of grief in her eyes was more than enough to suggest that she had just witnessed her fiance die right in front of her. There were tears in her eyes as she fell to her knees and let out a cry of anguish while holding Matt's corpse. I then watched as, through the howling winds and roars of thunder, the tears of anguish slowly morphed into snarls of rage before she slowly stood up, ran towards the edge of the Amity and dived straight into the chaotic water. A second had barely passed after she hit the water before the sounds of the hurricane were dwarfed by a beastly roar so loud that it caused everyone onboard to hold their ears in pain, before another Sea Dragon of similar size to Bruce rose out of the ocean.

I find it difficult to completely explain what happened next, for right after Tia rose back out of the water she immediately turned her attention towards Bruce and everything descended into chaos.If it wasn't bad enough to be attacked by a giant monster in the middle of a storm in the middle of the ocean, the Amity had now found itself caught in the middle of a fight between two mythical beasts. Having worked in my career as long as I have, I've been caught in the middle of fights between marine life before. I've seen hammerheads fighting a pack of dolphins, witnessed a whale fighting off a giant squid. All of those scenarios made me feel relatively small, but in comparison to the two Dragons battling it out in the hurricane, the crew of the Amity might as well have been ants. Our attacks on Bruce had already proven practically useless, and now the most we could do is take cover and hope to not get caught in the crossfire.

Needless to say, that was easier said than done, and those 48 hours were filled with several casualties. Tragically, my wife and her uncle were eventually counted among the dead by the time everything was over. Ellen was struck in the head by a life boat knocked loose by another slap on the ship by Bruce's tail, snapping her neck and killing her instantly. Dylan wasn't so lucky (if I can even call it that), for another blast of boiling water had left his bisected corpse falling into the water. Death after death, life taken after life taken. I knew every single person on that ship, with some even having a personal connection with. Before this investigation had began, I could recognize all of their faces. Now, as I'm typing this, their faces are all I can see, along with images in my mind of their dead bodies.

At some point, I can't remember when, another hit to the boat had tore open the hull on the bottom, causing the Amity to slowly start to sink. What I didn't notice, however, but Lawrence had noticed, is that the same hit had opened up the chamber where the Amity was keeping its torpedoes. They were on board and rarely used, with Dylan having previously told me that they were only to be used if another ship were to attack us.

""How powerful are these?"" I just barely heard him ask over the roaring of the two Dragons and the now dying down thunder as the hurricane passed us over.

I looked him dead in the eyes, catching on to what he was thinking as I replied, ""Just one is enough to sink a battleship.""

With a nod to each other, we swiftly ran to the chamber and together picked up one a torpedo and went to load it, only to find ourselves with a problem. In the midst of the fighting, one of the water blasts had melted the metal on the launcher, effectively welding it shut.

I began to get a sinking feeling as a dark look formed in the representative's eyes as he said, ""Whatever happens next, get to the turret and shoot the torpedo once he's got it in his teeth.""

""Larry, don't you dare-""

""Just fucking do it! Don't worry about me!"" He cut off my protest, before he dragged the torpedo out of the gun chamber on his own and managed to get on deck with it and used some nearby rope to tie it to himself.

Before I could say anything else, Lawrence began shouting and waving his arms to get Bruce's attention. At this point Tia wasn't in sight, and I had no idea if she was alive or not in that very moment. With her not fighting him, however, that gave the beast time to turn his attention to us. The Sea Dragon was staring at Lawrence running around on the deck of the sinking ship, reminding me of a snake staring down a mouse about to become its next meal. It didn't take long for the serpentine sea monster to slowly pull back and coil into himself before his massive head launched forward, and the last time I saw Lawrence alive was him giving me a thumbs up seconds before he disappeared completely behind the rows of enormous teeth.

I wanted to scream, cry, or throw up, or some mix of all three. Before this investigation had begun there were fifteen people on the Amity, and over the course of this endeavour I had witnessed the deaths of every single person I had either known personally or had even also grown up with. And now, with Tia's fate unknown to me at that moment, I had just witnessed Lawrence - who for the longest time I had considered a jerk but over the course of this trip proved that he was wanting to and willing to try to be a better person - intentionally sacrifice himself in order to give me a chance to kill the monster responsible for his death and that of everyone else.

But I couldn't do that, I couldn't give up now. Not when I could see the torpedo was lodged in Bruce's mouth. Knowing what I had to do, I booked it back to where the firearms were kept and grabbed a rifle, having to push through gushing sea water as I did. Thankfully the gun was dry and didn't suffer any water damage, but I didn't have time to worry about that as I booked it back on deck just to see Bruce lunging towards me, jaw open wide. Just then, Tia lunged back out of the water and latched onto the other Sea Dragon by the nape of his neck, yanking him back into the water to continue the fight.

*Don't you dare hesitate, I'll keep him in place!* I heard Tia's voice in my head as out loud she snarled.

Snapping out of my fear, I waded through the water as swiftly as possible and began climbing up to the crow's nest. As soon as I reached the nest I held on tight to the guard rail and loaded a bullet into the rifle. Lifting it up to my shoulder and looking down the scope, I found myself constantly adjusting my aim in order to keep up with the battle. With Tia and Bruce constantly thrashing around in the water, locking onto the spot on the torpedo where I knew its trigger would be was proving to be quite difficult much to my frustration. It was right there in his teeth but with their fight he kept opening and closing his mouth.

""Oh fuck's sake smile you son of a-"" I exclaimed and, acting quickly the second I had a long enough opening, put the torpedo' dead in my sights and pulled the trigger.

For a moment, there was silence, leaving me unsure about whether or not I'd hit the torpedo at all. Then came a flash of fire and light followed by the sound of a large explosion. I ended up covering my eyes so as to shield them from debris, and when I looked back there were massive chunks of flesh floating in the water where Bruce had been moments ago. Finally, after days of being hunted by the Sea Dragon and nearly being eaten by him twice, he was finally dead.

That didn't mean our troubles were over, however. There I was, floating in the open water surrounded by the bodies of close friends and family along with what was left of the beast. Tia checked on me a few times to make sure I was still alive, but it was a while before I was rested just enough to reply with noise instead of just my eyes. I have no idea how long we floated there, or at what point Tia decided to shift into her human form and pull me onto an inflatable raft. Oddly enough, by this point I felt completely rejuvenated. Even as the sun rose and set twice before other Canadian Coast Guard ships arrived to rescue any survivors, I didn't feel tired, or hungry or thirsty at all. If anything, I was both relieved that it was finally over, and mourning for the people who were lost in our fight against Bruce, with my wife and uncle-in-law among the deceased.

In fact, I didn't even notice the fact that something still wasn't quite right until we finally reached the shores of Halifax and climbed back onto dry land. I looked down with surprise upon realizing that my leg, which had been broken 48 hours prior, was now perfectly healed like nothing had happened. Even as someone like myself who's a little different, broken bones usually take 3-6 months to heal, not two days. Tia and I exchanged glances and shrugged, unsure of what to make of it. I didn't find a possible answer until my conversation with my family doctor, who looked me over a day later.

""How odd indeed,"" the doctor said as he glanced over his notes, ""Psychologically you're a mess, and yet physically you're in good health. Even with your unique physiology, the injuries you'd described as getting realistically should still be here. There is something we did find, however.""

Hesitantly, I asked, ""What did you find?""

The doctor held up a bag containing what looked like a bloodied scale as he replied, ""This is what we pulled out of your arm. We were able to identify your blood on it, but there's another source of what appears to be blood on it that matches what was found on the remains of the entity you killed. This same substance has also been found in your bloodstream. Whatever that beast was, we think that's what caused your body to recover so quickly.""

""...Is it possible to remove it?""

""Afraid not,"" he solemnly stated, ""Usually with blood transfusions there's a risk of your body rejecting the donated blood, but you're not showing any signs of that. Plus the blood has already had plenty of time to integrate into your own, so I don't think it's going anywhere. I wish it made sense as much as you probably do, but that's the situation.""

So now I'm back at home typing this out, completely unsure of how to feel about everything. I've been trying to get sleep but I keep seeing their faces whenever I close my eyes. With Ellen gone, our bed feels cold. I'm thankful that after the investigation and the funeral I was able to keep a pair of urns filled with her ashes and Dylan''s. Now they sit on my coffee table, a reminder of those that were lost but won't be forgotten. When this investigation started, I had questions about the man eater we were hunting in order to stop the attacks. Now, that monster's blood runs through my veins and almost everyone I know personally is gone, leaving me with so much trauma to process and more questions than answers.",1,1735314418.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Fast forward to earlier this year. I asked her for her number through the companies user chat, and she gave it to me. I ended up texting her, but our conversation was short-lived and didn‚Äôt lead to anything significant. However, we still chatted around the office occasionally.

A few weeks ago, we ended up at the same happy hour for one of our coworkers who was leaving the company. We chatted for about 45 minutes, discussing work and personal life. Ever since that day, I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm developing feelings for her again.

Sparks have definitely been flying, we're on the same university course and we kept seeing each other around, I always found her so pretty but just assumed she was out of my league. 

All led up to one night where we saw each other in the club and ended up kissing a whole lot, she then came back to mine and we shared my bed (we never had sex just talked for ages).

We have been talking so much since and it has been so flirty, conversation just flows and we've been enjoying it a lot. We've agreed to meet up for coffee next semester.

Only problem is I have kinda bad self esteem issues, I don't make them obvious and have a confident front, but I just can't see her being attracted to me, as she is a genuine 10/10 and I know I'm not on her level.

She's complimented me in a way that I also can't understand and would appreciate some guidance on, she has said I'm cute quite a lot, told me I have good vibes and a kind face with nice eyes, and said that I make her feel safe.

I'm hesitant between a versatile grinder (Encore Esp or DF54) or keeping my Encore and buying a K6 [250‚Ç¨]","I took advantage of Black Friday to buy a Lelit Anna, my first espresso machine :love:

For now, I‚Äôm using it with a Baratza Encore (OG, not the Esp), which quickly shows its limits: the finest grind isn‚Äôt quite fine enough, but it still makes decent espressos.

I knew this wouldn‚Äôt be a long-term solution, but I didn‚Äôt want to buy a new coffee grinder at the same time.

In addition to espressos, I regularly grind coffee for my drip coffee maker (hence the Baratza Encore).

I haven‚Äôt decided yet on which espresso grinder to go for. I see two possibilities: either I buy a dedicated grinder and end up with two grinders, or I go for a versatile one.

If I opt for a versatile grinder, I‚Äôve narrowed it down to the Baratza Encore Esp or the DF54. The latter has the advantage of flat burrs and reportedly makes better espresso grounds, but it‚Äôs more expensive (around ‚Ç¨250 compared to ‚Ç¨160 for the Encore Esp), which is the upper limit of what I want to spend.

If I go with the Encore Esp, it won‚Äôt be a significant upgrade compared to what I already have, but it will meet both my needs.

Otherwise, the other option would be to keep the Encore for drip coffee and buy a manual grinder, likely the Kingrinder K6, for espressos.

It seems to be one of the best manual models and only costs ‚Ç¨100. However, the manual aspect worries me a bit, even though I wouldn‚Äôt be making more than two espressos a day.

That K6 would be nice because its cost is very low, I could keep the Encore and it wouldn't take more space on my countertop.

I‚Äôve looked into a few locations that have great foot traffic and strong potential for success, insha‚ÄôAllah. Seattle is home to a growing community of people from various backgrounds, and I‚Äôve noticed that many people, even those who aren‚Äôt Somali, love Somali dishes and are fascinated by the richness of our culture. I believe this shop can serve as both a thriving business and a way to share our traditions and flavors with a wider audience.

Alhamdulillah, I‚Äôve also developed skills in social media and content creation, which have allowed me to reach millions of viewers with simple, engaging videos. I‚Äôm confident this can help spread the word and bring customers to the shop once it‚Äôs up and running.

If you have any advice, support, or connections that could help make this happen, I‚Äôd truly appreciate it.

Merry post Christmas to all!
I've read a lot of posts on here and just wanted to add my case. 

History of seizures/medication: 
I am m19 and had my first grand mal at 18 in April this year, I woke up at night with an aura and then passed out after about 1 minute. MRI and EEG were done there were no abnormalities and I was told it was probably a one off seizure. 2 months later I had a 2nd seizure and was then put on 500mg x2. But then 2 weeks later I had another seizure and was put on 1000mg keppra (in between auras) and a week later I had another seizure at night where I was supposed to have my inpatient EEG for 3 days. There I was diagnosed with focal TLE and was given an additional dose of 100mg Lacosamide x2.

Life situation prior seizures/ possible Reasons (from my thinking):
Vaped for 2 years 
Smoked tobacco occasionally 
Smoked weed/drank alcohol 1-2x a month 
Mixed alcohol with energetics on party‚Äôs 
Drank occasionally coffee or energy drinks
Played a lot of competitive video games/
Worked on weddings (stressful)
-> slept to little
Started 2nd semester -> more stress

My life now:
Now I have been without grand mal for about 5 months. I only had an aura twice, but this was probably due to lack of sleep or stress.
The neurologists have not yet been able to find a reason. A genetic test was suggested to me, which I am considering doing in the near future.

Side effects of Medication:
About the side effects or signs of epilepsy that I have every day:
It started with 2-4 seconds of complete lack of concentration. The pressure on my brain for up to 10 seconds + that everything (especially auditory stimuli) becomes too much for me. I also have similar symptoms before I get an aura.

I still have so many questions and no clarity sadly everything seems so individual.
If someone has some similar experiences I would be grateful to hear about it:)

Are my symptoms more likely medication side effects (when yes from which me?) or more likely from epilepsy?

Does the keppra even has a positive effect? Cause as more as I took the sooner I got a gm.

And the one I fear the most what‚Äôs the deal with a SUDEP?

At this point, this is just a little dream, I will need to work in my office job for a while to get the funding, but why not dream a bit?

Things I would do differently:  
\- Low light  
\- Either no music, or very low volume, or with a ""veto button"" at each table to turn it off if it bothers anybody  
\- If possible quiet coffee machines  
\- Individual-friendly seating with separate cabins for each seat (no back-to-back seating!)  
\- Maybe one group table  
\- A lot of plants  
\- Pets allowed  
\- Clear markings (Where to order, where the toilets are,...) No wandering around awkwardly to find stuff  
\- A lot of online options (reserve a table, order food,...)  
\- Option to have your stuff delivered to your table without any talking, if you feel like not interacting today  
\- No ""Are you fine or can I get you anything else?"" Smalltalk from staff  
\- No queues (table ordering, ticket system)  
\- Monthly talk groups for autistic people or people who suspect to be autistic  
\- Affordable prices for people with low income  
\- A lot of fidget tools to use  
\- Food and drinks customizable for the individual preferences (texture, separation, intolerances,...)  
\- Space for power naps (couches, hammocks, maybe with wake-me-up service)

All year long, we squashed the bugs you reported, polished features based on your feedback, and made improvements across the board. Sure, there are still things we couldn‚Äôt fix, but your app is now faster, smoother, and (hopefully) even more delightful to use.

# How You Shaped Welltory (and Surprised Us Along the Way)

Looking back at 2024, you didn‚Äôt just use Welltory ‚Äî you helped shape it. Your feedback, insights, and even your rants pushed us to build a better experience.

Let‚Äôs talk about some cool trends we noticed this year.

# Sleep Patterns

Breaking news: Turns out everyone sleeps less in summer and more in fall and winter. And the older you get, the less sleep you tend to get overall.

# Fitness Adoption

Sports adoption skyrocketed in 2024, led by Baby Boomers: from 40% active in 2023 to 50% in 2024!

**Workout Highlights by Generation:**

**Baby Boomers** ‚Äî born 1946-1964

Surprising hits:

* **Horseback riding** ‚Äî¬†hell hee-haw!
* **VR games** ‚Äî proving all those ""ok Boomer"" child prodigies wrong.
* **Stretching, cross-training, and bowling** ‚Äî flexing those steady gains and letting the good times roll!

Surprising drops:

* **Hockey, martial arts, and fishing** ‚Äî not as popular as in 2023.
* **Jump rope** ‚Äî fewer Boomers were jumping in 2024 (smart move!)

**Gen X** ‚Äî born 1965-1980

* Less cardio ‚Äî running, cycling, HIIT.. looks like Gen X decided they‚Äôre done chasing the treadmill dream.
* More **strength and functional training** ‚Äî lifting, squatting, and showing gravity who‚Äôs boss.
* More walking overall ‚Äî¬† proving that ""power walks"" are the best form of meditation.

**Gen Y (aka Millennials)** ‚Äî born 1981-1996

* **Pilates and stretching skyrocketed** ‚Äî up 25%. Flex now, avoid creaks later.
* **Less cardio**, but **team sports made a comeback** ‚Äî volleyball, padel, tennis, soccer, even hockey. Who knew Millennials were still down for post-work dodgeball tournaments (with way more protective gear and stretching.)

**Gen Z** ‚Äî born 1997-2012

* **Worked out less overall in 2024** ‚Äî must be busy redefining hustle culture or perfecting their ""main character"" walks.
* **Last year‚Äôs pilates and barre hype cooled off** ‚Äî the glow-up phase shifted to Gen Y.
* **Hiking stole the spotlight** ‚Äî the only activity they did more of. Nature walks: the original ‚Äúunplug and recharge‚Äù plan that even Gen Z couldn‚Äôt resist.

Gen Alpha ‚Äî born 2013‚Äì2024 ‚Äî isn‚Äôt in the stats (yet!). Looks like health tracking isn‚Äôt exactly top of mind when their biggest stressors are homework and who gets the iPad next. Give them a decade (and maybe a couple of backaches), and they‚Äôll be downloading Welltory faster than you can say ‚Äúphotoplethysmography.‚Äù

# Meditation Trends

Every January, there‚Äôs a meditation surge ‚Äî new year, new mindset, new ‚ÄúI‚Äôm totally Zen now‚Äù vibes. Then reality hits, and interest dips until November, when everyone suddenly remembers that inner peace is kinda important. 2024 was no exception.

# Looking ahead

2024 might be winding down, but we‚Äôre busy working on:

* **Daily Movement, Reimagined.** We‚Äôre working on something big here: tracking *all* your movement, not just workouts. Whether you‚Äôre washing dishes, playing with your kid, or tending to your garden, every bit of activity matters. Our goal is to help you see the full picture of your daily movement and understand if it‚Äôs enough to keep you healthy today *and* in the long run.
* **Upgraded Blood Pressure Analysis.** Say hello to a sleeker design, symptom tracking, BP profiles, and exportable reports for your doctor. And this is just the beginning.
* **HRV Analysis, Simplified and Supercharged.** An all-in-one report that‚Äôs easy to digest and packed with actionable insights for everyday users. But if you‚Äôre the type who loves geeking out, you‚Äôll have the option to dive deep into an endless rabbit hole of HRV science ‚Äî no PhD required (though it might feel like you earned one).
* **More Science Lab features that wow.** Get ready for cutting-edge features like circadian rhythm analysis to find your best sleep and workout windows ‚Äî because timing is everything.
* **New designs, greater accessibility.** Expect an app that feels as good as it looks, designed to work for *everyone.*

**Our key priorities for 2025**

We know life moves fast. Information overload, AI speeding things up, and that endless rush make finding balance feel almost impossible. But the faster life moves, the more crucial balance becomes. Time isn‚Äôt just precious ‚Äî it‚Äôs *everything*. While we can‚Äôt rewind the clock, we can help you make every second count.

In 2025, we‚Äôre doubling down on cutting-edge science to bring you tools that help you feel better effortlessly ‚Äî no matter what platform you use. Think smarter health tracking, hyper-personalized insights, and more practical advice ‚Äî all designed to fit seamlessly into your life. We‚Äôre here to help you understand your body better and make healthier choices, even when time and motivation are in short supply. And yes, there are some surprises coming your way üòâ

https://preview.redd.it/urlp3yhj589e1.jpg?width=2380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dfe0f70cb7f0e01d5f21c19be2fa1f58c4ea4a8

Your trust, feedback, and support push us to dream bigger and build better. You‚Äôre our inspiration, our motivation, and the reason we keep striving for what feels impossible.

Keep sharing your thoughts, hopes, complaints, and wildest ideas ‚Äî we‚Äôre listening and creating with you in mind.

**Here‚Äôs to 2025 ‚Äî big things are coming.**

In this video I used 9 grams of medium roasted coffee and a single wall filter basket designed for 8-11 gram doses. I try not to tamp too hard. I did a couple seconds of manual pre-infusion in hopes that it would maybe help with the extraction. The machine is set to extract approximately 30 ml when pressing the single shot button but I got a little less than 25ml. Not long after that, I tried to pull a double shot (which should be 60ml) but got just over 30ml. From what I've searched, most people suggest descaling but as I said, this machine is brand new.

# #NATURAL WRITING FOR YOUR NEWSLETTERüíå:

	‚Ä¢ Example 2: Replace ‚ÄúEngage your audience‚Äù with: ‚ÄúTry starting your article with a question like, ‚ÄòDo you feel stuck when writing?‚Äù

	`**‚Ä¢**	**Example 1: ‚ÄúWhen I started writing, I spent hours editing every sentence. Then I learned to focus on clarity first‚Äîgame changer!‚Äù**`

	`**‚Ä¢**	**Example 2: ‚ÄúA client once told me their blog wasn‚Äôt converting. We rewrote the intro to address the reader‚Äôs problem. Conversions tripled.‚Äù**`

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate a Feedback Loop**

`**Add self-check questions to ensure the content aligns with the goal.**`
	`**‚Ä¢**	**Ask:**`
	`**‚Ä¢**	**Does this sentence make sense instantly?**`
	`**‚Ä¢**	**Is this something I‚Äôd say out loud?**`
	`**‚Ä¢**	**Can I cut any fluff without losing meaning?**`

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance Engagement with Subtle Techniques**

`**Use rhetorical questions, analogies, or vivid imagery to keep readers hooked.**`

	`**‚Ä¢**	**Example 1: ‚ÄúWhat if you could write an entire blog post in half the time?‚Äù**`
	`**‚Ä¢**	**Example 2: ‚ÄúThink of writing as cooking: the fewer unnecessary ingredients, the better the dish.‚Äù**`

**7Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize for Clarity and Skimmability**

1hngte9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hngte9/aitah_for_splitting_up_with_my_girlfriend_on/,AITAH for splitting up with my girlfriend on Christmas Day?,"Context: I (M40) and my GF (39F) have been having what could be called an on-again off-again relationship for 14 months. She always says she loves me, wants a serious relationship and future, etc, and so do I, but she has a very short temper and emotional problems (to put it mildly), and her sisters warned me about this when we got together. I'm British, she's Albanian, we live in Italy, and I thought at first that perhaps it was just a matter of different cultures, but after meeting her sisters that's clearly not the case. She will always get angry about something, split up with me, then contact me again a day, a week or two later wanting to make up. The first 6 months I went along with it and actively tried to do what she wanted, because I thought in relationships there is always a matter of give and take, and sometimes people are not so good at expressing what they want and seem to think that having a tantrum is the only way to get it. But for the past 9 months or so I've been a little more forthright about saying no and calling her out on her behaviour - basically it got to the point where I felt like I was walking around on eggshells all of the time because I was scared of her reacting badly to something I said or did, but then when it got to the point where I felt like I was on edge all of the time and losing who I was, and I felt like she was always being overly critical of everything I did, I decided it was right to say something when I felt she was out of order.

She got angry I booked tickets to come back to see my family for Christmas without consulting her. (It's not a big family - no brothers or sisters, my mum has always lived alone since I was a baby, I don't have a dad, my aunt lives a couple of villages away.) There are a couple of reasons I did this - she has had a lot of problems at work recently (she's a substitute primary school teacher, and the law has changed in Italy meaning that it is much harder to find work) so I didn't want her to be forced to come if she couldn't afford it, and also partly because I didn't want to be worrying all of the time about her behaviour (she kicked off a few times last year when she was in the UK). However, I was always going to be in the UK for Christmas. Christmas with your family is very important both in the UK and in Italy. I was always clear with her that in December, when she knew what she wanted to do, she could then decide and book a flight. A few weeks ago she was going through another really tough time at work. She called me a day later and asked if she should book the same flight as me to come back for Christmas. I said yes, if she wants to, but there was no pressure if she had any problems back in Italy that she needed to resolve, which she had been talking about for most of the last week (I was trying to be supportive, and again didn't want her to feel forced into anything she didn't want to do). She took this as a massive insult, as me saying I didn't want to be with her, and we didn't talk for 2 weeks, apart from a couple of times when I tried to convince her assumption of what I meant was (as usual) not what I really meant.

My friend convinced me that we really love each other, she was just hurt, and I should invite her, so last week I did, we made big plans for things we could do in England, places we could go, and she said she couldn't wait for 2 weeks of rest, relaxing and not thinking about work. She landed Monday, I went to the station to pick her up, we went to the pub and I got her favourite food for her (onion rings and garlic bread when she's here), then we went to her favourite pub. She was tired but really, really happy.

The next day, Christmas Eve, my mum took us to a beautiful pub in the countryside with a great atmosphere and we had a couple of drinks. There was an amazing red sunset and she again seemed really, really happy and was making plans for the things she wanted to see and do over the next 2 weeks.

On Christmas Day I woke up and came downstairs at about 8 a.m. She always wakes up about 4 a.m. because she has problems with sleep, and when I came downstairs she was on the phone booking her return flight for 29th December. I asked her why and about all the things she had said she wanted to do during the previous days and why she was booking her ticket, and her response was 'You know I hadn't prebooked my return ticket and could return when I want to. I'm going to spend New Year with my mum and brother'. This was very surprising considering the big plans she had been making over the previous two days. She seemed in a bad mood all of Christmas morning, didn't seem too enthusiastic about her presents, then asked if we could go for a walk because it was warm and sunny weather. I said yes and we went for a walk around the village. While we were out I tried to ask her what was wrong.

She said that my mum had made her feel unwelcome. When my mum had got up she had turned out the light in the living room, as if she didn't even realise that my GF was there (I brought this up with my mum later, and she said it was just to open the curtains because the sun was already up), and the day before she had moved her clothes from the back room into the spare room whilst she was cooking garlic to stop them smelling, and my mum had pretty much immediately moved them back (my mum does have an annoying habit, like a lot of mums, of picking things up and moving them if she feels like they are in the wrong place, but that's just her, and there's no malice in it). She also said that my mum can't take a hint and will ask her repeatedly if she wants tea, coffee, if she's too hot, if she's too cold, etc, and she's too much (again, this is true - she doesn't have an off switch - but there's no malice in it). My mum spent the days before my GF's arrival stocking the fridge up for her (she's vegan), asking if she will like this or that, will she like this present she bought for her, etc., and doing everything she can to think about her guest, and I felt like my GF was really unappreciative, and using my mum as a punching bag for her bad mood.

We got back to the house and had to wait about 90 minutes before going to my aunt's house for Christmas dinner. I asked for advice about which Christmas jumper to wear. She told me not to wear one because it makes me look fat. My mum disagreed and told me later that she thinks she was trying to transfer the fact that her sister told her she had put on weight onto me. I asked her if she wanted a tea or coffee, she said no, I went and poured myself a glass of wine, she accused me of being selfish for not offering her one (she gets worse when she drinks and I could already see that she was in a hell of a mood, and I wasn't going to let her ruin Christmas), she said she was getting bored, then she complained in the car about how at home they raise a glass of prosecco about 10 in the morning and she felt it was a bit ignorant that we hadn't done that.

We then got to my aunt's (a very lively person who pulls out all of the stops for Christmas, very different to my mum, for whom a tree is enough), and my GF's first comment was 'Very nice. I'm staying in the wrong house. I should be staying here' (both me and my mum heard that, and I could tell that my mum had felt a bit annoyed about it later, because it came up in conversation how ungrateful my GF had sounded). My GF wasn't as enthusiastic or as involved as last year, but I was still trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. She then said something after dinner which set off alarm bells: 'Why don't you change the date of your train and flight and come back with me?' I said no, I have already got have a dozen meet-ups with friends planned over the next couple of weeks, and she knows that because we agreed to a lot of them together. My mum was talking to her as well, and I felt it was very two-faced that she was being so nice to my mum whilst at the same time telling me how much she's annoying her, and the fact that we're not making her feel welcome is why she's leaving early.

We got home about 10.30 p.m. and she went straight to bed. I went up with her to try to talk to her. She brought up my mum again, how we hadn't made her feel welcome, and started ranting a bit. By this time I was absolutely furious (I'm normally very chilled out and trying to reason everything out without resorting to anger), and what I said was something along the lines of 'My mum has done nothing apart from trying to be welcoming. We both have. We've gone out of our way to accommodate you. You're an unappreciative, ungrateful, selfish child and if everything we have and do here is so wrong then you're welcome to find somewhere else to stay'. (She looked surprised and started cursing at me in Albanian) 'You're an awful person. I've told you about this kind of behaviour before and how it's not acceptable, and I always give you a second chance, but you always push me to breaking point until I can't take any more. No wonder your sisters say that you have behavioural issues' (By this point she's throwing bedding at me in a fury)

I went downstairs, told my mum I'd told my GF she could leave, explained all my GF's problems with her and me, she packed her bag and told me to call a taxi for her, and that she had booked a hotel in the city centre. I tried to defuse the situation and apologise for losing my temper, told her that she could stay and I would sleep on the sofa until 29th December, but told her that she had to understand why I had reacted like that after she had done her best to ruin Christmas for us despite being a guest, and that she had said hurtful things to me and insulted my family. My mum tried to reason with her as well. She went outside to wait for her taxi. I was genuinely worried for her and asked her to come back in, and told her that there would always be a bed here for her if she changed her mind (her response in Italian was 'Go f\*\*k yourself'). I've since found out from a message that she sent to my mum (who sent her one first to ask if she was okay) that she has changed her flight to today and is flying back.

I think it's safe to say that this time we definitely won't be getting back together. The only two things which I said which I think were wrong were bringing her sisters into it (that was too personal and below the belt, and I recognised that the second I said it, but by this time everything I was thinking was spilling out), and that if she didn't like it she could find somewhere else to stay (again, not what you want to hear when you're a foreign guest in a strange land), but should I have held my tongue and at least waited a couple of weeks, or is it right that I didn't let her spend the next 2 weeks ruining one of the few periods of free time I get off work?

Can somebody give me some insight?,"I don‚Äôt know if this is the right sub or if I should crosspost this somewhere. I‚Äôve got a friend on the spectrum who I get along with really well, one of those friends you mesh with and goof around all the time. My mum‚Äôs got Asperger‚Äôs and talked to me a lot about things she had problems with while I was growing up, I think that‚Äôs why we get along so well.

Normally I wouldn‚Äôt have a doubt in my mind she‚Äôs interested in me, but I have to emphasise that she is very much on the spectrum. I don‚Äôt mean this as an insult, but she can be quite childish with how she expresses her emotions and shows affection at times. She‚Äôs also just a regular person in most ways, our mutual friends think she‚Äôs a bit unpredictable, but she just seems very spergy. If you take all this in to account, you‚Äôll understand why I‚Äôm confused.

Anyway, she‚Äôs my housemate‚Äôs partner‚Äôs best friend, she brings her over to hang out sometimes. We didn‚Äôt spend any time together outside of a group setting until recently when my workout partner moved overseas and I was going alone for a while. My friend just swapped from leg and core workouts to a full body strength routine, so she invited me to come with another one of her friends. After a week or so, she said I didn‚Äôt respond fast enough in the group chat and asked for my number. She started texting me to come to the gym, but stopped bringing her friend. We started hanging out outside of the gym, grabbing coffee and stuff. My housemate‚Äôs partner who I met her through said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYou two are hanging out a lot, hey? ü§®‚Äù another one of my friends asked a bunch of questions about her and my sister asked if we were dating.

I didn‚Äôt think anything of some of the things she does until they said that, I started noticing things that I‚Äôd normally think meant a woman is interested in me, but it just doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like that‚Äôs what it means this time, if you get me? To give a few off the top of my head, before we‚Äôd hang out, she‚Äôd be the most happy to see me in a group and want to chat with me the whole time, when she comes to stand next to me, she stands so our shoulders are touching, I went to bed early at my housemates birthday party a couple of weeks back, she was drunk, came into my room and woke me up, but it was so she could talk and play games on my computer, a few times she‚Äôs leant over with her tits in my face at the gym, another time we were at the beach and she was showing tattoos all over her body to me, but she also autistic info dumped for an hour about them and today the reason I posted this is because she tried to spoon feed me some fancy honey she put in my tea (best honey I've ever had) and looked upset when I took the spoon instead. There‚Äôs a few more, but that‚Äôs enough to give the gist of it.

I guess I‚Äôm confused because she‚Äôs obviously going to behave differently than most women, but it feels patronising to think she‚Äôs just naive and doesn‚Äôt know how some things come across. To be fair, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it until my sister started asking questions.

Deep down I know what's right to do but still expressing it to reddit strangers might actually be helpful:

For the past year, I have been super close with my female bestfriend let's say. Her status: She lives abroad, sort of hate the country but pays better than here. She lives with her 9ish  year boyfriend who loves living abroad and has a nice job etc etc.  She is there for the last two years which might actually be a part why she  communicates way more with me. And by way more, I mean, we can go from 23:00 -> 03:00 talking online voice chatting etc. 

  
She is now in home-country for holidays. We have been out for coffee, movies and we plan to go for beers tomorrow. She is playful but nothing too flirty. She sometimes throws  some stff like ""what to do with my life, I hate living there"" etc, but I can't be the one who push    for a decision, and I don't want to make a move on someone who is in a  probably happy relationship.

  
I, as you can guess, have developed  very strong feelings. Especially those late night talks were we ""tease"" each other feel very warm to me. I know, I'm not delusional. Means nothing. I'm also seeing someone (nothing serious), but whenever I'm out with her, or another  date, I just come back and wanna go chat with my ""bestie"".

  
To me, I can do one of the following:

1) Slowly phase out, like being little more distant? 

2) Express how I feel about her, with her replying that she feels nothing which will trigger some kind of self-respect mechanism and make me cool with the whole situation.

Am I missing something? 



Hope I don't get hate :)

Let's face it, bad breath can be a real romance killer. It‚Äôs that awkward, silent elephant in the room that can turn a potentially magical moment into a cringe-worthy experience. We've all been there, whether it's our own breath we're worried about or someone else's. This comprehensive guide delves into the complex world of kissing and bad breath, exploring the causes, the cures, and the social etiquette surrounding this sensitive topic. We'll unravel the science behind bad breath, offering practical advice for maintaining a fresh, kissable mouth. From quick fixes to long-term solutions, we'll cover everything you need to know to keep your breath minty fresh and your kisses unforgettable.

The Science Behind Bad Breath (Halitosis)
-----------------------------------------

Before we dive into solutions, let's understand the enemy. Bad breath, clinically known as halitosis, isn't just about that morning coffee or last night's garlic bread. It's a complex issue stemming from various factors. Think of your mouth as a bustling metropolis ‚Äì a thriving ecosystem of bacteria, both good and bad. When this balance gets thrown off, things can get, well, stinky.

### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) ‚Äì The Culprits

The primary culprits behind bad breath are volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These smelly sulfur compounds are produced by bacteria that feast on food particles trapped between your teeth, on your tongue, and in the crevices of your mouth. Imagine these VOCs as tiny, invisible stink bombs going off in your mouth. Yuck!

### Common Causes of Halitosis:

Bad breath isn‚Äôt just about what you eat. There's a whole host of contributing factors, including:

- **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Skipping brushing and flossing allows food particles to linger, creating a bacterial buffet.
- **Dry Mouth (Xerostomia):** Saliva acts as a natural mouthwash, rinsing away debris. A dry mouth creates a breeding ground for bacteria.
- **Certain Foods:** Garlic, onions, and spicy foods are notorious breath offenders.
- **Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions, like diabetes and acid reflux, can contribute to bad breath.
- **Smoking and Tobacco Use:** Tobacco products dry out the mouth and leave behind a lingering, unpleasant odor.
- **Medications:** Some medications can cause dry mouth, indirectly leading to bad breath.

Kissing and Bad Breath: A Delicate Dance
----------------------------------------

Alright, let‚Äôs get to the heart of the matter: kissing and bad breath. Picture this: you‚Äôre leaning in, the moment is perfect, and then‚Ä¶ BAM! A wave of stale breath hits you like a wall. Talk about a mood killer. This delicate dance of intimacy can be easily disrupted by something as simple as bad breath. It‚Äôs not just uncomfortable; it can be downright mortifying.

### The Social Etiquette of Bad Breath

Dealing with someone else‚Äôs bad breath can be tricky. You don‚Äôt want to hurt their feelings, but you also don't want to suffer in silence. Here are a few tips for navigating this delicate situation:

1. **Be Subtle:** Offer a mint or gum. This is a gentle, indirect way to address the issue.
2. **Honesty is Sometimes the Best Policy:** If you're close to the person, consider having a private, compassionate conversation. Phrase it constructively, focusing on concern rather than criticism.
3. **Lead by Example:** Maintain excellent oral hygiene yourself. This sets a positive standard and might encourage others to do the same.

Kissing and Bad Breath: Conquering the Stink
--------------------------------------------

So, how do you keep your breath fresh and kiss-ready? Here‚Äôs a breakdown of strategies, from quick fixes to long-term solutions.

### Quick Fixes for Fresh Breath:

- **Sugar-Free Gum or Mints:** These stimulate saliva production, which helps wash away odor-causing bacteria. Opt for sugar-free versions to avoid feeding the bacteria.
- **Mouthwash:** A quick rinse with mouthwash can temporarily mask bad breath. Look for antiseptic mouthwashes that kill bacteria.
- **Drink Water:** Swishing water around your mouth can dislodge food particles and help dilute VOCs.

### Long-Term Solutions for Lasting Freshness:

- **Brush and Floss Religiously:** This is the cornerstone of good oral hygiene. Brush twice a day for two minutes each time, and floss daily to remove trapped food particles. Think of it as spring cleaning for your mouth!
- **Tongue Scraping:** That fuzzy coating on your tongue? It's a haven for bacteria. A tongue scraper can effectively remove this coating, banishing a significant source of bad breath.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps keep your mouth moist and washes away debris.
- **Regular Dental Checkups:** Visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and checkups. They can identify and address any underlying dental issues that might be contributing to bad breath. Think of it as routine maintenance for your pearly whites.
- **Diet and Lifestyle Changes:** Limit sugary drinks and foods, quit smoking, and manage any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to bad breath.

Kissing and Bad Breath: Beyond the Basics
-----------------------------------------

Now that we‚Äôve covered the essentials, let's delve into some more nuanced aspects of this topic.

### Bad Breath and Self-Esteem

Bad breath can be a significant blow to self-confidence. Feeling self-conscious about your breath can make you withdraw from social situations, affecting your relationships and overall well-being. Addressing the root cause of your bad breath can have a profound impact on your self-esteem, allowing you to interact with confidence.

### The Psychology of Kissing and Bad Breath

Kissing is an intimate act of connection. Bad breath can create a barrier, disrupting this intimacy and creating feelings of awkwardness and discomfort. It's not just about the physical sensation; it's about the emotional connection, or lack thereof, that bad breath can cause.

### The Future of Fresh Breath

What does the future hold for fighting bad breath? Research is constantly evolving, exploring new technologies and treatments. From probiotic mouthwashes to innovative breath-analyzing devices, the quest for lasting freshness continues.

Addressing Specific Concerns:
-----------------------------

- **""Morning Breath"":** We all wake up with less-than-perfect breath. This is due to decreased saliva flow during sleep. Brushing and flossing before bed and upon waking can help combat morning breath.
- **""Keto Breath"":** The ketogenic diet, while effective for weight loss for some, can sometimes lead to a distinct, fruity-smelling breath due to the production of ketones. Staying hydrated and maintaining good oral hygiene can help mitigate this.
- **Braces and Bad Breath:** Braces can trap food particles, making it more challenging to maintain oral hygiene. Diligent brushing and flossing, along with the use of interdental brushes, are crucial for keeping breath fresh while wearing braces.

# Army of Losers

**Chapter 1: In the Dog Cages**

It was 5 a.m. Wednesday when slave 73-B woke up in its small dog cage. It was a tiny, cramped, steel cage that offered no comfort whatsoever, and slave 73-B was forced to sleep naked like an animal with no blankets or pillows ‚Äì or it tried to sleep, anyway.

Its cage was surrounded on all sides by dozens of other naked male slaves who had been locked in metal dog cages for the night. They were all imprisoned in the dark, dingy basement of Master Max‚Äôs enormous mansion.¬†

A loud, unpleasant alarm had gone off, and the pitch-dark room was suddenly flooded with painfully bright floodlights. All of the dog cages automatically unlocked, releasing the cucks. It was bright and early, time for another long hard day of slave labor, and as always the losers had nothing to look forward to but unending toil on behalf of their Master.¬†

Slave 73-B was naked except for a shock collar around its neck and a surprisingly small metal chastity device that was locked onto its puny little cock. The tight cock cage was lined with painful, needle-like spikes. It was permanently locked, of course, and naturally Master Max had the only key. He collected them ‚Äì Max had sole ownership of countless cucks‚Äô chastity keys.¬†

Slave 73-B had originally been named Mike, but he was no longer allowed to use that name. Mike had been a scrawny little nerd who liked fantasy novels like the Lord of the Rings as well as comic books and geeky rock bands like Rush. Mike also liked to relax and smoke a little weed. Mike had been born into wealth ‚Äì millions.

His Wife, Stephanie, was a shapely Brunette who had obviously married Mike solely for his money. Everyone knew it. Even Mike knew it, but he didn‚Äôt care because She was so incredibly hot. Stephanie even manipulated him into not asking for a prenup.

Even after the ceremony, She refused to sleep with him, only allowing the little geek to go down on Her at length after She made him get down on his knees and beg for it. In any case, Stephanie had all of Mike‚Äôs money and the marriage seemed to be going well until Stephanie met Max. After that, everything was different.

Today, slave 73-B dragged its aching body out of its metal cage. It wouldn‚Äôt need a shower this morning because its body had been hosed down by ice-cold water from a pressure washer last night. It groggily tried to remember what its duties were going to be today. Some of the slaves worked two jobs to earn money for Max. Other slaves worked one job and also toiled around the estate when they weren‚Äôt at their paying jobs. Some of the cucks were full-time maids on Max‚Äôs estate, while other slaves worked long shifts seven days a week in one of Max‚Äôs factories or in his agricultural fields. Some of the slaves were field slaves, and others were house slaves. The house slaves were all defeated cucks whose Wives lived in luxury with Max.

Slave 73-B remembered that it was on maid duty today, so it began putting on its sissy maid outfit, which was an itchy uncomfortable polyester uniform that included a frilly skirt, an apron, stockings and high heels. There was even a little maid‚Äôs hat. This was as humiliating as always for the poor defeated male.¬†

Next it was time to grab a mask and put it on. All of the cucks on Master Max‚Äôs estate were nothing but nameless, faceless workers forever, unimportant in any way. Besides their feminine uniforms, the cucks all wore featureless black leather masks that covered their faces, erasing their identities. Each mask had a slave name stenciled onto its forehead ‚Äì names like MAGGOT, SCUM, FILTH, WEAKLING and WORTHLESS. Each cuck was randomly assigned a different name each day. Slave 73-B was handed a mask with the name DOGSHIT stenciled onto its forehead. So that would be the cuck‚Äôs name today ‚Äì slave dogshit.¬†

The cuck put on its mask. It was slave dogshit now.

It was time to go to work.

‚Äî-----------------------------------------

**Chapter 2: Waking in Paradise**

Meanwhile, hours later, Master Max woke in a comfortable king-sized bed in the lushly appointed Master Bedroom of his mansion with five beautiful women in bed with Him, gently kissing His big muscular body all over.¬†

These were only five of Max‚Äôs many women. Stephanie was lovingly kissing Him on the lips and the neck and softly telling him over and over how great He was. Melissa and Jessica were planting sweet, sweet kisses up and down the left and right sides of His powerful frame. Meanwhile, Natalie had her lips around Max‚Äôs impressively huge cock while Ashley sucked on His balls.

Stephanie, Melissa, Jessica, Natalie and Ashley were all wearing incredibly sexy lingerie in an attempt to please Max. Grabbing Max‚Äôs attention was practically a competitive sport in this household full of hot women. Each woman was more gorgeous than the last. At this point, all of their loser husbands were totally forgotten and were trapped forever in abject slavery to Max. What losers! The five beautiful Women playfully rubbed their soft, lingerie-clad Female bodies all over Max. This felt great, as always. It was good to be Max, as always. The five women kept kissing Max and worshipping him and telling him how wonderful he was.

‚ÄúOh Baby, You‚Äôre the Greatest,‚Äù Stephanie breathily told Him as She continued planting gentle Female kisses on Him. ‚ÄúMax, We all love You so much, Max, We worship You.‚Äù

As always, Max took His sweet time getting up. The maids had already been working for hours, but Max would never have to work a day in his life because he had so many defeated cucks working their asses off for him. All of their earnings were direct-deposited into Max‚Äôs account, and justifiably so. Max deserved the money more than they did.

Max stretched His big muscular body like a cat, then reached out and grabbed a little bell on His nightstand. He rang it once. Immediately a cuck maid who had been stationed outside in the hallway for hours rushed into the room. The well-trained thing stood at strict attention before Max, with its arms straight down by its sides and its eyes on the floor at all times. Its black leather mask had the name NOTHING stenciled onto its forehead. Max took His sweet time acknowledging slave nothing‚Äôs pathetic existence. He was savoring Natalie‚Äôs lips on his cock under the covers, so He totally ignored slave nothing for 10 minutes while slave nothing continued standing silently at attention with its eyes to the floor.¬†

Slave nothing regarded its Master with a mix of fear, awe, hatred, admiration and envy. For starters, Max was 20 years younger and more than a foot taller than slave nothing, infinitely more muscular and powerful than slave nothing, smarter than slave nothing, more handsome than slave nothing, and more decisive than slave nothing. Slave nothing recognized that Max was better and more important than slave nothing ‚Äì it seemed obvious ‚Äì but that didn‚Äôt mean he had to like it.

*That cocky young son of a bitch*, slave nothing thought silently to itself as it continued standing at rigid attention.

""And we'll do whatever else is needed, hmm? After all, people should help one another. Life is a long, twisting road, Ida. No one should have to walk it without support from friends.""

Glancing down at the little watch hanging from her brooch, Rebecca stood and gathered her umbrella and purse.

""Look at the time! I have to go check on Mrs. Peller. She's due any day. Thank you for the coffee, Ida.""

Ida walked her guest to the door, smiling.

Things would be all right. She was certain of it.

(28F) (33M),"I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (33M) for about 5 months, and recently, I‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed by his constant talking and his disregard for my need for space.

One issue is how much he talks. It feels like he's always chatting about the same things over and over. For example, he rants about his dad, complaining about how terrible he is, but continues to stay in touch with him despite all of the issues. I‚Äôve told him he needs to either accept his dad or stop talking to him, but it feels like he just vents without making a decision.

He also criticizes me for having ‚Äútoo much energy‚Äù or for asking ‚Äútoo many questions,‚Äù but then when he drinks coffee, he turns into a non-stop talker, bombarding me with questions and conversation. This morning, I tried to get some quiet time by closing my eyes and asked for space, but he ignored it and kept talking. Later, he texted me saying, ""Sorry if I was annoying this morning, just got a random burst of energy. Here‚Äôs to a good day,"" but it didn‚Äôt feel like an apology‚Äîmore like a brush-off.

What frustrates me the most is the inconsistency. He‚Äôll complain about how other people are too talkative, but he‚Äôll talk at length without me even saying much. He also gets irritated when I ask simple questions, like about the weather, telling me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Google,‚Äù but happily chats about other things endlessly.

I‚Äôm starting to feel like my need for peace and quiet isn‚Äôt respected, and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm overreacting. Part of me feels like this relationship is draining me, but I struggle with breakups. It‚Äôs hard to walk away even though I‚Äôm not feeling happy. I‚Äôm unsure if I should keep trying to talk through these issues or if it's time to end things.

**My question is:** How can I bring up my need for quiet and set boundaries around his constant talking, while also deciding whether this relationship is worth continuing?

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend (33M) talks nonstop, repeats topics, and ignores my need for quiet. He also criticizes me for things like having too much energy or asking questions, but then does the same things himself.

EAT CLEAN no sugar no soda no candy avoid heavy carbs like pasta and bread unless your doing a healthy bulk


2. SLEEP get 8 hour per night! Or try..mute that phone turn that tv down settle in earlier

3. WORKOUT I do pushups and sit-ups and free weight squats‚Ä¶there is many variants of these so do some research. I have a stationary cycle and KOVE having my iPad playing during my workouts. Just like calisthenic workouts during commercials on television. I have a bench, some dumbbells, a heavy bag and an exercise ball. Why pay $1200 a year at the gym (besides the sauna and pool and meeting people!)

4. MAKE A PLAN you can journal and hit certain muscle groups throughout the week. Committing is important but draw up a plan and it will slowly become more gratifying as you complete days weeks months‚Ä¶you can make a check box next to your daily exercises or write new goals or exercises you learned! So much journaling has to offer!

More Tips:
I want to add I love leaving out my gym clothes down to my sneakers and socks so it‚Äôs coffee into a workout most mornings..

Don‚Äôt stress! If you are dreading it the night before don‚Äôt be worried to take a day off or move days around!
You will notice a change or at least people will in you in six weeks if you eat sleep and workout 4-5 days a week (3 for the beginner)but don‚Äôt get discouraged when it takes a bit longer after six weeks to see new changes it‚Äôs a lifestyle your adopting it will happen.
Go for walks and jogs!

Don‚Äôt buy junk food at grocery store. If it‚Äôs not in the house you are not eating it..you‚Äôre putting in work by making that decision.

Don‚Äôt weight yourself constantly if you‚Äôre putting in the work‚Ä¶again it‚Äôs a lifestyle change it doesn‚Äôt happen over night. We have much to learn with our weekly routines.

Sad to say it but don‚Äôt cheat‚Ä¶I see so many people doing irreversible damage to their bodies by not knowing how to do steroids because they‚Äôre not getting them from their doctor usually men over 40 need them only stay away from them they will destroy your testosterone and hormones and really hurt you in the long run. Also, these new natty steroids called swarms stay the hell away from them. Young men please dont follow these silly influencers who are gonna be destroyed by 35 all for clicks and to sell a product.

Practice meditation learning fitness and stretching!

Please add for the new comer this year to a healthier life! You got this whether it‚Äôs losing weight getting bigger biceps a six pack. It all takes a lot of time and a lot of changes with your sleep eating habits and routine.

If you don‚Äôt know how to cook simply learn here‚Äôs one buy a crockpot go to the seasoning aisle buy meat by what‚Äôs on the back of the seasoning packet the vegetables and toss them in a $50 crockpot set for four hours and boom! I like eggs scrambled or hard boiled in morning!

Figure out what exactly you want like I said earlier, whether you wanna be in a calorie deficit or a calorie surplus‚Ä¶don‚Äôt waste your workout by over eating! You want to be in a caloric deficit but not starving yourself certainly never do that.

At the moment Im more into the Philips barista brew machine because of - the design, the better look at all and the accessories which will match my kitchen.

\- If there is anyone with the Philips barista brew - is it worth it? Is it working all right? 

\- Will I get tired of taking a few minutes to make my coffee each morning instead of clicking a single button? ( in other words - should I look for an automatic machine? )

2. SLEEP get 8 hour per night! Or try..mute that phone turn that tv down settle in earlier

3. WORKOUT I do pushups and sit-ups and free weight squats‚Ä¶there is many variants of these so do some research. I have a stationary cycle and KOVE having my iPad playing during my workouts. Just like calisthenic workouts during commercials on television. I have a bench, some dumbbells, a heavy bag and an exercise ball. Why pay $1200 a year at the gym (besides the sauna and pool and meeting people!)

4. MAKE A PLAN you can journal and hit certain muscle groups throughout the week. Committing is important but draw up a plan and it will slowly become more gratifying as you complete days weeks months‚Ä¶you can make a check box next to your daily exercises or write new goals or exercises you learned! So much journaling has to offer!

More Tips:
I want to add I love leaving out my gym clothes down to my sneakers and socks so it‚Äôs coffee into a workout most mornings..

Don‚Äôt stress! If you are dreading it the night before don‚Äôt be worried to take a day off or move days around!
You will notice a change or at least people will in you in six weeks if you eat sleep and workout 4-5 days a week (3 for the beginner)but don‚Äôt get discouraged when it takes a bit longer after six weeks to see new changes it‚Äôs a lifestyle your adopting it will happen.
Go for walks and jogs!

Don‚Äôt buy junk food at grocery store. If it‚Äôs not in the house you are not eating it..you‚Äôre putting in work by making that decision.

Don‚Äôt weight yourself constantly if you‚Äôre putting in the work‚Ä¶again it‚Äôs a lifestyle change it doesn‚Äôt happen over night. We have much to learn with our weekly routines.

Sad to say it but don‚Äôt cheat‚Ä¶I see so many people doing irreversible damage to their bodies by not knowing how to do steroids because they‚Äôre not getting them from their doctor usually men over 40 need them only stay away from them they will destroy your testosterone and hormones and really hurt you in the long run. Also, these new natty steroids called swarms stay the hell away from them. Young men please dont follow these silly influencers who are gonna be destroyed by 35 all for clicks and to sell a product.

Practice meditation learning fitness and stretching!

Please add for the new comer this year to a healthier life! You got this whether it‚Äôs losing weight getting bigger biceps a six pack. It all takes a lot of time and a lot of changes with your sleep eating habits and routine.

If you don‚Äôt know how to cook simply learn here‚Äôs one buy a crockpot go to the seasoning aisle buy meat by what‚Äôs on the back of the seasoning packet the vegetables and toss them in a $50 crockpot set for four hours and boom! I like eggs scrambled or hard boiled in morning!

Figure out what exactly you want like I said earlier, whether you wanna be in a calorie deficit or a calorie surplus‚Ä¶don‚Äôt waste your workout by over eating! You want to be in a caloric deficit but not starving yourself certainly never do that.

Community please add some tips and tricks for the newcomer and even the advanced thank you and have a great 2025!

Today I forgot I was making coffee halfway through and didn‚Äôt remember till an hour later. A few months ago I accidentally poured water into the coffee grinder instead of the kettle. I‚Äôve tried to put the kettle back in the fridge instead of the milk multiple times. I instantly forget so many things I‚Äôm planning on doing, eg the other day i said to my partner I was going to take photos of the paint we‚Äôre using to make sure I got the right one from the shop, then on the way to the room the paint was in I forgot about it and left for the shop without taking photos.

It drives my partner mad - every time I do the cleaning I forget bits and forget to put the cleaning stuff away. I set timers for everything I need to do even in 5 minutes time so I don‚Äôt forget - and if I forget to set a timer I forget to do the thing 100% of the time.

My husband, son and I are going on a cruise on one of the smaller ships, out of San Juan for spring break. I forget the name of the suites but we booked a one bedroom, which includes access to the lounge. 

We did a similar cruise last year at New Year and really appreciated the breakfast in the am, coffee and happy hour. 

We were discussing the cruise with my parents, and my mom was interested. We have a lot of airline points so we told her we‚Äôd pay for her flight so that was the encouragement she needed. She just asked me to book her room. She just wanted a balcony but I saw the junior suite was actually slightly cheaper. This should‚Äôve been my first clue. It looked like it included all suite amenities. (I thought it was cheaper due to worse location on ship. There were like 2 balcony rooms and 2 junior suites left.) She asked me if it included the lounge and I said yes. I didn‚Äôt realize until after that the lounge is for gold suites and above, which would be the next level up from my Mom‚Äôs room. Of course there are none of that room type available. 

Sorry for the long explanation but the tl/dr is there a way to pay to add this or anything? I know she‚Äôd enjoy a nice coffee in the am. 

My parents rarely travel because my dad doesn‚Äôt like to. He was nervous booking a cruise for her without a travel agent, which I scoffed at (we are regular travelers, including cruises and I am typically great at booking things). I understand it‚Äôs a first world problem but hopefully it‚Äôs understandable because we are trying to make sure the trips she takes are perfect. ",1,1735309284.0,royalcaribbean,16,0.6,False

I miss you so damn much. But anytime I try to be gentle or kind to you, you are so cruel to me. Even when I am stoic, you are cruel. You hate me and I don't know why. Why do you get to hate me when you did all of this and I still don't hate you? 

Everyone keeps saying I miss the you I thought you were. That I don't miss YOU because you aren't the person I loved. I know they are right but it is damn hard to seperate the two most days. 

I have some good days. Sometimes I can see hope for my future. But I still can't imagine finding anyone as handsome as you. Anyone who I have so much in common with as you. 

I still think about every little thing I do and how I used to do it with you by my side. I made coffee this morning. We always made jokes about how strong we loved our coffee and how no one made it as good as when we made it at home. What's your coffee like now? 

Why would someone throw away all of this? To have a person who knew you like the back of their hand and loved you, all of you. I can't understand it. It's all I wanted. You as a partner for my whole life. You were my best friend. Your absence is so loud. 

I catch myself looking at photos of us. From our sons birthday. Our trip to the pumpkin patch. I was so happy. And I scrutinize your face trying to see how i didn't know. 

You told me yesterday you had no feelings at all towards me. I can't wait for the day I feel the same. I can't wait for this stupid fucking delusional feeling that we can somehow make our way back after this to go away. We can't. We could never. This is final. And yet part of me wants to hang on to the idea that you do love me and this was all a mistake and you are somewhere thinking the same thing but are too guilty to ever admit it. But I know you're not. It's insane how seperate the brain and heart can function. And what your mind will do to protect you. 

I imagine myself signing divorce papers in a few months. And I cry the whole time. Because I don't want a divorce. I want to be married to you. But you have given me no choice. You have made sure there's no way back this time. It's so out of my control I feel desperate at times. Like I'm reaching for a hand to pull me up but there is nothing there at all. 

My self worth is annihilated. I think of all the innocent moments I was myself in front of you. Goofy, dorky, clumsy, bad with directions, breaking things in the kitchen trying to bake something new, letting my gas tank get too low, not folding my clothes well. Things you laughed at as me being ""type b"" at the time, but I imagine in your head you despised me all along. 

I know it will all get better. One day the love I feel will disappear. Right now everyday hurts like hell. I hate being in this house. I can't wait to move. Every inch of it has us in it. I especially hate our bedroom window looking out over the garden we planted together in spring. Dead now. A mess now. Seems symbolic.
