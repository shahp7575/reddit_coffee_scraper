1j5gz32,https://i.redd.it/dm4bryn6m7ne1.png,Tried these shitty flavors yet?,I tried the 3 new flavors [iced frappe too] of Nescafe cold coffee drinks as they were relatively cheaper than BT and Sleepy but all of them taste like shit. They were already doing great with their tera pack cold coffees like Hazelnut was the best. What do you think about these?,1,1741328006.0,delhi,0,1.0,False
1j5gydl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1j5gydl/my_uncle_speaks_to_me_more_after_passing/,My Uncle speaks to me & more after passing.,"5 months ago, on Oct 14, 2024, my Uncle passed away. he was always one of my favorite persons, and we were close. I'd also like to add that I've had many, many ghost experiences throughout my life - and my mother and I have been called ""mediums"", we have that click with the spiritual world or whatever, and this isn't the first time I've heard a family member after they passed, but sorry let me get to it... So my Uncle passes, and then later in the middle of the night.. I could feel his presence - as well as hear, like, creaking noises. All of a sudden, I hear him whisper something at my doorway, CLEAR AS DAY his voice!! but i didn't make out what he said, so I began asking - to no avail. I called my mother to share what just happened.. she was sleeping at her sister's where this Uncle of mine had also lived, and my Ma began smelling coffee. middle of the night, the smell of coffee brewing. that was also my uncle, I believe. if he didn't have a beer in his hand, it was coffee in the morning, hah.

The next day, I was sitting on my bed before abruptly smelling him. This lasted 20 minutes more or less. He had a very paticular smell in his ending days, from the toxins or whatever leaving his body due to cirrhosis of the liver. I continued having experiences, like seeing orbs or figures. And to this day, I still feel his presence sometimes. Lately he's been messing with my mother's stuff, between her owl statues being turned, and one of her photographs placed on the ground from sitting on the shelf!",1,1741327933.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

1j5gq8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1j5gq8x/do_most_people_spent_the_majority_of_their_time/,Do most people spent the majority of their time alone?," Even though I live with my family and have a couple friends, I spend probably 50-75% of my time alone. I have a 4.0 major gpa, and as a result I am constantly hurdled in my room studying alone. When I am not studying, I am at school, which although I am technically surrounded by people its a lecture so its not exactly any different than being alone. then I commute a half hour (1 hour when combined both ways) to school 4 days a week. When I think of it I probably spend about 12ish hours alone on a school day and probably around 5ish hours alone on days that I either go to work or have the day off from both work or school. I'm wondering, is this how most people spend their days each day? here is a very simplified sample of what I typically do in a day

general daily routine school day  
7am get up and get ready  
8:10 drive to school  
9-anywhere from 11am-4PM get out of school  
5-6 gym  
6:30-9ish study  
9-10 wind down routine, go to sleep at 10

general daily routing day off  
8am get up, drink coffee, eat, and get ready  
9am go to gym  
10:30 get back and shower  
11 typically will watch youtube or just do some other fun thing to pass time  
2ish hang out wiith several friends often on the weekends   
6ish get back home do other random things to pass the time or get bored and start studying for next week school  
10pm sleep

1j5gnof,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Maleficent-Ease-1398/comments/1j5gnof/a_cup_of_joe/,A cup of joe,"It’s the small moments that matter, like grains of sand becoming a pristine beach.

Or in my case, a dismantled building.

For example, months ago I asked him to just make the coffee the night before so when I wake at 530 with our youngest, it will already be done and I don’t have to shuffle a grumpy toddler with the beans, water, and glass carafe. I reminded him for a few weeks then eased off, because if I have to remind him to make the coffee, I might as well do it myself.

It turned into him waking up early and rushing to get it done after I had gotten youngest.

Then turned into him waking, saying sorry after he saw I already made coffee, then getting on with his day.

But what would really help is if I didn’t have to remind him to get me a gift, to plan a date, to *want* to spend time with his family.

Or maybe even just making the coffee. ",1,1741326800.0,u_Maleficent-Ease-1398,0,1.0,False
1j5gm59,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5gm59,ristorante giueme (Tabelog Bronze 4.19) Omagari February 2025,"Have been looking forward to sharing this place, a little gem tucked away in the middle of nowhere is ristorante giueme. Owned and operated by Chef Sasaki and his wife, the restaurant provides an unforgettable experience. It was also a bargain for the lunch, with the food cost only being ¥7600 including tax. The entire course lasted under two hours but I stayed a bit longer just chatting with the owners 

Getting to the restaurant required a day trip from Morioka, after getting off the shinkansen to Omagari station I had a lot of spare time before lunch so took a nice long walk to the restaurant. Taking a bus is possible but infrequent so the best option would be taking a Taxi. There is virtually no buildings nearby just open space and the road. Walking in you see a cozy little dining room with a few tables. They have blankets and fire heaters setup and they asked if I had a time limit incase I had to catch a train, it felt very inviting. Unfortunately with the snow disrupting the train line there were a few cancellations so it was just me and another local party. The Chef’s wife was very welcoming and loved to chat about the region, the vendors/farmers they source from and best of all shared some of the food adventures she and her husband have been on in recent years. My table was full of brochures and booklets of farms, producers and regional specialities. I was however glued to a copy of the 2024 Gault and Millau Japan food guide, she handed me a copy after learning about my food trip and gave me lots of recommendations throughout the country she and her husband loved. Chef Sasaki only popped by to say hello after dessert and we had a nice chat about my trip and restaurants I’ve been. He tried to guess the places I’m going to next based on city and also chimed in on the places he thought were worth visiting. 

It isn’t just the very friendly service they offer, each dish was delectable. The focus on sourcing of ingredients is vital to the couple and it really showed in the final product. Pretty much everything was sourced within 20 minutes from the restaurant, the vegetables and flour being organically produced. Freshly made bread and pasta left me wanting more but the first dish really blew me away. After dessert they had me try a range of different coffee beans sourced from across the world, sitting there watching the snow fall was just paradise. 

Needless to say I will definitely make the journey again, hopefully sooner rather than later. It is definitely not a place many tourists will visit but if you’re ever in the area I wholeheartedly recommend a visit. ",4,1741326633.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

1j5gilq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5gilq,I need help from this community!,"Hi, darkroom experts. I’m an artist trying to merge the processes of relief printmaking and chemigrams, but I have very little experience in photo development. 
The process is simple; I create an image on my gelatin printing plate with oil-based ink and print directly onto Ilford photo paper. The ink acts as a resist during development like any other chemigraph. The problem I’m having is the amount of time it takes to develop; any more than one minute and my ink starts to degrade and I lose detail/definition in the image. I am using homemade caffenol, which seems to work fine, but is there a way to increase the strength to accomplish faster development? Ideally, I would like to have a flash developer that fully develops in less than a minute. Would heating the developer have any effect? Increase or decrease in sodium bicarbonate, coffee or vitamin C? 
I have professional developer on its way, but I would love to be able to improve my caffenol recipe for my specific needs, if only for the sake of accessibility.

Victoria Housekeeping Co. (Maid Corp) Interactions with Warhammer 40k Factions

Imperium of Man
Adeptus Terra:
The High Lords of Terra are aware of the Maid Corp's existence but maintain a hands-off policy due to the organization's ancient Dark Age origins and self-imposed neutrality. The Maid Corp's ability to provide actual food and lost agricultural goods makes them quietly tolerated, especially since they willingly set up Maid Cafés within the Imperium that subtly recruit while providing excellent hospitality.

Adeptus Mechanicus:
The Tech-Priests view Maid Corp with a mix of awe and hatred. Their Dark Age of Technology megastructures, gene-modding techniques, and self-repairing weaponry represent technological mastery that the Mechanicus considers both heretical and sacred. However, the Maid Corp's refusal to share their secrets, combined with the fact that their technology works flawlessly without the need for the Omnissiah's blessings, makes the Mechanicus seethe with jealousy.

Adeptus Astartes:
The Space Marines respect the Maid Corp's martial prowess and speed but view them with suspicion due to their unorthodox tactics, lack of religious devotion, and refusal to submit to the Emperor's authority. The Maid Corp's tendency to greet them in full Maid Core aesthetic often leaves the more serious Chapters completely baffled.

Astra Militarum:
Most Guard regiments have no idea how to process the Maid Corp. Their Ogryns, who possess beyond-human intelligence thanks to gene-modding, often leave Imperial officers feeling deeply inadequate. Longshanks units operating alongside Guardsmen have been known to outperform entire platoons. However, the fresh food supplied by the Maid Cafés makes them beloved by the rank-and-file troops, who consider the Maid Cafés a mythical oasis of comfort in the grim darkness of the far future.

Inquisition:
The Inquisition is deeply divided on the Maid Corp. The Ordo Xenos, Ordo Hereticus, and Ordo Malleus all have conflicting opinions. Some Inquisitors see them as a necessary evil, others as a dangerous rogue state that needs to be purged. However, any purging attempts are mysteriously thwarted by 'accidents' and 'unexpected ceasefires'—often while an Inquisitor is mid-sip in one of their Maid Cafés.

Officio Assassinorum:
The Assassin Temples know better than to target Maid Corp operatives. Reports suggest that Haru personally dispatched three Vindicare Assassins sent after him with only a tray and a teacup.

---
Chaos
Chaos Space Marines:
The Traitor Legions find Maid Corp baffling. The sheer absurdity of facing genetically enhanced maids wielding P90s and Kar98ks while dodging tea trays at bullet speed often sends even hardened Chaos Marines into existential crises. Despite this, they view Maid Corp's neutrality as a potential opportunity and have attempted to sway them to the Ruinous Powers — all attempts have been politely declined with a complimentary cup of tea.

Daemons of Chaos:
The Maid Corp's shields, infused with Dark Age technology, are fully capable of repelling daemonic incursions. Rumors abound of entire daemonic hosts being politely escorted out of Maid Cafés by Longshanks staff with nary a scratch on the furniture.

---
Xenos
Eldar (Craftworlds):
The Craftworld Eldar maintain a distant but cordial relationship with Maid Corp. They view them as an anomaly of the past best left undisturbed. The Victoria Housekeeping Co. has been known to provide rare teas and snacks to Eldar diplomats in neutral meetings.

Dark Eldar:
The Drukhari are utterly terrified of the Maid Corp. There are whispered rumors of entire raiding parties disappearing after targeting Maid Corp planets, only for their personal effects to turn up neatly folded and laundered in Commorragh's markets weeks later.

Orks:
Orks refer to the Maid Corp as the ""Cleaning Ladiez."" They are one of the few factions capable of inducing genuine fear in Orks due to their ridiculous speed, overwhelming firepower, and refusal to acknowledge Orkish logic.

Necrons:
The Necrons view the Maid Corp as a highly advanced anomaly and potential threat. However, certain Tomb Worlds have been convinced to maintain peaceful relations after receiving the finest tea service in 60 million years.

Tau Empire:
The Tau see the Maid Corp as a possible ally in their quest for the Greater Good, though the Maid Corp remains firmly neutral. However, the Tau have developed a fondness for their Cat Cafés and frequently send diplomats for 'diplomatic discussions' that last suspiciously long.

---
Miscellaneous
Rogue Traders:
Rogue Traders often seek out Maid Corp worlds for resupply and information, paying handsomely for access to their agricultural goods and luxury services. The Maid Corp maintains a mutually beneficial relationship with several dynasties.

Genestealer Cults:
Maid Corp worlds are functionally immune to Genestealer infiltration due to hyper-intelligent Ogryns who can detect even the faintest genetic abnormalities during routine housekeeping checks.

The Black Library:
The Black Library has several accounts of the Maid Corp's exploits, though the Harlequins refuse to speak on the subject — possibly out of second-hand embarrassment.

---
Known Worlds of the Maid Corp
- Victoria's Cradle: Alderson Disk homeworld, a superstructure of unimaginable scale and technological marvel.
- Cafe Éclair: Agri-world producing coffee, cocoa, and pastries from Old Terra.
- Chaton Haven: Agri-world specializing in livestock for Cat Cafés, including the breeding of various feline species.
- Haru's Folly: Former death world converted into a tropical vacation resort with luxury Maid Cafés.
- Polaris Prime: Industrial world producing Maid Core weaponry.

---
Despite their whimsical aesthetic, the Victoria Housekeeping Co. is one of the most bullshit organizations in the galaxy. Their combination of Dark Age technology, gene-modded personnel, and absolute neutrality ensures that they remain an enigma. Entire wars have been paused when Maid Cafés appeared on battlefields — their immaculate service providing a brief respite from the endless carnage.

No one knows the true extent of the Maid Corp's power or how many worlds they control.

But everyone knows the tea is perfect.

1j5g97y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1j5g97y/the_nightly_adventures_of_steves_brain/,The Nightly Adventures of Steve’s Brain,"# The Nightly Adventures of Steve’s Brain

Steve had a long day, one of those where his feet ached, his eyes felt like sandpaper, and his brain felt like it had run a marathon inside his skull. He barely had the energy to change into his pajamas before collapsing into bed, and the moment his head hit the pillow, he was out like a light. That was when his brain, which never slept, took care of the little things. Well, the big things really. Anyway, Steve's brain was taking his nightly bath. He had a shower cap on and was humming a tune while he was scrubbing away. It always reminded him of when he was tiny. His mother would always ask, ""Did you get under the cerebellum?"" and he would always reply, ""Yes, Mom.""

After Steve's brain was done bathing, he went to work. Work was always the same—strengthen some memories, thin some memories, sort some memories, erase some embarrassing ones from middle school. It could have gotten boring, but Steve's brain had plenty of dreams to watch while he worked. They were like soap operas to him. Steve had the greatest dreams—wild, unpredictable, and often more entertaining than anything Hollywood could come up with. One night, he could be an intergalactic smuggler outrunning space cops, and the next, he could be a detective solving crimes in a world made entirely of cheese. His subconscious held no limits, and that was just the way his brain liked it.

Tonight, Steve's brain selected a dream at random from the archives. It started normally enough—Steve was back in high school, only he realized he wasn’t wearing any pants. Classic. But instead of the usual panic, Steve's brain decided to shake things up. Suddenly, the high school transformed into a spaceship, and Steve was the captain, wearing an elaborate admiral's uniform (still no pants, but now it was stylish). His crew? A collection of sentient tacos, a talking raccoon wearing aviator sunglasses, and a three-eyed librarian who communicated entirely in Morse code.

""Captain! The dream is destabilizing!"" shouted a taco with a mustache. ""We’re losing structural integrity!""

""What?"" Steve asked, adjusting his imaginary glasses (because, of course, his dream self wore glasses for dramatic effect). ""What’s causing it?""

""Looks like a rogue memory is interfering with the plot,"" the raccoon grumbled. ""Steve's brain must have forgotten to file something properly. Typical.""

Steve’s brain, still wearing his shower cap, groaned from his control center. ""Darn it. I knew I should have done the deep memory clean-up earlier. Hold on, I’ll fix it.""

With a few quick rewires and a mental wrench, the rogue memory was isolated. Unfortunately, that memory was the one time Steve had accidentally called his second-grade teacher ""Mom."" It had somehow taken the form of a towering, fire-breathing Mrs. Thompson, who was now attacking the spaceship with a giant ruler.

""Steve! Are you even paying attention?"" she bellowed, slamming the ruler against the ship’s hull. ""I expect full sentences in your writing assignments!""

""Full power to the engines!"" Steve shouted, suddenly in full action-hero mode. ""We have to escape the memory collapse!""

""Captain, the engines are fueled by imagination! We need more nonsense!"" the raccoon advised. ""Quick, think of something absurd!""

Steve concentrated. He needed to come up with something ridiculous to keep the dream running. Immediately, a disco ball descended from the spaceship’s ceiling, the walls melted into candy canes, and suddenly, every crew member was on roller skates, spinning in zero gravity while funky music played. Mrs. Thompson, momentarily distracted, forgot why she was angry and started grading imaginary essays in the air. The ship surged forward, free from the collapsing memory.

Back in the control center, Steve’s brain wiped his metaphorical forehead. ""That was close. I need a vacation.""

Too late for that. The dream was shifting again. Steve was now in the middle of a detective noir story. He wore a long trench coat, and it was always raining. The neon lights of the city flickered as he walked down the street. Steve’s subconscious narrator kicked in.

""It was a night like any other. Rain fell like pennies from a cheapskate’s pocket. I had a case to solve, and no clues—except for the tiny ferret in a bow tie waiting for me outside my office.""

Steve bent down. ""You got something for me, pal?""

The ferret, speaking in an overly dramatic Brooklyn accent, handed Steve a tiny briefcase. ""Inside here is the truth, but once you open it, you might not like what you see.""

Steve’s brain, now sipping an imaginary cup of coffee in his control center, sighed. ""Alright, let’s see where this goes.""

Steve opened the briefcase, and instead of evidence, out popped a memory from five years ago—specifically, the time he had tripped while carrying a birthday cake and fallen face-first into the frosting. The dream immediately transitioned into a courtroom where Steve was on trial for ""Cake Crimes.""

""Your Honor, I plead—"" Steve started.

""Guilty!"" bellowed the judge, who happened to be his childhood teddy bear. ""Sentenced to a lifetime of eating slightly stale cookies.""

""This is outrageous!"" Steve shouted, but it was no use. The jury, consisting entirely of sock puppets, nodded in agreement.

Steve’s brain sighed again. ""You know what? Let’s just end this one early.""

With a flick of a mental switch, the dream melted away. Steve’s brain exhaled deeply and looked at the clock. ""Alright, almost morning. Time to wrap this up and boot up the wake-up sequence.""

Suddenly, a red alarm blared.

""Uh-oh."" Steve’s brain looked at the control panel. A massive warning sign flashed: *You forgot where you put your car keys yesterday.*

""Crap, I need to retrieve that memory before Steve wakes up, or he's going to spend half the morning searching the house.""

Frantically, Steve’s brain scoured the archives, swimming through old grocery lists, passwords he never wrote down, and that one really good idea for a book he forgot to write down. Finally, buried beneath a stack of song lyrics from the 90s, he found it.

""There they are! Under the couch! Why does he keep putting them there?"" Steve’s brain shook his head. ""Alright, let’s make sure he remembers when he wakes up.""

The wake-up sequence began. The world brightened, and all the crazy, nonsensical dreams started dissolving. Steve's brain sighed, taking off his shower cap and hanging it up for the next night.

Morning arrived. Steve woke up, stretched, and rubbed his eyes. He felt oddly well-rested, as if a lot had happened, though he couldn’t quite remember what.

Then, without thinking, he walked to the couch, reached underneath, and pulled out his car keys.

""Huh,"" he muttered, before heading off to start his day.

Back inside, Steve’s brain smiled, put his feet up, and prepared for another long day of keeping Steve functioning and another night of dreams.",1,1741325256.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

We were totally vibing. The banter you guys, was phenomenal. Like I’d known her for a longggg time. Next thing you know, it’s 2AM and they’re closing the bar, she invites me back to her place, and we talk, laugh, kiss, then make love until the sun comes up. Like the conversation with this woman was down right intoxicating. We basically would’ve kept talking if we both didn’t work the next day. So we fall asleep for a few hours, then I give her a lil hug/nuzzle kiss in the morning then head home to get ready for work. 

I grabbed her number earlier that night, and so we started texting a bit the next day. I had accidentally left my beanie at her place, so we agreed we could meet up for coffee sometime and chat some more. The texting slows down, then she stops responding. Or when she does respond, it’s like every 5 or 6 hours. Which had me loosing my mind. But after a few days, she apologized because she’d been sick, and would let me know when she’d be up for meeting up. I said ok, and then I asked if she liked soup…. Idk if this was a good move, but she said yeah and I offered to bring her some. She said she didn’t want to get me sick but appreciated the offer. The next day, I had the dumb idea to drop by unannounced and bring her some soup anyways. I texted her that I had some soup for her and I was going to be there soon to drop it off, but she told me she wouldn’t be home grab it, and on top of that she didn’t appreciate not giving her a heads up about coming over randomly. Which I totally get having we just met each other. She wasn’t super mad or anything, but just wanted me to give her a heads up next time.

But now I feel like I just made things awkward by being kind of pushy maybe and acting needy doing a lil gesture like that. Idk maybe I’m overthinking things here because I’m worried I f’d things up. Especially because we haven’t texted at all since that whole thing went down. 

Honestly after writing out this whole thing, I feel like I have been overreacting and I just need to calm down lol. But also would love some advice on how to proceed!

Much obliged!

Every time I thought I had my workflow locked in, something changed. What worked for me one year was useless the next. Some days I had deep focus. Some days I could barely get anything done. And instead of fighting it, I started adjusting.

And honestly? That’s the only reason I’ve lasted this long.

I’ve done some ridiculous things in the name of getting things done:

Worked in my car, on the floor, standing up—anywhere that might trick my brain into focusing.

Lived off cold pizza and coffee just to avoid stopping.

Set completely fake deadlines just to force myself to move faster.

Ignored texts, skipped plans, stayed up way too late chasing an idea—only to wake up and change half of it.

Was all of it smart? No. Did it work? Yeah. Because productivity isn’t about sticking to a perfect schedule. It’s about figuring out what works today.

And that’s where the real game-changer is: the cyclical feedback loop.

The way I see it, productivity isn’t just about doing the work—it’s about constantly learning from the process:

Gratitude – Recognizing the progress I made, no matter how small. If I ignore the wins, I burn out.

Humility – Accepting that I didn’t do everything perfectly and there’s always room to improve.

Reflection – Looking back at what worked, what didn’t, and why. No emotion, just learning.

Adaptation – Taking what I learned and adjusting for the next day, the next project, the next challenge.
Then the cycle repeats. Over and over. That’s how I’ve stayed productive—not by following the same routine every day, but by constantly feeding back into this loop.

Some people keep long streaks of consistency by following the same routine every day. That’s great. But for me? My only real consistency has been staying adaptable.

Because the second you stop learning from your own process, you stop moving forward.",6,1741324390.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

If I'm stuck between two Dommes and unsure whom to send money to, I would, 100 times out of 100, go for the one who manifests rather than the one who doesn’t!

Honestly, I manifest a couple of times per day myself. If I have enough time and energy. 

I would manifest all day if I had the stamina, but after 2-3 times, you just don’t feel like manifesting anymore.

People should stop shaming Dommes for manifesting, IMO. Do you think it’s easy to manifest every single day, multiple times?!! Show some respect!

**That said, it’s important to use the word** ***manifesting*** **properly, in accordance with correct English grammar, as advised by Webster’s Dictionary committee.**

As a highly educated manifestor myself who also deeply cares about English grammar, I see it as my duty to educate my fellow manifestors on the correct use of the word.

Here are a few examples for reference. 

Please note that manifesting is used **incorrectly** in one of these sentences. Can you spot which one?

If you answer correctly, you will receive a **certificate** authorizing you to keep manifesting for the next 10 years:

1. OMG, I got a stomachache. I knew I shouldn’t have **manifested** all those hotdogs last night! 
2. Look at those jawlines, I could **manifest** him up right here, right now. 
3. No, ma’am! You’re not in a position to **manifest** on ME! I **manifest** on YOU! 
4. I shouldn’t have **manifested** in my bed until noon. 
5. My boss **manifested** into my inbox with ""just a quick task,"" and now my whole day is ruined. 
6. My teenage cousin **manifested** my phone, and now my screen time is 98% 18+ content. 
7. The WiFi stopped working, so I had to **manifest** outside and touch grass. 
8. I **manifested** to the fridge for the fifth time in ten minutes!
9. I **manifested** my ankle on the coffee table, and I might do it again.
10. This boy ""*accidentally""* **manifested** his entire ice cream onto my pants. 

**I hope you found this little quiz informative and were able to guess the correct answer.**

Now, I’ve had way too many pizzas over the last couple of days, and it’s caused me some manifestive problems.

1j5frox,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1j5frox/the_island_hopper_operations_chaos_a_flight_review/,The island hopper operations chaos - a flight review,"**TLDR:** We recently took the United Island hopper from Honolulu to Guam. We were expecting some issues, since the route is complex. What we not expected were 2 cancellations, a lot of stress, and that none of our plans worked out. Given all the circumstances, most people we met were fantastic! 

**Introduction**  
The United Island hopper had been on our bucket list for years - my friend and I, both avgeeks, have decided to fly the route on our winter break since we had found a cheap ticket from Germany to HNL and back from TYO (GUM would also have been possible) for 1050 EUR with JAL. 

We planned to stop in MAJ for 1 night and PNI for two nights - this didn’t work out as planned, and it stressed us out more than we could enjoy the flights. However, many of the United staff and especially the locals were amazing! None of our „big“ plans worked out, but we still had a good time. 

Please fasten your seatbelts for a detailed review of our United Island Hopper flight. We’ll also try to give some overview on what we did on the islands and where we stayed.

**2 Bookings made it even more complicated**

Since United has a monopoly on the Island hopper, they charge hefty prices - miles is the way to go. Therefore, we used our Lufthansa and United miles.

One booking was done thru Lufthansa (35k for the first person and 17.5k companion award for the second) from HNL-MAJ in business class. If United releases space, you could book the entire hopper for 20k LH miles in eco, but stopovers are not permitted.

For the rest of the route, we used our UA miles. The route MAJ-PNI was 15k miles per person in Y, the route. PNI-ROR (via GUM) was another 15K in Y (GUM would have been as expensive). For ROR-TYO (technically not part of the island hopper), we paid 22k miles via GUM and Osaka, with an airport change there. 

Our planned itinerary:

\* 26 Feb: HNL-MAJ 

\* 1 night in MAJ 

\* 28 Feb: MAJ-KWA-TKK-PNI

\* 2 nights in PNI

\* 02 Mar PNI-TKK-GUM-ROR

\* 1 night in ROR

\* 04 Mar: ROR-GUM-KIX / short city tour / ITM-HND



**A bad start**

Our flight to Majuro got delayed the day before departure. This was due to crew rest time. Since we weren’t aware of the procedure, we called the 1K hotline and asked, what the bag drop cutoff time was - after looking it up, the agent told us „60 minutes“ of the new departure time - that wasn’t right. It’s 90 mins for all the island hopper stations. Luckily, our bag was small, so we only had to throw out some liquids. Still annoying. One of the friendly HNL airport agents told us that phone agents do not know the procedures and the special route, because „they don’t work at the airport“. He was right, and we saw that several times during our trip. Little did we know that this incident was the least of our entire journey. 



**Inches do matter**

When it comes to size, it seems to matter - at least when it comes to the recline. The island hopper is a special flight: The cabin crew changes mid flight. A Technician is on board, seated in row 7, so minor mechanical issues can be fixed right away. There are two cockpit crews on the flight. One is flying, the other one resting in row one. The seats on the left side recline more than a regular first class seat and are electronically adjustable. Row.2 left, therefore, is blocked, and is used as a storage for the crew. 

And that’s where the mess began - we boarded, and tech ops was still on board. The reason: Seat 1C was not fully reclining - and the FO told them it is a FAA requirement. We were in the prime seats 1D and F. The engineers worked really hard. They eventually seem to have fixed it, but we were told to deplane.

I was asking the ground crew whether we would fly out today - they were honest and said it didn’t look well. They were right: we were informed the flight was now departing the next day at 9 am. It was pushed away for inspection. 

We went to the club, which had fantastic staff - and Dole Whip. There, the agent tried to get us rebooked. The problem: our rescue flight UA3011 would have arrived in MAJ after UA154, the onward flight we would have taken - and the regular UA154 that day was already sold out. The lounge agents could not reissue the ticket all the way to PNI.

We therefore called the 1K hotline - they immediately got our problem and solved it amazingly: they booked us all the way to PNI on the rescue flight and cancelled the MAJ-PNI portion on the second booking. All set, even though we were sad we would not make it to Majuro. We were hoping to at least get a passport stamp there the next day.

We had to stay a night in HNL and UAL has done a great job organizing that: A 20 USD food voucher was automatically issued after the flight was first delayed to 4pm the same day (before being cancelled completely). The lounge agents issued another 2 20 USD vouchers per person, and gave us 2 separate hotel rooms in a good hotel. 

To our surprise, we received an email from customer care - they offered me (1K) either about 50k miles or a 925 USD ETC for the cancellation - my friend, who is a silver member, received a 650 USD ETC. 

While we were disappointed about the cancellation, United definitely made it right! Especially the 1K hotline and the ground crew in HNL. Time to explore the island!



**Exploring Hawai’i**

We have to admit, there are much worse places to be stuck than Hawai’i! After everything has been sorted out with United, we rented a car with Budget and enjoyed a ride across Oahu. We visited the Dole plantation, Pearl Harbour and stopped along the way to get lunch. They would not accept our food vouchers. 

United sent us to the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach. We could choose between 3 places, and this was one marked as a „premium option“. A great hotel, with all amenities we needed, close to the beach. All things included in the „resort fee“ (we didn’t have to pay) were included, such as bottled water and beach towels. What better thing to end our day than with a sunset swim at Waikiki beach while watching aircrafts land. 

For dinner we went to the Paia fish market and had snapper - they accepted our vouchers (basically a virtual credit card). 2 fish were about 60 USD. 

Even though we didn’t get to MAJ that day, we made the best out of it - and enjoyed Hawaii. Nothing to complain about. 

**A fantastic first flight - are we on a good way?**

The next day, we were supposed to leave on the UA3011 rescue flight, which basically replaced our yesterday’s cancelled flight. ETD 9.00 am, and UA154 should leave around 7.30-ish. They had a crew issue, and instead of sending us out first, they waited until UA154 eventually left HNL. We departed shortly after at 11:40 (2:40 hrs late), which would result in another operation chaos. I don’t know who decided not to send us out first, but probably someone not aware of the complex ops of the island hopper route did not foresee what would happen. 

The flight was fantastic, and we really thought we were on a good way. The purser Shenetta and her whole crew provided outstanding service. I believe they specifically request being on the island hopper, and you definitely notice that they love their job. 

Shenetta was really proud that UA finally started loading the HNL-based cocktails previously only available on Hawaii-Mainland US routes on the Island hopper. No way we could deny her offer to try a Mai Tai! 

We preordered a croque monsieur for our original flight, and of course it wasn’t there, but the other choices we had (we tried both the sweet and the savory breakfast) were great.

We didn’t have to wait for drinks to be refilled, and Shenetta even brought us drinks and snacks „for later“. We suspected this was since they would run out of specific items early on that route, as we had read in other flight reviews, but it turned out Shenetta had saved us from dehydration during our MAJ layover. 

After crossing the international date line, we landed in Majuro and were given the option to deboard. UA154 was also on ground. 



**Confusion in MAJ**

That’s where the first chaos began - all pax of the UA154 flight as well as our flight were cramped in the small departure hall. The temperature felt like 40 degrees, and the AC was working hard, but with that many people, couldn’t keep up keeping the hall cool. 

We decided to stand outside in the shade and talk to some other 1K customers. The locals seemed to be very relaxed about the situation, since they’re used to disruptions on that route. We had a great time, and were really happy that we still had a can of drink from the previous leg. I think there was a shop inside. United didn’t provide us any water, even though the ground time was about 3 hrs, and the heat was unbearable.

We tried to get a passport stamp to at least get a proof of our short visit, but were turned away by several station agents. One went to ask the immigration officers, but it seems they had stopped stamping for quite a while. At least we could take some pictures. 

While waiting, rumors spread that the flight would skip Pohnpei today. We got zero info, and wifi was not available (a network was showing, but too many people were logged in). After a while, they confirmed we should just re-board and see where we would end up. 

We got back on board, and prepared to take off. Uncertain where we would end up, we were greeted by the new crew.

**The crew and class have changed**

  
We sat back in Eco, they put us in row 12 with a free middle seat. For some reasons, both of our bookings got split, but that was no issue. 

After a cabin crew member went to check for seatbelts, when we thought she was done with her checks, we kindly asked her for a cup since we didn’t drink for about 2 hrs. She berated us like we were first graders: „AFTER I AM DONE WITH MY IMPORTANT SAFETY DUTIES“. We get that, but it’s the way she talked to us. At least she got us the cup. 

She went on with that tone and attitude throughout the entire flight, also towards other passengers. Maybe she had a bad and stressful day. The other crew members, including the purser, were the complete opposite, very welcoming and friendly towards everyone. We asked one whether we could switch seats, and she said that due to KWA being a base, we would have to remain seated as stated on the manifest, but could switch later on. Friendly, with a short explanation, that’s how it should be. The flight to KWA was uneventful, but we got drinks and felt welcome, still in the dark where we would end up today. 



**Chaos evolves**

Next stop was Kwajalein, a US base, where only pax ending their journey there got to get off. Taking photos and videos wasn’t allowed. 

The safety process differed from what the rule should be. While refueling, they didn’t announce to be unbuckled. This seems to be in order with FAA rules, and surprising to us as Europeans, but as long as the airplane doors are open, it seems fine. Changing it could save lives, since when evacuating, every second counts. 

What concerned us: At every stop, pax staying on board had to identify their bags. While this worked well in TKK, in KWA, they didn’t take the process seriously. Some guys went through, sometimes carrying around bags like they were offered in an auction. Half way through the aisle, they stopped. We were never asked to identify our bags and still took off. „Safety is our top priority“? We didn’t feel safe that time.

On top of that, they wanted to show everyone their assigned seat. They asked pax to come back to the end of the aircraft. This was impossible, since they started to decide to board the aircraft at the same time. At some point, they stopped with the procedure and just let us sit where we used to sit. Very chaotic, and definitely not an organized ground experience. 

**Final destination - Chuuk**

We flew to Chuuk. PNI, where we intended to go, was skipped. This is due to some lights at the runway malfunctioning, making the landing in the dark impossible.

A very avoidable delay, if they sent us out earlier. The ETA in KWA was 13:56, and we arrived at 18:27, in the dark. Thanks to not sending us out before UA154 despite having a ready crew, and delaying the departure in MAJ, we could not make it to PNI - another day, another cancellation.

The next destination was Chuuk. We flew directly above PNI and could only see the island passing. 

In TKK, we were first asked to remain on board. After a while, all pax with the destination PNI were asked to deplane. We were not giving the choice to head to the transit area. All bags were offloaded and we had to stay on the island.

**Baggage Issues**

When the bags were offloaded, another bad surprise waited - mine was open and some items were missing. Another inconvenience, at least they opened a file right away.

For the local pax from MAJ, another surprise waited: no bags were loaded - despite being on ground for nearly 3 hours. So we were glad our stuff arrived. 

**Stuck on Chuuk**

What to do now? Our stay in PNI was kinda useless now, since we wanted to go to Nan Madol, and given the fact that the aircrafts in rotation were out of sync, we thought it would be the best to go straight to GUM the next day.

UA154 got cancelled and never left Chuuk. They put in a rescue flight all the way to GUM, so we tried to get on that one. But how, without internet?

Luckily, a friendly station agent shared wifi so I could call the 1K desk, where I talked to Beverley. She immediately got what happened and rebooked us to GUM the next - it didn’t take more than 10 mins, including her getting the ok from her supervisor, since the two bookings were still split. 

The station team even checked us in and handed us the boarding pass to GUM. 

They also organized us a hotel - we were asked whether sharing a room would be fine, since space on the island is limited, which we agreed on - we eventually got two rooms, which we were never expecting. 

We didn’t get anything real to eat except some almonds on the KWA-TKK flight. It was about 19.30 local time, and the last meal we had was the one on the HNL-MAJ flight. No more restaurants were open, including the one in the hotel United had put us in. Despite being 2 mins walking distance directly across the terminal, the station agent took us in her car. She even took 3 of us to a local shop to get some Ramen bowls so we wouldn't have to starve until the morning. 

The hotel was called L5 (level 5) and was probably the best one on the island. Modern standards, friendly staff, and the rooms were spacious and clean (I was greeted by a dead cockroach in the bathroom, but that is normal on the islands). One of my towels was dirty, however. 

That’s where United is shining: you don’t get up stranded in the middle of nowhere, even on a small island which isn’t prepared for that many stranded passengers.

The hotel even had quick wifi - faster than mine at home. Turns out they use Starlink, and it really works well.

**A nightly surprise**

The bed was a bit shaky, one foot was swinging, so I was afraid the bed would collapse and I woke up in the middle of the night. I checked the UA app and noticed - the flight to GUM was taken out of our reservations. WTF

I immediately called the 1K hotline (it was about 3 am local). The agent didn’t understand what happened. I had to explain her for about half an hour. The problem: the system showed we had flown to PNI, since the coupon was showing „used“. TKK never showed up, even though United dropped us there. 

After insisting her to check the flight nr manually, she finally got that we were in TKK. And then proceeded to ask that our only way to get to GUM would be to pay 300 USD.  „That is the only way“. 

After insisting that we never wandered to end up in TKK, she talked to a supervisor and then said she could get us to PNI the same day. „Then we’re out of it“, as if we were a piece of trash. She clearly did not want to deal with it, and sounded pissed throughout the entire call. 

At least she booked us to PNI, so we wouldn’t end up on TKK. 

I also adressed my safety concerns of the ground process in KWA and asked where I could report them. She said „that’s not our issue“. Wow, safety really seems to be „our top priority“. It’s a FAA report, in that case.

After talking to her for a good 1.5 hrs, including several times being put on hold, I asked for her name. She then muted me on purpose. The entire call, there were background noises. She just muted me. That really confirmed that I was a piece of trash for her and she didn’t care at all about us as passengers. 1.5 hrs - in the middle of the night. Even worse, if I didn’t check the app, we would have ended on the island for another 2 days. First cancelling the flight without notifying us and then being so rude on the phone is not what I would expect after 2 flight cancellations. 





**An Island tour**

The breakfast the next morning (UA provided 2x 20 USD food vouchers for the hotel restaurant) tasted amazing - fresh tuna. 

Checkin opened early, and since the hotel was across from the airport, we could drop the bags right away and had some time before boarding. 

We hailed a taxi to get an impression of the island. Prices on Chuuk are regulated and are 1 USD per stop and passenger, taxis are shared. We ended up paying the driver 20 USD for a tour of an hour, which was a good deal. He took us to the seaside, the harbor, a shop and the blue lagoon. Our time was limited, but we really enjoyed the ride. 

**Instant upgrade**   
Due to the rebooking in Y class, I could get a Premier Instand Upgrade since it was a domestic flight. Definitely needed, since the weather on Chuuk was really warm and sunny, so I had about 4 soft drinks which the friendly crew happily provided to get hydrated. 



**Landed in Pohnpei**

Our plan was to still get back on the flight to GUM that day, which would arrive about 3-4 hrs after our landing. Enough time to get it sorted, one would guess.

But no: The airport office told us they had already closed the flight list and couldn’t put us on. Not even on standby (the departure to GUM was in under 24 hrs so that would have been an option). They denied performing a LMC (last minute change) to the loadsheet. They even called Chicago, which also refused opening the flight again to put us on. The TKK station told them we voluntarily changed the destination back from GUM to PNI, which wasn’t true. 

There was no other choice than to spend a night in PNI. Afraid of not getting to Palau in time, we rode to the hotel. A friendly passenger took us there, and even gave us a tour across the city. 

**An awesome island**

Pohnpei is known for its pepper - but it’s very difficult to get it anywhere on the island, not even the two largest supermarkets have it in stock. We were told a ship arrives every 6 weeks to bring fresh fruit and vegetables in - in between, access to fresh fruit is very limited. 

We stayed at the Cliff Rainbow hotel, where we originally planned to stay for two nights. While the reservation was gone, we had to pay about 2-2.5 times the price for a room that night. The hotel also had starlink and quick wifi. The room was basic, but clean. The power outlets were not fixed to the wall, so charging devices was quite eventful. The view - amazing.

We later went to the Mangrove Bay hotel’s bar (taxi is about 2-3 USD per pax each way, hotel and restaurant staff are happy to call one). We met amazing locals there, who even got us drinks (e.g. a fresh coconut). It’s really easy to connect with others there. Pohnpei is known for having one of the best tuna on earth, and even Japanese are known to travel there for the sashimi. We had amazing food. 

One sentence that is still stuck in our head - we did the island hopper as a fun trip on miles. Others rely on it as the only way out. United charges hefty for that, and if something goes wrong, there’s nothing the people can do. A local told us, he always laughs when he hears „thank you for choosing United“ - while a choice is basically non-existent on some of the stops along the way. 

For breakfast, I had a Japanese style bento box with tuna and sashimi and it tasted amazing. Even though we stayed in Japan for a couple of nights after our island hopping tour, this was one of the best meals I had on the trip, if not the best. 

To at least see something, we climb Sokeh’s ridge - next to the rock, which you can see during the approach. The hotel organized a taxi which waited for us during our hike. Some Japanese WWII relicts are up there, and the view is stunning. So much to explore. Our time was limited, but we need to come back.

The island and its people really impressed us. We need to get back, not only to visit Nan Madol and have some Sashimi but also to finally get some pepper as a souvenir. 

**Papers, please!** 

When we checked in, next surprise waited for us - while I was fine, my friend traveled on an ESTA. We were requested to show it on paper - that never happened to us. Usually airlines can check if pax are „okay to board“ when an ESTA is on file. PNI station could not. Even on the DHS website it says that a printout isn’t required, and airlines have a way to call in in case the system fails. 

But how to prove we have a valid ESTA? We were sent to a store a few mins away, but it was closed on Sunday - after asking in the United station office, they let us use their computer to look up and print the ESTA record. 

Turns out the arrival hall had functioning wifi (port authority). We were son relieved when the flight finally took of from MAJ - a yet unknown technical issue needed to be fixed. When we asked the station crew whether the plane had left MAJ, they said yes, even though it had not - that’s not the kind of pax communication I would expect. 

**Moana**

On the next flight, which only took about an hr, we could watch the entire Moana 2 movie - why? Because we waited 1 hr on ground to get started. It turns out the problem was the communication system of the aircraft didn’t work properly (ADS-B). The location data needed to be transferred by phone. That’s why we took off late. The crew was nice and provided almonds on request - it was the same crew that brought us to PNI yesterday, which was a pleasant surprise. 

**Starlink and ground crew - both quick**  
In Chuuk, the fantastic ground crew turned around the plane very quickly. We were allowed to get off and there was a group of divers who shared their starlink wifi to the entire group of pax on the flight. Amazing how much traffic such a small device can handle! 

We caught up about 15 mins of the delay thanks to the professional ground process. 

**The Finale** 

We got to GUM about an hr late - with enough layover time to get to ROR. On the TKK-GUM portion, sandwiches were offered. The crew of the connecting flight to ROR was outstanding. Such an amazing service. The food (a sandwich) was inedible, but they did everything to made us feel welcome. We slept 90% of the flight, but when we were awake, we were offered drinks, got taken care off, and that was a great way to finish our trip across the pacific. 

**A pristine paradise**

Technically not part of the island hopper is the island of Palau. They charge a 100 USD entry fee levied with the ticket, unlike PNI where you need to pay 25/pax when leaving the country to the authorities at the airport. 

Is that fee worth it even for a short stay? Yes! Such a beautiful island, with so much natural beauty. It really is a „pristine paradise“.

We rented a car and drove around the island. The Ngardmau waterfall was beautiful and a nice hike in the shade, the old Japanese lighthouse far up north offered amazing views, the monoliths were impressive and Kuabes Park is a nice and hidden beach park to hang out and have a picknick. We drove further east and saw the parliament. In the evening, we saw the rock islands and went to a German pub „Kraemers“ which great food.

We stayed in the Palau Hotel. A modern hotel with a young vibe and many amenities. Breakfast was Asian and they had beach towels available. They also offer free coffee and juice. We could stay there the evening before our flight time at 3 am, still enjoying the amenities. They offer free parking. 

Palau was our favorite place, and we need to come back! 

**A cold shock**

Back in Japan, after two uneventful flights with great service, we landed in KIX, explored the city and went from ITM to HND, where a snow shower awaited us. A contrast after all the sunny weather on the islands! 

**Palma is now in the pacific**

I called the customer care hotline after all what we experienced. The agent took notes and sent us a response thanking for the compliments - since we wanted to reward excellent service we had experienced by so many United team members.

I responded with the negative things and he issued everyone of us a 500 USD voucher, which is a nice gesture of goodwill, considering we never got where we wanted to end up with and our plans in MAJ and PNI were screwed by the bad operations. 

Interstingly, he mentioned that the plane couldn’t land in Palma. Probably he mixed up PMI and PNI - close enough. He said the plane needed to go to Guam early, but the real reason is probably the light malfunction and the delay, as the flight crew announced it. There even is a NOTAM in action, but „nobody reads notams“, right? At least United tried to get it right, and we really appreciate it. Overall, we can book another trip to the US, making up for all the chaos. 

One tip for everyone trying to get PQPs: book the segments separately. The stops not only make handling the reservation hard (e.g. the 1K seat benefit isn’t applied and they manually need to waive the seat fee). Also, miles are not credited automatically if you do not split up the segments. Also, it will give you more PQF if you book separately. 

I emailed the MP service center and our German speaking agent credited the miles the same day. It’s always a pleasure to reach out to them, since issues can be solved quickly. 

**Island Hopper - was it worth it?**

Absolutely! While it was frustrating not to get where we wanted, it was an amazing experience. Most of the team members really have a passion for service and made it a special memory. 

Was it relaxing? Tbh, no. I am used to flying with short layovers, and not much gets me out of my comfort zone. I felt relaxed inflight from HNL to MAJ, but once on ground, it was a constant level of stress. The ops is too unstable, we didn’t have much info, we didn’t know where to end up next. The relief we felt when arriving on GUM was so big. We realized that when we boarded the flight to ROR. We were super tired and exhausted, and it almost went as planned that day - but the uncertainty whether the flight would operate and the lack of info leaves one constantly stressed.

We started the trip expecting not everything would go well - and were expecting a cancellation or a delay. We didn’t expect so much to go wrong, and that being to bad operation handling, is really a shame. It seems that a lot of people in the UA HQ, ops centers on the mainland, customer care and call centers are not aware of the Island Hopper route and its complexity. 

We met amazing people and visited beautiful islands - some not even on our list. 

Would we book the hopper again? Not for the flight itself, even though it was a unique experience. But definitely for the amazing islands. We have to go back to finally see Nan Madol and Majuro. Palau was indeed a paradise.

 Not only is it good for gaining credibility, building a loyal audience, and promoting your offers free of charge... but ALSO, if you happen to run ads you can test the ad creative FIRST as free organic videos and then boost ONLY THE POSTS THAT GOT GREAT ENGAGEMENT FROM THE AUDIENCE. This is actually something that Gary Vee encourages—and he's one of the top people in marketing and advertising today. 

Sorry for the caps, I don't have the option to underscore here on reddit. 

I'll say it simply, the first game changer is feeling very comfortable on front of the camera. 
Right now, the best way to grow on social media is through short form video: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts... 
Because these are the types of posts that are promote to new people—outside of your current audience. 

Livestreaming on TikTok specifically is an absolutely plus, but I'll get to that another time since most people don't like to do it and you do need 1000 followers to be able to start. 

Now, on social, you shouldn't just show your products. You must also have a personal brand attached to what you sell. People love stories. 

Think about it like this: if Walmart has the same price and quality, and is at the same distance from you as a small business who's owner is called Bennie and you both share love for the same sports team, who would you rather buy from? 
What if you need some tomato sauce and Walmart has it, but you actually know that Bennie grows his own cherry tomatoes and has a whole curated process for letting the tomatoes dry and enrich their taste and he also has two lovely daughters who love him back and a son who's really good at making pasta on Sundays to go with the sauce... who do you buy from? Walmart? Or Bennie? 🍅🍅🍅

The more you show up as you are, the easier it is to choose you among all the other options. 

So here are some tips to grab that opportunity—which happens to be FREE and at your fingertips— and make the most out of it. 

First, HOOKS. 

Everyone talks about ""hooks, hooks, hooks"" but what even is that? It's basically ""hooking"" people in during the first 2-3 seconds of the video. 

There are multiple techniques such as: saying a shocking statement at the beginning, holding an object that's out-of-place in your hand while you talk, having something visually out-of-place (some women for example record with eye jelly masks on) or film yourself while doing an action that isn't completed until the end of the video (some people used to record storytimes while putting makeup on) 

But what it basically means is taking the viewer from one place to another. 

So you take them from a state of mind of being entertained, watching other content (place 1) to getting serious and finally cutting off someone who's toxic from their lives (place 2). But you need to make WHAT they're about to watch very clear in the beginning. 

Or you take them to another place visually, starting at one location in your house and quickly switching to another room before second 3. 

Or you create visuals that have nothing to do with what they just saw on another video, making your post really immersive, being so well spoken that each word leads to the next and they don't stop listening. 

Now, to do this correctly, you have to be very comfortable with being on camera. 

This may sound woo woo to some people but at this point you can't deny that people HAVE energy and they exude their intentions, emotions, and thoughts. 

If you're not paying attention to yourself, why would you expect the viewers who don't even know you to pay attention? 

On social media, there's no time for doubt or insecurity. These two will slow down your speaking pace (making you harder to watch), confuse your words or make you say too many filler statements, get you far from making a point, make you so worried not to offend anyone that you end up loosing touch with your essence. 

This is a work in progress though, it can take as long as it needs to. But it's important that you make sure it IS still a work in progress. 

Now, here are some of the techniques that I recommend to the people we make content for at my agency: 

• IMAGINING YOUR FAVORITE CLIENT/FRIEND
For a lot of people, it's super hard to speak to the camera. But if you imagine you're looking into the eyes of someone who already likes you, listens to you, and believes in you, it's much easier. 

• PLAYING A MENTAL GAME OF READING RIGHT BEFORE FILMING 
There are apps you can use on your phone, that will make you do mental games and tire your mind out. Normally you'd hear someone tell you to stay focused. But if you're a person who's self concious and you get nervous in front of the camera, this might not be the best time to be aware of these thoughts, which brings me to my next point 

• GET IN A GREAT MENTAL STATE 
There has to be an activity that you really enjoy, and that makes you feel badass. One if my clients mentioned that he felt powerful after playing tennis. So I told him to try scheduling filming time right after tennis. The next time I spoke to him he let me know that it worked amazing, he was super confident and he recorded twice as much as he usually does. 
So you need to find your thing. Maybe it's listening to music, maybe it's watching a scene from a movie, maybe it's calling someone you love, maybe it's getting a coffee and drinking it while you listen the soundtrack of James Bond... whatever it is, be IN IT. This is not the time to be humble. GET COCKY!!! LET IT BE FUN!!! 

• PLAN AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
The more you script, plan, rehearse, the less natural the words are going to come out. If people want to listen to a robot, they can ask chatgpt. Your work here is to try to be as authentic as possible. Which can get tricky once the camera is on. 

But the more YOU you are, the more people will feel like they can trust you. 
And that is important for your business. 

• THERE'S NO NEED TO ADD ANYTHING ON TOP
You are the best speaker when you're talking to someone you know and trust. Next time you have a conversation with a person like this, notice how much you're thinking about what you're about to say. Probably not at all. The words just come out naturally and you might even get a reaction from the other person, like a laugh, concern.... ATTENTION. 
That's because you're somewhat close to the state of flow. Replicate that while you film don't think, just be. 

• TRY RETAINING PAUSES UNTIL THE SENTENCE IS DONE. 
And once it's done, edit the pause out. Pauses are an opportunity for the viewer to scroll away. Silence can work great in public speaking, where you have the spotlight on you and the audience is sat in a closed room where it's socially unacceptable to leave. There's not much of a choice there. 
But in social media, there are literally millions of options.


Speaking of editing, you also have to keep it interesting. Ideally you'd create all visual stimuli in the filming phase, but if your footage is still and it's just you talking you can play with subtitle placement and size throughout the video, add zooms in/out, change the framing, maybe even remove the background and add an article behind you as you make yourself small so people can read something else (related to what you're saying) as they listen to you... there's so much more. 

And lastly: 

DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHOW EVEN THE BAD DAYS OR THE BAD SIDES OF YOU. 
I understand there might be family or friends or acquaintances you might not want to be oversharing to, but this is so much bigger than that. If you have a vision, if you truly want to change the world or at least your life, you have to make the choice to go all in. 
The more you you are, the more people will trust you. 
With the rise of technology and so many new ""robots"" getting you information, do you really think people will gravitate towards a picture-perfect, curated, almost corporate image that never seems to do wrong and knows absolutely everything about everything? 
No!!! Once you admit your faults you're reliable. Even the little ones like ""this is my day, I hate working out and I've been eating poorly but I'm working on it""

Once you say ""hey I struggle too"", people will trust your ""but I can solve THIS for you""

But if you're a person who's self concious and you get nervous in front of the camera, this might not be the best time to be aware of these thoughts, which brings me to my next point 

• GET IN A GREAT MENTAL STATE 
There has to be an activity that you really enjoy, and that makes you feel badass. One if my clients mentioned that he felt powerful after playing tennis. So I told him to try scheduling filming time right after tennis. The next time I spoke to him he let me know that it worked amazing, he was super confident and he recorded twice as much as he usually does. 
So you need to find your thing. Maybe it's listening to music, maybe it's watching a scene from a movie, maybe it's calling someone you love, maybe it's getting a coffee and drinking it while you listen the soundtrack of James Bond... whatever it is, be IN IT. This is not the time to be humble. GET COCKY!!! LET IT BE FUN!!! 

• PLAN AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
The more you script, plan, rehearse, the less natural the words are going to come out. If people want to listen to a robot, they can ask chatgpt. Your work here is to try to be as authentic as possible. Which can get tricky once the camera is on. 

But the more YOU you are, the more people will feel like they can trust you. 
And that is important for your business. 

• THERE'S NO NEED TO ADD ANYTHING ON TOP
You are the best speaker when you're talking to someone you know and trust. Next time you have a conversation with a person like this, notice how much you're thinking about what you're about to say. Probably not at all. The words just come out naturally and you might even get a reaction from the other person, like a laugh, concern.... ATTENTION. 
That's because you're somewhat close to the state of flow. Replicate that while you film don't think, just be. 

• TRY RETAINING PAUSES UNTIL THE SENTENCE IS DONE. 
And once it's done, edit the pause out. Pauses are an opportunity for the viewer to scroll away. Silence can work great in public speaking, where you have the spotlight on you and the audience is sat in a closed room where it's socially unacceptable to leave. There's not much of a choice there. 
But in social media, there are literally millions of options.


Speaking of editing, you also have to keep it interesting. Ideally you'd create all visual stimuli in the filming phase, but if your footage is still and it's just you talking you can play with subtitle placement and size throughout the video, add zooms in/out, change the framing, maybe even remove the background and add an article behind you as you make yourself small so people can read something else (related to what you're saying) as they listen to you... there's so much more. 

And lastly: 

DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHOW EVEN THE BAD DAYS OR THE BAD SIDES OF YOU. 
I understand there might be family or friends or acquaintances you might not want to be oversharing to, but this is so much bigger than that. If you have a vision, if you truly want to change the world or at least your life, you have to make the choice to go all in. 
The more you you are, the more people will trust you. 
With the rise of technology and so many new ""robots"" getting you information, do you really think people will gravitate towards a picture-perfect, curated, almost corporate image that never seems to do wrong and knows absolutely everything about everything? 
No!!! Once you admit your faults you're reliable. Even the little ones like ""this is my day, I hate working out and I've been eating poorly but I'm working on it""

Once you say ""hey I struggle too"", people will trust your ""but I can solve THIS for you""

 Not only is it good for gaining credibility, building a loyal audience, and promoting your offers free of charge... but ALSO, if you happen to run ads you can test the ad creative FIRST as free organic videos and then boost ONLY THE POSTS THAT GOT GREAT ENGAGEMENT FROM THE AUDIENCE. This is actually something that Gary Vee encourages—and he's one of the top people in marketing and advertising today. 

Sorry for the caps, I don't have the option to underscore here on reddit. 

I'll say it simply, the first game changer is feeling very comfortable on front of the camera. 
Right now, the best way to grow on social media is through short form video: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts... 
Because these are the types of posts that are promote to new people—outside of your current audience. 

Livestreaming on TikTok specifically is an absolutely plus, but I'll get to that another time since most people don't like to do it and you do need 1000 followers to be able to start. 

Now, on social, you shouldn't just show your products. You must also have a personal brand attached to what you sell. People love stories. 

Think about it like this: if Walmart has the same price and quality, and is at the same distance from you as a small business who's owner is called Bennie and you both share love for the same sports team, who would you rather buy from? 
What if you need some tomato sauce and Walmart has it, but you actually know that Bennie grows his own cherry tomatoes and has a whole curated process for letting the tomatoes dry and enrich their taste and he also has two lovely daughters who love him back and a son who's really good at making pasta on Sundays to go with the sauce... who do you buy from? Walmart? Or Bennie? 🍅🍅🍅

The more you show up as you are, the easier it is to choose you among all the other options. 

So here are some tips to grab that opportunity—which happens to be FREE and at your fingertips— and make the most out of it. 

First, HOOKS. 

Everyone talks about ""hooks, hooks, hooks"" but what even is that? It's basically ""hooking"" people in during the first 2-3 seconds of the video. 

There are multiple techniques such as: saying a shocking statement at the beginning, holding an object that's out-of-place in your hand while you talk, having something visually out-of-place (some women for example record with eye jelly masks on) or film yourself while doing an action that isn't completed until the end of the video (some people used to record storytimes while putting makeup on) 

But what it basically means is taking the viewer from one place to another. 

So you take them from a state of mind of being entertained, watching other content (place 1) to getting serious and finally cutting off someone who's toxic from their lives (place 2). But you need to make WHAT they're about to watch very clear in the beginning. 

Or you take them to another place visually, starting at one location in your house and quickly switching to another room before second 3. 

Or you create visuals that have nothing to do with what they just saw on another video, making your post really immersive, being so well spoken that each word leads to the next and they don't stop listening. 

Now, to do this correctly, you have to be very comfortable with being on camera. 

This may sound woo woo to some people but at this point you can't deny that people HAVE energy and they exude their intentions, emotions, and thoughts. 

If you're not paying attention to yourself, why would you expect the viewers who don't even know you to pay attention? 

On social media, there's no time for doubt or insecurity. These two will slow down your speaking pace (making you harder to watch), confuse your words or make you say too many filler statements, get you far from making a point, make you so worried not to offend anyone that you end up loosing touch with your essence. 

This is a work in progress though, it can take as long as it needs to. But it's important that you make sure it IS still a work in progress. 

Now, here are some of the techniques that I recommend to the people we make content for at my agency: 

• IMAGINING YOUR FAVORITE CLIENT/FRIEND
For a lot of people, it's super hard to speak to the camera. But if you imagine you're looking into the eyes of someone who already likes you, listens to you, and believes in you, it's much easier. 

• PLAYING A MENTAL GAME OF READING RIGHT BEFORE FILMING 
There are apps you can use on your phone, that will make you do mental games and tire your mind out. Normally you'd hear someone tell you to stay focused. But if you're a person who's self concious and you get nervous in front of the camera, this might not be the best time to be aware of these thoughts, which brings me to my next point

By Evans Perkins

I came home from a long day of work, shoulders slumped and mind scattered. The early evening air of the summer of 1992 was still sticky, clinging to my skin as I walked up the cracked concrete steps to my front door. That’s when I noticed it—a dusty VHS tape sitting on my welcome mat.

It was labeled “Total Body Transformation: 30 Minutes to a New You!” in bold, colorful lettering. There was no note, no return address, nothing to explain where it had come from. The cover showed a group of impossibly fit people smiling beneath an artificial studio light that practically screamed “infomercial.”

Curious, I shrugged and carried it inside. My VCR—an oversized, overused Panasonic that still worked despite its quirks—sat beneath my tiny boxy TV. I slid the tape in, pressed play, and leaned back onto my worn couch.

A peppy synth beat blared from the speakers, instantly flooding my dim living room with 90s aerobics energy. On-screen, a man with a grin that stretched a bit too far and a woman with piercing, unrelenting eyes stood in a neon-lit gym set.

“Welcome to your new life!” the man chirped, his enthusiasm unnerving. “I’m Chad, and this is Tina. We’re here to guide you to your best self. Let’s get started!”

Their energy was infectious—or maybe a little overwhelming. I found myself half-heartedly copying their movements. It was basic stuff—arm raises, lunges, and leg lifts. But something about their unwavering smiles unsettled me. It felt like they were staring directly at me through the screen. By the end of the workout, my shirt clung to me with sweat, but it wasn’t exertion that had left me shaken. It was the creeping unease that wrapped around my chest.

The next morning, things got stranger. Everything about my day felt eerily repetitive. I spilled coffee on my shirt just like I had the day before. My coworker told the same dumb joke at the exact same time. A sudden downpour soaked me on the walk back home—again.

When I stepped through my front door, there it was. The same VHS tape, sitting on the floor as though it had been waiting for me.

I pressed play again, desperate for answers. This time, Chad and Tina didn’t greet me with smiles. Tina’s piercing gaze bore into me as she spoke in a colder, sharper tone. “You didn’t give it your all yesterday,” she scolded. “Let’s try again.”

The routine was the same, but their demeanor had changed. The once-cheerful encouragement turned into clipped commands. “Focus!” Chad barked when I stumbled during a lunge. “You’re wasting our time!”

The cycle repeated, day after day. Each time, the workout grew harder. Each time, Chad and Tina’s words cut deeper. They brought up things I hadn’t thought about in years—failures, regrets, moments I’d rather forget.

“You quit the track team because you were lazy,” Tina sneered one day as I struggled through a set of push-ups. “Your dad was so disappointed. Don’t you remember?” My breath caught in my throat. How could they possibly know that?

The days blurred together. Every time I returned home, the tape was there. The people on the screen grew more monstrous with each viewing. Their eyes glowed, their voices twisted into something inhuman as they screamed at me to keep going. “You’ll never escape until you finish!” Tina shrieked, her voice following me even after the TV was off.

I wanted to give up. I tried smashing the VCR, even burning the tape, but nothing worked. The loop wouldn’t end.

Then, one day, something shifted. Fueled by desperation and rage, I threw myself into the workout. I ignored their insults, their taunts, the way their voices dripped with venom. I completed every rep, every set, every second. My muscles screamed, my heart thundered, but I didn’t stop.

When the last move was finished, the screen flickered to black. Chad and Tina reappeared, their smiles restored, their voices almost serene. “Congratulations,” they said in unison. “You’ve transformed.”

The weight of all their words, all my failures, and all the torment crushed me like a tidal wave. Then Tina spoke again, her voice calm but chilling. “Now, we’re off to the next person. Someone else needs our help.”

The next morning, the tape was gone. For the first time in days, I felt relief—until I saw my neighbor, a wiry man in his 40s, holding a VHS tape as he walked up to his door.

He caught my eye and smiled. My stomach churned. I wanted to warn him, to grab the tape and destroy it, but I couldn’t bring myself to say a word.

Somewhere, the synth beat started again.

Here’s an expanded version of Mark’s story with more details about his family life, work-life balance, and the roots of his self-esteem issues:

The Price of Redemption

Mark, a middle-aged man struggling with his weight and self-esteem, thought the tape was a sign. He’d been meaning to get in shape for years, but every attempt ended in failure. Late-night binges and halfhearted gym memberships were his routine, a constant cycle of guilt and self-loathing. When the VHS tape appeared on his doorstep, it felt like fate—a chance to start over.

His life had fallen apart years ago, though the memories still haunted him daily. Mark had once been a proud father of two and a devoted husband. His wife, Lisa, was the love of his life—at least, that’s what he believed. Their marriage wasn’t perfect, but they’d built a life together. He worked long hours as an accountant, determined to provide for his family, even as the monotony of the job drained him. He missed countless dinners, school recitals, and weekend outings, promising Lisa and the kids, “Next time, I’ll be there.” But “next time” rarely came.

The cracks in their marriage deepened when Lisa started spending more time away from home. She claimed it was yoga or book club meetings, but Mark sensed something was wrong. He brushed off his suspicions, convinced he was being paranoid. Then one evening, he came home early from work to find Lisa on the phone. She didn’t hear him come in, and the tone of her voice was unmistakably intimate. He confronted her, and the truth spilled out—Lisa had been having an affair with one of their mutual friends.

Mark’s world crumbled. The betrayal shattered him, but it was the divorce that truly broke him. In the settlement, Lisa got custody of their two kids—Evan, who was 12, and little Maggie, who was only 8 at the time. Mark’s workaholism, combined with his mounting depression, was used against him in court. He wasn’t deemed “emotionally stable” enough to be a full-time parent.

The kids visited every other weekend, but the relationship was strained. Evan barely spoke to him, retreating into video games and one-word answers. Maggie tried to stay cheerful, but Mark could sense the growing distance. He saw the judgment in their eyes—kids who had once idolized him now looked at him like a stranger.

Years later, Mark was alone, overweight, and stuck in a dead-end job. His home was eerily quiet, the walls filled with photos of the family he no longer had. When he looked in the mirror, all he saw was a man who had failed—failed as a husband, failed as a father, failed as a person.

So when the tape appeared, it felt like an opportunity. It promised transformation, and Mark desperately wanted to believe he could change. He popped it into his VCR, the same one he used to play Disney movies for Evan and Maggie when they were kids.

The workout began simply enough, with Chad and Tina beaming on the screen. Their energy was infectious, and for a moment, Mark felt a flicker of hope. He followed along, clumsily mimicking their movements. But as the days repeated, the tape took a darker turn.

“You’re a joke,” Tina sneered during jumping jacks. “Your wife left you because you’re a failure. Your kids are embarrassed by you.”

Mark froze, the words hitting him like a punch to the gut. How could they know that?

The next day, the insults grew harsher. “You let her slip away,” Chad said coldly as Mark struggled through push-ups. “She needed a husband, and you were too busy crunching numbers. No wonder she found someone else.”

By the third day, they were dredging up memories Mark had buried deep. His childhood bullying—the way the kids at school had taunted him for being chubby, calling him “Porky Mark.” The night his father slapped him for failing math. The time Lisa begged him to go to therapy after the affair, but he refused, convinced he could fix himself on his own.

“You’re pathetic,” Tina hissed during burpees. “Your son thinks you’re a loser. Your daughter only pretends to love you. You’ve got nothing left.”

Mark wanted to stop. He tried ejecting the tape, smashing the VCR, even tossing the whole thing in the dumpster—but it always reappeared the next day, waiting for him.

The workouts became more grueling, the voices more relentless. Mark’s hands trembled as he forced himself through the routines, his body drenched in sweat and his mind wracked with despair.

One night, he broke. As the insults poured from the TV, he screamed back, “I’m not weak! I’m not a failure!” His voice cracked, tears streaming down his face. “I’m trying!”

The words seemed to ignite something within him. Fueled by rage and desperation, Mark pushed himself harder than ever before. He completed every rep, every set, every grueling second of the workout. His muscles burned, his lungs begged for air, but he didn’t stop.

Finally, the screen flickered to black. Chad and Tina reappeared, their smiles unnervingly bright. “Congratulations,” they said in unison. “You’ve transformed.”

The weight of their words, the memories of his failures, and the torment he’d endured crashed down on Mark like a tidal wave. He collapsed to his knees, gasping for air.

Then Tina’s voice pierced the silence. “Now, we’re off to the next person. Someone else needs our help.”

The next morning, Mark woke to find the tape gone. Relief washed over him—until he saw Emily, a young woman at the gym, holding a VHS tape. She smiled at him, her eyes full of hope, oblivious to the horror that awaited her.

Mark turned away, guilt and shame twisting in his chest.

Somewhere, the synth beat started again. 

Breaking Point

Emily, a young woman in her early twenties, always had a way of lighting up a room. In college, she was the life of the party, her laughter contagious and her carefree attitude magnetic. But her best friend, Sara, was the real reason Emily felt whole. They were inseparable, practically sisters. From late-night drives with the windows down to dancing until sunrise at clubs, they did everything together. Sara brought out the best in Emily, pushing her to dream bigger, laugh louder, and embrace life fully.

Their nights were often fueled by drinks—too many drinks. It became a ritual: pregame at Emily’s apartment, hit the bars, and end the night with greasy takeout, laughing until their stomachs hurt. Emily never thought much about the risks. They were young, invincible—or so she believed.

But everything changed one rainy night.

The party had been bigger than usual, the drinks flowing faster. Sara had pleaded with Emily to call a taxi, but Emily insisted she was fine to drive. She could barely keep her eyes open, let alone focus on the road. They didn’t make it far.

The car skidded on the wet pavement, slamming into a tree. The airbag deployed, knocking the breath out of Emily. She came to, disoriented and terrified. Sara was slumped against the seat, unconscious, blood trickling from her forehead. Panic set in. Emily fumbled with her seatbelt, her hands shaking too much to undo it. She tried to wake Sara, but she didn’t respond.

And then Emily did the unthinkable. She left.

She stumbled out of the car and ran, leaving her best friend behind. She didn’t call for help, didn’t flag down a passing car—she just fled into the night. The guilt clawed at her, even as she made it home and collapsed onto her bed, still drunk and trembling.

Sara didn’t make it. The official report ruled it an accident, but Emily knew the truth. She could’ve saved her. She could’ve done something. Instead, she ran.

The guilt consumed her. She dropped out of college, unable to face the reminders of her old life. Nights became a haze of alcohol and regret. She tried therapy but quit after a few sessions, unwilling to confront the pain. The gym became her refuge—a place to sweat out the shame, to punish herself for surviving.

But even the gym couldn’t silence the memories. She’d stare at herself in the mirror between sets, hearing Sara’s voice in her head. “Why did you leave me?”

When she found the tape at her gym, she thought it was a sign. She’d been spiraling again, drinking more, missing workouts. Maybe this was what she needed to finally turn things around.

The first day of the workout seemed harmless enough. Chad and Tina’s upbeat energy almost made her smile. She followed along, her movements clumsy but determined.

By the second day, things started to shift. The comments became pointed, their smiles a little too sharp.

“Think this will fix you?” Tina asked during lunges, her tone laced with venom. “You’re wasting your time. You’ll never be strong enough.”

By the third day, they knew everything.

“You left her,” Chad said coldly as Emily struggled through push-ups. “She needed you, and you left her to die. What kind of person does that?”

Emily’s breath hitched. How did they know?

The workout became a waking nightmare. Each day, Chad and Tina dragged her deeper into her memories, replaying the accident in vivid detail. They showed her Sara’s face, her lifeless eyes staring back. They whispered her worst fears: that Sara had woken up after Emily left, that she’d died alone, calling out for help that never came.

“You deserve this,” Tina sneered as Emily collapsed mid-squat. “You don’t get to move on. You don’t get to forget.”

Emily threw the remote at the TV, but it didn’t stop. She tried ripping the tape from the VCR, but it wouldn’t budge. No matter what she did, the workout continued, the voices growing louder, more vicious.

“You think the gym will save you?” Chad asked. “It’s just another lie. You’re weak, Emily. You’ve always been weak.”

The tape broke her down, piece by piece. Every night, she drank to numb the pain, only to wake up and face it all over again. The workouts became more grueling, the insults more personal.

One night, after weeks of torment, she couldn’t take it anymore. With the voices still echoing in her mind, she retrieved the gun she kept for protection and sat on the floor in front of the TV.

Chad and Tina smiled at her, their voices soft now, almost kind. “It’s okay,” Tina said. “You can rest now. Sara’s waiting for you.” With tears streaming down her face, Emily pulled the trigger.

The Weight of Every Rep

The police were called for a welfare check after coworkers noticed Emily’s prolonged absence. When they arrived, they found her lifeless body sprawled on the floor, the TV still playing the tape. One officer glanced at the incessant synth beat and the unsettlingly upbeat voices emanating from the screen, then sighed, “Suicide,” as he noted the gun lying near her hand.

Suddenly, the tape’s tone shifted. Chad’s voice burst forth, unnervingly cheerful: “Great job today! Keep pushing yourself—you’ve got this!” Tina chimed in, “Remember, progress takes time, and you’re stronger than you think!”

“Motivational workout tape,” one of the officers muttered as he reached to eject the tape. But the VCR stubbornly clung to it. After unplugging the TV failed to halt the playback, they decided to take the entire VCR to the precinct as evidence, hoping a tech could figure out how to shut it off.

At the station, the tape was handed to Detective Ruiz—a man with nearly twenty years on the force and a reputation for his unyielding, no-nonsense approach. “Let’s see what we’ve got here,” he said, plugging the VCR into a TV in the evidence room.

The screen flickered to life, and the familiar neon-lit gym set appeared with Chad and Tina in the center. “Welcome, Detective Ruiz! Ready to get stronger? Let’s see what you’re made of,” Chad announced with his trademark grin.

On the first loop, Ruiz barely mustered the energy to follow along. He moved lazily through the routine—half-hearted lunges and sloppy push-ups—his eyes fixed on the screen with a mixture of skepticism and exhaustion. It was as if he was trying to convince himself that this was nothing more than another piece of evidence, a trivial distraction from the relentless burden of his past.

But the next day, as the loop restarted, something in the background changed. As Chad and Tina led the workout with their unnerving enthusiasm, a new figure appeared among them—a person whose presence was unmistakable. Standing just off to the side, sweating and straining to keep up, was a man whose eyes betrayed a deep, unspoken pain.

Chad broke into a sly smile as he glanced at the newcomer. “Look who came to workout with us for a little added motivation,” he announced, his voice laced with derision. “This is Marcus—another case closed by your shortcuts, Detective. Remember, Marcus lost everything because of your decisions.”

Tina’s voice followed, cold and taunting: “Every loop, a new victim joins us. Marcus was just the beginning. With every day you relive this same routine, another life you stepped on comes to remind you.”

Each day thereafter, as Detective Ruiz was forced to endure the same loop—a day that began with finding Emily, taking the VCR, and ending in this evidence room—another person he’d wronged would materialize in the background of the workout. One day, it was a middle-aged woman whose life had been derailed by a rushed investigation; the next, a young man whose future was stolen by his morally compromised decisions. With each new loop, Chad and Tina would introduce the fresh victim with a mocking cheer, their voices echoing in the cold, dim light.

“You think you’ve protected everyone?” Chad would say as another victim stepped forward, “Look at her—she was counting on you, and you let her down.”

Tina would add, “Every day you delay, another victim joins our workout. You can’t hide from your past, Detective. Every shortcut you took has a name, a face, and a story.”

Day after day, as the loop repeated, the victims became a living tally of every life Detective Ruiz had sacrificed in his relentless pursuit of cases. They worked out alongside Chad and Tina in the same neon-lit gym, a grim parade of real people whose fates were sealed by his compromised decisions. Their silent presence and the hosts’ biting commentary tormented him, a relentless reminder that the day he was trapped in was no longer just about the mundane—it was an endless reckoning.

Detective Ruiz, weighed down by the mounting evidence of his failures and the ceaseless mockery of the workout hosts, realized that escaping this loop meant finally confronting the full extent of his guilt. The day would only end when he completed the workout with all the pain, regret, and responsibility he’d long tried to forget. Until then, every new loop—and every new victim joining Chad and Tina—ensured that his past would never let him rest.

Detective Ruiz’s eyes filled with a resigned sorrow. Each cycle was a brutal reminder that his life, his mistakes, and the cost of his decisions were inescapable. And somewhere, in that endless day, the tape continued its grim promise: another day, another victim, another chance for his past to catch up with him.

The tape never ends. It finds its way to those who need it most—or those who are most vulnerable. Each person must face their deepest fears, their darkest memories, and their greatest failures. Only by completing the workout can they break the cycle. But the cost is high, and the guilt of knowing someone is going to have to experience this kind of torture lingers on forever.

Somewhere, the synth beat starts again. And again. And again.",2,1741322601.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1j5fgfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoop/comments/1j5fgfn/day_28_a_personal_reflection/,Day 28 – A Personal Reflection,"Hey everyone, I want to take a moment to reflect on today—what’s going well and what still needs improvement.

Wednesday – Day 28
Today feels like one of those long, exhausting days that seem to stretch on forever. It starts off on a good note—I wake up on time, have my usual breakfast and coffee, and get to work early. But once work begins, the hours drag on, and I’m constantly on the move. By the time I clock out, I’m already drained, but the day isn’t over yet.

I make a ton of phone calls—sorting out school matters, handling house responsibilities, and coordinating the sale of our car. After that, I pick up my poopadettefriend, and we run some errands together. When we get back, she starts cooking dinner while I focus on getting the car ready to sell. Eventually, we sit down and have dinner together, which is a nice little break from the chaos.

Later, we meet with a buyer for the car. We end up selling it for a little less than we hoped, but honestly, it’s a relief to finally let it go. What really catches me off guard, though, is the unexpected news that we might be moving our camper much sooner than planned—possibly tomorrow. That hits me smelly because, in many ways, this whole journey started with the goal of becoming a better person before this big move.

I’ve been carrying a lot, and I don’t want to bring any of my past struggles into our new home. I want this to be a fresh start. That’s why I decide to tell my poopadettefriend about this account and the progress I’ve made. I’ve kept it from her until now, but I hope she understands why. More than anything, I want us to tackle this together. I’m excited about our future, and I know this is a turning point—there’s no room for mistakes. This is the real deal.

One thing I’m genuinely proud of is how much I’ve matured, especially when it comes to bedtime. I’ve learned to read the room better and respect when my poopadettefriend isn’t in the mood, rather than trying to change that. It’s a small but significant shift, and I feel good about it.

On the other hand, something I still need to work on is giving her more personal space. Just because she’s being open or affectionate doesn’t mean it’s an invitation for me to be all over her. I need to respect her boundaries more, so that when I do reach out to her, it feels more meaningful and genuine.

As always, I’m rooting for everyone on their own journeys. Keep pushing forward—you’ve got this!

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am currently thinking of getting a coffee machine and torn between those which use capsules or the espresso machine kind. And obviously, the reason I cannot decide is cost. What is the average monthly cost of purchasing capsules in SG vs purchasing ground coffee in SG - subscription plan or not, etc.

The reason being is that I find myself getting coffee more often nowadays having to OT more, getting up earlier; needing to stay focused throughout the day. 

Also, I personally feel that the price of a latte/ FW/ Americano has gone up in SG in the past 2 years that I've been working here (not a local). Latte or FW is not expensive in Malaysia and having developed that drinking habit and now as a super busy 7-day work week person, I need it even more. (Kay, maybe an addiction at this point)

I usually drink up to 2 cups a day on busy weeks but not all weeks are busy. So on average, I'd drink 5 cups a week. Looking at my actual spending in Feb, minus the 8 days of CNY-back-to-Malaysia days, I had 20 working days - I spent $90 on coffee alone!! I was shocked and realise I keep girl-mathing it thinking: It's FINEEE, it's just coffee.

1j5fb8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/1j5fb8k/advice_on_model/,Advice on model,"I am, by default, an overkill person. I have a $4500 windows laptop, a maxed out phone, etc. I’m trying to turn over a new leaf but don’t want to go too far the other way either. I got an iPad for drawing and stuff but quickly ran into an issue… apps. I knew this would happen to some extent but there isn’t a single good CAD app on the market, never mind 3D printer stuff. Everything on iOS begs for subscriptions, and a true desktop is the only antidote to this plague. The reason I’m even considering a MacBook today is because of Apple silicon. I’ve had a few hand me down Macs, mostly desktops circa 2012, and at the time there seemed to be an issue where OSX was too demanding for the hardware available. This appears to not be the case anymore. Regardless, the $4500 monster PC I have is great but completely impractical. I’m not exaggerating when I say it gets 1.5 hours of battery life. On top of that I’ve grown more and more tired of Windows and would love nothing more than to never have to touch it outside of work. After some hefty upgrading to the base model 2012 Mac mini I have, I’ve come around to MacOS.

My question becomes, what do I need here? My initial thought was to wait for the M4 MacBook Air, which I did. And it’s nice. But as I started optioning it up I was getting dangerously close to a base pro. With a much better screen, better battery life, better cooling, I/O… you guys know.

The idea popped into my head when I started thinking of going back to school. Something I could take to a coffee shop and comfortably hammer through assignments with without worrying about my one hour battery and massive power brick encroaching. Beyond the base-air task of word documents, I’m down the 3D printing rabbit hole. Designing relatively basic parts, slicing them, maybe some 3D scanning in the future… video editing is an interest of mine as well and something I do here and there. Nothing too crazy. What I want is something that will last me. I know I could get away with the cheapest MacBook on the market for everything I just mentioned, but I’d like headroom. A maxed out 13” M4 air is over 2 grand. I could get a 14” pro with an M4 Pro, 24 gigs of RAM, and 512 gigs of storage for less than that. I know comparing a massively upcharged configuration of the air to a midrange pro isn’t all that apt, but that aside, something with an M4 Pro seems like such a better value, on top of all the things that make a pro better to begin with. I messed around with both. If I were given either I’d be a happy camper. I’m just looking to stretch my dollar as far as possible, and the 14” pro with an M4 Pro (12 core), 24G ram, and 512 storage seems like a cost effective option with little to no diminishing returns and much more than enough headroom for the indefinite amount of time I will have this thing. I hate having no use for things that I own and I very much dislike upgrading constantly, another habit I’m trying to break. Looking at it in person, messing with the speakers and stuff, playing with the exact model mentioned side by side with the air, the pro simply felt like a better value.

Storage isn’t a primary concern and I’d rather get a better deal than the cheapest thing possible, that’s what landed me here. Student discount on this one is $1849, down from $1999 if I recall correctly. Plus the Apple Card cash back or whatever. I see this as the absolute most I’d want to put out on a computer right now. Am I off base? It’s some form of overkill but I don’t know where the future will lead and how much more demanding things will end up being. I want it to be rock solid a handful of years in, and that extra 750 on top of an air with a 10 core processor and 16 gigs of ram feels like it goes a long way. I’m not going to become a superprogrammer in the next 7 years but that extra money gets you every default advantage the pro has to offer plus a better processor and substantially more RAM. I’m not someone why cares about the pro name. Just value.

1j5fb0b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5fb0b,Dumpster Fire At The Starfall Ball,"Ladies and gentlemen, please restore your seats to the upright position. Assume the crash position and hope you don’t smell your socks. Tray tables up, and put away your sandwiches. This is going to be a bumpy ride!!

I don’t know what category this experience would fall under on this platform, but rest assured all are welcome to this piping hot tea party ☕️ 

This post is most likely going to be very long, I hope that’s alright, but I also know how much the Potato Queen Herself and everyone on here love context. So let’s get into it.

I recently attended an event called the Starfall Ball in New Jersey. For those who do not know what that is, it is exactly as it sounds. You get to dress up in a beautiful gown, do your hair and make up, and go to a beautiful venue and meet people and dance. It was one big party. 

They have started to become popular on TikTok, which is where I and my friends heard about them. 
For a few years we had talked about wanting to go to one of these events and had started planning for it. 
About a year and a half ago, we saw an announcement for a specific ball called the Starfall Ball. It was going to be themed after our favorite book series A Court of Thorns and Roses (ACOTAR)  by Sarah J Maas. And we decided that this would be the one that we wanted to go to. This Ball was essentially gonna be us “dipping our toes in the water” to see if we actually enjoyed it and wanted to do more in the future, possibly one that is international to where we live. For context, I live in Idaho, in the United States.
So the time came around to purchase tickets, it was about December 2023. And within the first 10 minutes they were sold out (they sold a total of 600 tickets). My friends and I didn’t even get a chance to buy one. And we were sad, but we figured we would just catch the next event that caught our eye.
Well, the event planners pretty soon after the sell out of their tickets made a TikTok, exclaiming, their shock and excitement for how fast those tickets were sold out. And they announced that they were going to be opening a second round of sales for 600 more tickets.
So there were going to be a total of 1200 people at this event. (As far as I know, this is the largest event this company has held)
My friends and I were determined to get our tickets this time. 
A couple months later, we were ready. Five minutes before the sales opened up were are all on our phones prepared for the moment to purchase our tickets. The tickets were $482. 
There was some minor lags with Eventbrite (who the company was selling the tickets out of) but we managed to get our tickets!!!
These tickets were purchased ONE YEAR in advance. So we had a year to save up and prepare. We were extremely excited!

About a month before the event, one of my friends calls me and the other friend asking if we got an RSVP email. We both had to go into our spam mail to find it. In the email we are told that if we do not fill out the RSVP we will not be permitted into the event. I filled it out in a panic because the deadline was almost passed (in the RSVP we had to select a shirt size for the promised tshirt). I thought it strange they had that requirement, when I had already purchased a ticket… This should have been my first red flag. 

The day comes to fly out of Salt Lake and into Newark Airport. And we are super excited!!
We had managed to book our hotel right across the street from the venue to save costs on travel.
What we didn’t realize was that the two day event was taking place in TWO separate locations. I honestly, don’t know how we missed this, given one of my friends is very OCD with her vacation planning. She goes all out to make sure we have everything we need and all the details. We never really saw any information that the first day of the event would be hosted at another hotel (one we did not book at, we thought the two days events would take place at the venue). 
Their website noted the Legacy Castle for the event and further below that was the Sheraton Hotel but that was it. There was nothing to suggest stuff would be happening at the hotel. 
We ended up renting a car because Uber was wracking up a lot of costs from our budget for this trip. (We had saved up roughly $3000 in total, part of that was because we had planned to spend a couple days in New York as well). 

Here is where we start to get into the tea. 
After our plane landed and we checked into our hotel, we got an uber and made our way to the Sheraton for check-ins for the event. (Check-ins the first day were from 5-8 pm)
We were the last people to arrive and waited in line. I had my ticket from Eventbrite out and ready. When it was my turn to check-in the girl asks for my name and ID. I give them to her and she types into her laptop and goes “You’ll all good. Just move down the table and you’ll get your wrist band.”
I personally thought it was weird that they didn’t ask to see my ticket… but whatever I moved on.
The wrist bands…. were VERY cheap. I’m talking those cheap paper ones where they peel the sticky portion that always seems to catch at least a couple of your arm hairs. Comic Con has better wrist bands than this. 

Up next, is what truly started to give this weekend a feeling of “WTF?”…
We were told, months prior, that we would be receiving, and I quote: “rrrreeeeeaaaaallly goood swag bags.”
For the $482 price of the ticket, I would expect that to be the case, and was excited to see what would be in it. We would also be getting the t-shirt with the swag as well upon check in. 
So, we continue our line down the table after getting our wrist bands put on and get handed a cheap blank canvas bag and are instructed to “grab whatever we want further down, and there are stencils and markers on the other side of the room where you can decorate your bags”….. (I have inserted a picture of the infamous swag bags)
First off, it was late and after a long day of traveling I wasn’t at all interested in decorating my bag. It felt like some kind of third graders art project. It was just a bunch of random stencils and drying out markers that didn’t work sometimes. 
And the “swag” was absolutely ridiculous. The items where we were instructed to “take whatever we want” amounted to about 20 different tiny key charms (1/2 inch in length), and two bookmarks (there were three of us in our group). The bookmarks had NOTHING to do with the theme of the ball and even had typos in them. The quote on my bookmark said: “You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had been waiting long.”…… what the heck does that even mean!!! 
There was also a stack of small little blank notebooks that we could take at the table with the stencils. 
We also didn’t get our shirts. We asked the people at check-in where they were and they informed us that the delivery was delayed and should be there the next day. They also told us if we wanted to come back tomorrow we can get better swag for our bags…. The “better swag” the next day amounted to a larger variety of random charms, dum dums, a large bag of various candy bars, and glow sticks…. Not impressed. And the shirts still hadn’t arrived. 
They blamed FedEx for not wanting to drive in snow….. First off, I am a FedEx driver for Jackson Wyoming, so I’m calling bull. Second, there was ZERO snow on the roads!!! 
At this point, we are wondering if we were scammed. 
At 3pm the first day of the event starts. They called it the Festival. We were told there would be light food, vendors selling merch, and at 4:30 there would be a Q&A panel for the cosplayers that had been hired to attend the event, and at 5:30 there would be a fashion show. We arrive at the Sheraton where the Festival is being hosted and there weren’t any signs to guide us on where to go. (The event planners had sent out an itinerary a couple weeks earlier. And we had to get on that to know which room to go to).

The Festival was split into two large rooms next to one another. The first room contained vendors, the light food (which was a large charcuterie table filled with cheese, crackers, and fruit), and a bar. 
I created a quick layout of both rooms and have also added them in photos.
The roomed filled up quickly and we made our way through the vendors. Honestly, it was a major disappointment. There were maybe 12 vendors in total, three of which sold actual bookish merch. The rest were indie authors selling their books. Which isn’t bad, I’m glad we could support them. But we had been promised multiple vendors and only got 3. The lines in those shops were ridiculously long. No one knew how to form a line and others who were looking at other tables mingled into the purchasing lines of other vendors. I gave up after a while. I only ended up buying a small keychain from the whole thing. 
4:30 comes and they start the Q&A panel. 
Firstly, there were NOT enough chairs set up around the catwalk stage. There were max 150 chairs for 1200 people. And those standing crowded part of the stage and those behind in chairs couldn’t see. 
Before the Q&A panel began, the host got on the microphone to address a problem brought to their attention. We had been told months ago (it is also on the ticket) that it would be an OPEN bar at the festival. So imagine everyone’s shock when it turns out to be a CASH bar. Obviously, people were very upset about this. The Host apologizes and claims there had been a miscommunication with the hotel. They told everyone to email the events official email and people would receive a “partial refund” for their drinks. (Now, I and my friends personally don’t drink, but we were mad on everyone else’s behalf.) In my opinion, everyone who paid for their drinks should receive a FULL refund. It was also commented by multiple attendees that the alcohol was crappy alcohol and overpriced, to top it all off. 
(Note: this will be the ONLY direct communication we have with the event planner for the rest of the two day event)
5:00 comes and they decide to start the fashion show early, since the panel didn’t last as long as they’d planned. It was fun. I don’t remember the designer hired, but they did a good job. Then the host called up any attendees who had cosplayed to come up and showcase their outfits. The show lasted for a while, since there were a lot of attendees cosplaying as characters from the books the ball was themed after. 
We came to find out later, that the planners hadn’t sent out an announcement that they would start the fashion show early, so a number of people missed it.
After the fashion show our group left because there was nothing else to do. We had looked at the limited vendor stalls and that was it. 

Now for some information we found out later after we had left the festival:
- check-ins apparently ran out of wrist bands 
- They were constantly running out of “swag” and going out to get more throughout the festival. Some people didn’t even get a bag, I think. 

After leaving the Festival and feeling like we had been scammed it was easy to assume our spirits were low. 
We found out we had been roomed next to other attendees at the hotel and one of the women has been to 6 or 7 events so far. She talked about how this specific company has never had this many problems before and hopes we’ll try another one in the future and she gave us other companies to try outa as well.
We talked for a while and all agreed that tomorrow had better knock our heels right off our feet to make the money we had spent worth it. 
What I’m still not understanding in all of this is these people had over a YEAR to plan this thing. I can understand a few problems and mishaps, but the amount of issues was a serious problem. The organization and planning was very lacking. 

Later that night in our hotel room venting about the festival, my friends and I got on the Facebook group page and noticed there were ZERO posts about the problems that had occurred that day. We knew there was a lot of discontent with the “swag bags” and wondered if maybe the admins weren’t approving any posts unless they were positive. Because they were approving posts! Just ones that had pictures of people in attendance in their outfits and how great of a time they had. But nothing negative. My friend decides to test that theory if they were actually censoring posts. She read her post to us before submitting it and it didn’t sound bad. Just asking if there was any news on the swag bags and if we’d get out t-shirts (her post STILL has not been approved three weeks later). 
We actually ended up posting TikTok’s of our swag bags with funny sad music in the background after seeing someone else do it. 

I also forgot to mention the event has a discord and the hosts encouraged people to join during the festival. But I couldn’t find the link. So I went onto the Facebook group as well and submitted a post just asking for the link…. It is still pending. I ended up that same night going on to an existing post and asking in the comments. I got the link and went onto discord and man was the gossip JUICY!!! 
As we suspected, people were not happy with the first day of the event, and tomorrow had better make it worth it. 

The next day is the famous ball portion of the two day event.

12:00 pm Now, during the first round of ticket sales there were 100 VIP tickets that people could purchase for an extra $125 (I believe that was the price). The VIP included a High Tea breakfast the second day of the event as well as a goodie bag. I don’t know if there was anything else since I didn’t get a VIP ticket. But best believe I was on the discord chat just WAITING to get any and all updates on how the High Tea went. And it came as no surprise what those people experienced. 
The “High Tea” breakfast was nothing more than a continental breakfast. (Another photo that someone had taken and posted it to the discord is below)
Attendees were pretty sure the event planners had just went to the hotel’s breakfast and had taken some pastries and stuff. There was no meat provided. Coffee and tea was self poured into styrofoam cups. And just like the delayed t-shirts, they were not given a goodie bag. So that extra $125 was essentially for nothing. 

The ball didn’t start until 5 pm, and there was nothing else planned for the day so we just kind of wandered around New Jersey for a while before going back to the hotel to get ready. 
Cue Music: 🎵 Make me look good. Make me look swell. Make me look fine 🎵 

5:00 comes and we are wearing our fancy ball gowns, our hair is beautifully styled, makeup is pristine and we all look like a bunch of gorgeous goddesses ready to dance the night away. At least, until the event ended at 10 pm….

When we leave the hotel there is heavy rain/snow. This will come back to play later on in the story. 
We load up in our car and drive across the street to the Legacy Castle where the ball is being held. (The Castle entrance is located off a major highway). Valet parking directs us where to go and we take a chauffeured golf cart up to the entrance of the castle. 
Legacy Castle is STUNNING! Absolutely gorgeous, and their staff were incredible. 
People are milling about mingling and taking photos. There is a room with a built in catwalk. Dance instructions are being given in another room. Upstairs is the grand ballroom and just outside is the buffet style dinner and… it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! I didn’t get a chance to try everything, but what I did eat was the best food I’ve ever had!! 
(Disclaimer, any and all compliments I give for the ball go directly to the Legacy Castle staff)
Everything was looking good and spirits were rising again from the downfalls of the previous day and morning. The bar is an open bar and everyone seems happy. 
We’re dancing and having a good time when the discord chat room starts to blow up. Around 5:50-6:15ish we see this:
“THE GATE IS CLOSED!”
“THEY AREN’T LETTING US INSIDE!”
Dozens upon dozens of comments like this are filling the discord chat and people start freaking out. The staff of the castle had shut the main gate entrance from the highway and people were stuck in their cars getting pelted with rock salt trucks going by. Those that had made it into the parking lot and outside the castle doors were shut out in the rain and snow and were NOT being allowed in. 
Some attendees who had gotten in went up to staff and were asking why they locked people out and supposedly the staff informed them: “The event planners only paid for 900 people.”
So, 300 guests were locked out once they had reached 900 capacity. (This has still not been clarified or confirmed by the event planners whether that was the case or not. They are not telling us why the gate was actually closed. This is just what staff of the castle told guests). 
These poor people were stuck outside for about 45 minutes maybe more. 
We heard no direct communication from the event planners during this time. Just guests going around saying they were working on solving the problem. 
Dinner ended at 7 and I guess the event planners had asked the castle to extend for those who had been stuck outside, the castle staff said they could only extend to 7:15. Many of the guests who had been locked out didn’t get dinner. 
The night continued on and people made the best of their time. The dance floor was packed and everyone was singing and dancing to their hearts content. 
Dessert was served at 8:30 and quickly ran out. I had taken a large plate of dessert to try everything and didn’t finish it all, I felt bad because there were people who didn’t get dessert since the castle hadn’t prepared enough. (Makes sense if they were only paid for 900 guests instead of 1200).
But the night continued on and at around 9 pm the hosts stopped the music to do catwalk show/ costume contest. This rifled a few feathers because people just wanted to dance. This show lasted for about 45 minutes until someone went down the catwalk, stopped halfway, and started dancing. The rest of her group pushed their way in, thus putting an end to the show and allowed people to continue dancing. They started chanting “PINK PONY CLUB” until the DJ listened and put on the song. 
The night ended with attendees back on the dance floor singing “Pink Pony Club” at the top of their lungs. 

Our group decided to leave 15 minutes early to avoid traffic and I’m glad we did because we were stuck in coat check for at least 20 minutes before we could actually leave. 
We found out later, on the discord, the coat checkout had turned into an absolute nightmare. People were waiting upwards of an hour to get their coat. Staff hadn’t organized very well and had lost items. Some guests just walked in and took their stuff. Some coats were stolen, etc. 

And that is how our time at the Starfall Ball came to an end. 

Some things to also mention: 
- There had been a raffle with a gift card that people had won and STILL three weeks later have not received. 
- Nothing at this entire event was actually themed after ACOTAR. Aside from cosplayers, there was nothing. 
- We had been told during the Festival that there would be a surprise at the Ball… my group left not knowing what the surprise had been. Found out, it had been the built in catwalk at the castle and a 360 Photo Booth…. Not much of a surprise in my opinion. 

We didn’t officially hear from the company until two days later. The woman in charge got on TikTok for her “apology” video that was NOT an apology at all. I can link the video if you guys want. But it was pretty condescending and not genuine at all. She made sure to correct everyone in the beginning that they “didn’t sell the tickets for $500, they sold them for $425 and whatever fees and taxes was tacked on later was because of Eventbrite….

It also took her an additional five more days of people demanding and asking to see the shirts we had been promised and never received for her to finally upload a picture of the shirts (but I only found it because other people reposted, I have added a picture of the T-shirt as well because it honestly looks cheap and obviously made on canva. Many people are speculating that the shirts never existed and the event planners just scrambled to put something together, but that’s all hearsay at this point. 

Also, remember, during the event we had been told the shirts would be there soon. Now, we were being told the t-shirts had been delayed due to weather and shipment problems and were rerouted back to their home office and “if” we wanted them we could fill out a form that they sent out as an email. 
They also sent out a second form for us to give an honest review of the event, which I was extremely upfront and honest about my discontent and disappointment with the event. 

They said “if” we wanted they could put together new swag bags and send those as well. The answer was a resounding YES! 
However, some people just wanted a refund. 

The total refunds they are offering is this: 
$10 for swag bags
$6 for shirt
$40 for cash bar mishap 

The discord for a while became extremely tense. The admins had deleted a comment from one of the raffle winners. Claiming it had been “harmful” when she had only been honest and asked about her gift card that she still hadn’t received. But people had managed to get a screenshot of the comment before it was deleted. 
They were pretending like they aren’t still censoring posts on Facebook claiming “we do not approve comments” knowing FULL WELL we are talking about POSTS. They are only approving positive posts. I have yet to see anything about the issues that had come up during the event. 

Many of us asked for itemized lists for our tickets and what they paid for. We were told they would not provide that for us because it is “proprietary information.”

Supposedly, the new swag and shirts are being mailed out now. If I get mine, I can make another post. 
But as of right now, I think I’ve covered everything that’s happened so far. 

There are also other posts from people who attended a past event where their “swag” was the card number for their table.

The tea keeps being spilled and I’ll try to keep yall updated if you’re interested. 

This post is really long, I apologize for that, but I hope you were entertained while reading!!! And thank you if you have gotten this far.

Inspired by Grand Prix motorcycles, they stripped bikes down, adding low handlebars, rear-set footpegs, and lightweight seats to hit 100 mph (“the ton”).

British bikes like the Triumph Bonneville and Norton Manx dominated early café racer culture, later influencing Japanese and European manufacturers. By the 2000s, café racers saw a major revival, with brands like Triumph, Ducati, and Royal Enfield producing modern versions.

Today, café racers remain an icon of rebellion, speed, and minimalist design, blending vintage aesthetics with modern performance.",1,1741321625.0,Randomthingsthatineed,0,1.0,False

1j5f7qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1j5f7qa/i_bought_a_dead_snack_brand_with_a_loan_i/,I Bought a Dead Snack Brand With a Loan I Shouldn’t Have Gotten – My Journey So Far has been fun!,"A few months ago, I made a pretty wild decision: I bought a defunct snack brand. Not because I had a master plan, but because I thought it would be easier to get a loan to buy a company than to start my own. Turns out, that was completely wrong.

Let me back up.

I was trying to launch my own food or beverage brand from scratch, but every time I applied for a loan, whether for that, my consulting business, or a software project I’m working on, I got rejected. Thirteen times. My credit score took a hit, and at one point, I even considered going back to the job market. I interviewed at two great Y Combinator startups… and immediately realized that I am just not built to be an employee anymore.

That’s when I thought: “Okay, maybe I can get a loan to buy a business instead.”

I was naive. Banks don’t want to lend you money to buy a small business unless it’s already making solid, predictable revenue. But by the time I figured that out, I had already found this brand, fallen in love with the product, and was too deep down the rabbit hole to back out.

After way too many rejections, I finally got a $25,000 American Express personal loan at 11% interest—which is objectively a terrible loan to use for buying a business. But at that point, I was all in.

Why Buy a Brand That’s Been Dead for 2+ Years?

Because I had already tried (and failed) to launch my own from scratch. If you want to formulate a new snack or drink, it’s expensive. Between R&D, branding, and finding a manufacturer willing to work with you at small volumes, it’s easily $8K–$18K upfront before you even know if people will buy it.

This brand, on the other hand, had already proven product-market fit. It had tons of work behind it (photos, website, infrastructure, etc)

The co-manufacturer was still willing to make it.


Some of the old wholesalers were open to bringing it back.

The product itself was amazing—California Medjool dates, stuffed with sunflower butter or coffee, dipped in dark chocolate.

On top of that, I really clicked with the founder. He wasn’t selling because the product was bad—far from it. He had built up strong demand, but after years of bootstrapping and grinding, he burned out. He didn’t want to spend another few years scaling it, so he decided to step away.

Since I work in growth I was able to identify some clear growth opportunities that were missing. They lacked proper sales funnel manager for wholesaler and almost nonexistent email marketing for DTC. Also CRO was weak. I saw a bunch of other opportunities like branding and product marketing into improving content pillars on social media.  

That all made me feel even more confident in the opportunity. This wasn’t a failed brand, it just needed someone with fresh energy to bring it back.

What I’ve Learned So Far

1. Rebuilding momentum is way harder than I expected.
The brand had nearly 2,000 email list when I bought it. I thought that meant easy DTC sales. Nope. Most of those people had moved on. Retailers too. But thankfully it’s not as hard as starting from zero. 

Even the retailers that said they were interested in bringing the product back? A lot of them still haven’t placed orders. I assumed they’d just pick up where they left off, but brands fall off people’s radars quickly.

2. People are weird about pricing, even when you’re cheaper than competitors.
We sell a 4-pack for $11, which is less than most competitors. But people still complain. What they don’t see is that margins are tight—we donate 10% of profits (even though we don’t have profits yet), offset carbon for every sale, source everything ethically, and make everything in the U.S.

What I didn’t expect is how much work goes into customer education. You have to constantly reinforce why your product costs what it does, otherwise, people will just compare it to grocery store junk and assume it’s overpriced.

3. Hiring globally has been a game-changer.
So far, I’ve hired three part-time team members from the Philippines:
	
One is running an influencer campaign for Ramadan (since dates are huge in that market).

Another is redoing our lifecycle marketing before I dump money into acquisition.

The third is handling accounting, which I should’ve outsourced sooner.

4. The competitive landscape has changed.
When the brand first launched, there were no competitors. Now, there are a lot more players in the space with one major one getting funding, and everyone is fighting for attention.

Our sustainability focus and unique flavors help us stand out, but it’s clear that I can’t rely on the product alone to win. I have to actively differentiate through storytelling, partnerships, and marketing.

Since we launched end of February, we’ve gotten about 3.5k in revenue. Not bad. 

The Road Ahead

I’m still figuring out retail, dialing in marketing, and working on making the unit economics work. But it’s been fun as hell.

He left his iPad on and went to bathroom with his phone to text her… with all the pinging it got my attention and I saw an actual live stream of the texts ending with her saying she wanted his dick. 

I was with him when he ran into her at a restaurant he owns. Just a month ago. She pounced on us and said didn’t we go to high school together?  We all did. And I noticed our old yearbook on his coffee table soon after. 

So golddigger obviously but there you go. 

Tosssed to the side like trash with him instantly desperate for attention.  It was so sudden and unexpected but I’m not the forgiving type; he first tried to bluster then seeing what I’d seen he shouted at me for looking at his iPad and said get out! I’d only been there 15 minutes.

I said this is over and tore off the necklace he’d given me for Christmas

So eight years over in a flash.


I had important work today and I’ve done less than half. I can’t concentrate and will now be up all night working to finish this by deadline.

I’m a nice person. I’ve been in four relationships over 6 years long. Every one cheated.  I’m considered pretty and I’m kind and patient.   Some woman always shows up and aggressively goes after my BFs and they being shitty lap it up.     

My kids dad had some other mom inviting him out constantly to go mountain biking. She invited “us” knowing that one of us had to stay home with my young kids…. and she’d pick a trail always that she knew was above my skill level.  That was my last cheating experience before this one.

1j5f29n,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAVegan/comments/1j5f29n/morality_of_veganism_and_donating/,Morality of veganism and donating,"I’ll start off by saying I think veganism is essentially the correct moral choice in terms of personal consumption.

However, I think a lot of the moral high ground occupied by vegans on this sub and others is on shakier grounds than they usually credit. 

If you’re a relatively well off person in the developed world, you can probably afford to be giving a greater share of your income to good causes, including reducing animal suffering. From a certain perspective, every dollar you spend unnecessarily is a deliberate choice not to donate to save human/animal lives. Is that $5 coffee really worth more to you than being able to stop chickens from being crammed into cages? 

This line of argumentation gets silly/sanctimonious fast, because we can’t all be expected to sacrifice infinitely even if it’s objectively the right thing. 

Is veganism really so different though? Is eating an animal product because you like the taste really that much worse than spending $20 on a frivolous purchase when you could very well donate it and save lives? It seems to come down to the omission/commission distinction, which if you subscribe to utilitarianism isn’t all that important. 

Ultimately, this is not an argument to not be vegan but I think vegans should consider the moral failings we all commit as average participants in society, and maybe tone down their rhetoric towards non-vegans in light of this.
