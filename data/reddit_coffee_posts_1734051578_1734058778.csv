1hd2ppj,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hd2ppj/need_help/,Need help,I'm considering buying an automatic machine for a Christmas gift and overwhelmed by options. I'd use it only for black coffee and my wife's lattes. Can anyone help me with buying advice? I don't need two hoppers and don't use syrups. I don't want to buy a machine that's more than what I need. Thanks! ,1,1734058679.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

And today it was very hard because i have my bf location on my iPhone and he knows that. And today he went to the supermarket and then went to the coffee shop and after he went to the coffee shop again and all of the sudden I noticed that he was coming from a small road that it’s  a little bit before the supermarket and he didn’t tell me anything about it. I got super anxious about it and when he arrived home I called him and tried to not think about it but then I panicked because he started talking about his day and  that he went to the supermarket and went to the coffee shop and I panicked because he didn’t mention going any other place. I was afraid of talking to him about it because I’ve been trying to trust him and not question anything and it would show that I didn’t trust him by seeing his location. When I talked about it he said that he went to the supermarket one second time but I said it didn’t make sense because the road that the locations showed me he was going is before the supermarket and the location showed me that he was moving, he was not static and he started saying that it was a bug and that he never went to that road and now I don’t know what to do anymore I want to trust him but the location says other thing. And he starts getting very frustrated and defensive because he says he didn’t went there and that is frustrating when you are saying the truth and the other person doesn’t believe it.
I’m really afraid that he is cheating on me again but this time it’s physically with someone.
He says that he feels like he needs to tell me about everything and that kinda feels like wearing a leash, and I said that I don’t like checking his location either and that I know it’s not healthy neither for me or for him or to the relationship and that I want to stop. And I even said that maybe it was better for me to take of his location from my phone because I’m always checking and he said that he doesn’t mind me having his location on my phone because it was him that gave it to me when we started dating so that I could check sometimes without getting worried and things like that. I want to trust him but it is so hard. It didn’t even pass a moth since I discovered everything. I’m feeling so anxious 
Can someone please give me an advice I don’t know what to do ",1,1734058653.0,cheating_stories,0,1.0,False
1hd2p24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1hd2p24/brain_fog_fatigue_insomnia/,"Brain fog, fatigue, insomnia","Is brain fog common among the high-IQ community? Or insomnia, which in turn causes fatigue and brain fog? I have struggled with insomnia for eons. It manifests either as an inability to fall asleep, or an inability to stay asleep, or it manifests itself as waking up far earlier than I'd like. Even when I do get 8-9 hours of sleep, it's sometimes fragmented or non-regenerative. Thus I find myself unable to read as much as I'd like or exploit my intellect as much as I'd like, as I'm always up against the gale headwinds of brain fog and fatigue. This also hampers my social life. I enjoy going out and meeting new and interesting people but I often find myself retreating because I'm too tired (and if I'm too tired, the only way for me to loosen up is by drinking alcohol).

The only things that have given me some measure of relief are melatonin and valerian root, and I've been taking the former for over ten years. I've cut most junk food from my diet, and I drink mostly water and coffee, and occasionally beer. And my coffee intake happens soon after I wake up - rarely do I drink coffee late in the day.

I also experience sensory overload at times, which in turn also short circuits my thinking process. Just the other night I was at that point in the day when my brain fog had kicked in, and I felt overloaded by the bright lights of the floor I was working on. A manager passed out a puzzle for us to solve to make time pass faster, and I said, ""I can't solve that right now because I'm not in the right headset."" LOL (I meant to say ""headspace"" not headset).

Anyway, any tips? Here's what I've tried throughout the years:

* Melatonin (helps somewhat)
* Valerian root (helps somewhat)
* Exercise (double-edged sword; when it helps, it helps wonderfully. Sometimes, however, it kills my sleep)
* L-Theanine (works sometimes when I take it with coffee)
* Meditation (has never worked)
* Eating healthfully (has helped somewhat)
* Consistent sleep schedule (this has helped me fall asleep faster, but has had little impact on my sleep duration)
* White noise (helps somewhat)",2,1734058622.0,Gifted,0,1.0,False
1hd2ou6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hd2ou6/aita_for_spilling_wine_on_my_sisters_dress_during/,AITA for spilling wine on my sisters dress during her wedding?,"Me (F23) and my sister Chloe (F25) have always been really close. We had a great childhood together and made a lot of fun memories together. Her now husband John (M26) proposed to her around February 2024. She was so excited and so was I. We went straight to dress shopping venue picking etc. (with our parents and her bridesmaids.) One day we met up for coffee and she LITERALLY told me to pay for her ENTIRE wedding. (Im pretty well of and very comfortable) I really said "" R u serious..?"" She really said ""Yes I am It would mean the world to me and John."" I felt really bad and did not want to let her down like that so I did. Stupid mistake. I agreed to help her. I paid *for everything that you can imagine venues, dresses, decorations EVERYTHING. Then one day in the bridesmaid group chat she told everyone to meet at her house for some drinks. Everyone got there and then announces her MOH. It was going to be her best friend. I was pretty shocked about the news considering the fact that I was paying for everything. But I stayed slient. Then we had a bachlorette party in Cancun Mexico and it was really fun. That trip is really not important in this story. Fast foward to the day before the wedding we were in the rehearsal. It was in a big ass mansion that our grandparents own. Everything went smooth until Chloe told our parents that she did not want to do the wedding in the mansion. Everyone was shocked by this news and confused. I quietly tell her that shes acting crazy and that the mansion was beautiful and that she should go through with wedding in the mansion. She refused. She shouted at me and said ""Look I dont care about your opinion this is my wedding Marie. This is why you are not my MOH."" Everyone stood silent and the rehersal was cut short. For context* we grew up in a very wealthy family and he have 2 older brothers Mike (M29) and Lionel (M28) They will be important later. Chloe couldnt care less about our grandparents while my brothers and I worshiped the ground they walked on, they are sacred to us. Now its the day of the wedding. The bridesmaids arrive and the MOH arrives. everyone gets the hair and makeup done and everything is going smoothly until Chloe comes storming in. I dont use this word often but she looks FURIOUS. She starts yelling at me because she did not like the flowers I picked out. (Keep in mind they were about 3,000 USD) I stand there but then I clapped back. ""You told me you wanted pink tulips and they look fantastic. How about you be a little more grateful and appreciate what you have."" She literally stood there crossing her arms and then SLAPPED me. I was about to pack up and leave until my mom walked in and stopped me. I explained the situation and she understood but she said after all it was my sisters wedding. So i stayed and then I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. Later the bridesmaids walk in and they let me vent to them. (I love them.) Soon the wedding started. The ceremony went on then the boring speeches, everyone starts crying blah blah blah. Here comes the good part. During the reception everyone was there. (200 ppl) I called my brothers and told them my plan to pour the wine on Chloe. They agreed. (They hate her too btw.) I walk over to her and ""Congratulate"" her on the wedding. Then my little nephew Matteo (Son of my brother Lionel.)  runs and pushes me and the glass of wine drips down my sisters dress. (the dress was sooo gorg it hurts to ruin a dress like that.) Everyone looks at me, Chloe and Matteo in shock. Long story short the wedding was cut 2 hours early because Chloe had a temper tantrum. Tbh I only feel bad for John in this. My family and I finally taught Chloe what karma is.

Had my second exam today. Torts. Came in feeling surprisingly confident. Decided to try this new Yemeni coffee shop in the morning. Got an iced white chocolate mocha. Worst mistake of my life.

I'll cut to the chase. 2 hours in, I completely defecated myself. I was time crunched and didn't want to waste 30 minutes in the bathroom and have my classmates think I was cheating and looking up answers.  I thought it was only a minor amount, but I sneakily checked by feeling inside my underwear. Hand was brown coming out. At this point, I didn't care anymore. I just wanted my stomach to stop hurting. I released it all and finished the exam. I'm still a bit confused on strict products liability, but I feel like I had most of the material on my outline.

I want to win her back,"Ok, let me preface this by saying this. I got out of a hectic long term relationship about a year ago that I was in for 4 years(one that went on and off and I had to eventually keep hidden from my family due to the toxicity on their part) and I worked heavily on myself before ever meeting this girl. I(M29) just recently went through a breakup with my(29F). Everything seemed perfect. I work nights so I decided to try the dating apps. We met through Hinge in early June(believe me I thought it wasn't gonna work either and just another girl who wanted to go on a few dates) and to my surprise we hit it off immediately. First date Jube 14th was awesome, it felt like meeting an old friend and we kissed by the end of the night(I don't usually do that on a first date). Moving forward we had a shit ton in common. We both love the outdoors, 80s music, camping, camper vans, cars, stupid things like PB sandwiches, honey, and wildlife. We went on a camping trip and stayed at an artistic town at an AirBnb and everything was amazing. Though relatively short(Dated 2.5 months before making things official, then official for 3.5) it was pretty awesome. I felt like I found the one. After the elections happened, I didn't vote(dont trust gov or politics being that I've worked for them 3 diff times) and I think it may have upset her or seen me in a different light. About 2 weeks after, she wanted to meet for coffee. Now, leading up to this day, I do believe that I myself wasn't necessarily being assertive during the entirety of the relationship. In the beginning I would always plan dates and times but as we got used to each other, I laid back a bit and became more of the ""if you'd like to do this, I'm totally down"" kind of person(learned behaviors from past relationships where if I didn't agree, there were problems)... personally, I can understand the political aspect, but I don't understand what else I did wrong. I was very chivalrous, constantly doing old school romantic shit that I was taught by my mother growing up, and this girl was always saying that she wanted someone romantic and do romantic gestures, even though now I think her perception of romance probably stemmed from dark romance books(you know the ones). Leading up to the break up, she wanted to get coffee(I knew I was screwed) and we talked as if normal just catching up on some things to which at one point I ask during a pause ""I feel like there's a negative connotation to this discussion""... she replies hesitantly with a yeah. Afterwards she goes and says that she thinks she's not meeting my expectations as a partner bc work was getting in the way for her. She then proceeds to say that she knows we're both emotionally and physically compatible, but she still feels like there's something missing and she doesnt think we are the people we are going to want years from now for each other. This breaks me bc I saw her as the one. I've experienced heartbreak before, but this was like my heart disintegrated completely. I don't know what happened. Maybe I bored her, or maybe I gave too much of the ""nice"" guy vibes(I hate being called that btw, it's not a term of endearment but rather a jab) or maybe I wasn't stepping up as a man. It's all very confusing to me and I'm tired of the dating scene due to low quality people nowadays. She was the last person I ever wanted to be in my life to conplete the story instead of becoming another chapter. For context, I have been with plenty of other women and dated 5 so I have experience in relationships. I did a lot during this one and put my full foot forward after failing in my past bc I knew this girl was different right off the bat.  Please help. I want to know how to navigate this and win her back but I'm so at a loss. I have been in no contact for about a month, and I want this person back in my life because she's the most amazing woman I have ever met. I told her I respected her decision, but I don't want to settle for less in this world and she's the only one I have eyes for, it's killing me inside.

I do not believe Patsy slept or was ever out of the clothes she wore on Christmas. I don’t believe she brushed her hair or redid her makeup before coming down ‘to make coffee.’

**Hi everyone, and welcome to the completely revisioned PC Parts Lists guide for the end of 2024 and early 2025!**

All lists have been remade from the ground up, as the market has been shifting and seeing new releases. I want to preface by saying that I will update the lists retroactively when new hardware will be released, such as the upcoming **Intel Arc B580** GPU, the **AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D** when it gets better stocked/priced, and of course the upcoming Nvidia RTX 5080/5090 when they get announced early January. I say ""I"", but I would like to announce that I've been getting help from frequent contributor of the subreddit: u/justaboss101.

# Before proceeding/commenting, please read the following:

* I have been getting a lot of comments of people being confused what the lists are actually for, and how the parametric selections work on [PCPartpicker.com](http://PCPartpicker.com) . Please use the [flowchart](https://imgur.com/a/LL98lVI) below to guide you through the website before commenting some frequently ask questions

https://preview.redd.it/dv74n5kmmi6e1.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c589dc181154ba9812e82aad468b1989bd90148

* I want to reiterate that these lists are here to give you an indication on what you can **expect** for a certain budget; what kind of **value** you can get for your money with that budget. That does not only mean pure performance, but also features, expandability, and future upgradability. Some of these are hard to quantify in words, but I have tried my best through my own judgment to make some weighted decisions on each list.
   * To give you an example, in the [$1200](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/4r9rmG) list I might recommend a Ryzen 7600(X) with an RTX 4070 Super, 32GB RAM, paired with a 1TB SSD, and a relatively value-oriented case, cooler & motherboard. This is my vision of the best 'value' PC you can get, but if you have a different PC with a high end case with RGB, expensive cooler, and 2TB SSD, that is 100%, utterly and completely, fine! I just want you to have a **reference point**.

Here are some of the major changes in this iteration of the PC Best Buy Guide compared to the [previous version](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1fkhpn1/autumn_2024_pc_best_buy_guide_300_6000/).

1. I have removed having multiple lists for a single pricepoint. This caused more confusion than clarity.
2. Reduced the budget threshold to where WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity is a requisite.
3. More AMD RX 6000 GPUs have been replaced by RX 7000 successors.
4. Started preferring Nvidia at the high end. With current pricing I think the 4070 Ti Super and 4080 Super offer a better package than the 7900XT and 7900XTX in my opinion. That being said, the 7900XT(X) are still great GPUs. AMD still offers the best value with the 7600, 7600XT, 7700XT, 7800XT, and 7900 GRE.
5. Due to the volatility of the Ryzen 7800X3D and 9800X3D CPU pricing, the 7700X and 9700X will often be used as substitutes in gaming PCs.
6. Due to the RTX 4090 now being almost completely out of stock or ridiculously expensive at $2300+ I've opted to leave out the mega expensive PC parts lists until the RTX 5080/5090 have released, and the 9800X3D has gone down in price.
7. Removed the NZXT themed build and many part selections due to ongoing consumer unfriendly practices.

# The Lists: Gaming PCs

|Budget|Note / compared to previous budget|Possible upgrades with leftover budget (in order of priority)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[\~ $400](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/rb4smG)|Uses the iGPU from the Ryzen 8600G. Has limited gaming performance, but is cheap, has a fast CPU, and is a great setup for a future GPU insert.|1TB SSD, higher end motherboard with wifi (from $900 list), better case|
|[\~ $500](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/jg6rmG)|The i3 12100F/13100F is outstanding value for around $75. Its performance is great, and paired with a value GPU like the Intel Arc A750 or AMD RX 6600(XT) this is a fantastic starting point to start getting into PCs. Besides the CPU and GPU, the PC is pretty barebones though.|Better motherboard with wifi, 1TB SSD, better case, upgrade GPU to 6600XT/6650XT|
|[\~ $600](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/xjzfhM)|With 20% or $100 more we can flesh out the build quite nicely. We upgrade to an i5, the RX 6600XT/6650XT/7600, a much better motherboard and a 1TB SSD.|32GB RAM, Wi-FI enabled motherbaord, Ryzen 7 5700X / i5 12600K, better case.|
|[\~ $700](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/xj8rmG)|Here I am including 32GB RAM, which is quite early into the lists. 16GB is getting tighter and tighter as we get newer games, and DDR4 RAM won't stay cheap forever. We also upgrade the GPU again to the 7600XT or Intel Arc B580 when it releases (or 6700XT / 6750XT).|Better power supply (from $900 list for example), wi-fi enabled motherboard|
|[\~ $800](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/N72m3C)|Here we upgrade the CPU to something a bit more capable with the i5 12600K paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a much quieter cooler compared to the included ones from before.|If you can find it, the Ryzen 5 7500F would be a great substitute. You also need a compatible AM5 motherboard.|
|[\~ $900](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/Ws6rmG)|From this point onward, AMD AM5 is almost always the way to go, as Intel simply doesn't have great competition against AMD currently besides the lower end. We're also greatly increasing the quality of the power supply.|Upgrade the GPU to the RX 7700XT, 2TB SSD, wi-fi enabled motherboard.|
|[\~ $1000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/6wMbwP)|Here I'm starting to be a bit more restrictive and specific on the motherboard. Besides that we're now always getting a PCIe Gen 4 SSD, faster RAM, and the Radeon RX 7700XT GPU.

The three of them caught an omnibus back to Eastern's apartment. Now that they knew that Houndstooth was the one going through their things their places weren’t off limits.

They fell into the apartment and Selkirk took up station on the couch, while Nick used the bathroom and then joined her. 

Once again she put her head on his lap and he started stroking between her ears. Eastern was in the kitchen rummaging in her refrigerator. “The cabinets are dangerously low on provisions, hons. Want takeout?""

Selkirk looked up from Nick's lap. ""I'm starving. I'll eat figuratively anything.""

Nick nodded. ""It's been a day. Let's get something delivered."" 

Eastern brought her pad over to the couch and flopped down, leaning her back against Nick's side. She went through the options of restaurants who will deliver to her place. In a fit of... nostalgia? Nick recommended Parvatian food. Eastern was interested, and the place nearest to them had things Selkirk could eat. When the food arrived, Nick was immediately transported back to his childhood. The smells, the flavors, it all reminded him of being back home and getting takeout with his parents after they had a long day at work and didn’t want to cook. Nick got Parvatian food rarely after moving to Hyacinth. At first, he wanted to cut himself off from his old life and start everything new. Eventually it would just remind him of his parents. Nick wondered if finally enough time has passed that his memories of them were comforting rather than depressing. Maybe the fact that he could share it with friends now helped.

Eastern and Selkirk had never had Parvatian before and while it was all food she could eat, Selkirk declared the spices too unfamiliar and stuck with the naan. Eastern was intrigued though and would try the different combinations that Nick would recommend. 

After dinner, they all sat together on Eastern’s couch in her tiny apartment. Eastern stretched and looked at both of them. “Now that we’ve eaten, we should think about next steps. Do we have any leads at all on Yon?”

Nick shook his head. “I don’t have any. I wouldn’t know the first place to begin looking for a missing AI.”

Selkirk smiled and flicked her ears. “I swear, it’s like you two have never done anything more advanced than boost trinkets before.”

Nick raised an eyebrow. “I mean, I haven’t really. Boost small things, poach some apps or softs from unsecured servers, a bit of light smash and grab.”

Eastern chuckled. “Okay then, Selkirk - kingpin of Hyacinth - what do we do next.”

Selkirk grinned wickedly at them. “The *first* thing we do is go to the bedroom. The second thing we do is have an enjoyable time learning about each other and what their likes in the bedroom are. The third thing we do is have a wild evening exploring those likes. The fourth thing we do is fall asleep in a pile, blissfully spent. The **fifth** thing we do is trust Kingpin Selkirk and she’ll show you the way in the morning.

A few hours later, Nick realized Selkirk was right. She had it all planned out and it went exactly according to plan.

The morning found them sprawled out on Eastern’s bed, naked in a pile. They got up, made coffee and this time Nick recommended just some pastries as they walked.

Eastern ate her pastry in record time, and she tossed the paper into a trash receptacle without even stopping. “Okay Selkirk, other than Nick’s idea for coffee and pastries, we’ve been following your plan and you haven’t lead us wrong yet.” She reached over and - lightning quick - pinched her rear next to her tail. “What’s next?”

Selkirk jumped at the touch and grinned at Eastern. “Next, we’re going to the Basement.”

“The Basement?” Nick could hear Sel pronounce the proper noun. He looked at Selkirk as they were walking. “I didn’t think where were basements on Hyacinth.”

Selkirk winked, her face naturally mimicking the human gesture.. “You just don’t know where to look. Follow me.”

Eastern and Nick followed her as she took them further up-arm. They caught a Metro and rode up to Peony square. This far north, it was mostly commuters going further down-arm towards the more built up areas near the base to their office jobs. Arriving at Peony square station, they follow the light crowds out of the metro car. 

Selkirk held them back on the platform as the morning commute crowds flowed down the stairs towards the the next train. When the crowds were mostly gone, Selkirk dashed towards the rear of the station. With a glance back to make sure that Eastern and Nick were following her, she slapped her palm against a reader that Nick could have sworn wasn’t there earlier and a door slid open. 

“Come on, let’s go, we gotta ghost before the next train comes!” Eastern and Nick ducked through the doorway and it slamed shut behind them.

They were in a hall. It looked like any other maintenance tunnel that Nick had seen in his time on Hyacinth. Selkirk led them confidently down the tunnel until they reach another anonymous door. The only sign that anything was different with this door than any of the dozens of other doors in the hall was a small sticker at K’laxi level. It was a stylized flower - a cartoon of a hyacinth actually. Again she palmed the reader and again the door hissed open. “Come on, couple more levels to go.” Nick and Eastern followed silently.

It’s not like the buildings and streets were sitting on the hull of Hyacinth. If they were, there would be no place for the power lines, the sewer pipes, the water supply; all of the circulation, the veins, neurons and organs of civilization. On planets, it’s under the ground, on stations and starbases it’s usually in the walls or the ceiling. 

On Hyacinth, it’s in The Basement. 

The Basement was what everyone called the maintenance tunnels and access halls below the ground floor. Most of the time, only Houndstooth maintenance techs and city workers were going to be down there. This meant that there would be long stretches of Basement that would go potentially *years* before someone who was supposed to be there would show up.

It was inevitable that someone was going to find and use this otherwise underutilized space.

Hyacinth was big, but it wasn’t so big that people didn’t need a place to hide and do business out of the prying eyes of Houndstooth authorities. After going down another set of stairs, Nick looked around. Now, the walls here were unpainted panels clipped and bolted together and the signs became much more encoded. He’d see things like SECTOR X-45 RIGHT SPINWARD DEP COMP on a dusty label and realized that they were in a part of Hyacinth that was rarely officially seen. Other than people going where Selkirk was taking them, the number of… *official* visitors was probably in the single digits in the last century.

Finally, they reach a door and Selkirk stopped. She looked back at them, her eyes bright. “Look. I trust you, otherwise I wouldn’t be in a relationship with you, and I wouldn’t have taken you here. But, I need to make sure you’re ready to trust me.” Her ears twitched. “Things might get… weird.”

Nick blinked. “Of course I trust you Sel.”

Eastern agreed. “Implicitly.”

Selkirk’s ears twitched again and she smiled. “Thanks. I knew it, but I needed you to say it before we go any further. This part of the Basement has a lot of K’laxi and… you might get a bit of the furry eyeball. Just remember, you’re with me, I trust you, you trust me and if things go sideways, I’ll let you know. Selkirk nodded half to herself once. “Good.”

Eastern and Nick looked at each other for a split second, then back at Selkirk. They were going somewhere that wasn’t theirs, they’d do well to listen to someone that knew more about where they were going. Sel took a breath, held it a moment, and then let it out slowly. She palmed the last door and it hissed open.

Nick’s senses were *assaulted*. It was noisy, it smelled of spices that he had no names for, and of countless people. Eastern grinned widely as she took it all in. “Now this? This feels like home. I like it” Luna was even older than Hyacinth and had always trended towards small, crowded spaces.  Nick, having grown up on Parvati which had plenty of room did *not* like crowded spaces and tried not to wince, then followed Selkirk. 

It was so crowded. They were walking down what was clearly an old, wide hallway, but it had been set up with stalls and booths of people selling things. Food, goods, information. Nick looked around; it seemed like people were selling everything. 

There were more K’laxi here than Nick had ever seen. There were a decent number of K’laxi on Hyacinth but it felt like they were *all* here, right now.

Selkirk was in her element. Immediately after she walks in she starts waving and shouting to people who recognize her and the business of business begins. Eastern and Nick could only watch and follow her as she made her way down the hall, using her tail and her ears and her hands to gesture while she spoke, using a patois that neither of them could even hope to replicate.

 

Before too long, a fried treat on a stick was pressed into Nick’s hand and a hot drink into Eastern’s.  Nick took a bite. It was hot and crispy and fried and delicious. He handed it over to Eastern and she took a big bite too. “This is amazing!” Eastern said around the mouthful of food. “Here Nick, try my drink.” She hands it over to him and he takes a sip. It’s hot and woodsy and probably a kind of tea. He’s never had the specific flavor combination before but it’s nice. It’s a good compliment to the fried treat on a stick.

Selkirk grinned as she continues to work the crowd. “I thought you’d like that. They-“ She gestures with her tail to a stall behind them “-were trying to ingratiate themselves to me and try and wrangle a discount with someone I know.”

Nick took another bite. “Did it work?”

She chuckled. “A bit yeah, but probably not as much as they are hoping.”

Eastern took another sip of the tea. “Did you find out anything?”

She nodded. “Yeah, I have a lead. We’re headed to talk to them now.”

Selkirk led them further down the hall and they came to an intersection. Nick was amazed at how large The Basement really was. “Sel, does The Basement run the length of Hyacinth?”

“Sort of. There are a bunch of *different* Basements all across Hyacinth. If it was all one continuous place it would have been found out and cleared out long ago. As it is, they get raided pretty regularly, especially the ones down-arm. This one is relatively new, so we’re hopeful it’ll be around a while. Come on, it’s this way.” Selkirk looked at the intersection and turned left.

As they walked further into the basement, things got less rowdy and quieter. The shops changed from people selling food and merchandise to what looks to Nick to be like meeting rooms and offices. Some were even behind former mechanical room doors.

After another few turns and they were deep into The Basement. They got to a plain looking door, clearly a repurposed maintenance door. Selkirk walked up to it and made another complicated gesture with her hands, ears and tail and they heard the click of a speaker.

“Yes?”

“Ral said you’d be able to help us with our problem.”

“Did they now?”

“Yes, they also said you can use this to get half off next month’s payment to them.”

After a pause, Nick heard the click of a lock. Selkirk touched the pad next to the door and it hissed open. 

The three of them stepped inside and… it’s an office.

Just an office. Anonymous art on the walls, indirect calm lighting overhead, chairs that look comfortable but aren’t.

An office.

Sitting at a simple metal desk was a woman-shaped person. She seemed older than Nick and Eastern, maybe late 30s or early 40s. She had brown hair in a tight bun tied up with a chopstick, and was reading a pad. She looked up at the three of them. 

“I confirmed with Ral what he’s offering and what they said you need. I’m willing to *listen* but I will make no guarantees about being able to help.” She put down the pad. “My name is - or rather was - *Sunny Day*, but you can call me Sunny.”",1,1734057957.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

No one is making plans except me 🙄,"I have a 2 year old and an almost 3-month old baby. In the past my family went to my parents house for a typical big Christmas Eve celebration. Over the last few years my parents and I have basically parted ways. It’s probably not reconcilable, and definitely not by Christmas. 

My in-laws are..meh. FIL is a typical hyper-masculine man whose family is afraid of him. I’m the only one who has stood up to him (when he was holding onto my son and wouldn’t let him go and my son started to scream.. forcing him to sit in the kiddie pool when he wanted to stand and get out..) and my husband has started to as well. MIL just has a loooot of unsolicited advice and demands her gifts to be used in front of her otherwise she gets mean, it’s stuff like that that I can ignore but it’s exhausting because I feel like I’m parenting my husbands parents. Them and my husbands grandmas are first gen immigrants from Eastern Europe and they all cook 90% of their meals and takeout is basically shocking to them (significant for later). 

None of them have initiated holiday plans and I know they’re going to try and set something up last minute. For thanksgiving I planned to have them over but they went on vacation instead. I’m trying to plan something now for them (husbands parents and 3 grandmas so 7 total including my husband and I). 

They all live 1.5 hours from us and my husband refuses to drive there with our toddler to celebrate the holiday. He says it would be weird to be without me and is worried I’ll get upset that he left me during the holidays (btw we’re talking 12/21 or 1/4). 

I don’t feel up for hosting a meal. I’m 11 weeks postpartum and while I have the house and capacity to do it, I just don’t want to. I’m tired. Baby still wakes up 2-3x/night. I’m just starting to get over severe PPD that almost put me in the hospital less than a month ago.

I offered to my husband to meet his family halfway for a nice restaurant meal at a fancy hotel nearby so we could do a gift exchange in the big lounge area and have dinner together. I sent him a list of 5 options in different cute little towns between us and them. One even had a children’s musical option. He didn’t like any of those. He countered with saying just his parents can meet him at a local arboretum for a walk and meal. Well, it’s winter and about 20-30 degrees out so that’s just not a good idea. Plus, his grandmas wouldn’t go to that and part of the reason for gathering is for them to meet our new baby who is actually named after one of them. 

So finally I said how about they come to our town for brunch, we go back to our house so toddler can nap, during toddlers nap we all watch a Russian Christmas movie (they’re Russian) and when he wakes up we’ll do presents and pizza. We did a pizza party over the summer and the grandmas loved it. But then my husband said well if it’s a holiday celebration they’ll want to bring food. But the idea of 4 older women bringing armfuls of food to my house is too much for me. I’d have to clear my refrigerator, set the table respectfully since they took the time to cook all of this, use good plates, wine glasses, all the stuff, manage the meal and make sure everyone has food, drinks, water, etc., also manage my 2 month old and feed him, let people hold him if they appear not sick, clean after the meal, get out desserts and all the plates and coffee and cups that go with it, clean again, etc. 

I’m sure you guys can understand there is a difference between a fun casual pizza holiday party and hosting a legitimate holiday meal. Going to a restaurant for brunch is supposed to be instead of a nice meal at home. But now I’m supposed to do both? 

Should I just suck it up and host this meal? The grandmas are 90 and who knows how many more holidays we’ll have together. An important note is they’re going to have their own legitimate new years meal together on 1/1 with all the special foods so it’s not like if we don’t do it at my house they won’t do it at all.

1hd2fki,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1hd2fki/seline_was_fantastic/,Seline was fantastic ,"Seline recently opened in Santa Monica and is David Beran’s newest restaurant. 

TL;DR up front: It’s absolutely amazing, and I highly recommend going. The food is incredible, the hospitality is as gracious, and the ambiance is a delight. Going as a single diner was worth it, and the staff made it so I never felt lonely. The nonalcoholic pairing was well worth it too. 

Please don’t read descriptions if you want to be surprised when you go. It’s worth going in at least a little blind.

More details:

Seline’s ambiance separates itself from busy Santa Monica to create a serene and elegant environment. The dining room blends with the kitchen, so it’s more than just an open concept and becomes a seamless unit, like eating at a really chic friend’s house. The cookbook library next to the kitchen completes the homey look, but the books are all tomes of culinary cuisine and the art on the walls reminds you that this is still a serious restaurant worthy of acclaim.

That acclaim is earned by both the food and the hospitality.

First up was a warm mushroom soup, tinted with vanilla and seaweed. Started off with a total homerun, this was the perfect opening taste. With a deep mushroom umami, punctuated by warm vanilla and saline vibes, this combined the comforts of a hearty homey stew with the depth of a good dashi and the childlike memory of hot chocolate. Perfect on a (relatively) cold night. It really combined the best of a warm udon soup, an Irish stew, and hot chocolate. Hits the tastebuds from all directions.

Next came the first in the nonalcoholic pairing: a pear cider with pine. This was light and refreshing. On its own it was nice but it paired really well with the coming courses.

Next course was a matsutake chawanmushi, trout roe with beech mushrooms, and smoked trout. This was tasty with balanced smokiness and brininess. While good, this was the least favorite of mine on the menu, but it was still very nice. 

Up third was the climax of the mushroom progression: grilled maitake with smoked date puree and lapsang souchong bbq sauce and marjoram. This fucking slapped. Perfect texture on the mushrooms and excellent balance of flavor and texture. Could have stopped here and left happy. The smoke just played perfectly with the grilled mushroom and sweet dates. Like if a forest wizard made an edible campfire. 

Next drink was a cucumber juice with coriander, this was a step up in flavor intensity while still being fresh and cleansing, with a solid spice on the finish.

Braised leeks with banana and fennel puree came with a side of an herbed cracker. This was another total banger. Would never have thought to pair banana with leeks and fennel but it just worked. Very savory and bright but still autumnal. Cracker was crispy and fresh with ice plant, nasturtium, and other herbs. Like walking through a California seaside meadow.

A little dessert came next with malted chestnut and wood sorrel. This midway dessert had great malt flavor punctuated by zippy wood sorrel. Texturally pleasing and a welcome change up from all the savory dishes.

The next drink was a rooibos tea with aged vinegars. This was a melody of flavors, more complex than most fine wines. The vinegars lent a depth of flavor to the rooibos. Had a nice umami to it and some sherry like funk.

A squash was presented with various alliums and greens removed onto a plate. The greens had been steamed in the baked squash, lending them a light squash aroma. This ate like a comforting green bean casserole (complete with fried onions) that had been bombarded with a dozen other flavors. Great example of exciting comfort.

The grilled sea bass with ice plant and squash seed was another total homerun. The seaweed looking thing had a toothsome texture that was akin to al dente pasta with some of the chewiness of a mochi, all with deep kelp flavor. The seed sauce had me licking the plate. 

Next came the squash that had been used to cook the salad, gussied up with apple puree, brown butter, black truffle, and sage. Familiar flavors done perfectly. Great balance of tastes so nothing dominated but all elevated. Amazing textures too.

A hibiscus “wine” had the complexity of a nice Syrah, with full tannins and infused spices to give it real zing.

The “obvious” parts of the squab included perfectly cooked breast with sausage stuffed leg, cauliflower puree, fennel puree, currants, and roasted cauliflower. This was a well balanced and tasty meat course. Paired well the hibiscus wine. The sauce was delicious. Not the most exciting course but nice to have something filling with flawless technique. The sausage stuffed leg was especially impressive.

The nonobvious parts of the squab was possibly the most exciting course. Comprised of a cocoa encased liver, hazelnut butter sandwiched in between crispy squab skin, and heart reduction with strawberry covering infused custard, this course sounded like it would be offal dominant but everything just worked. Really roasted that sweet and savory line. The custard ate like caramel flan but with perfectly blended strawberry and squab heart as the caramel. The cocoa liver was probably the most classic combination but worked texturally better than most. The hazelnut bittersweet sandwich was just so pleasing. Great trio that really flexed technique and balance of flavors.

First dessert drink was a banana milk flip (not pictured). This was a tasty banana drink that was straightforward and yummy.

Caviar and coffee was a triumph. The coffee anglaise was perfectly bitter and smooth and paired seamlessly with the caviar. Hazelnut crumble completed the dish. Makes you wonder why coffee and caviar isn’t done more often.

Fig leaf cream with hachiya persimmon and black sesame crumble is in my top three desserts of 2024. It has the nutty and sweet combo like a peanut butter and jelly with the gritty and smooth textures of a perfect parfait. I almost asked for another one, but I was almost full to bursting. 

Final drink was possibly the best: a nonalcoholic Sauternes. Caramelized honey with some saffron, bay leaf, white pepper, and chamomile, this actually tasted like a good Sauternes. Not too sweet and floral with some mild spice and depth of flavor. Hope this stays on the drink menu. It’s awesome.

Next came a contrast in texture and temperature and the most overtly technical dessert. Nitrogen frozen maple syrup with tobacco biscuit crumble served with warm parsnip puree. This was so so so good. Texture and temperature contrast with both familiar and unfamiliar flavors that just worked. 

Final send off mirrored the first taste: another cup of liquid. This was a bracingly cold herbal infusion of mint, eucalyptus, rosemary, and bay leaf. Sweet and with a weighty texture, this tasted like breathing in cold air after chewing mint gum. Very refreshing and like the first winter morning.

This whole menu was art in addition to flavor. It mirrored the progression of autumn to winter, focused on both the time (late fall) and place (Southern California) from a chef who grew up in the Midwest. The flavors bridged familiar with exotic, using ingredients mainly found in Southern California. Time and again I was reminded of hikes along the beach or through a chaparral covered forest. The level of detail in both the food and the restaurant itself made it an experience worth a visit. 

The staff were also extremely gracious and welcoming. Everyone was kind and knowledgeable. Yes, my napkin was folded after my return from the bathroom but also everyone was genuinely excited and helpful. No pretense at all. Even as a solo diner, I never felt bored or lonely, and everyone readily nerded out about both the food and the environment.

While Seline is still new and we’ll have to see about its consistency, and it’s hard to divine what Michelin ever thinks, and it’s 100% true that Michelin is not the ultimate benchmark of restaurant quality, this definitely felt like at least a two Michelin star meal. It was better thought out conceptually and tasted better than most of the two stars I’ve been to and better than any one star. Accolades aside, this is one of the few tasting menus I’m hell bent on returning to in seasons to come. Really hope they continue this energy in the years to come.",4,1734057782.0,FoodLosAngeles,0,1.0,False

Only one local coffee shop in my area sells coffee beans and they only have 2 types. I found one with good reviews that's about 100km away has CAD36.00 shipping fee lmao, even more expensive than those coming from other provinces.

I would say I can finish a bag (340g) in about 3 weeks to 4 weeks. I mostly just use for espresso and there's coffee in the office so I don't go through that much coffee beans. Should I buy two bags to save on shipping or would the coffee be stale by the end?",1,1734057580.0,espresso,3,0.67,False

Chapter 22:

“Derrick.” Unit’s voice, a smooth baritone with a hint of a familiar Midwestern drawl, resonated through the spacious captain’s quarters. “I have acquired some information that may be of considerable interest.”

A low groan rumbled in my chest. The warm embrace of sleep, a rare and precious commodity these days, was ripped away like a cheap blanket. “What is it, Unit?” I mumbled, my voice thick with sleep. “Can’t it wait?” I burrowed deeper into the plush silk bedding, trying to recapture the fleeting remnants of a dream I couldn't quite recall.

“I believe I have pinpointed the location of your home system, Sol.” There was a pause, a subtle shift in Unit’s tone that hinted at something… more. A hesitation I hadn’t heard before.

“Sol?” It took a minute. It really shouldn't have honestly. “Oh! The Solar system. Of course.” Dumbass. “Yeah. Alright! Let's go. Heh. I bet we could conquer the world with this ship. Hell, maybe even the old one. Not that I'd want to. Just… You know.” I glanced down at the ring on my finger, its surface dulled with scratches and grime. I’d have to polish it up before I saw my wife. She’d kill me if I messed up my ring. Again.

“Derrick. There's something you should know-” I cut Unit off.

“No time for chit-chat, Unit. I'm craving a goddamn coke and some instant noodles. Maybe a coffee. And McDonald’s. Oh, and Taco Bell. Definitely Taco Bell.” I could practically taste the industrial plastic cheese already. My stomach rumbled in agreement. “Set a course, Unit. Let’s get this show on the road.”

I was already out of bed, stretching and popping my back like a rusty hinge. “You've got me all riled up.” I chuckled, stretching my legs. “I'll go jog down to Vorak and tell him the news myself.”

It took a minute, but I made my way down to the workshop where Vorak was working. I waited for the sliding door to open. It's kinda hard to burst into a room when the ship only had sliding doors. He seemed to be working on deconstructing the neutron lance. The ruby I grabbed was sitting next to a deconstructed shield generator.

“Working hard I see.” I panted, out of breath. “We found my home system.”

“We did?” Vorak paused in his tinkering, clearly thinking to himself.

“Yeah. Well, at least Unit did.” I was gitty. Oh yeah, of course I was. I could go home and see my wife. She'd probably be pissed but hey, it's only been a month. I think Vorak would like her. She's smart. Smarter than me at least.

“Right.” Vorak's eyes squinted slightly. “Human Derrick, if you don't mind, I would appreciate some privacy. I have to… Focus.” There was some hesitation.

Vorak’s hesitation wasn’t lost on me, but I chalked it up to his usual meticulous nature. He was always a little cagey when deep into a project. I gave him a quick thumbs-up and turned to leave. “Alright man, kick some ass and don't get your ass kicked.”

I jogged out of Vorak's workshop, the door sliding shut behind me with a soft hiss. Something about his tone nagged at the back of my mind, but I pushed it aside. Vorak was always weirdly intense when he was working on something big. Probably trying to figure out how to reverse-engineer that neutron lance we picked up. No big deal. My focus was on getting home.

""Unit,"" I said, my voice echoing down the corridor as I made my way back to the cockpit, ""how long until the skip drive's ready for another jump? Think we can shave off some of that recharge time?”

""Negative, Captain,"" Unit replied. ""The recharge cycle for the skip drive is fixed due to energy constraints. Any attempt to accelerate the process would risk a catastrophic failure.""

""Yeah, yeah, fine,"" I muttered, waving a hand dismissively as if Unit could see me. ""Just let me know the second we can jump again. I’m itching to taste some homemade Mac and cheese.” Seriously. I'm so sick and tired of that nutrient paste. It gets worse and worse by the day.

“Affirmative, Captain,” Unit replied, its voice as smooth and reassuring as a glass of warm milk. “I will alert you the moment the skip drive is fully charged.”

I grinned, feeling a surge of anticipation. Home. It was a word that had echoed in my thoughts, a distant dream for what felt like an eternity. But now, it was within reach. Just a few more hours, and I’d be back on Earth, back in the arms of my wife, back to a life that felt both so close yet impossibly far.

“You know,” I said, settling back into the captain’s chair, a much more comfortable design that made our old ship’s floor seem like a medieval torture device, “this whole space pirate thing… It’s not so bad.  A little chaotic, sure, dangerous of course. Really dangerous actually. But hey, who needs a nine-to-five when you can steal spaceships and explore the galaxy?” I chuckled, feeling a surge of exhilaration. I’d faced down giant spiders, looted tomb worlds, and even managed to survive a botched brain surgery… Well, two actually. What was a little intergalactic travel compared to that?

Still, it'd be best to start learning the ins and outs of our ship’s operating system while I have time. Luckily, Unit has my back. “Say, Unit. Are you sure you didn't translate everything to English?”

“I'm positive. The language is still in Glargonian. There's been no changes in the display.” Unit replied.

“Huh. Yeah, I thought so. It felt familiar.” I replied, popping my neck. “I think those Nanomachines in my bloodstream rebuilt the Universal translator. Maybe. Or they're doing something like that anyway.”

I leaned back in the captain’s chair, letting the thought of the translator work itself out. It made sense. Whatever those nanomachines were doing, they seemed to be keeping me alive and adapting to me and my environment.

“Unit,” I said, rubbing my temples, “add ‘nanomachines’ to the growing list of things I don’t understand about my body but probably should figure out.”

Unit ignored that.

""Unit,"" I asked, staring out at the vast expanse of space, ""those nanomachines in me… Any chance they could have tapped into the ship’s systems? Maybe translated the schematics directly to my neural interface or something?""

""Such an interaction is implausible, Captain,"" Unit replied. ""The nanomachines in your system are powered by your body heat and the range of their radio wave signals would be too short to reliably contact any outside sources.”


//Note from Vorak: I spoke to Unit about Derrick's home world. I personally don't know Derrick well enough to know how he'd respond to learning such a thing. Our alliance could break if I inform him personally. That would be impractical to say the least. His species appears to be more emotionally intelligent than my own. I believe he'd either collapse into a depression or a rage beyond what I've seen… I haven't known Derrick long, however, I trust his judgement. It would be a problem if it were compromised.

Derrick did not wish to speak about what happened the following day. He stated “It brought back too many bad memories.” Therefore I shall continue in his stead. Utilizing the skip drive, traversal to the Sol system was achieved. Derrick's enthusiasm remained consistent with previous observations. The system's planetary configuration presents an anomaly: four gaseous giants situated externally, with four solid planets orbiting internally. Standard planetary formation models suggest internal planets within such systems possess excessive mass, thus precluding the development of substantial multicellular life. However, preliminary scans indicate the presence of three planets within Sol's habitable zone. Based on data provided by Derrick, the target planet designated ""Earth"" is situated third from the star.

Arriving at Earth presented minimal navigational challenges. Its proximity to the fourth planet, coupled with orbital alignment, facilitated a swift approach. My optical acuity, surpassing that of Derrick, allowed for immediate observation of the planet's state. The visual data acquired was… distressing. Earth's atmosphere presented a dense, opaque grey hue, obscuring surface details. Upon closer inspection, the planet resolved into a swirling marble of white and grey, suggestive of extensive cloud cover. Atmospheric analysis confirmed the presence of substantial particulate matter, consistent with soot and water vapor. This deviated significantly from Derrick’s descriptions of a vibrant, blue-green world. I have observed its appearance in the media stored on Derrick’s personal device, and I conclude that Earth’s biosphere has collapsed. As assumed, the Archopodes have turned Earth into a Plague World.

Derrick’s reaction was… anomalous. Contrary to predicted emotional outbursts, characterized by either depressive withdrawal or aggressive displays, he exhibited an atypical stoicism. His customary levity and sardonic humor were notably absent, replaced by an unsettling quietude. He remained motionless for a prolonged interval, his gaze fixed on the viewport displaying the desolate vista of his homeworld. His facial musculature contracted slightly, forming vertical furrows above his optical organs. After a protracted silence, he vocalized a single, chilling declaration: “This means war.” Derrick had clearly inferred exactly who was responsible.

He then proceeded to egress the ship’s cockpit, his gait atypically rigid. Unit, via internal communication channels, subsequently informed me of Derrick's activities within the designated captain's quarters. Acoustic analysis suggested percussive impacts against the vessel's interior bulkheads, consistent with the application of substantial kinetic force. Unit further reported visual confirmation of epidermal lacerations on Derrick's metacarpophalangeal joints, presumably resulting from said impacts. This behavior, while not entirely unanticipated given the circumstances, deviated significantly from established human behavioral baselines in response to emotional distress. Hypotheses regarding the underlying cause of this atypical reaction include, but are not limited to: suppressed emotional response, atypical neurological processing, or the potential influence of the previously documented nanomachinery within Derrick's physiology. Further observation and analysis are required to ascertain the precise causative factors.

She and I did everything together and she was one of the first people I genuinely felt pure friendship from. We read the same books and would talk about them all the time, and she even made me a necklace inspired by one of the books, which I still wear. Our friendship really meant a lot to me. But in high school I came out as gay and openly drank coffee and she just stopped talking to me. I had so many classes with her and she didn’t talk to me once after I came out. I was so lonely in high school because she and my entire friend group abandoned me when I came out. I know how she treated me was shitty, just because I was leaving the faith and gay. But I still think about her, and how life would have been different had we stayed friends. It’s one of the main things that hurts, years after I left. The church instilled so much prejudice into my dear friend, that she would rather abandon our friendship than seek to understand. I know she doesn’t want to be friends anymore. She made that abundantly clear in high school. But damn it still hurts, all these years later. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest in a community of people who understand. The church took my best friends away from me, and it still hurts, and right now I’m really mourning that loss. ",2,1734057412.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

Cramps, loose stool, foul smelling stool, daily stomach aches, constipation and incomplete bowels, weird noises all hours of the day coming from my stomach and light colored stool. My blood work came back perfect, stool exams came back good, no parasites etc. fast forward to now, most symptoms have disappeared… however, I’m left with bloating, incomplete evacuation, trapped gas in rectum sometimes and back pain? I have a breath test from triosmart on the way cause i suspect Sibo. Also, i now get bloated after Coffee!! Wtf . I love coffee :( .. what do you guys think? ",2,1734056589.0,SIBO,2,1.0,False

1hd1zth,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hd1zth,Parsnip cake! It,"I’ve been dreaming up a parsnip cake for a while now and finally made one for Friendsgiving. It was super yummy but I feel the parsnips didn’t shine thru as I wanted them too. Lots of spices in here(also used some special spice blends that included coffee and cocoa)made a lil walnut dukkah, clementine marmalade and buttery caramelized raisins for garniture. I attempted a persimmon jam for the filling but I walked away from it and let it burrrrrn :-( 

Overall I was happy with it and it had great depth of flavor plus it looked sooo cuteeee! 


For next time I will definitely not burn the persimmon jam. I will either make a sweet parsnip puree for layering or perhaps find away to incorporate parsnip into the frosting!

1hd1zsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1hd1zsy/sleeping_in_denied/,Sleeping in denied?,"Okay, so.. . A little back story.. I'm (40-ish m) working 75+ hours a week between two jobs to support my family of 9. Yes, 9. 7 children, 2 adults. Yes, it's a large family. ""Blended"" i should say. The father of 5 of the children got off scott free without having to pay a single dime in child support. 

So that leaves me being the only ""bread winner"" of the house. I work 2 pretty physically demanding jobs and bring home alright money. But... I'm ALWAYS exhausted.  Tired, in pain, stressed and I usually get 3-5 hours of sleep per evening due to either the chaos of the home, or because of my double job days. 14-18 hours. 

Anyways, i finally get a Saturday off from job #1 and I openly admit to my better half (40-ish f) that I'd rather enjoy sleeping in on Saturday due to not having to work. 

The response that was given? ""Nah, I've got to much to do, you can sleep in Sunday,  until like, 9am.""

I immediately went from being excited about sleeping,  to resentment.  

This is just one example of the stuff that I deal with on a daily basis. Every conversation must end with either her being right, or me being 100% wrong. 

The other say I was instructed how to make my coffee.. that I've been making, every morning,  on my own, for 20+ years. 

I'm rambling now. Anyways, I just wanted to vent. All I want is sleep. 😮‍💨",8,1734056401.0,Manipulation,6,1.0,False

I typically buy it at Target or Whole Foods. For the first time, I ordered it from Fred Meyers via Instacart. I didn't like it one bit. Since I had just returned from a many week vacation, I thought my taste buds need to re-adjust to milk in the US. The coffee I tasted now with the last bit of that milk, one week after my vacation, still tasted like that of a cheap 1% store-brand milk. I again attributed it all to my post-vacation taste buds, old coffee and everything else. 

But while throwing away the jug, I noticed that the label and the jug's opaqueness are different. Look at the image. What do you guys think? Do they--label and jug--look different to you (I will anyway check with a new usual jug tomorrow and update)? Is Organic Valley milk different in different stores? Or is it a counterfeit Organic Valley?

I’ve been smoking pot for over 10 years, mc for a few years now. Daily morning to night. As of 6 months ago I stopped my morning doses and only medicate from after 12pm. This is to help with negative side effects. However my dizziness is not going away. Particularly after some work or when I’m tired, I feel very dizzy, out of it, foggy and uncoordinated. Very much similar to being a little drunk, but not in a good mood. I think I even look a bit drunk being so uncoordinated. 
The feeling is very much like a zombie. 
I already drink lots of coffee, and no amounts of coffee help with this. Sometimes I’m so zombie that I just need to sleep. 
Would appreciate hearing if anyone else has similar reactions or advice on what to do.

So, I was in a pinch and wanted to get a quick and dirty test under my belt. This was about as quick and dirty as it can get. 

I used a laptop, streaming a song, LFE feed was a 3.5mm jack audio out splitter (split from my computer speaker feed) and this splitter converted into a pair of RCA cables which fed into an inexpensive Fosi  TP-02 subwoofer amp that then terminated in the enclosure. This was all tested while on a 30 year old rickety, metal cart on wobbly wheels. 

See? That’s about as dirty as it gets. Haha. 

Since many people were asking about whether or not a DOS setup cancels out excessive vibrations, I put a coffee mug on top so you could see the activity. 

I was blown away with how rich the sound was. I can’t wait until I find my REAL sub amp and get it set up properly. 

I did notice some air leaks from some seams, so I will be opening it up and using epoxy on every single seam in about a week or so. 

Overall, I am super happy!!

Here’s the specs on the speakers: https://www.retailspecs.com/files/pdf/attachment/71102/Data_Sheet.pdf

And since I am trying to do this all on a budget for my Home Theater, I am thinking about this amp: https://a.co/d/43IRou4 or this one: https://a.co/d/1rjsrPK

That should be more than sufficient power for this setup.

For a very weird reason. ,"TL;DR - My windows were glued shut, had to use a knife to seperate the rubber seals from the glass, did someone put glue on my truck? Or is there some logical explanation for this. 

Just had something very weird happen and I wanted someone else's opinion on it. 

So I haven't driven my truck in two days, go out tonight to grab my wife a coffee and when I get to the drive through my window won't go down. At first I'm like damn okay, it's winter these things happen. I had it happen once last winter after a snow storm, didn't do a good enough job clearing the ice off. But wait.. there hasn't been any snow, and there's no ice on my truck? Why is my window stuck... 

I start trying my other windows, passenger side is fine, completely normal actually.. even weirder. Then I try the drivers side rear window, it's stuck. Okay? But why. As I'm fiddling with the switches I notice something, when I push my window to go down it pulls on the door frame itself, like it's being sucked down with the window. Wtf? How could it be suctioned to the window... Or wait, it's almost like glue. 

I get home, hop out and start feeling the bottom of the windows where it meets the door frame, and yeah it's almost like it's glued together, I can't pull the rubber seal away from the window. But on the passenger side I can. So I get the idea right away to grab a knife from the kitchen and stick it into the door to seperate the window from the seals. Works, fixed it right away. 

So like... Am I insane, or did someone glue my windows shut? Can't think of how this could happen naturally. ",1,1734054655.0,F150Lightning,0,1.0,False

1hd15yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hd15yd/hm_the_tear_factory/,[HM] The Tear Factory,"Inside the intricate labyrinth of Claire’s tear ducts, a factory buzzed with relentless activity. The Tear Factory—as its workers called it—wasn’t usually a high-stress operation. On a normal day, the team would process a modest amount of tears: a few during a heartfelt movie, a couple more when Claire chopped onions, and maybe a single shift’s worth on a particularly frustrating day.

But not this month. Not since December 1.

“I’m telling you, lads, we can’t keep up like this!” bellowed Gus, the grizzled foreman of the Tear Factory, as he wiped his brow with a cloth already soaked in saline. Gus had been on the job for decades, ever since Claire was a baby and cried nightly over lost pacifiers. He’d seen his share of heavy workloads, but this? This was a rare event.

“She’s crying again!” shouted Mabel from her station near the lachrymal gland controls. A klaxon sounded, signaling yet another incoming wave of tears. “We’re running out of saline reserves, Gus! If this keeps up, we’re gonna have to dilute with eye drops!”

“We don’t use eye drops here,” Gus growled. “We’ve got standards, Mabel. Just keep that gland pumping!”

The factory’s machinery groaned and sputtered as Claire’s tear ducts worked overtime. Conveyor belts carried freshly manufactured tears down toward the ducts, where they spilled out in perfect salty droplets. Each tear sparkled under the factory’s harsh fluorescent lights before being jettisoned into the world.

“Does she ever sleep?” muttered Frank, a junior technician tasked with monitoring tear viscosity. “I swear, it’s been twelve straight days. She’s got to be dehydrated by now.”

“Sleep?” Gus snorted. “Sleep doesn’t stop heartbreak. Trust me, I’ve seen it before. This one’s a doozy.” He gestured toward a massive control panel that displayed the source of the factory’s relentless workload: a glowing red alert labeled **ELLIOT: DECEMBER 1 INCIDENT**.

Next to it, slightly dimmer but still ominously present, was a faded yellow alert labeled **MICHAEL: 2008 COLLAPSE**. Gus tapped the panel with a sigh, his voice tinged with weary nostalgia. “Ah, Michael. That was a real doozy too. Her college sweetheart. The one who got away—or rather, the one she left behind to chase bigger dreams.”

Mabel glanced over, her brows knitting together. “Wasn’t he supposed to be ‘the great love of her life’ or something?”

“Yeah, well, he was,” Gus said, leaning heavily against the console. “Back in ’08, we thought we’d never see the end of those tears. Double shifts, emergency saline imports, even Myrtle came out of semi-retirement to help keep things running.”

Myrtle adjusted her glasses and chimed in from the lubrication department. “That breakup nearly shut us down. We had to implement a rationing system. Remember the Monday Night Sobfest? I still have nightmares about that.”

Frank’s eyes widened. “Wait, wasn’t that the one where she cried so much during a Patty Griffin song that the ducts hit critical capacity?”

“Bingo,” Gus grumbled. “We were seconds away from a full-system shutdown. If it weren’t for that emergency drainage we rigged, we’d all be out of a job.”

“Michael,” Mabel muttered, shaking her head. “He was a real piece of work, wasn’t he?”

“Eh,” Gus said, shrugging. “He was fine. Smart, charismatic, good with her family… but you know how it goes. She left, and we still ended up handling the fallout. Different kind of heartbreak, but heartbreak all the same.” He jabbed a finger back at the glowing red alert. “But this one—this Elliot guy—he’s giving Michael a run for his money. We haven’t seen numbers like this since the Great Heartbreak of ’08.”

Mabel crossed her arms. “Think we’re looking at another decade long recovery?”

Gus groaned. “Don’t even joke about that.”

The team shuddered at the mention of his name. Elliot—the man who’d shattered Claire’s heart and, by extension, their standard eight-hour shifts.

Over in the lubrication department, Myrtle, the oldest worker in the factory, adjusted her glasses and sighed. “She used to cry for good reasons, you know. Watching those sad dog commercials. Saying goodbye to her kids on their first day of school. Now it’s all him, him, him.”

“Cut her some slack,” Mabel said, her voice softer now. “You know how she is. When she feels something, she feels it deep. That’s why we’re here, isn’t it?”

The others nodded solemnly. Despite the grumbling, they all knew the truth: their work mattered. Every tear carried something important—grief, love, regret, hope. It was their job to make sure Claire could let it all out, even if it meant double shifts and empty coffee pots.

“Coffee pots?” Frank grumbled under his breath. “I’ve been downing those hydration packets. If I have to squeeze one more electrolyte gel into my mug, I’m quitting.”

“Quitting?” Gus barked, glaring at him. “You think heartbreak takes PTO? We’ve got a job to do!”

As the day stretched on, the machinery continued to hum, and the workers pushed through their exhaustion. Gus barked orders, Mabel tinkered with the saline injectors, and Myrtle polished the tear ducts to ensure maximum efficiency. They were a team, united by Claire’s endless sorrow and their dedication to helping her through it.

Just after lunch—which consisted of a communal bag of pretzels and some dubious-looking protein bars—Mabel leaned over to Gus. “Do you think she’s crying over something specific?”

“Specific?” Gus huffed. “Her crying has subplots, Mabel. Subplots!” He gestured toward a chart on the wall, labeled **REASONS FOR TEARS (CURRENT SHIFT):**

* 47%: Elliot-related heartbreak
* 22%: Existential dread
* 18%: That sad Taylor Swift song she keeps playing
* 13%: General overthinking

“We’ve got breakdowns for the breakdowns,” Gus muttered.

Then, just as the clock ticked past midnight, the klaxon went silent. The factory stilled. Gus looked up from his clipboard, his weathered face etched with confusion.

“Is it… is it over?” Frank whispered.

The team held their breath, listening. Outside, Claire sniffled once, twice, and then… nothing. The silence was deafening. Slowly, the workers began to relax, their shoulders sagging with relief.

“About time,” Gus muttered. “Get some rest, everyone. We’ve earned it.”

But just as they began powering down the machines, the klaxon blared to life again, louder than ever. Mabel’s eyes widened as a new alert flashed on the control panel:

**CLAIRE: VOICE MESSAGE REPLAYING (ELLIOT, DECEMBER 7)**

The team groaned in unison as the factory sprang back into action.

“Alright, back to work!” Gus shouted. “We’ve got tears to make!”

Myrtle sighed, adjusting her glasses once more. “I should’ve retired in 2009.”

And so the Tear Factory churned on, its workers tired but determined, knowing that Claire’s heart wasn’t done breaking—and their job wasn’t done either.",2,1734053857.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Last week, while using the app, I saw a polished silver KBVG for about $200, so I jumped on it right away. 

However, in my rush of a purchase, I must not have realized it was a used Moccomaster from Amazon. Inspecting the unit, it looks in pretty good shape and appears to work fine (ran without coffee grinds), but the obvious concern is where it came from before Amazon decided to resell it and how it was treated before then. 

I am considering keeping it because I know the reputation of how well these are made, but the warranty doesn't apply anymore since it is not new or refurbished. 

Has anyone had experience with a used one before? Is there anything I should check or test out before I decide to keep it or return it and wait for a new one to go on sale again?",1,1734053661.0,Moccamaster,7,1.0,False

I’m not a coffee roaster or a professional in the industry — just a curious coffee enthusiast trying to learn. My goal is to train my palate with something reliable while being confident that the premium I’m paying reflects the roaster’s actual expertise.

I figured that, since taste is subjective, there must be other signs of a roaster’s skill beyond “this tastes good.” So, I’m curious if there are any qualities, techniques, or markers I can watch for in their process, approach, or even the beans themselves.

Here are some of the things I’m wondering about:

* Do things like certifications, training, or industry recognition actually matter?
* Can I make any assessments visually just by looking at the roasted beans? If so, what should I be looking for?
* Should I pay attention to how they talk about sourcing, flavor profiles, or brewing methods?
* How can I measure consistency over time? Are there simple tests that I can perform at home to know whether a roaster is consistent from batch to batch?

I’m hoping to hear from industry folks or experienced coffee enthusiasts. What sets a great roaster apart from a rests, how should I know to avoid a roaster, and how can I recognize that I’m getting something consistent and well-crafted?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become an increasingly popular cosmetic procedure, and for good reasons. Many individuals are curious about the transformative effects of teeth whitening, especially when they see impressive before and after photos. These visuals can spark interest and motivate people to explore the options available for creating a brighter smile. But beyond just aesthetics, there’s a lot to discuss regarding this procedure's impact on confidence and self-esteem.

When you look at before and after images of teeth whitening, the differences are often striking. You may notice a significant change in the brightness and clarity of the teeth. Before whitening, teeth might appear dull, stained, or yellowish, especially due to habits like drinking coffee, smoking, or poor dental hygiene. After treatment, however, the teeth can look several shades lighter, giving you a vibrant and healthy appearance.

### Different Types of Teeth Whitening

It's essential to understand that not all whitening methods are the same. The most common options include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Treatments:** These are professional-grade whitening treatments provided by dentists. They use stronger bleaching agents and usually offer the most noticeable results in just one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** Many people choose over-the-counter whitening kits, which can be effective but typically require more time to achieve desired results.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** While these can help remove surface stains and brighten teeth slightly, expect minimal change compared to other methods.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for home remedies like baking soda or coconut oil. However, effectiveness can vary, and they might not provide dramatic changes.

### How Teeth Whitening Works

Teeth whitening primarily works through the use of bleaching agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These agents penetrate the enamel and break down stains, resulting in a whiter appearance. The strength of the product, along with the application time, plays a vital role in how effective it is. Professional treatments provide immediate results because dentists can apply high-concentration solutions safely.

### The Emotional Impact of Teeth Whitening

The before and after effects of teeth whitening extend beyond physical appearance. The boost in self-confidence that comes with a brighter smile is palpable. Here’s how teeth whitening can impact your life:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Enhanced Confidence:** Many people report feeling more confident in social situations after whitening their teeth. A bright smile can make you feel more attractive and approachable.
- **Improved Social Interactions:** When you are confident about your smile, you are more likely to engage in conversations and express yourself freely.
- **Positive First Impressions:** A bright smile can leave a lasting impression. Whether at a job interview, on a date, or meeting new friends, a whiter smile can positively influence how others perceive you.

### What to Expect Before and After Treatment

Before undergoing teeth whitening, it’s crucial to consult with a dentist. They can help determine the best method for your needs and check for any underlying dental issues. During the treatment, you might experience some tooth sensitivity, but this is typically temporary.

After the whitening process, your smile can transform remarkably. To maintain that brightness, consider the following:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Things like coffee, tea, red wine, and berries can stain your teeth post-treatment, so try to limit these.
- **Regular Oral Hygiene:** Maintain a consistent routine that includes brushing twice a day and flossing daily.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** Depending on the whitening method used, you might want to plan for periodic touch-ups to keep your smile fresh.

Teeth whitening can be a life-changing experience. With brighter teeth, you can feel a renewed sense of self which may impact various aspects of life positively. Remember, a healthy smile is not only visually appealing but also a reflection of personal care and good hygiene. If you are considering teeth whitening, examine the before and after possibilities to see how this simple procedure could significantly enhance your daily confidence and interactions with the world.

Safe Practices for Achieving the Best Teeth Whitening Results
-------------------------------------------------------------

When considering teeth whitening, many people are eager to achieve that radiant smile but don't always know how to do it safely. Understanding safe practices will help you get the best results while protecting your teeth and gums. Here's what you need to know!

### Consult with a Dental Professional

Before starting any whitening treatment, it's essential to talk to your dentist. They can evaluate your dental health and recommend the most suitable options for you. A dental exam can help identify any underlying issues, like cavities or gum disease, that might affect the whitening process.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Choose the Right Whitening Method

There are several methods available for teeth whitening, each with its pros and cons:

- **In-Office Treatments:** These are performed by a professional and often yield the best results. They use stronger bleaching agents and take less time.
- **At-Home Kits:** These can include trays or strips. Make sure these products are ADA-approved to ensure safety and effectiveness.
- **Natural Remedies:** Options like baking soda or activated charcoal may be tempting, but results can be inconsistent and sometimes risky for enamel health.

### Follow the Instructions Carefully

Whether you opt for in-office or at-home treatments, adhering to the instructions is very important. Overuse of whitening products can lead to tooth sensitivity or damage:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- For trays, ensure they fit well; ill-fitting trays can cause the bleaching solution to leak and irritate gums.
- For strips, apply them for the recommended time. Excessive use won't necessarily lead to whiter teeth and may harm enamel.

### Take Care of Your Oral Hygiene

Good dental hygiene plays a role in achieving optimal whitening results. Here’s what you should do:

- Brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.
- Floss daily to remove plaque between teeth.
- Use mouthwash that fights bad breath and bacteria.

Maintaining a healthy mouth helps keep your teeth looking their best, even after the whitening treatment.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Be Mindful of Food and Drink

Your diet can affect the brightness and longevity of your whitening results. Here are some tips:

- Avoid foods and drinks that stain teeth, like coffee, red wine, and dark sodas, especially after treatment.
- Eat crunchy fruits and vegetables (like apples and carrots) to help scrub your teeth clean naturally.
- Stay hydrated! Drinking water can help wash away food particles and prevent stains.

### Manage Tooth Sensitivity

Some people experience tooth sensitivity after whitening. If you notice discomfort, you can:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Switch to desensitizing toothpaste.
- Reduce the frequency of whitening treatments.
- Ask your dentist for solutions specifically catered to manage sensitivity.

### Limit Smoking and Other Staining Habits

Smoking can not only stain your teeth but also lead to other dental issues. If you are serious about maintaining a bright smile, it’s best to limit or quit smoking altogether. Additionally, be aware of habits like eating staining foods frequently.

### Regular Dental Check-Ups

Maintaining your oral health through regular dental visits can contribute significantly to the effectiveness of whitening. Your dentist can offer professional cleanings to remove plaque and stains that regular brushing might miss, helping keep your smile vibrant.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
By following these safe practices, you can ensure that you achieve beautiful, whiter teeth without compromising your dental health. With the right approach, you can confidently smile knowing you have taken steps to enhance your appearance while safeguarding your teeth!

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can be a life-changing experience, transforming not just your smile but also your confidence and self-esteem. Many individuals who undergo whitening treatments report a noticeable difference in how they feel about themselves, with before and after results often showcasing stunning improvements. A brighter, whiter smile can enhance your overall appearance and encourage you to flash that smile more often.

However, achieving these transformative results requires more than just a desire for whiter teeth. It's essential to understand safe practices that will lead to the best outcomes. Consulting with a dental professional before starting any whitening treatment is crucial. They can guide you on which methods are safest and most effective for your unique situation. Additionally, following the manufacturer’s instructions for at-home products or adhering to your dentist's guidance for in-office treatments will prevent potential harm to your enamel and gums.

Ultimately, whether you're considering whitening for a special occasion or simply seeking to boost your everyday confidence, understanding the transformative effects—and the best practices to achieve them—will set you on the path to a dazzling, healthy smile.

1hd0v89,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/1hd0v89/love_the_hope_in_you/,"Love, The hope in you!","Love is like a sky full of dreams. Just out of reach, but close enough to see. The hope of it, sparks the heart in wonder.

That The day we give up on love, the one who wishs you to find them. Living under the same moon and stars. Dreaming of the day you fall into their life, becomes lost. Unaware they lost hope, this time cluelessly long before thier path to you.

You took that away. That pontential of love. While they are sonderly living in the background of your life. They became lost looking to hope, into another person for a dying dream. Sure this may be idealistic, but... we never really know what could of happened, within the framework of a predictable life. Living the same day over.

By giving up now...they have no path to find you. Bleeding out in time. When Days, weeks, months even years fall short in someone else. I found, finding love is a story not a destination. Not one person, but paths. Little worlds in people we meet. How even we become strangers of ourselves distanced in time.

Their story might still be in the making right now. Another chapter without you in it, that they are falling in love. Just which way?? That's the question.

They might need to fall out of love, to fall into a new perspective. They are finding a way to fall for you. To start looking for you, that's anything but hopeless romance.

They might be in a relationship now. You might be sitting patiently, or even lost in depression. That your in a time of self love, becoming 100% of who you are, for them. I've been afraid to go out, and live. To let myself live. To say what's on my mind, bubbling within me. Now i give it my all, that I'd rather live with regret, than die with it. Sitting stuck in what ifs...

I found as the days blur together, one ordinary day. That day. Will be anything but ordinary. The day you keep walking into the coffee shop, going to read your book in the park, said yes to a fun night out. Well Anything really, something new, even something mundane. Standing in the line to get your groceries. Even a simple friend request. A random message on reddit could spark a path. That maybe you need to heal for them. Future you, needs you to grow now.

It takes just 2 people to discover love... that its really that simple. Its a choice, to say yes to each other. Read these words, go discover hope, discover love.. DO NOT MAKE IT HAPPEN. DO NOT FORCE LOVE. Just to check off little box's to say I'm yours. Settling for what people say. Someone's 15 minutes of fun, only to be alone again.. that those memories fade just as quickly as they come.. Mind you, those relationships have and can work. That despite everything being ""perfect"" keep in mind. It only takes one person to break it. Its becomes a option. You become a option to them.

Just please don't stop!! Just Give the future of your story a fighting chance. You will you find someone? Maybe not now, but tomorrow maybe.. one day you find yourself in the start of your journey. Completely lost not knowing your firsts are coming just as quick as the lasts.

Yes... yes you will find your love. Keep hope.. hold steady in it. Keep love in your favor. Let the unknown days ahead play out. Give them a path...a chance to find.. YOU!

Keep Living life, its so simply complex, because one day. You will walk out your door to find love. One day you'll be just a few steps away....you'll never know it. But you will... ohh I bet you looking back on that day you. You will sit and think who else, but them? That day. You went out into the world, you decided to stumble into them. The day you went back home new, the day you stopped waiting. That ordinary day. Became anything but simple.

Just promise me you wont change yourself, becoming another lost person. Who still cant find, what they want. Not knowing who they are, being stuck pretending. Self absorbed and hopeless in saying they want love. But they keep changing for it, when someone is out there lost. Looking for the ghost of you.

Do that for me, trust your eyes that reflect off this screen. Go out and live a little. Be bold in stride, walk with hope. Show some confidence in courage. That takes real guts, staying who you are. Being yourself completely, because most people arnt. They stop Getting back up, getting hurt.  They are fallen in love, felled by love... Remind yourself that the pain means its real. That your moving forward.

Your not a fool, love doesn’t make people naive or stupid. It means we care enough to believe in something genuine. To seek out that lost connection, to find trust. Were they a fool to hope it was you, to want to connect again?

Perhaps the bigger question is whether the impersonation of love was deliberate. Being in love with love. How you both can move forward with clarity. Knowing both of you were tricked. Lying within yourself. Showing trust and vulnerability isn’t foolish. It’s human, its honest. Its hope. It’s natural to want deep connection, even at the risk of being hurt

People will lie, cheat and steal in the name of love. Only Just to throw it away. Even hurt you, because those hopeless broken people. They lost their path, they gave up.

Well who knows. They just maybe haven't found you yet, that you didn't give up. So they could still be growing. Be a reminded, for that part of them they lost. That you helped them heal, by being the kinder part of this world.

Just do that, risk being the fool. Stick in kindness, become a hopeful romantic!",5,1734052938.0,selflove,2,1.0,False

1hd0s7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1hd0s7j/i_think_ive_found_love_again/,I think I’ve found love again ,"It’s been just over 2 years since my husband passed. His death was tragic, and I still fully believe it should have been me.

Quick back story, I (37f) have terminal cancer, I had a transplant in 2022 and was in hospital for 3 weeks, there were times where it was touch and go as to whether I’d make it - obviously I did.

I came out of hospital and 4 days later my husband woke up on the Monday morning and said he couldn’t catch he breath, I told him to take his time, he stood up to go to the bathroom and that was it, he collapsed on the bathroom floor and died right there in front of me.

I did everything I could, CPR while on the phone to 999 waiting for the ambulance to arrive, I literally watched him turn blue, it an image I still have nightmares about.

He was only 38 years old when he does and it was put down to covid which I personally think is a load of shit but that’s another story. 

When I was diagnosed with cancer we had some very hard conversations but we both agreed whoever went first the other was to move forward and keep living and to find love again. 

This year I dipped my toe into online dating that’s been a very scary thing to do, I’ve had a few dates, spoke to some very strange people and met a couple of people for coffee dates who usually ghost me when they find out about my husband and my cancer.

However 3 months ago I was in the process of coming off the apps, and I had a like on Facebook dating of all places…we matched, chatted, met for coffee. 

He then took me to a fancy restaurant for my birthday and he’s now lay in bed next to me. 

This man accepts me for who I am, he knows everything in my history, he accepts that I wear my wedding ring and he worships the ground I walk on. 

He’s told me he loves me and I have told him the same, I genuinely think I’ve found love again.

I have pangs of guilt sometimes which I guess is normal, and there are some people (1 in particular) who’s basically told me I should be alone forever and they don’t agree with me meeting someone. 

This guy is so kind and caring, he is protective in a non overwhelming way, he helps me with my meds, understands when my fatigue from the cancer is so bad I can’t get out of bed. He is such a lovely man and I feel guilty for saying I’m happy…but I am.

My husband will always be my husband he will always be my soulmate however I do hope if he is still around he would approve of this man.

They aren't completely sold on changing their last name, but the one thing we could agree on was to hyphenate (Gottfried-Weiss). Unfortunately, we just Googled it and found out that it's the name of a very high up Nazi soldier (not entirely unexpected given how German the name is, but very unfortunate). 

  
I've been playing around with some other options, but we haven't found anything we both love. We're mostly looking at names with Bengali/Indian, Jewish, and/or French backgrounds. 

Here are a few we've brainstormed: 

Weissfried or some variation — it ends up meaning something weird like ""white peace"" or ""white God"" which is... not great

Tauben — I love this one (it means dove in German; white + God's peace = dove) but my partner doesn't like it.  

Shada/Sada — White in Bengali, feel ""meh"" about this

I just felt like if I did get pregnant I couldn’t get off all this crap and still function, but I know that’s not fair to the baby either. Are there special OBs out there that help moms who are on antidepressants or are smokers? I want to be a mom but I also want to do it the right way, and I don’t know if I can

I am in lake tahoe for 5 days and a bit overwhelmed with lodge choices. Does anyone have any recommendation for a nice rustic lodge with a big fire place and seating with possibly a bar/coffee shop that is open to public? 

Is that even a thing? 

I am on the Nevada side around golden nugget. Any info would be greatly appreciated. ",2,1734051891.0,laketahoe,2,0.75,False

Not only is this going to cost you less, It's going to save you time, its going to taste better, it's going to negate all the nasty habits that 13 yr olds hold, it's going to be funner, it's going to build your cooking skills, it's going to get faster.

1hd0f0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1hd0f0k/big_law_ma_to_banking/,Big Law M&A to Banking,"Hey, y’all—been thinking about the jump to banking from the law for a while now, so wanted to get some of your thoughts/guidance. Apologies in advance if this isn’t the right forum for this question.

For some background: 

In college, I had admittedly terrible grades so I never got the opportunity to interview for banking/consulting like a lot of my friends. After college though, I killed the LSAT, was able to get into a top law school, where I got good grades, and then ended up in M&A big law at a good firm. 

After a couple years in big law, however, I’m starting to get the feeling that the law may not be for me longterm. I love working on deals, but I think working on deals from another, more quantitative perspective would suit me more. 

While I’m ignorant of this industry, I think I could be a somewhat compelling candidate—very good interviewer, good communicator, client-facing from early on in my legal career, good quantitative skills despite the old adage about lawyers and math, etc. 

With that context provided, here are my questions to y’all: 

1. What’s the likelihood of a candidate with my profile making the pivot? 

2. Could you recommend me any good resources for learning more about your industry, in particular any good interviewing/recruiting/etc. guides? 

3. Is there anything else that you think might be good to know from my perspective? 

Finally, if anyone is down to talk with me about any of this, I’d be more than happy to send an e-Starbucks gift card or something to make it like a virtual coffee chat. 

Thanks in advance.
