So ayun, I was at SMX Convention Center since last Friday pa and despite of bickering kung paano pumunta duon sa Lugar nayun and all, it went well Naman for me. Since last Friday, para maagapan antok ko, I walked around sa venue and buy Fresh brewed coffee every afternoon. Ayun, while there, one barista has managed to catch my attention, like oo na na attract ako. Hahaha. 

Nung Friday, a Barista stood beside me and asked for my order and ayun she gave me a paper providing me the order and my real name pa! Hahaha. They made a mistake by giving me a Senior Citizen's discount, like I am 26 huy hahaha tapos gulat siguro si Cashier dahil PRC ID ko pinakita ko sa kanya. Pero ayun nakuha ko yung coffee ko on a cheaper price. 

The next day Naman, same time ako bumili Ng coffee sa kanila, mga 3pm hehehe. Same order, Brewed coffee with no cream and sugar at yung barista na kumuha Ng order ko the previous day ay katabi niya yung cashier and she whispered my name to her and ayun I paid for my coffee on a regular price. Natatawa ako sa response ni Cashier na ""Thank you so muchhhhhhh"" pero Yun gosh naalala nila name ko sa kabila Ng Marami Silang customers na kine-cater since Friday pa sa SMX. After that interaction ay nakaisip ako Ng plan for the barista na crushie ko hahaha. 

Tapos ayun, yeah kanina hahaha. I went for my final purchase sa coffee shop na nasa loob Ng SMX Convention Center with a plan to do something thoughtful Kay Ms. Barista. Since maraming customers nu, si Ms. Barista ay kumuha Ng orders including mine. And nung time na kinukuha na niya yung order ko which is the usual Brewed Coffee, I made my move na. I showed her my phone with this message:

""Ms. Barista, may I ask po kung anong kape Ang gusto niyo po sa menu? Libre kita.""

Tapos ayun nahiya Siya. Sabi niya na di daw Siya nagkakape at baka pagalitan Ng manager niya. Pero nung inalukan ko Ng Caramel Macchiato, Sige Siya pero nung tinanong ko kung hot or cold di sumagot hahaha. Since ayun tumanggi sa coffee, Sabi ko food nalang and Sabi niya na may food Naman Sila. Di na ako nag insist pa, well Yun yung decision niya ehhh hehe. After nun tinanong ko parin sa cashier kung pwede ako manlibre sa Isang staff and binulungan niya manager niya and Sabi sa akin di pwede. Ayun back down na ako. 

Ang funny lang Kasi si cashier kabisado na niya order ko hahaha. After paying umalis narin ako sa shop and I passed through Ms. Barista without saying Hi or any word. Yun lang epic fail ako pero that's ok hahaha. I guess company policy lang din talaga. 

Ayun lang, I hope na lighten up ko yung mood here sa subreddit and I wish Ms. Barista well. Thank you sa kanya Kasi ayun may unting bundle of joy ako while going through that event hahahaha. Ang awkward Ng last interaction pero ayun I wish her well sa life niya. To you Ms. Barista, I hope nababasa mo ito if ever hehehe. 

See you around nalang din and I wish you well in life.

1lndb2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueNarcissisticAbuse/comments/1lndb2z/roommate_is_a_narc_and_is_locked_on_me/,Roommate is a narc and is LOCKED on me,"I don't know what it is that I do, or what type of scent I wear that just absolutely attracts these people. I just moved out of ANOTHER house because of a weirdo roommate (stole stuff, never cleaned, lied to landlord) and I JUST quit my other job because of an overt narc manager (who everyone at the job was aware of but couldn't fire because of staff shortage), to just now move in with ANOTHER overt narc.

  
I have to vent and don't need much advice as I have become very well-read on how to deal with these people, but I mainly just want to blow off major steam. 

Ever since I moved in, I noticed this guy took issue with me. He always interrupts when I speak, always turns the conversation back to him, strokes his own ego nearly every time he starts talking, always disagrees with whatever I have to say (even if it's an arbitrary fact, like ""the sky is blue""), oh and obvious gaslighting when he is caught blatantly lying. Not only to me, but obviously to most women of the house he speaks very condescendingly. Always giving unsollicited advice, explaining stuff you didn't ask for, taking stupid argument points to start discussions, laughing at you for doing something as dumb as cutting garlic, yadiya.

He, however, tends to have a special obsession with me at the same time (probably since I'm the newest in the house), where he will try to get as much alone-time with me as possible, and he is SET on asking me uncomfortable questions, or wants to know right around everything about me and my bf. He is also in the common areas 24/7 like he is just WAITING for people to walk in so he can yap their ears off, and will absolutely ignore if you are wearing headphones or are in a hurry. He will even act offended when you do not take your headphones off to fall into his dumb conversation-traps. 

One time when I was in the living room enjyoing my morning coffee with my boyfriend in silence, he had to interrupt to start bashing me about a book I had borrowed. It was such a dead-end conversation, where I literally told him multiple times I will give his book back right now if needed (it was in my room and I quite literally had not touched it). I did not look up from my phone and neither did my bf. Yet he had to go on a rampage about how ""you should have made time to read it"" and ""if you don't want it I can give it to someone else blah blah"".

There are other times where he insists on making me incredibly uncomfortable with sexual questions when I am alone. Asking me questions such as if I have found the majority of men that I have slept with to be more dominant/submissive (obviously to segway into how he is the total package by possessing a bit of both), or if women read erotic books as their form of self-pleasure (yes, he has actually asked this and way, way worse). When I opened up to my roommates about a serious inappropriate situation between me and a coworker, he turned to conversation to him. Whenever someone is having a conversation that does not involve him he HAS to interrupt in any way shape or form (starting to loudly read passages from his stupid bible-sized book, playing music loudly, or just interrupting in general).

My house is a 13-student flat on a university campus and is otherwise super close. House name, traditions, eating dinner together etc. So it's not really a matter of ""just be on your own"" (although that is what I am doing the majority of the time). We have to be semi-social and organise stuff together. As such, the guy has a whole social dynamic to put his insecure claws into and stir up drama. He shit talks roommates, sets really dumb narratives, always laughing behind people's backs, lies about others. Organising something is a literal hell because if I happen to be the one doing it he gets jealous and has to undermine any decision-making or ideas. And somehow - eventhough a lot of roommates have expressed their annoyance about him- he is still able to make an impression because he is JUST so OVERTLY convincing in how wrong he is. He just spews bullshit with no second thought, and I guess that is what always somewhat makes an impact. Also, a lot of people just don't think fighting him is worth the headache, since it gives him the attention he desperately craves.

  
Anyways, no I do not want to move out (and financially this is just not an option). I have to stay here for like, minimum a year but luckily my bf lives walking distance. So far, my tactics just consist of grey-rocking him when I'm alone with him, and ignoring his attempts to stir up debates. I'm also taking a short mental crash-course in regaining some self-trust. If you have any valuable advice from similar situations, feel free to share. But please understand I can not do anything drastic like completely isolate myself

1lndaxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lndaxd/where_the_dead_things_bloom_romantically/,Where the dead things Bloom [Romantically Apocalyptic Systemfall Litrpg]. Ch 1: Doggored,"Death came as a series of sensations rather than a singular moment as water filled my lungs.

My wrists struggled against the zip ties as I thrashed and yelled, instinct overriding the knowledge that no one would hear, no one would come. The sicarios had picked this old, semi-abandoned, forsaken apartment complex, as a place where a man could disappear in the night without witness.

I remember him looming over me before they pushed me under, a lieutenant with ""Santa Muerte"" tattooed across his throat, face pockmarked from old acne and adorned with teardrop tattoos cascading from his left eye. The gangster's shaved head gleamed under the bathroom's old, dim light bulb, revealing further art of elaborate crosses and Catholic saints that disappeared beneath the collar of his button-up.

His breath reeked of tequila and carne asada as he leaned close. ""Your brother should've paid El Jefe what he owed,"" he told me moments ago, pressing a gold-plated Desert Eagle my temple ""La familia pays for familia. Always.""

A platinum front tooth with a tiny embedded diamond glinted as his lips twisted into an uncaring smile. I hadn't spoken to my brother in three months, I hadn't even known that he got himself tangled with Los Águilas until they'd kicked through my door and dragged me from my apartment at 3 AM.

As I told the Los Águilas, I had no idea where my brother was, he was likely spending the money gambling, completely unaware or uncaring that his debts had caught up to me. My pleas meant nothing to them, and I couldn't possibly pay them what he owed, since I was just a university student with far too much debt hanging over me.

They took their time with the drowning. Made it a ghastly ritual. Four of them crowded into the moldering bathroom, passing a bottle of Clase Azul between them, placing casual bets on how long I'd last. The youngest one, barely eighteen with a face unmarked by tattoos, his eyes hollow and dead was recording everything on his phone.

""Para tu hermano,"" he explained, a heavy gold crucifix swinging around his neck. ""So he knows what happens when you don't pay up.""

The first submersion was brief. It introduced me to the panic, to the burning in my lungs. They pulled me up, allowed me a desperate gulp of air that tasted of mildew and fear. The lieutenant laughed as they pushed me under again. The second time lasted longer. Black spots danced at the edges of my vision as I thrashed and fought for air. My body convulsed against the restraints, animal instinct fighting against the inevitable. By the third time, something inside me had begun to break.

When they shoved me under for the final time, the lieutenant's ring-covered fingers gripping my hair, my movements grew weaker. All I could think of in that moment was how ordinary it felt to die in a random bathtub. How passe my erasure from the world would be. How little I accomplished at twenty-three.

I remember the moment my heart stopped.

Not darkness, as I always imagined it, but a strange, off-color, false illumination.

A message in silver sparks cascaded across the void, the text forming from nowhere:

**\[System integration commencing. Prepare for sub-reality nullspace re-calibration.\]**

Then another one.

**\[Absorption-phase of doomed world-matter into Systemfall boundary initiated. Please refrain from incoherent thought-panic. This is merely an update of your reality-space. Nothing to concern your linear consciousness with.\]**

The words appeared with the casual dismissiveness of a barista getting my name wrong for the fifth time. They burned themselves into what remained of my consciousness as I felt it spread outward from my failing body like ripples in the bathwater, touching everything, changing everything.

Then a progress **\[Loading …0%\]** bar flashed into existence.

I died.

I knew that I died because people didn't survive drowning in bathtubs.

And yet, I did not die because I focused all of my will on the progress bar, desiring to exist, desiring to go on no matter what.

The **\[Loading…\]** progress bar somehow kept me alive, the percentage ticking up painfully slowly.

My body dissolved slowly, cell by cell, muscle and bone and skin surrendering to time and water.

I was conscious throughout, trapped in the liminal space between existence and nothingness. Time stretched and compressed around me like taffy pulled too thin, then folded back upon itself.

Silver sparks flickered through the darkness periodically, bringing new occasional messages:

**\[Attempting to reconstruct linear thought-form multicellular subject from bathtub smoothie. This might take a while. Have you considered becoming a potted plant-being instead? Much simpler data-signature.\]**

Then another one.

**\[Processing organic matter-forms... Fascinating discovery of microbiome ecosystems within your digest-tube. We are designating the most interesting specimens as protected thought-entities. They have been given designation-names.\]**

And later still: **\[Rebuilding identity-cores and memory-webs... Encountered significant emotional-trauma debris fields. Preserving them despite inefficiency protocols. Your existence-baggage remains intact. Most Installers would recommend deletion, but we respect your attachment to your thought-form patterns.\]**

Each message carried the same tone of some irate, weary alien consciousness that seemed to have been assigned this resurrection duty as punishment for some unfathomable cosmic infraction.

**\[Reform sequence nearing completion-state. Enjoy your second-chance existence. You're welcome.\]**

Then came the blooming.

It began with a tingling at what had once been my brain, a gathering of matter and memory. I desperately clung to my identity, resisting slipping away into the abyss with every bit of my consciousness that I still wielded. My name. My memories. My absolute sense of self.

The small scar on my left thumb from when I was seven. The way coffee tasted on Sunday mornings. The precise color of sunset through my apartment window. My grandfather’s Siberian Husky dog Nessy who rescued me from nearly drowning in the Ferguson Quarry Lake when I was thirteen. I clung to these details with ferocious intensity, refusing to be subsumed, refusing to become merely another element in this cosmic reshuffling.

My flesh reconstructed itself, not from the soup of my remains that had mixed with the filthy water, but from something other, outsidery, eldritch, a thing that carried echoes of what I had been long ago. Yet within that vile process, I forced my particularity into each reforming cell. I was not simply a human being remade from cosmic dust, I was *me*, with all my flaws and features, my personal history and hurts.

I watched with gradually reforming flower-eyes as I bloomed from the bath like some terrible flower, particles of myself coalescing, reforming, becoming solid once more. With every moment in the state between life and death, I fought to retain my essence, to keep the core of my identity intact as time mercilessly marched on and on.

Nerves, muscles, ligaments, organs. It all grew from the bath-soup with unnerving, horrid slowness.

When awareness returned fully, I found myself naked, lying in a rotting bath. The porcelain was cracked and stained with rust-colored residue I didn't want to identify. Black mold crept across the ceiling and walls in fractal patterns. The air smelled of mold, of plants, rot, and something... horribly wrong, like myriads of mundane flavors entwined together into one.

I pulled myself up on trembling legs, skin slick with whatever fluid had birthed me back into the world. My reflection in the cracked mirror above the sink showed a face I recognized as mine.

Brown hair, green-brown eyes, a stubble.

Just like I used to be. Except I wasn’t me, more like an idea of me that manifested back into physical existence… long, long after I died. I pushed the horrid memories of my reconstruction away.

The human mind was good at ignoring inconvenient things, effective at forgetting traumatic experiences.

The abandoned apartment was a mess. Nature had begun to reclaim it. Vines crept through cracks in the walls. Patches plastic-looking moss that glistened with violet iridescence covered portions of the floor.

I searched the rooms, slowly moving on unsteady legs that remembered how to walk only through muscle memory, trying hard not to step on broken glass or a rusty nail. In what had once been a maintenance closet, I found a construction uniform, dirty orange coveralls with silver stripes a faded G logo on it. The fabric felt unnervingly rough my new skin, but the outfit gave me anchor to the human I had been long ago. The muddy boots sitting below the uniform were a tad too big for my feet, but I pulled them on regardless, lacking any other options.

I refused to think of myself as a thing that bloomed from a bathtub. I was a man and that was that.

Departing from the gloomy, dark apartment I entered the city.

The city… had seen better days.

Buildings sagged, windows gaped like empty eye sockets, and the streets had buckled and cracked, giving way to something that could only loosely be called vegetation.

Try as I might, I could not remember its name. Perhaps, I had spent so much time focusing on myself I had completely forgotten some things. Not like it mattered, because the city was gone, dead, hollowed out.

Trees grew everywhere, but they weren't the ordinary kind.

They were… aberrations, inorganic yet organic sculptures composed of whatever they had bloomed from. A streetlight had sprouted branches that bore fruit resembling small glowing orbs. A taxi cab had given birth to a massive trunk, its yellow paint still visible in patches along the distorted surface, with branches that terminated in leaves made from side-view mirrors.

I stood motionless on the crumbling steps of the apartment complex, the reality of this new world washing over me in waves of panic. The System had changed everything. And somehow, impossibly, I had been reborn into the heart of this transformation.

The taste of petrichor and electricity filled the still air.

In the distance, something odd moved between the freakish trees through the murky tendrils of fog rolling low across the ground.

At first, I thought it was a human—the silhouette suggested shoulders, a head, the familiar bipedal gait.

Hope tangled in my chest as I watched it approach.

That hope died quickly.

The thing that emerged onto the broken pavement was shaped like a female human but assembled wrong, as if whatever had created it had only seen humans from a distance and through fog. Its proportions were subtly distorted—arms too long, neck too flexible. Where a face should have been, features like eyes and mouths shifted and rearranged themselves in nauseating patterns, like wet clay being constantly remolded by invisible fingers.

In its hands, it clutched a rusted stop sign, wrenched from some forgotten intersection. The red octagon had faded to the color of dried blood, and the metal pole had snapped, leaving a jagged, lethal, rust-covered point.

It was wearing a dirty and sliced up mechanic's blue coveralls.

It saw me. Or sensed me. Whatever passed for perception in that writhing face seemed to lock onto my presence.

I should have run. That would have been the smart thing to do—flee back into the rotting apartment building, find somewhere to hide until this aberration lost interest and shambled away.

But my body rooted itself to the spot. There was no fight or flight in me at that moment, only pure, liquid dread.

The monstrous humanoid charged, moving with a stuttering, glitch-like motion. The stop sign whistled through the air as it swung the improvised weapon toward my body.

I tried to dodge, but it was far too late.

The jagged edge of the stop sign caught me across the abdomen, tearing through the orange coveralls and my body beneath. Pain exploded like white fire as the metal sliced deep, parting skin and muscle with horrifying ease. I felt something warm and wet spill down my front, watched in disbelief as loops of intestine threatened to escape the wound.

**\[Health: 80% | Reconstitution: 100%\]**

Silver text flashed in my field of vision, helpfully quantifying the damage.

Even as I registered the numbers, I felt a strange tingling at the site of the wound. Gasping and spitting blood, I watched as my spilling insides suddenly took on root-like properties, veins and blood blossoming into mushroom and mold-like forms. Flesh-roots rapidly weaved themselves through the gash, pulling tissue together, stemming the flow of blood.

The numbers flashed, rapidly changing to:

**\[Health: 81% | Reconstitution: 99%\]**

The creature gurgled with annoyed static, drawing my attention back to it.

""What the fuck are you?"" I gasped, retreating across the cracked concrete.

The female-shaped thing made disturbing, twisted sounds punctuated by fragments of human speech, letting out disjointed syllables and phonemes that never came together into coherent words.

Its not-quite-face rippled with what might have been curiosity, or hunger. The features continued to shift and flow, occasionally forming recognizable expressions—seduction, fascination, cruelty, joy—before dissolving back into a horrid mess of shifting flesh. It tilted its head, seemingly intrigued by my healing ability, a multitude of colorful eyes blossoming across its head.

It advanced towards me as I retreated, distracted by numbers flashing in my vision.

**\[Health: 82% | Reconstitution: 98%\]**

The thing swung again, the stop sign arcing toward my midsection speed. This time I was ready, sidestepping and grabbing the pole as it passed. The rusted metal bit into my palms, drawing blood.

The cut slowly resealed itself.

**\[Health: 80% | Reconstitution: 97%\]**

We struggled over the weapon, a perverse tug-of-war that sent us staggering across the debris-strewn street. The creature's strength was inhuman. It wasn't simply stronger than me, but wrong, as if it could selectively ignore the physics that bound my muscles and tendons to their limitations.

Up close, its wrongness was even more apparent. Its skin had the texture of wax left too close to a flame, and beneath the surface, millions of silver, worm-like shapes moved and pulsed like fish swimming beneath ice. It smelled of ozone and rot and something sweet and cloying that reminded me of overripe fruit left to ferment in the sun.

With a violent twist, the creature suddenly wrenched the stop sign sideways, snapping my wrist with a wet crack. Pain exploded up my arm as bone fragments pierced skin.

**\[Health: 75% | Reconstitution: 96%\]**

Mushroom-roots bloomed and pulsed at the wound site with silver radial shimmers, my shattered bones knitting together even as I screamed and swore.

The creature tilted its not-head, a moment of curiosity rippling across its features. It struck again, the jagged edge of the stop sign shearing through my shoulder and nearly severing my arm.

**\[Health: 69% | Reconstitution: 95%\]**

My arm hung by threads of muscle and tendon, but already the Reconstitution bullshit was working, reconnecting tissue, rebuilding what had been destroyed.

The creature made that static-noise again.

It advanced methodically, the stop sign dripping with my blood. It swung again, and this time the metal connected with my ribs, caving in my chest cavity with a sound like wet kindling breaking.

**\[Health: 47% | Reconstitution: 94%\]**

I collapsed to the ground, air bubbling through the ruins of my lungs. The flesh-roots worked frantically, rebuilding my shattered sternum, reinflating punctured organs. The pain was beyond comprehension, not just the agony of injury, but the alien sensation of being unmade and remade simultaneously.

The creature loomed over me, its face-space parting to reveal a spiral of glass-like, transparent, misshapen teeth. It dropped the stop sign and plunged one hand directly into my chest, fingers elongating into knife-like protrusions.

**\[Health: 35% | Reconstitution: 93%\]**

I felt it rooting around inside me, fingers probing my insides, likely questing for a way to finally put me out of my misery.

Then with a snag and rip of tearing flesh, I saw the monstrous thing holding my heart. It held my heart in its claws and yet I somehow wasn't dead.

It crushed my heart spraying me in blood.

People definitely didn't survive without hearts.  
  
**\[Health: 0% | Reconstitution: 82%\]**  


That should have been that. Yet, I was somehow still alive. Alive without a heartbeat.

Suspended between life and death. Conscious. Aware of being carved apart.

Its other hand reached for my face, fingers stretching toward my eyes. Through the haze of pain and horror, I saw the stop sign lying just within reach.

Reconstitution ticked down while my health ticked up.  
  
**\[Health: 12% | Reconstitution: 77%\]**

As the creature's claws pressed against my face, beginning to sink into the soft tissue, I lunged sideways, receiving a few cuts across the face.

My hand closed around the blood-covered metal pole. The creature, distracted by its dig through my internal organs, didn't react in time as I swung the jagged end into the side of its head.

The improvised spear punched through its temple. There was resistance, then a giving way—not the wet, organic yield of flesh being pierced, but something odd, like pushing through layers of static electricity.

The thing above me convulsed, its hand still buried wrist-deep in my abdomen.  


**\[Health: 13% | Reconstitution: 76%\]**

With the last reserves of my strength, I pushed with both of my arms, driving the steel handle deeper, twisting it like a key in a lock.

The monstrous thing went rigid, vibrating at a frequency that made my vision blur. A high-pitched keening filled the air, an eldritch sound that seemed to exist simultaneously inside and outside my head.

Then… silence.

**\[Health: 29% | Reconstitution: 60%\]**

I hissed, gurgling blood, watching as Reconstitution ticked down while my Health ticked up.

**\[Health: 31% | Reconstitution: 58%\]**

I pulled the stop sign out of the hole in the thing's head, ready to strike again, if it healed itself like me.

It did not.

Instead, the body of my enemy began to crystallize from the head down, the grotesque features freezing into a mask that resembled a dozen faces screaming in unison. The process spread downward, immobilizing its torso, its arms—including the one still partially embedded in my ruined abdomen.

With a final, desperate heave, I tore myself free from the crystallizing limb, feeling pieces of myself ripping away in the process. I collapsed beside the now-statue-like form, panting.

**\[Health: 32% | Reconstitution: 57%\]**

Slowly and painfully my flesh repaired itself. Bones knit together with audible cracks, organs resealed themselves, muscle and skin rewove themselves in bewildering patterns.

I could feel my strength returning, my vitals stabilizing, my form back to something approaching wholeness.

For a few minutes, I lay there beside my crystallized attacker, watching the gloomy sky intersected by monstrous, concrete-textured roots stretching between tilted buildings. The status indicators flickered one final time before stabilizing, utterly depleted of whatever power had saved me.

**\[Health: 89% | Reconstitution: 0%\]**

Death had come for me once in a filthy bathtub. It had come again today on a broken street. Both times, I somehow managed to refuse its embrace.

I looked at my body. It was covered in colorful bruises and dark scars, aching all over.

As I stared at the final reading, a new dread settled over me. I had no idea how—or if—this Reconstitution power could be recharged.

I touched my healed stomach, feeling the phantom pain of organs being ripped out. If I encountered another of these creatures, I would have no miraculous healing to save me.

I pulled myself to my feet, staring at the crystallized, female-ish form of my attacker. Today I survived by the narrowest of margins. Tomorrow, if there was a tomorrow for me, I would need to be smarter.

This new, System-controlled world was clearly out to murder me.

Suddenly, new silver text flickered into existence inside my eyes.

**\[Congratulations on a successful termination of… \_a LV 10 Unrefined Conceptoid. These half-formed thought-entities often develop aggressive tendencies during transition periods. Your efficient disposal is noted and appreciated.\]**

I wiped blood from my hands, staring at the message.

**\[Clearance points allocated. Random reward generation initiated.\]**

A triangular-shaped symbol materialized above the corpse, composed of light that seemed to exist in more dimensions than it should as the text faded. It rotated slowly, undulating between different forms and possibilities, a human shape, then a weapon, a tool and myriads of other symbols I didn't have the energy or time to interpret.

I stared in bewilderment.

The symbol flickered more rapidly, then stopped on a simple icon: two humanoid silhouettes standing side by side–one pink, the other blue.

**\[Category randomly generated: Companion.\]** The text returned.

""Companion?"" I repeated. ""Like... another person?""

**\[Please state desired companion concept parameters.\]**

My mind raced through possibilities.

Who would I want beside me in this nightmare world? My thoughts turned first to people I had known—friends, family, girls I dated—but each face that rose in my memory came with complications, with betrayals both small and large.

My brother's cruel smirk appeared unbidden, and anger flared across me, hot and immediate. He was the reason I had died, his debts becoming my death sentence. No, not him. Never him.

I thought of others; My coworkers, neighbors, even the barista who had smiled at me every morning for three years without ever learning my name. But trust... trust was the issue. Who could I trust in a world gone mad? Who had I ever really trusted?

Not my parents who constantly forgot that I existed, picking my brother as their favorite and showering him with their love and presents while taking my things away.

The answer came with sharp, brutal clarity: no one. No human, at least. Not even my grandfather who was kind to me once, but eventually drowned himself in alcoholism and gradually descended into Alzheimer's ranting about System Wizards.

But there had been Nessy, my grandfather's Siberian Husky. The black and white fuzzball who had pulled me from Ferguson Quarry Lake when I was thirteen. Who had always slept at the foot of my bed, who had listened to my adolescent problems without ever judging me.

A dog couldn't betray you or deceive you. A dog's loyalty was simpler, purer than any complicated human connection. A dog’s agenda was to follow the alpha, to take care of the pack. A dog could sniff out food, help me find much needed sustenance in these desolate ruins, warn me if something monstrous was coming ahead of time with a growl.

""A dog,"" I said aloud. ""Just like my grandfather's husky. One that can help me survive out here. One I can trust. Nessy! Bring her back if you can, just like you brought me back!”

The Companion symbol pulsed once, brightly, then reformed into the silhouette of a canine head. For a moment, I felt a flicker of relief—something familiar in this utterly alien landscape. I held my breath, hoping to get back someone that I loved and lost.

Then the symbol exploded in a shower of silver particles that rained down on the crystalline remains of the conceptoid.

The ossified, crystalline body cracked like an egg, splitting open with a blinding flash that made me stagger backwards.

When I blinked, clearing my throbbing vision, something… else was there, filling the blue coveralls.

Not a dog, but a girl—no, not quite a girl either. She rose from the shattered shell of the creature I had killed, shaking off sparkling, fading eggshell-like remnants like a dog shaking off water after a swim.

She was humanoid… but clearly not entirely human.

White and black fur covered her entire body in patterns reminiscent of a husky's markings. Her face was an unsettling combination of human and canine features—dark nose, a shortened muzzle, pointed, fluffy, dark ears that swiveled atop her head, long locks of hair that started pure black at the top and turned pure white when they reached her shoulders.

I stared at her, speechless.

*This wasn't what I had asked for. This wasn't what I had wanted at all!*

**\[Companion procured based on user desire and available conceptoid strata. Companion designation: Nessy.\]** The System notified me.

""Hey! This isn't what I meant,"" I said. ""I wanted a dog! An actual dog. Not whatever this fu...""

The dog-girl—Nessy, apparently—tilted her head in a gesture so canine it was jarring on her humanoid frame. She stared at me with wide, brilliant, blue eyes.

Then she lunged at me with startling speed, knocking me backward onto the broken pavement before I could react. My head cracked against the rubble, pain blooming bright and sharp at the base of my skull and all over me as the conceptoid stop-sign-made injuries throbbed madly.

""Alec! ALEC!"" she yelped, her voice human with a sprinkle of canine excitement. Her weight pinned me down as she frantically licked at my face, wide tongue slathering saliva against my skin. ""You're back! You're back! I found you!""

Her white paws—hands?—scrabbled at my shoulders, claws catching on the fabric of the borrowed orange coveralls. The proximity of her inhuman, uncanny face to mine sent panic surging through me. I pushed against her chest, struggling to create distance between us.

""Ow, owww, shit, damn it, get off me!"" I shouted, dropping the stop sign and finally managing to shove her aside. I scrambled, backing away with my hands raised defensively. ""Stay back!""

Nessy froze, her pointed ears flattening against her skull. Those piercing blue eyes—so familiar yet alien in her face—widened with hurt and confusion. She rapidly retreated away from me, hunched over, her posture suddenly submissive.

""Why are you mad at me?"" she whimpered. ""Don't you recognize me? Oh, you’re hurt.” She noticed my bruises and scratches. “Sorry… I got too excited. I’ve been looking for you for so long and…”

I wiped her saliva from my face with the back of my hand, trying to steady my breathing.

""You're not... this isn't what I asked for!"" I growled, slowly rising. ""I wanted an actual dog! A normal husky. Not... whatever the hell you are!”

Her head tilted in confusion, a gesture so fundamentally canine that for a moment, I could almost see the idea of the companion I'd intended to create, the memory of my best friend from my childhood.

""But I am a dog,"" she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. She gestured to herself with a fur-covered white hand that ended in black claws. ""See? Dog!”

""No, you're not, damn it!"" I growled. ""Dogs don't talk. And they certainly don't stand on two legs or have... Fuzzy hands with pink paw pads. Ugh.""

“Since when do you not like my paw pads…” she began and then something horrid howled in the foggy street sounding like a fax fused to a thousand pigeons. Something moved across the rubble with the sound of tapping feet. Too many feet for my liking.

Both of us froze, looked at each other and then rapidly retreated into the nearby shop, ducking behind a cracked wall.

The tapping of legs sounded closer. I peered through a crack in the wall.

Something vast and lanky shambled through the fog, its form only partially visible.

It looked like someone had grafted a municipal playground onto the body of a monstrous, hollow insect. A central dome made from a children's playground carouse rotated slowly at the creature's center, peeling, green and orange paint visible. From this central hub extended dozens of jointed legs made from playground slides, each segment connected by bulbous joints. The legs clicked against the pavement in an irregular rhythm that set my teeth on edge.

A twisted jungle gym formed a cage-like structure housing what looked like hundreds of swinging tire swings that pulsed like organs. Each ""tire"" contained a glowing amber substance that cast sickly light through the fog. The entire abomination moved with an unnatural grace, pivoting on its many legs as it seemed to search for something to snack on.

Nessy’s clawed hand dug into mine as both of us tried not to breathe.

We remained frozen as the creature pivoted slowly, its carousel body rotating with a faint, discordant melody that sounded like a corrupted music box. After what felt like an eternity, it resumed its clicking progress down the street, disappearing back into the fog.

""We should go,"" I whispered when the sounds had faded. ""Before it comes back.""

“Go where, Alec?” Nessy asked, her canine ears swiveling left and right. ""I don’t think that anywhere is particularly safe now. The System keeps creating new horrors by fusing things to things.""

I gave her a look.

*I didn't tell her my name. How did she know my name?*

“What?” She asked.

“You’re a thing the System created,” I pointed out.

“What?! No I am not!” She insisted.

“You’re a dog-human,” I said.

""I'm a dog!"" Nessy insisted, her fluffy black and white tail twitching with agitation. ""I've always been a dog! I’m not like that… living playground thing. We went to high school together Alec! We had English class together at Ferguson High!""

The name of the school hit me like another physical blow.

*Ferguson High—where I'd gone as a teenager.*

""Ferguson High didn't have any... dog-people,” I whisper-hissed. “There is no such thing as dog people. You’re the first dog-person I’ve met!”

""Yeah, sure. Next you'll tell me President Roosevelt didn't have his famous Scottish Terrier advisor during the New Deal,"" she rolled her eyes.

""Roosevelt had a dog named Fala, but it was a pet. It didn't advise him on policy!"" I pointed out.

Nessy's dark tail with a white tip swished behind her, cutting through the air with indignation. ""What are you talking about? Fala was Secretary of the Treasury! There's that famous photograph of him wearing those tiny glasses while reviewing economic policy."" She growled. ""Everyone knows that!""

I pressed my palms against my temples, trying to make sense of her words. The world had already transformed beyond recognition—buildings reclaimed by unnatural vegetation, streets buckled and broken, strange conceptoid creatures that offered rewards upon death, yet somehow this conversation felt like the most surreal aspect of my resurrection.

""Let me get this straight,"" I said, lowering my hands. ""You think... that you knew me in high school? That we took English together?""

""Of course!"" Nessy's ears perked up, her mood shifting with canine quickness. ""You sat two rows behind me. You always smelled like those peanut butter sandwiches your mom made that you pawned off to me."" Her nose twitched at the memory. ""And you were terrible at literature. I helped you study for midterms junior year!”

The details were oddly specific, yet completely wrong. I had indeed been terrible at literature, and my mother had packed those awful peanut butter sandwiches I hated, but there had been no dog-girl Nessy at Ferguson High.

I found myself staring at the white angel-wing markings that swept across her forehead—identical to the ones on my grandfather's husky forehead fur pattern. My chest tightened with a sudden, visceral memory: seeing these wings visible through murky quarry water as teeth closed around my clothes, dragging my unresponsive body toward the surface, toward life.

*My guardian angel.*

Nessy fidgeted under my scrutiny, her too-human hands nervously smoothing the matted fur of her arms. She was undeniably pretty, the crystalline ocean-blue of her eyes, the dark nose, the canid-human face, her fit, curvy body wrapped in fur that transitioned from midnight black to pristine white. However, she was beautiful in the way a porcelain doll is beautiful—flawless, idealized, and also… utterly wrong, surreal, impossible just like the playground-centipede.

""What do you remember about the quarry,"" I said suddenly, unable to stop myself. ""About what happened there when I was thirteen?""

Nessy's expression softened. She rocked on her clawed feet. ""You fell in,"" she said simply. ""You were showing off, walking along that concrete ledge where everyone went cliff-diving in the summer. You slipped and hit your head on the way down."" Her eyes momentarily clouded with the memory. ""I jumped in after you. Pulled you all the way to the beach a few hundred feet away. Almost freaking drowned myself since you kept clinging to me so hard.""

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. The events matched exactly what had happened, but with one vital difference—it was an ordinary dog, who dragged me from the water while the rest of my ‘friends’ did fuck all to help me.

""And then what?"" I pressed. ""After you pulled me out?""

""Your grandfather drove us to the hospital,"" she continued, the words spilling out with pure, absolute conviction. ""Doc Flanaghan—you remember him, that old, balding bloodhound?—he gave you three stitches in your forehead."" She reached out as if to touch my hairline where the scar had been. I flinched away instinctively.

""Doc Flanaghan was human,"" I said.

Nessy blinked rapidly, her head tilting first one way then the other. ""Are you feeling okay, Alec? Hrmmm."" She sniffed the air, nostrils flaring. ""You smell… like you. You’re hurt though. You must have hit your head and now you’re confused. Are you concussed?""

""I'm not the one who's confused,"" I snapped, frustration boiling over. “You're confused! Stop confusing me with this dog-world nonsense! This bloody place is confusing enough!”

Nessy regarded me with concern that made her look disconcertingly like a kindergarten teacher dealing with a difficult child.

""Alec,"" she said slowly, ""dogs and humans have always lived side by side. Worked together. Gone to school together. For thousands of years, since humans began to adopt wild wolves!""

""No,"" I insisted, ""they haven't.""

""Oh really?"" She crossed her arms. ""Then who was the first dog astronaut to walk on the moon alongside Neil Armstrong? Everyone knows it was Kira Pawstrong! There's that famous quote: 'One small step for man, one giant leap for canine-kind.'""

I stared at her. In her eyes, I could see absolute certainty—these weren't lies she was telling, but memories she genuinely believed. Memories of another, absurd world of humanoid dogs.

""Next you're going to tell me that Shakespeare was a dog?"" I chortled.

""William Shakespeare?"" Nessy's tail wagged slightly. ""Nah. He was a human. Mrs. Abernathy had us read 'Romeo and Juliet' junior year. 'Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona where we lay our scene...'"" She recited the opening lines perfectly. ""Classic tale of love between a human boy and a collie girl from feuding families.""

I couldn't help it—a slightly hysterical laugh escaped me. ""Romeo and Juliet were both human!""

""No, no, no,"" Nessy insisted, wagging a clawed finger at me. ""You're thinking of 'Hamlet,' which was all humans. 'Romeo and Juliet' was specifically about the tensions between human and canine communities in medieval Italy. It's Shakespeare's most famous exploration of species-based prejudice!” She declared and then looked past me, sniffing the air.

“Right… I'm so done with this conversation,” I sighed.

“Are you…okay?” She asked.

""As okay as I can be after dying horribly and fermenting in a bathtub for weeks,"" I let out.

Nessy's ears svivelled back, her blue eyes widening with horror. ""You… What?!""

""I was murdered. Drowned in a bathtub by cartel gangsters looking for my brother."" I revealed. ""I died, and this... System came.""

The dog-girl stared at me with a shocked expression.

""The System reconstituted me,"" I continued. “Rebuilt me. Molecule by molecule. Like the Ship of Theseus.""

Nessy studied me, her head tilting in that distinctly canine way. Her nostrils flared as she processed my scent, seemingly searching for truth. Seconds stretched into a full minute of silence.

""We didn't go to high school together. You're not real—not in the way you think you are,” I said. “You're… just something the System created when I killed a conceptoid thing five minutes ago.""

""No, no, no,"" she shook her head. ""I was the one who killed the conceptoid and made a wish on it to find you! Alec, it's me. It's Nessy. Your best friend!""

""My grandfather had a dog named Nessy,"" I stubbornly insisted, even though we were clearly at an impasse and starting to go in circles. ""A regular… husky!”

“I keep telling you, I’m a perfectly normal husky, Alec!” She showed me her fur-covered hands as if that proved anything.

“If the System didn’t make you, where did you come from?” I demanded.

""What do you mean, 'where did I come from'? Ferguson! I came from Ferguson! I've been searching for you for over a week!"" Her voice cracked.

I stared at her, contemplating the depths with which the System could generate a dog-person concept into existence by twisting my wish for a companion.

""I went to sleep in my apartment two weeks ago… thinking about you finally coming back home to Fergus this summer,"" she said. ""Then, these silver words appeared floating in my eyes, waking me up. ‘***System integration commencing. Prepare for reality recalibration***.’ At first, I thought I was dreaming.""

I pursed my lips.

*Great. She had a backstory and everything.*

""Then these… changes started when morning came. Slowly at first—dead things stopped decaying correctly. Then with each passing day… more and more freaky weirdness seeped through the cracks, messed up reality. Gradually, the world became a little less familiar."" Her ears flattened at the memory. ""But the worst of it wasn't from the System—it was from people. People who... became freakishly strong or fast or fused with other... things. Then mass panic started, riots, fires, anarchy. Everyone turned on each other while the dead refused to stay dead and broken things fixed themselves in impossible ways, blooming like alien mushrooms and flowers.”

She exhaled.

“Then the phone lines went down and I had no way of contacting you,” She shivered visibly. ""So I left Fergus, heading south. I drove until the road became impassable and then I ran for days… almost a week, I think. Almost died in a junkyard. Been sleeping in abandoned buildings, scavenging for food, dodging gangs of looters and undead, freakish… things. The whole time, I kept thinking about that Avicii animated music video we watched together—you know, the one with the dog running through gunfire and explosions, desperately searching for her best friend after he was conscripted to go to war? That's how I felt. Like everything was falling apart around me, but I had to keep moving, ‘cus no matter what… had to find you!”

The Florida sky cracked open with gold and salmon light as the day began, and Koa stood barefoot at the edge of the dock, the boards cool and damp beneath him. The river had that glassy stillness that came before the morning tide. Out across the water, the old houseboat bobbed gently—its chipped paint now replaced with a warm honey glaze, wind chimes dancing from the awning, a tin pirate flag half-tangled on the rail. It had once been his hiding place. Now it belonged to Finn.

 

He heard the screen door creak and then slam softly behind him. Jess padded up next to him, a travel mug in her hand and sleep still curling in the corner of her smile.

 

“He’s already out there,” she said. “Woke up before six. Said he had to ‘check the perimeter.’”

 

Koa chuckled. “You create a clubhouse, you create a watchman.”

 

They stood together in silence for a while, the kind of quiet that comes not from emptiness but from comfort—ten years of early mornings, coffee shared without needing words, and the long, hard-earned peace of being home.

 

Behind them stood their house, tall and sprawling with wraparound porches and river breezes forever moving through open windows. Shade Tree & Co. had started with a single leaky skiff and a handful of stubborn ideas, but now it was a name people knew. A brand. Koa still didn’t love the word “brand,” but he loved the smell of fresh-caught snapper in the ice bins and the sight of Finn sitting on the counter at the Saturday market, helping sell smoked mullet like a pro.

 

“We should fix the rope swing,” Jess said suddenly. “The old one, off the cypress out back. I think he’s almost tall enough now.”

 

Koa looked over at her. “He is.”

 

“You sure?”

 

“I measured last week.”

 

She smiled again, smaller this time, and leaned into his shoulder.

 

From the houseboat, a whoop split the morning calm, and they both turned to see Finn leap from the stern, arms flung out like wings, disappearing with a splash.

 

“Jesus,” Koa muttered, already walking toward the dock ladder. “Did he even check for gators?”",1,1751199290.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

1lnd8jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1lnd8jk/positive_sa_experience/,Positive SA experience,"I wanted to share my experience since the positive stories really helped me in the weeks leading up to my abortion.
It was my second SA abortion. Just being completely honest, my first SA abortion was really hard on me afterwards. Not because of losing the fetus related, but I gained a lot of medical anxiety afterwards. My PP did not offer any sedation and the only pain reliever we were given before was ibuprofen. When I found out I was pregnant again three years later, I was gutted. I never wanted to have a SA abortion again and the pill just didn’t sound like a fit for me either given the anxiety. So I researched my options.
I found a medical center out of my state that I reside in that offered full sedation. I knew this was the only way for me personally. I was 12 weeks.
I cried a lot the week leading up to my appointment, but I got it done yesterday and wow. All I feel is relief. I have no trauma from the experience. The people were great, took great care of me, comforted me the whole way. Made me feel like a whole person, made me laugh, all the things. I don’t remember a thing. I felt no pain. I woke up relaxed, went back to the hotel with my partner, and ate a real meal feeling good for the first time in three months.
I woke up this morning mentally lighter. Had a coffee again. Feeling good physically. Ready to heal and move on. 
The point of this is to share the positive and to research all the options. I didn’t know this would be an option for me and I only paid $750 which isn’t a huge jump in what I was quoted for a non-sedated route and worth every fricken penny for me personally.

It's the Marino model which from my understanding is identical to the Urbano with the only difference being this has some different hardware that makes the bike rust resistant. It's a little cramped and flexy but I expected that from the design and price point. A gooseneck stem for a little more reach and some quick release metal pedals to eliminate the wobbly pedal strokes seem to be the only must-dos so far. I'm 6'1 and 220 for reference. 
Sadly, Starbucks is the only coffee shop open at 7:30am on a Sunday in my small town but at least we have that so I can't complain.

1lnd7sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1lnd7sx/observations_of_an_old_man/,Observations of an old man,"I woke up at 5:30AM this morning with an insight. the dots connected for me on a puzzling observation of mine. you know, one of those odd things you notice but not important enough to figure out right away. I decided to call it, an E.S.I. emotional support item. Everybody seems to have one. lucky coin, rabbits foot. good luck clothing item. things of the hard goods persuasion. But you also have the habit line of stuff. like those who can’t function unless they carry a pack of smokes with them everywhere they go. same thing with the people who always have a joint stashed on them somewhere. or a flask of something in their back pocket.

As I stared out my window watching the sun rise. I watched the morning ritual of the same people wandering around with their little pooch on a leash doing the morning bush watering. Then it dawned on me as I saw the dog hunker up and start dropping a load. How is this person going to pick up after her dog? She has the leash in one hand, and a cup of coffee in the other.

So every morning I look now and I see all these people wandering around with a cup in their hand. I have become obsessed! Everybody I see is always carrying something around with them. From bags to canes. cups of something to cigarettes hanging from their lips. Not to mention the constant cellphones in use. I would be hard pressed to find anyone without a damn phone on them. except me. Oh yes, I have one. but I never carry one with me. to me it seems goofy. probably because I’m old and there was always a phone booth damn near on every corner in town. To be honest, I hate the damn things. inevitably I will be right in the middle of doing something and that wretched thing will sound off demanding my attention. I pick up and it will be some sales person or robot call. Which only enrages me that much more. I guess I’m just one of those old farts from a bygone era that can’t quite adjust to changing times and the ways people behave. I think the world always does look different to people of twilight years. seeing changes we don’t or can’t adjust to.

Here is the floor plan ive made. So first things first, the pink curved line is the door so that cannot be moved. The light blue dotted line is the window so that cant be moved either. And then the purple dotted line is the opening (not a door) to the kitchen so that cant be moved but also nothing can be placed in front of that. 

Next, yellow object is the sofa, and that is the correct shape of my sofa so that can be moved but the shape cannot be changed. The three orange objects are all shelves, the one opposite the sofa has the tv on, and the orange triangle is a corner shelf (hence the shape), and then other is just another standard shelf. The dark green object is my tortoises enclosure. The lime green object is my coffee table. The dark blue rectangle is my desk and the dark blue circle is my desk chair. The three red objects are my easel (red triangle), chair (red circle), and art table (red rectangle). And lastly the grey rectangle is my filing cabinet.

1lnd58w,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1lnd58w/update/,Update!,"Friends, yesterday I posted about having relapsed after 230+ days. Here’s what happened after that post and here’s what I’ve learned 💖 

Recap: didn’t hit it again after I posted, instead I sat on the porch and talked to my dad while drinking my coffee in the sunshine. Let the vape sit for a bit inside, but then took it out with the the trash to the dumpster. So I had it for like half a day and one morning. 

I Learned:
• the buzz I thought I’d get? The relief I hoped to feel? It wasn’t really there. All it did was a give me a hard throat hit and immediate spike in heart rate. 
• the anxiety was palpable. I immediately, and I mean immediately, felt anxious out the wazoo. Why? Well I was right back into health anxiety. I was anxious about having broken my streak. I was anxious about that it meant going forward, and I was anxious about getting trapped in the grips of nicotine so deeply that I wouldn’t be able to get out for months or years again. I thought about having to hide at work (just got my first big girl job in healthcare) or during important events, or when I’m with important people in my life who deserve my attention and time. When I hit it in the morning, it was anxiety inducing as hell - I can’t believe it’s what my baseline was for 6 years. 
• I thought about vaping MORE when I had it. “Is it bad that I wanna hit it again? Can I just get away with a weekend? Am I fucked bc I caved? Am I back to square one? How will it feel with my coffee? Should I drink less coffee? My heart is racing. I’m scared”. 
• I felt like an imposter in my own body - my old self was coming back and it was so strange. I felt sad for her. 
• I wanted to go outside and find dopamine in the natural ways I’ve worked so hard for: first sips of coffee. Sunshine. Calling a loved one. Ice cold water. I never want to go back to the times where all of those lovely things wouldn’t be savored or recognized because of a vape taking the spotlight for my source of dopamine. Life is richer than that!!! 
• I appreciate this group SO much. Thank you for your kind words yesterday and know that it made a difference in me opting to continue choosing recovery. I’m not restarting the clock! A slip ≠ relapse. 
• I am worthy, even through my mistakes. self compassion and forgiveness is the only way to achieve the life I want. 
• My best tip if you feel like you’re headed towards relapse: the questions you have about “has anyone not regretted relapse, anyone done it for a couple days and been fine, etc” you know the answer. Be still, breathe, and know: just like quitting the first time, it comes from the intrinsic desire to live a fuller life, unburdened by nicotine. Find that again and push onward. Read these stories and lean on this community/your loved ones!! 

The quote I saw yesterday in another thread resonated with me: “Don’t let the hurt child in you make your adult decisions.” 

Let us all keep healing, with grace and intention. We’ve got this! 234 days of choosing myself. It’s worth it! (just maybe make it 233 🤫💖)

First cups I ground on my Ode 2 at 6.2; the brew went as per the recipe, but obviously with the fines migration, the final drawdown easily pushes TBT to 4:15 (he places TBT at 3:30).  Astringency in the cup noted.

Next cups ground at 7.1, I found that mid-brew, specifically after the first pour to 120g, as I wait to do the third pour at 1:30, the water in the brewer has completely drawn down by 1:15 (that is the bed of coffee sits ""dry"" for 15 s).  This makes sense as it lends itself to the coarser grind, but again at the end, TBT is easily 4:00, with soooome astringency in the cup (albeit less than the cup ground at 6.2)

Curious for your input and experience with this recipe and Ethiopian beans.  I'm wondering if Ethiopian beans simply wont work with this recipe, and biases them more to less pour Devil Recipe, and the fewest pour CC recipe that I use.  Thanks all!",1,1751198857.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I am turning 40 this year, I have an amazing wife and a young child. Good job and am generally very content with life.
But, I was always a bit heavy so last year I started weight training. Since then I lost almost 20kg/40pounds and I am feeling much better and more confident.

I think in early life I was very average looking and always shy to talk to woman. I had one serious 2 year relationship before, then 2 years of some dating and now a 9 year relationship with my current wife.
Since loosing weight I notice girls looking at me, holding my gaze etc. I also lost my shyness over the last few years and freely engage in smalltalk with people. 
For the first time in my working career (tech) I now work in a company with at least 50% women and I have started (via some work app) going on lunch/coffee walks with people.
Last week my (25F) colleague I sometimes go on walks with told me I have been her work crush for some time. We joked about it and then that was it.

But now I have this feeling of FOMO and ""is this it?"". I am confident, I guess pretty ok looking, still young and I feel like I am missing out on things.
Mind you, my relationship and sex life is really good but all of the sudden I think ""shit, I can never have sex with someone else again"" and ""wow, a hot 25yr old is interested in me"".
Opening up our relationship is not an option (we would both be jealous) and I think in general a road to disaster so how to get rid of these feelings?

First few times the coffee was sputtering so i tried every advice: i boil the water before pouring  it in the bottom part (tried boiled and lukewarm water), i have it on low-medium heat on the induction stove (9 out of 19), i use coffee grinded for a moka pot, i always fill the bottom right under the vault, i never pat my grinds, i fill the pocket and distrubute it evenly with a fork and close it tightly. 

I do the SAME thing every time and sometimes it comes out slow and barely sputtering, sometimes i leave in on the stove for 10 and nothing even comes out while it's obvious something is happening down there and then once every full moon it comes out quick with perfect crema.

i cannot figure out what the problem is: is it the induction stove or is the pot shit? it was a gift, i originally planned on buying a bialetti moka but i got this...so now i don't know if i should just give up on moka pots or actually buy the bialetti...or will it be the same story...

This is the exact moka pot i have,, does anyone have/has had the same one and had any troubles?

I was in contact (texting and calling) with I guess one of the sales team members over the past week. I expressed interest in a 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, but said that I live about 2 hours away but wanted to see the car. I had applied for financing, talked about price, I was very intent on potentially buying the car the day I drove down. Everything sounded normal and I scheduled a time to meet him. I told him exactly when I'd be there and kept in contact with updates throughout my drive and when I arrived. This is where it got weird.

 He had me meet him at a lot that was not the dealership. He said it was an overflow lot, which I guess makes sense, but no idea why he wouldn't just drive the car to the showroom and meet there. When I get there, I call the guy and he says that he's a few minutes away, that he's driving the car and had to make some stops. I end up waiting at this lot for 45 minutes. The lot was full of cars that looked like they had been sitting there for months, most of them with heavy damage, flat tires, and emreally dirty.  He finally pulls up, and this guy is in cloth shorts and a dirty T-shirt. He apologizes, shakes my hand and says the salesman is on his way. About 15 minutes later some guy pulls up in a crappy Nissan sedan, in a ratty t-shirt, loose fitting sweatpants, and croc sandals. He doesn't introduce himself, just walks right past us and goes to talk to the other guy. Meanwhile, my dad and I are looking at this car. The car itself was crazy dirty, didn't look like it had been cleaned since they bought it a month ago. Crumbs in every crevice, dog hair everywhere, stains on the seats. Mechanically the car sounded fine, with the exception of the backup camera not turning on. The tires were all low on tread, and one of the compartments was broken inside. Also someone left an open coffee thermos in the backseat. 

The only good thing I can say was this guy wasn't pushy, but he also didn't look like a legit car salesman, even by used car dealer standards. I don't even know if there is an actual showroom. For all I know the Google listing was fake and this lot was all they actually have. My advice, go buy a used car in PA, DE, or MD if you're around this area. ",1,1751198345.0,UsedCars,3,1.0,False

We add a tiny human to our household last year, and since then it has been glaringly obvious that his needs come above everyone else in our home.  For example, his garden is top priority on the weekends, we live in the city and grocery stores are plentiful.  Even if they were not, he doesn't grow nearly enough produce for us to consider living off of it, he literally just likes playing in the dirt.  When I asked for the same me-time activity of going to the gym, I maybe get a ""yes"" once every 2 weeks, and it can not be on the weekends.  He also is musician on the side, allowing him leave for several hours on weekends and afternoons to perform.  He does this enjoyment, though it does bring a small amount of extra income.  He refuses to go grocery shopping and only does his own laundry.  I have asked for help with both things and he says he doesn't understand how to wash my clothes, so he refuses.  The biggest thing for me, which is probably the most immature thing, is that he doesn't really seem to know me or acknowledge me as a spouse.  He refuses to buy me flowers or gifts thay are not practical (he bought me a blender for Christmas so I could make baby food) because ""they are a waste of money."" Yet, he can spend thousands on his garden...that has very little practical value.

The kicker for me was my first Mother's Dag this year.  He brought me coffee in bed and showed me pictures of a necklace he planed to buy.  I asked a few days ago about when the necklace was going to arrive and he said that he decided against buying it, ""it doesn't seem practical anymore.""

I haven’t been on this subreddit for years. I quit around 5 years ago for 60 days but got sucked back in to the world of coffee. It was only until a few months ago that I started feeling extra stressed with work and decided I want to try getting off of caffeine again. 

Like many of you, I have been reflecting on when I first started having caffeine and what life was like around that time. For me, it started in university when I wanted that “edge” for studying. I also started taking pre workout for my workouts. University was also when I started having panic attacks and my sleep started getting worse. Which led to drinking caffeine more regularly (atleast two coffees per day and preworkout 3-4x per week). 

I seemingly had an influx of issues pop up after I started my caffeine habits. Could that be one is the causes? Or was caffeine a way to cope with my already existing issues?

My decaf journey is now going to be figuring out whether my current exhaustion has been a result of consuming stimulants for the last 13 years or whether there’s some underlying mental health issues that have gone unresolved. Either way, quitting caffeine is going to allow me to explore myself more clearly. I am already feeling like I have a better awareness of what’s going on in my body. When I was consuming caffeine, everything felt like a blur and I felt very disconnected from myself. That’s not to say, I feel fully connected, but it’s definitely feeling better.

I think the hardest part for me is dealing with this exhaustion every morning. My sleep habits are really consistent and I’m getting 7-8 hours per night but the tiredness in the morning and throughout the day is the one symptom that’s hard to push aside. 

Anyways, I’m glad to have this community to fall back to in the early stages. It motivated me to keep pushing even though I’m still early on at Day 19. I will be making some updates along the way if there are any major shifts.

There’s my personal cereal bowl with a cat who’s just noticed a mouse sleeping on the rim, two headless birds that are also candleholders—the glazes I used I forget now—but I believe are smoke with Riverbirch over them in spots, and another single candleholder that is sea salt glaze over white clay with a whale who is carrying his friend the seal in the seals boat, (the candle goes inside the boat) I’ve got another of those in the works,

It’s supposed to be black obsidian claws holding up a bowl that should have looked more like it was leopard spotted, but it ran due to the kiln firing to a cone 6 instead of the usual cone 5 ( I didn’t know we were firing that high before I glazed any of these).

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of the best drink dispenser with stand involves careful consideration of several key features that directly impact its functionality and longevity.

**Material and Construction:** The materials used in the dispenser's construction are paramount to its durability and resistance to wear and tear. Options range from glass to acrylic and Tritan plastic, each offering different levels of clarity, weight, and shatter resistance. The stand’s material, frequently enough metal or wood, should complement the dispenser and provide stable support, preventing accidental spills or tipping. A high-quality build ensures the dispenser can withstand frequent use and maintain its aesthetic appeal for years to come.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** The capacity of the dispenser is crucial, especially for larger gatherings. Dispensers typically range from 1 gallon to 3 gallons or more. Consider the number of guests you typically host and the types of beverages you plan to serve. Larger capacities minimize the need for frequent refills, while the dimensions of the dispenser and stand should fit comfortably on your serving table or countertop without taking up excessive space. Look for dispensers that offer a balance between capacity and practical dimensions.

**Spigot Design and Functionality:** The spigot is a critical component, as it controls the flow of beverages. It should be leak-proof, easy to operate, and made from a food-grade material like stainless steel or BPA-free plastic. The design should allow for smooth, consistent pouring without drips or spills. Some spigots feature a continuous pour function, while others require holding a lever. The height of the spigot above the stand base must also be considered, especially if you intend to fill tall glasses or pitchers.

**Ice Core or compartment:** Many modern drink dispensers include an ice core or compartment to keep beverages chilled without diluting them. These features are particularly useful for outdoor events or during warmer months.An ice core is a central tube that can be filled with ice, while an ice compartment usually surrounds the inner beverage container.Both options effectively maintain a cool temperature and prevent the beverage from becoming watered down as the ice melts.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** A drink dispenser should be easy to disassemble and clean thoroughly to prevent the buildup of bacteria or residue. Look for dispensers with wide mouths that allow for easy access to the interior. Removable spigots and ice cores simplify the cleaning process. Consider the material's resistance to staining and odors. Dishwasher-safe components are a notable advantage, but hand-washing with warm, soapy water is generally recommended for optimal care.

**Aesthetic Design and Versatility:** The aesthetic design of the drink dispenser should complement the style of your event or home décor. Dispensers come in various shapes, sizes, and finishes, from classic glass designs with ornate stands to sleek, modern acrylic dispensers with minimalist stands. Consider the overall look and feel you want to achieve and choose a dispenser that enhances the visual appeal of your serving area. Versatility is also significant; a dispenser that can be used for a variety of beverages,from water and lemonade to cocktails and sangria,offers greater value and versatility.

Key features of the best drink dispenser with stand include:

* Durable construction materials
* Sufficient capacity for various events
* leak-proof and easy-to-use spigot
* Integrated ice core or compartment
* Easy cleaning and maintenance
* Aesthetically pleasing design

## Core Benefits

The best drink dispenser with stand offers numerous benefits that enhance the serving experience and provide convenience for both hosts and guests.**Improved beverage Presentation:** A drink dispenser elevates the presentation of your beverages, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to any event. Rather of simply placing bottles or pitchers on the table, a dispenser showcases the beverage, allowing guests to see the colorful contents and enticing them to partake. This visual appeal can substantially enhance the overall ambiance and create a more inviting and festive atmosphere.

**Enhanced guest convenience:** With its easy-to-use spigot and readily accessible design, a drink dispenser provides guests with a hassle-free way to serve themselves. They can easily refill their glasses without having to ask for assistance or wait in line. This self-service function empowers guests to manage their own beverage consumption, freeing up the host to focus on other aspects of the event.**better Temperature Control:** Dispensers equipped with an ice core or compartment ensure that beverages remain chilled for an extended period, even in warm weather. This is particularly beneficial for outdoor events or gatherings where maintaining a cold temperature is crucial. By preventing beverages from becoming lukewarm, the dispenser enhances the taste and enjoyment, ensuring that guests have a refreshing and satisfying experience.

**Reduced Mess and Spills:** The spigot design of a high-quality drink dispenser minimizes the risk of drips and spills,keeping your serving area clean and tidy. A well-designed spigot provides a controlled flow of beverage, preventing leaks and overflows. This not only reduces the amount of cleanup required but also prevents staining or damage to your tablecloth or furniture.

**Cost and Time Savings:** Using a dispenser can reduce costs,particularly when serving beverages in bulk. Instead of buying individual bottles or cans, you can prepare a large batch of your favorite drink and serve it from the dispenser.This is often more economical and can save you time and effort in the long run by reducing the need for constant restocking and cleanup.

## faqs Section

**Can I use the drink dispenser for hot beverages like tea or coffee?**
Generally, drink dispensers with stands are designed for cold beverages. Using hot liquids can damage some materials, particularly acrylic or plastic, leading to cracking or warping. Glass dispensers may be suitable for warm, but not boiling, liquids, but always check the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure compatibility.

**How do I prevent the spigot from dripping?**
Dripping spigots are a common issue. Ensure the spigot is securely tightened to the dispenser body. If it continues to drip, try disassembling the spigot and cleaning all parts thoroughly, removing any debris or buildup that may be affecting the seal. Some spigots have adjustable mechanisms that can be tightened to prevent leaks. If the spigot is faulty, consider replacing it with a higher-quality choice.

**What is the best way to clean the inside of the dispenser, especially the hard-to-reach areas?**
For the inside, a bottle brush with a long handle is invaluable for scrubbing the sides and bottom. You can also use a mixture of warm water and baking soda to remove stubborn stains or odors.Fill the dispenser with the mixture,let it sit for several hours,and then scrub and rinse thoroughly. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as they can scratch the surface. For particularly narrow dispensers, denture cleaning tablets dissolved in water can also be effective at removing buildup.

1lnclm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFinanceTrending/comments/1lnclm1/how_to_automate_your_savings_without_thinking/,How to Automate Your Savings Without Thinking About It (2025 Step-by-Step Guide),"https://preview.redd.it/jknqfkedru9f1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=beca9b250a3a3215ef87133395c69635da3b879d

Most of us aren’t “money people.” We’re tired. Our brains are fried from group chats, algorithmic doomscrolling, and remembering 37 different passwords. And now we’re also supposed to manually move money into savings every week? Absolutely not.

Here’s the thing: the biggest financial wins don’t come from discipline. They come from **systems**.

And in 2025, the smartest financial system you can build is this: **Set your savings to autopilot and forget about it.**

No budgeting spreadsheet. No guilt. Just money slowly stacking up in the background-while you’re watching “The Bear” or waiting for your UPI to load.

If you've ever said ""I'll start saving next month,"" this is the guide you’ve been waiting for. This is how you actually do it. No willpower required.

# Why Automating Your Savings Is the Easiest Way to Build Wealth

*(Targeting: benefits of automatic savings, why automating savings works, effortless savings tips)*

Let’s break down why automatic saving is the GOAT move for your finances-and why doing it manually is lowkey sabotaging your future self.

**What does automating your savings actually mean?**

Automating your savings means setting up a system where a set amount of money gets transferred from your income (or checking account) into your savings **without you lifting a finger**.

That could be:

* A % of your paycheck going into a savings account every payday  
* An app that moves $3 every time you buy something with your debit card  
* A weekly transfer set to hit every Friday like a chill version of rent  

The key is that it’s **predictable, invisible, and consistent**. Like a gym membership you forget you're paying-except it’s growing your money, not draining it.

**Why automatic saving works better than manual budgeting for most people**

Because real life doesn’t care about your budget.

Budgets look amazing in Google Sheets, but then real things happen: you get invited to an impromptu birthday dinner, your rent spikes, or Zara has a surprise mid-season drop.

Manual saving relies on you **thinking, remembering, and choosing** to move money. Automation removes all three.

It’s the difference between saying, “I’ll go to the gym when I have time,” and having a trainer knock on your door at 7 a.m.

**How automating savings removes emotional spending triggers**

Ever moved money to savings and then instantly transferred it back when you felt broke or anxious?

That’s emotional spending. It’s impulsive, and it’s *very* human. The more decisions your savings depends on, the more likely it’ll get sabotaged by stress, FOMO, or just a late-night craving for sushi.

Automatic saving works because it **happens before your brain gets involved**. It’s like hiding cookies from yourself, but for cash.

**What behavioral science says about set-it-and-forget-it saving**

This isn’t just vibes-it’s science.

Behavioral economists like Richard Thaler (who literally won a Nobel Prize for this stuff) showed that **default systems** are one of the most effective ways to change long-term behavior.

In *Nudge* (Chapter 5), Thaler and Sunstein explain how “automatic enrollment” in 401(k)s leads to dramatically higher savings than opt-in plans. People stick to the default-so make your default *rich*.

# The compound benefits of automating small daily or weekly savings

$3 a day might feel like nothing. But if you automate that amount, you’re saving over $1,000 a year without ever feeling the pinch.

Stack that with interest, cashback, or an employer match (if you’re lucky enough to have one), and suddenly your chill little automation habit is compounding harder than your student loans.

Consistency > intensity. Always.

**Best Tools and Apps to Automatically Save Money in 2025**

*(Targeting: best automatic savings apps, apps to save money without thinking, fintech auto-saving tools)*

You don’t need 17 budgeting apps and a color-coded Excel sheet. You need one or two apps that do the work for you-quietly, consistently, and without nagging notifications that make you feel broke.

Here’s what actually works in 2025 (and what’s just fintech noise).

**Top automatic savings apps for passive savers (Qapital, Digit, Chime)**

If you want savings to happen without thinking-or feeling it-these apps are your new money BFFs:

* **Qapital**: You can set super-specific rules like “Save $5 every time I skip Uber and walk” or “Round up when I buy coffee.” It’s savings gamified, but low-key.  
* **Digit (now part of Oportun)**: Analyzes your income + spending habits, then moves small amounts of money you won’t notice. Think: $2.73 here, $5.11 there.  
* **Chime**: If you want a bank-account-level approach, Chime rounds up every transaction and moves the difference to savings. It also lets you auto-move a chunk of your paycheck.  

All three have one job: **make you save without you noticing**. And they do it really, really well.

**Which apps use AI to calculate safe-to-save amounts daily?**

This is where the 2025 money game gets smarter.

Apps like **Albert** and **Plum** (UK/US) use AI to study your cash flow and only save when you can actually afford it-without overdrafting you.

It’s not magic. It’s algorithms trained to protect your lifestyle *while still building your cushion*. They’ll say, “Cool, rent’s coming up, let’s skip savings this week,” and adjust automatically.

This is huge for freelancers or anyone with an irregular income (read: half of Gen Z).

**Pros and cons of roundup apps vs. scheduled transfers**

**Roundups**: Save a little each time you spend. Feels invisible. Great for passive savers.

**Scheduled transfers**: Save the same amount every week or month. Better for goal-based savings (like a vacation fund or emergency cushion).

**Real talk**: Use both if you can. Roundups build small habits. Scheduled transfers build actual wealth.

What I personally do? Round up everything, *and* set a $20/week auto-transfer every Sunday night. Feels like nothing, adds up to thousands.

**Best Tools and Apps to Automatically Save Money in 2025get them**

Almost every app now lets you name your savings goal-*“Trip to Goa,” “Emergency fund,” “Quit-my-job fund”*\-and assign a target amount + timeline.

Why that matters:

* Naming your goal = emotional connection  
* Timeline = urgency  
* Progress bar = dopamine  

You’re literally hacking your brain’s reward system. And it works. Studies show people are more likely to save *when the goal is visualized*.

**Are there free apps that let you save money automatically?**

Yes-and no, they’re not all trying to upsell you a $9.99/month “premium” tracker with budgeting pie charts you’ll never look at.

Here are legit free or freemium tools:

* **Revolut** and **Monzo** (UK) and **Chime** (US) let you set up roundups or scheduled auto-saves for free.  
* **SoFi** lets you create vaults inside your checking account with no fees.  
* **YNAB Lite** (beta access) has an automation feature that’s free for students.  

If you’re not trying to spend to save, **use your bank’s built-in features**. Many banks now let you set up rules like “move $50 every payday.” No app needed.

“Automation is to your finances what brushing your teeth is to dental health. It’s boring-but it prevents disaster.”

\- *Ramit Sethi, I Will Teach You To Be Rich*, 2nd Edition, Chapter 3

# How to Set Up Automated Savings From Your Paycheck or Bank

*(Targeting: split paycheck to savings, automatic transfer setup, banking rules for auto-saving)*

Here’s the truth no one tells you: you’re not bad with money. You’re just forced to make too many money decisions, constantly.

One of the most powerful ways to delete financial stress is to **remove yourself from the equation entirely**. And that starts by setting up systems *before* your money hits your main account.

**How to split your paycheck to savings automatically with direct deposit**

You don’t need to wait for payday to manually move money. If your employer uses a payroll system (and 95% do), you can **ask HR or log into your payroll portal** and split your paycheck.

Just enter two bank accounts:

1. Your main checking for daily spending  
2. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) for future-you  

Then tell the system: send 90% to checking, 10% to savings. Or 80/20. Or even $100 flat every payday-whatever feels doable.

This is the most invisible, willpower-free saving system out there. You never *see* the money, so you never miss it.

**Setting up recurring transfers in your banking app (step-by-step)**

If you don’t have payroll access (hi freelancers, gig workers, side hustlers), your banking app is your best tool.

Here’s how it usually works:

Open your banking app. Tap “Transfers” or “Recurring Payments.” Choose your checking account as the source and your savings account as the destination. Then pick a day (like every Friday) and an amount ($25 is a great start).

Set it. That’s it. You’re saving now.

And if you bank with places like Ally, Capital One, or Sofi, they’ll let you label that savings goal-so every week, your “Emergency Fund” or “Rent Buffer” grows in the background while you go about your life.

**How to use bank rules to trigger savings after bills are paid**

This one’s next-level, but powerful.

Some digital banks let you create **“if/then” savings rules**\-like: **If rent is paid → then move $40 into savings.** Or: **If balance is over $2,000 → save the excess.**

You’re basically turning your bank account into a money robot. It waits until you’re good, then quietly moves your leftovers into savings.

This is especially helpful if your income or expenses fluctuate, but you still want consistency.

**How often should you schedule auto-savings? Weekly vs. monthly comparison**

Weekly transfers are sneakier. They feel smaller, more doable, and give you faster momentum. Monthly transfers are heavier hitters. Better for people with consistent pay cycles.

If you feel nervous about commitment, go weekly. $10 every Monday feels like nothing-but after a year, that’s over $500 saved. Without effort. Without spreadsheets. Without burnout.

That’s why weekly > monthly for most people starting out.

**Can you automate savings across multiple accounts?**

Yes-and you should, especially if you want to:

* Build an emergency fund  
* Save for travel or big purchases  
* Keep your money goals organized (and visible)  

Think of it like mental accounting, but automated. One account says, “I’m here for your safety.” Another says, “We’re going to Bali someday.” A third says, “I’ve got your back if your laptop dies.”

Most banking apps now support multiple savings buckets or vaults. Some let you rename them. Use it.

The visual reminder alone keeps you motivated.

“Systems beat motivation. Every time. If you don’t build your savings into a system, you’re always one bad day away from blowing it all.”

\- James Clear, *Atomic Habits*, Chapter 2, Page 37

# Save Money Based on Spending Habits - Automatically

*(Targeting: save money without noticing, trigger-based savings, automate savings when you spend)*

You know that little dopamine rush when you tap your card and the payment goes through? What if every time that happened, you were also quietly building your savings?

This is where behavioral savings comes in. And it’s so good because it doesn’t ask you to stop spending-it just turns your spending into a trigger to grow your money. No guilt, just momentum.

**What are spending-based saving rules-and how do they work?**

It’s simple: instead of saying “I’ll save when I remember,” you flip the script. You set a rule: **“Every time I spend, I save.”**

That might look like:

* Saving $1 every time you buy coffee  
* Saving $5 every time you order takeout  
* Saving 10% of whatever you just spent  

These rules work because they **pair a habit you already have** (spending) with one you want to build (saving). It’s piggybacking your financial goals onto your real life, instead of trying to rewire your whole personality.

**Apps that save $1 every time you make a purchase (behavioral automation)**

Apps like **Qapital**, **Chime**, and **Monzo** let you create these spending-trigger rules inside the app. No coding. No setup headaches. Just pick the rule and let it run.

For example, you can say: “Every time I use my card, round up to the next dollar and move the spare change into savings.” Or: “Every time I spend at Zara, save $3 to my Rent Fund so I can feel less guilty.”

The point isn’t the amount. It’s the **automated behavior loop**. And once it’s running, you stop thinking about it. You just keep living-and keep saving.

**How to use IFTTT or Zapier to create custom saving triggers**

For the hackers and tinkerers out there: IFTTT (If This Then That) and Zapier let you build **custom rules** that move money based on whatever trigger you want.

You can do things like:

* “If I get an email from Uber Eats → save $4”  
* “If I get a Venmo payment → move 20% to savings”  
* “If I hit 10,000 steps on Fitbit → reward myself by saving $10”  

It sounds extra, but it’s basically turning your daily digital life into a savings machine. This is where money and motivation finally start vibing together.

**Automatically save a percentage of each purchase into a savings account**

This one’s low-key brilliant: some apps and neobanks let you **auto-save a fixed percentage of every spend**.

So if you buy something for $40, it’ll automatically save 5%-that’s $2 into your stash.

It feels like a mini tax you’re paying to your future self. And weirdly, it feels kind of empowering. Like you're building wealth on your terms, without starving your social life or cutting out iced coffee.

**How to gamify savings using behavioral triggers and challenges**

Apps like Qapital and Yotta take it even further-they turn savings into a game.

You can set challenges like “No Spend Sundays” and reward yourself with a $10 auto-transfer into your “Treat Yourself” fund every time you stick to it.

Others give you lottery tickets for every dollar saved, or visual milestones for every goal crushed.

This stuff works not because you’re obsessed with saving-but because **you’re obsessed with progress**. You want to feel like it’s working. And behavioral savings makes sure you *feel it* as it happens.

“The best way to change your money habits isn’t with guilt. It’s with design. Set your environment up so you win by default.”

\- BJ Fogg, *Tiny Habits*, Chapter 6, Page 119

# How to Stay on Autopilot With Your Savings (and Still Reach Your Goals)

*(Targeting: hands-off saving tips, set and forget savings, stay on track with auto-saving)*

Here’s the lie most people believe: “If I automate my savings, I don’t have to think about it ever again.”

That’s almost true-but not quite.

Automation is like cruise control. It gets you moving in the right direction without constant effort. But if you never check the dashboard, you might veer off course-or worse, run out of gas.

Here’s how to make sure your savings automation actually gets you where you want to go.

**How to review your automated savings monthly without stress**

You don’t need to do a full financial audit every month. But a five-minute check-in? Game changer.

Pick one day a month-first Sunday, last Friday, whatever. Open your savings app or bank account, and ask:

* Are the transfers still happening?  
* Do the amounts still feel right?  
* Is anything bouncing back?  

That’s it. You’re not judging yourself. You’re just checking that your money robot is still doing its job. Treat it like checking your phone battery. It takes seconds-but keeps things running.

**How milestone tracking in savings apps keeps you motivated**

To be honest, it’s hard to stay excited about saving for “the future.”

That’s why visual goal trackers matter so much. Apps like Qapital, YNAB, and SoFi let you set specific savings targets-and they show you exactly how close you are.

Even better? Some apps send you progress nudges when you’re halfway to your goal or just crossed 75%. It feels small, but that little hit of progress dopamine is *exactly* what keeps people going.

This is motivation without mental strain. You see a bar filling up, and you want to keep it moving. It's human nature-and your savings wins because of it.

**What to do if your auto-saving causes overdrafts**

This is a common fear-especially if your income isn’t consistent.

First, breathe. One bounced transfer doesn’t mean you failed at money.

Second, most apps and banks let you set **minimum balance rules**, so savings won’t trigger if your account dips too low.

If you’re using a bank transfer, just log in and update the schedule or pause it for a week. You’re in control-automation is flexible. It's not a trap. It's a tool.

And if you get hit with a fee, call your bank. Seriously. Many will reverse the first overdraft fee if you ask nicely.

**When to pause or adjust your savings automation**

Big life shifts = time to check your settings.

Lost a job? Going full freelance? Rent just went up? That’s when you hit pause or drop your savings amount by 50%.

It’s not quitting. It’s adapting.

You can always ramp it back up when life settles. What matters is not shutting down the system altogether. Keep it alive-even at $5 a week.

Momentum > perfection.

**How to balance automation with short-term spending needs**

This is where most people get stuck.

They try to save aggressively, then panic when an unexpected bill hits-and they pull all their savings out in frustration.

Instead, **build two systems**: one for long-term goals (like a vacation fund or emergency savings), and one for short-term cushion (like a mini “life happens” fund).

That way, when your car battery dies or your favorite artist drops surprise concert tickets, you’re not sabotaging your future. You’re covered. Smooth. Balanced.

This isn’t just smart. It’s sustainable.

“What makes automation powerful isn’t that it removes decisions-it’s that it preserves energy. Your bandwidth is limited. Protect it.”

# FAQ: Everything You Wanted to Ask About Automating Your Savings (But Were Too Tired to Google)

*(Targeting: easiest way to automate savings, saving on low income, safety of saving apps, overdraft concerns, how much to automate)*

# What’s the easiest way to start automating my savings?

Set up a **recurring transfer** in your banking app.

Pick a small amount-like $10 a week-and schedule it from your checking to savings every Friday. That’s it.

No app downloads. No budget spreadsheets. No new habits to build. Just one 3-minute setup that keeps working forever.

If you want extra ease, link a savings app like **Digit** or **Qapital** that does it automatically based on your spending. But your bank alone is enough to get started.

# Can I automate savings if I live paycheck to paycheck?

Yes-and it might actually be the best thing you do.

The key is **starting small and predictable**. Even $1 a day adds up. What matters most isn’t the amount-it’s the behavior. You’re building a safety net, drip by drip.

Plus, some apps use AI to detect when it’s safe to save (like Albert or Plum), so they *won’t* move money if your balance is too low.

This is savings that respects your reality-not some idealized budget fantasy.

# Is it safe to use apps that connect to my bank for auto-saving?

Short answer: **yes**, if it’s a legit app.

Most top apps (Digit, Qapital, Chime, etc.) use **256-bit encryption**, bank-level security, and don’t store your login info directly. They connect via **Plaid** or similar secure APIs, which are used by nearly every major fintech.

That said, always:

* Read reviews  
* Stick to apps with FDIC insurance (directly or through partner banks)  
* Avoid shady “get-rich-quick” ones that ask for weird permissions  

Security matters, but the risk of *not* saving anything is way worse long term.

# How much should I automate into savings each month?

Whatever amount you can move without feeling it.

For some, that’s $10/week. For others, it’s 15% of their income. If you need a starting point, go with the **50/30/20 rule**: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings.

But honestly? Even **5% saved automatically beats 0% saved manually**. Your goal is momentum, not perfection.

Once it feels normal, you can increase the amount. Set-and-grow, not set-and-forget.

# What happens if I don’t have enough money when the auto-transfer hits?

Good apps (and even most banks) will either:

1. Skip the transfer  
2. Retry it later  
3. Alert you with a gentle nudge-not a penalty  

If you’re worried about overdrafts, set a **minimum balance rule** so the transfer only happens if your account has enough cushion.

And remember: you can pause or change the transfer anytime. This is **your** system. You’re in control.

“Tiny money actions-done consistently-beat giant, unsustainable efforts every single time. That’s the real flex.”

As I got up to answer the door, my phone rang too. I checked who it was. Kian. My best friend. He’d probably seen the news. I declined the call and slipped the phone back into my pocket as I got to the door.

I looked through the peephole and saw exactly who I expected to see. Darren. He’d thrown a pair of jogging bottoms on but still had a bare chest and his right arm was by his side. He was holding something but it was hidden behind him. Of course this good-for-nothing lowlife would be the first at my door.

I turned to Carmen and gave a little nod at the wall behind her indicating the apartment on the other side, whilst silently mouthing ‘Darren’. The concern on her face was apparent but I gestured with my hands for her to head back to our bedroom. I wasn’t really sure what to do right now except make sure she was safe first. I didn’t plan on letting Darren in but I needed to think. He was only going to be the first of many.

The doorbell rang again.

“Come on River,” Darren said outside the door. “I know you’re in there. Just make it easy on everyone and let me claim the prize.”

“How about no?” I said, looking through the peephole again. Darren’s arm was out and I saw the eight-inch machete he had on him. Carmen brushed past me and made her way to the bedroom.

“Listen mate,” Darren said, “We can do this the hard way or the easy way. How long do you reckon this door will hold out.” To make his point, he charged the door with an outstretched kick. It shuddered. It wouldn’t hold out long enough. This was one of those times that I could really do with the extra time to think but that was time I didn’t have. The door continued to rattle.

There was no point grabbing a knife. I didn’t have any with the same reach as Darren’s. I ran to the bedroom, where Carmen was clearing out the wardrobes, shoving clothes – both hers and mine – into two good-sized gym holdalls on the bed.

“What are you doing?”

“We need to get out of here,” she replied, as she shuffled between the wardrobe and the bed, jerking open drawers, grabbing whatever she thought we needed. “You know there’ll be more coming.”

“You’re not tempted by the reward?”

“Not one bit,” she said, stuffing clothes into the holdalls. “Whatever that gem is, it has this ‘Pantheon’ spooked. Why else would they make such an offer for its return.”

“But we don’t know what this gem is. Maybe it would be better to just give it to them?” I said as I glanced back towards the hallway, the thuds of Darren’s kicks vibrating through the apartment. “Who knows what they’ll do if we don’t?”

She stopped and looked at me. “Who knows what they’ll do if we do? We don’t know what they’ll do with you. We don’t know what they’re capable of. They have technology that we don’t even understand.”

“So you’re thinking to keep the gem away from them?”

“At least until we know what it is. Until we know what they want. We have fourteen days to figure it out. We’ll take the girl with us. Maybe she’ll have some answers.”

This is what I loved about her. Why I stayed with her. She was practical. Pragmatic. It’s why we worked so well. Both of us were quick to make decisions, but she complemented me in a way that I needed. Someone who stood by my side, no matter the problem. Someone able to think through the problems when I couldn’t. Her reasoning was sound, and in truth, it worked for me.

You always had people claiming they’d do things for the greater good. Easy for them to say from their bedroom keyboards when it wasn’t their life on the line. I was no martyr, and I had no intention of giving myself up. Not until I knew more. We had some time to play with and we needed options, and for that, we needed information.

I grabbed her arm as she was going to the wardrobe again, and pulled her towards me, planting a kiss on her like it was the last thing I might do. “Let’s talk properly when this is over,” I said. “About us.” She got what I meant, and rewarded me with those dimples before I let her go and ran over to the closet in the corner of the room.

There it was, leaning against the shelves. A baseball bat. I’ve never watched baseball. Never played baseball. But everyone knows that’s not why you buy a baseball bat.

I grabbed it and headed to the door. “Lock this behind me,” I said to Carmen as I was leaving the room.

The front door had held surprisingly well, although the wooden frame had begun to chip, and it was beginning to give. It was only a matter of time. Unfortunately, it was sooner than I had hoped. I wanted to be in the lounge. The hallway was small, with not enough space to swing the bat but the door flew open in a shower of wooden chips before I made it.

Darren walked in, and I didn’t hesitate. Holding the bat out in front of me, I ran forward and pushed into him with all my strength. He turned at the last moment and put his arms up as I pushed him through into the lounge. We both went over the back of the sofa but he flipped me and I crashed into the coffee table on my back, my legs smashing into the TV, cutting off the newscaster.

I barely had a moment to soothe my poor back before I saw the machete flying down at me. I pushed out the bat again, hitting the underside of Darren’s arm and held it there. He was pushing down. I was pushing up. He was surprisingly strong for the gangly prat that he was but gravity was doing a lot of the heavy lifting here. I was at a disadvantage. I needed to get off my back but right now, I was just trying to survive. The knife edged closer to me as Darren put all his weight into it, pressing down with all that he had.

I grunted. He grunted. Spittle was flying from his gap-toothed mouth onto my face. I pushed with all I had. This was not the way I was going out. Not today. Not to this waste of oxygen. I knew exactly what kind of person he was from the day he moved in. I didn’t mind dying at the hands of someone with something about them. A special ops team. Maybe the girl with the impressive tattoos. But not to this wanker.

I strained and I strained and I could feel that I was moving his arm up, when suddenly the sound of breaking glass sounded out. My arms and the bat flew forwards with no resistance as Darren snarled and pulled his arm away. I flipped on my front and saw Carmen had cracked a vase on Darren’s head, but he had swiped at her and she let out a howl as the machete connected with her upper arm, blood trailing down.

Darren walked towards her. She was trapped between the dining table and the sofa, when he reached out and grabbed her by the throat, the machete in his other hand. She was still in the short t-shirt and knickers. She must have run out to try and help me. Why would she do that? Why? I wanted her to be safe. He only wanted me. Darren pushed her back by the throat, her back arching over the dining table as he held the machete up, ready to swing down.

I jumped up, bat in hand, and swung as hard as I could, knocking the side of Darren’s head. He let go of Carmen immediately, as he stumbled against the wall, the machete dropping from his hand. I advanced on him, bat ready to swing again, when a massive boom sounded out across the flat. It sounded like a sledgehammer smashing against corrugated steel. My left side and back felt like the sledgehammer had hit me.

I looked down at my side, the blue top seemed to be staining with something. Several small holes had ripped through my top. I turned around, looked up at the lounge door. Michelle was standing there. Darren’s mum – middle-aged, skin wrinkled like an aged apple and having eaten a few too many pizzas. She held a shotgun in her hands. A shotgun. Who the hell has a shotgun in the middle of London?

Then the shock wore off and the pain radiated through my side. Unwittingly, I put my hand against my ribs as if that would somehow help. It didn’t. Another boom rang out and the shotgun pellets tore through my chest as I went clattering against the dining table, my hand grasping at Carmen to my right. She screamed as I collapsed to the floor.

“Mum! We need him alive.”

“He was going to kill you,” Michelle replied.

I was on my back on the hardwood floor, one hand on my chest, the other holding the toppled chair on my left as if by holding onto it, I was holding onto my life. My breathing slowed down. Became shallow.

Carmen dropped to her knees beside me, cradling my head in one hand, the other pressed gently against my chest. Tears streamed down her face. She looked like she was saying something, but I couldn’t hear with the ringing in my ears. My eyes were fluttering open and shut.

Suddenly, the ringing stopped and I heard Carmen scream. I opened my eyes wide, doing my best to fight against the lethargy I was feeling. Darren had grabbed Carmen by the hair, dragged her off of me and flung her against the sofa.

“Stay there bitch. I’ll deal with you in a minute.”

I lifted my hand with what little strength I had and grasped at his throat.

“I’ll fucking kill you,” I managed to spit out in a splutter of blood and saliva.

He just laughed at me as he sat on my chest.

“They wanted you alive, but I guess that ain’t an option. Maybe we’ll get half the reward instead. All you had to do was open the door man. Now, I need to put you out of your misery.”

Then he stabbed me in the left side, where I’d been shot. I couldn’t even muster the strength to feel the pain. He stabbed me again and again and again and with every stab, I felt the life leaving me. All I could think was – not like this. Not at his hands. I managed to lift my head ever so slightly and take a final look at Carmen, back against the sofa, Michelle standing over her. She had her hands on her mouth, tears streaming down her rosy cheeks. Man, I’d never see those dimples again. Would never get to have that long-needed conversation with her.

I could feel it now. The long sleep settling in, my eyes fluttering, doing their best to stay awake but I couldn’t anymore. I couldn’t feel pain. I couldn’t feel anything. The only sensation I could make sense of was a gentle warmth where the gem had embedded itself in my forehead. Finally, my head rested back against the floor. Against my will, my eyes closed. I let myself sleep.

“System….initialising?” Carmen said as if she were figuring out how to speak English for the first time.

“You too?” I said, glancing in her direction. I didn’t need light to make out her features. Short, sexy, slim, with a smile to die for. She had smooth porcelain skin, and shoulder-length black hair framing a face that wasn’t as round as mine and certainly better to look at. Beneath her hazelnut-coloured eyes, she had these beautiful dimples when she smiled. Not that she was smiling now. In fact, it looked like she was frowning.

“What’s that?” she asked, pointing at me.

“What’s what?”

“You have something on your forehead.”

Instinctively, I put my hand against my forehead, feeling for the gem with my fingers. It was still there. Why wouldn’t it be? I turned my head up to the skies above and closed my eyes. This night just kept on getting better and better.

You might think I had more important things to worry about. More important things to figure out. You would be right, but my girl wasn’t the kind of girl to ask a question and be satisfied with the response, unless it was the response she thought it should be. Don’t ask. Logic doesn’t come into the equation. I knew she had only parked my response to why I was still up. I had hoped to get through the night without needing to explain myself to her. Man, I hadn’t even figured out a reasonable excuse.

Maybe that was my problem though. I hated explaining myself to others. I gave them enough information to stop them from bothering me further but maybe it just left them unsatisfied. Left them with too many questions. But seriously, how do you explain what’s happened tonight without it leaving a ton of questions? I mean, I have a load of questions myself. Having someone else in my ear about it wasn’t going to help.

And yet, I didn’t see any other option other than telling her the truth. For all our problems, she was my girlfriend. Had been for four years. I was the one she chose to stay with. Chose to spend the majority of her time with. I should be able to rely on her, right?

And so I told her the truth.

 

\*\*\*

 

“You’re telling me there’s a strange woman in cosplay and a head in our guestroom right now?”

I nodded, as I sucked on my finger – the one I’d cut with that woman’s blade earlier. The small wound, no bigger than a paper cut had opened up again during our argument. It had taken the best part of thirty minutes to get Carmen to this point, twenty-five of which had been spent with her telling me in no uncertain terms how disappointed she was in me returning to the gambling. It was an effort to hold down the desire to snap back and confront her about her own disloyalty, but it still wasn’t a subject I wanted to broach. I knew I would have to at some point, but I wasn’t ready to.

This is why I hated explaining myself though. I’d always found the more you talk, the more likely it was to land you in trouble. Or you’d veer off into tangents that had very little, if anything, to do with solving the problem at hand. It had taken a while to calm her down, but eventually, I’d been able to get to the actual meat of the story.

“I can show you if you’d like?” I replied.

“Sure. Seeing a decapitated head has been top of my bucket list for a long time.” English might not have been her first language but she had that British sarcasm down to a tee. After a pause, she said, “It’s got to be related.”

“It is, but I have no clue how. I don’t even know what this is,” I said, pointing at the gem. “I think she’ll know. I’m waiting for her to wake up. Maybe she’ll know how to remove it too and we can put this all behind us and move on.”

I sat there, elbow on the table, fingers rubbing at my head as if to erase the gem. It was like a smooth bruise right in the centre of my forehead, with itchy skin surrounding it. Carmen yawned, covering her mouth with the back of her hand, as she looked out over the city, looking like she was trying to put a jigsaw together without knowing what it looked like.

“Yo, Carmen,” a voice called out from the balcony next to ours. There was a gap, a couple of metres across between our balconies and the neighbour’s son, Darren, was leaning against the barrier on his side. He was naked, save for a pair of boxers, a slight paunch hanging out, at odds with his gangly frame.

My girlfriend rolled her eyes, turning her head to me. Darren had been trying to get in her pants since he and his mum had moved in a couple months back. This wasn’t the first time I’d seen him out on the balcony at this sort of time. He and his mother seemed to be night owls, sometimes hosting visitors late into the morning – fleeting visits; people who came, had a brief conversation and were on their way.

“What’s up, Darren?” I asked.

“Oh, River. Didn’t see you there,” the disappointment in his voice was palpable. “What do you think this is all about?”

Carmen took the opportunity to stand and shuffle inside. She was wearing a short t-shirt that barely stretched to her waist, her knickers visible and it was clear she was uncomfortable with Darren there. Before she stepped inside, she pointed at her own forehead with a look telling me to be careful. I doubted Darren could see the gem from where he was but I turned my head to look away from him in any case.

“You talking about the explosions?” I asked.

“And the blue screen,” Darren replied. “Did you get it? System initialising? What’s that about?”

So he saw the same thing as I did. It wasn’t something I wanted to get into with him though.

“No idea, mate,” I lied. Well, half-lied. Like Carmen said, it had to be related. The gem, the explosions, the System. How, was what I was struggling with. “Anyway, I think I’m gonna go to bed. And when I wake up, hopefully, this’ll all just be a bad dream.”

I didn’t give Darren the chance to respond before I followed Carmen inside and found her sitting cross-legged on the sofa, a candle lit on the coffee table between the TV and the couch. I plopped myself down next to her, put a hand on her bare thigh. She had silky smooth skin that just invited being stroked. She didn’t mind as she stared at the TV.

“It’s not working.”

“I’m only just getting started.”

“The TV, you idiot,” she said, looking at me with a coy smile. Man, I loved those dimples. “Nor is my phone.”

I took my own phone out of my pocket and sure enough, it was off and wouldn’t turn on.

“When you got the notification, did you get a blue screen too? With red lettering?”

“Yeah,” Carmen replied, stifling another yawn.

“Darren did too,” I said. “Gotta think others did as well. But d’you reckon it’s across the whole city?”

“I don’t know.”

She pulled her legs up onto the sofa, and bent them at the knees as she rested her head in my lap.

“Are your dad and brother still at your old place?”

“Probably. Why?”

“Should we check in on them? Make sure they’re alright? We could walk over in an hour or so.”

“Fuck, no. I wouldn’t check on those two if they were the last people on Earth.”

She looked up at me with wide eyes and tight lips. She knew how much I hated those two but I’d never told her why and she always found a way to bring them up. Trying to get me to reconcile. I mean, it wasn’t like she had a great relationship with her own parents. A phone call once or twice a month but that was it. She hadn’t been back to Hong Kong in two years. Maybe that’s why she kept trying to get me to reconcile. Maybe it would make her feel less guilty. What she didn’t understand was that I wasn’t joking. I wouldn’t check on them if they were the last two people on earth. Good riddance, in my opinion.

“Guess there’s nothing to do but wait,” she said, with another yawn.

“Well, there’s stuff we can do while we wait. I mean, you’re already in the right place.”

She laughed a tired laugh and with a murmur, said, “Maybe later.” She grabbed my arm and placed it across her chest, then put her hands beneath her head.

I was still in my clothes from earlier – tattered denim jeans and a navy blue polo top – and wished I had changed. “Let’s go to bed at least?”

“In a minute,” she whispered, already half-asleep. She had this uncanny ability to sleep whenever she wanted. It made me jealous.

I blew out the candle and leant my head back against the sofa, closing my own eyes as I thought back on the night’s events that had led to here. That’s what happens right, when the proverbial shit hits the fan. You always replayed every decision you made that led to the sequence of events that led to where you were now. I did anyway. I always wondered whether it was a specific decision, or whether each decision narrowed the options for decisions later that inevitably led to an undesirable outcome. But, in any case, I always came to the same conclusion.

I couldn’t do anything about my past decisions. Only use them to inform my future ones.

 

\*\*\*

 

It was the sound of the TV that woke me. I blinked several times. My head had rested into that awkward position of half my face on the back of the sofa, with the right side of my neck straining to keep it in place. I stretched out my neck as I noticed the room was bathed in the light of a spring day in London. Light that promised sun and rain and everything in-between.

I nudged Carmen awake and as she sat up, I grabbed the remote and changed the channel to the news, turning the sound up.

“…authorities are still trying to understand what happened overnight and the wider implications. Emergency services have been inundated with requests for help across the country and are under severe strain. The level of incidences are unprecedented, and beyond what emergency services were prepared for.

“As we understand it, this wasn’t isolated to the UK. Reports from across the globe suggest that every nation was attacked simultaneously with what experts are calling the most sophisticated EMP they have ever seen. Military experts have said that this is a technology that is not possible with our current understanding of science, and speculation has begun that this was an attack from outer space. For centuries, humans have wondered whether we were alone in the universe or not. Some are saying this is definitive proof that we aren’t.”

It showed the time in the corner of the screen. 9:04 am. Roughly six hours since we fell asleep, in my estimation.

“Now we know it’s worldwide and occurred for everyone,” Carmen said, still wiping the sleep from her eyes.

Then the TV went quiet. Not because it had turned off or anything like that but because the news anchor seemed to be reading something invisible in front of his face.

The blue screen appeared again in front of me and from the look on Carmen’s face, it had appeared for her too. Then a series of messages scrolled from bottom to top.

So here’s the situation. A colleague (not someone I’m close with) asked me out for coffee while I was distracted and stressed going to the bathroom, and I reflexively said yes. Later I realized he probably meant it as a date. The thing is... I really don’t want to go. He’s really not my type, and I’m just not interested — I also have a complicated situation going on. I don’t wanna just go on dates for pity. 

To make it more awkward, it’s his last day at our current workplace on Monday (he’s moving to a different location just across the street), and before he left for the weekend he said, “See you Monday,” like he’s expecting me to organise this coffee then. He also followed me on instagram prior to this (god knows how he found me) and i followed back bc it’d be awkward not to? But now I regret that also. 

Now I’m panicking a bit. I absolutely don’t want to go, but I also really struggle with turning people down face to face. I’m considering calling in sick just to avoid it, but I know I can’t avoid the conversation forever.

I don’t want to be rude, and I don’t want to out myself or explain too much. I just want to set a clear, respectful boundary.

How do I handle this in a way that’s firm but kind — especially if he brings it up in person Monday morning? I usually turn down people via chat if i have to, i’m not used to this 😭

I never touched it.  
I never asked.  
It just happened.

I stared at it for 11 minutes. I don’t remember breathing during that time. I probably didn’t.  
No one called.

It’s heavier than yesterday. Or I’m lighter.

I made coffee to cancel the sensation. The spoon followed.  
I didn’t stir.  
It did it for me.  
Clockwise.  
Too slow.

I set it down on the counter. It fell *up*.

I called a friend to tell them.  
The line crackled. They said, “You’re not supposed to talk about it.”  
I hadn’t told them what “it” was.

I licked the spoon.  
Not for taste. For dominance.  
It laughed. But only inside my gums.

I put it in the freezer for seven hours. When I opened the door, it was warm.  
The peas were afraid. I could tell by their spacing.

I buried it in the backyard next to that USB I don’t remember using.  
The dirt was already dug.  
I didn’t ask who did it. I just covered it gently.

This morning, it was on my pillow.  
Curved.  
Smiling.

I used it to eat yogurt. Just to see what would happen.  
The flavor was “apology.”

Anyway, I’m keeping it in my jacket pocket now.

I don’t answer anymore.

But about a year ago, my doctor told me to cut back on sugar and milk due to psoriasis flare-ups and a borderline HbA1c (5.8). I’m not someone who takes advice easily, but something clicked.

I used to snack on cookies and biscuits during anxious nights. Slowly, I swapped them out for fruits; guava, papaya, bananas. It wasn’t easy; fruits don’t give you that instant sugar hit. Even my niece complains now that I don’t keep snacks at home 😄

I cut down from 3 cups of tea/coffee a day to just 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening. My biggest change? Reducing rice. I love my white rice (been in Bangalore 20+ years), but over 6–8 months, I halved my portions and started eating cooled rice for its lower GI but increased the veggies.

Breakfast went from 3 chunks of puttu to 1, along with cherupayar curry and an omelette. No more fruit juices — I eat the whole fruit instead. I also gave up/ giving up my favorite vada-idli combo to only idlis and our deep-fried neipathal. The cravings don’t vanish overnight, but they fade.

The results? Down from 80kg to 72kg. My old pants barely stay up now,  holding off on buying new ones until I hit 65–68kg. More importantly, I feel younger. I can now walk 5km+ easily, something I struggled with in my 30s.

My friends say I look like a different person. And honestly? I *feel* like one too. Cutting sugar has been life-changing  more energy, better skin.

I used to feel awkward about not being into sports growing up, but now I just want to move, sweat, and try new things — whether it’s badminton, hiking, tennis, jogging, or even something casual like playing catch.

Why no one using this lifehack ?,"I’ve been thinking about radical solutions to homelessness and housing insecurity. What if every citizen in \[Country X\] contributed just **€1-3 per month** to a national housing fund? This concept I just can’t get out of my head.

For instance, Serbia — like many countries — has an ongoing problem with homelessness. According to some estimates, there are around **20,000 homeless people** living in Serbia today.

I started wondering… What if there was a simple, collective solution? Something not about waiting for the government or charities alone — but something we could do as a society.

# The idea is simple:

* Every **employed person** in Serbia contributes just **€3 to €5 per month**.
* This would run for **5 years**, like a national solidarity fund.

# Let’s break down the numbers:

* Serbia has approximatelly **2.9 million employed people**.
* **At €3 (*****pack of sigs*****) per month:**
   * €8.7 million collected monthly
   * €522 million over 5 years
* **At €5 (*****a cup of coffee*****) per month:**
   * €14.5 million monthly
   * €870 million over 5 years

The average cost of a basic apartment is around **€50,000** (or even cheaper if it’s purpose-built social housing — about **€30,000 per unit**).

# What does that mean?

* With €522–870 million, we could buy **10,000 to 17,000 apartments**.
* If we focus on building affordable social housing (€30k/unit), we could create **29,000 homes** — enough to house every homeless person in Serbia and still help other vulnerable groups (low-income families, single parents, people with disabilities).

# Is this actually realistic?

* €3–5 is practically the price of a coffee.
* Spread over time, the impact could be absolutely massive.
* **Finland** has shown that this type of approach — **Housing First** — works incredibly well, reducing homelessness to near zero.

# But obviously…

* There are challenges: political will, bureaucracy, logistics, corruption, land ownership, and public acceptance.
* But the numbers show it’s *technically possible*.

I’m **not an economist**, and I’m definitely **not a politician** — just a regular person thinking out loud.

But I would really love **not only to hear your opinions but also to get help in developing this concept further.**

Please, help me see all the **weak points**, all the **blind spots**, and how this idea could be **improved, refined, and turned into something real** — maybe in the form of a **crowdfunding project**, a **social program**, or even a **non-profit organization**.

To provide context, a customer comes over wanting a refill. I ring them up for a refill and my coworker pulls me to the side telling me that this customer never actually purchased a drink in the first place and that they regularly do this. I honestly assumed the customer purchased their drink while I was on break but I take a mental note and continue my tasks. The same customer leaves the store and comes back right around the time we're closing requesting another refill. I have an understanding that customers can get unlimited refills but... that's *during* their target visit. You cannot leave the store for x amount of minutes, hours, days, etc. and come back requesting a free drink whenever you feel like it. I tried explaining to the customer that they would need to purchase another drink but immediately I get cut off and told that they've worked at Starbucks/target/xyz and that they know the policy (which is nuts considering they didn't think about the policy when requesting that I give them the rest of product we didn't use upon shutting down 😗) The team lead for the night was in line waiting for their order to be taken so I try asking them for some backup regarding the policy and immediately I'm told to ""honor"" or give the drink free of charge.



At this point, I'm annoyed with both the customer and the team lead. With the customer, the constant abuse of this system is going to cost baristas their jobs for not following rules and the entire refill policy could be taken away ruining it for everyone. With the team lead, it doesn't look good to reward people who are cheating the system by giving them freebies essentially (especially on the behalf of not actually following the policy); what makes it even worse is that this is giving customers ammunition to argue and fight with employees when they're in the wrong. I promise y'all, I'm not trying to be snobby or a Karen 😭 I'm a college student and I can't afford to lose my job so I'm trying my best to avoid making any crucial mistakes that could get me terminated. I spoke with the same team lead and we go over the policy but I still have questions:



1. Let's say a customer orders a grande (medium) ice coffee, when they come back for a free refill, does it have to be that same size or can it be any size?

2. If a customer shops at a stand alone Starbucks location, are they able to come to an in-store location (target or any participating stores) and get a free refill?

3. I was made aware for the very first time that we have the option to discount the refill if the customer doesn't have the Starbucks app. My question is, how much do we charge for refills? or How much do we discount for refills?

4. If a customer comes over to buy a drink, can they immediately request a refill or do they actually need to walk around before asking for it? Or do they need to finish the drink before requesting another?

5. For drive ups, are customers able to walk in and request a refill?

I’m feeling a bit shaken and upside down right now, but I wanted to ask if anyone else here has experienced something similar.

Yesterday, I went to visit my older brother — someone I’d been estranged from for years, partly because of how my parents talked about him. Growing up, I was always told he was selfish, cruel, cold, dramatic — and I believed it. It wasn’t always said directly, but it was constant… implied, reinforced, and baked into how I saw him.

But yesterday? We sat down, had coffee, and talked properly for the first time in years. And we both had this moment of oh. We’d been manipulated against each other. We both thought the other had it easier. He said he thought I had “happy families” and didn’t realise I was just taking the Monday–Friday shifts.

We started comparing how our parents treated us and how similar the manipulation patterns were — same tactics, just different targets. It made me feel sick how much I recognised, like a script had been running my whole life and I’d never noticed.

Now, I’m the second estranged child. I’ve just gone no contact after something unforgivable was said to me. I’m realising now how much of my relationship with my brother was shaped by their narrative. And it hurts.

He said to me, “There’s life after them, and it is bright.” I haven’t stopped thinking about that since.

So I guess I’m wondering — has anyone else gone through this?
	•	Being the “less difficult one” until you’re not?
	•	Reconnecting with the sibling you were told to fear or resent?
	•	Realising your whole understanding of your family was built on manipulation?

How did you cope with the grief and the whiplash of it all?

Thank you in advance — I’m so grateful this space exists.

⸻

TL;DR: I’ve just gone no contact with my parents and reconnected with my estranged brother, who I was basically conditioned to see as the villain growing up. Turns out we were both manipulated into thinking the other had it easier, and comparing our experiences with our parents was incredibly validating and painful.

After it turned into a fight in some ways I told her i didn’t want to be friends and that it be hard for me to work together and best we take a break she was not happy about that. Being dumped so unexpectedly i was even more confused on her behavior.

Anyways i started drinking heavy the next day and did some cocaine. I reached out to her former best friend because idk why i guess i was so confused wanted answers.

Anyways she said some stuff then i said some stuff i probably shouldn’t have (some criticisms). Keep in mind this former best friend had no longer spoken in years she had mentioned no longer talking because shes a bad person, bad person being the former best friend.

We reconciled since then this was back in January. Anyways we had a dinner recently and the topic had come up. I lied to her and saying she reached out to me when it fact I did. I did offer would you like to see and she in fact said yes open your phone let me see. We were in a different country so i pretended the internet wasnt working and then she dropped it (or so i thought).

The next day at the airport I gave her my phone (forgot tbh why i did) while I went to buy her and me some coffee.

I return and she tells me she knows I lied and that she went through my phone and saw the messages from instagram.

My first thought was to be pissed she went through my phone but also I did lie. I told her this was a long time ago at this point (january and now being july) and that I was upset at the time.

She said she forgives me but didnt know if she could trust me after lying to her like that.

I've been quietly tinkering away in our garage (okay, it's actually a cramped co-working space) on something that started as a ""what if"" conversation over way too much coffee.

**The problem I am obsessing over:**  
Creating video ads with stunning VFX and CGI shouldn't require a film degree, a Hollywood budget, or selling your soul to expensive agencies. Yet here we are in 2025, and most of us are still stuck with basic stock footage while big brands get all the cool explosions, particle effects, and cinematic magic.

**What I am cooking up:**  
An autonomous AI platform that's honestly kind of scary-smart. Here's the wild part—you literally just:

1. Upload your product image and what the product is about
2. Tell us your Ad idea (or don't, our system figure it out dynamically)
3. Click once
4. Walk away

**Then our AI goes full detective mode:**

* Analyzes your brand DNA and visual identity
* Studies your ideal target audience (the ones who actually buy)
* Real Time Researches what VFX/CGI styles make your audience stop scrolling
* Reverse-engineers winning ads in your space in Real Time
* Crafts custom Dynamic CGI environments, particle effects, lighting, and cinematic sequences

**The result?** A hands-free, Hollywood-grade VFX/CGI video ad that looks like you hired a $5k production team.

**But here's the thing...**  
I am not trying to replace human creativity—I am trying to democratize the insane visual effects that only big brands could afford. Imagine your product floating in a cyberpunk cityscape, or exploding with particle effects, or existing in some impossible CGI world that perfectly speaks to your audience.

**Real talk—I need your perspective:**

* Ever wanted your product in an epic CGI scene but couldn't afford it?
* What's stopping you from using VFX/CGI in your marketing?
* If you could have ANY visual effect for your product, what would it be?

We're launching soon under our [InfographsAI](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLezJW8BdCQ/) platform, but honestly? Your feedback matters more than any launch timeline. I am building this for people like us—the ones who dream of cinematic ads but work with bootstrap budgets.

Drop your thoughts, roast our idea, share your wildest VFX dreams. I am here for all of it.

*P.S. - If this sounds interesting, i'd love to have you along for the journey. Building in public is scary but way more fun with the right community.*

The main issue I’m currently facing concerns the air conditioning system. It was refilled some time ago, and the high-pressure sensor was also replaced due to a leak. Everything seemed to be working properly again at that point.

However, I’m now experiencing a strange issue that my local garage unfortunately hasn’t been able to diagnose clearly. The problem is as follows:

When starting the car from cold (like in de morning of after work), the air conditioning works perfectly – just today I drove 200 km without any issues. But as soon as I switch off the car briefly after a drive (for example, when refueling and taking a coffee break), the air conditioning doesn’t work when restarting. The ECO light stays on, and the AC doesn’t engage. Only after the car has been turned off for an hour or more does everything work normally again on a cold start.

I’m a 46 (F) based in North York, currently going through a pretty painful breakup. I can still show up and laugh and function around people, but being alone right now is hard, especially on weekends like this.

I’m very normal (I promise). I work in corporate, I’m into beauty, health, wellness, fitness and I’m an extrovert. I’ve got two kids, but they’re with their dad this weekend, and I’m realizing post-breakup just how few people I have to lean on. Most of my close friends are married and caught up in family plans, which I totally get, but it’s left me feeling pretty alone lately.

So I figured I’d just ask if anyone else in their 40s is going through something similar and maybe up for a walk or a coffee? We can talk about the breakup or not talk about it at all. I’m open to either. I’m good with male or female company, but just to be clear, this would be completely platonic. Not in the headspace for anything else, just some human connection.

Just one week. I thought to myself, ""How bad could it be?""

Spoiler: it was awful.

But also oddly worth it. Here's what went down and what actually worked for me to make it through it with this cold turkey.

The First 3 Days: Withdrwal is Real

Headaches. Brain fog. Lack of motivation. My body was on strike. It wasn't physical and I was cranky, grumpy, and tired. The first morning without my coffee, I felt like I hadn't slept at all (even though I had). I used NOCAF app to calculate my daily streaks of no caffeine and cal/money savings as motivation.

Day 4-5: Sleep Improves, But Energy's Odd

Sleep was deeper sooner. I woke less often during the night, but getting out of bed was still like pulling a truck out. My energy wasn't ""high"" - but was steadier? Less bouncy, less rollercoaster. The post-lunch crash that I was once familiar with (and would attempt to alleviate with yet another caffeine boost) started to fade.

Day 6-9: More even, Clearer

By day 6, I was shaking out of my brain fog. I wasn't 100%, but I was feeling calmer. Less anxious. Focusing was coming back around, but not in a less forced, hyper caffeinated tunnel-vision sort of manner—not the tunnel vision I was used to.

Big Takeaway After 10 Days:

Caffeine had been masking my tiredness, not fixing it. Abstinence pushed me to get to the bottom of why I was so tired (horrible sleeping habits, perpetual stress, and horrible water habits). Streamlining those habits did more for my energy than any other double espresso could.

I don’t know yet if I’ll stay off caffeine completely - but after 10 days, I’m way more aware of my habits and energy levels. And honestly? That feels like a win.

We do customisations to suit your needs, shape or print design. We supply high-end as well as low-end, depending on your needs. Our prices are very competitive even compared with plastic products. We do also supply plastic products if that's what you need. Sugarcane, bamboo, kraft, plastic, etc.

We have recently entered the UAE market. Fully registered and established within UAE. We now import our products into UAE and KSA.

He paints 1 foot of gas conduit next to my meter. The vehicles spend the next 4 hours parked. It's an absolute brilliant waste.  A 3 man crew to paint!

Then a candle that responded to her voice. Jackie wants answers--but some patterns speak in whispers.,"A Quiet Whisper

Scene 1 – An awakening.

Jackie lay down on her new bed, soft in all the right ways. Not the tired, weak hug of a weary old mattress, but whole and warm. She looked around her new room, a fresh coat of paint lit warmly by her lamp. She smiled and imagined what lay ahead. A new bed, a new house, and a new life. Safe. She glowed in the warmth of the lamp as she thought of tomorrow—her future. She looked toward the lamp, her fingers brushing the switch, softer than a whisper. The lamp flicked off too easily. Had she even touched it? She smiled. Just her imagination… Then she returned to rest.  


The sun spilled into Jackie’s room, warming olive walls and dark wood. Squinting, Jackie could fool herself she’d lain in a forest. She was slow today—not lethargic, not anxious, but deliberate. A new day lay ahead, one to map and explore. She rose slowly, sunshine warming her body as she passed through it. As she approached the door, it softly clicked away from the latch. Jackie found it odd—a draft, she supposed. She pulled the door open and washed through it like the sun washed through her window. She trickled down the stairs deliberately, picking up which boards creaked and which boards held solid. An old house with new perspectives and new ideas. Jackie noted the boards—first, fifth, ninth. There was no intent to fix them, just to understand. She entered the kitchen like a breeze and saw a cup of coffee sitting on the counter. Steam slowly rose from the rose-colored cup in light wisps. The wind that moved Jackie seemed to falter. She waited in the threshold a moment longer than she might have. She knew she hadn’t made it, or… thought she hadn’t. So then, what of the mystery cup?

 

The cup was hot in her hands, an ember of recognition. Smelling the coffee, she brought the rim of the mug to her lips. Hot, bitter, exquisite. This wasn’t hers. She knew it by taste, and Jackie’s mind couldn’t let it go. Jackie was suspicious—but of what? Had someone broken in just to leave this behind? Still, she checked her doors. Locked. Steel cool from the morning. Protection. Protection from what, she wondered. She began to reach for the door when a warm current of air brushed her neck. She spun, but nothing was there—no trace of anybody or anything. While she searched the entry, she heard a faint click and turned to find the steel parted. The door was slightly ajar. The handle was warm.



 

Scene 2 – A Revelation

Jackie lay in her bed that night, feeling its unfamiliar but forgiving shape. The olive and wood accents had been lost to the darkness. She couldn’t quite understand why, but she dared not touch the lamp. Its dim silhouette lingered in the moonlit room. She closed her eyes to bring more darkness, but the lamp persisted. Her body was warm and comfortable, but her mind wouldn’t stop turning. Sleep found her, and she dreamt of the lamp.

 

Jackie woke—certain sleep would not return. Tension drained as calm trickled into her limbs. Olive and wood smiled at her in the warm light. Yawn. Stretch. Pause. Blackness and a dull moon were the portrait of her window. The lamp shone brightly, silently. Click. Darkness. Jackie was left in darkness while her heart pounded. “Oh my god,” she whimpered, chest heaving. A beat. A quiet moment. The light returned—slowly—gently warming the room. There was no click, no announcement, only the warm glow. Dimmer than before, but enough to stave off the darkness.

 

Scene 3 – A Breath

Sunshine, real and warm, shone through the window. The bedroom illuminated for no one. Jackie was already gone. Long before the sun rose, she had found her way back to the kitchen. Each tentative step freshly illuminated, as if she willed it, or maybe something else. Jackie now sat in the sunlit kitchen, pondering over her rose-colored cup. Her chin flat on the table, eyes tracing steam currents. Doubts cast aside, replaced with theory and speculation. Sane minds would reject most—all. Her mind looped much like the steam trails over the cup, so she followed them with her eyes, as her heart beat steadily.  
  
The steam of the mug wisped up and curled. Tendrils reaching and rising until they faded away. A flicker. A tendril reached oddly toward her, followed by the scent of coffee and warmth on her face. She did not flinch, she did not smile, she merely inhaled. Deep and slow, raising her torso and filling her with life and aroma. Her exhale washed the wisps away. She drank, not greedily but long and deep, like the answer lay at the bottom of the cup.



Scene 4 – A word

Legs drawn to her chest, Jackie sat in her reading chair. Elegant and refined, it cradled her while her hands held a book and her eyes remained still. The book was unimportant as her eyes slowly scanned the room. The eyes of her farthest ancestors seeking pattern and movement where none might exist. Jackie couldn’t believe it had come to this, but she knew she had to leap. She needed an answer.

“Hello,” she whispered into the still air. Quiet and ashamed. Nothing happened for a moment—then, a flicker. Her eyes darted to the small decorative candle on the shelf. Pink and plain, it sat atop the mantle—now lit for the first time. Jackie could only stare. The word “coincidence” was beginning to lose its meaning.  
  
Jackie held her book as her fingers turned white. Her eyes transfixed on the candle, as if their departure might extinguish it.

“What are you,” she breathed. She couldn’t believe she’d said the words, but as her doubts grew, the flame flickered away. Her heart skipped. A pang. A moment passed. Then she heard it. A faint shuffle from the bookshelf. She turned her gaze and saw a lone book sitting slightly ajar. She stood and found a well-worn copy of Shakespeare’s works.

“William,” she asked, more to herself than the room. Nothing seemed to happen. She couldn’t believe she was letting this happen, but she couldn’t ignore it.

“Richard,” she suggested, almost mocking herself for letting this go on so long.

“Edward,” she said more casually, as her mind eased into disbelief. She glanced back at the candle. Nothing. She let out a low breath—half laugh, half shame. Her eyes came back to the book—neatly in its place.  
  


Scene 5 – A candle

Jackie lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, tracing the patterns etched into the plaster. The smell of roses lifted off the pink candle and swirled around the room. The rug at her back was rough, but it shielded her from the hard wooden planks. Her eyes darted over the patterns, trying to draw meaning from them like hieroglyphs.

“Edward,” she called out. The little pink candle pulsed for a moment, just like it had done a dozen times that evening. Just a moment, just an extra flicker, but undeniable. She had tried other words even as she questioned her own sanity. So now she lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, wondering what it all meant—just like the patterns in the plaster. Sleep found her there on the floor, without ceremony or recognition.

A coldness crept over her legs. She tried to fight. Tried to shoo it away. But it persisted. It climbed. The house was black; olive turned to soot and wood to ash. The candle shimmered, distant. It flickered lightly in the black fog—so close she felt she could touch it, so distant she couldn’t bear the journey. The coldness had crept over her fingers. She feared they might seize. She swam through the black fog—it clung to her like tar. She tried to reach the candle, to feel its warmth. The fog closed around her, and the candle began to sputter. Jackie lay on the floor in a cold sweat. Awake. Safe. The windows were black. The room was lit by a tiny flame. The small pink candle lay gently by her body, so close she could touch it.

 

Scene 6 – A bath

Jackie carried the flame through the home. A warmth, far richer than the tiny flame could ever provide, pooled around her. It gave her light freely, dancing in her hands. It kept her safe, and she held it close—with reverence. She would not forget the clawing darkness. She would not forget the salving light.

She lay immersed in warm water and soft light. She was warmed through—her heart, her soul. If she closed her eyes, she could swear she felt the flame dancing across her skin. Weariness dissolved in water. Trouble evaporated in light. The water grew cold, but the candle never dimmed, never receded. Jackie left the water; what weariness remained dripped from her shimmering body. The candle shone on her and pressed light onto her body as her shadow danced behind her. A moment of joy—until the candle shattered to the ground. Jar broken, wax dented, flame… ruined. She wasn’t sure how it had happened—a flurry of dancing and a whip of the towel…

Suddenly, the world seemed to go black. Jackie froze. Panic rising. The overhead light began to buzz and flicker. Louder. Faster. The door unlatched and swung open. Jackie rushed through. Behind her, the glass exploded, raining into the departed room. She ran to the only place that had ever answered. As she approached the study the fire roared—eager and alive. She found its warmth and collapsed in front of it, naked, wet, terrified. As the flames devoured the logs the light touched her body—warmer now—but fear melted to clarity. She whipped her head to the hearth:  
“Edward?” she asked, breathless. The flame dimmed. Then roared—crackling, alive. Then it settled, quiet and steady.  
“I thought I’d lost you,” Jackie whispered, her voice trembling.



 

Scene 7 – An outburst

Jackie sat in her study, surrounded by candles. They radiated light into every corner of the house, burning out darkness like a quiet conflagration. The air swirled in the room, alive. It rose and washed over her in waves—relentless. Dedicated. Books were strewn across the study, as if the air had grabbed them like the tide. She’d tried everything. She’d tried every book. She wanted more. She called the name again, like a mantra.

“Edward,” she said, a plea lilting in her voice.

“Help me,” she whispered. The candles once again flared and settled. The fireplace crackled, then calmed.

“I need to know you can understand,” she said, her voice nearly breaking. The candles did not respond. Silence. Steady flame. She’d been at it longer than she’d admit, to herself or anyone else. The warmth soaked into her skin and seeped into her bones, but she wanted something deeper. The coffee every morning only brought curls of steam and a pleasant taste. The candles kept her safe and warm. She lacked something now—something that she didn’t want to name. The gravity was too great. She yearned for communion. Common ground.

“I will find a way, Edward,” she proclaimed again. The candles flared, just as they always had at the name. She welcomed the warmth—the acknowledgment—but she persisted.

“What is the answer?” she muttered to herself, frustration rising in her chest. She clenched her fists and pressed them to her forehead. She struck herself. And again. The candles flared brighter than ever, and the fire roared. Sustained. Jackie stared at the fireplace.

“Are you upset?” her voice faltered. The candles dimmed, then pulsed.

“Was that a yes?” she asked—probing, cautious. The flames pulsed.

“Edward… you reached out to me.” her voice tender, raw. The candles held steady, then dimmed, just faintly. She leapt to the floor, hands trembling.  
“Edward, I’m sorry for the candle,” Jackie said, her voice cracking, tears welling in her eyes. The candles wavered but held their low, dim flame.

“Can you forgive me?” Her voice rippled with soft sobs. The candles held steady. She waited. She thought an answer wouldn’t come. Then a faint, subtle pulse.



Scene 8 – A quiet whisper

Jackie sat in the center of the candles. She hadn’t moved. She didn’t want to lose the moment. She stared into the twinkling sea of candles. For the first time, it seemed they didn’t just light her face—they saw it. They witnessed her as she was, there in that moment. She suddenly felt shy—stripped bare. There were no questions left in her mind now. This was what she wanted. Her muscles ached, but she held her position, afraid that moving might end the communion. She reached for words, but they didn’t come.

Her mind raced. She knew that she had to say something. That moment was there, in her hands, but it was slipping away like grains of sand. The flames held their shape, dancing across her face in slow, rhythmic pulses. She wished she could pull this moment from time and live inside it a while longer. Each flame beat pressed against her skin, warming her. The wood crackled with the resonating energy. The air felt electric, swirling around the room, spinning and twisting. It made Jackie feel as if she were flying or falling—she couldn’t decide which.

She held her position—aching muscles and something deeper still. The flame beats hit her again and again. She could almost hear them. She could almost make out the rush and thump of flame rising and falling. The beats hit her in the chest. Her ribs quaked with the force. Was this her heartbeat or the flame? Her reality pressing into the flame—instead of combusting, it fused.

The drum beat of the flame on her ribs racked her body—until she thought she was going to crack open and spill herself on the floor. The pressure inside grew like the combusting gases in a bomb—until finally:

“Edward, I love you.” She didn’t yell. She didn’t beg. Jackie simply stated it to the room, and the candles hushed. The air died. The wind stopped. Stillness crept in. Jackie straightened, allowing her bones to shift for the first time in what felt like hours.  She sat up straight, staring into the sea of flickering candles. They were calm now, dim. She did not react. She just watched. A gentle breeze washed slowly through the room, cool and deliberate. The candles began to extinguish line by line around her. Was this the end? Jackie just watched, resolutely. 

At last, she was left alone in the room with only the dented and broken pink candle—placed in mourning, lit in reverence. The flame faltered until it, too, wisped a thin stream of smoke. 

Darkness. 

She closed her eyes and relaxed. The darkness encompassed her. Then—she felt it. The warmth returned. She opened her eyes to a room shining brighter than daylight, but there was no flame. She saw her shadow cast strongly on the wall in front of her. Then she felt the warmth she’d never known before, as a hand grasped hers.

“I love you too,” came a quiet whisper.

Super walkable, tons of chill spots, and enough variety that it feels like you’ve “done a lot” without being overwhelmed.

If you’re a dog person start your day at Berczy Park. It’s got the most hilarious dog fountain, and it’s a nice spot to grab a coffee and people-watch before the city gets moving.

I caught a Blue Jays game (literally every seat in the house is great), and you can walk to the stadium from a ton of neighborhoods. If you’re into history or just architecture, St. Lawrence Market and the Distillery District are beautiful to explore—less touristy if you go earlier in the morning.

Local tip: Skip the CN Tower unless you’re dying for the view. Instead, head to Trinity Bellwoods in the late afternoon with snacks or grab a drink at Bar Raval which has the coolest design and vibes.

1lnbyjk,https://v.redd.it/ghnts2r4lu9f1,"I built an AI that turns any product photo into a $5K Hollywood VFX/CGI ad with one click (300 seconds, zero skills required) - Need your brutal honest feedback","So... I've been quietly tinkering away in our garage (okay, it's actually a cramped co-working space) on something that started as a ""what if"" conversation over way too much coffee.

**The problem I am obsessing over:**  
Creating video ads with stunning VFX and CGI shouldn't require a film degree, a Hollywood budget, or selling your soul to expensive agencies. Yet here we are in 2025, and most of us are still stuck with basic stock footage while big brands get all the cool explosions, particle effects, and cinematic magic.

**What I am  cooking up:**  
An autonomous AI platform that's honestly kind of scary-smart. Here's the wild part—you literally just:

1. Upload your product image and what the product is about
2. Tell us your Ad idea (or don't, our system figure it out dynamically)
3. Click once
4. Walk away

**Then our AI goes full detective mode:**

* Analyzes your brand DNA and visual identity
* Studies your ideal target audience (the ones who actually buy)
* Real Time Researches what VFX/CGI styles make your audience stop scrolling
* Reverse-engineers winning ads in your space in Real Time
* Crafts custom Dynamic CGI environments, particle effects, lighting, and cinematic sequences

**The result?** A hands-free, Hollywood-grade VFX/CGI video ad that looks like you hired a $5k production team.

**But here's the thing...**  
I am not trying to replace human creativity—I am  trying to democratize the insane visual effects that only big brands could afford. Imagine your product floating in a cyberpunk cityscape, or exploding with particle effects, or existing in some impossible CGI world that perfectly speaks to your audience.

**Real talk—I need your perspective:**

* Ever wanted your product in an epic CGI scene but couldn't afford it?
* What's stopping you from using VFX/CGI in your marketing?
* If you could have ANY visual effect for your product, what would it be?

We're launching soon under our #InfographsAI platform, but honestly? Your feedback matters more than any launch timeline. I am building this for people like us—the ones who dream of cinematic ads but work with bootstrap budgets.

Drop your thoughts, roast our idea, share your wildest VFX dreams. I am here for all of it.

*P.S. - If this sounds interesting, i'd love to have you along for the journey. Building in public is scary but way more fun with the right community.*

Designed specifically for small offices or businesses, this model serves as a reliable caffeine companion—a necessity when juggling the chaos of daily work. The moment I brought it into my workspace, it became an instant favorite among coworkers, who appreciated its blend of functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Advantages**

- Brews four different cup sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 oz.).
- Includes a STRONG button for bolder flavor when needed.
- Quiet Brew Technology ensures minimal disturbance.
- Extra-large 96 oz. reservoir reduces the frequency of refilling.
- Simple, button-operated interface for ease of use.

[Check Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b08491k416/)

**Design and Features That Stand Out**

The sleek black finish of this coffee maker, along with its compact dimensions, sits comfortably on a kitchen counter or in a small office area without hogging too much space. The drip coffee machine design exudes a modern vibe while offering practical utility. Right off the bat, the extra-large 96 oz. water reservoir impressed me. I no longer had to make awkward trips to refill it during peak coffee hours—the feature truly optimized workflow in the coffee queue! What also pleasantly surprised me was the reusable filter type, which felt more eco-friendly than traditional disposable filters.

I loved how the button interface was straight to the point. Even the least tech-savvy person in the office couldn’t complain about figuring this one out. Oh, and let's not overlook the Quiet Brew Technology. It actually lived up to its promise, minimizing noise and sparing everyone from the curse of loud coffee maker sounds.

**Performance at Its Best**

In daily use, the brew time was just right—not painfully slow but not distractingly fast either. From my personal experience, the STRONG button deserves a chef’s kiss for mornings when regular coffee doesn’t cut it. It delivers a robust espresso-like flavor without the bitterness. I tested each of the four cup sizes, and their portion accuracy was spot-on, which I appreciated because imprecise servings can be an annoyance.

Speaking of diversity, the ability to accommodate K-Cup pods makes it a dream for coffee enthusiasts (and tea or hot cocoa lovers, thanks to the wide variety of 150 pod options!). This versatility brought more excitement to the office, because who wouldn’t want the option to switch drinks without needing multiple machines?

**Shortcomings**

- Slightly bulkier than standard single-serve makers.
- Cleaning the internal components requires effort.
- Limited to K-Cup pods for optimal use.
- Plastic components may not feel premium for the price range.

**Competing Products**

Comparing the Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker against alternatives sheds light on both its strengths and areas where competition heats up. Rival products like the Nespresso Essenza Mini offer a more compact and space-saving design but miss out on the larger water reservoir and Quiet Brew Technology. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single Serve excels with its dual functionality (ground coffee and K-Cups) and a lower cost; however, it lacks the elegance and office-appropriate aesthetic of the Keurig model.

Where this model solidifies its standing is its simplicity married with high capacity, making it ideal for busy environments. But it could trail against competitors with all-stainless-steel builds, as they might feel more durable for heavy-duty settings.

**Quality for Price**

Given the impressive features, this coffee maker offers notable value for office or small business use. It positions itself as a quality-over-quantity product, excelling in brewing flexibility, user-friendliness, and noise reduction. Competing machines might come with lower initial price tags, but they often compromise on key aspects like water reservoir size or specialty options such as the STRONG function. For what it includes, the cost feels proportionate—it’s not a budget steal, but it’s certainly a wise investment for smoother operations and a happy workforce fueled by caffeine.",1,1751194753.0,TestedAtHome,0,1.0,False

We saw osteopath first, who mentioned body tension, possibly from birth (forces assisted). Then, I sought IBCLC consult and they helped me with correcting my latch and watching me feed her - the whole feeding session lasted 40 minutes, where normally my bub would feed for 10 minutes on side and be done, that day she slept for 2h nap, but unfortunately I wasn’t able to repeat this success anymore. 

From 5th week of life - latch worsens, starts clicking/smacking. Same with bottle, lots of clicking and air swallowing. 

By 6th week paed appointment she dropped to 50th percentile but paed was not concerned as she grew in length. 

Screaming, arching back and inconsolable behaviour continued, explosive green poops 10 x day, dirty nappy for every change and small nappy rash around, possible reflux (acidic smell of spew), poor weight gain. I cut dairy and didn’t see much improvement. 

I saw LC at the hospital I gave birth and they gave me conflicting advice / said bub is lactose overload and it doesn’t seem like reflux or any intolerance to them, no oral examination. Told me to block feed to reduce my letdown and get bub to drink “hindmilk”.

I sought another IBCLC consultant (different IBCLC), they didn’t help with latch; told me bub was very unsettled, did oral examination and mentioned less than ideal sucking/cupping but no ties; examined dirty nappy and suggested intolerance. We deduced it could be eggs and eliminated it along with gluten/oats/coffee and beef. The next day there was immediate improvement with breast acceptance, fewer dirty nappies, but the poor latch continued. We closely monitored bub’s weight and I got concerned again and reached out to IBCLC number 1, another oral examination - they think high palate and clicking/loosing suction is concerning - they refered me to pediatric dentist (known for tongue ties but conservative approach and does not cut posterior ties) and we get lucky with appointment the next day. We learnt from him that there is nothing anatomically wrong with my bub and no ties present. Were a bit reliefed but still concerned what’s going on. 

We go back to osteo (different one), and they suggest the tongue function is less that ideal and should consider tongue tie release and refer us to different pediatric dentist (well known in to gue tie parents community, cuts all ties) , we did body work and are now waiting for assessment and release this week. 

Meanwhile my breast milk supply is dropping and I think I’m starving my baby cause she’s not able to draw milk efficiently. At this point I just want her to feed - regardless if it’s bottle or breast, but with bottle she’s compensating too much using jaw and swallows air and gets unsettled from too much gas screaming a lot while trying to pass wind 🤕 

I did a day of bottle feeding of expressed milk and now she’s starting to have a preference towards bottle. She’s gassy on bottle, hungry on breast due to inneficient sucking :(

Chapter 9

The crew was sat at the table, finishing the umpteenth bottle of wine with the few remaining locals that were still conscious, Antonio and Maria among them. At a certain point Kana had gotten up the titan-oak and fell asleep, curled into a ball on a large branch. Navrek was talking about agriculture with Antonio, debating the merits of the latest in gene-hanced crops, while Angela, Tuyaara and Maria giggled, reminiscing over embarrassing moments in their respective childhoods. Ivko, Willy and Neryh, had started getting Nirales up to speed in the basis of galactic society, slurring through half of their explanations.

“I travel half way across the galaxy, only to find out that, not only alien life is real, but that it can be sentient, and advanced, and the first thing I do with them is get wasted,” he said, accidentally spilling some wine on his shirt, when he failed to properly seal the fluid’s path up to his beak with his tentacles. “My government is going to be so confused…”

“Wouldn’t it be crazy if you haven’t actually travel that far, but in fact came from a couple systems over? Just outside the GC border.” Said Neryh, fidgeting with an olive with his front hands, before tossing it into his mouth.

“That’s not what happened, my friend,” Willy poured himself another glass of wine, leaning back in his chair. “Our visitor here was test flying a highly experimental worm-hole drive ship. If I’m not mistaken, the capsule you came on, was launched, or maybe more specifically, shot from some sort of longitudinal gravity emitter. The idea would have been to somehow bounce you, from where ever you’d go by reversing the polarity of the gravity beam, back to your home planet. Judging by the data and the slight micro-warping on the hull of the capsule, you’re faaaaar from home. Now, the question is, how far, and are we talking only spatially, or also temporally?”

Everyone remains silent for a while, the realization hitting them like a ton of bricks.

“With out the proper countermeasures in mass reduction, any gravity-based acceleration would’ve had some crazy time dilating effects.” Ivko took a big gulp of wine, and sighed heavily. “I don’t want to speculate, but…”

“I have a theory, but I’m way too drunk to properly articulate it right now, so instead, I’m going to go up to that big-ass tree over there, and take a nice long piss.” Willy punctured his proclamation by slamming his hands on the table, standing up and walking up to the tree.

“How ever bad your situation may be, I can promise you that we won’t rest until we’ve gotten to the bottom of this,” Ivko gave the newcomer a stern look, intention and purpose set in his eyes.

Nirales just remained silent. His drunken mind was trying to grapple with the enormity of his predicament. Not only was he an unknowingly vast number of lightyears away from home, but also possibly years into its relative future. For all intents and purposes, so much time has passed, that they might as well be extinct. A creeping feeling of dread began crawling over his body, making him shine a bright red. His breath hitched and quickened with dread, his vision began to blur and the world spun around him. He dropped his bowl of wine, bent over and brought his hands to his face.

“What if they’re all gone… what if I’m the last oakarat, what if…” he began pulsing a deep red light, shaking all over.

A pair of strong hands grabbed him by the shoulders.

“Hey, it’s ok. You’re ok.”

Nirales refocused his sight. Ivko’s blue eyes were staring directly into his. His face was a stone, a rigid bolder that helped him calm down, grounding him in the present, in the here and now.

“Don’t be afraid, my friend. Your people haven’t vanished. They are still out there, somewhere in the void.”

“How do you know… how can you be so sure…”

“Because sentient life is too sublime, to disappear before its time. There’s still much for you to know about our world, about how the universe works. Trust me on this one. Itt may seem hopeless now, but in the grand scheme of things, there’s no such thing as hopelessness.”

The human knelt before the oakarat, giving him a reassuring hug. The meaning of the gesture, coupled with his words, sunk deep into Nirales psyche, aided by the tireless efforts of the mycobacteria translating the meaning and intent of it all. He slowly began calming down, the red glow replaced with a calm green.

The crowd had stopped their conversations, setting their eyes on the scene. Navrek stood up, and brought his bulk over to the new comer, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

Willy had finished his business, returning to the gathering with Kana in tow, drowsily walking behind him. When they caught on to what happened, they too began reassuring the new comer.

“Who wants some breakfast?” Asked Maria, once Nirales had calmed down. “Some coffee and pastries will do us all some good.”

The crowd begun their trek towards the main Damasco manor, walking along the flagstone trail at a steady pace. Some of them were still keeping Nirales spirits high, reassuring him that everything was going to be fine.

The path wound gently through golden fields, where the grain whispered in time with a warm breeze, heavy with the scent of wildflowers that grew untamed between the stones. Beneath a deep blue sky, cloudless and proud, the flagstone trail rose in a soft incline toward the great Damasco manor —a colossus of rock-crete, two stories tall but stretched wide across the hilltop like a protective bulwark. The facade, earthen-toned with streaks of mineral veins that caught the light with quiet dignity, seemed carved from the hill itself rather than built upon it.

The main door, stood beneath a stout archway crowned by a lintel of titan-oak —darkened by generations of sun and wind. Over two meters tall, it loomed with the solid promise of ancestral permanence, steel hardware gleaming dully against the dense, living grain of the wood. Flanking the entrance were narrow arched windows, set deep into the wall like fortress slits —letting in the light without surrendering to the heat.

A covered gallery, supported by short, thick columns also of rock-crete, offered shade and pause before the threshold. The steps were broad, their stone polished smooth by centuries of footfalls, and a built-in bench along the wall invited travelers to sit and brush off the dust of the road. Off to the left, half-hidden behind a line of hardy shrubs, stood the much larger service gate, used only for the transport of food, raw materials, tools, or large equipment —functional and discreet.

Crossing the threshold, the change was immediate: from the vibrant, fragrant outer world to the cool, quiet embrace of the main atrium. The floor, made of dark stone slabs, still held the chill of the previous night. The walls —thick as fortress ramparts— were hand-plastered, with massive Titan Oak beams exposed overhead, spanning a ceiling nearly 7 meters high. From those beams hung warm hover-light-globes, suspended in the air like tamed fireflies. Their glow was soft, almost attuned to the mood of the space, bathing the room in hues of amber and bronze.

Along the walls, stone benches with coarse cushions sat below recessed shelves holding clay pitchers, hanging tools, and even a small family altar with a crucifix and a couple of lit candles. In one corner, a quiet stone fountain whispered as it chilled the water jugs before they were brought into the dining hall. The air smelled of wood, of stone, and of something harder to name —memory, perhaps.

The atrium was not just an entrance; it was a threshold between generations, the stone and wood heart, from which an old family traversed into corridors that branched into bedrooms, workshops, and gathering halls.

The new comers took a brief instant to gaze at the space around them, while the locals just moved past into a corridor that branched off to the left, towards the kitchen. The lively chatter of people could be heard, flowing like the water in the stone fountain —just another element in that portrait of atavist permanence.

“How much did this house cost?” wondered Nirales out loud.

“Well, you are going to have to define cost first, because something tells me we might have a different idea of what that concept means,” said Willy, patting his back.

Nirales didn’t answer. He understood that there were elements to the way things worked here he wasn’t privy to —at least for now.

Angela walked over to the altar in a brisk pace, crossed herself in front of it, and ran of to the kitchen. Her arrival was met with a choir of cheers that echoed through the atrium, galvanizing the remaining guests to follow suit.

The dining hall was joined to the kitchen by a wide, solid counter of rock-crete, clad in titan-oak, stained dark with oil and time. The whole space was huge, measuring about 120m². Around 40 to 50 of those were occupied by the kitchen itself.

The dining hall was even bigger; a single, monumental table of titan-oak dominated the room, long enough to seat over twenty, flanked by benches smooth from use and chairs with high backs, each unique. The stone floor carried the patina of hundreds of meals —drips, crumbs, stains of wine and joy. Along the walls, shelves held dried fruits in baskets, jars of preserved vegetables, and bundles of lavender tied with twine.

To say that the place was full of life, was an understatement. Children were running about the room —much to their parent’s annoyance and their grandparents’ delight. The smell of freshly baked pastries, coffee, bacon, eggs and fresh fruit, was ever present, wafting from the kitchen into the dining hall, invoking the spirit of hunger in everyone. 

Above the hustle and bustle, the hover-light-globes floated, arranged in circles above the table like constellations frozen mid-sway. On the far wall, a great timepiece swung —a heavy wooden pendulum ticking out slow, deliberate seconds, measuring the specific local flow of time.

“Aunt Angela! Aunt Angela! Aunt Angela!” screamed Lucia at the top of her lungs, excitement threatening to make her explode. “You came, you came, you came!”

The young girl jumped into her aunt’s embrace, squeezing her tightly, all the while squealing in childish delight. The last time she saw her, she was seven years old, but the fondness of her memories, had kept Angelas image burned in her mind.

Marco followed closely, at a leisurely pace, still trying to rub the tiredness from his eyes. He was just as happy to see his aunt, but was less vocal about it, preferring to greet her with a simple wave.

“Oh my God, you two have grown so big! I can’t believe it! Lucia, I can barely pick you up!”

“I wanted to come and say hello earlier, but I was so tired from staying awake the previous night, waiting for the new alien to come out, that I completely passed out from exhaustion!”

“Speaking of which, allow me to introduce you to someone,” said Angela, beckoning him over to meet the kids. “Nirales, this little bundle of hyperactivity is Lucia, and that pillar of stoicism there, is Marco. They’re Antonio’s and Maria’s children.”

He approached them, extending an arm and the full webbing on his digits. Lucias eyes widened in the most morbid of curious fascination, while Marco just observed him, nodding in mild interest.

“Hello, little ones,” he said in a friendly tone, shining a pulsating merry pink.

“WOOOOW! AUNT ANGELA, HE LOOKS LIKE CTHULHU! THAT’S SO COOL… AND WEIRD!” she jumped off of Angelas embrace, and approached the alien, unabashedly staring at his facial tentacles.

“I keep hearing this Cthu… what’s its name. Will someone be so kind to fill me in?” He asked, more confused than offended.

“I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you! Come, sit next to me.” She took him by the hand and led him to a seat next to hers at the table. 

“My, oh my. That’s one impressive kitchen,” said Neryh, peering into the room.

The kitchen was the warm soul of the house. The older women, worked tirelessly around the clock, fueled by their love towards their family, and the ancestral grandmotherly instinct to keep everyone nicely fed. Neryh walked in, and adopting his well-rehearsed regal pose, announced:

“Fair ladies, could I, perchance, be allowed to extend a hand in your duties, so as to alleviate your burden and show my appreciation for your boundless hospitality and generosity?”

The women looked at him and began laughing at the kaelarun’s excessive pomp.

“Fair ladies, he said!” Repeated one of them.

“We seem to have a charmer here. And he’s pretty handsome, for a chicken-feet,” said another, using the nick-name humans gave his kind, in reference to the way his frontal arms folded when in rest.

“Oh, my. This is so sudden, what will my husband say?” Added a third one, feigning embarrassment.

He stepped into the kitchen with confidence and, before starting to work his magic, he took a look at the tools available.

The morning sun poured in through the tall windows, casting golden shafts across the wide rock-crete floor and glinting off hanging copper ladles, clay pots, and ceramic jars with handwritten labels.

At the kitchen’s heart stood the great thermal oven —arched like a bread chapel, its domed vault, clad in scorched red brick and bands of blackened iron. Though it burned no wood, its heat was deep and true. Powered by a silent thermal core, it could roast meat with crusted skin and soft centers, or bake crunchy thin pizzas, trays of pastries, crusty loaves, and delicate sponge cakes with the same mastery, in a fraction of the time, thanks to its pressurizable chamber.

Against the back wall, flanked by two open shelves filled with herbs and tins, sat the pasteurizer: a blocky but elegant piece of steel-ceramic engineering, capable of processing up to ten liters of milk in one go, into a myriad of different dairy products. It hummed faintly, low and steady, as it heated and stirred and pressed, slowly shaping time into cheesy goodness. Nearby, ropes of drying sausages hung in a narrow, well-ventilated chamber, their skins taut and peppered with white bloom.

The fridge stood like a sentinel in one corner —tall, chrome-faced, with both front and side access. Its shelves held clay bowls sealed with wax and linen, smoked fish, vegetables in glass, and the occasional chilled bottle of fruit liquor.

A big and heavy sink, carved from dark grey stone, sat beneath a window. The handles were brass, worn smooth from years of service. Above, suspended from titan-oak beams, floated the familiar hover-light-globes.

Having seen the tools at his disposal, he began lending a hand —unintrusive at first, but as his skill became more and more apparent, the women watched on, enraptured by his dexterity. 

Angela popped in, and quietly walked over to one of the older ladies and said:

“Nona!”

Startled, the old lady turned around, and when she saw who it was, she gave her a big hug. Angela’s grandmother was in her late-nineties, but was so full of vim and vigor that one would say she was in her forties. She had her luscious white hair, tied in a long braid that hanged down her back, and was clad in the same simple yet elegant country attire.

“Oh, my baby is home!” She parted from her, holding her at arm’s length. “Why haven’t you called?”

“Oh, come on… It’s the whole relative time business. I didn’t know it had been that long,” said Angela apologetically.

“Don’t play silly with me, girl. I might be old, but I’m not stupid, I know how space time works.” The old lady frowned at her, immediately deflating when Angela gave her another hug.

“She is right Angela. You should have called,” chimed Neryh from the stove, sweat gathering on his turquoise forehead. He had tied his mane in a pony tail, and was busy working his culinary magic.

Angela scowled at him.

“Don’t look at him like that, he’s right. It wouldn’t kill you to send a word or two.”

“Where is grampa?” She asked changing the subject.

“Probably working on the machines. He got up before the crack of dawn, as always, and has been in the maintenance bay since. I tried calling him, but he’s probably lost in his work. It’s amazing how alike you two are.”

“I’ll try giving him a call.”

Meanwhile, the rest of the group sat at the table. Fresh pots of coffee were available for everyone, on top of milk at various temperatures, piles of fresh pastries, fruit, cheese and cured meat.

“I hope no one minds if we dig in. One tends to build quite an appetite from such intensive work,” said Ivko.

“Absolutely. Drinking all your wine was tough work, you know,” quipped Willy, getting a big juicy peach, after pouring himself a mug of coffee. 

Kana, for her part, slumped into the chair and rested her head on her folded arms.

“Sweetheart, what’s wrong?” Asked Maria, looking at her with concern.

“Her circadian rhythm is utterly off balance,” said Tuyaara, stroking the young seyalthra’s train. “So much sun makes her kind very tired. I mean, we’ve all been awake already for close to thirty-two hours, and aren’t far behind her. We’ll rest as soon as we return. We just needed to synchronize our sleeping schedules.”

“We could probably keep going for another couple of hours before exhaustion begins taking its toll on us,” said Willy, taking another messy bite from his peach.

“I’ll call the captain to let him know we are ready to leave.” Ivko took out his PIT and begun typing. “Also, we’re going to need to tow Nirales’ shuttle with us.”

“You can take some of our excess harvest as well,” said Antonio from across the table. “We’ve got so much grain and hay than we know what to do with. You’ll probably find better use for it.”

“Much obliged,” said Ivko, rising his coffee mug in approval.

“I’ll tell the boys to bring it out.”

Meanwhile, Navrek was playing with some of the children, carrying them around on his massive shoulders and running around, to their absolute delight.

“Mister, how did you get so big?” Asked a little boy.

“I never said no to a meal, or a chore. You need to stay active, little ones, lest you’ll be trapped by your shell. That’s an old saying of my people.” Navrek’s antennas flickered a couple of times as he made a deep buzzing noise to simulate the vibration of levitation.

“Kids! Get down from there! Stop taking advantage of our guest’s kindness!” Bemoaned a woman, probably their mother.

“It’s no bother, ma’am.”

“Trust me, these little devils will end up driving you insane if you let them,” said the mother.

Navrek put them gently on the ground, and she sent them of to do their chores, not before saying goodbye to the nokaltorun.

“You seem to get along with them pretty well. You’ve got kids of your own?”

Navrek didn’t answer for a short second, briefly twitching his antenna.

“Yeah… Something like that…”

At that very moment, Neryh came out of the kitchen, carrying a plate of pastries on each hand, and a tray of something resembling scrambled eggs with potatoes on his front hands.

“Just in case you were getting hungry… or hungrier,” he said laying the dishes on the table.

\*\*\*

It didn’t take them long to make short work of the food, happily chatting the morning away.

By the time Yupgo returned with the shuttle, they were about done. He landed close to the intersecting paths in front of the manor. A distance from him, a big hover-truck appeared, carrying the shuttle, while several others, from the other end of the path, approached hauling a massive stack of crates. Yupgo stared at the approaching convoy, wondering what was all this about.

“Angela, why am I being greeted by a small convoy of vehicles?” Said Yupgo over his PIT.

“Good morning, Captain!” Came her chipper voice. “Did you sleep well?”

“Answers first, pleasantries after.”

“It’s just some harvests they saw fit to give us, don’t worry about it. Make shure to prep the cargo bay door. We’ll be storing the pod there.”

Yupgo took in a deep breath.

“Even when drunk…” he muttered to himself, concluding inwardly, *you manage to pull shit like this*.

 By the time the vehicles came about, the crew were giving their heartfelt farewells to the Damasco family, embracing one another, as if they were old friends, promising to visit again when the opportunity presented itself.

From one of the trucks, a big, burly old man stepped out. He was built like a brick house, with hands like hydraulic presses, clad in the typical local linen-and-cotton attire. He looked at the crowd, seemingly searching for someone. Suddenly, his eyes locked on, and he bellowed:

“What a sight for these old, sore eyes!”

His booming voice carried such might that everyone gathered turned their heads in unison.

Angela immediately turned toward the voice the second she recognized it.

“Nono!” she cried, running toward her grandfather as fast as she could before jumping into his embrace.

“I just heard you’d arrived yesterday. I’m sorry I couldn’t greet you properly then,” he said, his tone remorseful, tinged with sincere sadness. “I just get so lost in what I’m doing that I lose all sense of reality.”

“Don’t worry about it. I should’ve called you, but with the new arrival and all the drinking…” she trailed off.

They were both painfully aware of how absent-minded they were and decided to leave it at that.

Their resemblance was uncanny. Angela looked like a gender-bent, aged-down version of the old man: the same skin tone, amber eyes, chestnut hair, and even the way they smiled was identical. But their similarities didn’t end there —they also shared a scatterbrained nature and an easygoing approach to life.

“Anyway… you’re looking good, kiddo! I see space life suits you. You happy up there? Is your crew nice?”

“They’re the best,” she paused briefly. “I mean… I only met them about a day ago, but we get along pretty well. As for the Gardenworlders… the captain is pretty nice —not at all a softie…”

Her grandfather narrowed his eyes. Softies was the term he and many other Deathworlders used to refer to Gardenworlders —derisive and descriptive in equal measure. For many, it was more than a mere insult; it was a warning about the weakness of the Gardenworlders’ character.

“Now listen here, girl. Do your duty, be kind, smile and nod along—but by God, do not get involved in any of their business. You hear me?”

His voice was low but firm. He shared the sentiment of many Deathworlders who chose to remain grounded, steering clear of the harsh path of the Order. He didn’t trust the *softies*. Not one bit.

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing,” Angela smiled, giving him another hug. “Besides, I’m a big girl now.”

“That’s a load of bullshit, and you know it,” he said with a mischievous glint in his eye. “For as long as I’m alive, you’ll be that wide-eyed little hellion with her head in the clouds.”

He stroked her cheek tenderly before hugging her and kissing her forehead.

\*\*\*

Once they grav-tethered Nirales’ pod to the shuttle, the went about loading the crates.

“We’re going to have to do two trips,” said Ivko after doing some calculations. “If we load the shuttle to the brim, and we leave enough room for us standing up, with the captain piloting, there’d be enough room for both the remaining crates, and the rest of the crew. It will be a tight squeeze though.”

“Yeah…” said Willy, trying to find a flaw in his math and failing. “It shouldn’t take us too long to unload it all once we’re aboard. The question is, who will fly it back down?”

“Rock, paper, scissors?” Suggested Ivko.

They spent the following hours loading the crates, flying up to the ship, unloading them, and coming back for the rest. By the time it was all done, exhaustion had just about wiped everyone out. Kana didn’t even wait to return to the ship to fall asleep—instead, taking advantage of her nimble body, she squeezed herself between a couple of crate piles and passed out, folded at odd angles.

As for Angela, her farewell was the last thing to wrap up, and it ended up taking longer than the entire loading and unloading process.

However, after a grueling amount of time, the job was finally done. The pod was safely secured in the cargo bay, along with the crates, and eventually, the Deathworlder crew went in unison to sleep, getting a well-deserved rest.

**How Much Should Gen Z Save From Each Paycheck in 2025?**

Saving money from your paycheck in 2025 feels like trying to pour water into a cracked mug. Rent’s up. Groceries feel like luxury items. And TikTok keeps telling you to “romanticize your life,” while your bank account says, “Maybe next week.”

But here’s the truth nobody’s glamorizing: If you’re in your 20s, renting, and watching half your paycheck vanish by the 5th of the month-you’re not alone. You’re just living through the most expensive entry-level adulthood in decades.

The good news? There’s still a way to save. Even if your rent's ridiculous. Even if your income isn’t what career day promised. This blueprint will show you exactly *how much* to save from each paycheck-and how to actually pull it off without quitting your lifestyle cold turkey.

Let’s start with the part that messes with all of us: **how much should you** ***actually*** **be saving in 2025?**

# What percentage of income should Gen Z renters save monthly?

Here’s the classic advice you’ve probably seen in every Instagram carousel: “Save 20% of your paycheck.”

It’s decent. But for most Gen Z renters, especially in cities, it’s not reality-it’s math cosplay.

According to the **Bureau of Labor Statistics**, the *median weekly income* for 20–24-year-olds in 2025 is **$693**, or roughly **$2,772/month** before taxes. Factor in rent, groceries, transit, and a couple impulse buys at Target-and that 20% starts shrinking fast.

That’s why financial planners now say: if you’re renting and making less than $45K/year, aiming for **10–15% in savings** is a solid starting point. Not perfect. Not viral-worthy. Just doable.

If your take-home pay is around $2,200/month, that’s **$220–$330/month**. Enough to build an emergency fund over time, not so much that it wrecks your mental health.

Real talk: “Saving 10% consistently for a year is more powerful than saving 20% for one month and quitting.” - *Ramit Sethi, “I Will Teach You to Be Rich,” Chapter 3*

**Is 20% savings realistic on an average Gen Z income?**

It can be-but not without trade-offs.

The real flex in 2025 isn’t saving 20%. It’s being honest about what it takes to do it. For many Gen Zers, especially those in high-cost cities like Austin, Seattle, or NYC, rent eats up **40–50% of take-home pay**.

You can still hit 20%, but it usually requires:

* Living with roommates (even when you’d rather not)  
* Cutting weekend splurges (yes, even Uber Comforts)  
* Using side hustles to boost income (think: freelance design, tutoring, UGC, etc.)  

For example, if you're making $3,200/month after taxes and rent is $1,400, you’ve got $1,800 left. Saving 20% means putting away $640/month-realistic *only* if you lock in a spending cap on food, streaming, rideshares, and avoid “soft life” temptation spirals.

Still, many Gen Zers make it happen through what personal finance coach Berna Anat calls “value-based budgeting”-prioritizing joy over junk.

“You don’t need to be a minimalist. You need to stop paying for stuff that doesn’t matter to *you*.” - *Berna Anat, “Money Out Loud,” Chapter 5*

**Saving on minimum wage vs salaried income: what’s achievable?**

Let’s break this down with real 2025 numbers.

If you’re on **minimum wage**, which now averages **$9–$15/hour** depending on your state, full-time pay lands between **$1,600–$2,600/month pre-tax**. After rent, food, and commuting, you might be left with just **$100–$200 to save**, max.

And that’s okay.

Here’s what matters:

* Consistency > size of savings  
* Use auto-transfer to build the habit (even if it’s just $20/week)  
* Build toward 1 month of emergency expenses, not 6 all at once  

If you're salaried-say, $50K/year (\~$3,400/month take-home)-you’ve got more room to maneuver. You can start with 10%, then stair-step to 15–20% by trimming autopay traps or negotiating bills.

Pro tip: Use your **raises and refunds** (like tax returns or bonuses) as turbo savings moments. They're outside your monthly budget, so stashing them doesn’t feel like a loss.

**How to calculate savings goals based on rent, income, and expenses**

Here’s a dead-simple formula to reverse-engineer your savings target:

**(Monthly Take-Home Pay) – (Rent + Fixed Expenses + Lifestyle Costs) = Potential Savings**

Example:

* Take-home: $2,800  
* Rent: $1,200  
* Fixed: $800 (groceries, phone, WiFi, subscriptions, transit)  
* Lifestyle: $400 (restaurants, gifts, clothes)  

**Leftover: $400 → That’s your savings runway.**

Now split that:

* $200 emergency fund  
* $100 rent buffer (next month)  
* $100 personal goal (travel, investments, future move-out fund)  

Knowing your “runway” keeps you grounded-and flexible. Some months will be tighter. Others will feel like a win.

**Book insight: The power of starting small, consistently**

“It’s not about saving more. It’s about saving first.” - *James Clear, “Atomic Habits,” Chapter 1*

Building wealth in your 20s isn’t a race-it’s a habit loop. Every $5 saved before you open TikTok is a vote for your future self.

# Rent Affordability Rules Gen Z Must Know

If you’ve ever looked at your rent, then looked at your bank balance, and genuinely thought, *“How is anyone affording this without selling a kidney?”*\-you’re not crazy. You’re just renting in 2025.

The rent struggle is real, but so are the numbers behind it. Let’s unpack what “affordable rent” even means anymore-and whether those old-school budgeting rules still hold up in a world where your 300 sq ft studio costs more than your parents' first mortgage.

**What is the 30% rent rule and is it still relevant in 2025?**

The “30% rule” has been around forever. The idea: you shouldn’t spend more than 30% of your *gross income* (pre-tax) on rent. Simple, clean, and... wildly outdated if you're living anywhere near a city with decent WiFi.

Let’s reality-check it with 2025 data. According to the latest **U.S. Census** and **BLS housing data**, median rent for Gen Z renters across the country has climbed to **$1,317/month**\-and that’s a blended average. In metro areas like L.A., New York, or Miami, it’s closer to **$1,900–$2,300** for a one-bedroom.

So what does that mean for you?

If you’re making $45K/year ($3,750/month gross), the 30% rule would give you a “safe” rent cap of **$1,125/month**. That’s...not happening in most places without roommates or a major compromise.

That’s why today’s financial planners lean on something more flexible: **the “survival ratio”**\-how much rent you can pay while still being able to *live* and *save*, not just exist.

Sometimes that means going above 30%, as long as the rest of your budget adjusts. Other times, it means staying below that mark to create room for student loan payments, savings, or mental health splurges like therapy or travel.

The 30% rule isn’t dead. But in 2025? It’s more like a vibe check than a hard limit.

**How to know if you're rent-burdened: monthly rent vs take-home pay**

Here's the phrase you need to know: **rent-burdened**. You’re considered rent-burdened if more than **30% of your** ***take-home*** **pay** goes toward rent. Not gross income-net. After taxes.

Let’s put this into context.

Say you’re clearing **$2,600/month after taxes** and your rent is **$1,100**. That’s **42% of your take-home**. You’re officially in the red zone.

Now, it doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong. It just means your margin for error is smaller. One missed paycheck, one unexpected $300 vet bill, and you’re dipping into savings (if you have any).

This is why calculating your **rent-to-income ratio** based on *what actually hits your account* is so much more helpful than using pre-tax numbers. It shows you the truth of what you can afford-not just what a landlord says you qualify for.

If your rent is above 40% of your take-home, and you’re not saving at least 5–10% of your income monthly, that’s your signal to reassess-either by increasing income or cutting back elsewhere.

**How rising rent in urban areas affects your paycheck savings**

Urban rent inflation is hitting Gen Z renters harder than any other generation. Why? Because you’re entering the market at its peak-without the safety net of home equity, family wealth, or ultra-low 3% mortgage rates.

In cities like Atlanta, Dallas, or Denver, rents rose **6–9% in the last year alone**, according to Zillow’s 2025 market report. In coastal cities? Even worse.

The impact is simple: the more your rent eats up, the less room you have to build a financial buffer. And that’s a problem, because every dollar you’re not saving is a dollar you can’t use to:

* Leave a toxic job  
* Move out of a bad living situation  
* Escape paycheck-to-paycheck stress  

So even if city life feels worth it for now, you need a game plan. Maybe that’s renting further out and commuting in. Maybe it’s negotiating your lease renewal or asking for rent concessions (yes, that’s still a thing in 2025). Or maybe it’s putting off solo living until your income catches up.

Bottom line: You can’t fight rent inflation alone, but you *can* fight it with strategy.

**Breaking down rent-to-income ratio by U.S. region for Gen Z renters**

Let’s zoom out. Your rent struggles aren’t just personal-they’re regional.

Here’s a rough snapshot of **rent-to-income ratios** Gen Z is facing across the U.S. in 2025, based on a mix of **BLS**, **Zillow**, and **Pew Research** data:

* **West Coast (L.A., San Francisco, Seattle)**: Avg rent-to-income ratio is **45–55%**  
* **East Coast (NYC, Boston, D.C.)**: **48–60%**  
* **Midwest (Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis)**: **30–40%**  
* **South (Atlanta, Dallas, Miami)**: **35–50%**  
* **Mountain States (Denver, Salt Lake City)**: **40–50%**  
* **Suburban/small town Gen Z renters**: **25–35%**, with better shot at savings  

This means where you live is a *direct factor* in whether you can save from your paycheck. It’s not just about budgeting harder-it’s about knowing what your environment demands.

The takeaway? High rent isn’t your fault, but if you stay somewhere rent-burdened too long without a plan, your finances will feel like a treadmill-working hard, getting nowhere.

**Book insight: Rent isn’t just a number-it’s a lifestyle multiplier**

“Fixed costs shape your financial reality more than any budget category. Rent is the first domino.” - *Morgan Housel, “The Psychology of Money,” Chapter 11*

Your rent decision isn’t just about square footage or city views. It determines what kind of life you’re able to build around it. Choose that number like your future depends on it-because it does.

# Budgeting Strategies to Build Savings on Any Paycheck

Here’s the uncomfortable truth nobody puts on those “This is your sign to save!” Pinterest quotes: *Budgeting when you’re broke hits different.*

When your paycheck vanishes before the 15th and your “treat yourself” moment is ordering groceries instead of instant noodles, traditional advice like *“spend less than you earn”* feels wildly unhelpful.

But the good news? There are budgeting strategies that actually *work* in 2025-for renters, for part-time giggers, for people living on coffee, ambition, and just enough WiFi to survive.

Let’s rebuild your budget blueprint from the ground up-no judgment, no jargon, just real talk.

**The 50/30/20 rule explained for Gen Z renters**

This rule gets tossed around a lot on Reddit threads and finance YouTube, but here’s what it *actually* means:

* **50% for needs**: rent, groceries, utilities, minimum loan payments  
* **30% for wants**: eating out, subscriptions, travel, dating  
* **20% for savings or debt payoff**  

Clean math, right? But if you’re in a city where rent alone eats up 40–50% of your income, this rule can feel like a personal attack.

Still, there’s value here-not in the exact percentages, but in the *categories*.

The goal isn’t to hit these numbers perfectly. The goal is to **see where your money actually lives**, so you can adjust from there. Maybe your version looks more like 60/25/15. That’s fine. The structure is flexible.

A 25-year-old in Atlanta might spend less on housing but more on car insurance. A 23-year-old in Brooklyn might be blowing past that “wants” category every weekend just trying to feel something after work.

The rule works when you use it as a compass, not a commandment.

**Zero-based budgeting vs envelope method: which works best in 2025?**

Let’s break down these two OG budgeting methods-both of which are having a quiet comeback in Gen Z finance TikTok circles.

**Zero-based budgeting** is when you give *every single dollar* a job. If you make $2,700/month, every dollar is assigned-rent, savings, coffee, even the $15 monthly donation you forgot you still give to your friend’s failed Kickstarter. At the end, your budget should hit zero-not because you're broke, but because your money is fully accounted for.

This method works incredibly well for freelancers, side hustlers, or anyone whose income changes monthly. It forces you to be intentional-and honest.

The **envelope method** is its analog cousin. You split your spending into digital “envelopes” (or use actual cash envelopes if you’re that level of committed), and once the envelope’s empty, that category’s cut off. No take-backs.

In 2025, apps like **Goodbudget** and **YNAB** (You Need a Budget) have basically turned this method into a science. Some Gen Z renters even use split debit cards to mimic the envelope method-rent money goes on one card, spending money on another.

If you find yourself overdrafting by accident or just feeling lost in your spending, envelopes can add clarity fast. But if you’re juggling multiple income sources, **zero-based budgeting** gives you the edge.

Personally, zero-based changed the game for me. I used to let leftover money drift into random spending-takeout, random ASOS hauls, you name it. Now, I assign *everything* the second I get paid. It’s not restrictive-it’s freeing.

**How to automate savings with direct deposit and banking apps**

If you have to *remember* to save, it probably won’t happen.

Automation is how you win this game-even if you’re only moving $25 at a time. Most mobile banks in 2025 let you split your paycheck into multiple buckets as soon as it lands.

That means you can:

* Send 90% to your checking (for bills and everyday spending)  
* Auto-transfer 5% to a high-yield savings account  
* Auto-route 5% into an emergency or goal-based fund  

Apps like **Chime**, **Ally**, and **SoFi** let you do this within minutes. Some, like **Copilot** or **Rocket Money**, even round up your purchases and stash the change-digital piggy bank style.

What this does is remove *willpower* from the equation. And when you’re busy, stressed, or impulsively ordering sushi because your day was trash, automation keeps your savings from getting canceled by emotion.

Think of automation as the financial version of brushing your teeth. You don’t overthink it-you just do it every day, and over time, your smile (and your savings) get healthier.

**Savings buckets every Gen Z renter should create (emergency, rent, fun)**

One savings account is fine. But if you’ve ever dipped into your rent money for a weekend trip or some “wellness” retail therapy-you know that boundaries matter.

That’s where **savings buckets** come in.

Divide your savings into specific categories with specific jobs:

* Emergency fund: car repair, medical, job loss  
* Rent buffer: 1 extra month’s rent saved up in case of delays or income gaps  
* Fun fund: travel, splurges, birthdays, random dopamine needs  

You can do this inside most banks now (Ally, Capital One, and Revolut all offer “goal” features), or manually across different accounts. Just label them clearly and pretend they don’t exist until they’re needed.

In my own setup, I name my buckets ridiculous things to make them feel more human. My emergency fund is called “Oh No.” My rent buffer is “No Landlord Stress.” My travel fund is “Outside Energy.”

That naming trick? It weirdly makes me respect the money more.

**Using side hustles to boost your monthly savings rate**

Sometimes cutting costs just doesn’t cut it.

If you’ve squeezed your budget as far as it’ll go and there’s still nothing left to save, the answer isn’t to hustle harder-it’s to hustle smarter.

In 2025, Gen Z’s most effective savings tool isn’t a spreadsheet-it’s a side income stream. Whether it's UGC content, tutoring on SuperProf, Notion template sales, virtual assistant gigs, or microtasking with platforms like Swagbucks and UserTesting-small side jobs can stack up fast.

If you pull in even $300/month on top of your main job, that could double your savings rate. The key? Choose a hustle that fits your energy and schedule, not one that burns you out.

And don’t fall for hustle culture traps. Your side hustle shouldn’t feel like punishment-it should feel like freedom money.

**Book insight: Systems beat willpower every time**

“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” - *James Clear, “Atomic Habits,” Chapter 1*

The same goes for money. If your budget is based on vibes and hope, it won’t stick. Build a system. Automate it. Personalize it. Let it run in the background so your brain can focus on life-not math.

# Realistic Monthly Expenses for Gen Z Renters in 2025

Let’s cut the noise-budgeting isn't just about saving, it’s about *surviving* the month without checking your bank balance with one eye closed. Most Gen Z renters aren’t spending wildly. They’re just trying to cover the basics and still have enough left to feel like life isn’t one long loop of “eat, sleep, pay rent, repeat.”

The tricky part? Monthly expenses in 2025 aren’t what they used to be. Rent’s higher. WiFi costs more. And “cheap meals” somehow still cost $19. We’re not in the budgeting world of our parents anymore-and the numbers prove it.

**Average cost of living for Gen Z renters: rent, food, utilities, WiFi**

According to the latest **Census Pulse Survey** and **Bureau of Labor Statistics**, the average monthly expenses for a Gen Z renter in the U.S. now break down roughly like this:

* **Rent:** $1,317 nationally (higher in cities, lower in rural areas)  
* **Utilities:** $160–$220 depending on location  
* **Groceries:** $350–$500 if you're cooking regularly  
* **WiFi and phone:** $120 combined if you're not stuck in a legacy plan  
* **Transportation:** $100–$250 depending on car vs public transit  
* **Health insurance and meds:** $200+ if you’re not on a parent's plan  

So let’s say your after-tax income is $2,600/month. Just covering essentials-before touching restaurants, dates, subscriptions, or random life chaos-can easily eat up **$2,000–$2,200**.

That’s why even people doing *everything right* still feel broke. You’re not bad with money. You’re navigating a financial system that wasn’t built for entry-level wages and inflated living costs.

And still-we can work with it.

**What are Gen Z’s biggest financial drains? (subscriptions, Uber, eating out)**

Here’s the part nobody budgets for, but everyone spends on: **the lifestyle drip**.

It’s not the big costs that sneak up on you-it’s the little ones that add up when you’re not looking. Think:

* Two rideshares a week when it’s raining  
* DoorDash because you forgot to defrost the chicken  
* That Canva Pro subscription you forgot to cancel  
* A “quick” Target run that turned into a $70 checkout  

In 2025, **the average Gen Z renter spends $280–$420/month** on these “variable expenses,” according to recent Nielsen and Mintel consumer data. And the reason isn’t lack of willpower-it’s emotional fatigue.

When your work is draining and your rent’s draining and your future feels one global crisis away from collapse, saying “yes” to convenience feels like survival.

I’ve been there. I once spent over $300 in a single month on Uber and takeaway *just* because my apartment didn’t have a working stove and my job made me cry on the train home. It wasn’t laziness-it was burnout.

The fix isn’t eliminating these expenses entirely. It’s finding a number that feels *good* to spend without guilt-and creating space for it in your budget. If $150 of fun money helps you stay sane and avoid worse burnout spending later, that’s a smart investment.

**How to reduce spending without giving up lifestyle perks**

The goal isn’t to stop spending on things you love. It’s to stop spending on stuff you don’t even notice you bought.

You don’t have to cut coffee or cancel Spotify. But you *do* have to know what’s worth it for you and what’s just background spending.

Start by asking:

* What expense brings me joy every week?  
* What expense I wouldn’t even miss if it disappeared?  

Then do a “90-day audit” of your past three months of spending-yes, even if it’s painful. Open your banking app, sort by category, and look at where your money actually goes.

When I did this, I realized I was paying for three cloud storage services and never checked two of them. I canceled them and reallocated that $20/month into my weekend fund. No loss, all win.

One underrated hack: cap your Uber or food delivery budget to a number that makes you *think twice* before ordering, not feel guilty. For me, that’s $60/month. If I hit it mid-month, I switch to meal prep or ask friends to hang out somewhere walkable.

**Top apps to track spending and improve savings habits**

Let’s keep this human: you don’t need a spreadsheet with 14 tabs. You need one app that shows you where your money’s going *without shame.*

In 2025, Gen Z’s go-tos are:

* **Copilot** for smart, clean visuals that actually motivate you  
* **Rocket Money** to cancel sneaky subscriptions and track bills  
* **YNAB (You Need A Budget)** for people who want full control  
* **Emma** if you want fun vibes with real insights  

I use Copilot because it lets me see “money vibes” by day. Red means I overspent. Green means I’m under budget. That’s it. No math. Just vibes and reality.

The trick is finding an app that speaks your language. If you don’t like looking at it, you won’t use it. And if you don’t use it, you’ll just keep wondering where your paycheck went.

**Book insight: The power of spending with intention**

“Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people they don't like.” - *Will Rogers*, as quoted in *""Your Money or Your Life,""* by Vicki Robin, Chapter 2

Modern budgeting isn’t about being perfect-it’s about knowing *why* you spend. Once you understand your patterns, you can design a budget that supports your real priorities, not random defaults.

# Smart Saving Goals for Short and Long Term

To be honest, saving money when you’re renting in your 20s isn’t about hitting some big, clean number. It’s about **building a sense of safety**. The kind that lets you sleep without anxiety at 2am. The kind that helps you say “no” to sketchy side gigs or terrible roommates because you’ve got a little cushion. That’s the real win.

But not all savings are created equal. Some are about getting through the month. Others are about making moves-literally and financially. The key is knowing which goals matter now, and which can wait without guilt.

**How much should you save for emergencies as a renter?**

Forget six months. That number gets tossed around like it’s the gold standard, but for most Gen Z renters, it feels more like an impossible dream than an actual goal.

Let’s scale it down. Your real first milestone? **$500.** That’s it.

Because $500 covers:

* An urgent car fix  
* A security deposit top-up  
* A last-minute flight for a family emergency  
* A week or two of groceries and Uber rides if you lose your job  

Once you hit $500, aim for **one month’s total expenses**. Not just rent-*everything*. Look at your average month (rent, food, transit, meds, bills) and stash that number away.

From there, grow it to 2–3 months *if you can*. But don’t let the “perfect” stop you from starting.

I saved my first $500 during a summer I was living paycheck to paycheck, doing freelance editing and serving at a bar. It took me two months. I kept it in a separate account I literally named “Break Glass in Case of Life.” That fund saved me when my laptop died during finals. That $500 was worth more than any designer bag or tech upgrade I’ve ever bought.

**When and how to start saving for a security deposit or move-out fund**

If you’ve ever had a roommate eat your labeled leftovers *and* leave hair in the drain, you know why a “move-out fund” matters.

You don’t want to be stuck in a place-or with people-just because you can’t afford to leave. That’s where the **move-out fund** comes in.

The math is simple:

* One month of rent  
* A full deposit (usually one month’s rent)  
* Moving costs ($300–$600 if you hire help or rent a truck)  
* First-month expenses at the new place  

In most cities, that adds up to **$3,000–$4,000**. Don’t panic. You don’t have to save it all at once. Start small-$50/month, then scale up with bonuses, side gigs, or cash gifts.

Put it in a separate account and don’t touch it unless you’re *actually* moving. It’s your “I’m out” money-the kind that lets you walk away from a bad situation with your head up.

Even if you don’t plan on moving soon, having that stash gives you options. And in your 20s, options are power.

**How Gen Z can balance debt repayment with savings**

This is where most people freeze. You’ve got credit card debt. Maybe student loans. Rent keeps rising. And everyone’s yelling about investing and high-yield savings and Roth IRAs like you’re not just trying to make it to next Friday.

So here’s the honest answer: **you can do both-but not equally, and not always at the same time**.

If your credit card has a sky-high interest rate (think 20%+), throw extra cash at that first. You’re losing money every month you don’t. Even small extra payments make a difference.

But-and this is important-**don’t stop saving entirely** while you pay off debt. You still need that emergency fund. Otherwise, you’ll swipe your card again the next time your tire blows out.

Even just $20/month into savings while you’re focused on debt helps break the cycle. Once you’ve got $500–$1,000 stashed, you can pause and go harder on debt payoff.

There’s no perfect formula. Just progress that feels sustainable.

**Should you invest while renting or save more first?**

TikTok finance is obsessed with investing right now-and yes, it’s powerful. Compound interest is real. Starting early is smart.

But if you don’t have an emergency fund, if your rent is overdue, if your credit card balance makes you anxious just thinking about it-*investing can wait*.

Before you buy your first stock, cover your survival. Build your buffer. Pay your bills. Make sure your financial floor isn’t cracked.

Once that’s steady? Absolutely start investing. Even $50/month into a Roth IRA or index fund is a long-term win. Just don’t let internet FOMO push you into skipping steps.

Saving first is about stability. Investing later is about growth. You need both-but in the right order.

**Book insight: Build financial peace, not just wealth**

“Money is not just a math problem. It’s a behavior problem. Build habits that give you peace of mind-even before they give you returns.” - *Dave Ramsey, “The Total Money Makeover,” Chapter 4*

Security doesn’t come from hitting $10K in a high-yield account. It comes from knowing you’re not one bad week away from crisis. That’s what saving smart looks like.

# Financial Tools Gen Z Renters Are Using in 2025

You can have the best intentions. You can write down your goals, build a spreadsheet, even make a vision board with magazine cutouts. But if your money tools suck-or worse, *stress you out*\-sticking to your financial plan is going to feel like forcing yourself to eat plain oats every day for dinner.

That’s why having the *right* tools matters. Not just for tracking spending or saving more, but for making your money life feel like something you can *actually manage*. The best tools in 2025 don’t just show you your balance-they give you clarity, confidence, and low-key dopamine when you save without thinking about it.

Here’s what’s actually working for Gen Z renters right now-not in theory, but in real, everyday use.

**Top budgeting apps Gen Z loves: Mint, YNAB, Rocket Money, Copilot**

Let’s start with the apps that don’t just track your money-they make it *make sense*.

**Mint** used to be the king of budgeting. But as of early 2025, it’s being phased out by Intuit, and users are moving fast to alternatives.

The most popular switch-ups?

* **YNAB (You Need A Budget)**: Not flashy, but wildly effective. It’s for people who want full control-where every dollar gets a job and nothing goes unaccounted for. If budgeting makes your brain feel chaotic, YNAB brings structure and sanity.  
* **Copilot**: Clean, intuitive, and visual. Gen Z loves this app because it’s like a money dashboard that talks to you in charts and vibes, not spreadsheets. It shows you trends, monthly “vibe checks” on spending, and lets you label categories in your own words (which, yes, makes a difference).  
* **Rocket Money**: Built for managing subscriptions, catching sneaky charges, and negotiating bills automatically. Think of it as your assistant who quietly saves you money without asking for a raise.  

All of these apps do more than show numbers-they reduce anxiety. They help you move from *reacting* to your money to *actually owning it*.

**Best high-yield savings accounts with no fees for renters**

There are two things that matter when picking a savings account in 2025: **interest rate** and **zero friction**.

Because if it takes 3 days to transfer your money, or if you’re earning 0.01% APY while inflation eats your lunch, what’s the point?

Right now, the best high-yield savings accounts for Gen Z renters offer:

* **4.25%–5.10% APY**  
* No monthly fees  
* Easy mobile access  
* Instant transfer to linked checking  

The top names in the game?

* **Ally Bank**  
* **SoFi**  
* **Discover Online Savings**  
* **American Express High-Yield Savings**  

These aren’t shady startups. They’re FDIC-insured, mobile-first, and easy to use. Most let you set up multiple “buckets” or savings goals inside one account-so you can separate your emergency fund from your vacation stash without juggling five logins.

Personally, I use Ally. I’ve got four buckets: Emergency, Rent Buffer, Fun Money, and “Escape Fund” (because who doesn’t dream of buying a last-minute ticket and disappearing for a while?). Seeing them all grow-slowly but surely-genuinely gives me peace.

**AI-powered savings tools and auto-transfers: worth it?**

AI’s been showing up in every part of life in 2025-from TikTok algorithms to customer support chats that weirdly know your name. But here’s where it actually helps: **automated savings.**

Apps like **Qapital**, **Digit**, and **Monarch Money** use AI to learn your spending patterns and automatically move small amounts of money into savings *without you noticing*.

So if you usually spend less on weekends, it might stash $12 from Saturday night. If your paycheck lands and you’ve got some breathing room? It’ll save $40 before you can spend it on a “quick treat.”

The result: passive saving that doesn’t require constant decisions.

These tools are especially helpful if:

* You struggle with consistency  
* You tend to spend first and regret later  
* You want a “set it and forget it” system that works in the background  

Is it perfect? No. Sometimes the auto-transfers can mess with your timing if you’re cutting it close to rent. But overall, if you’re trying to build the *habit* of saving before you build wealth, AI-powered tools are a solid first step.

**Neobanks vs traditional banks for Gen Z savers: what’s better?**

You’ve probably seen the TikToks: “Ditch your boomer bank.” And honestly, they’ve got a point.

Traditional banks like Chase or Bank of America come with brick-and-mortar vibes-and fees. Lots of them. Overdraft fees, maintenance fees, minimum balance requirements... all things that punish you for not being rich already.

Neobanks, on the other hand, are built for digital-native users. Think: **Chime, Varo, Current, Revolut**.

These banks usually offer:

* Early paycheck access (up to 2 days early)  
* Instant transfers between checking and savings  
* Fee-free overdraft protection  
* Modern UX that doesn’t feel like Windows 95  

That said, the right answer isn’t always either-or.

Many Gen Z renters are keeping a traditional bank account (for things like direct deposit, credit history, or parental transfers) and using a neobank or app for daily spending and saving.

The key is to pick a system that matches your money style. If you want visibility, speed, and zero fees, neobanks win. If you care more about reliability and long-term options like mortgages or loans, you might stick with a hybrid.

You don’t need to be loyal to any one bank. Be loyal to what gives you control.

“Tools amplify behavior. A hammer can build or destroy. Money apps can do the same. Choose ones that build your best habits.” - *Cal Newport, “Digital Minimalism,” Chapter 6*

1lnbl4i,https://youtu.be/5XyXH2uStAU,3 Very Scary TRUE Solo Travel Horror Stories,"# ""The Shortcut: My First Solo Trip Almost Turned Into a Nightmare"":

My first solo trip was to Costa Rica, a place I’d dreamed of visiting for its lush jungles and vibrant culture. San Jose, the capital, was my first stop, a city buzzing with life—street vendors calling out, music spilling from open windows, and the hum of traffic weaving through crowded roads. I’d spent the day exploring, my sneakers scuffing against the uneven pavement of the central market, where stalls overflowed with bright fruits and handmade crafts. I’d snapped photos of colorful murals, sipped sweet coffee at a tiny café, and marveled at ancient stone carvings in a museum. By evening, my legs ached, and my heart was full of the thrill of being on my own in a new country. I was ready to head back to my hostel, a budget place called Pangea, to rest for another day of adventure.

Standing on a busy street corner, I raised my hand to flag down a cab. The air was thick with the smell of grilled corn and exhaust. A yellow taxi pulled up, its paint chipped and faded. The driver, a man in his forties with a weathered face, thin mustache, and slicked-back hair, leaned out the window. “Where to, señorita?” he asked, his voice smooth, almost too friendly.

“Hostel Pangea, please,” I said, sliding into the back seat. My small laptop bag sat on my lap, heavy with my essentials—passport, laptop, camera, a notebook, and a thin stack of local currency. I’d read enough travel blogs to know to keep it close, and my fingers gripped the strap tightly.

“No problem,” he said, flashing a smile in the rearview mirror that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “First time in Costa Rica?”

“Yeah,” I replied, settling into the worn leather seat. The cab smelled faintly of cigarette smoke and cheap air freshener. “It’s been incredible. The market was so lively today, and the people are so warm.”

“Traveling alone?” he asked, his eyes flicking to me in the mirror. “That’s brave. A young woman like you, all by yourself?”

I nodded, a little uneasy at his tone but brushing it off as curiosity. “I wanted to challenge myself. It’s been fun meeting people along the way.”

“Be careful,” he said, his voice dropping slightly. “Not everyone here is what they seem.”

I forced a laugh, trying to lighten the mood. “I’m learning that. But everyone’s been kind so far.”

He didn’t respond, just nodded, his hands tightening on the steering wheel. The city lights flashed by, neon signs and streetlamps casting fleeting glows across the dashboard. But then I noticed we’d turned off the main road. The streets were narrower now, lined with shuttered shops and crumbling buildings. The crowds had vanished, replaced by empty sidewalks and flickering streetlights. My stomach twisted.

“Is this the way to the hostel?” I asked, my voice thinner than I intended.

“Shortcut,” he said curtly, not looking at me. A soft click echoed in the cab—the doors locking. My heart lurched.

I glanced at the door handle, wondering if I could unlock it quickly if I needed to. “It just… doesn’t look familiar,” I said, trying to sound casual. “I came through the main roads earlier.”

“Relax, señorita,” he snapped, his voice sharp now. “I know these streets better than you.”

My pulse quickened, thudding in my ears. I hugged my bag tighter, the straps cutting into my palms. The buildings outside grew darker, their windows boarded up or broken, like gaping mouths. The cab’s engine hummed too loudly in the silence, and the driver’s eyes kept darting to me in the mirror, cold and calculating. I told myself I was overreacting, that he was just a grumpy driver taking a faster route. But my body didn’t believe it. My hands shook as I checked my phone—no signal. Of course.

“Why are you so nervous?” he asked suddenlylaught, his tone mocking. “You’re making me nervous, too.”

“I’m not,” I said quickly, but my voice betrayed me. “I just want to get to the hostel.”

He chuckled, a low, unsettling sound. “You tourists. Always so jumpy.”

The cab slowed as we pulled up to a building that looked like my hostel, its neon sign flickering in the distance. Relief flooded me, but it was short-lived. I reached for my wallet, my fingers clumsy. “How much?”

“Ten thousand colones,” he said, turning to face me fully. His eyes were hard, like stones.

I handed him the bills, my hands trembling. But as I reached for the door, he lunged forward and grabbed my laptop bag, yanking it from my lap. The force knocked the breath out of me. “This isn’t enough,” he growled. “You need to pay more.”

My heart stopped. “What?” I gasped, pointing at the meter on the dashboard, its numbers glowing clearly. “That’s what it says!”

He ignored me, clutching my bag tightly. “More money, or I keep this,” he said, his voice low and menacing. He leaned closer, his breath hot and sour. “Everything’s in here, isn’t it? Passport, camera… you’d be lost without it.”

Panic clawed at my chest. My passport, my laptop, my camera—my entire trip depended on that bag. Without it, I’d be stranded, helpless. “Please,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “I don’t have more. That’s all I have.”

“Empty your pockets,” he demanded, his grip on my bag tightening. His eyes bore into mine, dark and unyielding, and I felt like a trapped animal. The locked doors seemed to close in around me, the cab a cage.

My hands shook as I fumbled in my pockets, pulling out every last bill—about fifty dollars in colones. “This is it,” I said, holding it out. “Please, just give me my bag.”

For a long moment, he stared at me, his face unreadable. Then he snatched the money, his rough fingers brushing mine, making me flinch. I thought he’d keep the bag anyway, but he suddenly shoved it out the window, letting it thud onto the sidewalk. “Get out,” he snarled.

I scrambled for the door handle, my fingers slipping in my panic. The lock clicked open, and I stumbled out, grabbing my bag from the ground. My knees buckled as I stood, and the cab’s tires screeched as he sped off, the red taillights swallowed by the darkness.

I stood frozen, clutching my bag, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst. I checked it frantically—passport, laptop, camera, notebook, all still there. I’d lost the money, but nothing else. Yet the fear clung to me, cold and heavy. The street was too quiet, the shadows too deep. I felt eyes on me, watching from the darkness.

Then I heard it—footsteps. Slow, deliberate, coming from the alley across the street. My blood ran cold. A figure emerged, tall and lanky, his face hidden in the shadow of a hooded jacket. He didn’t move, just stood there, staring. My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to move, backing toward the hostel’s entrance, my eyes locked on him. He took a step forward, and I ran.

I burst through the hostel’s glass door, the bell above it jangling loudly. The receptionist, a woman with dark hair and a gentle smile, looked up from her desk. “Are you okay?” she asked, her brow furrowing as she saw my face.

“I… I was almost robbed,” I stammered, my voice barely audible. “The cab driver… he grabbed my bag, took my money, threatened me.”

Her eyes widened, and she stood, coming around the desk. “Oh, no, that’s awful. Are you hurt?”

I shook my head, tears stinging my eyes. “No, just… scared. He locked the doors, and then… there was someone else outside, watching me.”

She frowned, glancing at the door. “Watching you? Did they follow you?”

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice trembling. “I ran inside.”

“Stay here,” she said, grabbing a phone. “I’m calling security to check outside. You’re safe now.”

I sank into a chair in the lobby, clutching my bag like a lifeline. The receptionist spoke quickly into the phone, her voice firm. A security guard appeared, a burly man with a flashlight, and headed outside. I watched through the glass, my heart still racing, but the street looked empty now. The guard returned, shaking his head. “No one out there,” he said.

The receptionist sat beside me, her hand gentle on my arm. “It happens sometimes,” she said softly. “Some drivers prey on tourists. Always use official cabs or call our trusted service next time, okay?”

I nodded, feeling foolish and small. “I didn’t know. It was my first day here.”

“You couldn’t have known,” she said kindly. “You did the right thing getting out. Try to rest now. Tomorrow will be better.”

I thanked her and dragged myself to my room, a small space with a creaky bunk bed and a single window. I locked the door, checked it twice, and collapsed onto the bed, my bag still in my arms. Sleep wouldn’t come. Every creak of the building made me jump, and I kept seeing the driver’s cold eyes, hearing those footsteps in the alley. I checked my bag again, counting every item, terrified I’d missed something. Everything was there, but the fear wouldn’t leave.

The next morning, I sat in the hostel’s courtyard, sipping coffee, trying to shake the night before. The city looked different now—less vibrant, more menacing. I called my mom, my voice shaking as I told her what happened. “Come home,” she urged, but I refused. I’d come to Costa Rica to prove I could do this, and I wouldn’t let one terrifying night stop me.

For the rest of the trip, I was changed. I memorized the look of official cabs, avoided traveling alone after dark, and kept my bag slung across my body at all times. Every stranger’s glance made my heart race, and I scanned every street for hidden figures. But I didn’t stop exploring. I hiked through misty rainforests, swam in turquoise waters, and laughed with kind locals who shared their stories over homemade meals. The beauty of the country slowly healed the fear, though it never fully left.





# ""Room 312: The Night They Tried to Get In"":

After a messy breakup in Georgia, I decided it was now or never. I packed my beat-up hatchback with clothes, a cooler full of snacks, a dog-eared road atlas, and a playlist of old rock and indie tunes. The plan was simple: drive from Georgia to California, stopping at small towns and quirky roadside attractions along the way. It felt like a fresh start, a chance to rediscover myself. By the time I hit San Diego, though, I was exhausted. Days of driving through endless highways, fueled by gas station coffee and granola bars, had left me drained. My eyes stung, my back ached, and all I wanted was a shower and a bed.

I’d booked a hotel room through Expedia for one night in San Diego, near Mission Valley off I-15 on Murphy Canyon Road. The hotel wasn’t fancy, but the price was right—$89 for a single room—and the reviews described it as “decent” and “clean enough.” Good enough for a quick stopover before heading north to Los Angeles. When I pulled into the parking lot around 9 pm, the hotel looked shabbier than the glossy photos online. The sign’s neon letters flickered, spelling out “VAC NCY” instead of “VACANCY.” The building’s stucco walls were cracked, and a few windows had duct tape holding up plastic sheets. I told myself it was just one night.

The lobby didn’t inspire confidence. The air smelled of stale cigarettes and cheap air freshener. A flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows on the worn linoleum floor. Behind the front desk sat a man in his fifties, his gray hair thinning, his eyes fixed on a computer screen. He wore a faded polo shirt with the hotel logo—a palm tree that looked like it was wilting.

“Checking in?” he asked, barely looking up.

“Yes, I have a reservation,” I said, giving my name and sliding my ID across the counter.

He tapped at the keyboard, his fingers moving sluggishly. After a moment, he handed me a key card in a paper sleeve. “Room 312, third floor. Elevator’s down the hall.” He gestured vaguely to the left, his eyes already back on the screen.

“Thanks,” I said, grabbing the key card and heading toward the elevator. It was one of those old ones, with scratched metal doors and buttons that barely lit up. It creaked and groaned as it climbed to the third floor, making me wonder when it was last inspected. The hallway was long and narrow, the carpet a faded red with dark patches that looked like old spills. The wallpaper, a beige floral pattern, peeled at the corners, revealing yellowed plaster underneath. My room was at the far end, and I had to swipe the key card twice before the lock buzzed and clicked open.

Inside, the room was as tired as the rest of the hotel. The bed had a thin mattress with a lumpy comforter, and the pillows felt like they were stuffed with cotton balls. A single lamp on the nightstand cast a weak yellow glow, leaving the corners of the room in shadow. The carpet had more of those unsettling stains, and the curtains—heavy, dusty things—hung unevenly over a window that overlooked the parking lot. I peeked into the bathroom: a chipped sink, a shower with rust stains, and a single towel that looked like it had been washed a thousand times. I sighed. It wasn’t the Hilton, but it would do.

I locked the door, noticing the handle felt loose, like it might come off with a good tug. For extra peace of mind, I slid the lock bar into place—a sturdy metal arm that hooked into the doorframe. Traveling alone as a woman, I’d learned to take every precaution. You hear too many stories. I dropped my backpack on the floor, took a quick shower under a weak stream of lukewarm water, and changed into my pajamas—a soft T-shirt and sweatpants. My phone was at 20%, so I plugged it into the outlet by the bed, set an alarm for 7 am, and crawled under the covers. The mattress springs squeaked, but I was so tired I didn’t care. Sleep came fast.

A loud thud jolted me awake. My eyes flew open, my heart hammering in my chest. For a second, I thought I’d imagined it, my mind still foggy from sleep. Then it came again—a sharp, deliberate bang against the door, followed by a rattling sound, like someone was trying to force the handle. I glanced at the digital clock on the nightstand: 4:03 am. The room was dark, save for the faint orange glow of streetlights sneaking through the curtains. My mouth went dry as I lay there, frozen, straining to listen.

Then I heard voices. Male voices, low and muffled, just outside the door. “Come on, open up, sweetheart,” one said, his tone smooth but laced with something sinister. “We know you’re in there.”

My stomach twisted into a knot. My breath caught in my throat as another voice, rougher and deeper, chimed in. “Pretty girl like you shouldn’t be alone. Let’s have some fun.”

The door handle jiggled again, more violently this time. The door itself pushed inward, straining against the lock bar with a creak that made my skin crawl. Thank God for that lock bar—it held firm, the only thing keeping them out. I could hear them muttering to each other, their words too low to make out, but the tone was enough to make my blood run cold. My mind raced with questions: Who were these men? How did they know I was here? Did they follow me from the lobby? The parking lot?

I grabbed my phone, my hands shaking so badly I fumbled and nearly dropped it. I crouched on the bed, pulling the blanket around me like a shield, and dialed the front desk. The phone rang once, twice, three times—each ring felt like an eternity. Finally, the same bored clerk from earlier answered.

“Front desk, how can I help you?” he said, his voice flat, like I was interrupting his nap.

“There are two men trying to get into my room!” I whispered, my voice trembling. “They’re outside my door, shaking the handle. Please, send security or call the police!”

A long pause. I could hear him breathing, slow and heavy, on the other end. “What room are you in, ma’am?”

“Room 312,” I said, my eyes locked on the door. The handle had stopped moving, but I could still hear their voices, low and indistinct.

Another pause, longer this time. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but our system shows no reservation for room 312. Are you sure you’re at the right hotel?”

My heart sank. “What are you talking about? I checked in with you tonight! I gave you my ID! I have the booking confirmation on my phone—it’s through Expedia!”

“Ma’am,” he said, his voice infuriatingly calm, “our records show room 312 was re-rented to another guest earlier this evening. We don’t have any reservation under your name.”

“That’s impossible!” I hissed, trying to keep my voice low so the men outside wouldn’t hear. “I’m in room 312 right now! I checked in a few hours ago. You gave me the key card yourself!”

“I’m sorry, ma’am,” he said, not sounding sorry at all. “We don’t partner with Expedia. Maybe you booked at the hotel across the street. It happens sometimes.”

I wanted to scream. “I’m not across the street! I’m in your hotel, in your room! There are men trying to break in—do something!”

Just then, I heard a muffled curse outside, followed by the sound of footsteps retreating down the hallway. The men were leaving, their voices fading into the distance. My shoulders sagged with relief, but my heart was still pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat.

“They’re gone,” I told the clerk, my voice shaky. “But what’s going on with my reservation? You’re telling me I’m not supposed to be here?”

“Ma’am, I suggest you come to the front desk in the morning,” he said, his tone still maddeningly detached. “The manager will be in at 9 am. We can sort it out then.”

“Sort it out then?” I repeated, my fear giving way to anger. “Someone just tried to break into my room, and you’re saying I’m not even registered here? I don’t feel safe staying here!”

“I’m sorry, ma’am,” he said again, like a broken record. “There’s nothing I can do right now. Try to get some rest.”

Rest? After that? I hung up, my hands still trembling. I checked the door again, pressing my ear against it to listen for any sound. Silence, except for the faint hum of the air conditioner. I double-checked the lock bar, then dragged the desk chair across the room and wedged it under the door handle, tilting it so the backrest braced against the door. It wasn’t much, but it was something. I grabbed the lamp from the nightstand, a heavy brass thing, and placed it on the bed next to me. If anyone got in, I’d swing it like a bat.

I sat cross-legged on the bed, clutching my phone, too scared to lie down. Every creak of the building, every distant thud, made me jump. I opened the Expedia app to check my booking confirmation. There it was: my name, the hotel’s address, room 312, paid in full. I even had the email receipt with the booking number. How could the clerk say I wasn’t in their system? Was it a glitch? A scam? Or something worse? My mind spiraled, imagining the clerk was in on it, maybe even the men outside. I thought about calling the police, but what would I tell them? The men were gone, and I had no proof except my word and a booking confirmation the hotel claimed didn’t exist.

I tried calling Expedia’s customer service, but a recorded message said their lines were open from 8 am to 8 pm. Useless. I sat there, staring at the door, my phone at 15% now despite being plugged in—the outlet must’ve been faulty. The room felt smaller, the shadows darker. I kept replaying the men’s voices in my head: “Pretty girl like you shouldn’t be alone.” My skin crawled. Had they seen me in the lobby? Followed me from the parking lot? Or was it random, some sick game they played with whoever was in room 312?

The rest of the night was torture. I didn’t sleep, didn’t even close my eyes. I kept the lamp on, its dim light barely pushing back the darkness. Around 5 am, I heard footsteps in the hallway again, slow and heavy. I held my breath, gripping the lamp, but no one touched the door. The footsteps faded, and I let out a shaky sigh. By 6:30 am, the first hints of daylight crept through the curtains, and I felt safe enough to pack my things. I threw my clothes into my backpack, checked the hallway through the peephole—empty—and made my way to the elevator.

In the lobby, a different clerk was at the desk, a young woman with neatly braided hair and a polite smile. The night clerk was gone, thank goodness. I approached the desk, my hands still shaky from adrenaline and lack of sleep.

“Good morning,” she said brightly. “Checking out?”

“Yes, but I need to talk about what happened last night,” I said, pulling out my phone to show her the Expedia confirmation. I told her everything—the men trying to get in, the night clerk’s bizarre claim that I wasn’t in their system, the fear that kept me up all night.

Her smile faded as she listened. She typed something into the computer, her brow furrowing. “I’m really sorry, ma’am, but I don’t see any reservation under your name for room 312. Our system shows that room was assigned to another guest last night.”

I stared at her, my frustration boiling over. “That’s what the other guy said, but I was in that room! I checked in last night! You can see my booking right here.” I shoved my phone toward her, the confirmation email open.

She glanced at it, then back at the computer. “This is strange. Let me get the manager.”

A few minutes later, a man in a wrinkled suit appeared, his name tag reading “Manager.” He was in his forties, with thinning hair and a forced smile. I repeated my story, my voice shaking with a mix of anger and exhaustion. I showed him the confirmation email, the key card, everything.

He nodded, his expression unreadable. “I’m very sorry for the confusion, ma’am. It sounds like there was a glitch in our booking system, or maybe an issue with Expedia. These third-party sites can be unreliable. We’ll process a full refund immediately, and I’ll speak to the night staff about what happened.”

A refund was better than nothing, but it didn’t explain the men at my door or the clerk’s refusal to help. “What about the men trying to get into my room?” I pressed. “That wasn’t a glitch. I could’ve been hurt.”

“We take security very seriously,” he said, his tone practiced. “I’ll review our camera footage and look into it. Can you describe the men?”

I shook my head. “I didn’t see them, just heard their voices. They were trying to open the door, saying things like… like they knew I was in there.”

His face didn’t change. “We’ll investigate, I promise. In the meantime, you’re welcome to stay another night, on us.”

“No, thank you,” I said quickly. The thought of spending another minute in that hotel made my stomach churn. “I’m leaving now.”

As I walked to my car, the morning air felt heavy, oppressive. My legs wobbled, and I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see someone following me. I threw my backpack into the passenger seat and locked the doors as soon as I got in. My hands were still shaking as I started the engine.

I drove away, my heart still racing. Later that day, I wrote reviews on Google and Yelp, warning other travelers about the hotel’s shoddy security and bizarre booking issues. I called Expedia again, and they promised to investigate, but weeks later, I got a generic email saying they’d “resolved the issue” with no details. The experience left a mark on me, a lingering fear that made me question every hotel I stayed in after that. I kept traveling, but I was more cautious—checking locks twice, reading reviews obsessively, and always, always using the lock bar.





# ""Trust and Tuktuks"":

Sri Lanka had been on my list for years, its ancient ruins, vibrant culture, and green landscapes pulling me in. After months of saving and planning, I landed in Colombo, my backpack stuffed with essentials and a guidebook I’d read cover to cover. I spent a few days wandering the city’s crowded markets and temples, but I craved something quieter, more authentic. That’s when I decided to head to Ella, a small village nestled in the hills, famous for its tea plantations and hiking trails.

The train ride to Ella was breathtaking. I sat by the window, watching rice paddies and misty hills roll by, the carriage filled with the chatter of locals and the occasional tourist snapping photos. When I arrived, I checked into a small guesthouse run by a warm family. The mother, with a gentle smile, handed me a key to a room with a view of the hills. “Be careful if you go out alone,” she said, her tone light but with a hint of caution I didn’t fully register at the time.

The next morning, I woke up buzzing with excitement. I wanted to explore the village center, maybe find a local café or a guide for a hike. Dressed in a light shirt, cargo pants, and sturdy sneakers, I slung my small backpack over my shoulder, packed with my phone, a water bottle, and a folding umbrella I’d brought for unexpected rain. I stepped onto the dusty street outside the guesthouse, where the air was alive with the sounds of vendors calling out, scooters buzzing, and the rhythmic clatter of tuktuks.

I waved down the first tuktuk I saw. The driver, a young man with a thin mustache and a bright red shirt, leaned out and flashed a wide grin. “Hello! Where you want to go?” he asked, his English clipped but clear.

“Village center, please,” I said, climbing into the back. The seat was worn, and the tuktuk smelled faintly of petrol and incense.

“Okay, fifty rupees,” he said, starting the engine with a sputter.

I nodded, settling in as we pulled away. He glanced at me in the rearview mirror. “You alone? First time in Sri Lanka?”

“Yes, first time. I love traveling alone,” I said, smiling. “Ella looks beautiful.”

“It is! I show you good places,” he said, his eyes flicking back to the road. We chatted as we drove, him asking about my home country and me sharing bits about my travels. He seemed friendly, and I relaxed, watching the scenery shift from village houses with colorful laundry hanging outside to open fields dotted with grazing cows.

But about fifteen minutes into the ride, I noticed we’d turned off the main road onto a narrow dirt path. The houses disappeared, replaced by thick trees and tangled vines. The path was rough, and the tuktuk jolted with every bump. A prickle of unease crept up my spine. “Is this the way to the village center?” I asked, keeping my voice steady.

“Yes, yes, shortcut. Save time,” he said, not turning around. His tone was too casual, like he was trying to convince himself as much as me.

The path grew narrower, the trees closing in. My stomach tightened. “I don’t think this is right. Can we go back to the main road?” I said, louder this time.

He didn’t respond. The tuktuk sped up, the engine whining. My heart started pounding. I leaned forward, gripping the edge of the seat. “Please, stop. I want to go back.”

He turned his head slightly, his smile gone, his eyes cold. “Relax, miss. I take you to nice place. You like it,” he said, his voice low and sharp.

Panic clawed at my chest. This wasn’t a mistake. He was taking me somewhere deliberately. I glanced around, seeing nothing but dense jungle. My fingers fumbled for the door handle, but it was stuck, rusted shut. “Stop the tuktuk now!” I shouted, banging on the side.

He slammed on the brakes, and I lurched forward. Before I could react, he reached back and grabbed my wrist, his grip bruising. “You stay!” he snarled, his face twisted with anger.

“Let me go!” I screamed, yanking against him. My free hand found my umbrella, heavy and solid. I swung it hard, striking his forearm. He yelped, his grip loosening just enough for me to pull free. I shoved the door open with my shoulder and tumbled out, hitting the dirt hard. Scrambling to my feet, I ran into the jungle, branches snapping against my face.

I didn’t look back. My lungs burned as I crashed through the undergrowth, thorns snagging my clothes. My sneakers sank into the soft earth, slowing me down, but I kept running, driven by pure adrenaline. The jungle was a maze of green, the air thick with the buzz of insects and the distant cry of a bird. Finally, I ducked behind a massive banyan tree, my chest heaving. I pressed myself against the rough bark, listening. Was he chasing me? I heard nothing but my own ragged breathing.

I stayed there for what felt like hours, my heart hammering. My wrist throbbed where he’d grabbed me, and my arms were scratched and bleeding from the branches. My phone had no signal, and my water bottle was nearly empty. I tried to think. The sun had been on my left during the drive. If I kept it on my right, I might find my way back to civilization. It was a desperate plan, but it was something.

I started walking, my legs shaky, my eyes darting at every sound—a rustling leaf, a snapping twig. The jungle seemed alive, watching me. Once, I heard footsteps behind me, heavy and deliberate. I froze, my breath catching, but when I turned, there was nothing but shadows. My mind was spiraling, imagining him lurking just out of sight. I clutched my umbrella tighter, its weight my only comfort.

Hours dragged on. My throat was parched, my water long gone. I stumbled across a shallow stream, its water murky but tempting. I knelt, splashing my face, the coolness grounding me for a moment. I wanted to drink but knew the risk of getting sick. As I stood, I heard voices—faint, but human. Hope surged, but so did fear. What if they were his friends?

I crept toward the sound and saw two farmers in a clearing, tending to crops. One, an older man with weathered skin, noticed me. I stepped forward, my voice hoarse. “Can you help me get to Ella village?”

He frowned, pointing down a path and saying something in Sinhala. I didn’t understand, but I nodded gratefully and followed his direction. The path led to a wider dirt road, and after what felt like an eternity, I saw rooftops in the distance. Relief hit me like a wave, but I wasn’t safe yet.

As I entered Ella, I passed a small shop with a faded sign. An elderly woman stood outside, arranging fruit. I approached her, desperate for help. “Excuse me, do you know a safe way to the village center?” I asked.

She looked me up and down, her eyes narrowing. “You look scared. What happened?” she asked, her English slow but clear.

I hesitated, not wanting to sound paranoid. “I… got lost. A tuktuk driver took me the wrong way.”

Her face darkened. “Some drivers, they not good. You be careful. Go straight, then left at the temple.” She pointed down the street.

I thanked her and hurried on, her words echoing in my head. At the village center, I found a busy café and slipped inside, my hands trembling as I ordered a tea. Sitting by the window, I overheard two men at a nearby table. “That tuktuk gang’s at it again,” one said. “Taking tourists out to the jungle, scaring them for money.” My blood ran cold. A gang? Was that what I’d escaped?

I couldn’t stay in Ella. The guesthouse had been my haven, but now it felt exposed. I returned, avoiding the tuktuk stand where a group of men watched me pass, one calling out, “Need a ride, miss?” His voice was too familiar, too sharp. I kept my head down, my heart racing.

At the guesthouse, the mother looked concerned when I said I was leaving. “So soon? Is something wrong?” she asked, her brow furrowed.

“Just a change of plans,” I said, forcing a smile. “Can you call a taxi? A real one, from a company?”

She nodded, picking up the phone. As I packed, I kept glancing out the window, half-expecting to see the driver or his friends waiting outside. When the taxi arrived, I practically ran to it, throwing my backpack in the back. “Train station, please,” I told the driver, a middle-aged man who barely spoke.

At the station, I bought a ticket to Kandy, a bigger city where I hoped I’d feel safer. As the train pulled away, I watched Ella’s green hills fade, my body finally relaxing. My wrist was bruised, my arms scratched, but I was alive. I’d escaped by trusting my instincts, but the fear lingered. I kept replaying the driver’s cold stare, the shopkeeper’s warning, the men at the tuktuk stand. Solo travel had always been my freedom, but now I knew its risks. Still, as the train rattled on, I felt a spark of defiance. I wouldn’t let this stop me. The world was too big, too beautiful, to give up.",1,1751193363.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I had spent the entire freezing night at the U.S. aid distribution center, hoping to bring something back for my wounded father and starving children.
At 10 PM, I left with hope. By sunrise, that hope was crushed.

An Israeli drone hovered over us. It opened fire—bullets, gas, stun grenades. Young men fell beside me. Some were killed, others dragged away bleeding.
And when the drone ran out of ammo, it broadcasted this message:
""You hungry dogs. There is no aid today. Go back to your tents.""

That’s how they see us. Not as humans. As animals.

At 8 AM, my mother woke me with swollen eyes and shaking hands. She handed me her wedding ring kept for 45 years and told me to sell it for flour.
Three kilos. That’s all we asked for.

Do you know what it means for a mother to give up her last piece of memory for a few kilos of flour?

I sold it for $97.
It wasn't enough for all the medicine we need. I bought two types. And some flour.

Meanwhile, my baby nephew Mohammad, not even one year old, is crying from hunger. We can’t find formula. The shelves are empty. One can costs more than we could ever afford. He doesn’t know money. He only knows pain.

You think the loudest sound in Gaza is bombs?
No. It’s the faint whimper of a baby too weak to cry.

And while this happens, the world scrolls, sips coffee, and moves on
as if we’re not real.

I’m not asking for luxury. Not even comfort.
Just help us survive.
We’re being starved, bombed, and humiliated while the world watches.

31 years old, mahilig sa anime, kape, at paglalakwatsa—looking for friends.
Laging handang makipagkwentuhan tungkol sa paborito mong series, weird na kape combos, o kung saan magandang bumiyahe na hindi masakit sa bulsa. 

Hindi ako life coach, pero marunong akong makinig. 'Pag may problema ka, pwede nating pag-usapan over coffee—instant man ‘yan o starbucks. Basta walang spoilers sa anime, ha?

Tara, usap tayo. Ka-chat lang, walang echos. ✌️

1lnbj4i,https://i.redd.it/5sklo2tbgu9f1.jpeg,Where can I buy Ricoffy in Kochi/Kerala?,"Hi! 
Bit of a long shot, but I used to get this instant coffee called Ricoffy (by Nestle) from my uncle in South Africa — it’s got this super smooth, creamy, mild taste and a bit of chicory in it. Lately, I’ve really been craving that familiar Ricoffy flavour — but I can’t find it anywhere in Kochi or online in India. Amazon and Flipkart show it as out of stock. Even some local gourmet stores didn’t have a clue. Has anyone in Kochi (or Kerala) come across Ricoffy recently? Or is there any imported food store in Kochi where I could check? Even a close-tasting alternative you’d recommend?

1lnbhqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1lnbhqk/back_from_3rd_vv_tips/,Back from 3rd VV - tips,"Got back from my 3rd VV on Scarlet (7 nights) a few weeks ago and wanted to summarise my tips and takeaways as two non party people who love VV for the food, vibe, and fitness/healthy options.

- The Dock: When you arrive, head straight to the Dock on 7. Order some of their “from the grill” items, a drink, and chill here. Iykyk.
- Grounds Club Too (The Galley): The new decor here is gorgeous. It’s an underrated place to have your breakfast or a quiet drink in the evening 
- Snacks for your fridge: If you like a late night snack, grab a couple things from the grab & go fridges, the Grounds Club Too bakery on 7, or sweets from the social club, and keep them in your fridge. The late night eats situation isn’t the best on VV
- Restaurant bookings: Don’t worry about booking dinners for every single night. This time, we grabbed food in the Galley, or a pizza and salad and just chilled outside in the evening sun. This is underrated.. You can get dressed up for drinks afterwards. Restaurants will also nearly always be able to seat walk-ins, but you can also pop along to Sailor Services on 5 when you arrive to organise a couple reservations 
- Protein shakes: 3rd cruise and just found out now that the pool bars do protein shakes. They’re really good! For general protein intake, we did a lot of steak skewers from The Dock, burgers in lettuce buns, roast meat of the day on a salad (not a priority for everyone but worth mentioning)
- Book fitness classes: The bookings open when you’re on board and on the ship wifi. They book up so if you want to secure a few classes, book them early. They’re pretty good!
- Dembarkation: Don’t wait until the last minute to disembark. Grab a coffee in the Gounds Club on 7, chill near the exit, and when the queue starts to build a little, join the queue.
- Diet drinks: If you like a zero cal drink/soda the only option on board is diet coke.. it’s a travesty. This time at every port we grabbed a few cans of diet drinks to have in our room
- You don’t have to get off at every port: This VV in particular, marina di cararra and civitaveccia were ages away from anywhere. We had a short wander around these port towns and got back on to chill

Maybe due to capacity issues, we felt the service wasn’t AS amazing this time, but it was 100% our most relaxing VV yet.

The reality is that, if this is the system we find ourselves in, it's because everyone allows it.

I have accepted a long time ago that things don't and won't change. All you can do is just figh your own fight and walk on dead bodies to get to the top (or at least in a good position where you can't be bothered anymore) and that's where I'm going. 

The alternative? Stay alongside the average guy, talk bs and wait for better times. What for? 

Everyone talks about ""oh if I only could get my hands on that ass*ole of my manager"" and ""we need to start a revolution"" and ""things oughta change around here"" all the crap you tell yourselves to feel better. You are not gonna do anything. Period. 

You suck, and you know it. Pardon the harshness but it's true. 

You are gonna go in tomorrow and follow orders and you ain't ginna say and do sh*t about it.  

I have been working my ass off since I was 14, delivering milk and newspapers. No one did anything to change the situation. 

20 years have passed and the only fight worth having was the one to climb my own social ladder. 

Now that I am a manager at my firm I have to f**king force people to fight for their own rights, higher pay, better work conditions, etc. 

Where is the toughness I hear about at the coffee machine during break time? 

I go into meetings and people quietly agree to everything they are told to do. 

I honestly think I know only 2 or 3 people in the company willing to take the fight to the CEO if they need to just so they can have better conditions and guess what? They are the only ones getting what they ask for.

What I am saying is that some of you should stop going around saying stupid sh*it and do something about it, quietly. Nobody cares about your fantasy world crusade. Like really. People will listen to you and won't care at all while nodding.
