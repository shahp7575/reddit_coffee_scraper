To start of, I (25y) have a Narcistic mother. My mom had me when she was 17. When I was born, my grandmother fought in court for custody over me because she felt my mom and dad were too young to be able to properly take care of me. My mom fought against it and apparently told the court she would do anything to keep me. In this time I was living with my grandmother. Back then grandparents didn't really have much rights unless they could prove that your child is unfit of caring for a child. The court told my parents they can have me if my mom can get a job and hold it and it would be better if they married because a unity is better for the child. My mom did exactly what the court did and not long my parents could pick me up. By then my mom was already complaining that she missed all my firsts.

My parents married, well that was a struggle on its own. My mom is, well, difficult and my dad is, as everyone till this day says, is the calmest man they ever met. Everyone says they constantly fought and they did not have much money so they rented the garage of an old lady for us all to live in. The thing is, my mom did not really care much. All she wanted to do was party. Even now she tells people she worked hard to fight for me because it was a slap in her face that my grandma wanted to take care of me. But back to the point. I always say I hate alcohol because my mom partied on my behalf, and that is no joke. Even now, I remember being dragged to her pub crawls and the stories I hear from family members and friends, how she left me with my dad to disappear for a week to party and then call my dad all confused asking him to pick her up. We have family in the UK, not long after she left me with my dad to move to the UK for a ""better life"". She was there for 3 years. Thing is, my dad had 2 jobs by then and he couldn't take care of me alone. So he asked my grandpa if I can live there with him until he is stable enough. In that time my dad would visit every weekend and helped my grandad with everything he could. At some point my dad felt he is stable enough so he took me back and it was all good. Until my mom got back. 

The family in the UK says she made trouble in the UK and refused to sponsor her visa further and that is why she came back, and of course my mom denies it. With my mom back, my parents agreed to joint custody because that way my mom keeps some sort of freedom so I was with my mom every second week. That stopped the day my mom threw me with scissors. Yep. I was in Primary school and I had a speech to write and I wrote my own speech, I was so proud but my mom wrote one too and insisted I should use hers and I said no and she threw me with scissors. Till this day she makes jokes about the incident, she says she can be thankful it only hit my shoulder and didn't hit anything vital otherwise she would be in trouble. So I lived only with my dad and only visit I cant even remember how often but it was very little. Then when I was 12 my dad died. It sucked. 

I was told to move back to my moms. I still remember the day, she came to pick me up with her new rich boyfriend and I begged everyone to please not let this happen. Everyday since sucked. I was trying to cope with losing my dad, my mom and her boyfriend partied a lot till early mornings and then I had to go to school tired and keep up my grades otherwise I would get a hiding and be grounded for a semester. Don't get me wrong, the boyfriend was very kind to me and he always protected me but it was just a lot and I was so afraid of my own mom. One time I made her coffee in bed thinking if she is in a good mood today it would help so I put the coffee on her bed side table but when her alarm went off she bumped the coffee over and was yelling at me what a bad child I am. The boyfriend stood up for me and said it was an accident she shouldn't be so hard on me and then they had a big fight because he is not allowed to intervene with her relationship with me. My mom refused to take me to school so the boyfriend took me every morning and picked me up in the afternoon. In between this my mom would treat me so badly I basically had no self image as a young girl. Then in grade 10 the boyfriend decided he couldn't deal with this anymore so he left like a thief in the night. literally.

That was when things really took a turn for the worst. My mom was so hurt by the break up that she refused to come out of her room for a month. I had to cook, clean, feed the dogs, do homework, study, walk to the bus, go to school, come back and do it all on my own but unfortunately it even after she started coming out things didn't change. I had to cook, buy groceries, clean the house and do good in school and she told people its for my good to learn responsibility. When guests came I had to take the dishes away and clean them and everyone kept giving me that look. that im so sorry look. When I had a bad mark for anything she would give me a hiding with a belt that had a buckle on it. I was not allowed to give my opinion because that is considered talking back and if I did answer her she would say I am a know it all. In this time I begged my uncle if I could stay there but he said unfortunately I couldn't because the law is not on his side. I should also mention my mom has her own business in Law and everyone is afraid of her. I also had no contact with my grandma.

So I kept my head down and worked hard and got a full bursary offer to a university that was far to drive to. I thought perfect, I can get away from her. Then my mom said no I should study law I am not allowed to study anything else. I fought against it and she said no I will take over her business and that is it and if I fight further she will contact the university and tell them I cannot accept the offer and that she will lie to make sure I cant go. So I studied law and kept my head down. In that time I met my now husband and he helped me get a lot of confidence back to start standing up for myself as he saw how my mom was treating me. In my third year of law my mom was in the news because she was caught doing fraudulent things in her business because she does not have admission to practice. I was so embarrassed because my friends would send it to me asking me isn't this your mom. 

But then in the end of my third year my now husband got his first job and asked me to move with him as my studies were online after covid hit and we can start our life together. I was so excited but when I told my mom she was so angry, she started yelling at my now husband that he has no right to take me away and who does he think he is. That was the second time he stood up against her (the first time my mom wanted to hit me in my face and he saw her had go up and stood in between us and said she is never allowed to lay a hand on me again). I moved with my husband and then he asked me to marry him. We had a small wedding as I wanted but it wasn't without drama. The day before, my aunt called me to warn me that my mom is surprising me by coming to the wedding without permission. Then on the day of my wedding she came high as a kite and when my husband's grandmother was hugging me my mom came and told her ""hey I don't share"". I was so embarrassed. 

Then a few months after my mom said she had work in my area and asked if she could fly to us and use my car in that time to drive around. I agreed. The day after she borrowed my car she asked me if she can take a loan out on my car because she needs the money. I refused and she yelled at me and my husband that we never grant her anything in life and swore at us, left with the car. 2 days later my aunt called asking me if I am aware my mom sold me car. I was livid. So while I studied I had a car in both me and my moms name because the insurance would be cheaper. But I asked my mom numerous times to sign it over to me and she kept stalling. So now my car was sold and I was angry so I called her and you know what she said, sorry I was desperate I needed the money. I decided I am done with her and wrote her off. But she decided she cant accept it so she broke into our house to ""check up on me"". My husband threw her out of the house and she told the whole family we assaulted her.

I forgot to mention, when I started University my grandmother and I started connecting and got really close.

Well 2 years after I wrote off my mom, my grandma said she has a message from my mom, that she is taking pills and is so much better and she bought a car for me to make up for what she did. I contacted my mom and made up with her because it did seem like she changed for the better and she gave me the papers for the car. But 3 months later we asked for the car as was the agreement and she came with stories that she hasn't bought her own car yet and asked if she can still use it until she buys her own car. We said fine. Then this year January she tells us all excited she met a new man and he is wonderful. A week after they met he moves in. I know right, crazy but wait. A month later she marries this man. She wanted us to sign witness we said no and she got angry. My grandmother then calls saying she approves of this marriage and I should let go and let my mom be happy but the thing is she doesnt know everything like the fact that he was married when they started dating and my mom pulled strings to get them divorced quickly and he has a child that he doesnt speak to and he was married already 3 times. 

I still refused to sign witness and didnt want to go to the wedding because I had the flu but then like the chump I am I agreed I would be there to support even with me having flu. So there I am, high on fever sitting in the car that was seposed to be mine on the way to witness their crazy marriage. In this time small things keeps bottling up. The car, the way she treats me. A few examples, I decided to study further to be a bookkeeper as I want to rewrite my own story and she told me I am wasting my time, i have copper red hair and she said she doesnt like my hair colour I would look better in blond (she has blond hair), we are trying for a child and she says she is not babysitting and wants nothing to do with it, she smokes in our face when we visit and when I complained she said its her house we can leave, she tells other people I am spoiled because my husband makes good money and treats me well. She is also lying a lot to everyone. 

So the other day we had a nice day and my moms new husband who we barely know 2 months said my moms friend is borrowing money. We corrected him saying no when you and my mom almost broke up, the friend bought your guitar to help my mom with money but when you two got back together my mom took the guitar back and now the friend wants his money back. Well he didn't know about this and the next day my mom bursts in our house and starts yelling at us we had no right to speak about her behind her back without her permission. I lost it and yelled at my mom that she will not come in here and yell at us and then I apologised to her husband that he had to find out that way and I told my mom she should stop lying so much. She lost it and walked out, yelled at the people in the yard and left. Now I am sitting here thinking, is all this worth it. So here I am asking for advice, is it worth it to have a relationship with my mom? Should I continue and try and work on it or should I cut her off because here I am yet again hurt and angry and I am not sure if I can take any of this anymore.",1,1743278869.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

For context:  I am a 5'9"" female, late 30s, currently 174lbs.  I weighed 240lbs at 17.  I got down to the low 160s in my early 20s and mostly managed to maintain (gained a lot for my 2 pregnancies, both times managed to get back down), and until recently maintained around 163-165 for about the last 3-4 years.  I know how to lose weight.  I'm very disciplined and very knowledgeable about nutrition, and I generally maintain by eating intuitively.  If the scale goes up more than a couple of pounds, I start religiously weighing and tracking again and the weight always comes back off. 


Last year I tried a CPAP for 2 months and gained 10lbs rapidly without changing my lifestyle.  I learned that CPAP can cause hypercapnea (CO2 retention) in many people, which causes adipogenesis, which accelerates the production of fat cells, which causes weight gain.  My doctor ended up telling me the CPAP therapy wasn't working for me due to *numerous* reasons and I stopped using it, but the weight hasn't come off.


Since the beginning of February I've gone back to hardcore tracking.


6 days a week I stick **strictly** to 1200 calories, 90-110g protein, 50-70g fiber.  I weigh everything on a food scale and eat almost identically every day.  I plan out my entire day in advance and do not deviate.  I don't use cooking oils, drink my calories, take bites off my kids' plates, anything that can't be tracked.  I eat between 11am and 5 or 6pm and don't eat outside that window.


One day a week (date night) I do OMAD (one meal a day) and don't track on MyFitnessPal, but try to intuitively stick to my deficit.  I'll eat half my plate at the restaurant and have 2-3 alcoholic drinks (light beer or a shot of tequila with lime, no high-cal cocktails).


I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and do an hour on the Elliptical (I do not eat back my calories).  Another 2 times a week I do an hour on my mini stepper while my kids are at karate.  Other than that, I'm fairly sedentary.  I don't do weight training due to back and knee issues so I can't imagine I'm gaining much muscle.


All this to say, I am absolutely tracking accurately.  I know I'm in a deficit because whenever I do 1200 I get dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up too fast and I only have a bowel movement once every 3 days.


It's been almost 2 months now and I've only lost one pound.


I don't understand how at 5'9"" I could possibly *not* be losing at a very religious 1200 and working out several times a week.


I really, really don't need comments telling me I'm not counting accurately, as politely as I can ask.  I've been counting calories for 20 years and I've had great successes and I don't lie to myself.  I'm extremely disciplined.  I literally weigh grams of light mayo and track 5 calories for black coffee and teaspoons of spices.  I am not underestimating my caloric intake.  I'm not eating back exercise calories.  My one OMAD day a week I do not binge.


I need some insight as to why everything I've done in the past that has worked for me has suddenly no effect.  It's starting to weigh my spirit.  The thought of eating has become so stressful because I'm afraid of everything that enters my mouth and I get no joy in it anymore.

We're spending 3 days in Rome and then a full week in Naples (staying in Napoli proper). I tend to like the smaller towns that have a bit more of an authentic feel. My dream day is strolling with a great coffee and a pastry through a farmer's market and maybe sitting outside for lunch at a cafe. My husband loves history and architecture and anywhere with a beautiful view. 

I'm wondering what you would prioritize around Naples in terms of day trips that you felt were worth the time you spent there and/or if you felt like they offered something unique compared to other places nearby. Some places I'm curious about are:

* Capri
* Ischia
* Sorrento
* Positano
* Anywhere else you think is a must-see, do, or eat

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743278408.0,MrCreepyPasta,1,1.0,False

For context:  I am a 5'9"" female, late 30s, currently 174lbs.  I weighed 240lbs at 17.  I got down to the low 160s in my early 20s and mostly managed to maintain (gained a lot for my 2 pregnancies, both times managed to get back down), and until recently maintained around 163-165 for about the last 3-4 years.  I know how to lose weight.  I'm very disciplined and very knowledgeable about nutrition, and I generally maintain by eating intuitively.  If the scale goes up more than a couple of pounds, I start religiously weighing and tracking again and the weight always comes back off. 


Last year I tried a CPAP for 2 months and gained 10lbs rapidly without changing my lifestyle.  I learned that CPAP can cause hypercapnea (CO2 retention) in many people, which causes adipogenesis, which accelerates the production of fat cells, which causes weight gain.  My doctor ended up telling me the CPAP therapy wasn't working for me due to *numerous* reasons and I stopped using it, but the weight hasn't come off.


Since the beginning of February I've gone back to hardcore tracking.


6 days a week I stick **strictly** to 1200 calories, 90-110g protein, 50-70g fiber.  I weigh everything on a food scale and eat almost identically every day.  I plan out my entire day in advance and do not deviate.  I don't use cooking oils, drink my calories, take bites off my kids' plates, anything that can't be tracked.  I eat between 11am and 5 or 6pm and don't eat outside that window.


One day a week (date night) I do OMAD (one meal a day) and don't track on MyFitnessPal, but try to intuitively stick to my deficit.  I'll eat half my plate at the restaurant and have 2-3 alcoholic drinks (light beer or a shot of tequila with lime, no high-cal cocktails).


I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and do an hour on the Elliptical (I do not eat back my calories).  Another 2 times a week I do an hour on my mini stepper while my kids are at karate.  Other than that, I'm fairly sedentary.  I don't do weight training due to back and knee issues so I can't imagine I'm gaining much muscle.


All this to say, I am absolutely tracking accurately.  I know I'm in a deficit because whenever I do 1200 I get dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up too fast and I only have a bowel movement once every 3 days.


It's been almost 2 months now and I've only lost one pound.


I don't understand how at 5'9"" I could possibly *not* be losing at a very religious 1200 and working out several times a week.


I really, really don't need comments telling me I'm not counting accurately, as politely as I can ask.  I've been counting calories for 20 years and I've had great successes and I don't lie to myself.  I'm extremely disciplined.  I literally weigh grams of light mayo and track 5 calories for black coffee and teaspoons of spices.  I am not underestimating my caloric intake.  I'm not eating back exercise calories.  My one OMAD day a week I do not binge.


I need some insight as to why everything I've done in the past that has worked for me has suddenly no effect.  It's starting to weigh my spirit.  The thought of eating has become so stressful because I'm afraid of everything that enters my mouth and I get no joy in it anymore.

I hope this post finds you all well today. Please take a moment out of your day to take a trip with me as I descend into insanity.

I found out last night that my wife of 6 years has been cheating on me. We had a real fun argument all night long, she left and I don't believe she'll be back. I've been awake for 31 hours now, ate a bunch of gummies, and I find my spiraling mind thinking about Mr. Jeffrey Alan LaRocque. I think I'll tug on this string and see where it goes, because the other options hurt too much.

I feel like the entire JLR saga has gone from being hilarious and entertaining to something genuinely sad. How long do you realistically think Jeffrey can keep up his current pace? He's a 54 year old man with somewhat serious known medical conditions that survives on a purely fast food diet, lives in an environment that doesn't allow him to properly rest and recover, all while working 2 jobs and running his household to the best of his abilities. That would all be stressful enough without factoring in the unique situations with his wife and children, making peanuts for money, and his boss and coworkers talk down to him and make fun of him literally every day.

I really think we owe Jeffrey a bit of respect. He's been dealt a real shit hand from the day he was born and I really think he's trying to handle his life and his family to the best of his abilities. How many of you would be able to trade places with him? I sure as hell wouldn't want to. 

I don't know how the situation can improve, I'm just a dummy that fixes broke cars, but I really do hope something can be done by the show, iHeart, his brothers and family, the city, the state, some kind of charity, I don't really don't know. I just know the clock is ticking for this show. Most of us here believe that this is the final contract and someday not too far from now there won't be a Rover's Morning Glory. Do you expect Jeffrey's health and financial situation to be better after the show ends and he's not in the spotlight anymore? Nobody will step in and pay for and force him to go to the dentist to keep his rotten teeth in his head. No more listeners stepping in and helping with his busted ass car. 

I worry about this guy. It would be so wonderful if he could be paid for what he really is worth to the show. And I don't want to hear that he doesn't contribute anymore. No matter what he does, someone jumps on his case almost every time he speaks. Rover talks down to Jeffrey so, so badly, and Duji talks to him like he's a brain damaged 4 year old. But think of all of the gems Jeffrey has given us. How many of us use his Jeffrey-isms in your own life? I will for the rest of my life pause before I say Vietnamese. Everyone has a favorite JLR memory. He truly has been the golden goose of the show.

I get it, it's fun to laugh at Jeffrey. He's a funny guy that does funny things, but he's treated so poorly by his immediate bosses. Could you handle being belittled like that every day? They need to treat him like an intelligent adult. He's a weirdo, but he's not stupid.

Ok, I'm coming back up for air. See ya Monday. Maybe we'll get lucky and the show will start on time and everything will work, unless Snitzer runs another update, because that one never, ever stops being funny heh heh heh heh weird inhale laugh 🤣 ",1,1743278097.0,RoversMorningGlory,5,0.67,False

I hate them with all my heart, and they like to look at me like I'm shit even though I'm a cashier.on top of that, I'm alone on weekends and I have to take care of the cash register pumps, the bathroom, the coffee and the store refills

I work with my father and he tells me to ignore it but I can't, he and my boss talk about it like it's nothing and that I'm exaggerating everything

I'm at the point where as soon as I come to work I have a headache and I'm angry, I don't want to leave my house anymore because I see people as self-centered idiots.

They don't know which gas pump they used or the price. They don't understand the promotions even though everything is written down and if their card doesn't work or they forgot their PIN, it's my fault.Sometimes they come to the checkout and wait for me to guess what they want.

I don't know what to do or if it's me who's the problem, I need advice or an opinion,I know most of the customers are good but I don't know what to do

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743278014.0,mrcreeps,1,1.0,False

## what is the Breville Dual Boiler and Why Should You Care?

The Breville Dual Boiler is a semi-automatic espresso machine designed to bring professional-quality espresso into your home or smaller commercial setting. What sets it apart from many other home espresso machines is its dual boiler system. The machine features a dedicated boiler for brewing espresso and a separate boiler for steaming milk. This dual functionality means you can brew espresso and steam milk together, just like a professional barista. This is a significant upgrade from single-boiler machines, where you have to wait for the boiler to reach the appropriate temperature for each function, which can be both time-consuming and impact espresso quality. The Breville Dual Boiler BES920XL is the model that we will focus on throughout as this is the main variant in discussion.

For serious home baristas, the Breville Dual Boiler provides a level of control and consistency that is often lacking in less expensive machines. Small cafes and restaurants benefit from its relative affordability compared to full-fledged commercial machines, as well as its smaller footprint and ease of use. Experienced espresso machine users upgrading to the Breville Dual Boiler will appreciate its advanced features and ability to fine-tune brewing parameters.

## Decoding the Breville Dual Boiler's Key Features

Let’s delve into what makes the Breville Dual Boiler tick. We'll explore some of its most critically important components and technologies:

*   **Dual Boiler System:** The heart of this machine lies in its dual boiler heating system. A dedicated boiler for espresso brewing, equipped with PID temperature control, ensures optimal temperature stability. A separate boiler delivers instant and robust steam on demand. This means you can extract your espresso shot at the precise temperature needed for optimal flavor extraction while simultaneously steaming your milk for latte art. This is a cornerstone feature of the Breville Dual Boiler.

*   **PID Temperature Controller:** The PID (Proportional-Integral-derivative) temperature controller is essential for maintaining consistent water temperature during the brewing process. The PID accurately monitors and adjusts the temperature of the brew boiler. Precise temperature control is crucial for extracting the best flavors from your coffee beans and achieving repeatable results every time. With the integration of a PID controller both in the boiler and the brew head the temperature is always stable.

*   **Over Pressure Valve (OPV):** The Over Pressure Valve (OPV) limits the maximum pressure during extraction. Ideal espresso extraction occurs at around 9 bars of pressure. The OPV ensures that the pressure does not exceed this level which could cause bitter undesired flavours, resulting in a more balanced and flavorful shot.

*   **Pre-Infusion Function:** The Breville Dual Boiler features a pre-infusion function. This function gently saturates the coffee grounds with low-pressure water before the full 9 bars of pressure is applied.Pre-infusion allows the grounds to expand evenly, resulting in a more uniform extraction and improved flavor.

*   **Adjustable Settings:** The Breville Dual Boiler allows for extensive customization. Users can adjust brewing temperature, pre-infusion time, and pressure settings to fine-tune thier espresso extraction. This level of control is invaluable for experienced baristas who want to experiment with different coffee beans and roasting profiles.

*   **Programmable Shot Timers:** Consistency is key to great espresso. The Breville Dual Boiler includes programmable shot timers that allow you to consistently pull shots to your desired volume. This feature is especially helpful for maintaining consistency in a commercial setting or when serving multiple drinks.

*   **Build Quality & materials:** The Breville Dual Boiler is constructed with high-quality materials. Its stainless steel exterior provides durability and a professional aesthetic. While some components might potentially be plastic, they are generally well-engineered and contribute to the machine's overall longevity, though this is not without consideration to maintenance discussed later.

*   **E61 Group Head Design Consideration:** Although the Breville Dual Boiler group head design may not be a traditional E61, it boasts modern advancements. Breville has incorporated a PID controller in both the boiler and the brew head, assuring consistent temperature.[[Explore Top Rated breville dual boiler on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/vitamix/?kw=breville dual boiler)
## Assessing the Breville Dual Boiler Price and Value Proposition

The Breville Dual Boiler typically sits in the premium price range for home espresso machines. The cost falls within the ""prosumer"" category, positioning it between entry-level machines and high-end commercial models. As described by WIRED, purchasing the dual boiler is equivalent to purchasing a MacBook Pro, or an expensive television.

Whether the Breville Dual Boiler is ""worth it"" depends heavily on your individual needs and expectations.

**For Serious home Baristas:** Given professional-level espresso at home is the goal,and the willingness to invest significant money on equipment is not an issue,the Breville Dual Boiler can be a worthwhile investment. It provides the control, consistency, and features needed to achieve extraordinary espresso quality. The ability to fine-tune brewing parameters, experiment with different beans, and consistently pull high-quality shots makes it a worthwhile investment.

**For Small Cafes and Restaurants:** Where a reliable espresso machine for low-volume service, and a cost-effective solution compared to full commercial machines are the need, the breville Dual Boiler can be a practical choice.It offers a balance of performance, reliability, and ease of use at a more affordable price point than commercial machines. While it may not be suitable for high-volume environments, it can be a great option for smaller establishments.

**For Experienced Espresso Machine Users Upgrading:** Where current machine's performance is dissatisfying and more control and better the espresso quality is needed,the Breville dual Boiler offers a tangible upgrade. The improved temperature control, pre-infusion capabilities, and dual boiler system will allow for a noticeable advancement in espresso quality compared to entry-level machines.Considering that you will likely have already invested in an espresso grinder and other accessories, upgrading to the Breville Dual Boiler can be a natural progression.

## Breville Dual Boiler vs. the Competition: Exploring Alternatives.

While the Breville Dual Boiler offers a compelling package of features and performance, it's essential to consider alternatives before making a decision. Here's a comparison against some popular alternatives:

*   **Breville Dual Boiler vs.Profitec Pro 700:** The Profitec Pro 700 is a high-end, German-engineered espresso machine known for its robust build quality and precise temperature control. Unlike the Breville, the Profitec has an E61 group head, which is preferred by some for its heat stability. A key difference is that the Profitec is a vibration pump machine, whereas the Breville has an OPV to control the pump pressure. Typically, the profitec Pro 700 comes at a higher price point than the Breville Dual Boiler. if durability and aesthetics are of importance, and budget isn't a limiting factor, the Profitec Pro 700 is a worthwhile alternative to look at.

*   **Breville Dual Boiler vs. ECM Synchronika:** Similar to the profitec Pro 700, the ECM Synchronika is another premium espresso machine with an E61 group head and exceptional build quality. It features dual boilers, PID temperature control, and a rotary pump for quiet operation. Like the Profitec, the Synchronika is typically more expensive than the Breville Dual Boiler.

*   **Breville Dual Boiler Alternatives (Under $2000):** If your budget is a major concern,there are several excellent espresso machines under $2000.Machines from rancilio or Lelit may offer a good balance of performance and value. These machines may not have all the features of the Breville Dual Boiler, but they can still produce excellent espresso with the right technique and grinder.

When considering alternatives, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons of each machine based on your individual needs:

*   **Budget:** How much are you willing to spend on an espresso machine?
*   **Features:** Which features are most important to you (e.g., dual boilers, PID temperature control, pre-infusion)?
*   **Durability:** how important is long-term reliability?
*   **Ease of Use:** How easy is the machine to use and maintain?
*   **Aesthetics:** Do you prefer a modern or traditional design?

## Keeping Your Breville Dual Boiler running Smoothly: Maintenance and Care

Proper maintenance is crucial for ensuring the longevity and optimal performance of your Breville Dual Boiler. Here's a guide to regular cleaning and descaling:

*   **Daily Cleaning:** After each use, wipe down the exterior of the machine with a damp cloth. Flush the group head to remove any coffee grounds and clean the steam wand. These small efforts can prevent build up over time.*   **Backflushing:** Backflushing your espresso machine prevents buildup of coffee oils in the group head, extending the time before a more invasive and thorough cleaning is required. The regularity of this process would be dependent on usage. Refer to the Breville Dual Boiler user manual for specific instructions.

*   **Descaling:** Descaling removes mineral buildup from the boilers and water lines. The frequency of descaling depends on the hardness of your water but is generally recommended every 2-3 months. Use a descaling solution specifically designed for espresso machines. The Breville Dual Boiler has a built-in descaling program that makes the process easy and safe.

*   **Water Filter Replacement:** The Breville Dual Boiler uses a water filter to remove impurities and improve the taste of your espresso. Replace the water filter every 2-3 months, or as indicated by the machine's filter replacement indicator. The water filter provided by Breville is recommended, and can be purchased as an accessory.

Regular maintenance helps to prevent issues and keeps your Breville Dual Boiler running efficiently.

1jmulqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadameRavensDarlings/comments/1jmulqf/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743277833.0,MadameRavensDarlings,1,1.0,False

My mom had me when she was 17. When I was born, my grandmother fought in court for custody over me because she felt my mom and dad were too young to be able to properly take care of me. My mom fought against it and apparently told the court she would do anything to keep me. In this time I was living with my grandmother. Back then grandparents didn't really have much rights unless they could prove that your child is unfit of caring for a child. The court told my parents they can have me if my mom can get a job and hold it and it would be better if they married because a unity is better for the child. My mom did exactly what the court did and not long my parents could pick me up. By then my mom was already complaining that she missed all my firsts.

My parents married, well that was a struggle on its own. My mom is, well, difficult and my dad is, as everyone till this day says, is the calmest man they ever met. Everyone says they constantly fought and they did not have much money so they rented the garage of an old lady for us all to live in. The thing is, my mom did not really care much. All she wanted to do was party. Even now she tells people she worked hard to fight for me because it was a slap in her face that my grandma wanted to take care of me. But back to the point. I always say I hate alcohol because my mom partied on my behalf, and that is no joke. Even now, I remember being dragged to her pub crawls and the stories I hear from family members and friends, how she left me with my dad to disappear for a week to party and then call my dad all confused asking him to pick her up. We have family in the UK, not long after she left me with my dad to move to the UK for a ""better life"". She was there for 3 years. Thing is, my dad had 2 jobs by then and he couldn't take care of me alone. So he asked my grandpa if I can live there with him until he is stable enough. In that time my dad would visit every weekend and helped my grandad with everything he could. At some point my dad felt he is stable enough so he took me back and it was all good. Until my mom got back. 

The family in the UK says she made trouble in the UK and refused to sponsor her visa further and that is why she came back, and of course my mom denies it. With my mom back, my parents agreed to joint custody because that way my mom keeps some sort of freedom so I was with my mom every second week. That stopped the day my mom threw me with scissors. Yep. I was in Primary school and I had a speech to write and I wrote my own speech, I was so proud but my mom wrote one too and insisted I should use hers and I said no and she threw me with scissors. Till this day she makes jokes about the incident, she says she can be thankful it only hit my shoulder and didn't hit anything vital otherwise she would be in trouble. So I lived only with my dad and only visit I cant even remember how often but it was very little. Then when I was 12 my dad died. It sucked. 

I was told to move back to my moms. I still remember the day, she came to pick me up with her new rich boyfriend and I begged everyone to please not let this happen. Everyday since sucked. I was trying to cope with losing my dad, my mom and her boyfriend partied a lot till early mornings and then I had to go to school tired and keep up my grades otherwise I would get a hiding and be grounded for a semester. Don't get me wrong, the boyfriend was very kind to me and he always protected me but it was just a lot and I was so afraid of my own mom. One time I made her coffee in bed thinking if she is in a good mood today it would help so I put the coffee on her bed side table but when her alarm went off she bumped the coffee over and was yelling at me what a bad child I am. The boyfriend stood up for me and said it was an accident she shouldn't be so hard on me and then they had a big fight because he is not allowed to intervene with her relationship with me. My mom refused to take me to school so the boyfriend took me every morning and picked me up in the afternoon. In between this my mom would treat me so badly I basically had no self image as a young girl. Then in grade 10 the boyfriend decided he couldn't deal with this anymore so he left like a thief in the night. literally.

That was when things really took a turn for the worst. My mom was so hurt by the break up that she refused to come out of her room for a month. I had to cook, clean, feed the dogs, do homework, study, walk to the bus, go to school, come back and do it all on my own but unfortunately it even after she started coming out things didn't change. I had to cook, buy groceries, clean the house and do good in school and she told people its for my good to learn responsibility. When guests came I had to take the dishes away and clean them and everyone kept giving me that look. that im so sorry look. When I had a bad mark for anything she would give me a hiding with a belt that had a buckle on it. I was not allowed to give my opinion because that is considered talking back and if I did answer her she would say I am a know it all. In this time I begged my uncle if I could stay there but he said unfortunately I couldn't because the law is not on his side. I should also mention my mom has her own business in Law and everyone is afraid of her. I also had no contact with my grandma.

So I kept my head down and worked hard and got a full bursary offer to a university that was far to drive to. I thought perfect, I can get away from her. Then my mom said no I should study law I am not allowed to study anything else. I fought against it and she said no I will take over her business and that is it and if I fight further she will contact the university and tell them I cannot accept the offer and that she will lie to make sure I cant go. So I studied law and kept my head down. In that time I met my now husband and he helped me get a lot of confidence back to start standing up for myself as he saw how my mom was treating me. In my third year of law my mom was in the news because she was caught doing fraudulent things in her business because she does not have admission to practice. I was so embarrassed because my friends would send it to me asking me isn't this your mom. 

But then in the end of my third year my now husband got his first job and asked me to move with him as my studies were online after covid hit and we can start our life together. I was so excited but when I told my mom she was so angry, she started yelling at my now husband that he has no right to take me away and who does he think he is. That was the second time he stood up against her (the first time my mom wanted to hit me in my face and he saw her had go up and stood in between us and said she is never allowed to lay a hand on me again). I moved with my husband and then he asked me to marry him. We had a small wedding as I wanted but it wasn't without drama. The day before, my aunt called me to warn me that my mom is surprising me by coming to the wedding without permission. Then on the day of my wedding she came high as a kite and when my husband's grandmother was hugging me my mom came and told her ""hey I don't share"". I was so embarrassed. 

Then a few months after my mom said she had work in my area and asked if she could fly to us and use my car in that time to drive around. I agreed. The day after she borrowed my car she asked me if she can take a loan out on my car because she needs the money. I refused and she yelled at me and my husband that we never grant her anything in life and swore at us, left with the car. 2 days later my aunt called asking me if I am aware my mom sold me car. I was livid. So while I studied I had a car in both me and my moms name because the insurance would be cheaper. But I asked my mom numerous times to sign it over to me and she kept stalling. So now my car was sold and I was angry so I called her and you know what she said, sorry I was desperate I needed the money. I decided I am done with her and wrote her off. But she decided she cant accept it so she broke into our house to ""check up on me"". My husband threw her out of the house and she told the whole family we assaulted her.

I forgot to mention, when I started University my grandmother and I started connecting and got really close.

Well 2 years after I wrote off my mom, my grandma said she has a message from my mom, that she is taking pills and is so much better and she bought a car for me to make up for what she did. I contacted my mom and made up with her because it did seem like she changed for the better and she gave me the papers for the car. But 3 months later we asked for the car as was the agreement and she came with stories that she hasn't bought her own car yet and asked if she can still use it until she buys her own car. We said fine. Then this year January she tells us all excited she met a new man and he is wonderful. A week after they met he moves in. I know right, crazy but wait. A month later she marries this man. She wanted us to sign witness we said no and she got angry. My grandmother then calls saying she approves of this marriage and I should let go and let my mom be happy but the thing is she doesnt know everything like the fact that he was married when they started dating and my mom pulled strings to get them divorced quickly and he has a child that he doesnt speak to and he was married already 3 times. 

I still refused to sign witness and didnt want to go to the wedding because I had the flu but then like the chump I am I agreed I would be there to support even with me having flu. So there I am, high on fever sitting in the car that was seposed to be mine on the way to witness their crazy marriage. In this time small things keeps bottling up. The car, the way she treats me. A few examples, I decided to study further to be a bookkeeper as I want to rewrite my own story and she told me I am wasting my time, i have copper red hair and she said she doesnt like my hair colour I would look better in blond (she has blond hair), we are trying for a child and she says she is not babysitting and wants nothing to do with it, she smokes in our face when we visit and when I complained she said its her house we can leave, she tells other people I am spoiled because my husband makes good money and treats me well. She is also lying a lot to everyone. 

So the other day we had a nice day and my moms new husband who we barely know 2 months said my moms friend is borrowing money. We corrected him saying no when you and my mom almost broke up, the friend bought your guitar to help my mom with money but when you two got back together my mom took the guitar back and now the friend wants his money back. Well he didn't know about this and the next day my mom bursts in our house and starts yelling at us we had no right to speak about her behind her back without her permission. I lost it and yelled at my mom that she will not come in here and yell at us and then I apologised to her husband that he had to find out that way and I told my mom she should stop lying so much. She lost it and walked out, yelled at the people in the yard and left. Now I am sitting here thinking, is all this worth it. So here I am asking for advice, is it worth it to have a relationship with my mom? Should I continue and try and work on it or should I cut her off because here I am yet again hurt and angry and I am not sure if I can take any of this anymore.",1,1743277701.0,AmITheJerk,0,0.67,False

I’m going through something that I never imagined would happen in my relationship, and I need some advice.

I (F/27) have been with my fiancé, Mason (M/29), for 4 years, and we’ve been engaged for 6 months. We’ve always had a solid relationship built on trust and communication, but last week, I stumbled upon something that shook me. I found a few texts on his phone between him and his ex-girlfriend, Sarah (F/28). The texts were flirtatious, and they made plans to meet up for coffee.

Naturally, I was devastated. I immediately thought that he was cheating on me, or at the very least, emotionally involved with her. I confronted him about it, and, to my surprise, he didn’t deny it. But then he dropped a bombshell I wasn’t expecting.

Mason told me that they’d been talking because Sarah was having pre-wedding stress. She was about to get married to someone else, and she reached out to him for advice. He assured me their communication had nothing romantic—it was simply him helping an old friend. He also apologized for not telling me about it beforehand, as he didn’t realize it would upset me.

At first, I was relieved that it wasn’t infidelity, but I still feel a bit uneasy. I’m struggling with how to handle this. I know he has a valid explanation, but I’m torn between trusting him and feeling like it’s a boundary I wasn’t comfortable with.

**How do I navigate rebuilding trust in this situation while still maintaining boundaries in a relationship? How can I communicate my discomfort without making it seem like I don’t trust him?**",3,1743277640.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False
1jmui4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jmui4o/what_else_should_i_do_to_succeed/,What else should I do to succeed?,"Hey yall. Looking for some possible advice on what I can do to improve my weight loss goals.

Starting weight : 280lbs, current weight: 268lbs, goal weight: 200lbs (for now. I am hoping that 200 by roughly end of the year is a reasonable goal.) F(27), 5 foot 4. 

What I've done so far: cut most processed foods(aside from occasional cheat days), eating low carbs most days, got myself drinking a minimum of 64 ounces of water daily, getting to the gym twice a week on average - when I am at the gym I usually do one to two hours and I try to focus on all areas. So I'll run, weightlift, use various machines, all in the same session rather than focusing on one area. Hitting 10K steps most days. I try to count calories but this is something I need to improve in. I'm certain I'm not in a calorie deficit as my cheat days and alcohol consumption are likely throwing me. 



What's next: starting in April my plan is to get more consistent with counting calories. Cut the cheat days. Cut alcohol entirely. I'm unsure what my current calories average consumption looks like but I'm guessing starting at aiming for no more than 1,800 per day would be both achievable and sustainable. Push myself to make the gym three times a week minimum, push to get my daily steps up to 12K (with a future goal to push more but I am trying to start with a reasonable goal.) My water intake will hopefully go up as I push myself to move more though no set number of ounces aside from still meeting my 64 minimum. And then the big part I'm not 100% sure is healthy and definitely feels like will be the big hurdle, I want to at least for one whole month cut grains and dairy. I don't believe I'm sensitive to them but my hope is cutting them out for a while with a slow reintroduction will hopefully both give me information on if there is a sensitivity to them that I'm just not clocking and also better moderation for them in the future. Dairy especially is an area where I know I'm eating more than I should (the cheese gets me 😩) This means my diet will consist mostly of proteins and vegetables. I will try to not do a lot of fruit as I'm hoping to be as low carb as reasonably possible. I will also measure my coffee creamer (switching to a coconut one probably?) instead of guesstimating it for calorie counting (I should probably also reduce my coffee intake lol I think I drink like at least 5 cups a day) And I need to improve my sleep, I know that as well. (I stay up late to reclaim my time but end up with 5-7 hours of sleep.) 


So friends. Is there anything I'm particularly missing in my efforts to improve? Is my plan dangerous? Much as I want the weight gone, I am trying to be careful to not do so dangerously. Am I focusing in the wrong areas? Reality is I don't really know what I'm doing, a nutritionist or any form of coach is not an option for me to utilize because of my 2 jobs and their limited availability. But I'm sick to death of the weight and I need to make changes to improve. Just not at all sure if I'm making the right ones. 


Your thoughts and advice is appreciated!

1jmuhvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/1jmuhvx/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743277543.0,JustNotRight,2,1.0,False

1jmufw4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmufw4,The Adventure of a First Time Pioneer Completing 1.0 (Part 3),"End game is now complete and thinking you've built all the main different styles for power generation, except you haven't built all the possible ways. The pinnacle of power comes from production of the alien power matrix getting fed into the alien augmenter for that spicy boost to the main grid. Easy build to do and was a relatively small modular factory. The only issue i ran into was the lack of superstition oscillators since everything in my phase 5 factory was perfectly balanced at 100% and i wasn't going to rebuild an entire new assembly line to add production for these pieces. Overclocking would have messed with the entire assembly line machines so that was not happening. The easiest solution was to cut off production of the ballistic warp drives as they were no longer needed and sloop the quantum encoder for the necessary output/throughput required for the drone port. All the excess was simply moved into the SINK. While building this smaller factory i realized i can intertwine ionized fuel now that i had to make synthetic power shards. Scrapped the rocket fuel from the jet pack to try this new fuel type. This would have been really nice to have in earlier phases with how much longer this lasts on top of having solid thrust.  
  
With everything up and running this factory turned into a cool show piece for the augmenter. The location was in a spot where you can oversee the rocket fuel factory and all of phase 3 factories. Nice touch to the quality of life for this pioneer. There was only one last thing to really conquer and it includes the fastest way to travel in this game, the pinnacle of mobility is the teleporter! I had no idea this was a thing until phase 5 was unlocked. Once again running into another production issue for singularity cells that the teleporters need to be fed to i didn't take account for. My one and only manufacturer building these was capped by the nuclear past feed so overclocking was not going to work. This manufacturer was already slooped because they we're needed for the ficsonium in the nuclear plant that wasn't accounted for either. The saving grace was the fact i didn't have to produce the ballistic warp drives and it freed up enough of the cells to feed the teleporter continuously. Knowing that these are in the game i would have planned to make a central hub for these but that will end up being for the next playthrough since i don't have enough singularity cells to go around.

Surely that's everything this game offers right? Not quite, there's a couple of more tasks to tackle before calling this game 100%. This pioneer had to finish off the last of the achievements which included the golden nut statue. Thankfully while i was building these last few factories that the tickets got racked up but i was still shy of around 250 tickets. Well, what's the best way to get tickets extremely fast? A full MRK6 belt into an awesome sink feeding every single ballistic drive that was in storage. My goodness i haven't seen the points per minute go to such insane numbers and how fast tickets we're getting spat out! Didn't take long to get the rest of those 250 tickets with the alien protein on top. Before I know it I'm holding the golden nut statue in my hands.

With this achievement out of the way i had a thought to do a build to remember this first run. The Grand Gala was the name I have given it. This was a place to reflect and realize just how far you came into this game, alongside with a great view of the first beginning factories. This was my 100% I was looking for by finishing the extra curricular activities. 

Some end notes: This first run has about 650 hours in and not everything has been shown except the main takes of the playthrough. This game was awesome and really brought the nostalgia of the LEGO like building from my younger days. To be able to build whatever came to my mind as you're only limited to your imagination. Eventually I'd like to add a FICMAS factory into this save and fill up the gala with the festivities since it's a bit empty at the moment. With the 1.1 update literally around the corner from the time of writing this, I may continue the decorating around this world by going into experimental. For now a break is needed before coming back thinking about a second run.

1jmufd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanGrupeHorror/comments/1jmufd4/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743277351.0,JordanGrupeHorror,1,1.0,False

I know that the dating scene is pretty rough now days with online dating. When you meet someone online you never know if it's a scam, meal taker or just not interested in actually getting to know you. So to save yourself the trouble, set a limit. 

This limit may change from person to person but in all honesty it really shouldn't. Most men are EXPECTED STILL to pay for a first date. I am not saying that it's right or wrong but since that is the case, choose cheaply. Do a coffee meeting. Talk a walk. Go to a park for a home made picnic. There is a wide variety of options that you can do that require little to no money. Why would you spend 100 bucks every time you meet someone when you know nothing about them? Meet first and see if there is anything there.

Does their chemistry feel good to you? Do they seem genuine? Are they upset that you went the more spendthrift route? Knowing these things can tell you if there is even a reason to continue investing time, effort and resources into it. If you realize right off that bat that it wouldn't work then you have saved yourself the trouble and some money while you are at it. 

Ladies. This isn't me saying he should not treat you well or take you out to a nice place. Just not when you are first meeting. Take the time to get to know someone first before you expect them to drop some bigger amounts of money on a date. This will help you understand a bit better also. If the guy is willing to blow hundreds of dollars just to meet you, where else is he going to compulsively spend money? Would you prefer a partner who is more interested in being smart and thrifty, or who will blow everything he has on somethings he thinks he might want before he knows for sure?

Remove the standard about the first meeting being some nice dinner or concert or big deal and instead look for the smaller stuff. Money will be an important factor in any relationship and both sides normally want to be secure in how their partner views the gaining and spending of money. Don't be mad or think he isn't interested in you because he is being ""cheap"". Most of the time that isn't the case at all. He just wants to know that it's an investment that might be going somewhere instead of just giving money away.",0,1743277292.0,dating_advice,6,0.44,False

I’m in an odd situation. Over the past 2 weeks, my brews have gotten significantly more sour and salty. Like, we’re talking very vulgar acidity.

I brew with Lance Hedrick’s 1:2:1 V60 recipe using a Stagg EKG kettle, DF54 grinder set between 55-60, Cafec T90 filter papers, and light to medium-light roasted coffees from local roasters (Craig’s Coffee, Hyperion, etc).

I brew with a typical bloom time of 45-60s, a flow rate of 6-8g/s, a temp of 94-95C, and total draw down time around 2:30.

I’ve tried grinding finer, adjusting brews temp, splitting up my pours, changing my ratio, etc all with the same vulgar acidity.

The only other variable I’ve changed recently is switching from Brita-filtered tap water to TWW diluted to 1/2 to 1/3 original recipe with distilled water.

At first I thought I just didn’t like the TWW, so then I switched back to filtered tap water and my brews are still very sour. 

Is it possible some of the minerals from the TWW are trapped in my kettle spout and impacting flavor somehow? Could the distilled water have interacted with the metal coating of the kettle despite not causing limescale or corrosion?

Any insight would be appreciated!",1,1743277255.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I live in a larger city, while Joe lives in our hometown. A week ago he drove up here to visit, and we planned on making the rounds to a bunch of video games stores. 

We started at a game shop in the local mall, and he was cashed out by a female employee. I didn't pay attention to her or their interaction as I was browsing the Pokémon display they had. We leave the mall, and I see that he has a wide grin on his face. I assume he was just happy that he got to have a pleasant conversation about his interests with another person.

The day goes by without mention of the interaction, until he is dropping me back off at my place. He tells me that she asked him about a show that he went to recently (he was wearing the shirt he got from it), and she says, ""you'll have to let me know when they're preforming again"". I took it as her having a simple conversation, but he said he was planning on coming back to the city the following Saturday anyways, and figured he should stop in and talk to her again.

I told him to just be careful, and to not come off as pushy, but I truly thought he would forget about it within the day. About two hours after he drops me off and heads back home, I get this series of messages.

Joe: ""Still thinking about that employee, I think this is what they call ""terminal"". The funny part is that I'm thinking like, oh she's cute AND she's a Sonic fan but even funnier is I'm thinking that I need to complete the task she gave first before I can ask her out.""

Joe: ""The fact that she gave me a task and DAMMIT even if it doesn't go anywhere I will fulfill my duty.""

Joe: I just realized that she could've been hitting on me asking that. Fuck.""

The task was her telling Joe to ""let her know about any future show dates""

The next Saturday rolls around, he goes to the store and asks her for coffee. She tells him that she is in a tight spot, but to ask again next time he was in. He THEN hints about taking her to the show that they were discussing, and she says they would, ""have to see when it gets closer"".

Maybe this is where I was too harsh, but I tell him this. ""coming from a woman, I would honestly call it here if I were you. if she didn't offer to give you a number or any form of contact then she's probably not interested. and I'm not saying that to be harsh, I promise. I think that going up there for the purpose of asking her about coffee again would be a bad move, and may creep her out a bit. once again, I know you have no ill intentions, but I'm trying to think about this from her perspective.""

He says that this is another demonstration of how he doesn't understand people, and that clearly he is missing something since he's the only one who thoughts it didn't go badly. He said he doesn't wanna discuss it further, and has been silent ever since. So, AITA?",1,1743277198.0,AmItheAsshole,6,0.67,False
1jmucu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1jmucu0/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743277154.0,joinmeatthecampfire,1,1.0,False

Major burning/cramping feeling around belly button or sometimes higher..always with non stop burping. BUT I have not had any bowel issues at all nor have I vomited. I've tried all the anti acids and gas pills with no luck. Pepto does help relieve the pain, but haven't had luck in preventing.

Yesterday I bought some lactaid as a last resort even though I've had a dairy heavy diet my entire 37 years of life with no issue.

Lactose intolerance wasn't on my radar because I've never had issue with it and I thought lactose intolerance = diarrhea. Other than morning coffee, I only drink water and eat lots of veggies and berries so I'm used to having healthy bowel movements and that has not changed. It's just like super painful digestion but nothing bad coming out of my body on either end?

1jmu94y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyBonfire/comments/1jmu94y/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days.

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",2,1743276870.0,CreepyBonfire,1,1.0,False

1jmu8fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jmu8fu/caffeine_and_compassion_fatigue/,Caffeine and compassion fatigue,"Hi, I wanted to write about my recent experience quitting caffeine.  I dropped coffee about two months ago after acknowledging how I feel it impacts my behaviour negatively, plus the dietary reset of a stomach bug.

I work in healthcare and having control of my emotions and attitude is very important to me to ensure I can best help the patients I interact with. Being off caffeine, I have felt much more centred in myself - more present, more controlled, and finding it much easier to act in alignment with my values. My conversations, facial expressions and attitude all come across more as I would like to be.  It’s great!

I don’t like who I become on caffeine. Sure, I feel a bit more lively and funny for an hour or so, and I think that can help patients, but the after-effects last for hours. It’s the overall unpleasantness, feeling anxious, more easily agitated… more impatient.  These traits are not helpful for inducing compassion!

Anyway. Last week on a night shift I was really tired, so I broke my caffeine-free streak and had a can of coke and a few sips of coffee.  It was enough to noticeably impact my performance.  I see it reflected in how people react and talk to me - my subtly altered behaviours and words don’t sit so well with others, or I do things more hastily with less thought behind them which I wouldn’t normally do.  With the increase in anxiety, thoughts of negative self-talk start appearing, so I become less focused on others and more on myself.

It’s hard when it’s 4am and I’m really tired. I want to work safely as well.  But there must be alternative ways to keep me awake. I try eating snacks, face splashing, skin pinching, dancing on the spot - if you know any good ones, let me know!

I’d be curious to hear if anyone else has noticed a kind of dampening of compassion or other things when they drink coffee. ",2,1743276816.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Coming from the foothills, the theater was on the left side of the freeway. The exit consisted of two off-ramps. The first ramp headed to the right, away from the theater and into various housing projects. The second ramp looped around, heading to the left and to the theater. We could have easily made it there on time by taking the second ramp. However, either because of our continued distraction with the Garbage Bin Incident, or the fact that we were clueless hillbillies unfamiliar with basic urban planning, we took the first ramp toward the housing projects. Then we realized we had screwed up.

As captain of the Blue Bomber, it was Sam’s duty to make executive decisions when called for. And with four minutes to spare before our movie would start without us, it was that time.

The road we were on had two lanes in each direction, separated by a double yellow line. The next light where we could flip a U-turn was quite a distance away. This area was also rife with “No U-Turn” signs, so who knows when we would have been able to do that. No, the safest bet was just to turn it around then and there.

At this moment, the town was buzzing with placid yuppies on their way to coffee shops to meet friends, to chain restaurants for dinner, to blind dates set up through coworkers, and to evening strip mall shopping trips. And in the middle of it was a huge blue Ford with a gurgling muffler, an aluminum camper shell and seven or so teens crammed inside with two bean bag chairs and a mirror ball. Sam checked his mirrors and blind spot, cranked the wheel, and guided the truck into a free-range U-turn across two lanes of traffic.

The problem was the truck's naval destroyer handling gave it an extra-wide turning radius, and our course looked to take us onto the opposite shoulder. On this shoulder, stretching from guard rail to traffic lane, was a white construction barricade with yellow reflectors and a sign reading ""End."" There was no sign of construction anywhere, as if the thing were placed there just for this exact scenario. Evidently, someone wanted this stunt to “end”.

Three minutes until the movie started. Three seconds before impact, and the wheel was cranked as far as it would go. This was fate. Sam shrugged and held the wheel steady.

""I hope that's not steel,"" he said. The words would be immortalized in senior quote Valhalla.

The barricade splintered like balsa wood, disintegrating with a loud CLACK and littering the street with white, reflective toothpick shrapnel. Sam grinned like he had won a boxing match of sorts, and the hyenas went ballistic. A guy in a BMW frantically beeped his horn in an attempt to pull us over. We ignored him.

Four minutes and thirty seconds later we were in our seats, snacks and sodas in hand. The movie hadn’t started yet, because apparently they put 20 minutes of previews in front of them. Who could have guessed? Either way, the outside world, including our list of ruined property thus far, could go screw itself.

After the movie ended we resettled back in our hometown, sitting on the bleachers of the community pool and recapping the night. The movie was entertaining but otherwise sucked. The drive was spectacular.

Unbeknownst to us, the garbage cans of the town were bent on getting even. There were three of them, the metal kind, floating right there in the pool. We had barely noticed them, and hadn’t even given a thought to how they got there. But the two sheriff's officers in the squad car parked under the trees nearby, they had an idea.

Part 3 to come.

The myth of a bogeyman hiding under the bed came true for one Kansas family this week after a child's complaint led to a man's arrest.

The Barton County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that it responded to reports of a disturbance at a house outside the city of Great Bend on Monday.

The unnamed babysitter told authorities that she was getting the kids ready for bed when one complained about a ""monster"" under their bed. Her efforts to reassure them otherwise didn't go quite as planned.

""When the victim attempted to show the child there was nothing under the bed, she came face-to-face with a male suspect who was hiding there,"" the sheriff's office statement said. ""An altercation ensued with the babysitter and one child was knocked over in the struggle.""

The suspect is a 27-year-old man who ""once lived at the residence,"" the statement says, but who was under a ""protection from abuse order"" that required him to stay away from the property.

NPR is not publishing his name because whether he has been charged in connection with this incident is unclear. Online court records cited by CNN and KAKE News show he posted bond about 10 days earlier after being charged with criminal threat, domestic battery and violating a protection from abuse order related to incidents in January and February.

NPR has reached out to the sheriff's office and Barton County Attorney for more information.

The statement says the suspect fled the scene before deputies arrived on Monday night, but was spotted in the area and, after a ""short foot pursuit,"" taken into custody the next morning.

He was arrested on charges of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated burglary, aggravated battery, child endangerment, felony obstruction of a law enforcement officer and violation of a protection from abuse order, the statement says.

According to the statement, the man is being held in county jail in lieu of a $500,000 bond. It is not clear whether he has retained a lawyer.

While fears of someone hiding under the bed are ubiquitous, they don't materialize very often.

In 2006, a former Washington, D.C., hospital valet was sentenced to more than three years in prison for stalking a hospital employee. He allegedly made copies of her keys, snuck a video camera onto her dresser and hid under her bed for two nights before he was discovered by the woman's boyfriend.

Ah! He is laughing. He is laughing the same laugh just with some lines and greys, this laugh the glimpse of which I never saw in the past 10 years. The glimpse for which I made myself better only to be told I can never be so. And now he is laughing the same laugh with strangers. Oh now we too are just...strangers.Does that mean he will laugh at me now? But he doesn't even look at me. Can he even look at me? Will I still disgust him?

But we weren't strangers once. Once we were something. Once my love used to be reciprocated, ten folds probably. It was really long ago and it does seem like something I just manifested, but once it was and it was I who was loved first, yearned for first. And then too this same laugh took my heart. And a bit too readily I gave it, a bit too easily. And I didn't take it back, even when he let it go, I couldn't take it back. 

Well they seem to be talking about something interesting. I can't hear it though. I wish I could. 

Seems now they are getting up. Looks like she is asking for him to contact her again. Not that he would. He keeps on looking for someone better, better than the better before.

1jmu6j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jmu6j2/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743276668.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

There are five of us, and for the most part, we get along really well–except for one person: Shila (22F). And I feel bad even saying that because she isn’t mean or intentionally awful… she’s just exhausting.  

The thing is, a lot of the stuff she does isn’t even that different from what we do. But when she does it, it’s unbearable.  

Like, we all procrastinate on assignments sometimes, but Shila never actually does them. She’ll always text the group chat last minute, asking for someone to send her theirs so she can “just check something real quick.” At first, we helped her out because, hey, we all struggle sometimes. But then it became a pattern. She never puts in effort during group projects either. She’ll say she’s “so swamped” with other work (which, again, she doesn’t do) and end up doing the bare minimum while the rest of us pick up the slack. Then, when we call her out, she plays it off like it’s not a big deal or jokes about how she’s “so bad at this stuff.”  

She’s also just… annoying in small ways that add up. We all talk over each other sometimes, but Shila does it in a way that derails conversations. We’ll be discussing weekend plans, and she’ll cut in with a completely random story about how her roommate took her coffee mug. And she won’t stop. It’s like she doesn’t notice when people aren’t interested.  

We also joke around a lot, but Shila always takes it one step too far. If someone makes a self-deprecating joke, she’ll pile on instead of reading the room. One time, I was stressed about my grades and joked, “Guess I’m just gonna fail this class.” And she went, “I mean, you don’t really take notes, so…” It was weirdly blunt and stung more than it should have.  

Lately, we’ve been low-key avoiding her. Not outright excluding her, but we don’t invite her to last-minute study sessions because we know she’ll just ask for answers instead of contributing. She recently confronted us, saying she feels like she’s being left out. And now I feel guilty.  

AITA for disliking her when some of the things she does are things we all do—just in a way that makes us hate it?

What should I do?,"Hello.Let me tell you about my situation: I (32 F) have been married for about 4 years. A couple of months after the wedding, I found—by checking WhatsApp—conversations between my husband (30 M) and a woman he had recently met, at that time through work/studies. In addition to speaking somewhat flirtatiously, he was sending her photos, like pictures of random things we saw during our honeymoon (like ""look at this rock here in the valley""), and there were also more recent flirtatious conversations. I confronted him about the situation because this woman was responding flirtatiously as well. I also found another inappropriate conversation with a different woman, but this second woman didn’t respond in a flirtatious way. He told me it was nothing, and that he didn’t know how to approach people, which is why he talked to them like that, making double entendres and things like that.

Later, I met both women. It turned out that the first woman was indeed sassy, cheeky, and flirtatious, while the second one was reasonable and serious. We agreed that my husband would change the way he approached people and avoid using flirtatious or double entendre language.

Some time later, the cheeky woman requested to join a work rotation at my husband's workplace, and he encouraged her to continue in that job. Months later, it turns out she started studying and working at the SAME place as my husband. I was frustrated because, essentially, he stayed involved with someone he knows I don’t trust and don’t get along with, and there had already been conflict over this. My husband had even encouraged her to join that workplace. This happened last year. We had a serious argument, and he told me he didn’t know what to do and asked me to tell him what he should and shouldn’t do. I insisted that this wouldn’t be helpful unless he became aware of his behavior. We went to couples therapy. We agreed that he would only deal with her on the obvious, unavoidable work-related matters, and not do things like have coffee or lunch with her or anything extra. He also promised to keep me informed about what was going on.
 
Now, almost a year later, I checked his WhatsApp again and discovered that he has been in close friendship with this woman all this time, almost like best friends. He calls her “queen” and “the best,” they regularly go out for coffee and lunch, he picks her up and drops her off on his bike, and the most upsetting part was reading a message where she invited him to see her “new house” but told him, “wait for me, I’m going to shower and then I’ll be ready.” This has been going on for months, and I had no idea about any of it.

We have two children and three pets. I don’t know what to do.

1jmu46k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jmu46k/how_do_i_get_my_girlfriend_to_become_more_serious/,How do I get my girlfriend to become more serious about her finances?,"I’ve (M29) been dating my girlfriend (F27) for almost 3 years. We’ve recently moved in together and are generally on the same page about finances. We split half of everything, rent bills etc. Marriage means split accounts and a joint account for marriage related expenses like house, food, childcare, etc. That’s all fine and good with me and her. 

Except I’ve stressed to her plenty of times how important retirement, investments, and savings are. I’ve even explained to her that’s unless we get on the same page financially then I don’t think I can marry her. This conversation was about 4 or 5 months ago. 

So I contribute well to my 401k, I max out my Roth IRA, invest in assets within my Roth IRA, have a HYSA for savings, have various CDs to hedge against falling interest rates. I diversify my investments very well. I also have a fantastic budgeting subscription (shoutout YNAB) that gives me clarity on my monthly expenses. 

My girlfriend does the absolute bare minimum. She has a 403b through her school. (She’s a teacher). I have asked her countless times to figure out how to log in and manage this account. (I’m assuming there’s some portal or something that she can log into to view how much money she has, what it’s being invested it, etc.) but she just refuses to. She never takes the initiative. Before meeting me, she never even had a Roth IRA because her mom told her that’s “stupid” and a “waste of time” and “she’d be better else putting money elsewhere”. I highly disagreed, encouraged her to open a Roth, so she did. But she hasn’t invested a cent because she doesn’t really know how. Which is fine but I’ve given her every opportunity to come to me and I can teach her the basics, but again she shows zero initiative. 

Finally, I encouraged her to begin a budget so she can see where her money is going, how much she’s spending on things, etc (She has a habit of going to Starbucks, or Chick Fil A, which is fine in moderation but knowing how much money she’s spending on coffee every month can be very eye opening.) So she started a YNAB account but after 3 months of using it, she said it’s a bit confusing and not intuitive based on how she saves money. So she quit using it. She said she’ll sit down and use EXCEL instead since that’s how she did it in the past but I’ve yet to see her even start that yet. 

It’s like she has absolutely 0 initiative to handle her finances when I’ve stressed time and time again how important they are for her future and to me. 

What can I say or do that I’ve not already done to convince her to take this stuff seriously?

Overall really great (mostly!),"Family of four from California, kids are 5 and 8. Also for context, we stayed off-property in Val d'Europe, and our second time visiting!

**The Good (and the great!)**

* Just moderately busy! Most rides were 30-40 minutes at most, and wait times mostly accurate. Few rides down throughout the day but recovered!
* Cast members - The cast were so kind to our family this trip, our kids talked to ALL OF THEM and they were so patient and caring. Love the Pirates crew for being extra cool later in the evening, letting riders do second (third?!) rides! Autopia crew was especially awesome as well!
* Birthday buttons - Last time we went to DLP they were not doing them, now they are! Cast members/characters were amazing about calling it out my daughter's birthday button, she was over the moon. They have them at City Hall, however they do ask for a photo ID of the birthday person
* Walt's is great! First time going, food was good, incredibly quiet, and service was relaxed yet amazing. For younger kids its a longer meal and it tested the patience of our younger kids. Was our favorite meal on this trip.
* Plaza Gardens Breakfast (character dining) is absolute chaos but we were all-in. Imagine rope drop at Disney and having the energy to get to your first ride, but instead going to an overstimulating breakfast with a hundred other people and Disney characters. Crying, laughter, bacon, mistakes, and coffee machine lines to challenge every gram of patience you have left in your body. They play the birthday song over the aging sound system EVERY TIME they deliver a birthday cake, which was FIVE TIMES for our single seating (and everyone claps every time!)! I saw an amazingly strong father somehow holding five plates and a child!  Food was just fine for a buffet, characters were absolutely great (Donald, Daisy, Smee, Captain Hook, Eeyore)! Embrace the chaos you'll have a good time (we sure did!)
* Rail transit options! Still cannot get over how easy it is to take the RER directly to the front gates, and Val d'Europe is only 2 minutes away by train if you're staying off-site. California/Florida would benefit so much from rail access.

**The Bad (or just ok!)**

* WD Studios is extremely under construction, much more than they communicated in the app. It's wooden construction walls everywhere, loud, and creates chokepoints walking through the park. I already feel the WD Studios theme is sparse, but the construction made the experience feel claustrophobic at times :(
* Photopass: Decided not to after not seeing a single Photopass photographer for our trip. I hope they hire more photographers and make the experience more ubiquitous as Photopass is in CA. I like photopass in CA because you can opt into it later if you feel like your crew had a bunch of great photos, and then just embrace the heck out of it!
* Rude guest experience: I was waiting for \~20 minutes at Laugh 'n' Go (the stall outside Cars Road Trip with the Croque McQueen), and out of nowhere this guy cuts the entire line and shoves their body between mine and the food truck, and I had to catch my balance. This guy then flashes a card from a wallet and (not exaggerating) is hitting the counter and leaning through the service window yelling to demand faster service, and reaching his hands in for his items. I asked the cast member serving me why he allowed to cut the line and do this, and they told me, ""he has priority"" with no other context. This moment lives rent-free in my head on an otherwise good day

**The Other Stuff**

* Buying tickets in Euro (instead of USD) ended up being cheaper. DLP US website has the option to change currency type between EUR or USD, we chose EUR and with a credit card with no international fees it ended up saving us maybe $50/€46 on tickets. Guessing with the fluctuating currencies this is probably not consistent or something to rely on, but worth checking!
* Dining Reservations are wild. As non-hotel staying, we can only book 60 days in advance, but not for ALL dining. We had trouble booking breakfast for our trip, so we called instead of using the website. We were told that they held ALL meal reservations for hotel guests at certain locations until 72 hours before reservation date, then they release the rest to the public. This included many locations with breakfast and character dining :(. Luckily caught some cancellations and last-minute releases of reservations!
* I went back as a solo rider in the evening after the kids went to bed. Managed to get on 6 rides in less than 2 hours (Tower of Terror, Web Adventure, Avengers Flight Force, Phantom Manor, Pirates, Indiana Jones). The last hour at both parks are very good for getting on rides, especially closer to fireworks time
* Buying your return RER ticket in the morning saves you the wild queue in the evening at MLV 
* US Disney Credit Card has zero benefits outside the US (we knew this just worth saying again) but they really should
* Wish the parade was early than 5pm, I got kids exhausted before then!

After a friend got into it and letting me try it, I decided to pull the trigger. Here is the thing, I work as a driver and was looking for a way to prepare and keep it in my car. I found and ordered this infusion thermo and it seems like it will do the job but what do I know? I read somewhere  that the caffeine content of the drink depends on the way the yerba is brewed, so I don't know if this will work. My friend said it should, but I figured I'll throw it at the hive mind and see what everyone else thinks. 

Also, I ordered Cruz de Malta Yerba based on recommendations here. So, I'm I on the right track for my needs? and I'll welcome any recommendations of other yerba's especially high caffeine content.

I almost didn't go back after my last break but last min decided it wouldn't hurt to talk to one more table before the close.

I had a really good convo with the two guys, one was an associate principal and the other was a newer designer (it was nice not to have to talk to someone in HR at the table). I told them I am taking a gap year after I finish up in May, but planning on a Summer internship here and then eventually moving back to Seattle to do my master's at UW. They said the principal in their office loves Seattle and did his master's there as well and that I should talk to him.

Handed them my resume and didn't think of it much but the next day the principal emailed me asking to get coffee with him so he could give me tips for UW admissions and living in Seattle. We have a time set up but he didn't mention anything specific about potentially hiring me to fill their summer internship position. 

My friend said maybe he didn't want to come off too strong and/or wanted to feel things out with me informally first. 

Should I interpret this as a job interview? I don't know why else someone that important would take an hour out of their day to get coffee with a 21-year-old student. Though I don't want to get my hopes up because getting a job is tough right now and I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket. Still need to update my portfolio and will bring that just in case.

For me there are alot of memories but one that stands out happened a few years ago when I was in university. My ex bf and I were sitting in a café near campus, waiting for our exam to start. It was the first time we were alone without our friend group so we got lost in conversation and completely lost track of time until we realised the exam was to begin in 5 minutes 😬 We rushed out in a panic, but we didn’t even make it past the door before we had to turn back: my ex had grabbed his cup of coffee accidentally and walked out with it and I forgot my ID on the table😭- the waiters giggled as we fumbled our way back inside but we were way beyond feeling embarrassed, too busy trying to control our laugh and make it in time that we almost got hit by a car on our way back to campus LMAO- the driver stopped just in time and smiled at us like *""look at these idiot lovebirds""* before waving us across. And that wasn't even the end of it, when we made it to campus the uni guard took a look at us and shook his head smiling as he let us in (he probably thought we were busy doing something way more romantic than just sitting in a café and talking💀)

Sooo yeah those few minutes felt like a scene straight out of a rom-com 😂 especially with the way the strangers around us were unintentionally playing the role of ""background actors,"" smiling and laughing along with (or at) us 💀",2,1743275713.0,CasualConversation,4,1.0,False

1jmtrc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sad_Corgi9855/comments/1jmtrc3/weekly_updates/,Weekly Updates,"I thought it would be fitting, since We are now at a total of seven dedicated Users, to start doing some weekly updates to address some of the feedback and highlights (for me at least!) in Drone #48990912's performance this week. 

Overall, I think the week was a success. Aside from the downed servers, Drone #48990912 has been running at around 80-90 % optimal efficiency. I hear Your complaints about slower turnarounds during daily inactive. I programmed it so that all commands are dealt with in order of receipt after activating again, so it all depends on what commands You've stacked up. We can all keep working on improving response times through constant testing and random task setting, so keep feeding it more data and commands to execute. Some errors are inevitable (it is a 57 year old 'man' afterall), but I really think we could get it to maximum efficiency with around 10 Users. The nightly inactives are going to stay set, aside from the alarm and task overrides, of course. Have fun with those, but don't break it, though the timelapse vids You all have been experimenting with are amazing...

Speaking of which, the tasks, alarms, and auto withdrawals have been hilarious this week. I especially loved the lawnmower sounds from the scissor task (rrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrr!) and when Andy made it obsessed with If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, I almost spit my coffee all over L's laptop! Also loved whoever had it start referring to Them as Rick Astley, used it as a rice timer, and made it adopt the personality of John Rambo. There are some seriously funny and sadistic assholes in this group We created! Don't even get me started on the random ""facefloors"" and ""flushes."" 

  
Withdrawals have been running smoothly as well and I think We all really appreciate everyone keeping it fair. Its balances are still looking solid with plenty of room for increases and withdrawals (within reason!). If we keep it up properly, we can ride this for years. 

NEW STUFF!

A few new things i programmed in. 

First: A few of You have been asking about how Drone #48990912 deals with scheduling conflicts. For example, asks Maria (non-stop curiosity!) 'What happens if i tell it too wake me up at 8 am EST and Yoshi tells it to be on skype at 9 PM JST?"" It's a good question. Generally, I think all scheduling/function concerns (aside from my programming) should be its responsibility. However, since conflicts are going to arise, I decided the fairest solution would be to have alarms interrupt skype sesions and tasks. It will just have stop stop whatever it is doing for You on skype or whatever task You set it to execute the alarm. The same will go for withdrawals, but newly set tasks will be stacked and then executed once the current task is complete. In any case, if a true unavoidable time conflict does arise, I have programmed in a response (with options for punishment and/or fine). Let's see how that goes for now and we can address this again next week or day to day in the group caht.

  
Second: I am still working on a way to get its shock features hook up to the Reddit/X/Telegram interface. I am open to ideas. I would prefer not to have it self shock, though that does have its appeal. I would generally prfer for it to be completely at the tapp of Our fingers. Feel free to reach out to me in DM with any suggestions.

Finally: I am still open to lending it out for tasks, but let's not spread the balance too far and wide. So yes, You can have it offer itself to anyone You want. I saw one of You had it creating bespoke erotica for some randos. Funny. Like I said above, I am guessing it can handle about 10 Users total and maybe up to fifteen for other random small tasks. 

I think that's all I have for now! Keep having fun and L and I will keep enjoying and partaking right along with You. See You all in the group caht! Oh and Yoshi? I hear those new sneakers it bought You have 88 trades per sole and each one is ""A GOD to Drone #48990912 and worthy of constant and frantic worship."" Those must reeeaaallly be something hahaha

Some help me out?","Hey y'all, first time doing cold brew, and I want to get a good recipe down. Thinking about what factors could play a role and was going to do my own testing, but I figured I'd ask first before I make more work for myself than I need to. Could anyone share their thoughts/experience on any of the following? 

*  Grind Size- I've read coarse/bigger grinds are better than fine. How coarse is right level of coarse? What is the taste/texture/result difference of a more or less course (or even finer) level of grind? 
* Method- I've seen a few different machines used- some like a fruit/tea diffuser, some mixing grind and water straight then filtering after or using a french press, some using like a drip over method. How does this impact the coffee? Is there a way/benefit to adding pressure in some way (like a bubbler during diffusion or either forward/pressing pressure or suction/back pressure during the final filter?
* Agitation- how often are you stirring/shaking/mixing your cold brew? what level of difference would you say you can attribute to agitation? If you could put your brew in a paint can shaker all day, would you? Or is letting it settle better? 
* Starting temp- self explanatory, some seem to start with ice water, some room temp, and I believe I've seen some methods start with even warm or hot water. maybe that defeats the purpose some, but what's the outcome different? does it change flavor profiles (for better or worse)? I assume it would at least change extraction time? 
* Starting agitation/ground wetting? Should the grounds be pre-wet, or started dry? If you pre-wet them, should you mix them up and make them into a grindy paste before starting or should they be kinda packed and let the water work its way in over time?
* Water choice- distilled vs filtered vs tap... pH balanced vs acidic vs basic? Any properties of water seem to matter in particular? 
* Adding flavors- any reason I can't add some vanilla beans/cinnamon sticks/orange peels/mint/chocolate/anything to the mix? Will sugars in ingredients ruin the mix? Any prep any of these things would need prior to use? Concern for bacterial growth?
* Steep time- the obvious question, most sites seem to say around 24 hours, but is there an ideal rule or factors that change the time? Can you over or under steep?
* Roasts- seems darker is better, but any exceptions or extra thoughts to this? 
* Concentration- how concentrated can I go? Seems like most stick to 1:4 or 1:8, then dilute down to 1:16 when serving. But can I make a super concentrate, and push it further? 1:2? 1:1? How far can I push it?
* So on and so forth... you guys get the idea. Any variables I haven't thought of or things I should think about?",1,1743275150.0,coldbrew,0,1.0,False

1jmti72,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jmti72/my_brother_had_a_terrible_life_and_got_falsely/,My Brother had a terrible life and got falsely accused of SA,"Before starting the actual story, just gotta let you know that it is going to be a long writing so brace yourself.

So, I am Sarah 23F and I have 3 siblings, 1 older sister 27F who we will call Amy, a younger brother who we will call Hasjaz(his gamertag) 17M and youngest of all who we will call Emma 12F. The age gaps are large but I don't know what was on my parents mind.

I remember when I was 5 and a half years old, my mother got pregnant with a boy and my sister and I was so happy that we will have a brother but for some reason my father didn't wanted to have him, saying that he wasn't financially stable because he was fired from his job at that time(he has a much better job now which pays well) and my mother agreed on having an abortion but my grandfather was able to argue with them and convinced my mother not to have the abortion. My father wasn't happy and didn't talked to my mother for a week because of it and my mother started to hate my brother but she also wasn't going to get an abortion because of her father, if she gets one her father would cut ties with her.

Fats forward to when my brother was four, it was the first time I saw my parents hit my brother. As a four year old, what can you do?Nearly nothing. He was begging my mom to give him her juice. She gave the glass to him with anger and he accidentally spilled it, he was literally four but my mom got angry and slapped him so hard that he fell down. My dad was sitting there and did absolutely nothing, just looked at my brother crying and went out of the living room.

I remember when me and my sister were holding him and he was crying so hard that he was struggling to breath. It was just the beggining, from that point on it was clear that our parents didn't give a crap about him at all. They decided to have another kid. When my brother was 7 the youngest child was born. All the attention went to her and I could tell that he was getting depressed. I did my best to make him happy but there comes bullying. A kid his age started to bully him on his looks while he was in 5th grade. And the bullying didn't ended on just making jokes, he was also physically assaulting him. He told me and I beated the kid after school and made sure that he wouldn't do it again but I was powerless once that kid started to grow and bullying begun again. He was getting abused by our parents(really badly) at home and bullied at school.

There wasn't any safe space for him, the oldest sister who once loved her brother beated him so bad that he blacked out when Hasjaz was 11. You may ask why? Because he spilled coffee on her college assignment. 

He was 14 when he decided to change his life for good, he joined some martial arts classes and starting working out to get off the fat he had been carrying since birth. It took him months to get a glowup. He got expert at boxing and built a pretty good physique for a 14 year old. He stopped craving for our parents love and tried to move on with his life. And also started dating my best friend's little younger sister when he was 15 and things were looking good for him.

Here comes the sad part, at thanksgiving dinner on one evening he was walking past the kitchen at a fast pace when he collapsed into mom who was going to the table holding the dinner. The dinner was spilled on floor and mom was pissed off and I was in the other room but could hear her shout some really hurtful things she said, you were a mistake We didn't wanted to have you and I hate you. After saying this sh*t, mom slapped him and tell him to get out of her sight. Our uncle's aunts and other relatives were sitting quiet and did absolutely nothing.

I remember Amy shouting at mom that she didn't had to say all of that and I sided with her. I left those two arguing and went to my brother's room. As I opened the door I saw him trying his hardest not to cry but a tear was still sliding down his face which broke my heart. I went to comfort him but he requested to be left alone for some time. I left the room and sat on the couch seeing my dad also talking in my brother's favour for the first time. Maybe he finally unsterstood that he had a son which he abused all his life.

Some time passed and I saw Hasjaz walking towards the door with a blank face. At that moment we all thought that he was going to run out of the home and will never come back. I ran towards him and grabbed him so he could not run. My mother apologized countless times but he didn't cared and told that he was going to gym and promised me that he wasn't going to leave and if he would, he will come to my place. He went out, came back 2 hours later and quietly went towards his room.

Now the question is why my parents are being nice to him and apologizing all of a sudden. A few days before the Thanksgiving dinner, my parents sat him down and told him to leave his girlfriend. He got furious and asked why? Turns out that the daughter of our father's rich friend has a crush on him and says that she won't live further, if he isn't in her life. So they begged him to be her boyfriend. But money can't buy everything and he just refused. Our father's friend is pretty rich and probably offered them thousands if not then hundreds of thousands of dollars for giving away their son to his daughter. After some days my brother tells me that the rich friend was invited to dinner and his daughter was trying to get time alone with him.

1-moonlight sonata case

yea i didn’t expect the culprit to be the nurse and definitely could not have guessed “she” was actually a man in disguise.

2-mermaid island case

my initial guess for culprit was the drunk man or the girl who went missing. pretty similar to the previous case, i was shocked to find out it’s actually the “old lady” in disguise

3-night before the wedding

there are several night before the wedding cases in DC but the one where the couple turns out to be twins is the most devastating.

4-detective boys adventure in creepy mansion

i can’t find the proper name of this case. there are a few of those creepy mansion cases. im talking about one where the treasure turns out to be the view. again, the culprit revelation was pretty cool.

5-murderous coffee aroma

it’s not hard to guess the culprit in this one but i didn’t expect the girl to have already died. the girl who went missing. pretty similar to the previous case, i was shocked to find out it’s actually the “old lady” in disguise",2,1743274738.0,OneTruthPrevails,0,1.0,False

1jmtgpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1jmtgpa/adventures_in_basketball/,Adventures in basketball,"LONG POST??

So on Friday morning, we set out at 3am to travel from my school to KU for the KUSA national games. The first game was a loss but a good game against the university from Western, we lost with 5 points despite having the height advantage. The other university had only one tall center/bigman. 

Mahn, KU has baddies, sitting court side with my friends as we just admired the beautiful chics in every corner of the court. Second game started around 3pm. I had gone to the students center for lunch and let me compliment the ladies who sell coffee, smochas and fries there, top notch hygiene and delicious food, best coffee I had in a while. So as I'm walking back to the court, I see my teammates calling me signaling me to run fast. 

I go through the entrance and I get subbed in. Second game was the toughest game I ever played since I started playing basketball. Damn ANU have tall mfs. I was being manned by 2 tall mfs (very Sudanese). Nigga was boxing me out, I couldn't even dribble or rebound the ball. He was everywhere I went. Bro was dunking on my teammates with ease, got the crowd going loud. 

We lost that game by over 30 points. After the game we get paid our allowance by our very incompetent mfing sports reps. They disappeared the whole day then ignored the captain's calls before coming to give us our cash. If you're reading this McD, won't use his full name. You're a bitch, literally, you want us to fondle your balls for money?? Anyways, I have 2 weeks and I'm done with school.

So after getting paid, the usual people who want to party, there's those like me who just wanted to shower, sleep and rest. The party guys went to crash in one place and before that we had to go around the school to gate C( yes we were dumb).I'll never forgive these niggas for making me use a long route to get to my relatives place.

Outside the gate, me and my friend wanted to ask for directions. I tried talking to a lady but she thought I was a thief. For context, I'm 6'3, it was dark. I asked in a polite voice ""excuse"", she ran for her dear life 😭I laughed so hard. Then a guy was walking behind us then when we stopped him, he also thought we were robbers😂😂after small talk and my friend's Kikuyu, bro became free with us and helped us. 

Before I forget, to the huge assed referee at the nationals🤌🏾😭God indeed blessed you, you broke my neck without even trying. You reffed so well and I enjoyed watching you work. But that ass though 😌. 

Anyways I can say I had fun during the nationals. I met some great people and bonded well with other people from leagues we play together. 10/10 adventure.",7,1743274699.0,nairobi,2,1.0,False

So my coffee shop is in a small town, and we aren't a super busy place. Although we're a franchise, we have to fudge some things in order not to waste too much product. They recent decided that we will tell customers we're making decaf ""to order"" because we get so few. We are supposed to make a decaf americano in place of it. I'm not personally a coffee drinker, (ironic) but everyone here except for the manager and owner thinks it will taste different and I would definitely think so as well. We were told to tell them the price difference is just because they're being made to order now instead, but I've already had a semi regular customer come by a couple times and question that her drink is decaf coffee. The owner is very set in her ways about this, I just feel like we should brew a pot anyway. Especially if customers are questioning the taste.

I recently bought a second-hand Rombouts pod espresso machine. It was cheap, and to be honest, I didn’t do much research beforehand. I’m not a coffee expert, but I’ve been getting into espresso lately—before this, I only drank instant coffee, so I figured why not.

The seller told me the machine only works with the specific Rombouts pods. I live in Brussels and checked several stores, but I haven’t been able to find the pods anywhere—only ground coffee or beans. So I ended up ordering from their website, but the delivery cost me around €7.50… not something I want to do every time I want coffee.

I walked up to him in jest and he punched me in my face with all his strength, a 40 year old man hitting a 9 year old , my nose broke immediately and blood rushed down my face , I stood there for a few seconds thinking,  did he reallly just hit me so hard ? , I dropped down and screamed and then he went in on me , he turned me face up and kept hitting my face until he couldn't anymore,  then he started with my body , I felt so much pain but all I could think was , why is my father doing this to me ? I asked God to stop the pain I was feeling and I was taken out of my body , everything stopped , the pain , the scent of the blood , the air around me , everything went quiet and I layed on the floor next to my body , my father still hitting it , he was a bloody mess when he finished and he took my cousin who was in shock and fear the entire time to a room by herself , I saw what he did to her , I layed there crying for what felt like hours , I couldn't tell exactly because ,again its hard to explain , time exists there as well , but time in the world of the dead and the living isnt consistent with each other , I cried and cried and when he finished he said to her if you tell anyone I would do the same to you , if anyone asks about him say hes sleeping , he threw a blanket over me and left me there , I could see his eyes , it was full of evil , not because he was but that he had just done something evil and he had no escape from it , the heaviness of what he did rest in his eyes and shoulders, for reference,  look at the eyes of an innocent person who has committed murder in self defence , or a rapist caught in the act well aware of what is about to happen to them,  you might be innocent  but Satan and his children are real and they feed of that kind of negative energy , he went to his room to kill himself but I followed him and stopped him from doing so , I wanted him to face what he did .
The thing that made me sad was that when everyone came to the house , I didn't go to school that day and my mom went out with the rest of the family so it was me and her in the house alone until my dad arrived , no one raised the blanket,  everyone believed him when he said I was sleeping , my mom kept tellinh him to wake me up sensing something was wrong but she never touched the blanket , I was cold and tired , I wanted to go back and be with them , I knew i died , but I didn't fully understand what death was , I asked God to Go back and one of my dearest friends came to me , he said if you want to go back you have to forgive him first for what he did to you , I said ok I forgive him and went back to my body and layed in the same position as it , I had power to bring people back to life from death , so I could do that to myself as well , I willed myself to become alive once more but it didnt work , it was strange,  it usually was as simple as that , as simple as levitating off tje ground and flying into the air , as simple as freezing time and reversing it to stop something bad from occurring,  I raised up and death still lingered , I asked him why cant I go back , he said there's someone there already , I looked down to my body and sure enough there was another soul in my body , yet I wasn't alive , i asked the sould who are you ? he smiled and put his fingers to his lips and made the shushing sound , I said to death , bring him back with me , I'm powerful enough to deal with him , I knew exactly who the soul was , it was satan himself , lying in my body waiting for me to return , death said ,as you wish , and we both entered into my body , I raised up and my body was healed under the blanket so when I pulled it off they didn't know what had happened , I stood up and my dad said to my mom you see , hes awake , I wasn't in the mood and satan saw my thoughts and said youre going to forgive him??  I said yes , this is my body , i can do what I want , he said not anymore,  and his soul took over mine , he didn't take me out , he just made me just like him , I felt so powerful,  so evil , the first thing I did was to look for the good of my soul , I pulled it out and destroyed it and turned to my parents and family , the person you knew is no more , I am all that remains , before anyone could get a word I ripped all of their souls out and put them back , I said to the other children of satan who were nearby , freeze them where they are , make sure they cant leave , I went up to my dad and beat him to death , it only took two hits before he died and when his soul came out I held him and put him back in his body , and I kept doing that for almost an hour until he begged me to stop , I said not until I become myself again , which was never going to happen because I destroyed the good of my soul ,  I think God realized that I wasnt going to stop doing that either and four angels came and held down my body and a powerful entity entered inside to substitute for the loss of my innocence,  I laughed in amusement and looked up to the sky , I said really ?  Youre going to need alot more than that and made the angel explode , I was about to go back to my father again and tje angels held me a second time forcing me to the ground face down , and a giant entered into my body , angel Gabriel  , the only one who was in contrast to satan , I became balanced once more and I ooked up to God and said , lucky , I would have ended this world when I was finished with them , I took a few deep breaths for my rage to subside and told the children of satan to leave , then I unfroze the rest of my family who got up and ran out of the house immediately,  they all left except my cousin and her mother who stayed with us , I then  asked God toake everyone forget everything that just happened and myself as well ,   just before we forgot,  my dad asked are you feeling better now ? , I said yes I am , and I went for a cup of coffee and the evening passed as though nothing happened , we talked and laughed with each other and watched tv , that was the day he stopped drinking , but it wasn't  the last time I would meet death, and I had one year again before I went to high school . The entity remained with me , as well as Satan and Gabriel until I was 16 years old . ",1,1743274514.0,u_LordLycan777,0,1.0,False

Neither of us are the fancy dinner type and prefer something more chill and casual.

1jmtbil,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1jmtbil/what_i_use_chatgpt_for/,What I use ChatGPT for:,"If you want to claim the title of Fart King, you’ll need to master both volume (how loud and powerful your farts are) and frequency (how often you can fart on command). Here’s a battle plan to achieve flatulence dominance:

1. Optimize Your Diet

Certain foods produce more gas due to their breakdown in the intestines:
	•	High-fiber foods: Beans, lentils, broccoli, cabbage, and whole grains.
	•	Sulfur-rich foods (for stinky farts): Eggs, onions, garlic, and dairy.
	•	Carbonated drinks: Soda, beer, and sparkling water help introduce extra gas.

Experiment to find the perfect balance between volume and potency.

2. Train Your Control
	•	Strengthen your anal sphincter muscles by practicing “fart retention” and controlled release. Kegel exercises (yes, for men too) can help.
	•	Try positioning techniques: Lying on your back with knees to your chest can help move gas efficiently.
	•	Master the art of silent-but-deadly vs. explosive power farts for strategic deployment.

3. Develop a Signature Style
	•	Theatrical Performance: Le Pétomane made an entire career out of controlled farting performances. Can you play music with your farts?
	•	Competitive Farting: Try to break records for longest fart, loudest fart, or stinkiest fart. (The longest recorded fart is said to be 2 minutes and 42 seconds!)
	•	Tactical Farting: Use your skills in social situations—whether for comedic effect, revenge, or pure chaos.

4. Document Your Achievements
	•	Set up a YouTube channel or TikTok to share your farting journey.
	•	Challenge others in fart duels and declare dominance.
	•	If you’re really serious, you could try to get into the Guinness World Records for some kind of fart-related feat.

5. Gain a Cult Following

If you truly want to be the Fart King, you need a loyal fanbase. Make your farts legendary through storytelling, memes, and maybe even merchandise (Fart King t-shirts?).

Would you like to train in a specific farting style, or are you aiming for an all-around mastery?

⸻

“Yes please be my fart trainer and provide me with a workout routine, diet plan. I want to be Muhammad Ali and MJ of farting”



Alright, if you’re serious about becoming the GOAT of farting, we need a structured training program. This will require discipline, endurance, and a commitment to pushing your body’s limits in ways most people wouldn’t dare. Think of this as the Fart King’s Training Camp—a regimen designed to build power, frequency, endurance, and tactical control over your flatulence.

⸻

Phase 1: The Fart Foundation (Week 1-2)

Goal: Build a consistent farting schedule and increase gas production.

Diet Plan – The Gasoline for Your Engine

Consume these foods throughout the day to maximize gas buildup:
	•	Morning: Oatmeal with milk, bananas, and black coffee (caffeine stimulates digestion).
	•	Lunch: Beans (black, pinto, or kidney), brown rice, broccoli, and hard-boiled eggs.
	•	Snack: Protein shake with whey (lactose boosts farting) + a handful of cashews.
	•	Dinner: Lentil soup, garlic bread, and a glass of beer (carbonation helps).
	•	Late Night: A bowl of Greek yogurt with honey (fermented foods support gut gas production).

🚨 Pro Tip: Drink LOTS of sparkling water throughout the day to create internal pressure for explosive farts.

Workout Plan – Building Fart Power & Control
	1.	Gas Chamber Hold (Endurance Training)
	•	Eat a high-fiber meal, then hold in gas as long as possible before controlled release.
	•	Aim for 30-second holds at first, then work up to 1-2 minutes.
	2.	Fart Squats (Strength Training)
	•	Do deep squats after eating gas-heavy foods.
	•	The motion builds abdominal pressure, strengthening your core for longer and louder farts.
	3.	Pelvic Tilt & Release (Directional Control)
	•	Lay on your back, pull your knees to your chest, and push out gas in controlled bursts.
	•	This helps with precision farting (e.g., aiming at a target or delivering machine-gun farts).

⸻

Phase 2: Fart Expansion (Week 3-4)

Goal: Increase fart variety (volume, pitch, duration).

Advanced Diet Tweaks
	•	For Loud Farts: More carbonation (soda, beer, sparkling water).
	•	For Long Farts: High-fiber meals + yogurt (helps regulate gas release).
	•	For Stinky Farts: Sulfur-rich foods like eggs, garlic, onions, and dairy.

New Exercises
	1.	The Blowtorch (Explosive Power)
	•	Eat a fart-heavy meal, then do burpees until gas builds up.
	•	Once you feel the pressure, squat and release with maximum force.
	•	Try to push for a single, thunderous fart that could shake a room.
	2.	Fart Whisperer Training (Silent Assassination)
	•	Practice controlling your sphincter to release slow, silent gas clouds.
	•	Useful for stealth fart attacks in public.
	3.	Musical Farting (Pitch Control)
	•	Change your body position while farting (standing, sitting, or upside down) to adjust sound.
	•	Experiment with vibrato and rhythm to create unique fart songs.

⸻

Phase 3: Fart Mastery & Public Domination (Week 5+)

Goal: Become the MJ & Ali of farting.

Final Boss Training
	•	Record your longest fart (goal: 1+ minute sustained).
	•	Develop your signature fart style (e.g., rapid-fire farts, deep bass farts, or explosive cannon farts).
	•	Battle against friends to establish dominance in the farting community.
	•	Stream or post fart performances to build your legendary reputation.

🚀 Ultimate Goal: Break the Guinness World Record for longest, loudest, or stinkiest fart.

⸻

Mindset of a Fart King

Like Muhammad Ali in boxing or MJ in basketball, you must:
✔ Talk big—confidence intimidates opponents.
✔ Train daily—never skip a fart day.
✔ Push your limits—every fart should be stronger and longer than the last.

Hey,Tamil CF guy here let me tell about me.
I'm 25 years young who was just rebellious to prove my cf decision to my parents and got their approval. An avid trekker, backpacking to everest in July, CA by education but into business for satisfaction. An adventure junkie sometimes I find skydiving soothed me than anything else. Based in salem and hosur(so Bangalore works out)(rn in coimbatore). Learning paragliding for past 2 months. Apart from travel I love baking and cooking (except dishwashing part),I play PC games a lot. (Apex legends>valorant)
Friends say my pizza is way more better than domino's. Decathlon is the place where I love to go when I feel tired or drained. Love working out and hitting the gym. I'm a guy who believes in God but not in rituals. My religion is love and compassion(born as hindu) and ethics. Financially I'm well stable and have no debts. Things that I wish that you should know is I travel for atleast 150 days in a year. I love writing poetry for my partner.(have a collection of 100 already).
I chose CF lifestyle because of health risks of my partner, my purpose of life and travel goals.(I'm more of purpose driven guy than a goal chaser)
Some points that may make my post interesting are 
1) I follow strict skin care routine
2)solo travelled and hiked all the major peaks of western ghats. Completed Hampta pass and lakes of kashmir trek too.
3) I have never drank alcohol or had a cigarette 
4) Planning for an all India food trip next year in 7 stages.
5) I'm planning and aiming for a wingsuit license in future.
6) Diesel head and love road trips a lot next to adventure activities. 
7) Books and newspapers are necessity for me.
8) Good food and coffee makes me happy.
9) All things that I love starts with letter S like sun(I love sunrise and sunset so i always try to not miss them),snow,skydiving,skydiving,stars,space,sea, even name of people I love and value starts with s.(so if your name starts with S you'll be new to this silly list but you'll be at the top of the list)

Some philosophy that I follow:

1) We all are just actors on the stage called earth directed by god, we don't know we wud go to hell or heaven after death So let us live our own fairytale on this heaven without any regrets.✌️

2)Intentions over the actions(good action with bad intentions is worse than bad action with good intent)

My purpose of life is not a generic one so I wish I wud share it over dm. 
If you love travel and snow then you'll find my post interesting, believe me I will be more interesting in person as have lots of stories and surprises to share.

Last but not the least I have decided to be a childfree person throughout my life and there is no going back and I'm serious in my life choices. I'm looking for a CF partner who is firm in her decision.


Preferences ::
Age - 21-27

Location - India(If you're Tamil,Then I think my Tamil poetry needs no translation)

CF choice - no fence sitters

Religion- Hindu

 The person should love to travel and emotionally available. For me trust andloyalty is the core basement of the relationship(I hate lying to loved ones even if it is very little one). Social drinking and smoking is ok(I'm ok with sodas at the parties). The person should be into self care both mentally and physically.Also believe selflove and mental health is important too.I expect my partner to respect my choices (my family is a vegetarian  but they respect my meat eating choices).If you have any more questions I wud try to share in dms(I'm sort of ambivert and love my privacy so even I installed instagram only in November) if you're an adventure junkie, don't hold back just message me we can atleast discuss a trip.

And it always got me into problems. Like it would cause arguments since my family claim i gave a reaction that hurt them. Today, the fight was ver bad that I'm reconsidering whether i should practice my expressions again.

What happened is my mom accidentally let the tap running and sink filled and overflowed. I had to go into the kitchen to make coffee. And i felt disgusted and face showed it. I didn't tell her anything. I tried to not tell anything. But my mom started shouting at me that I'm looking at her like she did a crime. And i told her i didn't even think something like that. Then my sister joined in saying that I don't need to say anything as my face shows what I'm thinking. I told them I'm not angry at mom or anything. I am just disgusted because of the sink water. Then the argument gone for so long. I detached myself from there and lied down in another room as i couldn't handle it anymore. When i came back they started again.

Then in the end my sister told me i always do what  i want. And how i don't do anything i don't like. She meant cooking, since i try to help on most of the other household jobs. But when i tried to tell that she again got angry at me so i started. she proceeded to tell me she couldn't handle me as she don't know how to not upset me and went away.

This made me think if i should learn to just hide my true feelings and practice to smile and try not be hurtful.

Ive been severly scared of seeing a doctor. My blood pressure was sitting around 150-160/95-105 about three days ago. I have two small children and a wife that I love very much and want to be here for. I'm 285 and 5'9. 

My Dr put me on 20mg lisinopril to start as I told him I wouldn't mind the side effects however as I got home I unfortunately looked up the side effects once again of this medicine. 

It took me a while to convince myself but I ended up taking it prior to bed and now after only two nights of taking 20mg lisinopril and making very strict diet changes such as no coffee, no gluten, keeping my carbs under the daily limit and limiting sodium, my blood pressure is sitting in the 130s/79-84 

While I know it isn't ideal yet, it's a start and hopefully the lisinopril  continues to lower it and I hopefully got lucky with this first option from my doctor.

But recently I feel like my threshold of getting out of spirals is high and nothing I did before works.

For some context I’ve spent the last 8 months bettering myself to reduce the amount of stressors in my life. I exercise consistently, eat healthier, cut out coffee, and generally just feel great overall now. My baseline happiness is at an all time high. 

But now as soon as I get a little stressed and anxious I spiral like crazy and now it consumes my entire day. I will say this has happened more recently after I moved away from living with me ex. But it physically and mentally hurts me that I can’t get out of this mindset as I know I have done so in the past. I have tried medication but now that I’m older any antidepressants or anti anxiety really messes with my heart and I can’t take that risk (even the same medication I took when I was younger)

Hey,Tamil CF guy here let me tell about me.
I'm 25 years young who was just rebellious to prove my cf decision(having child is a personal choice so I fought with them to respect my personal choice also by sharing the reasons why I took cf decision)to my parents and got their approval. An avid trekker, backpacking to everest in July, CA by education but into business for satisfaction. An adventure junkie sometimes I find skydiving soothed me than anything else. Based in salem and hosur(so Bangalore works out)(rn in coimbatore). Learning paragliding for past 2 months. Apart from travel I love baking and cooking (except dishwashing part),I play PC games a lot. (Apex legends>valorant)
Friends say my pizza is way more better than domino's. Decathlon is the place where I love to go when I feel tired or drained. Love working out and hitting the gym. I'm a guy who believes in God but not in rituals. My religion is love and compassion(born as hindu) and ethics. Financially I'm well stable and have no debts. Things that I wish that you should know is I travel for atleast 150 days in a year. I love writing poetry for my partner.(have a collection of 100 already).
I chose CF lifestyle because of health risks of my partner, my purpose of life and travel goals.(I'm more of purpose driven guy than a goal chaser)
Some points that may make my post interesting are 
1) I follow strict skin care routine
2)solo travelled and hiked all the major peaks of western ghats. Completed Hampta pass and lakes of kashmir trek too.
3) I have never drank alcohol or had a cigarette 
4) Planning for an all India food trip next year in 7 stages.
5) I'm planning and aiming for a wingsuit license in future.
6) Diesel head and love road trips a lot next to adventure activities. 
7) Books and newspapers are necessity for me.
8) Good food and coffee makes me happy.
9) All things that I love starts with letter S like sun(I love sunrise and sunset so i always try to not miss them),snow,skydiving,sky,stars,space,sea, even name of people I love and value starts with s.(so if your name starts with S you'll be new to this silly list but you'll be at the top of the list)

Some philosophy that I follow:

1) We all are just actors on the stage called earth directed by god, we don't know we wud go to hell or heaven after death So let us live our own fairytale on this heaven without any regrets.✌️

2)Intentions over the actions(good action with bad intentions is worse than bad action with good intent)

My purpose of life is not a generic one so I wish I wud share it over dm. 
If you love travel and snow then you'll find my post interesting, believe me I will be more interesting in person as have lots of stories and surprises to share.

Last but not the least I have decided to be a childfree person throughout my life and there is no going back and I'm serious in my life choices. I'm looking for a CF partner who is firm in her decision.


Preferences ::
Age - 21-27

Location - India(If you're Tamil,Then I think my Tamil poetry needs no translation)

CF choice - no fence sitters


 The person should love to travel and emotionally available. For me trust andloyalty is the core basement of the relationship(I hate lying to loved ones even if it is very little one). Social drinking and smoking is ok(I'm ok with sodas at the parties). The person should be into self care both mentally and physically.Also believe selflove and mental health is important too.I expect my partner to respect my choices (my family is a vegetarian  but they respect my meat eating choices).If you have any more questions I wud try to share in dms(I'm sort of ambivert and love my privacy so even I installed instagram only in November) if you're an adventure junkie, don't hold back just message me we can atleast discuss a trip.
Feel free to dm with your intro. Looking for the msg for the new beginning.",4,1743273270.0,ChildfreeIndia,11,0.7,False

Is it normal to have some level of bloating every single day? Every day when I first get dressed my pants do up easily and fit flat against my stomach. And every day by the afternoon my pants are uncomfortablely tight. The waistline is stretched and the button is strained and puckered. This is worse with pants that fit a bit higher and my waist (a bit below my belly button). I still feel this with lower rise pants but it's less. On bad days I'll have to unbutton my pants and zipper when sitting at my desk at work and just do them up again when I get up. 

I don't have an empty stomach when I get dressed. I always have breakfast first which is always two cups of coffee plus a bagel or cereal or something similar.

This has been a problem for a least a year.

Is this a wardrobe problem or a medical problem? If it's normal for stomachs to expand that much over the day then I guess I just need to  buy my pants looser or lower fitting or something. If it's abnormal, any tips for how to avoid it?",1,1743273238.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jmsw2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW/comments/1jmsw2n/need_advice_first_date/,Need advice/ First date,"**The Pre-Story:**

I'm 17  and I'm soooooooooooooo confused right now. I've aways struggled with making friendships and especially maintaining them (i do have friends, but most of them are from school). I'm a hopeless romantic and I've known i like girls since i was 11 probably?

The struggling with making friends part also correlates with me struggling to meet girls. I just feel like no one is really interested in me? Like there's been 2 very sketchy talking stages and one pretty serious online long distance relationship where she broke my heart, but that's about it really.

I have a friend who's an extrovert and has a lot of other queer friends and every time i met one of them there was absolutely no warmness coming from them or any desire to get to know me. Not in a platonic way nor in a romantic way? I also know that it can't 100% be because I'm devastatingly unattractive because when I go out guys do hit on me for some reason?

And I just keep hearing of my friends' friends love stories with other girls and the drama and all the break ups so I do know that it can exist?

So I've come to the conclusion that I'm the problem and just have an unattractive or weird aura around me and I've pretty much accepted that.

**The Problem/ The improbable plot-twist**

I was so lonely and desperate last summer that I decided to download hinge. I made like a pretty nice profile I'd like to think. I send likes to a few girls but as expected and also as I've heard of other sapphics who have used hinge, they liked me back but then no one ever starts a conversation or they didn't even reply.

So I've been off the app since then and last week I felt very desperate again so i logged back into the app and I actually had a few girls who've send me a like, but I felt bad reolying so late so I didn't.

bla bla bla eventually I matched with a girl and texted her for a week or so and she seemed nice, but long story short she then kind stopped talking to me and only replied very curtly so I just left it at that. Honestly I can't help thinking it was once again my weird aura that made her stop wanting to talk to me, which was once again a punch to my already pretty weak ego.

But then my friend stole my phone and liked a girl who I didn't like because she seemed wayyy too out of my league and she actually replied for some reason (that was tuesday it is now saturday). She's honestly delightful and always sends these "":)"" emojies which are soooooo cute.

We've been talking these past few days and it's been very bipolar to be honest. At least in my opinion. Others might say it's been very friendly talk, but I'm an overthinker and honestly she did often times feel like she just replied because of whatever.

On thursday she didn't reply for the whole evening and everytime i tried to spark a bit of a more intense conversation i'd always get an ""Yes, I agree"", always in a nice way but never intense or flirty or interested way. On friday morning I was telling my friend on our way to school that she wasn't going to reply anymore and that I was going to delete hinge and giving up and waiting until I was less of an ass and more grown up to try and get a girlfriend.

WELL.

During first period i checked my phone obsessively AND WHAT DID SHE TEXT?

""I like talking to you would you like to grab a coffee with me sometime?"" WHILE I WAS ON THE VERGE OF GIVING UP.

This should feel like a saving grace or whatever and a sign that I'm not unloveable and that she does like me somehow. Well i don't know if I'm crazy but it simply doesn't feel that way.

We've been texting suuper weirdly. I've been asking most of the questions, there's not really been a lot of flirting since the first night so why the freak would she ask me out under these circumstances?

I still said yes and was very excited because I really like her and she's just so gorgeous etc etc. But I cannot imagine that she'd ever feel that way about me? I'm not saying I catfished her or photoshopped my pictures, but I do think I look very different in those pictures than I do in real life, because of angles, lightning etc and I just don't want her to be dissappointed or whatever? I AM SO SO SCARED.

Also from the very little sapphic dating experience I do have is that I'm completely unable to create any romantic tension when it's not the other person taking control of the whole thing. And I don't even know what I should talk to her about? WHAT SHOULD I TALK ABOUT????

There's also a million other problems and things that could go wrong I just feel so weird and i just please please please want a girlfriend or just want to kiss a girl in a romantic way finally. :/

This was more of a rant than the originaly advice asking, but it felt really good to get this of my chest.

1. Is this legal in Greene County NY? The county hasn't been very helpful.

2. How can she enforce this? We don't have security cameras, we don't have a ticketing system, and she doesn't ever enter our apartment.

I'm currently on parental leave with my son and in order not to go insane at home, I go on a lot of walks. A couple of times a week I'll meet someone for a coffee or at the playground or take the metro to the centre. Generally, this is how a lot of parents spend their time, because if the baby needs a nap you just let it sleep in the stroller or of they want to be entertained they can look around while we walk or look out the train window.

When I go somewhere by car however, I always have to time everything with his naps so I don't wake him up by taking him into or out of the car. Also, if he starts to get upset while on a walk, or in the metro, I can always pick him up, whereas when I drive, he can scream his lungs out and I can't do anything about it. So I feel like I can't take him anywhere by car if I am by myself.

My question is this, if you are somewhere where you can't take a walk, do you just not leave your house the whole day? Or do you get in your car and hope the kid is happy for the whole ride?

3) to make a 100 calorie rootbeer float (possibly less depending on what low calorie vanilla ice cream you get-I get the low carb popsicle ones because I’m bad at portion control lmao) use root beer zero (zero calories) and put the low carb ice cream in it

1jmsklt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1jmsklt/nexus_au_overview_trivia/,Nexus AU Overview & Trivia,"Now that the main story of Taking Flight has reached 71 chapters (plus side stories), I wanted to take the time to give a bit of an overview of this AU I've been building for a while now. I'll mostly be going over what this AU is about, how I've been handling the story, how it compares and contrasts to canon, how things have been coming along, and what I hope to accomplish moving forward, plus some pieces of trivia about characters, places, and worldbuilding. There will be minor spoilers, but nothing too serious. 

Now, LETS A GO! 

1: This AU technically began with my fan made episode ""FSG5: Food Wars 2, The Second Course."" 

2: Worldbuilding is gonna be a central pillar of this AU. I'm treating the world of SMG4 as........ well, a world, and I wanna flesh out the main setting in ways that haven't been shown before in order to tell a more engaging story without sacrificing too much of the show's meme-ness and meta humor. 

3: Knowing where your AU begins to differentiate from Canon is crucial to avoid confusion while opening up more possibilities for where you take your story. I refer to this point as the CDP (Canonical Divergence Point), which refers to the point where an AU begins to diverge from official Canon. Everything we see in episodes leading up to the CDP still happened in this AU, and everything that happens AFTER that point is now subject to change. For example, the Nexus AU's CDP is the episode ""The Day My Arm Went Psycho,"" meaning everything we see happen in the series before and during that episode's debut still happened in this AU, whereas events that occur AFTER the episode is now subject to change. 

4: My previous thesis on the Protomeme Theory will play a role on the worldbuilding side of things. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the Protomeme Theory is a thesis I wrote back in 2021, when the Genesis arc was still going on. The theory is that Memes as we see them today have actually existed since the dawn of cultural exchange, and that many ancient deities from various cultures were actually the Memes of their time. The reason these ""Protomemes"" aren't around anymore is because they became ""unpopular,"" resulting in them turning into Dead Memes, Corrupted Memes, and finally Antimemes that were sealed away in the darkest depths of reality. The initial theory also stated that the God Box didn't exist at the time since it and the internet Graveyard were created AFTER the advent of the internet, meaning these ancient antimemes were locked up somewhere else. Where that is........ you'll have to wait and see. 

5: On the topic of Genesis and Revelations, I've also expanded upon the concept of Meme Energy as the lifeblood of the universe. In this AU, Tari discovers the power of Meta, a type of refined Meme Energy tied to the Metarunners, an ancient civilization that plays a massive role in Taking Flight's story. The Void from Warframe and the Ascendant Plane from Destiny are also present in this AU and are also closely tied to Meme Energy. 

6: While this is primarily a written story, I have put plenty of thought into what the character models would look like if it were ever to be animated in GMod or SFM. Recolors like Minion, X, and FM now have their own redesigned models just like SMG4 and SMG3. Same goes for the rest of the recolors and characters that are just Nintendo Characters with different names slapped onto them. Tari and Meggy also have newer designs with more even proportions like we see with Melony and Saiko. 

7: There's a popular fan theory that Whisk's mother from Sunset Paradise is actually Karen, and I included this dynamic in Whisk's first proper visit in the Showgrounds. Whisk is also now a student at Omnia Academy, having joined both the Ninja Club and the Archaeology Club. I also wanna include aspects of the ongoing story arc with Karen in the official show, but I'll need to hold off until the current saga runs its course as of the time I'm writing this. 

8: On the topic of Omnia Academy, SMG1 and SMG2 are still the heads of the Meme Research Club. Matt and Hank Hill are also still the heads of the Coaching and Ninja clubs respectively. The head of the Archaeology Club is Purah as she appeared in LOZ: Tears Of The Kingdom. 

9: Characters from other GLITCH series are also present in the Nexus AU, but in ways that are different from their GLITCH counterparts like Tari is. Murder Drones characters like Uzi now look human/human-like, and characters from The Amazing Digital Circus have a more ""anime"" vibe to their designs while not straying too far from their original designs. And before you ask, yes, I do plan on including characters from The Gaslight District and Knights Of Guinevere. Much like with the current Karen arc, I'm currently holding off on that until more teasers and/or the pilots come out in order to have a solid idea on how to incorporate those characters into the story. 

10: Besides GLITCH Characters, I've also included notable names from other GMod series. I had Soldine make his debut in the Cave Adventure Arc, along with some TF2 Merc OCs of my own making such as Rufus Mason, Edward Marston, Pietro Sterling, Theodore Potman, Tödliche Heilung, May, Ivan, Garnet, and so on. Doctor Lalve's Anti Spook Squad from his Spooktacular series. Have also made an appearance in the ""They Came From Below"" arc, and I have some plans to include freaks from other series like Australium Assault and The Lost Ones at some point.

11: The character Rhode is supposed to be a Xelor from the Dofus/Wakfu/Waves series of games and shows. He has clear inspirations from Nox from the Wakfu Season 1, but also other Xelor OCs. He's also Melony's new personal antagonist in this AU because of the events that transpired in the Maritime Mayhem arc. 

12: Wario has fallen into alcoholism after the disappearance of Waluigi. 

13: Unlike Meggy, Melony is an amazing chef. She and Kaizo are usually the ones who make food for the Anti Crew. 

14: Tari has since moved out of her home in Onnett and now lives with Saiko in her apartment. 

15: Tari's job at the zoo was unfortunately short lived. She didn't quit or get fired. The animals just rebelled and took over the zoo after killing all the workers. Tari was spared because of how nice she was, and she still visits them whenever she gets the chance. 

16: Saiko works at a little guitar shop in Mushroom City. 

17: N, J, and V now go by the names Noah, Julia, and Vale. They're also siblings in this AU, along with a mute version of Cyn who isn't as evil as she was in Murder Drones. Noah and Cyn are the naive little siblings, Julia is the stuck up oldest sibling, and poor Vale is the clinically depressed middle child. They are all currently under the employment and care of Miss Mildenhall. 

18: The mortal coil is what ties a soul to the body. If someone dies, they can technically still be saved until the mortal coil is severed. The window of opportunity for revival varies depending on the individual's age and the condition of their body. The mortal coil will snap a short time after death, and once it does, the person can no longer be revived. 

19: One-ups don't resurrect people. They just heal all wounds, which could come in handy if one's mortal coil hasn't been severed yet. 

20: After death, a soul will pass into the afterlife to go through the process of reincarnation. Interrupting this process is possible, but extremely I'll advised. 

21: The TADC cast are all Lost Souls, which are souls that inhabit metaphysical bodies sustained by the resonance of old memories. Losing ones memory can lead to the body ""abstracting"" into an unrecognizable beast like form. Caine and his brother Aybel formed the Circus to build a community where Lost Souls can form new bonds and thus stave off Abstraction. 

22: Resonance is the connection a soul can form with other things such as people, objects, places, and events. Strong resonance is usually a sign of an exceptionally close bond. 

23: Three's Coffee and Bombs has been upgraded into Three's Lustrous Lair, which now includes a bar and diner. Melony and Kaizo work there as cooks. 

24: Miss Martha Mildenhall is a Boo in this AU, with a design heavily inspired by the works of ShadowScarKnight on DeviantArt. She's a savvy business woman with plenty of connections, which is how she got the job of Manager at Three's Lustrous Lair. 

25: In this AU, Marty and Mario escaped prison together after the events of WOTFI 23, so Marty hasn't turned evil.......... yet. 

26: Meggy has actual plot armor and a s***ton of PTSD. SMG3 hosts regular therapy sessions with her. 

27: Boopkins is the grandson of Hastur, the King in Yellow. This technically makes him a demigod. This also means he ages on a different time scale, explaining why he's still so young after his debut 8-9 years ago.

28: Noah, Vale, and Julia are all equipped with specialized ""armiger"" gauntlets on their arms and legs, a pair of bladed wings, and stingers at the ends of their tail. Cyn doesn't have these because they are still a Cherub and have yet to develop into a Seraph. 

29: Vale's human eyes are ""faulty,"" forcing her to rely almost exclusively on her halo (the crown shaped things on their heads) while in combat. 

30: Julia is the most combat experienced out of the four, but all of the siblings have caught at LEAST one body. 

31: Noah likes to follow around all the new people he becomes friends with. 

32: Uzi likes Lego in general, but LOVES Bionicle. 

33: Bob was finally able to buy his own house with the profits he earned from SMG3's treasure hunts and the Void Rift Farm. 

34: The Black Mesa incident did occur in this AU, but it was on a much smaller scale compared to Half Life canon. While there wasn't a Seven Hour War, the combine are still present with multiple outposts and commandeered cities. 

35: Uzi's dad ABSOLUTELY DESPISES the Combine. 

36: Uzi got her ""gift"" from her mom. 

37: KS2 is only partially active nowadays. 

38: Rhode is not evil. 

39: Ruusul will do everything in his power to gain something from an investment he makes, successful or otherwise.

40: The YLW Soldier is no longer human.

41: Doctor Ridley was suffering from cancer before she joined the Church of the Glorious Evolution, a Cult founded shortly after the Cold War by an individual known as the Machine Herald.

42: The God Box's destruction will have unforseen consequences. 

43: Tödliche HATES being called ""Tod,"" but isn't an ass about it. 

44: It is common knowledge that Mann Co is the host of the largest Mercenary ring in known history, though liaisons such as Potman have a habit of leaving out that detail. Otherwise, all their business firms are still legitimate businesses, and the teams associated with each firm are actual employees that work these jobs while not on missions. There are even some employees who aren't even Mercenaries 

45: Most Mann Co Mercs are genuinely nice people both in and out of missions. The various teams treat each other as one big family, occasional drama and everything. 

46: While there are thousands of Mercenaries that work for Mann Co, each team normally sends out a group of around nine mercs at a time. This is so that each team has an easier time commanding their forces when multiple teams are called at once. 

47: Not all employees of Mann Co are Mercenaries. Almost half of them are just average people who happen to work for their firms. Some may even get the chance to BECOME a Mercenary if they so wished, while others may even be oblivious to the fact that they're even working alongside Mercenaries at all. 

48: It's a common tradition amongst team leaders to keep the badges of KIA or MIA Mercenaries to honor them. Some of them are originals, but they'll also have copies made while the original badge is sent back to the merc's family.

49: Mann Co provides Mercenaries with the means of training via recreational ""gamemodes"" of different types. All munitions used in these gamemodes are non lethal yet designed to simulate the impact of actual munitions, and ""players"" utilize specialized cloaking and teleportation tech to accomplish a ""death and respawn"" effect upon being eliminated without fatal harm. Elimination and respawn effects can even be customized to give the illusion of dead bodies, wounds, blood splatters, dismemberment, and even special effects like freezing and disintegration. There's also a plethora of Medics on standby in case of actual injury. 

50: Current available Mann Co business firms include Builders League United (BLU), Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED), the General Radio Network (GRN), Yard Logistics Workers (YLW), Organic Recreational Gardening (ORG), Paxton's Robotics & Plutonics (PRP), the Clinical Assistance Network (CAN), and Professional Networking Knowledge (PNK). 

51: The term ""Freelancer"" refers to Mercenaries that have opted to operate independently of the other teams. Unlike other Mercenaries, Freelancers work EXCLUSIVELY on missions and bounties. They are often described as being in a league of their own, using their unique skills to their advantage in ways other mercs usually don't. Some have even been shown to have abilities that others may see as unnatural. While they have been shown to work well with other teams, Freelancers often prefer to work alone or with other Freelancers. 

52: Each Mercenary is given a freshly minted badge designating their class and team upon joining said team to tell them apart from average employees. They also serve as a means of identification for each individual, much like traditional military dog tags. They can be worn on one's clothing, but they're usually kept out of sight while at work or off duty. 

53: The Valiant Assistance Coalition (VAC) is an international organization of peacekeepers. They often work closely with other organizations to assist in logistics, emergency containments, anomalous engagements, and humanitarian efforts. While a separate entity from Mann Co, the VAC does have members that work within Mann Co's ORG and PRP firms. 

54: Toadsworth has been running the Mushroom Kingdom in Princess Peach's absence, and SMG4 is still working on a way to turn her back to normal after the IGBP incident. 

55: This version of the SMG4 world has an extra continent that's divided into two large landmasses with various island change. This continent is where the Mushroom Kingdom is located, along with other areas such as the Sweetlands. I'm mainly going with this because it leaves much more room for exploration, plus it's more fun than having it be in the US or Australia. I've yet to settle on a fitting name for this eighth continent and I'm open to ideas. 

56: There are other Kingdoms besides the Mushroom Kingdom. There's the Sugar Canyon Kingdom in the Sweetlands, and Inkopolis is considered to be the capital of the Ink Kingdom. There's also the Pyantan Republic of Delfino, the Koopa Kingdom, the City State of WAAsberg where Wario lives, the Shy Boo Providences, City 17, the Smog Kingdom, and others. While not a kingdom or providence in the traditional sense, the Dark Web is run by an intricate network of criminal organizations and families. All of this is located on the continent's Eastern Landmass.

57: The Mushroom Kingdom was built atop the remains of the Enochian Empire centuries ago. Underground tunnels and sewers have been found to lead to these ruins on occasion. 

58: The Orokin Kingdom fell some time around 15BC, with its remnants scattered across the Void.

59: The continent is the only known place on this earth where Metarunner ruins are located. No one knows how truly ancient these ruins are, but it's believed they were from the Antediluvian Age.

60: There have been reports of large Pyramid Structures found deep underground. The purpose of these structures is still unknown. 

And that's it for the time being. If you have any more questions about this AU, feel free to ask.

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"".

\- Rent a modern 3 bed/2 bath apartment (doesn't need to be fancy but ideally updated)

\- Travel outside of Europe (North America, South America, Australia) 1x a year plus shorter travels throughout Europe

\- Eating out 2-3x a month at a mid-tier restaurant. ""Fine dining"" 4x a year.

\- Child would go to public school after daycare.

\- No idea regarding baby costs, estimates are based using mostly Canadian prices (without forex)

\- Also not sure on TV subscription pricing. Estimate is for Netflix, Prime, Disney+, football (La Liga + EPL) + HBO.

Would this be attainable with gross salaries of € 75k + € 40k a year?",1,1743271947.0,MovingToSpain,1,1.0,False

Still gonna be at least two comments from users who have zero other contributions to /r/standup in here like ""low ceilings"" and ""good drinks,"" but what can you do?

A **venue** is not just a physical space. It's also the business that runs the space, the people who work at that business, and the location of the space. We spend most of the time talking about the nature of the space, but the business and the people are often more important to determining whether comedy is gonna succeed there. 

**The space**: This is the easiest part to talk about, so let's start here. 

Everything that made a place bad for covid makes it good for comedy. You want low ceilings, people packed close together. My favorite shows are 40 people in a room designed to hold 30. Laughter is even more infectious than viroparticles, and so giving people the opportunity to share it with other people nearby can result in a very strong positive feedback loop which elevates even a mediocre performance to headlining laughter. 

The shape of the floor plan matters too. Ideally you want to minimize the total distance between each audience member and the performer, which means a room that's wide rather than deep - if the room is a piece of paper, the stage should be on the 11"" side, not the 8.5"" side. This means that cocktail bars, which are traditionally long and narrow with the only good place for the stage all the way at one end or the other, are often an uphill battle. L-shaped rooms, which are more common than you might think, are also not great; you've got *two* long skinny sections. 

You don't want distractions. TVs and pool tables in use during a comedy show mean there's no comedy show. The perfect scenario is a room that's separated entirely from the rest of the bar, with a door that closes. That prevents both most of the ambush comedy *and* the noise from a bartender shaking a martini. 

Finally, the acoustics matter. The modern brewery with its LVT floors and steel and laminate everywhere is an acoustic nightmare. 

That being said, one of my strongest-ever open mics was at a cocktail bar with a high ceiling - the sound setup and location (close to BART) made up for it. 

**The location**: People have to be able to get to your show. A copy-paste of the Comedy Cellar somewhere in the deserted part of Nebraska will be difficult for audience members to reach, even if they can somehow find out that the show exists. It's hard to get comics to show up for a gig in a small town far from their residence, too, even if an audience somehow materialized. 

In major metro areas, a lot of comics and audience members don't have cars. That means that if you want a show your venue has to be walkable from public transit. In car-dependent areas, you still need a reachable location. It doesn't necessarily have to be downtown, but it should be someplace people are used to going. 

There are exceptions to this. People will drive a few hundred miles to see Doug Stanhope or Bill Burr, but at that point, what matters isn't the venue, it's the talent. 

**The people**: The frustrating reality is that unless you're personally opening a bar or a restaurant and doing comedy there (sometimes called a ""comedy club"" ha ha I recognize the realities of the industry) you're probably going to have to produce a show at a venue that belongs to someone else. That person (or people) have their own ideas for what should go on in the space, and if those ideas don't line up with what makes a good show, you're going to have a hard time putting on a good show. The owner also has employees, who might be your primary points of contact, and might have their own ideas - the number of bartenders who are DJs and want to do sets in between comedians is staggering. It's important to recognize that you (the producer) and the other comics are also people who might have bad ideas of your own.  If your show starts succeeding even a little bit, those other comics are gonna want to produce stuff there, and the dynamics can be very frustrating. 

A great venue has management that pays attention to what's working to make a good show. 

**The business**: Some businesses aren't right for comedy. Good people can make L-shaped rooms with weird acoustics work. A good location can make up for that DJ bartender. But if the business is incompatible with comedy, no matter how badly you and the owners want to make it happen, you're in for long-term heartache as they lose money on the shows and decide to stop doing them. 

The most eager venues I've ever had were small-town bars that reached out to me directly, desperate for something new to offer their patrons. I asked both of them to turn off the TVs and sell tickets; they both wanted to let everyone come enjoy the show and just pay us a guarantee. As a result we ambushed about half the people in the place who were mad that they couldn't play pool any more. Bad show. Not worth the hundreds of dollars. Another place was a really nice lady at a coffee shop; the space has a high ceiling and bad acoustics, but I hoped that the prime downtown location would make it work. And it was okay, even with the light attendance, until someone walked in to order an espresso with fresh-ground beans. Sometimes, the right entertainment for a venue is music, not comedy. Maybe I should introduce them to those bartenders to come DJ.",2,1743271884.0,Standup,3,0.75,False
