So I'm 47 and just back into the dating  scene at the beginning of this year. Needless to say, its been horrid up to this point. Two weeks ago I got a match on Tinder... I start talking to the guy and I find out he is from Russia. Long story short, even through the broken English and horrible app translations, we hit it off. He is a long haul truck driver and  went out of his way on his route so that we could meet this morning for coffee. The man brings me flowers and we sit and talk for two and a half hours (google translate helped a lot). It was amazing ( and scary because being burned in the past sucked). We were both a little lost when it was time for him to go. What  now? This isn't  like he lives in my city, and we can just go on a date at  anytime, but we both want to see each other again. Then he asks me if he took time off work, would I go on a vacation with him. Yes, ladies. I too watch all the crime shows so am I going to go on a vacation with this man, to a remote location, alone? No, absolutely not. That being said, my thoughts are to compromise and ask if he'd  be willing to take a vacation to where I live so that we can essentially spend a week getting to know each other better. He would have to get a hotel as i wouldnt be comfortable with him staying with me (again, still stranger danger) and I do have time off, so we could spend nearly every day together exploring my backyard, where I feel safe. Although I know someone can put a facade on for a week, I can tell you that everything he has told me thus far has been the truth. ( I have a friend whose an internet slueth and even gave me his home address - unfortunately its across the country).
 Is this a good idea? Is this asking too much? We would then have a long distance relationship but we would also know if we felt it would be worth it. Thoughts?",1,1750017818.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1lc9jya,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lc9jya,Modaprime review,"I used to order from Modaboost for my modafinil, but I have read about how unreliable it has become. As someone who relies on this medication as a prescription and is not under any health insurance, I had to purchase my medication through vendors using my savings. Someone on Reddit recommended Modaprime, so I tried that. Unfortunately, modafinil is becoming more expensive and this is the only price that I could reasonably afford at this time. 

I ordered two packs of 200mg Modawake (one pack is 100 tablets) for $450 on 4/28/2025. I transferred over that amount in BTC to the BTC address emailed to me after my purchase. Next day, I received a tracking number and it was delivered on 5/3/2025. So far, the modawake feels great to be on. I even drink some additional coffee or tea with it to help boost my alertness. 

If anyone is in need of or is desiring modafinil, Modaprime is legit (especially if you‚Äôre in the USA)! Eric (the vendor) offered some extra free tablets with my next order if I leave a Reddit review. Thank you, Eric! ",1,1750017702.0,NootropicsHelp,0,0.99,False

1lc9ho6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lc9ho6/i_booked_an_escort_not_from_our_reality/,I booked an escort not from our reality.,"It started like any other day.

I work a typical 9 to 5 in a gray-walled office wedged between a refinery and a cold storage depot. It was nothing glamorous. Just payroll, inventory, and data entry. The warehouse out back hums with forklifts and pallets and smells like oil, steel, and stale coffee. It‚Äôs industrial purgatory. My job is to make sure the numbers line up and nobody‚Äôs skimming off the top.

I usually clock out around dusk, when the sodium lights flicker on and the sky turns bruised and yellow. That night, I lingered a little longer‚Äîtriple-checking a shipment invoice that didn‚Äôt sit right. A truckload of supplies had gone unlogged. No signature, no weight data, no product line. Just a blank space where there should have been something. Or someone.

From my second-floor office window, I had a clear view of the backloading dock.

That‚Äôs when I saw the truck.

A large, white freight hauler‚Äîunmarked, the kind that smells like bleach and cold sweat‚Äîbacked into the far bay with its lights off. It rolled in slow, deliberate, like it didn‚Äôt want to be seen. A man in a reflective vest emerged from the cab, then opened the rear doors.

And then‚Ä¶ they stepped out one by one.

Four women. At first glance, they looked like human girls, but they had unusual features. I couldn‚Äôt quite make them out as they each wore oversized coats they pulled tight around their bodies, as if they were trying to disappear into the fabric. Their eyes were wide searching the shadows, like prey searching for their predators. One stumbled slightly as she hit the concrete, catching herself with trembling fingers.

I should‚Äôve called someone.

But something stopped me. Something about their faces.

They were beautiful. Almost too beautiful. The kind of beauty that feels more¬†*designed*¬†than born. I squinted against the glass, trying to parse what I was seeing.

For example, one woman‚Äôs skin had a faint reddish hue, not from blush or windburn, but something deeper. She had undertones that shimmered when the light caught her cheek just right. Small, curling horns poked through the top of her head, as her dark black hair was cropped short just below her neck.

They looked too connected to her forehead to be prosthetic.

I told myself they were costumes. Makeup. Some kind of elaborate viral stunt. A haunted house promo maybe, or one of those weird immersive theater things rich people pay thousands for.

But what kind of show leaves its actors looking like they‚Äôre terrified out of their minds? What kind of role demands fear that raw?

¬†One of the girls looked right at me.

I caught the longing in her eyes, the fear, and the desperation. And in that moment, I knew she wasn‚Äôt playing a part.

None of them were.

A few men emerged from the yawning darkness of the warehouse. Their movements were slow, casual, like this was routine. No shouting, no barking of orders. Just calm, practiced movements. They didn‚Äôt have uniforms, but they wore dark jackets and work gloves. One of them held a clipboard, as if this was just another delivery to log.

The girls hesitated at the edge of the truck‚Äôs shadow, but a sharp gesture from one of the men sent them filing inside in a single, obedient line. No protest. No resistance. Just the slow, hollow shuffle of sandaled feet on concrete as they filed one by one single file into the warehouse.

Something about their silence made the hair rise on my arms.

Without thinking, I grabbed my keys and left the building. My heart jackhammered in my chest as I went to the back of the building, out of sight, where my vehicle was parked. I slid into my car and pulled away from my usual spot, circling around the far end of the lot, just past a rusted chain-link fence, where many unused vehicles remained in an unpaved lot. I tucked in beside a few of them, out of view, and killed the engine.

From there, I had a clear line of sight to the warehouse‚Äôs open bay.

The men were stripping the girls.

They peeled away the oversized coats like they were shedding packaging. The garments hit the floor in limp piles, revealing the girls' barely clothed bodies. Just jean shorts and bikini tops were covering them. The warehouse lights glared down on their skin, sterile and unflinching.

Each girl stood stiff as a statue. Eyes shut tight, arms locked at their sides like it might protect them, or maybe because they‚Äôd been told not to move. Their bodies trembled slightly in the chill, but they didn‚Äôt make a sound.

And then I saw them.

Really saw them.

The green-skinned girl was the first to break my sense of disbelief. Her hair was writhing, coiling. At first, I thought it was some kind of clever prop, but my blood chilled when I now got a better look. Each strand of her hair was alive, wriggling independently like it had its own mind.

Snakes! Her hair was made of snakes!

They hissed and coiled, agitated, though she stood perfectly still. Her skin wasn‚Äôt painted. It was smooth, lime-colored, patterned faintly with scales that shimmered under the fluorescent lights. Her pupils were vertical slits, and I swear‚Äîwhen she opened her eyes for a flicker of a second‚Äîshe looked directly at me.

The red-skinned girl beside her was slightly taller, her horns curling back over her head like ram's horns, polished and dark. Her skin was a muted crimson, not firetruck red but more like old blood. There was something subtly wrong with the air around her, like heat shimmered off her body even though it was cold. Her expression was blank, distant, but her lips parted slightly, showing two elongated canines.

She had to be a succubus.

The aquatic girl, blue as sea glass, stood next to her. Her skin had a faint iridescence, and her collarbones bore subtle ridges where her gills fluttered, as if testing the air. Her eyes were wide and silver-flecked, and her feet, fully webbed, shifted on the concrete like she didn‚Äôt know how to stand upright for long. She had long, elaborate dark blue hair that cascaded down her back. She looked... newer. Less hardened. Her arms were mostly human, but around her elbows the scales thickened, hinting at something underneath that didn‚Äôt belong on land.

She looked a lot like a mermaid, only with legs.

And then there was the third woman, the fairy.

God, she looked fragile. And she was so small. She had to be no taller than five feet. The kind of thin that suggested she hadn‚Äôt eaten in weeks. Her skin was a cold shade of ivory with almost runic veins etched all over her body in elaborate patterns. Her mouth was clamped shut, but when she turned slightly, I caught a glimpse of her wings. They were long, slender, not the cartoonish kind, but real, elaborate and elegant. Her normally happy expression was absent, replaced by a cold, gaunt look.

One of the men walked up behind them and began fastening black zip ties around their wrists; tight, unforgiving. He moved mechanically, as though binding exotic animals for transport. He looped their ankles with chains, thin enough to walk in, thick enough to control. The girls flinched at the contact but said nothing. The succubus winced as the plastic bit into her wrists. The mermaid‚Äôs eyes welled slightly, but the tears didn‚Äôt fall.

Then the man did something that made my blood run cold.

He slapped the gorgon across the ass, hard. The sound echoed through the empty lot like a gunshot. She didn‚Äôt react. She didn‚Äôt cry out or turn her head. But I saw the snakes recoil violently, hissing, writhing with fury she couldn‚Äôt show.

The men herded them deeper into the warehouse like livestock.

I just sat there, trying to process what the fark I was seeing.

Because in that moment, one horrifying thought lodged deep in my skull:

These girls weren‚Äôt just being trafficked.

They weren‚Äôt even human.

My fingers were frozen on the steering wheel, heart pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. My brain was screaming at me to call someone. Anyone! But who the hell would believe me? Hey, officer, I just watched four mythological monster girls get taken into a warehouse at the center of the city.

Yeah, because 911 wouldn‚Äôt tell me not to tie up the line.

As they were led further inside, the light grew dimmer. The warehouse swallowed them, but not entirely. A single floodlight buzzed overhead, casting a broad yellow cone over a low, makeshift couch positioned just beyond the bay entrance‚Äîcobbled together from old cushions and tarp-covered padding. It looked like something torn from a brothel or holding cell. Stained. Improvised.¬†*Used*.

The girls were sat there in a silent row, facing the lot. Facing¬†*me*.

I sank lower in my seat, heart pounding again. From the shadows of the junked patrol cars, wedged between a rusted pickup and a hollowed-out school bus, I prayed they couldn‚Äôt see me.

But something told me they could.

The men who brought them in moved to the back of the warehouse. One flipped a switch. The bay doors began to roll shut with a slow metallic groan, but they stopped just shy of closing completely. Maybe five or six feet off the ground. Enough to let in air. Or maybe to let something else out.

Then they left the girls alone.

And in the silence that followed, the girls sat motionless‚Äîlike artifacts on display, too exhausted to cry and too hopeless to run. Their heads drooped, and their limbs, still bound, trembled subtly. Some stared at nothing. Others scanned the warehouse‚Äôs rusted walls with the expression of someone already dreaming of escape.

Then, all at once, their eyes locked with mine.

It was almost imperceptible. No sudden movement. No gasp. Just a shift subtle, mechanical, instinctive‚Äîas their eyes aligned with mine. As if they‚Äôd known I was there. It wase the whole time. As if they‚Äôd been¬†*waiting*.

Their gazes didn‚Äôt move from me. They didn‚Äôt dare turn their heads, didn‚Äôt twitch or gesture or alert their handlers. They stayed perfectly still, communicating only through their eyes. A look passed between them, brief, but barely perceptible. Then back to me.

And what I saw in their expressions wasn‚Äôt malice or hunger.

It was¬†*grief*. Unfiltered, soul-flattening¬†*grief*. The kind you don‚Äôt fake.

The gorgon girl sat with her knees pressed tightly together, her wrists zip-tied behind her back, shoulders curled forward like she was trying to hide her form. Her snakes no longer moved‚Äîthey hung limp, defeated, as if they, too, had been broken. Her green skin was mottled now, blotched along her arms and thighs, and there were bruises and deep purple welts just below her bikini line. Her eyes locked on mine. And behind them, desperation.

The succubus looked older. Not by years, but by mileage. Her light red skin shimmered faintly under the light, not glittery but¬†*raw*, like an open wound healing over. Her horns curved back like polished obsidian, beautiful but scarred‚Äîone chipped at the base, like it had been cracked with a blunt instrument. Her chest was bound by a fraying bikini top that looked too tight, clearly not designed for comfort. Her lips moved slightly, whispering something I couldn‚Äôt hear.

The mermaid girl sat with her legs drawn up, feet tucked beneath her. Her blue-scaled skin looked drier than before, as though the air was hurting her. The edges of her gills twitched, struggling to take in oxygen, and her chest rose and fell rapidly. Her bikini top was damp in places, stained with something that didn‚Äôt look like water. There were red rings around her wrists, deeper than the others, like she'd struggled the most. Her silver eyes welled with tears that never fell.

And the fairy girl‚Ä¶

She sat straight-backed, as if posture was all she had left. Her legs were crossed at the ankles, but the chain dug into her skin, leaving little bloody half-moons. Her skin was paler than the others, almost translucent now, the veins beneath glowing faintly blue in the dark. Her eyes, glimmering like diamonds, glinted as they found mine. She looked at me the longest.

It wasn‚Äôt hunger. It was¬†*recognition*. Like she knew who I was. Or had known someone like me once. And still, I didn‚Äôt move. A part of me¬†*wanted*¬†to. To leap from the car and scream at the men, alert law enforcement, rush in there with a tire iron like some kind of bargain-bin savior. But another part, deeper, colder, hesitated.

Because I¬†*knew*¬†things. I‚Äôd read the stories. The reports. The conspiracy threads.

Succubi don‚Äôt need consent. They drain you while you sleep. Medusas turn men to stone‚Äîsometimes only from the waist down. And mermaids? The old kind, the¬†*real*¬†kind? Much of mythology says they pulled sailors into the deep just to watch them drown. And lastly, not all fairies were benevolent.

These women could have lured dozens to their deaths. Maybe more. Could I really afford to take my chances? But if that was true, if these weren‚Äôt victims but predators...

Then who were¬†*those men*?

I glanced back at the warehouse. No insignias. No badges. No containment gear. Just gloves and zip ties. Who do they work for anyway?

If they were from the SCP Foundation, or the Global Occult Coalition, or whatever black-budget monster-hunting agency the internet whispered about, why were they¬†*here*¬†of all places? Why a rotting warehouse off I-95 in the industrial epicenter of North Miami? Why not a deep-sea lab or some forest bunker where no one could see? It didn‚Äôt make sense. But it was more reason to believe that this wasn‚Äôt containment. It was commerce.

And I had a suspicion as to precisely what kind.

My hands moved before my conscience could catch up. I pulled out my phone, my heart was still pounding, and didn‚Äôt even bother opening Google. This wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd find on Yelp.

So, I downloaded Tor. Because whatever those girls were, they weren‚Äôt the only ones being sold. And I guarantee you I wouldn‚Äôt have found them anywhere else.

Within minutes, I was browsing the dark web and it wasn‚Äôt long before I discovered the classifieds. I wont go into detail of what else I came across, just know I found what I was looking for.

It surprisingly did not take too long. Within minutes I was browsing escorts on an exclusive dark web form. And I found women of various ‚Äòexotic‚Äô subspecies on a website not normally accessible on google. They had fairies, pixies, succubae, harpies, and even the bird-like sirens all available for ‚Äòrent‚Äô on their site. They have clients of all kinds, ranging from human to non-human.

Confirmed.

My only question was, if they were being trafficked from other dimensions or worlds, then it would stand to reason that some kind of government agency would be watching stuff like this. Getting curious, I decided to look up the instructions needed to ‚Äòbook‚Äô a session.

But before I could type a single letter, something happened.

A low mechanical whine filled the air outside my vehicle, coming from across the lot. I looked up from the phone to turn my gaze immediately upon the warehouse. I saw the door yawning open. Thick shadows peeled away as halogen lights spilled out from within. And there they were.

The girls. All four of them. Led out in single file, like livestock.

The two men from before‚Äîheavyset, pale-skinned, wearing nondescript utility jackets‚Äîushered them forward with quick, mechanical hand gestures. I could hear faint commands muffled through the air: ‚ÄúKeep your eyes down.‚Äù ‚ÄúMove.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo noise.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt need to threaten. The girls were already broken in.

Each of them was bound now. Not just zip ties around their wrists like before, but full restraints‚Äîankles shackled together with thick, black iron cuffs, arms trussed behind their backs with heavy leather belts. And this time‚Ä¶ each one had a¬†**ball gag**¬†strapped into their mouths, tightly enough that their cheeks bulged and their breathing rasped through their nostrils.

Their outfits‚Äîif you could even call them that‚Äîwere degraded even further. Small bikini tops stretched taut across their chests, barely covering anything. Short shorts clung to their hips like afterthoughts, riding high between their thighs. They weren‚Äôt costumes anymore. They were¬†*uniforms*. Assigned. Dehumanizing.

The¬†**gorgon woman**¬†walked at the front. Her green skin shimmered slightly under the fluorescent light, and her snake-hair writhed weakly, like it had been sedated. Her eyes scanned the area as she walked, darting left and right in brief jerks. She looked for an escape route, maybe. I watched her gaze pass over the lot. And then, it hit my car. Her pupils sharpened. Locked. Our eyes met.

Behind her, the¬†**succubus**¬†shuffled forward, her crimson skin marked with bruises along her ribs. Her horns had been shaved down since I last saw her. Roughly. Unevenly. A punishment, maybe. Her tail twitched behind her like it was trying to hide.

The¬†**mermaid girl**¬†walked in stiff, halting steps, her webbed toes curled in shame. Her gills flared weakly with each shallow breath, irritated from the dry air. She winced with every step, like the asphalt burned her feet.

The fairy, or nymph-like girl was the last to be loaded. She was tiny‚Äîno taller than 4‚Äô11, but the way she moved, the way her body trembled with each step, she looked even smaller. Fragile. Breakable. Her translucent wings had been cruelly pinned‚Äîfolded tight against her back beneath a leather harness that pressed down hard, the wing joints visibly strained and twitching under the weight. Every few seconds, they fluttered instinctively, as if trying to open, only to be jerked back down by the restraint.

They were loaded into a large white truck again‚Äîsame model as before, only now without the subtlety. The rear doors were wide open, revealing a padded interior with low red lights, a bench lining either side, and steel rings bolted to the walls‚Äîanchor points.

One by one, the girls were pushed up the small ramp and chained inside. The doors slammed shut with the finality of a tomb.

I made a decision.

I threw my phone into the passenger seat and turned the key in the ignition. I didn‚Äôt care about the form anymore. I needed to¬†*know*¬†where they were going. I pulled out slowly, keeping three car lengths behind the truck as it rolled out of the warehouse lot and onto the main road. I killed my headlights.

The city was quiet at this hour, nothing but low neon glows and the occasional flicker of a crosswalk sign. The truck didn‚Äôt move fast. Like it had no fear of being followed.

It took me less than ten minutes to realize where they were going.

**The Strip is just outside the Miami International Airport.**

A ring of sleazy motels, gas stations, hourly-rate rooms, and concrete towers baking under yellow-orange streetlamps. I passed a billboard advertising ‚ÄúFantasy Island Spa‚Äù and another offering discounted ‚Äúcompanionship services.‚Äù Every building seemed to lean sideways with mildew and regret.

The truck pulled into the back lot of a one-story motel that didn‚Äôt even bother hiding its purpose. No signs. No lights. Just faded brick and boarded-up windows. The kind of place where you checked in through a thick glass slot and never asked for towels.

I parked again, this time behind a shuttered laundromat across the street. I watched the men open the back doors to the truck.

First came the¬†**gorgon woman**¬†again. Still at the front. Her feet dragged as they pulled her out by the arm. She tried to resist, but her shackled legs gave her no leverage. One of the men¬†*shoved*¬†her forward, and she fell hard onto the gravel, the gag making a wet, choking thud against her lips. She whimpered. A sound I could barely hear but¬†*felt*¬†in my teeth.

The snakes on her head twitched frantically, like they were trying to fight back. Two men got out of the vehicle and hoisted her up. She walked gingerly on two feet barely covered with sandals, the two men guiding her up the paved sidewalk.

The motel itself met every definition of ‚Äòseedy‚Äô you could think of. It was only one story, and the building itself couldn‚Äôt have had more than a dozen rooms carved into it. The overhead sign was gone, and the neon-lit vacancy light was only half lit. A single row of doors lit by flickering amber bulbs that hummed with bugs

The faded green paint peeling like sunburned skin and security bars warped from age or misuse. The overhead sign was gone, torn off or collapsed long ago. Only a skeletal frame remained, rusted through and straining against the wind. Beneath it, a busted neon¬†*VACANCY*¬†light glowed half-lit and stuttering, casting the letters¬†*V-A-C-C-Y*¬†across the parking lot like a joke no one was in on. The place looked like it was functional, but barely.

I saw them take the gorgon woman to one of the doors, I faintly made out the number 12 just above as the door opened and she was escorted inside. I looked back down at my phone, and reopened the Tor browser. My eyes went to the unnamed website where I found the escort services. I adjusted my location accordingly to Miami.

I waited a few minutes.

And then, I found her. It was the gorgon woman. I texted the number below. I waited a few more minutes before I got a response. The reply came in a green text bubble. Simple. Too simple.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

That was it. There was no name or greeting. Just a blunt set of instructions. It felt less like an invitation and more of a transaction.

I stared at the message for a while. My thumb hovered over the screen. A part of me kept waiting for a second reply. Or a clarification. Or maybe even a joke, but that was wishful thinking at this point. I wanted a reason not to go in there, and there were too many to list. I wanted to believe that the gorgon lady wanted to eat me, or turn me into stone. But I just couldn‚Äôt.

I glanced back across the street.

Room 12 was dark again, the window light had been clicked off. The only thing marking it from the other rooms was the faint, uneven scrawl of the number above the door, its paint chipping off.

The parking lot was still empty. No cars, pedestrians or other signs of life, except for a single curtain twitching in one of the rooms further down the row. I didn‚Äôt like that. Someone was watching. Or something was. I sat back in the seat and tried to breathe, but my lungs were tight.

This wasn‚Äôt curiosity anymore. Not really. It was something colder, heavier. Like I‚Äôd seen too much already, and now I wasn‚Äôt¬†*allowed*¬†to look away. No. I¬†*couldn‚Äôt*¬†look away.

I stared at the message again.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

I took a deep breath and exited my vehicle, making my way across the street and to the motel. I walked up to door number 12. I knocked twice. I technically was a brown belt in BJJ and had light striking skills with taekwondo, so in that department I had some kind of plan should someone want to get physical with me.

After a few minutes, the door slowly opened, and the gorgon woman looked up at me. I saw that she was covered in a silky smooth, see-through bathrobe. She tucked a few snakes behind her ear as she let off a meek, yet nervous smile.

‚ÄúPlease come in.‚Äù

I nodded as she took my hand and guided me into the room. Her hand was cold.

Her 5‚Äô2 frame he gently guided my 5‚Äô10 self to the bed. The snakes coiled behind her ear twitched once more as if whispering something I wasn‚Äôt meant to hear.

The door shut behind me with a soft click that sounded louder than it should have in the silence. The room was dimly lit, only by a bedside lamp with a cracked shade. The air was thick with a strange mix of scents: cheap rosewater, stale sweat, and perfume that had a rosy, yet pungent odor. It was inviting, yet it stung my nostrils.

There was no music, or TV. Only the sounds of her and my breathing filled the room.

She gently sat me down on the bed an stood over me. She then very slowly undid the sash, dropping it to the floor, letting the robe fall open. She was wearing a tight-fitting thong and a bra. It wasn‚Äôt long before I noticed the cuts, bruises and welts along her body. Her eyes were heavy.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

She forced a smile and nodded, then straddling me on the bed. She begun to ravish my neck, purring like a kitten.

‚ÄúSo strong. So handsome.‚Äù She giggled.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have sex.‚Äù

She then looked at me like I killed ten people. I then picked her up and gently laid her on the bed. She sat up to look at me as I sat down next to her.

‚ÄúCan we‚Ä¶ talk?‚Äù

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúTalk?‚Äù

I nodded.

Her eyes went wide as she pressed her fingers to her temple. ‚ÄúT-talk? You w-want to-you want to talk?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúTo get to know you better.‚Äù

Her eyes widened as she just stared at me like I was the president of the United States.

‚ÄúNobody has ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶.‚Äù she stammered, and then shook her head. ‚ÄúIm not allowed to answer questions.‚Äù

I then heard a pounding on the door.

‚ÄúAlina! You better not be telling anyone anything about us!‚Äù she heard someone scream.

‚ÄúOh no. He sounds drunk.‚Äù She raved, and then turned to me. ‚ÄúYou need to-‚Äù

The door slammed open and a tall man about my height came out.

‚ÄúYou! Outside! Me and the lady need to have a little talk.‚Äù

I glanced at the gorgon woman. Now the fresh tears were streaming down her face as she clutched the blanket from the bed to her chest.

I got up from the bed, frozen and I just stared at the man, my stupid neurodivergence not knowing what to do.

‚ÄúAre you deaf?! Leave now!‚Äù he then stormed over to me.

His breath hit my face, sour and hot, as he grabbed a fistful of my collar. My brain lagged for a split second, choking on the sudden pressure, the shouting, the chaos.

And then everything snapped into place. I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI¬†*reacted*. I went for a straight body lock and tackled him to the ground. I immediately got into position and executed a perfect heel hook

I dropped low, my arms wrapping around his midsection like coiled steel. A deep¬†*body lock*. My hips turned, and I drove him backwards off his balance, tackling him hard onto the dirty motel floor with a hollow¬†*THUMP*¬†that shook the lampshade.

We hit the ground. He tried to scramble, but I was already repositioning.

I grabbed his leg‚Äîcontrolled the heel‚Äîdropped my weight sideways, and twisted. Fast. Brutal. A perfect heel hook. There was a pop. Then a scream. High-pitched, animal, involuntary.

He flailed, slamming his fists on the floor, howling in raw, guttural pain as his knee exploded under the torque. I moved over to his head and executed an anaconda choke around his neck. He was out cold in seconds.

I stood, chest heaving.

The gorgon woman was still on the bed, shaking, her snakes hissing low and defensive around her face like a living halo. But she was staring at me differently now, with widened eyes filled with awe and admiration.

‚ÄúYou-‚Äù she stuttered. ‚Äú-You fought for me.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess I did what anyone would do.‚Äù

She let off a slight smirk, looking up at me like a lost child who just found her mother. She let out a breath that was almost a laugh, and a small, trembling smile curled at her lips.

I turned to her, helping her off the floor. ‚ÄúAlina, we don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äù

She took my hand slowly, like she was afraid she‚Äôd wake up if she moved too fast. Her fingers were cold and delicate, but they gripped mine like she didn‚Äôt want to let go, a light smirk playing on her lips.

I peaked out the door. I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Then I turned back to Alina.

‚ÄúCan you walk?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù She then winced. Her balance swayed as she stood, her hand slapping against the wall to steady herself.

‚ÄúThen we‚Äôre leaving. Right now.‚Äù

We stepped out into the heavy, damp night air. The parking lot was still empty‚Äîno headlights, no engines, no sign of the other traffickers. We both emerged from the room. But she was still wobbly, holding onto the doorframe for support. I turned back to her.

‚ÄúUgh. My head.‚Äù She said holding a hand to her head.

Without thinking, I moved back to her, and swept her up into my arms. She was lighter than I expected‚Äîlike she was made of silk and bone and smoke. Her arms instinctively wrapped around my neck, her face resting just under my chin. I felt her breath on my collarbone. Soft, yet Shaky. The snakes on her head curled quietly, docile now, like they too had calmed.

After a few steps, I felt her shift slightly in my arms.

‚ÄúYou smell like‚Ä¶ laundry detergent,‚Äù she murmured, voice barely audible.

I tilted my head. ‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ that a bad thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ warm,‚Äù she said, slightly giggling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre warm.‚Äù

I glanced down. Her cheeks had gone faintly pink, and she was staring up at me, eyelids heavy. That little smile returned, slightly drowsy, but undeniably real. Something soft bloomed between us, buried beneath the fear and bruises and neon motel lights.

As we walked over to the car, she reached up with her hand to trace my jawline, her touch featherlight‚Äîlike she wasn‚Äôt sure I was solid. Her smile brightened, a flicker of something radiant breaking through the haze of everything she'd endured.

I opened the passenger door for her. She hesitated only a moment before slipping in, curling up against the seat like it was the first real rest she‚Äôd had in days. Maybe weeks. As I pulled away from the laundromat, the silence in the car felt different. Not empty. Just‚Ä¶ full of things we couldn‚Äôt say yet.

The city rolled past in blurred halos of orange and blue. Traffic lights blinked on empty corners. Planes cut across the sky far overhead, heading to places that still felt like fiction to people like us. Every now and then, I could feel her eyes on me. Watching. Studying. Not in fear, but in curiosity. Like she was trying to memorize me. Each time I glanced over, she‚Äôd quickly look away, but not before I caught the edge of a smile playing on her lips.

Outside, the streets of Miami drifted by, quiet and gleaming with midnight sheen. But inside that car, something had changed. This wasn‚Äôt a rescue anymore. It wasn‚Äôt survival.

It was the start of something else.

Something far more nefarious than a local escort ring.",2,1750017555.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Today, I want to speak to you about a truth we can no longer ignore: millions of children in Africa go to bed hungry every single night. Not because of anything they‚Äôve done wrong. Not because they don‚Äôt dream, or hope, or try. But simply because they were born in the wrong place, in a world that doesn‚Äôt share opportunity fairly.
While we throw away food, a child dies of hunger every 10 seconds. And yet, just a few dollars‚Äîthe price of a coffee‚Äîcan save a life. Yes, it‚Äôs that simple. Every donation means a plate of food, a spark of hope, a second chance at life.
We may not be able to change the whole world overnight, but we can change someone‚Äôs world. Today. Right now.
Please donate. Because for you, it‚Äôs easy. For them, it means everything.
Thank you.

Me and my wife (early 30s, Indian origin, currently settled in US) have 11 days (25 Nov 2025 - 06 Dec 2025) to travel in South New Zealand. We are vegetarians (egg/dairy OK, fish and meat not), doing a self-drive loop ‚Äî landing in Queenstown, departing from Christchurch. (Open to other way as well. Our international flights are inbound to and outbound from Auckland).

What we like/prefer

* Do natural stuff; scenic routes and take in beautiful New Zealand
* want to do some thrilling activities in Queenstown (Bungy and Luge; okay to skip skydive)
* okay to stay away from cities,
* Planning for 3 dedicated hikes with max of 4-5 hrs per hike; small walks are ok
* okay to splurge on worth while activities and cut back on hotels and stays. Will prefer hotels/motels though not hostel as we are a couple

Research so far

* I think I have done enough research for first 6-7 days with Focus on Queenstown, Fiords, Wanaka, Mt Cook area
* Mostly scourged reddit threads and used chatgpt a lot

Without further ado; here is my day to day planned

* Day 1 Nov 25 Tuesday: Land in Queenstown around 10 AM
   * Pick up rental car from Apex Car Rental (dont charge 1 way fee)
   * Mandatory drive to Glenorchy (heard it‚Äôs one of NZ's best).
   * Patagonia Chocolates, Balls and Bangles, Fergburger (if vegeterian available, call in phone order to avoid lines)
   * Drive to Te Anau for the night.
* Day 2 Nov 26 Wednesday; One of the heaviest days
   * Early morning drive to Milford Sound (\~4-4:30AM) for cruise.
   * Milford Sound Cruise + Scenic Stops (Suggestion is to get the earliest boat cruise 7-7:30 AM. Most cruise offer similar experiences. Feel free to name drop company name)
   * After cruise stop at The Chasm, Lake Marian, or Key Summit (quick scenic hikes/waterfalls). Realistically, I think we can do only Chasm lakeand Key Summit hike because I want to reach Te Anau at 4 PM
   * 4 PM: Wings & Water floatplane scenic flight over Doubtful + Dusky Sounds (excited for this!). I dont want to do overnight doubtful sound cruise to save time (1 whole day plus it is expensive as well). I am open to suggestions here as well if you guys think I should dedicate 1 whole day here. The drawbacks for helicopter/sea planes I heard is that ""as much beautiful and breathtaking it is, it gets over in 45m - 1hr 30 mins). cruise offers the serenity in wilderness for almost 6-8 hrs""
   * Push through and reach queenstown no matter how late it is. If there is still energy, go to Moke Lake for star gazing (if tired, then swap it with St Johns Observatory in Tekapo)
* Day 3 Nov 27 Thursday; adventure filled day
   * Have to do bungy (There were 3 options, Kawarau Bridge Bungy, Nevis Bungy, The Ledge Bungy. Ledge Bungy at convenient location near Luge)
   * Luge + Skygondola 
   * Shotover/Skippers Jet or Ziplining (via BookMe).
   * If all of this is not possible due to tiredness or bad weather; then off load some to day 4
* Day 4 Nov 28 Friday;
   * Left over activities from Day 3
   * Queenstown Hill (optional light summit hike ‚Äî not one of top 3 hikes)
   * Wye Creek Trail (to helipad ‚Äî optional secondary hike)
   * Kelvin Heights / Lake Hayes loop if weather isn‚Äôt great
   * Arrowtown Chinese village (optional early afternoon stroll)
   * 4 PM: Drive to Wanaka via Cardrona (scenic route; as to be 4 PM to catch the beauty)
      * Stop at Cardrona Hotel & Distillery
   * Stay: Wanaka (Night 4)
*  Day 5 Nov 29 Saturday:
   * 8:00 AM: Depart for Rob Roy Glacier Track (\~1 hr drive + 3‚Äì4 hr hike)
   * 12:30 PM: Return to Wanaka for quick lunch
   * 2:00 PM: Paragliding at Treble Cone (check wind forecast)
   * 4:00 PM: Visit Lake Hawea (quick scenic stop or lakeside coffee)
   * 5:30 PM: Explore Wanaka Lavender Farm (late afternoon light = good photos)
   * Backup Option: Swap paragliding for Day 6 if weather prevents Day 5 launch
   * Stay: Wanaka (Night 5)
* Day 6 Nov 30 Sunday:
   * Drive to Mt Cook (\~2.5‚Äì3 hr)
      * Stop at Alpine Lavender Farm (if missed Day 5 or as swap for Wanaka one)
      * Scenic drive via Lindis Pass (photogenic, winding road)
   * 2:00 PM: Hooker Valley Track (3 hr return)
   * Optional:
      * Tasman Glacier Viewpoint (45‚Äì60 mins)
      * Peter‚Äôs Lookout (sunset views)
      * Stargazing (dark sky reserve)
   * Stay: Mt Cook Village or nearby (Night 6)
* Day 7 Dec 01 Monday:
   * Drive to Lake Tekapo
   * Visit Church of the Good Shepherd
   * Walk by Lake Tekapo, enjoy turquoise views
   * Optional: Hot Springs or Mt John Observatory

I think I have planned this far. Concerns:

1. Overestimating our abilities to do stuff on Day 2,3 and 6. Can add 1 more day here. If you guys think thats the case; then I will only 3 days left
2. Dont mind rushing at the cost of little discomfort and tiredness but also dont want to do stuff for the sake of checkmark. So struggling between enjoying the nature v cover as much stuff as possible
3. I still have Hanmer Springs, Kaikoura (Whale flights) and Hokitika Gorge but geographically they are quite far and would have to drop some stuff on either coast. Also it has been advisable to not drive more than 4-4.5 hours a day; as google maps tend to under estimate the driving time
4. I have to reach CHC by Dec 6 and return the car there. Thinking to book the 4 PM flight to Auckland

  
Thanking you guys in advance. Hopefully u/coalcliff and u/Kiwieeiwik see my post. I have copy pasted so many of your answers to my notes.

1lc9e06,https://www.reddit.com/r/romance/comments/1lc9e06/a_chelsea_morning/,A Chelsea Morning,"Chelsea stood in her new apartment, squishing her toes into the thick, plush pile carpeting and staring out the window. Even after the work she had put into her graduation, the excitement and festivities, none of it felt real yet. 



The hard work had proved worthwhile. After sending only a few applications and demo tapes, she had been picked up by KCTV to start as their new meteorologist. *I can‚Äôt wait,* she thought excitedly.



Her head was still spinning with the excitement of that phone call and the whirlwind of packing, plane ticket acquisition, taxi cabs, her new apartment, an expense account, and the complete rush of these last minute surprises. Even now, she stood in her apartment, thinking, *I feel absolutely dizzy!*



Kansas City was a far cry from New York, where she customarily checked the windows at night to make sure they were locked. *This is definitely an upgrade,* she grinned to herself. 



Chelsea opened the screen door and stepped out onto the balcony. Everything looked fresh and clean to her. The air was lighter and she could breathe more deeply than she had prior.



Chelsea hadn't realized how dirty the streets of New York were until she had gained this comparison. She sipped a warm coffee and clucked under her breath, ‚ÄúSometimes perspective is everything.‚Äù 



A full moon rose in a night sky, littered with stars, as though it were a personal greeting. She was rarely able to see stars in the city. *This is a treat,* she mused. Chelsea felt she had accidentally landed exactly where she belonged. 



She stood, taking in her surroundings, in jeans and a light tank top, with a soft breeze whipping her blonde hair to and fro. It had been an exhausting day and she was glad to have a day to unpack before starting work. Chelsea was disheveled, hair tangled, wearing no makeup, and felt completely content. 



She stood in the shadows, smiling softly, chin tilted up in thanksgiving to the moon and stars, and whatever luck had brought her here, when a voice disturbed her reverie. 



‚ÄúHello!‚Äù 



Chelsea looked around unable to detect where it had come from. Then she heard it again and the whereabouts of the disembodied voice snapped into focus. She leaned out to peer onto a neighboring balcony to discover a large parakeet perched on the arm of a man. 



‚ÄúHello!‚Äù 



She threw her head back laughing at the silliness of the situation, and the delightful sound of her laughter made the man turn and lean out to view her balcony. 



‚ÄúWell, hello, miss. You must be my new neighbor.‚Äù 



Chelsea stepped closer to address the bird and its owner. ‚ÄúHello. I'm Chelsea McMahon. Very pleased to meet you, and your bird,‚Äù she offered, smiling. 



‚ÄúI'm Pete Scott and this is my parakeet, Axel. If you're not too busy packing, why don't we share a drink on the balcony, *unless your husband would object.‚Äù* Pete held her eyes with his stare, holding his breath and waiting anxiously. 



Chelsea glanced back into her apartment and stumbled, ‚ÄúI really should be unpacking.‚Äù But the way he seemed to inhale her, his attention so focused, and his grass green eyes pulling her to him, like a magnet, made her throw caution to the wind, ‚ÄúOkay, one drink. You're on!‚Äù 



Pete disappeared into his apartment and offered a grateful thanks, ‚ÄúGood boy, Axel!‚Äù He picked up a bottle of wine, two folding chairs, and quickly appeared at Chelsea's door before she could change her mind. 



The attraction was instant and before Chelsea knew it, they had talked until the hour had grown very late. 



Pete hugged her firmly at the door, loathe to release the magnificent creature whom Axel had discovered. He kissed her lightly, still drinking her in, and said, ‚ÄúLet me be your tour guide when you get a day off. I drive a taxi. If you promise to sit up front with me and hold my hand, I'll turn the meter off and we can get lost - *and found together*.‚Äù 



Chelsea's mouth dropped open as she struggled for words. He stared into her eyes, straight down to the bottom of her soul, silently willing her to agree. 



‚ÄúOkay, it's a date and Pete, thanks for this evening.‚Äù Pete replied, still holding her hand as he backed away slightly, ‚ÄúIt's entirely my pleasure. I'm certainly glad that Axel had the good sense to greet you this evening.‚Äù 



Chelsea closed the door and leaned back against it offering up a silent prayer, ‚ÄúThank you, God! My life is a fairytale!‚Äù 



Pete retreated into his apartment where he sat for a long time, feeding Axel treats and recalling Chealsea's laughter, carried to him on a summer breeze,‚Äù which had assuredly changed his life irrevocably this evening. Happiness buoyed his spirit. 



He had watched her unwittingly bewitch him in guileless movements; lightly swiping a windblown strand of hair from her face, her tinkling laughter at small absurdities, nothing like the women he had dated prior; all of them armed to the teeth with defensiveness and cloaked in resentment. There was a refreshing ease to being in Chelsea's company. 



She was, Pete imagined, a woman who could drink champagne with executives as easily as enjoy a soda and hotdog at a carnival. He patted Axel affectionately as he put the bird into a cage, whispering, ‚ÄúYou did good, old boy! Who knew you had such good taste?‚Äù 



Her first week at KCTV was wildly busy. Chelsea rushed to various assignments without even enough time to stop for a burger. 



Evenings were filled with purchasing appropriate clothing for television, sitting with hair and makeup artists, lighting checks, reading from teleprompters, and making a mad dash from one destination to the next. She had never had a challenge quite as demanding and she was determined to prove herself. 



Pete watched her come and go, waiting and hoping. He hadn't wanted to make her first week more stressful than it was. Then, on a Saturday, late at night, he heard her sliding glass door slide open. He quickly retrieved Axel and slipped out onto his own balcony where he sat listening quietly. 



Then he heard it; a voice barely audible, just above a whisper, ‚ÄúPete? Are you there?‚Äù 



Pete opened his mouth to respond, but Axel beat him to it.



‚ÄúHello!‚Äù 



He quickly put Axel away and went straight to Chelsea's door. She greeted him warmly and Pete could see she was beyond exhausted. 



Swiftly, he folded her into his arms protectively and she collapsed against his chest. He picked her up and carried her to bed. Kissing her lightly, holding her troubled gaze with his own, he whispered, ‚ÄúTrust me.‚Äù She did. 



Pete peeled off her shorts and tunic, and laid down beside her, careful to keep her encircled and safe. He gently held her against his chest, issuing, ‚ÄúClose your eyes. Rest. Let me protect you tonight.‚Äù 



Chelsea did as he asked with tears of relief stinging her eyes. She tried to speak, as the tension left her body, but Pete wouldn't have it. ‚ÄúShhh, just rest,‚Äù he comforted her, stroking her face, her hair, making no move to release her, and no move to indulge his own desires. 



He closed his eyes against his own riotous emotions and physical need, knowing that the last thing Chelsea needed was an assault on her senses when she was this near to breaking. 



In the morning, he made breakfast, which they ate on the balcony while he quizzed her about all she endured this week. 



Chelsea poured her heart out, feeling truly heard, seen, valued, and cared for. The feeling was entirely foreign to her; exhilarating and terrifying all at once.



She broke down and related her first encounter with a tornado. She had heard many descriptions before, but nothing compared. 



She explained to Pete, ‚ÄúI ordered the cab to stop and let me out. He gunned it instead. I screamed at him to stop. A brief fight ensued, with the driver calling me a *crazy lady,* she ground out, ‚Äúand finally, he slammed the brakes and let me out. I leaped from the taxi to film the beast, thinking, *My God! It‚Äôs roiling, rotating, living evil, hellbent on death and destruction.* I‚Äôve never encountered anything like it in my life!‚Äù



She paused to stab an orange slice, and continued, ‚ÄúI wanted to get the best video I could, but mostly I wanted to run screaming. It‚Äôs the most terrifying encounter I have ever had.‚Äù



She paused for a sip of coffee, struggling to get past the lump in her throat, and said, ‚ÄúI focused the camera with my hands shaking violently, but I had a job to do. I quieted my grip on the camera, but misjudged distance and speed.‚Äù



Again she paused, lost in reliving the terror of the memory. Then gathered her wits about her and began again.



‚ÄúWhen I looked up, it was nearly on top of me. I ran for the nearest building and took shelter with others caught in the storm. We huddled together in a far corner of the cellar, holding hands, praying, listening to the beast scream its rage, and shake the walls. *That‚Äôs the closest I ever want to get to a real-life monster.*‚Äù Chelsea broke down, weeping into her trembling hands.



‚Äú*Holy nightmare, Chelsea! Don‚Äôt you ever risk that again*,‚Äù he ordered, panic stricken, and closing the gap. He hauled her up, full length against him, saying, ‚Äú*Just promise me. I know you‚Äôre out to prove yourself, but that doesn‚Äôt mean getting yourself killed!*‚Äù



Chelsea didn‚Äôt fight him. She curled into the safety he afforded her, whispering, ‚ÄúI promise, Pete. Honest. I‚Äôll get a telephoto lens, so I won‚Äôt have to get that close next time.‚Äù



He tried to release her just long enough to look into her eyes, but he couldn‚Äôt do it. The harrowing tale of nearly losing her made him lock her into his embrace. 



After a long moment, he scolded her, issuing, ‚ÄúWe need to have a serious discussion about where your commitment to excellent ends, and your commitment to saving your own skin begins.‚Äù



Pete knew exactly what she needed. He had been without safety and succor, often enough that he knew exactly how to show up for her, even though he couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of there being a *next time.*



Chelsea had never received a gift of this magnitude before. It was her own, personal miracle, and she suddenly realized that she loved him; *head over, to the depths of my soul, no turning back, love,* she realized, stupefied.



‚ÄúI was planning to wait for a more appropriate time to ask you this,‚Äù Pete whispered, ‚Äúbut it won't wait now. You need a stabilizing force in your life, and I need you in mine.‚Äù 



He stopped, tilting her chin up to lock eyes with her, ‚ÄúMarry me, Chelsea. I know it's sudden, but I‚Äôll be the best decision you‚Äôve ever made. Give me a chance, love. Marry me,‚Äù he finished, locking eyes with her. He held her gaze silently, willing her to say the answer he wanted.



Chelsea pulled away slightly, taking both his hands in her own, and then smiled up at him, asking, ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù 



Pete heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled brightly, genuinely happy and excited, he replying, ‚ÄúTomorrow looks like a Chelsea morning. We can make the arrangements today. Yes?‚Äù 



With her eyes now smoldering with desire, she tugged him toward the bedroom, answering, ‚ÄúYes, my love. Yes, now let's go celebrate.‚Äù

Aside from her strange back, Amy recently started having nightmares, mostly about being afraid of something behind her as she's walking alone in her dark house or down the street, but everytime she turns around, there's nothing there, and the feeling of something directly behind her remains no matter how many times she turns around.

It was only when she started experiencing this while awake that she began to truly become paranoid. 

And then she had a nightmare about this woman that was missing skin from her back. The woman was about the same age as Amy, and looked nearly identical to her, but this woman seemed unnatural and wrong in some way. Amy still couldn't shake the woman's voice from her head, couldn't forget the way that woman said ""Do you still have my back?"". Amy oddly remembered the woman's name being Emily, somehow, and she couldn't describe it, but she felt as though she knew this woman...

Amy could hardly sleep anymore, and her adoptive mother Sara was becoming very concerned for her daughter.

""Amy, what's wrong, sweetheart?"" Sara asked, sitting down on the couch in her living room. ""You're working yourself to death, honey. You look like you haven't slept in weeks.""

""I've been having nightmares."" Amy says, taking a sip of the tea her dear mother had made for her. ""It's making it really hard to sleep.""

""Oh, no. What are the nightmares about?""

""At first, it would just be this feeling of someone standing behind me, but when I turned around, it was like they were still behind me somewhere. Then, I started feeling that when I was awake. I was in court one day, and I swore I heard someone calling my name from right behind me, but there was no one there. Then last night, I had a nightmare about a woman who looked just like me, but...but the skin, on her back, it was... missing."" Amy haltingly admits, her breathing shaky. 

""You saw a woman with no skin on her back?"" Sara asks, her voice barely above a whisper. Amy could only nod. ""There's something I never told you. It happened before we adopted you, the adoption agency said you would have limited memory of it...""

""What are you talking about, Mom?"" Amy asks, confused and worried.

""The reason your birth mother gave you up was... You were born with a conjoined twin."" Sara says, looking at her daughter whose eyes were so wide you could drive a truck through them.

""What?"" Amy says in shock.

""You and your twin were conjoined at the back. You could only look at each other in mirrors, and you had a lot of difficulty walking on your own, so once you were both old and strong enough, the doctors at the orphanage decided to have you two separated. But...it didn't go very well."" Sara says, her voice wavering.

""What does that mean?""

""When they tried to separate you two, your sister was less than happy about it."" Sara says. ""They said she started fighting them, and they had to give her a much larger than normal dose of sedation just so they could separate you from her, and during the procedure, they made a mistake that led to her skin being left mostly on your back."" 

Amy gasped in horror. Suddenly her paranoia and nightmares made sense. She was feeling the phantom sensation from when her twin used to be attached to her back.

Suddenly Amy fell over unconscious from sheer exhaustion. Her mother grabbed the phone and dialed 911.

A few hours later, Amy woke in a hospital room, drugged and disoriented.

""What's happening?"" Amy says weakly, trying to sit up only to have a doctor lay her back down. 

""Be careful. You have a concussion. You hit your head on the coffee table when lost consciousness."" Dr Gordon says, checking the small wound on her head.

A few hours later, as Amy stood in the hospital bathroom later that night, she saw the back of someone's head behind her shoulder in the mirror. A hand raised a old-fashioned handheld mirror up behind her head, and Amy saw...

Emily.

""Hi, Amy."" Emily said behind her.

""Emily?"" Amy says in shock.

""Did you miss me?"" Emily says sweetly, making Amy laugh and sob at the same time.
""I'll always have your back, sis.""

""And I'll always have yours."" Amy says, tears streaming down her face.


In the bathroom in a hospital all the way on the opposite coast, Emily stood with her back to the vanity mirror, holding a handheld mirror up to he reflection.

""I'll always have your back, sis.""

""And I'll always have yours."" Amy's voice said back, making the tears spring to Emily's eyes. 


One day, Emily would be with her sister again...

One. Sweet. Day.


-


Four months later, Emily and Amy made travel arrangements to meet for the first time in years. 

As Amy and Emily hugged in the airport, she felt as though she had found the missing piece of herself. The two went out for lunch and coffee at Amy's favorite cafe, then they went back to Amy's apartment, where Emily unpacked her bags in the guest room. 

Later that night, Amy woke up to feel someone laying behind her. She looked over her shoulder, seeing Emily laying back to back with her. 

""Emily? What are you doing?"" Amy asks groggily.

""Oh, sorry."" Emily says quietly. ""I must have been sleepwalking again."" 

Emily stood up to head back to her room, leaning down and pressing a kiss to Amy's head. 

""Goodnight, my dear, sweet sister."" Emily says, grinning like a lunatic before heading back to her room. 

The next day, Amy awoke at 7:30 in the morning to hear Emily's alarm going off in the next room. She got up with an exhausted groan, heading into the room to shut it off. She could hear the shower running in the guest bathroom, and supposed Emily must have hit snooze accidentally. It was something Amy had done before as well. 

Amy was about to leave when she noticed something odd. Two identical barbie dolls that had been melted together at the back. As Amy looked through more of what she assumed were Emily's old toys, she found two teddy bears sewed together, and then a mutilated Barbie doll that looked like it had been ripped from another one after being fused to it. 

""Can't you see her pain?"" Emily says suddenly, standing in the doorway. Her hair was soaking wet and she was wearing a ratty white bathrobe. ""She's in pain, because she's missing something."" 

""What's she missing?"" Amy asked timidly.

""Her other half."" Emily responds, holding a big sewing needle in her hand. ""Her sweet, dear sister..."" 

Amy tried to bolt for the door, only for Emily to grab her hair and smash her head against the wall. 

Amy came to several hours later sat crosslegged on a couch. She tried to move only to feel a searing pain in her back. She screamed in agony, terrified. 

""What did you do to me?!"" Amy shrieked. 

""It's better this way, Amy. You'll see that soon!"" Emily says sweetly, sighing contentedly as she rests her head against Amy's shoulder. 

Amy continued to scream as she realized...

So‚Äîwhere do folks in Manipur find dates or even just cool people to talk to? Is there an app that works here? Or is it more of a ‚Äúyou just bump into someone at a cafe and the universe does the rest‚Äù kinda deal? üëÄ

1lc9b2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Future-Profession115/comments/1lc9b2m/she_came_with_the_storm/,She Came with the Storm,"It started on a Tuesday.

The rain had come in heavy, late, uninvited. I remember it because the forecast had said clear skies, and I'd left the windows cracked. The house smelled like wet leaves and dust. I was halfway through a movie I wasn't really watching when the knock came.

Three slow taps.

Not urgent, not uncertain. Just... deliberate.

I waited, unsure I‚Äôd heard anything at all. Then it came again.

I opened the door, and there she was.

Soaked to the bone. Hair clinging to her face. A long, dark coat draped over her shoulders, buttoned crooked. She looked at me like she‚Äôd been here before.

‚ÄúI'm not lost,‚Äù she said.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say to that, so I stepped aside.

She walked in like it wasn‚Äôt the first time.

No introduction. No questions. She looked around the living room like checking to see what had changed. Her gaze paused on the crooked lamp near the couch, then moved on. I half-expected her to comment on it, but she didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúWould you like a towel?‚Äù I offered.

She nodded once. ‚ÄúThat would be nice.‚Äù

I brought her one from the hallway closet. She took it without a word, rubbed it over her hair, her face. She didn‚Äôt seem in a hurry. Everything she did was deliberate, like she'd done it before, maybe a thousand times.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt usually open the door this late,‚Äù I said, because silence made the room feel smaller.

She smiled faintly. ‚ÄúI only ever knock when it rains.‚Äù

There was no inflection to her voice‚Äîlike it was a fact, not a joke.

She didn‚Äôt say much after that. Just sat on the couch, pulled the blanket over her legs. She stared out the window like something might come back through it.

I made coffee. She declined.

She didn‚Äôt ask to stay, but she didn‚Äôt leave either. Around midnight, she lay over on the couch, curled beneath the blanket, and closed her eyes. I watched her breathing slow. No words. No goodnight.

I busied myself. Picked up a book I wasn‚Äôt reading. Pretended to clean something in the kitchen. But always, I kept her in my view‚Äîquietly, like you'd watch the last minutes of a dream.

When I finally turned in, I left the hallway light on.

In the morning, she was gone.

The blanket folded. The door locked behind her. No footprints, no wet towel. Just a faint dampness in the air, like she‚Äôd taken the rain with her.


---

I didn‚Äôt expect to see her again.

After the first night, I chalked it up to something strange and passing‚Äîlike fog in the wrong place, or a story you wake up from without remembering the plot. I even looked her up online, though I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was looking for. Missing persons. Break-ins. Ghost stories. Nothing turned up.

Days passed. A week. Then another. The rain came and went, and with it, the edge of that night began to dull.

Until the second storm.

It came in harder than the first‚Äîlate evening thunder and sideways wind, the kind of storm that grabs your attention. I was in the kitchen when I heard the knock. I froze.

Same rhythm. Same time. Just like before.

I already knew it would be her.

When I opened the door, she was there again‚Äîdark brown hair heavy with rain, coat sagging around her frame. This time, she didn‚Äôt ask. Just looked at me with wide, exhausted eyes.

I stepped aside. She walked in.

Something in the way she moved felt different. She looked around, just like before, but this time there was less searching in it‚Äîmore recognition. Like she‚Äôd dreamed this room and wanted to see if it was still the same.

She reached out and touched the lamp with the crooked shade. Ran a hand along the edge of the coffee table. Her fingertips caught on a scratch near the corner, and she paused there, staring like it meant something she couldn‚Äôt quite remember.

""You‚Äôve been here before,"" I said.

She nodded. ‚ÄúI thought I might have. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond, but she sat down in the same spot on the couch and pulled the blanket into her lap without asking.

I brought her tea this time. She didn‚Äôt drink it, just cupped her hands around the mug like she needed the warmth more than the flavor. Her coat steamed faintly in the lamplight.

""You said you weren‚Äôt lost,"" I said, careful not to crowd her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù she said, eyes on the window. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm supposed to be.‚Äù

The wind shook the glass, and she flinched‚Äîjust barely.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve been living the same day over and over,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúEverything resets. Same coffee. Same people. Same sky. It‚Äôs like being stuck inside a mirror.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTime feels thin.‚Äù

She set the tea down, untouched.

‚ÄúBut when it rains‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off. Her eyes met mine. ‚ÄúI end up here.‚Äù

""Why?""

She smiled softly, but it wasn‚Äôt a happy smile. ‚ÄúI was hoping you‚Äôd know.‚Äù

I sat across from her, trying to make sense of it‚Äînot in the logical way, but in the way your body feels something before your brain catches up. There was a strange kind of peace in her presence, even with the confusion. Like a song you‚Äôd only heard in pieces, playing just enough to haunt you.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked after a while.

She didn‚Äôt answer at first. Then, quietly: ‚ÄúOphelia.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that your real name?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

She tucked her knees under the blanket and leaned against the arm of the couch. The thunder cracked again, farther off this time. The storm was already starting to pull away.

We didn‚Äôt talk much after that. I stayed in the chair and she curled up smaller, her eyes fluttering like she was fighting sleep. Eventually, she gave in.

I stayed there a while, watching the fire die low. She looked so still‚Äîlike she could sleep through anything. Like she had waited too long to be tired.

I didn‚Äôt go to bed right away, but I didn‚Äôt want to leave her alone either. So I stayed in the chair until my neck ached and the storm faded to drizzle. Then I covered her with the blanket and left the light on low.

By morning, she was gone again.

The mug was empty. The coat gone. The front door shut but not locked.

And in the quiet, I missed her more than I should‚Äôve.


---

It had been nearly a month since the last time.

The rain had come and gone a dozen times since then. Some storms passed without so much as a flicker of memory. Others made me pace by the front door like a dog waiting for its owner. I didn‚Äôt always realize I was doing it‚Äîchecking the porch light, glancing at the clock, pretending I wasn‚Äôt listening for footsteps.

She didn‚Äôt come.

I told myself she was a dream. That I had filled in the blanks of something strange with loneliness and old paperback stories. That it made sense to forget her voice, to question the way her fingers traced the fabric of the couch like she‚Äôd done it before. Dreams do that. They erase themselves kindly.

Still, I left the porch light on when it rained.

The third storm came just after midnight‚Äîno warning, no buildup. The sky just cracked open and spilled. Thunder rolled in slow, heavy pulses. I was lying on the couch this time, not reading, not doing much of anything. The rain on the windows was all there was.

Then came the knock.

Not rushed. Not panicked. Just‚Ä¶ late.

I stood too fast. My foot hit the coffee table, and I barely felt it.

When I opened the door, she was there.

But this time, she looked different.

Not just wet‚Äîwrong. Her skin was pale, like something drained. Her dress clung to her, soaked to transparency. Her lips were parted like she‚Äôd been running, or crying. She didn‚Äôt say anything. Just looked up at me, eyes wide and hollow.

‚ÄúI almost didn‚Äôt make it this time,‚Äù she said.

I stepped aside. She stumbled in.

I caught her elbow‚Äînot forceful, just enough to keep her from collapsing. She let me touch her. That was new. Her arm was cold and trembling under my hand.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre freezing,‚Äù I said.

She nodded, too tired to lie.

I wrapped her in a towel, brought her to the couch. She curled into the blanket like she was trying to disappear.

I made tea again. She didn‚Äôt touch it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù she said. Her voice was quieter than before, less sure. ‚ÄúThe loop‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not holding. I think something‚Äôs tearing.‚Äù

I sat beside her, not too close, but closer than last time.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was in the middle of dinner,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúTalking to someone I‚Äôve talked to a hundred times. And then it stopped. Mid-sentence. Just froze. Like the world forgot how to move.‚Äù

She looked down at her hands.

‚ÄúThen everything peeled away. Like paper burning from the edges in. And then I was outside your door.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure that matters,‚Äù she said, without looking at me.

After a while, she asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúMatt,‚Äù I said.

She smiled faintly. ‚ÄúMatt.‚Äù Then repeated it like she was trying to pin it to something that kept slipping.

I reached out and tucked a damp strand of dark brown hair behind her ear. She didn‚Äôt flinch. She closed her eyes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I was supposed to meet you,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúBut you did.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúThree times. And I remember all of them. That‚Äôs never happened before.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said the loop is tearing,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat is 'the loop', and what happens if it breaks completely?‚Äù

She looked at me for a long time.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôm supposed to disappear.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I was supposed to die,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúBut you weren‚Äôt there, so I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say to that. I wasn't sure that I wanted to know what it meant.

She leaned into me. My hand found her back, uncertain at first, then steady. She breathed slowly‚Äîdeep, measured. Like the weight of her body in that moment was the only real thing.

Then she kissed me.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden. It wasn‚Äôt hungry. Just quiet.

Her lips were soft and cool, but the kiss warmed as it deepened. She moved closer, climbed into my lap. Her arms looped around my neck. The way we fit together felt ancient. Familiar. Like gravity had been trying to pull us together for years and finally got the timing right.

We didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt rush.

Clothes fell away in pieces. Nothing planned. No seduction. Just‚Ä¶ belonging.

I carried her to the bedroom.

We made love with the storm as our witness.

It was soft. Real. No fantasy. Just skin and breath and the quiet understanding that this wouldn‚Äôt last. That it couldn‚Äôt.

After, we lay tangled in the sheets. Her hand on my chest. My fingers in her hair.

‚ÄúI wish this was the last time,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúThen stay.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer. Just closed her eyes and exhaled against my skin.

We fell asleep like that.

I dreamed of her in different places. Running through a field at dusk. Always just out of reach. Always turning back to look at me.

And then morning came.

I woke to sunlight.

The bed beside me was cold.

She was gone.


---

It hasn‚Äôt rained in a long time.

The weather‚Äôs been dry, day after day. Even the air feels reluctant now, like it‚Äôs holding something in. I find myself checking the sky without meaning to. Listening for thunder that doesn‚Äôt come. Watching the clouds for patterns I no longer understand.

She‚Äôs been gone for twenty-six days.

I know, because I mark them. A pencil line for each morning she doesn‚Äôt return. There‚Äôs a drawer in my kitchen where her tea mug still sits. I haven‚Äôt used it. Can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to.

Sometimes I wonder if she found a way out. If breaking the loop meant becoming something else‚Äîlighter, quieter, farther away.

Sometimes I think I was the loop.

Other times, I convince myself none of it happened.

But then, once in a while, when the wind picks up just right, the trees outside the bedroom window shift in a way that makes me pause. And for a second‚Äîjust a second‚ÄîI think I feel her in the room again.

I leave the porch light on.

I have recently had a date with a girl that I really liked. We met online and went for a coffee and the conversation went pretty smoothly. We shared about our university life, family life, hobbies, plans for the future and it seemed pretty much aligned. We hugged when we met and after the date.

Later she texted me she really enjoyed the date and I said I did too and I¬¥d love to go out again to which she agreed but next week she is busy. So after a few weeks of silence I texted her again asking what¬¥s up and she told me she didn¬¥d really feel the Vibe/chemistry and she doesn¬¥t want anything romantically. She also mentioned how she really enjoyed the date as well as meeting me.

Now that is something that has happened to me a couple of times, where the girls told me they didn¬¥t feel the ""chemistry"". I understand there should be some sort of physical contact so on the first date I go for hugs before and after but I also need to get to know the person before I initiate more.  
It¬¥s something I don¬¥t really understand. I don¬¥t expect the date to blow me away on the first date, I expect the attraction to come gradually...

I get very discouraged and start feeling like something¬¥s wrong with me..

1lc95kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1lc95kj/a_practical_way_to_deal_with_being_ghosted/,A practical way to deal with being ghosted,"Earlier this year, I was ghosted by a guy I used to trust a lot, someone I used to be emotionally close with for more than one and half years. The whole process is truly painful for me. Here I am sharing several practical ways that have helped me gain more control over this situation. I hope it could be of some help for you too.¬†

**Step 1: Reconnect with yourself by feeling your beating hearts.**

* This helped me to gain the attention back onto myself instead of asking ‚Äúwhy is he doing this?‚Äù Feeling my heartbeats made me realize I am a kind and honest person who needs to be well taken care of as well.¬†
* I suggest you feel your beating heart by putting your hands close to your heart after following this meditation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLeqY9ingRY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLeqY9ingRY) or similar guided meditation videos that help you focus on the present.¬†

**Step 2: Write down a list of the** **fundamental and critical qualifications your partner should meet. Check if the ghoster checks all boxes.**

* This is a method I learned from an online Meetup event held by Natalie. You can find all events she holds at here https://www.meetup.com/members/403054540/.
* For example, my list for my future partner includes: consistency; courage and curiosity to explore the external and inner worlds; open and honest communication.¬†

**Step 3: Be aware that people are different with different experiences, perceptions, and even different physical brain structures.**¬†

* I tell myself don‚Äôt try to figure out the deep motivation or reasons behind his ghosting because it‚Äôs strongly likely that he doesn't even have the courage to face and know himself. Even if I go back to him and beg for reconnection, there is a high chance that he won‚Äôt change, and at the same time, I might be changed by him. Then, I asked myself ‚Äúbut my dearest \[my name\], do you really want to become a person like him in this aspect?‚Äù
* Below are two scientific papers that convince me to let go of the thought of trying to decipher his mixed signals and behaviors.
   * The Neuroscience of Reality by Anil K. Seth
      * [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neuroscience-of-reality/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neuroscience-of-reality/)
   * The Neurobiology of Attachment to Nurturing and Abusive Caregivers by Regina M. Sullivan (highly recommend this one!!)
      * [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3774302/pdf/nihms461646.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3774302/pdf/nihms461646.pdf)

**Step 4: the Classification method**¬†

Even after all of the previous steps,¬† I noticed that I can still have a massive amount of intrusive thoughts of him everyday and it interferes with my work and study. So I invented this method for myself and let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúClassification‚Äù! Basically, I categorize those thoughts into three types - memory, chemical and speculation.¬†

* *Memory*: your shared loving and heartbroken memories, and we should know both of them are in the past that we cannot go back or reconstruct which means it is a waste of time to think about.¬†
* *Chemical*: sometimes even just thinking about him without any specific scenes in my head made me sad and tearful. They are purely emotions that I couldn‚Äôt even identify a trigger for. These are emotions that are generated by brain chemicals or neurotransmitters that are beyond our cognitive control. Knowing that we have no control over them enables us to take control. We just need to identify them.¬†
* *Speculation*: I think about ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù a lot. I think about us getting back in touch. I think about explanations and interpretations behind his behaviors. But these are all my imagination, inferences and hopes without solid reality checks and evidence.There is no guarantee that my speculations are true. Putting time and energy into this speculation is like sticking around a question that has no answer. Let‚Äôs let go of them.¬†

Now we are ready for the classification part: every time when those intrusive thoughts come into our mind, instead of being stuck into it, we categorize it. *Below are examples of my thought process in this classification process:*

* Example 1:
   * My thoughts: ‚ÄúWe called last June and he said our relationship was important for him.‚Äù
   * My inner voice: (quickly categorize it, then say it aloud in my head) ‚ÄúObjection! Memory!‚Äù
   * Thoughts stop here.
* Example 2:
   * My thoughts: ‚ÄúWhat if I had reached out to him earlier before the Christmas holiday started? We might have met in New York, and we might clear things out.‚Äù
   * My inner voice: (quickly categorize it, then say it aloud in my head) ‚ÄúObjection! Speculation!‚Äù
   * Thoughts stop here.
* Example 3:
   * My thoughts: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why but I just feel so sad and I miss him a lot.‚Äù
   * My inner voice: (quickly categorize it, then say it aloud in my head) ‚ÄúObjection! Chemical!‚Äù
   * Thoughts stop here.

By doing this, I am able to end the intrusive thoughts immediately and prevent further mental traps. In the beginning I noticed that I said ‚ÄúObjections!‚Äù probably 3 times within as short as 5 minutes, but after several days of conscious practice,¬† it reduced to 3 times a day!

**Step 5: Check my serotonin and dopamine. Open my eyes to my surroundings. Love should be easy.**¬†¬†

* There are days that I notice I don‚Äôt even have the energy for the Classification method. I consciously build up my serotonin and dopamine levels by taking a walk in the early morning, having a cup of coffee after that, eating healthy, talking with friends during lunch time, playing the piano and watching people in the city center.¬†

**Final remarks:**

Honestly, I am still thinking about him after three months of being ghosted, but not to a degree that interferes with my normal life, I can stay super productive at work and study. I tell myself I don‚Äôt need to hate him to move on. I don‚Äôt need to understand him to move on. I don‚Äôt need closure from him to move on.¬†

***I admit he still has a special place in my heart, and I‚Äôm still willing and happy to accept him and grow together with him but ONLY IF he apologizes and shows he has grown into someone who ticks off all boxes on the list in Step 2 :)***

***Walking out the heavy shadow of being ghosted is hard and it takes time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself if the process is slow, but also be aware that it depends on our conscious choices.***

1lc94op,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1lc94op/nightmare_neighbor_poisoned_creek_stole_water/,"Nightmare Neighbor poisoned creek, stole water, then assaulted me","This is my post from neighborsfromhell. I started reading posts after posting, then that led me to listening to this channel. If you read it through, it‚Äôs worth it. CN is insane.

I just created this account because my friend suggested I post here and maybe get some advice too. I don't know how to format for reddit, but he said to make sure that I did.

I live on a large property with a small house in the front. There are many small hot springs in the semi-rural mountain area that I live in, with many used by homeowners in their backyard. Many are piped indoors, but some have hot tubs built around them. I happen to have a active one in my backyard (picture an in-ground hot tub being fed in from the hot spring) near my left neighbors house (I'll call her CN for crazy neighbor). A small stream runs through the far backyards of the neighborhood and it used for gardens and little nature areas that everyone on the street enjoys. I have my small fruit/pepper garden watered by this stream and take really good care of it. For some visualization, it has a good amount of water flowing down and everyone on the street uses it some way. My right neighbor (who's a really chill dude, who I'll call Jay) has small pools he made that are fed by the stream, and two neighbors down has a garden similar to mine. Now on to the actual story.

  
When I bought the house, the previous owners were sued by CN, her claiming that the land was rightfully hers. I don't know the details of her argument, but it was thrown out (as far as I know). The previous owners warned me of CN and not to engage with her family. When I moved in, CN's kids (I'd say probably 8, 9, and 10) brought over cookies and welcomed me to the neighborhood. I thought that the previous owner was exaggerating as they seemed sweet. I invited CN and her family to a small BBQ and they accepted. The second that they got in the house, CN started to explain the 'rules of the neighborhood'.  I thought it was pretty normal (like to not play loud music after 9, keep your car in the driveway to keep the street uncluttered, etc. Common sense rules) until she got to some rules reguarding the stream and the hot springs. 

  
She said that kids were allowed in all parts of the stream (in private backyards) and that everyone could use eachother's hot springs (I have the only hot spring on the street, so I was surprised by that). I interrupted her and told her that I wasn't comfortable with those, and she scoffed, saying that all neighbors were fine with it. I told her that I still wasn't comfortable with it. She ignored me, continuing with some questionable rules. The rest of the night was fine, but I felt like I wouldn't want to do it again. 

  
I talked to some neighbors across the next couple days, who all told me to steer clear of CN and that her rules were BS. I went over to CN's house and told her that I had talked to the other neighbors and that I wasn't comfortable with anyone being in my backyard without my permission. She scoffed and said ok. I had a lunch with Jay and he told me who CN was: A serial suer with her lawyer on speed dial to get whatever she wants. CN had sued a small chain pizza place in town into debt for having peanut oil on her pizza when she was allergic to it. The pizza chain didn't even have peanut oil (and many people in the small community believed that she put it on), but still lost everything. I decided not to ever talk to her or her family.

  
A week later, I got home from the grocery store to see CN's kids (I'll call them EKs for entitled kids) splashing in my hot spring tub (its outside and usually has a lid on that two small kids would definitely not be able to take off as it is heavy and large). I tell them that they're not allowed in it and to leave my yard immediately, and they stand their ground, telling me that their mom (CN) told them that it was theirs and that they could use it. I told them that that's not true and to leave now. They finally do. Before you think that I'm an asshole for that, remember that pools/hot tubs are dangerous and I don't want to be liable. I headed back out to buy locks for my gates. When I got back, CN was now there, demanding why I kicked her kids out. She reminded me of the ""rules"", but I told her to leave immediately and that my security camera was recording. She cursed at me for a min or two, then left. I was bluffing as I did not have security cameras, but I did order them on amazon that night. The next day was fine, replanting a lot of my plants from my apartment's balcony into the empty garden (the one that's watered by the stream). I noticed that CN kept looking over the fence.

  
For the following weeks, CN complained about the trees in my yard, the color of the fence, what I'm doing with the stream, etc. Jay occasionally came over and told her to f off. Three weeks ago, I left for a couple days for a friend's wedding. I kept getting security alerts saying that there was motion in my backyard, often her kids playing in my garden (trampling my dear shishito peppers). I texted Jay to tell them to get out. If you're wondering why not call the police, they wouldn't do anything as they're just some kids. I had a suspicion that CN was telling them to do these things, but I didn't have much evidence.

  
On the drive back, I got a security alert that there was motion in my backyard. I didn't check as I was driving, but when I stopped for gas, I checked and saw CN instructing a plumbing team installing piping from MY hotspring into THEIR yard. I had it save all of the footage and I sent messages to Jay about it. Jay told them that they weren't allowed to be doing that, but since it wasn't his house, they didn't listen to him. I called the police and they went, but they had already installed the piping. The team was just leaving through the gate (with a broken lock on the ground), when the police showed up. They said that they had been hired by the homeowner. The police waited for me to get there while talking to the team of workers, and I told them that I was the homeowner and that I hadn't payed them to do it. They looked confused. I went with the police into the backyard and I started ripping the unsecured piping out with a crowbar. 

  
CN starts shrieking from her yard and puts her head over the fence and starts yelling that I'm destroying private property and that she would sue me. CN then says that she has a contract with the owner of the house to have their (my) hot spring water. The police are now confused. She shows a contract that read that  she was paying me $2 per month in exchange for the water. CN won't give it to me so I could look at it besides waving it around in the air. The police eventually leave and warn me not to destroy the piping. I ripped up the small pipe that connects to the source as she's telling me that she'll see me in court. I contacted my lawyer and she said that CN had no case as she didn't know my signature and it would be easy to prove it was forged. I still haven't been served by CN's lawyer, but know that I will soon. In the meantime, I've been sitting in the hot tub for long baths while talking to myself loudly about how much I love it. Petty, but it made me feel good hearing the growls from across the fence.

  
This is the final thing that made me post here, my garden wilting and dying at an unnatural rate. I heard a commotion out in CN's yard and I peeked over and saw her slowly pouring a massive jug of chemicals into the communal stream, which goes down to mine. I don't know if its herbicides, plant killer, or something like bleach (it doesn't smell like bleach so I don't think its that), but its rapidly killing my plants. I haven't eaten any of the fruit/peppers since as I'm worried I might get sick. I think that if I can get definitive proof of her doing it, I can maybe use it in court to prove how crazy she is. People swim in pools from the stream, so I warned Jay not too for the time being and told him to tell others. I know one neighbor removed her garden from the soil and moved it away from the stream just in case it got down to hers.

  
I'm unsure of what I should do next. I don't think I live in a two party consent state for video recording as it doesn't list it as one on the pdf I found. I might crosspost this into legal advice just in case (I do already have a lawyer, but it might be useful hearing free opinions from the internet).

Edit: I forgot to say that I had water testing sticks arriving tomorrow.

TLDR: Crazy neighbor steals hot spring water and pours chemicals into communal stream, poisoning my garden

Update 1: Jay offered to use a large drum in his garage to temporarily remove the water from the stream and seeing your comments, I‚Äôm taking him up on his deal. All the neighbors down the street that I‚Äôve talked to so far (two besides Jay) agreed. One who has two sons said that they might block off the start of the stream. It is a small outlet of a moderately sized creek. It will probably be blocked off not that hard. Jay said that he can probably get the drum in place by tonight as his dad can help. Jay also has a sweet dog and definitely wants to protect it. I am going to remove my plants from the soil nearby the stream. Also, for reference in size of the stream, it‚Äôs about 1-2 feet across. Truly just a stream. There‚Äôs lots of obstacles and things that would probably filter out, but we definitely still have to be safe. I‚Äôll update later tonight or tomorrow.

Update 2: Big news! The nice neighbors‚Äô kids dammed up the stream at where it starts. It‚Äôs a couple pieces of wood, a branch or two, and a lot of small rocks. There‚Äôs still a tiny bit of water flowing, but it‚Äôs absorbed by the soil higher up before CN. Jay got the drum out, but we turned out not to need it. There‚Äôs water still in the pools in his backyard and we plan to do a water test. Apparently pH tests are sold in a store just 10 mins away, so I will head there as soon as I finish this post.

Update 3: Jays getting the pH test and an oxygen level test, but I don‚Äôt know how oxygen levels would play into it. I‚Äôll look at responses and figure out what to do next. I will call authorities soon.

Update 4: The water test: pH came lower than the creek water before CN‚Äôs house (a full .9 lower). Nitrates a bit higher, Dissolved Oxygen significantly lower. That‚Äôs the only real changes in between the two tests. I wonder if she just poured a lot of vinegar. I think herbicides do change pH, but .9 is quite a bit I think.

Update 5: Big update! The makeshift dam broke and water has been flowing down, but it‚Äôs been slow. CN complained to a neighbor up the street that she‚Äôs on speaking terms with about me being a major asshole for not letting her kids use my hot spring tub. She let it slip that she poured household vinegar in the stream as ‚Äújustice‚Äù. The neighbor was also shown the contract for the pipes and she said that she didn‚Äôt even have it signed by me. She and her lawyer had signed it, but without any signature space for me. I thought that she forged my signature, but she didn‚Äôt have any agreement (fraudulent or otherwise) on my side whatsoever. The neighbor similarly dislikes her, but their kids are friends, so she has to talk to CN. I sent all the info to a local environmental charity that has contacts within environmental protection agencies. They usually deal with lakes and dumping, so this was in what they deal with regularly. 

The police were outside CN‚Äôs house a couple hours ago and took her to the station. CN is back at her house, now yelling over the fence profanities while I‚Äôm having a coffee. I don‚Äôt know if they arrested her and she payed bail or that she just was taken in for questioning or something. I know her brother in law works at the police station, but I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that her family members have a strained relationship with her. I hope that she‚Äôs stuck with a giant fine and/or jail time. CN‚Äôs lawyer still hasn‚Äôt served me regarding the pipes, and my lawyer is saying that CN has no case whatsoever. I‚Äôll update as soon as anything interesting comes up.

Update 6: My power just went out in most of my house. I think CN just flipped the breakers to annoy me. Going outside ASAP

Update 7: CN indeed did flip the breakers. As far as I know, the security camera has an internal battery for some time after it‚Äôs disconnected from the power so I don‚Äôt have to worry about her doing anything.

Revenge Discussion Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1kk45k1/updatediscussion_revenge_tactics/

Update 8: I called the owner of the copy/print/delivery shop and he agreed to what I said in the previous post. I removed all of the pipes from my yard and put them into bags. I didn‚Äôt have as much plastic bags and boxes as I thought so I‚Äôm paying extra for the owner of the copy shop to supply them. He just delivered the first one to CN (I watched from the street) and CN‚Äôs husband answered. He shouted for CN and she came up. I didn‚Äôt hear any of the discussion, but she signed delivery sheet, took the package (of a single small corner pipe piece), and stormed into her house. She went up to the 2nd story window and proceeded to glare at me since, still glaring as I sit on my couch while writing this. Working from home will be so nice for watching this.

Update 9: Since my last post, there has been one more pipe delivery to CN and she is pissed. She stormed over to my house (after signing the delivery which I thought she would stop doing) and banged on the door. I started recording my front door and opened the door (I'm not dumb enough to let her in). CN starts shrieking about how I'm awful and that I had to keep the pipes installed as it was her property and that we had a contract. When I told her that the contract wasn't legal at all, she starts screaming at me. I stepped inside for a second and called the police with the door closed. CN continues banging on my door. I don't open until a police car comes down the street.

I tell the police that I don't want her ever to be on my property and that she is tresspassing. They relay that to her, and she takes up a hurt old lady act (for reference, she is in her 40s). CN tells them that my hot tub burned her youngest child and that I was luring kids in. I showed the police the camera footage and they asked her to come to the station with them. I'm assuming that she made some fake report, but I guess that will be another charge of lying to a police officer. I think that the officer (not CN's brother in law) believed me and saw that she was in fact a CN.

I saw CN get back into her house and once again went up to the top window, staring. I closed the blinds. I thought she would stop (honestly it doesn't bother me), but to my surprise, she crosses the street to the side of the hill (theres a slope on the other side of the street from the houses. There's more houses up the slope) and stares through my front window. I don't have blinds for that one and was about to head to a different room when I see her trip backwards (theres a small ditch for runoff) and land on her butt. CN lets out a ungodly shriek (it wasn't that loud, but I'd like to say it was) as she storms back into her house.

I feel at this point, with all of the stuff from my lawyer, from reddit, and neighbors saying that I am completely in the right and that CN is insane has made this more into entertainment than a scary situation for me. I have multiple locks arriving in a couple days and a new security camera for the side yard. If you have any legal suggestions, please tell me. If there's anything I should be aware of, please tell me.

Update 9: I‚Äôve been told that messing with CN is probably not going to help out legally, especially with a restraining order, so I just told the copy shop owner just to deliver it all at once. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs happened yet, but I‚Äôm fine not being looking when I happens. I will file a restraining order today. I don‚Äôt know how it works, but I hope I can complete it today. No new news from CN except Jay saying that she looked really mad. I know this isn‚Äôt a big update, but it‚Äôs an update on the situation.

Update 10: This happened last night and I was too tired to update after it. CN's husband (I'll call him NH for neighbor husband) knocked on my door last night, alone. CN wasn't there, so I answered it. He then tells me that CN is ""going through some things right now"" and some other stuff. He then asks me if I could ""let sleeping dogs lie. She did some stuff wrong, but she's a really great person"". I told him that I would consider it. I'm not, but I didn't want to be in that conversation. I honestly thought that he would apologize about it, but making excuses like that is so pathetic. According to many of my neighbors, CN's been like this for years. I think he's trying to cover themselves from the bomb they just planted. That's all. New updates probably coming soon.

Update 11: I was typing this out earlier, but it didn‚Äôt save as a draft so I will paraphrase it instead of writing it all out like earlier.

I went out to get my mail and I noticed CN rush out of her house onto her porch to watch me. I take the mail and head inside. Through the endless sea of junk mail, there was a wedding invitation. Nobody I know remotely nearby is getting married and I didn‚Äôt recognize the names or the faces. On the back was a handwritten letter thanking me for volunteering my house for the bachelorette party and inviting me to wedding at a local venue. 

1. Definitely did NOT invite anyone to use my property for a party
2. My backyard isn‚Äôt the biggest for a party
3. I don‚Äôt know who these people are

I took a picture of the front and the back and then went and made a copy of the invitation and cut it to the right size. I then took the copy and walked in front of CN‚Äôs house (in the street). She is looking from the door. I then light the copy on fire (safely). She runs out and starts yelling at me. I am not entirely listening as I had an earbud in my left ear listening to a podcast (I listen to podcasts while doing my routines and hadn‚Äôt bothered to take it out) and at one point, I heard the groom‚Äôs name. Clearly she was behind it (I knew before, this just solidified the fact). I called her husband and told him that I was not hosting the bachelorette party and to leave me alone. He asks which one. I told him the names of the bride and groom. He is audibly surprised. He then tells me that the groom is CN‚Äôs son from a teenage pregnancy (not with him). He then said that he would talk to CN about it, calling it an accident. 

I find the name of the dad of the groom and call him. He sounded super genuinely grateful when I told him who I was. I asked him about CN and he said that she had left the baby with him and when he had sued for child support, the judge said that it was his poor choices that led to the baby and he was responsible for it, without child support. I told him the situation, and he sounded defeated. Apparently, the groom had been quick to forgive his absent mother (CN) and had invited her against the dad‚Äôs wishes. He said that he would tell the groom and the bride about the situation. 

I then had a thought that would be the absolute perfect revenge:
I offered to host the party for free with 2 rules
1. They don‚Äôt damage anything and clean everything up
2. CN is blocked at the door of the wedding despite her invitation
3. My invite to the wedding still stands.

He said he would discuss it with the bride and groom. Even if he says no, it‚Äôs worth a try. 

I just realized I typed it all up in detail despite what I said at the beginning. I will probably get the news in the next couple days.

Update 12: This is just some clarification (it hasn't been brought up, but might as well.
The wedding is happening on the 24th. I'm pretty sure the invite I got was a spare for later as I doubt they sent out invites so last minute. 
CN reached out to the groom when she heard about him getting married. The groom is in his 20s and had never seen his bio mom before (as far as I know).

Update 13: I will call the groom's dad GD and groom and bride G and B

I was looking over some comments just before posting this and realized I don't want to be screwed over, so I am staying back.

Also, GD gave me a call extremely late last night and told me that G wanted to meet his mom (CN) at the wedding. B was supportive, thinking it would be an extremely wholesome wedding. GD said that he would try to find another location for the party, but that it would be hard this late as B had a large bridesmaids group. GD is going to help CN with preparing for the wedding at his son's request, even though he thinks it might be a disaster.

My plants that are near the stream look scorched as if they were in a fire. (I'm talking about the plants that are next and around the stream, not in my garden.

I think the next steps are through legal means and not through petty actions.

I will keep you all updated.

Update 14: CN had been trying to gain access to the hot spring for as long as she's known of it. She had tried lawsuits, land disputes, and other legal and legally dubious means to get it. When she heard of her son becoming married, she thought that she could have a good attempt at gaining access to the hot spring.
CN had initially offered to use her house for a price for the bridesmaids party, but since it didn't have anything good for a party, B had declined. She couldn't find another place though, but still didn't want CN's house. CN had then had the bright idea to tell the B and G that she had had a natural, healing, and amazing hot spring in her yard and B said yes. 
This is when CN tries the whole piping the hot spring to her yard. She obviously doesn't get far into that plan. After I dismantle all the piping, she volunteers my house and backyard for the party.
I think that the stream pollution was lashing out because she was mad before she volunteered my house.
No updates besides what I've pieced together from assorted sources.

Update 15: GD called me about 10 mins ago. I was going to post the update right away, but I was reading some of the comments.
This is what he said, and asked if my offer about hosting the bridesmaids party was still standing (this is heavily paraphrased to be readable, but all the main points and events are there).
GD met up with CN to talk to her about the wedding, mostly setting boundaries. He went to her house (with his phone recording just in case anything happened, knowing the history of CN). 
GD is talking to CN very formally, as much straight facts as possible when he glances through a cracked open door into her bedroom. I don't remember the word he used to describe it (it was a very good way to say it), but kind of out of the corner of your vision when you're avoiding eye contact. GD sees multiple white dresses laying on CN's bed. They are fancy dresses. Not quite wedding dresses, but definitely close. GD can't stop staring at it. He then asks CN about what she's wearing to the wedding, and CN says that she has a couple dresses picked out.
He connects the dots and subtly leaves the conversation, calls B and G and tells them what he saw. He then gives G some of CN's history. B then asks if they can do the house with the hot spring then.
GD tells me that he knows that I don't like CN and that I wouldn't be at the wedding, but that the rest of the deal would stand. I told him sure, but not to let CN know about it, just letting herself think that I got pushed around by him into hosting.
I know that the agencies I contacted about her pouring vinegar into the creek have been investigating, so even though it likely wouldn't, I hope it all falls out on the day of the wedding

Update 16: I‚Äôve been asked for an update. There has not been much crazy neighbor activity over the time that I haven‚Äôt updated. I think she installed a step stool on her side of the fence as she‚Äôs been looking evil eying me whenever I‚Äôm in the hot tub. The weddings coming up next weekend, so I‚Äôm interested in what‚Äôs going to happen. Not much has happened besides that. 

Update 17: Ok, I‚Äôve been told to skinny dip in the hot spring. I‚Äôm not doing that. I am not socially ok enough for my neighbor to see, even if it‚Äôs to get revenge. I do know some people who are.

This happened yesterday around 1, just for reference. I tell some friends who are comfortable in their own bodies that they could hang out in the hot tub and I‚Äôm not going to be there, so they could do whatever. I more asked them to do it after I gave a little bit of backstory of the neighbor. They happily agreed and they came around 1. I left for a nice long lunch when they came and I told them to call me if anything happened. I also turned off the back security camera just to not be weird. Not 30 minutes later do the COPS call me asking if I was ok with the people in my backyard. CN had called the cops for a trespassing (hypocrite) and they had arrived and talked to my friends. They had my number and they called me. I told them that I invited them over and the cops left. I didn‚Äôt get a call this time, but the police were called again for my friends ‚Äúexposing themselves to children‚Äù. The police knew that they were in a private backyard, but still came and pretty much left almost immediately after (it was the same officers I think). That‚Äôs all. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to do anything until the wedding. Thank you for the astounding amounts of comments, it‚Äôs absolutely insane.

Update 18: My neighbor 2 houses down just came up to me and asked if I would allow the stream to be changed in my yard (Jay already said yes). There‚Äôs a landscaping company that‚Äôs going to be installing limestone along the creek for acid neutralization or something like that. My neighbor 2 houses down does have a garden similar to mine and I guess that‚Äôs why. 
Not a big update. I said yes. I hope this can prevent future acid attacks

Update 19: the wedding.

I haven‚Äôt updated in a while even though some stuff is happened just so I could save it for this giant update. I am so shocked by what happened and I guess I should have listened to some advice about being safe. Also, I phrased the update about the card wrong as the bridesmaids party was last night and the wedding is today (the ceremony just finished just a couple minutes ago and I got the news of what happened by a mutual friend who went to the wedding (I didn‚Äôt know he was a mutual friend or going to the wedding. I told him about the situation a while ago and he decided to let me know).

Friday: CN kept looking over the fence. I would have turned on sprinklers, but I don‚Äôt have any because I don‚Äôt really have grass in my backyard. Later in the day, a police car pulled into CN‚Äôs driveway and a bit after, it left. CN‚Äôs ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù of staring at me continued a lot more after that. I don‚Äôt understand why she wastes her time doing it. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel uncomfortable.

Saturday: Some people knocked on my door mid day asking if I could let them into the backyard to set up for the bridal party. I called GD and he said it was the right people (just to be safe). They set up some surprisingly expensive and nice decorations and furniture in the yard (not in a destructive way). People come in and out while setting up and the backyard looks amazing. CN continuously peered over the fence for a good amount of time, but I didn‚Äôt care. Around 6, B and all the bridesmaids (I‚Äôll do M for bridesmaids) (also about 20 bridesmaids there). I stayed inside mostly, but they occasionally asked me to come out and they drunkenly thanked me. I think the Ms were very wealthy as I received a little over 3K in ‚Äútips‚Äù from them as I occasionally brought out a carton of ice cream. Well worth it I think.

More to the events of the party. CN had a campfire in her backyard around 9, but there wasn‚Äôt really any wind, so the smoke just stayed in her yard. I think she tried to smoke us out, but maybe she was just having a little fire (I doubt it though). She then gets her hose to put out the fire and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù sprays water over the fence. Eventually, once the party winds down and they‚Äôre packing up, B hands a card signed by all of them thanking me for hosting with additional tips inside (about 2K). I was honestly stunned how nice they were.

Around 11, a very drunk CN bangs on my front door as I‚Äôm about to go to sleep. I don‚Äôt answer, but have the video on the doorbell camera. She leaves after a bit and I go to bed.

This morning: this is a secondhand account, so I won‚Äôt have all the details. CN comes to the wedding in her very white dress and demands to be let in, but the security denies her. She tries to push the security, but he isn‚Äôt fazed. People were watching, but my friend who was there had to go do something (I didn‚Äôt ask what). When he gets back, CN isn‚Äôt there.

What‚Äôs happening on my side: this is my account that is right after, but before I got the news about what happened. CN bangs on my door and tries the knob. Since I was getting groceries a bit before, I had accidentally left it unlocked. She comes into my house. I call the cops as soon as I see her open my door. I run upstairs while I give the info to the cops. CN screams at me and eventually slaps me in the face. I‚Äôm screaming at her to leave and she tries to slap me again. I grab her wrist and she screams. I basically drag her out the front door right as the police arrive. She is put in the back of the cop car and the police interview me. I tell them and they leave, then I get the news.

CN is not back. I honestly won‚Äôt argue with people about if this is true or not as what happened this morning doesn‚Äôt feel real even though I just lived through it.

Update 20: This is probably the final update as I doubt any new updates will come. CN still hasn‚Äôt come back from the police station, or she‚Äôs been hiding in her house. If she hasn‚Äôt come back (which I think), I think she might have not been able to pay bail, but I have no legal knowledge really. She‚Äôs apparently facing north of 3 years in jail, but there‚Äôs a good chance she‚Äôll get less or not at all. I grilled some food Saturday and hosted a good amount of the neighborhood. As much as I would like to say I was cool and collected after the assault, I felt a bit shaky and  not great, so having some people over seemed like a good idea. I think it‚Äôs mostly worked.

I‚Äôve shared two layout versions, the only difference is that the kitchen and dining areas are flipped. Would really appreciate your thoughts on which layout works best, and anything I might be missing!

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre aiming for:
- My husband is an avid home cook, so we want the kitchen to feel connected. ideally with views to the garden (and pool) and family room, so he‚Äôs not cut off from the rest of us (especially our toddler).
- We live in the tropics, so indoor-outdoor flow is key, especially easy access to the garden and pool.

- I love the idea of placing the kitchen at the end of the house overlooking the garden ‚Äî but it limits wall space for storage, which is a downside.

- We entertain often (weekly dinners with friends, family, and colleagues), so both kitchen function and dining flow really matter.

- I‚Äôm conflicted about the dining room. I want it to feel like a real space, but I know formal dining areas can go underused.

- I prefer some separation between rooms, not a totally open-concept plan. I like when rooms have character and partial definition. But I also want to see my toddler everywhere lol.

Would love to hear your take on the two versions.
Thanks in advance

1lc8wp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lime-Time-Live/comments/1lc8wp6/joys_jubilee/,Joy's Jubilee,"‚ÄúC‚Äômon, Jeremy! Hurry up!‚Äù I could hear Marcus whine from the other side of the bathroom door. I simply rolled my eyes, and continued to comb my hair to perfection, and apply my cologne. I opened the door and peered down at my seven year old brother, as an expression of annoyance dominated his face. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna be late ‚Äòcuz of you!‚Äù He grumbled.

Dad walked by, making final preparations in the house, and ruffled his hair. ‚ÄúRelax, kiddo. Joy‚Äôs Jubilee isn‚Äôt going anywhere.‚Äù

I nodded, agreeing. I don‚Äôt know why Marcus is so worked up, the dumb amusement park is open until 10 tonight, and we‚Äôll still probably make it right when it opens. I could tell there was no logic in Marcus' fidgeting and frustration. The fact of the matter to him was simple:  we were supposed to be at a theme park today, and at that moment, we weren't.

When I walked down the hall to get my shoes on, Marcus nearly knocked me over rushing to the front door. ‚ÄúJoy‚Äôs Jubilee: Where a kid like me, can be totally free!‚Äù He sang, like he‚Äôs heard in the jingle countless times.

‚ÄúAh, that reminds me, honey- we have headache medicine in the car, yeah?‚Äù My mom asked as she turned to dad. He simply nodded, pouring the pot of coffee into two separate containers.

‚ÄúHere, you‚Äôll need this too.‚Äù He laughed, handing her the container. With one last check around the house, we piled into the van, and hit the road, ready for a two hour journey. We spent most of the time listening to Marcus excitedly planning what he wants to do first, and listening to him loudly watch video‚Äôs starring Joy the Juniper Tree. I found myself staring out the window as the countryside rolled by. While I found Joy‚Äôs Jubilee fun, I‚Äôd always get a small pit in my stomach whenever we went. Dad assured me that we picked a good time of the year, and that there was nothing to worry about, but as I watched the clouds roll by, I couldn‚Äôt shake my tiny feeling of unease. I tried to think about all the people that‚Äôd be there that day, in hopes that it‚Äôd help. Before I knew it, however, we passed by a sign with a cartoon tree on it, with the words ‚ÄúHowdy, folks! This way to Joy‚Äôs Jubilee!‚Äù plastered in colorful writing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Joy!‚Äù Marcus squealed, as if it‚Äôs the first time he‚Äôd seen it. We managed to slowly drift in a sea of parked cars, before we found a spot. The four of us wobbled out of the car, stretching our legs, before we were hit with a spray of white mist.

‚ÄúDad! Warn me next time, geez! I almost had my mouth open.‚Äù I coughed and sputtered. The smell of bananas and coconut overpowered my nose, as dad shook the spray-can of sunscreen, before hitting us with another dose, like an exterminator to a persistent roach.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be too careful, boys! Close your eyes!‚Äù He said over the hiss of the can, before he turned to my mother. She eyed him coldly.

She only uttered, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Before snatching the can away from him, and spraying herself down.

With the whole family properly coated, we began the trek to the front gates of Joy‚Äôs Jubilee. The large coasters, and other various attractions crested over the treeline as we were faced with the large, colorful sign of Joy and her seedlings, at the entrance of Joy‚Äôs Jubilee. Marcus could barely stop moving, jumping in place excitedly as Dad paid for the tickets. Dad had us all sign the waiver, before handing it back to the ticket person. The person handing my dad the tickets smiled, with their awkward, wooden smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Joy to have you here!‚Äù They chirped with a rehearsed cadence. 

With a swing of the turnstile, we were past the front gates, into the main part of the park, Joy‚Äôs Junction, filled with food stalls of all kinds, and plenty of overpriced merchandise, all to the theme of a fairy grove. ‚ÄúPark Map? Buttons? Balloons?‚Äù The seedlings were every few feet or so, each with a chipper grin, and the same, clear cadence. The older I got, the more unnerving I found the seedlings to be. They were so lifelike, from a distance. The closer you got, however, the more their skin looked like bark, and their eyes seemed too glossy. ‚ÄúHow about a shirt, commemorating our newest seedling, Glenda?‚Äù One held up a shirt, a cartoonish seedling girl‚Äôs face in the middle of the shirt, with the words ‚ÄúGlenda‚Äù in a cutesy font underneath, and the Joy‚Äôs Jubilee logo next to it.

Marcus had no time for the seedlings, however, as he rushed past them to the center of Joy‚Äôs Junction, where there she stood herself- Joy the Juniper. A gigantic, towering tree,a crown of branches with berries, she stood in the middle of the plaza, fenced off on all sides. Her eyes were currently closed. A small wave of calm ran through my shoulders.

‚ÄúHIIIIIII JOOOOOY!‚Äù Marcus called out to the tree, and waved. Dad came up to him, and placed his hand on Marcus‚Äô shoulder. ‚ÄúMarcus, don‚Äôt tell me you asked to come here for your birthday, just to say hi to a tree, hmm? I bet the line to Forest Flyers is pretty low, if we hurry.‚Äù Marcus spun around excitedly, giggling, and started running in the direction he knew the coaster was in. ‚ÄúHurry, hurry!‚Äù He called to us over his shoulder.

From Forest Flyers, we hit Spinning Sunflowers next, followed by The Boar, one of the newer, high speed roller coasters. Dad insisted we hit the Atrium of Legendary Botanists next, despite the fact that he always slept through the show. By now, we were getting pretty hungry, and so we sat down for a bite to eat over at Oakey-Dokey. Even as the seedlings catered to us, bringing the food over in a quick and expert manner, I was enjoying myself thoroughly. I did notice my berry smoothie tasting a bit off, which was weird, as it was usually my favorite thing to get. Beyond that, the worries of the day seemed so far away in that moment. It was when I heard Joy‚Äôs voice over the speakers, that my gut did a flip.

‚ÄúHowdy ya‚Äôll! This is your good friend Joy speaking! In just 30 minutes, we‚Äôre going to have a special seedling ceremony! Now ain‚Äôt ya‚Äôll just lucky?‚Äù It was clearly a recording, but it didn‚Äôt make me feel any better. ‚ÄúNot sure where to go? Don‚Äôt worry, my pals, the seedlings, should be able to git you back on over to Joy‚Äôs Junction lickety quick! Remember folks, attendance is mandatory- Not like you‚Äôd want to miss it anyway! Later, ya‚Äôll!‚Äù

The crowd of people around us at the Oakey-Dokey started murmuring to themselves, some getting up right away to secure good seats to the ceremony. I looked over to my Mom and Dad, who snuck a concerned look to each other, before putting a smile on for me and my brother. ‚ÄúWow, what are the chances?‚Äù My mother started, beaming at us.

Marcus hopped up. ‚ÄúOh boy! A seedling ceremony?! I haven‚Äôt seen one in like, forever!‚Äù He cheered. It‚Äôs true, we hadn‚Äôt seen a seedling ceremony over the last four or five times we‚Äôve been, though it doesn‚Äôt make the process any easier. We quickly finished our meal, as the seedlings corralled us all back to the plaza near the front of the park, where rows of seats were lined up. We were ushered into a row towards the middle, as more and more guests were packed in. The crowd bustled with an excited, nervous energy.

When no more people seemed to be seated, a rustling, creaking noise had murmured the whole crowd. All eyes looked forward, as the Juniper tree groaned, and shook. Two large, oaken eyelids split open, revealing the dark, amber eyes underneath. More crackling of bark shook the air around us, as the tree opened it‚Äôs woody, maw. ‚ÄúActhoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa.‚Äù A booming, ancient voice echoed amongst the crowd. Overhead, the cutesy voice of Joy from the cartoons called out over the loudspeakers. ‚ÄúFor years, I, Joy, the spirit of whimsy, have made Joy‚Äôs Jubilee a place for all manner o‚Äô folk to come and take a load off. Joy‚Äôs Jubilee is a place where kids can be free to be how they want to be, without the cares of the outside world. Don‚Äôt worry, adults, that goes for the kids in all of us.‚Äù This line garnered some polite chuckles from the crowd. The loudspeaker voice continued.

‚ÄúToday, we got something special for you folks- a seedling ceremony! We‚Äôll start by saying goodbye to our oldest seedling, our dear Agatha.‚Äù The crowd applauded, as a creaky, slower seedling made their way down the rows, past the opened gate, and up to Joy. On stage, near the other seedlings, there was a clear difference in Agatha‚Äôs appearance, the wood of their skin chipped and discolored, their posture more hunched, compared to the rest of cheery seedlings on stage.

‚ÄúAgatha has provided over 100 years of fantastic service to our friends visiting us every day here at Joy‚Äôs Jubilee, and with that, we give a hearty, Joy filled ‚ÄòThank you!‚Äô‚Äù The speaker voice exclaimed, as the crowd cheered and clapped at the seedling, who bowed with what little energy they had left.

‚ÄúAnd now, join as all as we wave goodbye to Agatha, as she returns to where all seedlings start- back to my heart.‚Äù The speakers crackle out overhead, as the real Joy opens her mouth wide, the wood splintering to reveal a dark, pitch black chasm. With one last wave goodbye to the crowd, the withered seedling took measured steps, entering inside the shadowy maw, before Joy clamped down, with no trace of the seedling remaining. There was a moment of creaking, and silence, before the speakers started back up.

‚ÄúWell now, folks, if there‚Äôs one thing ol‚Äô Joy knows, is that nature is a cycle- to every end, there is a neeeeewwww beginning!‚Äù The crowd cheered with a nervous energy, some people fidgeting in their seats. My heart caught in my throat.

‚ÄúNow ya‚Äôll, listen carefully. Can you hear me? Can you understand me?‚Äù The cartoon voice overhead giggled, as the tree in front of us, opened it‚Äôs mouth again. ‚ÄúActhoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa. Acthoo Garuuuuum De Ogoraaaaaa.‚Äù It repeated, with a deep rumbling and shuddering. With every repetition, I sighed in relief. I couldn‚Äôt understand what she was saying. What I heard next to me had my heart shatter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here, Joy!‚Äù Marcus laughed playfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here!‚Äù He attempted to get out of his seat, and I tried to stop him. ‚ÄúMarcus, no, stop. Don‚Äôt move.‚Äù I whispered, trying not to call attention to the seedlings who were walking up and down the rows. Marcus looked up at me and frowned, folding his arms. Our parents quickly realized what was happening, and looked on in horror.

‚ÄúHow come? Jeremy, Joy is looking for me!‚Äù He whined loudly, wiggling further out of his seat, despite my attempts to push him to sit back down. By now, a few seedlings started walking into our row, seeing the commotion. They take one look at Marcus, and they all nodded. By now, mom‚Äôs inconsolable, as dad stood to try to reason with the incoming seedlings. ‚ÄúNow listen here, maybe he‚Äôs just making it up-‚Äù He tried to rationalize, but the seedlings brushed past him easily, with a strength that betrayed their smaller, childlike shapes. One of the seedlings held Marcus by his hand.

I stood up, ready to swing at the seedling who had my brother, and I threw my fist, my nerves fried, my brain going in a million directions. The seedling didn‚Äôt react to the impact, and two more rushed over to me, and hold me down in the seat. ‚ÄúMarcus! No! Please!‚Äù I screamed, as Marcus waddled down the aisle, hand in hand with the seedling. The seedling took Marcus to the front of the tree. The crowd cheered as the little boy, my brother, stood before the stretching Juniper, with some of the crowd whispered to each other, some hugged their own children tightly in relief. Marcus waved to the crowd, before the loud, groaning voice of the tree rumbled again. ‚ÄúKorunnnn Goruvta‚Ä¶..‚Äù

I saw Marcus say something to the tree, which I can guess were the words ‚ÄúMy name is Marcus.‚Äù The tree stood motionless for a moment, and as much as I struggled and screamed, I couldn't break free of the seedlings who held me, as Joy‚Äôs mouth creaked open once again, widely, enough to accommodate a person. Marcus hesitated, before he stepped inside. When Joy‚Äôs mouth closed, I felt my whole body go numb, and limp in shock. I could barely register the overhead speaker talking once more.

‚ÄúEveryone, please join me in a Joyful welcome as we meet Marcus, our newest seedling!‚Äù The crowd erupted in cheers, as numerous amounts of berries grew in a rapid frenzy on Joy‚Äôs branches, before falling to the floor, for the seedlings to collect for various recipes around the park. Joy‚Äôs mouth creaked open, and out stepped a seedling, identical in size, clothing, and hair as the rest of the seedlings. It‚Äôs his face that caused me to shudder, sobbing silently, and have my mother‚Äôs wails carry through the crowd. It was Marcus‚Äô face.

Marcus waved to the crowd, before joining the other seedlings in a joyous hug. Without even glancing our way, he ran off to who knows where with a group of them. A jingle played overhead, before Joy closed her eyes, signifying the end of the celebration. One final time, the chipper speaker voice comes to life, with accompanying cheesy music. ‚ÄúThank you all for joining us in our special Seedling ceremony. I hope ya‚Äôll will join us again real soon!‚Äù I turned to face my parents, speechless, as the crowds dispersed. I noticed a good chunk of the crowd heading to the closest shirt stall crowding to buy something. One member of the crowd turned to reveal their latest purchase.

There's barely anyone else here, it's just him... and other bunch of fellow weird guys as well. Some are hanging out together near a coffee shop, some are simply sitting on benches, while the rest of them are doing the same as the teenager. Before he could pull out his phone to watch silly videos, he spots a sleeping colorful player on a bench, to which he approaches and stands next to him. Looking around, he sees that other weird guys are staring at him and the boy, one of them who's close to them uses simple sign language, telling him to take him to his house. He nods once in response, stares at the teenage player, then carefully picks him up... 

As he's about to teleport away, without warning, the game glitches out for a brief moment, causing most of the mute grey players here to get startled. Sweating profusely, the young weird guy almost immediately teleports away with the colorful sleeping boy.

1lc8u9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lc8u9g/he_lives_amongst_you/,He lives amongst you,"A shadow was cast over us. A silent shriek that haunted history since we first took breath. While our ancestors feared the predators luring in the dark, they missed the monster hiding amongst them. He has no origin. He has no soul to call his own. His only reason to persevere is to feast on our suffering. Or so I was told.

Throughout the recorded history only a few noticed his presence. I would have never learned of this foul beast if it hadn‚Äôt been for my father, who taught me once I was old enough. A family secret passed down the generations, bound to an oath to avenge the fallen. I wish my father would have taken the truth to the grave.

At first, I believed him to be mad; the beast was nothing but a ghost of his tormented mind. But the evidence he showed me convinced me of the opposite. In many human catastrophes, countless bloodbaths, or killings of innocence, he had his hands in. From the dawn of our species to now.

The writings my father revealed to me seemed a crude joke at first. But the more he amassed on me, the more my mind struggled to deny the truth. Once I saw the pictures, my skepticism died. A shade striving through human filth. Every step he took sent waves throughout the place he had infiltrated.

Sometimes he orchestrated entire uprisings that could only end in blood with only crows reigning supreme over the graveyard he had filled. Though more often than I would like to believe, all he needed to do was a minute action. Nothing but a little push to cause a ripple that would summon a tsunami.¬†

An unfortunate accident of someone important or the right words whispered into the ears of a future terrorist. Despite my extensive studies of the beast, I can‚Äôt tell how he knows who or what to influence to bring his wanted outcome. Perhaps he can see the future or all the different potential futures. Perhaps he is just guessing, and only his successful attempts have been documented. His failures would remain unknown to us. If there are any.

As to what I believe, I think the beast can glimpse into the human heart. It can decipher what we carry in our chest, hidden even from ourselves. With this information, the beast can play every human to a degree where it appears to be mind control. His capabilities are more akin to rewriting fate; as if he put us all on a determined path that would bring nothing but destruction.

This, at least, is what my father, my family, and every other doomed soul believed about him. To explain further, dear reader, you have to indulge me. Before unmasking the beast, I have to describe what brought me to the point of writing it all down so other people could learn of this thing. Then you will understand.

As I said, my father opened my eyes to the harsh truth when I was an adult. But even before that, I could tell something was wrong with my father. He always appeared to be preoccupied. As if something was haunting his mind. Father never cared for any of my interests or me in particular. Mother and I were nothing but noise irritating his important work. I asked Mother a few times why Father behaved in such a way. She knew about the beast, but I can‚Äôt tell when Father explained it to her.

‚ÄúYou will see, Jonathan,‚Äù she used to say. ‚ÄúSoon you will see.‚Äù

The only time Father invested his precious time into me was due to my education. Anything besides the best wasn‚Äôt good enough. Father never raised his voice against me or hit me, but he punished me with silence. His eyes were always cold, but when I couldn‚Äôt meet his high expectations, they gained a certain loathing for me. Before his disinterest would originate from a genuine lack of care, now it would arise from disdain. Only when I redeemed myself did he cease.

Praise was a rare occurrence but when it came, I held on to it like a thirsting man to water, using up every bit of it in my fruitless attempt to satiate myself. Mother was much the same. It might sound cruel, but I didn't think of her as a person. She served more as an extension to my father. She never spoke about the time before she met him. The way she acted, you would think there was no such time. I don‚Äôt know what she saw in him to cast aside her identity and any hope for a loving husband in favor of my father, who appeared to have lost all interest in her once I was born.

The only reason to be intimate with her was to create me. Nothing had any sentimental value according to my father. It was nothing but a means to an end. My mother to birth an heir, and me to carry on the family oath. An oath inherited from father to son for lord knows how long. My family history is not something I enjoy studying. It is filled with tragedy and agony; much brought on by my ancestors themselves in their obsessed drive to hunt the beast.

I can only speculate how my grandfather treated my father, but by his hostile demeanor, it couldn‚Äôt have been better than my upbringing. Worse by the way he screamed in his sleep. Whatever it was, Father never dared to speak it out loud, but it influenced his every action and instilled him with the drive to end this generational-spanning pursuit. I shared this desire to end it all, as the thought of putting a child of mine through the same training I went through filled me with dread.

Every waking hour was focused on strengthening my body and honing my mind. I had to endure several harsh years of combat training and study concerning the beast. All for increasing my chance to not just survive an encounter with him but to also defeat him. Despite my father‚Äôs many shortcomings, he knew his craft and how to pass on his knowledge and skill to the next generation.

In these years, I learned to hate my father in earnest. Before that, I was afraid of his judgment and yearned for his approval. But after receiving his complete attention, I came to understand that my father‚Äôs opinion shouldn‚Äôt be something to be considered. But I stayed. I stayed by my father‚Äôs side and did everything he told me to do.

After just a year, I had all the expertise to flee his grasp and survive on my own. Then why didn‚Äôt I? Easy, he had a point. The beast had to die. The fallen deserved to be avenged. And while my father was someone that I didn‚Äôt owe anything to, he was my best chance in eliminating the beast.

I think it was during the fourth year of my training that my father either thought I was prepared enough, or he couldn‚Äôt wait any longer. He was possessed by the wish to be the one who defeats the beast and puts an end to his secret reign. Gathering all the intel we had on the beasts, collected over countless decades by my family, we crafted our plan.

Based on all we had on the beast, we could narrow down his current location and identity. The beast wasn‚Äôt just a master manipulator but also a genius actor. How many characters he made up over his long existence to blend into human society is impossible to tell. Tricking such a being should appear to be impossible, but my father and I noticed something.

Hidden underneath all the evidence of the beast‚Äôs existence and his deeds, there was a pattern. He was unstable. Despite all the knowledge and cunning he had, he often committed grievous mistakes, which seemed to pile up over the years. Did he lose his caution, as no one had been able to stop him yet? Or was something else occurring?

At this point, we couldn‚Äôt say, but we knew for certain that the beast wasn‚Äôt perfect. Take my family, for example. As I have already mentioned, many of my ancestors didn‚Äôt enjoy a long life. Dedicating yourself to a war against the devil himself didn‚Äôt just promise a constant threat to your physical health but also to your psyche. While the beast laid waste to several members of my bloodline, many more couldn‚Äôt handle the truth and looming shadow of the adversary, taking solace in drugs or alcohol. Or mere severe measurements.

Why then didn‚Äôt the beast end my family? Why take the risk of anyone coming for you; no matter how slight the chances of one‚Äôs own loss? The answer is the beast had tried. He had tried to kill every single one of my ancestors but failed to do so. Multiple times he came close, but always one member of my family escaped. Why not turn the tables and hunt the hunter? Because for some reason, the beast couldn‚Äôt.

Furthermore, the beast showed periods of inactivity. While measuring his actions proved near impossible, as often his influence was too faint to notice, we were able to map his deeds. Similar to his incompetence, his level of downtime was increasing. Did he need to rest more the further he aged? Questions over questions and there was only one way to answer them all.

My father and I took a great risk by going after the beast with such lacking intel, but both of us were keen to end the hunt. It appeared we didn‚Äôt just inherit the responsibility to stop the beast but also the tiredness of an entire bloodline, fighting for far too long. So, after months of observation and stalking, we were able to find him.

With the difficult part done, we went for the near-impossible one. Catching him. You see, Father didn‚Äôt just want to assassinate the beast, he wanted to capture him. The family records indicate that the beast isn‚Äôt someone to be trifled with, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to be unkillable. Ageless yes, but not immortal. This being said, he would not die as easily as a human being would.

One of my ancestors for example shot the beast six times in the chest. The bullets drove him to death‚Äôs door, but he succeeded in escaping justice despite his injuries. This showed us that we couldn‚Äôt believe normal measures to be sufficient to accomplish the deed. But perhaps it would have been. We were certain the beast was weakened, so maybe a well-timed bullet to the head would have been all it needed.

But no, father wasn‚Äôt willing to take any more risks. So, we decided to capture him and to take our time ending him. To accomplish this, we started to poison him. Small doses at first, nothing that should alarm him. We wanted to test out whether it would numb him enough to seize him.

One of the training fields which I had to master was deception and disguise but fooling the fools‚Äô lord was impossible. Once alarmed, the beast would vanish, and it would take decades to find him again. So, we couldn‚Äôt come into direct contact with him, but with the people around him.

The coffee shops the beast loved to visit, his workplace, and his favorite restaurant. The beast is a creature of habit, and we had his schedule mapped out. We knew when he wasn‚Äôt nearby, so we could infiltrate his surroundings to place our drugs and poisons. And within days, our plan proved itself successful.

The beast appeared sick, barely able to keep his eyes open. His workplace ordered him to stay put at home and only return once cured. Dear reader, you might question our strategy. How could a being such as the beast ever fall sick? Wouldn‚Äôt such a creature be immune against all mortal illnesses?

The short answer is no. The beast‚Äôs body had been ravaged by the plague three different times. This allowed some of my ancestors and other hunters to find and fight him. But no matter the infliction, he persevered, but he suffered, nonetheless. And, more importantly, he was afraid for his life.

The beast did as he was told and remained at his home. On the third day, he went out to do some shopping. He had no one in his life to do this for him, fitting for a being of his nature. This was when we ambushed him. My father lured him next to our van by asking for directions. I told you, dear reader, I fear that the beast can look into the human heart and read it like a book. He should have noticed our intentions immediately right away. I thought the sickness was hindering his observation skills. Furthermore, I thought the beast believed himself safe, having forgotten all his caution.

Father distracted him for a few moments, so I could sneak out of the van. It happened within moments. The beast described which direction my father should take to reach his destination as I flung my arm around his neck and injected him with a mixture of drugs strong enough to knock out a horse. He was struggling underneath my hold, and I noticed his inhuman strength. If he hadn‚Äôt been weakened before, he could free himself with ease. As the mixture began to spread, I dragged him into the van. Once I closed the door, he had lost consciousness.

We brought him to our home and locked him up in our basement. Our house was reinforced and prepared for a direct assault of the beast. But also, to keep it there if the opportunity should open itself up to us. We bound him to a chair with locks of steel inside a cage. There were no windows, and the only door could take a rocket blast. Just for good measure.

I don‚Äôt know how long we watched his unconscious body. The arch enemy of not just our family but our very species trapped in front of us. Quite the sight to behold. Or so it should have been. I knew the beast looked like a common man, but you expect to see something in him. Some minute detail he got wrong. Something that would mark him as the devil. But no, he looked like someone ordinary. A bit disappointing.

He stirred after a few hours. He took in his surroundings, and the realization of his situation dawned on him. The lord of fools could act like no one. He begged. He sobbed. Screams for help. The beast fought against his restraints, roaring to be freed. My chest tightened at his performance. If I had been a lesser man, I would have believed him.

Father wasn‚Äôt moved either. He took his seat in front of the beast and began his questioning. He was keen to learn more about him before killing him.

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, man?!‚Äù the beast cried. ‚ÄúI have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù

Every time the beast failed to answer, Father hit him. Strong from the beginning, but his punches lacked the ferocity I knew my father to be capable of. That changed within an hour. Blood littered the floor accompanied by several teeth. It was a difficult thing to watch. The never-ending cries and my father‚Äôs wrath.

‚ÄúShow yourself, devil!‚Äù my father screamed. He seized the beast by his hair, wet with sweat and blood. ‚ÄúYour lies won‚Äôt convince anyone!‚Äù

The beast‚Äôs face was swollen. His eyes were shut, and his nose was broken several times; any resemblance of a human appearance was beaten out of his features. My father collapsed in his chair, panting. He had kept himself in peak condition. He could run any marathon with ease and his punches could crack a human skull with just one hit. That the beast had survived his barrage for hours by this point proved beyond a doubt that this wasn‚Äôt a man in front of me.

‚ÄúJonathan, do it,‚Äù Father said, wiping away the blood from his hands.

I took out the bag of tools we had prepared for this moment. I do not intend to describe what I did to the beast. My father took joy in his torment. That‚Äôs why I think we kept him for as long as possible. Not to learn anything, but to make him suffer. To force the devil to endure his own domain for once, share the fate of any poor sinner, doomed for eternity.

I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Often, I had dreams of grandeur. Of me being the savior that would free humankind of their worst adversary. That I would make the beast experience true regret once I was finished with him. Reality was less spectacular. I tortured him. Every pain you could imagine, I drowned him in. Agony you couldn‚Äôt even begin to grasp. Even if you torment the devil himself, your hands will be soiled by sin that can‚Äôt be washed away. It shouldn‚Äôt. It should stick to you to remind yourself what you are capable of and willing to commit.

Three days. Three days the beast endured‚Ä¶ no, three days I endured.

Until this point, I had successfully disassociated myself from the situation and me. But as I was taking a break, cleaning myself, I started shaking. I couldn‚Äôt stand any more of this.

‚ÄúJust say it,‚Äù I said, turning towards the beast. ‚ÄúJust tell him what he wants to learn.‚Äù

The beast was covered in blood and wounds. I hadn‚Äôt left a single spot untouched. His flesh was burned, cut, crushed, and worse. How many bones I broke or limbs I destroyed, I don‚Äôt dare to ponder. His body was more composed of freshly made scars than anything else, burrowing deep, speaking of pain reaching down towards hell. Yet, he hadn‚Äôt died.

The beast‚Äôs head hung low, twitching. He was muttering something to himself. I grabbed a knife for the chance he would try something and approached him. I had to step next to him to hear his weak whispers.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wake. Let me sleep. I can‚Äôt endure it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThen confess!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBe truthful towards my father, and I promise your suffering will cease!‚Äù

The beast shook his head, tears falling. ‚ÄúIt hurts‚Ä¶ it hurts so much‚Ä¶‚Äù

Somehow, I knew he wasn‚Äôt speaking about the torture I put him through. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What is hurting you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy head‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs full. Please, I don‚Äôt want to wake‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, devil? Answer me?!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt hurts?!‚Äù the beast screamed. He jerked his head up, staring at me. I was startled, moving away from him. While his eyes had been shut swollen two days ago, his body had an unnatural capability to heal itself. Consequently, the swelling had receded, and I could see them. His right eye still had the light blue tone as when we captured him, but not his left one. The iris was drenched in a dark that would devour you if you wouldn‚Äôt be careful with a hot crimson star in its midst. It burned. An inferno trapped inside his head, so intense it blinded me.

‚ÄúIt hurts! It hurts! It hurts!‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt stop screaming the same phrase again. He wanted to trash around, the bindings cutting into his flesh as they held him. He threw his head back, his chest rising and falling in violent interludes. Blood poured out of his left eye, red tears descending like a comet toward the ground. The look he gave me. No malice, no promise of revenge or carnage. Inside this trapped star of his, I saw no devil but a broken being, driven mad.

His wild stare pierced into me with the weight of too many lives. ‚ÄúWhy did you wake me?! Why?!‚Äù

Like a savage monster, the beast rampaged against his chains. A rage born from something I couldn‚Äôt understand took hold of him. But neither my father nor I were the target of his ire. I think the world itself or perhaps something grander laid at the core of his wrath. Too big to seize or to rip apart. Without a direct perpetrator to take revenge against, the beast seemed to want to tear apart anything too close to it, blinded by his inner turmoil. Something needed to die to clench this lust of his.

Dear reader, I can‚Äôt begin to describe the dread filling my lungs with every breath I took, pushing out the air I would have needed. Standing in close approximation to the beast and his anger crippled my mind and body, forgetting how to perform the simplest of tasks. How do I move my legs? How do I blink? How do I breathe?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all your fault!‚Äù the beast spat at me. ‚ÄúAll of you should go to hell! You should burn! All of you! Burn, you should! Burn!‚Äù

As his left eye turned towards me, I became the only thing it seemed to perceive in the whole world. Its inferno leaked out of it, and I swear, dear reader, I could feel the heat of it. It bit into me, threatening to burn away my flesh and soul alike. This little taste of it, of the agony that would await me, was all it took to make me run up the stairs and flee.

The next hours are nothing but a blur. I can recall taking my parents' car and driving until it had no fuel anymore. I left it abandoned on the street and made my way through a forest, dodging tree branches and other obstacles in my mad sprint. When I came to stop or why I don‚Äôt know.

All I remember was cowering against a massive rock, pushing my back into the moss growing on its surface. Like waking from a nightmare, I blinked at my surroundings, having to remind myself that whatever I thought to have gone through was over. That I was back in reality. Night was already on the rise, and I feared to have been lost in the forest. Thankfully, I hadn‚Äôt made it far into its green embrace and found my way out of it easily enough.

I walked all night, haunted by my own cowardice. Father would be infuriated. I would never hear the end of it. But this was nothing more than a passing thought. This cursed eye followed me like a wraith, digging its claws into my skull, refusing to let go. To find any refuge from its haunting presence, I replayed the strange rumblings of the beast. What had he meant?

I didn‚Äôt find an answer on my walk. My mind was in shambles. As the sun rose again, I had arrived at home, or what was left of it. At first glance, it didn‚Äôt seem of the ordinary. But once I noticed the bloody handprint on the open door, I knew what had happened. I stood there for a couple of minutes, licking over my dry lips.

Did I want to see my dead parents? Did I need to see their shredded corpses, their guts littered over the floor? I don‚Äôt know whether I ever truly loved my parents. Thinking of them in this regard appears alien to me. Why treat them in a way they never treated me? But as I stepped towards my old house, I could sense a tear making its way down my cheek. I felt relieved at its presence, living proof that I was still somewhat human.

It was the only one I shed for them.¬†

I won‚Äôt describe them to you. They deserve this much at least. Just let it be known that they tried to fight.

The beast had broken free of his shackles probably shortly after I fled, ripped skin and flesh still sticking to the shattered steel. In a daze, I sat down in the very spot the beast had been trapped in. I didn‚Äôt care for the blood soiling my clothing. I had bigger things on my mind.

Did I feel hate for the beast? I can‚Äôt say for sure. The glimpse I received of him had disturbed my outlook on him. But, after pondering the last conversation I had with him, I came to understand who he really was. His fate.

And here we are, dear reader. We‚Äôve reached the end of my story, but this little tale is not over yet. You might remember that I promised to unmask the beast. That is only partially true. You would be forgiven for calling me a liar. I didn‚Äôt do so with ill intent. Everything I ever committed, I ever partook in, was only for the betterment of humanity.

I believed killing the beast a great service to my species, one that would remain unknown to them all, who yet couldn‚Äôt live without my deeds. I wasn‚Äôt wrong, but my goals have somewhat shifted. And the reason for that is you, dear reader.

One of you is not who they believe they are. You are not a bad person. You didn‚Äôt choose to be born like that. I thought you were a devil. Perhaps you were once. I can‚Äôt say. But what I can say is that I think I understand your turmoil. No, his turmoil.

No mind was made to endure eternity. The weight of his memories is crushing him, aren‚Äôt they? When I had woken him, I had woken him to them. Had he really fed on our suffering, or had he lashed out against anything that had taken him out of his slumber?

Is that why he had manipulated? Why he had pushed for destruction, as it was the only act of revenge he‚Äôd had for this cruel world that had birthed him? I won‚Äôt forgive him. I don‚Äôt think anyone can. My speculations shouldn‚Äôt be misunderstood as me trying to absolve him of his sins. They are his crimes, but not yours. You are a victim, unknowingly at that. But he is the same. A victim, too, but also a perpetrator. A broken child and a savage beast. ¬†

Dear reader, I know you are not aware of the true nature of your being. You are nothing more than a pleasant dream. A dream of normality. An ordinary life, free of the curse of eternity. But every dream will come to an end. The beast will lash out again, and I can‚Äôt let this happen. Too many people have died. This needs to end.

You might wonder how I found you. How do I know you will be amongst the few to read these very lines? The answer is simple. I finally understand you. The reason my family and the others all had failed is because none had attempted to comprehend what they were hunting. The beast was never alone. You were always by his side, shielding him from his suffering. The beast had appeared unknowable. Something beyond human that we can‚Äôt ever truly predict. That only after decades of close reading we might hope to find his scent again.

But not me. Not anymore. Every step you take, every thought rushing through your mind, every tear you shed. Like an open book, you are to me now. You won‚Äôt see me coming. You won‚Äôt feel a thing. When you read this, you will think me either mad or this being nothing but a crude joke. And if you believe a single word I wrote, you won‚Äôt think yourself the beast. You will believe someone else to house the monster.

This is good. You will die convinced being human. This grace I will grant you. Why am I writing these words then? Why am I announcing my coming? It is not for my desire to tell my story or to warn you but for the beast inside. Despite being asleep, I believe him to be watching. To hear what you hear through a veil, a faint echo he can perceive.

I want him to know his suffering will end. And to you, dear reader, I am sorry. Sorry that it had to be you. May we all meet under a brighter sun. Somewhere free of curses.

And now, dear reader, it is time to say goodbye. For now.",1,1750015888.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Last year my grandfather passed away after a decades long battle with Parkinsons. He and my grandmother were married for over 50 years and they both are of middle Eastern descent (this is very important to her character).

Yesterday I had my graduation party for high-school and today we went to see his grave for fathers day. She has been fine. Basically thriving after his death. But the moment we reached his grave she started putting this show on. Leaning her body on the tombstone. Kissing it. Muttering things under her breath.

She acted exactly like this during the funeral. When the casket was being brought out she almost threw her body onto it. People had to restrain her. 

At first I felt bad for her since this was the love of her life. But I slowly realized that. SHE. Was the reason of his rapid decline in health during the recent years. 

My grandmother was his primary care taker until my father basically had to force her to hire help after my grandpa's last fall. Honestly she wasnt qualified for it. Acting like he was cured after getting a walker (she never had him use it).

My grandma wasnt the best caretaker. She acted like everything was fine even though he fell and hit his head almost 5 times on her watch. One time she decided to leave him alone (this was the last time he fell) to go to sleep. My grandpa crashed into the glass of their coffee table and had glass covering his body.

The doctors told her after his first fall he would be a bit disoriented but would live until he was maybe late 80s if he didn't fall again. But he did. Again and Again. His mental state disappeared with each fall and he basically became a vegetable.

Then a month after his death she admitted she wasnt qualified to care for him but didn't want strangers to come to her apartment to take care of him. It wasnt proper! A wife should take care of her husband.

I cant help but feel that it was her fault. I've felt like this for years. She ignored the doctor's advice and continued treating him like he was completely fine. And then started putting a show on for everyone during his funeral like his death was a shock that he was healthy and just dropped dead.


My father says that it is her culture to overreact to these things. I dont want to hate her but I dont know if I can forgive her.

Could you guys tell me if my feelings about this are reasonable or am I just being crazy and not justified with this. ",3,1750015868.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I'm almost 50 (just a month away). I was formally diagnosed at 48.

For context: I want to get major surgery, and one of the requirements is quitting caffeine. (I drink coffee daily.)

Last week, I did a hypnosis recording about overcoming addictions. I realized some things about myself, and I got rid of all my coffee and creamer right afterwards. I did keep some Mountain Dew that I bought earlier that day.

So, for the last week, I've been on drastically reduced caffeine. 

I've realized my natural, autistic state is having brain fog. I've been reflecting on my life, and seeing things in a new way. Like, in high school, I constantly got demerits for having soda in class. I needed the soda to stay alert in school. My consumption of caffeine slowly increased over my life as more and more demands were put on me.

I've been feeling shame for being mentally slow. I noticed it was hard for me to process through the fog, and I'm a slow processor anyway. So, I feel like it's being mentally slow.

I told my mom today, to explain why I might seem a little off.

All she said was, ""And the caffeine helps with that?"" And I said, ""Yes it does.""

Afterward, I was like, fuck it, I don't like feeling this way. I got back the can of coffee from the guy I gave it to, and made coffee.

I don't know if I'm projecting my feelings of shame onto her, and thus am thinking she was trying to shame me. (Based on our past. She shamed me for everything growing up.) 

Or, if she was saying it's okay to accommodate myself this way.

In the last year, our relationship has gotten better, and she's been very supportive. I don't know if she's being shaming or supportive. 

What do you guys think? (BTW, thanks for reading this far. I have to write down detailed sequences when I'm processing.)

Have you discovered things about yourself that you've tried to hide all your life?

Firstly this all took place at Uni a good 10 years ago so maybe it doesn‚Äôt really matter anymore but I just can‚Äôt shake this and desperately need some advise from people who don't know me and are unbiased, I‚Äôll do my best to keep it short but I do think the context/backstory is important.

When I (f19 at the time) first started Uni I made friends with people in my halls but only made 3 friends on my course, a girl let‚Äôs call her Red and a guy let‚Äôs call him Kyle, both also 19. We were all as nerdily into our course as each other and as I am rubbish at making friends and was quite intimidated by Uni in general I was so grateful to have them. Week 3 and Kyle and I are doing a project together and he asks if I want to have dinner with him that night at his halls. I say yes because it sounds fun and ask if we should invite Red and he looks a little hurt. A friend told me later that he probably meant it as a date. I think I should mention here that I don‚Äôt date. Still haven‚Äôt figured our quite what I am today but am comfortable telling people I don‚Äôt date, have no interest in marriage or kids or sexual relationships in general but at the time I was still very confused about what I was, thought I was probably just gay as I was more interested in girls but too afraid to tell anyone as I didn‚Äôt want to seem weird or like a toy that isn‚Äôt made right/working properly which is how I felt at the time. However I really didn‚Äôt want to loose Kyle as a friend so I went to the dinner, acted very friendly, called him mate and dude more than usual and dropped in casually that I had a boyfriend at home. He seemed disappointed but never brought anything up again. In year 2 he started dating a really lovely girl and they seemed very happy. After about three months into their relationship I broke up with my ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù as I didn‚Äôt like lying and it didn‚Äôt seem necessary anymore. When I told Red and Kyle that casually he said ‚Äúare you kidding, I fancied you for a year and NOW you‚Äôre single? FFS‚Äù I felt awkward but told him well it all worked out because he met his girlfriend and she‚Äôs amazing, he‚Äôs lucky to have her so be respectful. He dropped it after that. 

Fast forward to our third and last year, I am living with some girl friends but still tight with Red and Kyle. Kyle and his girlfriend broke up but he hadn‚Äôt tried to ask me out again. One weekend my Dad calls me and tells me they have to put our beautiful dog down. I was devastated and hated the idea of Dad being at home alone so I jump on a train to London so I can be there for him and we can grieve together. While I‚Äôm on the train I get a call from my sister saying my Grandmother (Mums mum and possibly my favourite human in the world) has just died. I was in bits. I felt horrible for my Dad but I called him and told him I had to be with Mum and changed at London for a train home. It was the worst weekend. Mum was a mess, Dad was a mess, they lived far apart so I couldn‚Äôt be with both and I just felt so horrendously small and useless not being able to help or bring my loved ones back. All this to say, I was in a bad way. I‚Äôll admit it was stupid but I spent money I didn‚Äôt have getting hammered on the train back to Uni on Sunday. On the way back I was imagining sitting in my room alone with my thoughts and couldn‚Äôt bear it so I messaged Red and Kyle on a group chat we had and said these exact words (I remember them as clear as day even though it was so long ago) ‚ÄúHey, my Grandma and dog just raced each other to the grave and I‚Äôm feeling drunk and self destructive, do you guys want to go to the pub?‚Äù Yes, horrendously needy and ‚Äúpick me‚Äù but I was in my feelings and drunk. Red messaged back that she was so incredibly sorry, that she had a final in a few days she needed to revise for but she would love it get a coffee tomorrow after our lecture and talk. Kyle replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in‚Äù I said great and which bar should we meet at. He said He‚Äôd come to mine and we could go tot he pub near my flat (we‚Äôd never been there before and he lives miles away so this seemed weird but I let it go). 

He arrives 10mins later and I ask how he got here so fast and he said he drove. I found this super weird as we were going drinking but maybe he would leave the car near mine and bus home. I ask if we should go but he holds up a bottle of gin (my Favourite) and says why don‚Äôt we drink in my room as its loud at the pub and we can really talk. Fine. I pour myself a big glass and he has a drop , I ask if he wants more than that and he says I got it for you, I don‚Äôt really drink gin. I say thank you but I have nothing to offer him. He‚Äôs messing around on my laptop and says he‚Äôs fine. I am not proud of myself but that is the last thing I remember of that night. I got black out drunk (not for the first time I was not a careful drinker back then). I woke up the next morning naked in my tiny single bed next to Kyle (Also naked) I was so embarrassed, could only imagine how awful I must have been considering I was black out drunk and had very very little experience. Not to mention I was just completely grossed out by the whole thing. Even typing this 10 years later my hands are shaking and I‚Äôm sweating! It‚Äôs so bleh. I grabbed my dressing gown and snuck downstairs and huddled up on the sofa and waited for him to wake up and leave as I had no idea what to say to him and didn‚Äôt want to see him. I eventually heard him come out of my room and leave an hour or so later. 

I should say here I take full accountability for what happened, if you drink that heavily then things happen. You can‚Äôt expect them not to and Kyle definitely didn‚Äôt put anything in my drink if anyone is thinking that, he‚Äôs not that kind of guy and it was not unusual for me to black out as I say and especially after the amount I drank. But I did feel so betrayed. Had our whole 3 year friendship just been a lie? Was he always looking for an opportunity to get in my pants? Was he ever interested in me as a person? I told a close friend what happened and said I was a bit upset, that it felt like he took advantage of me when I was down and that a real friend wouldn‚Äôt have done that but then again friends have been drunkenly sleeping together since the dawn of time. She then pointed out that HE was sober! He drove to my house so he can‚Äôt have been drinking before and he had a sip of gin after! (The amount left in the bottle was the same as when I poured my huge glass) This made me feel even grosser since it felt calculated, like he knew what he was doing. So I didn‚Äôt message him. He called me once and texted did I want to meet up but I never replied. 
At the leavers ball a couple months later I saw him and Red, we awardly hugged, we took a picture again and Red asked why I‚Äôd disappeared. I just saI‚Äôd I‚Äôd been snowed under by dissertation and finals and we moved on. At one point she joked that she was surprised I was still at the party and that I hadn‚Äôt run away yet (of the types of drunk like crying drunk or smoking drunk etc I‚Äôm the runner, like I randomly take off. I know, I‚Äôm the worst lol) Kyle said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt I know it‚Äù. When Red went to get drinks I asked what he meant and he said, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt remember us hooking up and you running out the room? I found you naked outside your friend‚Äôs room whispering her name through the door, I has  to carry you back to your room!‚Äù I felt so sick as as he said it I did remember, I was crying and just wanted to see my friend but was afraid to wake her up so was hoping she was up and would hear me but she wasn‚Äôt. I do think I sheepishly said something like ‚Äúmaybe I wasn‚Äôt in the best state to hook up‚Äù but he just made a joke about how I ‚Äúcould have at least shaved my legs if I wasn‚Äôt going to shave anything else‚Äù I think I glowed so Red from embarrassment that I lit up the room and at that point I said I‚Äôd seem someone I knew and literally ran away. Once we left uni we met up once but the friendship had splintered and there was no repairing it. I stopped responding to him in all forms and haven‚Äôt spoken to him since. 

I‚Äôm so sorry this is already so long but here‚Äôs why I am now thinking I might be the Ahole. See this is my perspective. I don‚Äôt talk about what happened much as it still makes me feel gross but I expressed to a friend of mine recently how grateful I was for his friendship as I don‚Äôt have very many straight guy friends as I‚Äôm not sure how much I trust them. He asked me why and I told me this story. I expected that he would think Kyle was a bit of a doosh, instead he called me a hypocrite!
 He said I always say how I don‚Äôt like that TV shows glamorise characters like Joey and Barney for sleeping with people and never calling them but that I did the same thing! He said ‚Äúthis guy is clearly like in love with you for three years, you text him saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm drunk, come over‚Äô which is the way everyone says ‚ÄòI wanna hook up‚Äô without sounding slutty, you sleep together, he‚Äôs thinking ‚Äòfinally we‚Äôre going to be together‚Äô and you ghost the poor dude. Bet you f*cked him right up‚Äù I was literally stunned and said I didn‚Äôt text him I texted our friend group chat and I didn‚Äôt say come over I said lets go out. He said that was semantics and its the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm drunk‚Äù bit that matters and that I cannot be that naive.  We got in a huge fight (I admit we had both been drinking) and we have since made up but I cannot shake the idea he‚Äôs put in my head that all these years I thought he betrayed our friendship for a quick shag and actually I was the Ahole who lead him on and ditched him. 
I feel sick. I accept the total of naive, I‚Äôll accept hypocrite for treating sex casually and being the ‚Äúsleeps with her friend when she‚Äôs drunk‚Äù cliche but am I the Ahole here? I feel like such an idiot asking strangers on the Internet but I don‚Äôt really like talking about this with people I know and after that reception I don‚Äôt think I ever will but Kyle still follows me on insta (I don‚Äôt follow him) should I be reaching out and apologising?!?! I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt care anymore but if I‚Äôm the Ahole please tell me reddit.

# Batman

(*by u/FrostFireFive*)

Round 1

Tim Drake hated these things.¬† Gotham City was notorious for being a place where the fringe and hidden people had gathered to socialize and build a better life.¬† Heaven knows the small district of Tynion Square had hosted a lively circle of people and the people they had loved or chased.¬†¬†

With a Soder-Cola in hand, Tim Drake sat down at the first seat he could find and made sure his name tag was on straight.¬† He had been out for a bit, but being Robin had meant he had to put his dating life on hold for a bit.¬† But with the encouragement of his father and Alfred, he was here, at the 20th Gotham LGBTQ+ Date-A-Thon.¬† A speed dating bonanza in the square.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù A blonde man sat across from him as the bell began to ring, his name tag reading Bernard. ‚ÄúSo you do these things often?‚Äù

‚ÄùNot really,‚Äù Tim said. ‚ÄúKinda busy with the job, but I figured it would be a good place to start, right?‚Äù

‚Äù One Hundred Percent,‚Äù Bernard responded. ‚ÄúOnly night of the year you can find some decent people in Gotham.¬† I swear, everyone either wants to be a Soundcloud rapper or the next Joker.‚Äù

‚ÄùYeah, Gotham has a lot of eccentrics, I mean, they‚Äôre not all bad,‚Äù

‚ÄùTell that to Batman, dude‚Äôs a freak.¬† Gives rappers and those psychos material,‚Äù Bernard responded.

Tim Drake sighed.

Round 3

‚ÄùSo what do you do for a living?‚Äù A girl with pink hair and a name tag reading Emily asked.

‚ÄùWell, it‚Äôs kinda like an internship between school. You know how it goes,‚Äù Tim responded.¬†

‚ÄúAnd how old are you?‚Äù Emily asked.

‚ÄùTwenty-One,‚Äù Tim responded.

‚ÄùAnd you still are an intern? I mean, I‚Äôm twenty-two and Stagg Chemical already offered me a full-time job,‚Äù Emily responded.¬† ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you considered your future?‚Äù

‚ÄùWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Tim began to say as the buzzer went off, and Emily moved to another table. ‚ÄúThank god.‚Äù

Round 8

‚ÄùI mean I make sure I hit the gym every day,‚Äù Anthony Lupis Jr. began.¬† ‚ÄúDad always wanted me to be the best, and in order to be the best, I need to give one hundred and ten every time I hit the weights.‚Äù

‚ÄùWeights, huh, that‚Äôs so fascinating,‚Äù Tim mumbled as he looked at the four Soder-Cola cans in front of him.¬† He was trying to keep a decent sugar buzz, but talking about weights only, well‚Ä¶weighed him down.¬†

‚ÄúYou got any hobbies? You look pretty fit yourself,‚Äù Anthony began.

‚ÄùWell, I do jog every day,‚Äù Tim lied.¬† Being Robin meant he was often in better shape than most, but at the same time, it was the physical stuff that bored him.¬† Bruce and Jason were the brawlers, but Tim was the brains, often trying to figure creative solutions to the problems in front of him.¬† ‚ÄúBut mostly I like reading, working on my computers, the occasional movie.‚Äù

‚ÄùYeah, like that new Grey Ghost, you see the trailer?‚Äù

‚ÄùI would have been better if it were more like the old serials, maybe a dash of *The Thin Man* in there,‚Äù Tim responded.

‚ÄùWhat the hell is a Thin Man, some kind of diet?‚Äù Anthony asked.

‚ÄùAnother Soder-Cola,‚Äù Tim said.

Round 12.

Tim Drake rubbed the bridge of his nose, exhausted. 11 dates, 50 minutes and each one passed him by, not wanting his number or connect.¬† He had always assumed being Robin would have put a damper on his love life.¬† But Bruce had Selina and Babs‚Ä¶kinda had Dick, and Jason had‚Ä¶had a healthy collection of books.¬† But, still he didn‚Äôt expect to feel so lonely.

Of course, as he was about to take off, his twelfth date took a seat in the chair in front of him.¬† Her blonde hair messy in a bun, with a purple hoodie that had seen better days.¬† Compared to the formality of previous dates, this one was different.¬† Even with her name tag, Steph was written in bubble letters with a bit of sparkles.

‚ÄùGood evening,‚Äù Steph muttered as she had a bit of cookie in her mouth.

‚ÄùEvening,‚Äù Tim responded.¬† ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶supposed to be here?‚Äù

‚ÄùWhat, you didn‚Äôt also sign up for the date in ten minutes deal?‚Äù She responded.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI did it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄùPeople are stuffy? I mean when my dad signed me up for this I figured there would be someone to talk to, but between the gym guy, the eager chemist, and the blonde SoundCloud guy I mean‚Ä¶just kill me,‚Äù Steph responded, trying to figure out where she remembered the man in front of her.

‚ÄùBernard was a SoundCloud guy?‚Äù Tim mumbled as he ripped the number he had given him.

‚ÄùBig time.¬† Me, I‚Äôm just here for the cookies before I head to the Monarch,‚Äù Steph explained.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMonarch, like in theatre?‚Äù Tim asked.

‚ÄùYup.¬† They‚Äôre playing some of the old Grey Ghost serials, the only good thing my dad ever showed me growing up.¬† A bit campy, but they do the big grey guy justice.¬† You know, I heard from my boss that Batman was inspired by him.‚Äù

‚ÄùReally?‚Äù Tim responded, his mind drifting to Bruce‚Äôs whole deal.¬† ‚ÄúThat would‚Ä¶make a lot of sense.‚Äù

‚ÄùRight? Too bad none of the weirdos of Gotham take after the Mad Bomber, simple plots, easy to stop, and have flair,‚Äù Steph stressed as she saw interest in Tim‚Äôs eyes.¬† The fact that he didn‚Äôt look away when she mentioned something as dorky as the Grey Ghost was promising to her.¬†

‚ÄúListen‚Ä¶if it‚Äôs not too much trouble, do you want to‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄùGo see some Ghost with a new friend?‚Äù Steph smiled.¬† ‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù As the two left the final round into the Gotham night, together.

# ¬†The Flash

(*by u/brooky12*)

Jay Garrick lifted a finger in the air, signaling to the person behind the bar counter to get their attention for another drink order. He slid his now empty cup forward, making it easier for the barman to retrieve.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your deal, guy?‚Äù

Jay Garrick glanced over at the question asker, sitting next to him. He recognized the man, another frequent visitor of the location. ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou come here like, twice a week, drink everyone under the counter, don‚Äôt so much as talk to a soul, and then wander off. Never see you talk to a lady‚Äìor a man, that‚Äôs okay too‚Äì, never see you around town, never see you on the phone with a spouse. What‚Äôs your deal?‚Äù

Jay smiled, shrugging. ‚ÄúMarried to my work, what can I say? No time for much else other than the occasional relaxation at a bar.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre one of thems folk. Lemme guess, since you‚Äôre built like a truck, army? Can‚Äôt get a girl even if you wanted, the forces messed your brain up something fierce so now you can‚Äôt talk to people?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, nothing like that. Just a fair bit of travel for work and, honestly, a lack of interest. I got good friends in relationships, but it isn‚Äôt for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlumber. Came home smelling terrible day in day out, so she left ‚Äòya. Come here were the booze overpowers all.‚Äù

‚ÄúGonna be real with you, even if you did guess my day job, I‚Äôd not tell you that you got it. I just don‚Äôt want romance.‚Äù

‚ÄúElectrician, and you‚Äôre just sick in the head. Not because you don‚Äôt want romance, just can‚Äôt see the world the same way as other people. Final guess.‚Äù

# Harley & Ivy

(*by u/ericthepilot2000*)

Robinson Park Apartments

Outside Pam Isley‚Äôs Door

‚ÄúThe Power of Love‚Äù



A lifetime ago‚Ä¶



Pam Isley busied herself in her lab.¬† Naked Cheshire blasted on the speakers while she pruned a particularly aggressive stalk of Maldita Toxicohedron.¬† It helped her relax, and since her insomnia had stretched over weeks, she could use all the relaxation she could get.¬† Not that she had to sleep, a little sun and she was good.¬†¬†

Still, it was tough to fill the days.¬† She could only post so many screeds on the internet, and while she could talk with her plants, they didn‚Äôt always have the most to say.¬†¬†¬†

She was surprised to hear the doorbell ring, not expecting any company.¬† Especially not at 3 am.¬† Nor was she expecting to see the gaunt and lifeless blonde at her doorway, deep bags under her eyes and sporting more than one fist-shaped bruise.¬†¬†

Harley was shaking, almost on the verge of tears, and Pam quickly pulled her inside, shedding her lab coat and wrapping it around her friend, bringing her to the couch.¬† A few moments later, they were each holding mugs of steaming coffee, and Ivy braced for the inevitable.

‚ÄúI swear, Red, this time, it‚Äôs over.¬† I‚Äôm done.¬† I‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Pam quickly pressed her fingers to the blonde‚Äôs lips, looking at her with affection, but also weariness as Harley silenced.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt, Harl.¬† I can‚Äôt hear it again.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Harley replied, voice trailing off.

Ivy just shook her head.¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make promises you can‚Äôt keep.¬† I‚Äôm not mad, I just‚Ä¶ You need help.¬† I can‚Äôt fix you.¬† I never could.‚Äù

Harley looked up at her through weary eyes.¬† ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

Pam stood up, taking Harley by the hands and pulling her off the couch.¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to bed.¬† Things‚Ä¶will be clearer in the sunlight.‚Äù

The next morning‚Ä¶

Pam Isley woke up and rolled over, ready to see what Harley wanted for breakfast, only to find the bed empty next to her.¬† A small note sat where her body had been just a few hours earlier.

‚ÄúDoing this for us, I promise.¬† Laters. - Harley,‚Äù the note read, with a phone number.¬†¬†

Pam Isley just smiled.



‚óÜü•¶‚óÜü•¶‚óÜ¬†



Ivy was right about one thing.¬† The morning has brought clarity.¬† Harley shielded her eyes as she looked up at the imposing Arkham structure.¬† It seemed almost fitting.¬† Her life had been irrevocably changed in these halls.¬† Starting today, it would again.¬†¬†

Harleen Quinzel took a deep breath and stepped inside.

# New Titans

(*by u/FrostFireFive*)

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you‚Äôre nervous?‚Äù Koriand‚Äôr asked as she prepared herself in her quarters.¬† The Titans had always made themselves part of Chicago.¬† From throwing out the first pitch at both Cubs and White Sox games to helping light the city‚Äôs Christmas lights, the team always wanted to know people, they were with them.

‚ÄùBecause I usually don‚Äôt do the Titans‚Ä¶outreach programs,‚Äù Kara mumbled as she adjusted her outfit.¬† Kory had asked the heroine to be more open today, as Pride was often a place for people to be free, it was also hot, as Kara adjusted the front window of her costume, larger than usual, along with her shorts.¬† ‚ÄúAnd this is the first time‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄùPower Girl is attending Pride?‚Äù Kory asked as she finished locking the collar with purple ribbons falling to the floor all around her, making a makeshift dress.¬† The outfit was based on the ceremonial dress her people wore, bright flashes of orange skin showing as she moved.¬† ‚ÄúMetamorpho and I did it last year.¬† You should see how everyone looks at us.‚Äù

‚ÄùWith‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄùWith absolute Joy,‚Äù Kory responded as she walked in.¬† Originally, it was supposed to be her alone doing this, but after a slight bribe of trading monitor duties with Nightwing, she had found that Kara had the day off.¬† She had seen the photos of last year from Linda, with Kara wearing a cut-off Superman shirt, a flag around her, and the sheer joy on her face

‚ÄùJoy‚Ä¶‚Äù Kara muttered after seeing Kory‚Äôs outfit and looking away from the orange sunline emerging from the sparkling purple fabric.¬† ‚ÄúIs something that‚Äôs new,‚Äù she mumbled.

‚ÄùJoy means being proud of yourself,‚Äù Kory said as she helped Kara secure the front of her costume.¬† ‚ÄúThe festivals of love and companionship we have on Tammeran.¬† No one bothers to wear anything.‚Äù

Kara choked in surprise for a moment before regaining composure.

‚ÄùReally?‚Äù

‚ÄùNot quite,‚Äù Kory said with a smirk as she went behind Kara and grabbed something she had prepared before the Kyrptonian heroine arrived. ‚ÄúYou are all so‚Ä¶gullible.‚Äù

‚ÄùWell, you don‚Äôt really talk about home,‚Äù Kara said as she looked away, thinking clean thoughts, as Kory bobbed back into her eyesight.

‚ÄùHome was free and full of love, love we have right now,‚Äù Kory explained as she wrapped a pride flag cape around Power Girl.¬† ‚ÄúAnd you, Power Girl, are the brightest thing out there, and deserve the joy of being you.‚Äù

‚ÄùBeing me?‚Äù Kara asked.

‚ÄùBeing you on every side of you.¬† Karen Starr, Power Girl, and Kara Zor-El,‚Äù Kory said as she looked at Kara, beaming.¬† ‚ÄúAnd telling people it‚Äôs OK to be themselves, because they see the strongest woman in the world as one of them.‚Äù

Kara quickly kissed Kory, her confidence returning.

‚ÄùAnd that I found you,‚Äù Kara said before looking at the large open window inside their room at the Tower.¬† ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù

‚ÄùAlways,‚Äù Kory said as the two took each other by the hand and flew out, open for the world to see.

1lc8g8g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lc8g8g,Bonnaroo 2025 family experience,"Hello,

We've never been to Bonnaroo. But I wanted to share our experience.

Im retired Army, so we rented a cabin on the air base nearby (Arnold's AFB) that was on the lake. We uber'd in and out daily.

Day 1 (Thursday)

Uber (Rachel) - really nice local lady in red SUV who was able to skip the main lane and take a back way to drop us off at the daily parking area. We rode a rickshaw bike to the arches and got to see wilderadoo (one of my older sons favorites).

We walked to the water fountain, then got to see the lemon twigs at this tent (they played good vibrations by the beach boys). Checked out the infinity stage (walked right to the center and looked around to see how neat the structure was). Got some hydration and lemonade then got to see Marcus kings set on the what stage Then went to check out Wisp at that tent. 

Bought Bonnaroo shirts, vampire weekend hoodies for my oldest son and I. Checked out the tyler the creator merch shipping container, a giant green shipping container labeled ""Golf"" and got my younger son a Tyler the creator hoodie.

Saw Green Velvet at the other stage, got some food (pizza, smash burgers, pork dumplings, pineapple chicken tacos), then saw Luke combs on the what stage, he brought out Miranda lambert for a duet and for her to perform a solo song. 

Then to the infinity stage to see Rebecca Black's EDM set. Then joey and valence and Brae at that tent to listen to the crowd scream ""im the baddest bitch in this club"" then back to this tent to get sprayed with Faygo.

We took the tram to the rideshare area by toll booth 2, asked a cab how much for a ride, was quoted 85, so called an Uber for 30. 

Uber (Michael) picked up us in a Tesla and took us back to base to our cabin. We took a pic in our new hoodies and played the board game Splendor before going to bed.

Day 2: 
We got the notifications thar everything was delayed and missed Rachel chinouriri, which sucked. Ended up waiting until about 4ish to get an uber (victoria) - nice local lady who was 60 but looked 40, she had a kida shortage and was super friendly. She dropped us off at toll 2 the rideshare location. We waited about 20min in the tram line but they weren't running. So we took another bike rickshaw to Centeroo, and he blew a tire on the way. We got to see him fix a tire in less than 5min and see how the sausage was made.

We hung out in a tent by the handicap access tent that gave us free popcorn and coffee while my younger son painted a roo logo. While sitting here it when we found out it was canceled. The energy left everyones face, sadness everywhere and frustration. We walked back to toll 2 and heard a bunch of frogs laughing from somewhere in the woods. It was that moment we first laughed at the situation. it sounded like a bunch of frogs laughing their ass off. We get to the rideshare location and its pure chaos with everyone trying to leave.

Uber out (oque) - White Kia soul, he had bad service and a thick accent so I had to give him step by step instructions on how to get to us since he didn't know the area and many roads were blocked. We walked about a mile down sledd road to link up with him, and finally got back to the cabin.

Everyone was devastated. There wasn't much to do in the area, and i couldnt cancel the remainder of rhe days of our cabin - so i just ate that cost even though we are not there. We decided to drive to pigeon forge and stay at an indoor Waterpark (wilderness of the smokies) for the remainder of the trip. 

The boys are now enjoying a Waterpark and im reading a book.

That was our first Roo experience. The water is always half full, or submerged completely in this case. My son really wanted to see Tyler and we were all super excited for Vampire weekend and glass animals. Luckily we will attempt to see vampire at shaky knees in SEP in Atlanta. I hope the weather gods treat us nicer then.

It is my white whale. I have literally had my mom go through my boxes from high school looking for this. 


What I remember: a new mom in Texas is seeing a shadow in her house. Only she can see it. In one scene, the shadow is in the kitchen and she can't bear to go inside, so she and the baby spend all day outside in the hot sun. 

She's struggling to fit in with the local group of moms. There's a scene where she goes to the coffee shop with them and feels really uncomfortable, and I specifically remember the line ""I realized I had committed the ultimate parenting sin- [baby name] was sleeping in a dirty diaper."" 

There's another scene where she and her husband go to a neighborhood block party and have a fight because she feels like he's flirting with her friend, one of the neighbors. 

The ghost is ultimately revealed to be a woman who had lived in her house in the 1800s and whose husband broke her arm, I believe, but for most of the book appears as a dark shadow in the nursery. I remember a part of the book where the mom is scared and shocked that the shadow has left the nursery and is now moving around the house. 


I read this in 2012-2014, I think I remember getting it in paperback at Books a Million. I have exhausted Google and chat GPT. Please help üôèüèº",3,1750014786.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False

Jesus says that the sabath was made for man, and not man for sabath. So I wonder, if someone works on sunday, but gets a day off another day during the week (assuming they don't miss their Sunday obligations), is it still considered sinful, or a mortal sin?

And secondly, say a coffee shop. Would buying from a coffee shop on sunday be considered a mortal sin? What if you don't buy but you sit there with your friends?

The idea of work on Sunday seems to not be completely black and white as to whether it is a mortal sin or not.

Edit: Also one kore thing to keep in mind. People nowadays mostly have the option not to work on Sundays or such. But if they choose to work on Sundays, we also cannot force them not to work on Sundays ourselves, it's their choice if they don't believe it to be wrong.

I started volunteering at the city department in my area, had a great time, until the city government decided that we‚Äôd better be served by the county. Bunch of people quit for their own reasons, I ended up getting hired as an EMT and Firefighter trainee in a nearby county and resigned not long after that. Dropping out of graduate school in the process. 

To say I am depressed is an understatement, I am lonely and the light has truly started to go out in my life. I entered struggling with building fitness, I did extremely well on the physical agility test to be hired finishing with 5 minutes to spare. Fitness is a journey, but that‚Äôs when the cracks started to show. Instead of being encouraged or pushed, my crew just decided to kick me while I was down. While I am in much better shape than merely two months ago and I continue to push myself, the morale has not returned. 

I work a 48/96 rotation with a crew of four. We run about 500 calls a year, some shifts we get no calls some shifts we get 5 or 6. My lieutenant is usually working on other projects while on duty, the paramedic is usually helping him, the engineer is either asleep or grumpy that he is not asleep (from what I have observed he only gets 3-5 hours of sleep every night). My department is allegedly going to put me through their academy which is fully in house. However, it is usually the engineer teaching me and it is usually just a mix of cursing, threats, and insults for any measure of failure. It has become extremely hard to work here. The Fire Chief is usually only on call, when he is in no one seems to mistreat me, but as soon as he leaves the beration and harassment resumes. 

I knew there would be a level of hazing that goes into being a probie, especially one without any fire certifications. But frankly I never expected to be treated like this or for it to be like this working here. 

I don‚Äôt mind getting up an hour before everyone to do dishes, make coffee, make sure everything is clean and breakfast is ready. That‚Äôs part of paying the dues and I am frankly happy to do it as it really is the only purpose I feel at this department right now. 

But instead, everyone trash talks everyone, everyone hates either the Fire Chief, another shift Lieutenant, or even the secretary. There does not seem to be alot of uplifting or encouragement. When I try to seek out additional training to improve myself, I seemingly get punished for it. I am afraid to ask questions, even on the most mundane things like ‚Äúis it alright if I roll this hose up?‚Äù Because if I get it wrong it just turns into me being yelled at or something similar. Surely this can‚Äôt be normal? I have made no friends at this department, it feels like everyone despises me, I PT alone (usually as the rest of the shift sleeps and usually skips PT) and follow the schedule to a T (I‚Äôm guessing it is just for show because when I show up for training no one else is usually there.)

Frankly I have thrown my hands up at the situation, taken out a $4,000 loan to pay for my FF1/FF2/HMA/HMO at an academy, and I am confused and conflicted as to what I should do next. I have debated looking for work elsewhere, perhaps being a more ideal candidate as I am already enrolled in academy and already have my EMT? I don‚Äôt know. I worry that leaving so soon would look bad to any future employer, as well as having to explain the political drama that went down at my former volunteer department even though I did not have a hand in it. 

All I know is that I am tired and lonely and the only option right now is isolation and remaining fearful while trying to remain disciplined despite the discouragement I face. I encountered so many obstacles to get this job, I surpassed them, and now all I feel is regret. ",7,1750014495.0,Firefighting,16,0.68,False

Wally Brando is wandering across this great land and into our hearts....

Twin Peaks mavens! Ahoy! I hear that slice of coffee-flavored pie you love is coming back into style...

I've been with Twin Peaks since the very beginning (I am gen x aka old), and it has always been my central touchstone with the work of David Lynch. But in 2017, when I heard TP: The Return was coming, I knew my particular brand of Twin Peaks was about to manifest in a stream of black smoke from the electrical outlet in my living room. And it did! And I freakin loved it. Maybe my favorite TV show ever? Maybe...

Cut to 2024, my buddy had been spending time in the Black Hills of South Dakota and found his way back to Twin Peaks. He called me and said he wanted to watch the Return for the first time with me and talk about it. I told him I'd do him one better -- let's watch it and record a podcast where we DECODE the entire season! He agreed....

My name is Phil. I am the creator of the Post Relevant Podcast. Season 3 of my show is attempting to decode Twin Peaks: the Return. My cohost Justin and I go pretty deep, sifting through the series episode by episode, scene by scene, often line by line. We use the text and the visuals to try to decipher exactly what Lynch and Frost are presenting in this amazing story - in my opinion, Lynch's magnum opus. This is a clip from episode 4 of the podcast, which is decoding episode 4 of the Return. Its online now!

Please note, this is a creative endeavor - I am an actor/artist/musician/writer, etc, and I put together this show with lots of love in the creative spirit of David Lynch, using sound collage, a musical score, absurdist conversations and little bits of nonsense to illustrate the larger objective of decoding Twin Peaks: the Return. Its not your typical podcast - often there's lots of weirdness and experimentation before we get to the actual decode. So be prepared! If you aren't into hearing something you've never heard before, this might not be the show for you. If you like surprises, please check it out!

I hope this message lights a backwards slow-motion flame of curiosity in your mind, and then, I hope you will check out the Post Relevant Podcast: Twin Peaks: the Return: the DECODE episode 4, now online!

I am about to start a new job and have a history of being dismissed by health professionals, so I can‚Äôt figure out whether I should get checked out for what I‚Äôve been experiencing this weekend. Can‚Äôt exactly get advice from my family either since they are pretty dismissive as well.

Anyway, about midday yesterday, while I was taking a shower, I was having some me time, and after climaxing, I developed a sudden and very painful headache. It wasn‚Äôt the worst I ever experienced, but I took 2 ibuprofen immediately after because the pain was so intense, and I had never experienced something like that before. It radiated all along my skull and even in my neck, which was stiff. The pain killers helped, but I felt kind of nauseated, weak, and just kind of weird all day. Not sure how to explain it, but there was almost a cooling sensation on parts of my head at times?

Anyway, after the pain killers wore off, the headache came back, not as intense but I still took another ibuprofen and took it easy for the rest of the night. I sort of had the chills but no fever, so I went to bed and had a decent night sleep (I‚Äôm an insomniac, so getting a full eight hours isn‚Äôt usual).

This morning, I felt okay, but my sinuses were very upset. A lot of sinus pressure and clear mucus. Figured it was just my seasonal allergies or the dry air since I live at a high altitude. Since it‚Äôs the weekend, I slowly got some coffee and breakfast and lazed around on the couch until noon. However, when I got up to get changed for the day, a new headache developed, this time around the base of my skull and along my cheek bones. It was painful enough that I immediately took some pain killers, but my ears are ringing, my neck is stiff, and I feel weak again.

While I do feel as if I need to see a doctor for this, I don‚Äôt know if this is worth a visit to urgent care or the ER, or if I can wait until I can see a primary care doc. Any advice is welcome.",0,1750014316.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

1lc85bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1lc85bh/why_choose_seventh_generation_easydose_liquid/,Why Choose Seventh Generation EasyDose Liquid Detergent Lavender Fresh 124432 Review?,"**Compact and Eco-Friendly Design**

The Seventh Generation EasyDose Liquid Laundry Detergent (124432) is a little miracle in a bottle. At just 23oz, this ultra-concentrated detergent is a fraction of the size of traditional options, yet it still packs a punch with 66 loads of cleaning power. I personally found the small, sleek design a blessing, especially since my laundry shelf is perpetually crowded with random, mismatched items. This compact size makes it incredibly easy to store, and given its reduced packaging‚Äî60% less plastic and 75% lighter than the standard 100oz bottles‚Äîit‚Äôs a fantastic choice for those trying to cut down on their environmental footprint. The bottle's simplicity doesn‚Äôt compromise usability; it‚Äôs comfortable to hold even with wet hands, and the flip-cap design ensures no cumbersome closures or messes during use.

**EasyDose Technology**

Here‚Äôs the real game-changer: the EasyDose technology. With this mechanism, measuring detergent becomes a no-brainer. You literally flip the bottle, give it a firm squeeze, and voil√†‚Äîone perfectly measured dose is dispensed. I tested this feature across multiple laundry loads, and it works flawlessly each time. This smart dosing also means less waste and minimizes the chance of overloading your washing machine with too much detergent, which often leaves those annoying sudsy residues. As someone who‚Äôs overly generous with detergent pours, I appreciated how efficient it made the process‚Äîparticularly on busy mornings when everything feels rushed!

[Check Seventh Generation 124432 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b07h3sdkdp/)

**Lavender Scent with Natural Ingredients**

What truly elevates this detergent is its refreshing lavender scent. Made from 100% essential oils and botanical ingredients, the fragrance isn‚Äôt overly strong or artificial-smelling, and it doesn‚Äôt linger too heavily on clothes. My wardrobe got a subtle, calming freshness, which I can only describe as carrying a tiny lavender field with me throughout the day. I should note, though, that if you‚Äôre extra sensitive to smells‚Äîeven natural ones‚Äîthis might be something to consider. On the plus side, the absence of dyes, synthetic fragrances, and artificial brighteners ensures this detergent is gentle on the skin, which worked perfectly for my sensitive-skinned partner. No post-laundry itching is always a win!

**Small Dose, Big Cleaning Power**

Despite its small packaging, the cleaning power of this formula is anything but small. With an advanced-enzyme formula tailored to fight stubborn stains, I managed to restore our favorite kitchen towel‚Äîwhich had become a casualty of a coffee spill‚Äîback to its original state. Admittedly, heavier, grease-based stains needed some pre-treatment, but I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs expected with most non-industrial detergents. The detergent performed beautifully on a variety of fabrics, from heavy-duty denim to delicate items. It left no residue behind, even when I pushed the limits with cold water and shorter wash cycles.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Compact, space-saving design and significant reduction in plastic use.
- Convenient EasyDose technology simplifies detergent dispensing.
- Crafted with natural ingredients, making it eco-conscious and safer for sensitive skin.
- Effective stain-fighting formula suitable for various fabric types.
- Gentle, calming lavender scent free of synthetic fragrances.

**Negatives**

- No child safety lock on the EasyDose cap, so keep it out of reach if you have curious toddlers.
- Might not fully tackle heavy grease or oil-based stains without help.
- Limited scent options for those not fond of lavender.

**Competing Products**

Several eco-conscious competitors like Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Clean Day and Method Laundry Detergent also offer natural, plant-based options. Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs has a wider variety of scents, but they lack the ultra-concentrated convenience and compact packaging that I‚Äôve grown fond of with this product. Method offers excellent stain-fighting performance but tends to lean on the pricier side per load. One area where the Seventh Generation detergent excels compared to these alternatives is its thoughtful packaging design and simplicity in dosing. While it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for occasional stain removers, it does a superb job at balancing eco-friendliness with cleaning efficiency.

**Worth Every Penny**

When measuring value, this detergent hits the sweet spot between affordability and quality.

Ever had one of those days where your brain just feels... fuzzy? Maybe you're staring at your computer screen, trying to focus, but your thoughts are scattered like confetti. Or perhaps you're studying for an exam, and new information just won't stick. We've all been there, right? That feeling of wishing you had just a *little* bit more mental horsepower.

Well, what if I told you there are natural and synthetic compounds that could potentially help give your brain that extra edge? We're talking about **nootropics**- often called ""smart drugs"" or ""brain boosters"" - and they're gaining a lot of buzz for good reason. But here's the thing: diving into the world of nootropics can feel a bit overwhelming at first. So, consider this your friendly, no-nonsense beginner's guide. We're going to break down what nootropics are, how they work, and how you can safely and smartly start exploring them to enhance your brain power.

## What Exactly *Are* Nootropics?

Let's cut through the jargon. At its simplest, a nootropic is a substance that's designed to enhance cognitive function. Think of things like memory, creativity, motivation, attention, and overall mental clarity. The term ""nootropic"" was actually coined way back in the 1970s by a Romanian chemist, Dr. Corneliu Giurgea, who created the first true nootropic, Piracetam.

What makes a substance a *true* nootropic, according to Giurgea? It should:
* Enhance memory and learning.
* Help your brain function better under disruptive conditions (like low oxygen).
* Protect your brain from chemical or physical assaults.
* Increase the efficiency of brain control mechanisms.
* Be virtually non-toxic and have few side effects.

So, it's not just about a quick energy jolt like a strong coffee. It's about supporting your brain's long-term health and optimizing its performance. Pretty cool, right?

## How Do They Work Their Magic?

You might be wondering, how can a pill or a supplement actually make your brain sharper? It's not magic, but rather a fascinating interaction with your brain's natural processes. Different nootropics work in different ways, but generally, they aim to:

* **Improve Blood Flow:** Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reaching your brain cells. Think of it like giving your brain a constant, fresh supply of fuel.
* **Boost Neurotransmitters:** These are the chemical messengers in your brain. Nootropics can increase levels of key neurotransmitters like acetylcholine (important for learning and memory) or dopamine (linked to motivation and focus).
* **Protect Brain Cells:** Some nootropics act as antioxidants, fighting off damaging free radicals, or help repair and maintain brain cell membranes.
* **Reduce Inflammation:** Chronic inflammation can harm brain health. Certain nootropics can help calm things down.

It's like giving your brain the right tools and a little tune-up so it can perform at its best.

## Nootropics 101: Where Do I Start?

Okay, this is where it gets practical. For beginners, I always recommend starting with well-researched, generally safe, and accessible options. You don't need to jump into complex ""stacks"" right away.

### Natural Nootropics You Might Already Know

You might be surprised how many common substances have nootropic properties!
* **Caffeine + L-Theanine:** This is a classic combo, and for good reason. Caffeine gives you that alert boost, but L-Theanine (found in green tea) helps to smooth out the jitters and create a calm, focused alertness. I've found this to be a fantastic everyday brain boost.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil):** Not just good for your heart! EPA and DHA, found in fish oil, are crucial building blocks for brain cells and support overall cognitive function.
* **Creatine:** Yes, the same stuff athletes use! Creatine helps provide energy to your cells, including brain cells, which can improve short-term memory and reasoning.
* **Rhodiola Rosea:** This is an adaptogen, meaning it helps your body adapt to stress. It can reduce fatigue and improve mental performance during stressful times.
* **Bacopa Monnieri:** An ancient Ayurvedic herb known for its memory-enhancing properties, especially with consistent, long-term use.

### Important Considerations Before You Dive In

Before you try anything new, remember these golden rules:

* **Start Low, Go Slow:** This is probably the most important piece of advice. Begin with the lowest recommended dose and gradually increase it if needed. Your body needs time to adjust.
* **Research is Key:** Don't just take my word for it - or anyone else's! Look up the specific nootropic you're interested in. Understand its common uses, potential side effects, and recommended dosages.
* **Consult a Professional:** If you have any underlying health conditions, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or are taking other medications, please talk to your doctor before trying any new supplement. Your health always comes first.
* **Lifestyle Matters Most:** Nootropics aren't magic pills that let you skip sleep, eat junk food, or avoid exercise. They *support* a healthy lifestyle; they don't replace it. Prioritize good sleep, a balanced diet, and regular physical activity.
* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a simple journal. Note what you take, the dosage, and how you feel mentally. This helps you figure out what works best for *your* unique brain.

## Building Your Brain-Boosting Stack (The Beginner's Way)

A ""stack"" is simply a combination of nootropics taken together for a synergistic effect. For beginners, keep it simple. My suggestion for a gentle, effective starter stack would be:

1. **Caffeine + L-Theanine:** For immediate focus and calm alertness.
2. **Omega-3 Fish Oil:** For long-term brain health and foundational support.
3. **One Adaptogen (like Rhodiola Rosea):** To help manage stress and improve mental resilience.

Start with one, see how you feel, then slowly introduce another. Don't try to take everything at once. It's about finding what helps *you* feel more focused, clear, and ready to tackle your day.

## Ready to Enhance Your Brain Power?

Exploring nootropics can be a fascinating journey into optimizing your mental performance. Remember, it's not about becoming a genius overnight, but about giving your brain the support it needs to function at its best. Start with the basics, do your research, prioritize your lifestyle, and listen to your body.

Your brain is an incredible organ, and with a little care and the right tools, you can unlock its full potential. Happy thinking!",1,1750014097.0,NootropicWisdom,0,1.0,False

1lc82i8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lc82i8,Comprehensive Conrad Review + Construction Update,"**6 Night Stay at Bora Bora Conrad Late May/Early June 2025:**

I wanted to share my experience of the Conrad Bora Bora as a whole as well as some perspective on how the construction would impact one's stay.

I will cover:

1. Construction visibility and noise
2. Best bungalow locations overall and based on construction
3. Food & drink quality
4. Spa quality
5. Snorkeling and overall enjoyment of the water
6. Room quality
7. Service quality
8. Ease of getting to/from Vaitape
9. Food and drink prices
10. Randomness

**1.) Construction Visibility & Noise 7/10**

We stayed as far away from the construction as possible in an OWB w/o a pool. I highly recommend staying in this area because you see and hear nothing. Bonus is that you also have a sunset view and can see the top of Mt Otemanu, which my photos will reflect.

*(I know that some people don't think that a high-end spot is worth it if you can't see Mt Otemanu and we took this into consideration when choosing our resort.  We chose Conrad - pre construction announcement - because of the opportunity to get a bungalow that does not look out on any other bungalows.  Many of the bungalows where StR, FS, etc. are look out at Mt Otemanu but also look out on other bungalow operations.  I think that it is a matter of preference.  Conrad does have Mt Otemanu bungalows normally but those are under construction so the entire section is shut down)*

You¬†*can see*¬†the construction from some of the bungalows and you can see it from Upa Upa (lounge and sushi bar) and from breakfast/Iriatae restaurant. I only really¬†*heard*¬†the construction a couple of times at breakfast and while the eyes cannot help but notice the barge, it is at least freshly painted and not completely obnoxious.

I did not see the barge from our spa treatment room nor could I hear any noise.

Note: I have seen posts since my stay that state that the construction has become louder.  While we were there it seemed that they were pouring the concrete for the plunge pools.  Another Redditor said that they were cutting the decks to install the pools when they were there and that it was very loud.  Seems like noise levels are quite varied but it did not impact our trip as well 

**2.) Best Bungalow Locations Overall and Based on Construction**

There is a plus side to this construction - less people! This resort can hold about 280ppl and there are only 140ppl here with the large section of bungalows that are closed.

While there are no direct Mt Otemanu view bungalows available during construction, if you book in the 320s/330s facing¬†*away*¬†from the main resort, you can see the top of the mountain and you can see sunset + the water is super calm and the reefs are literally right below you.

All other bungalows and villas would have some visibility of the barge although the ones that are furthest to the right when looking out from the resort are definitely more obstructed than the cluster that is just to the right of center when looking out to the water from the resort.

I highly recommend that you lobby for a bungalow that is as far west as possible and west facing. They have ones with and without pools. I opted for no pool because I would not use it when I have the ocean right underneath me. Maybe a remnant of spending a ton of time in a chlorine filled pool growing up in Phoenix :)

**3.) Food Quality - 7/10**

This one is a mixed bag, to be honest.

The patisserie at breakfast is heavenly. This morning they had a cruffin and it was quite literally to die for. Cooked to order items have also been very good and are included if breakfast is included.  

The only downvote for breakfast is the coffee.  Every day we ordered a soy milk (no oat milk available) flat white and every day it was too hot to even think about drinking.  I get it, the staff are not baristas but at the same time, an operation of this caliber could have a temperature gauge so that you can drink your coffee within 15 minutes of it arriving.  

Banyan was quite yummy although plate presentation could have been better. The meat was very tender and the noodles we ordered were well seasoned and well-cooked. The vibes were kinda meh but it worked as a place to have dinner.

The buffet at Tamure (maybe spelling that wrong) was good, but not great, on the evening of the show. Overall I thought that the experience was worth it but nothing to write home (or to Reddit) about.

The daytime pool bar/restaurant is mostly good but it is all about what you order. The server recommended we not order the pizza. The bruschetta was not actually bruschetta but was still very good. The chickpea burger was good as well as anything with fish in it. Their french fries are very yummy. The chicken ceasar was a disappointment. The chicken was cooked to an almost inedible level of doneness. Like, so so so chewy. Annoying when you pay $35 for a chicken ceasar but at least they do other dishes well.

Upa Upa was good. The fish was superb. The rice was not perfect but not bad either. I am a sake snob so I did not try their sake but they did have a Junmai on the menu (I prefer Junmai Ginjo at a minimum so I'm not paying a premium for a regular Junmai). Overall this felt like good value. We spent $200 total and each had one premium cocktail.

Drinks are expensive. Like $33+ for a specialty cocktail and I thought that they were mostly just ok. The issue with specialty cocktails in a hot and humid environment is that the ice melts too quickly and the magic of the multiple flavors combined is quickly diluted, literally and figuratively.

As you can see in my photos, we brought a bar with us, including a jigger, muddler, stirring spoon, and our own mini cans of Fever Tree. I can't recommend this enough! Their Fever Tree is $15/bottle! The two boxes of small cans traveled so easily! Even with our entire bar we only ended up paying $50 in baggage overages on our way out here!

If you do order drinks from their bars, your best bet is simple stuff like beer, G&T or vodka and soda. Those are much more reasonable. They had some nice rums that you could sip neat as well that were priced ok. Wine is not too expensive either but we wanted to bring some really good stuff so we brought our own.

**4.) Spa Quality - 10/10**

Excellent treatments. Excellent service. Excellent rooms. Getting ready to head over for my third visit to the spa as I type this!

Day 1 I had a foot massage. Day 3 we did the Fenua treatment + jacuzzi with champagne after. They even upgraded us from a 375ml bottle to a 750ml bottle just because. Day 5 is a couple's 90 min Balinese massage.

I think that the prices are completely reasonable considering quality of service, the spaces, etc.

**5.) Snorkeling and Overall Enjoyment of the Water - 10/10**

This part is incredible IMO. I have never enjoyed snorkeling more than I did here...and I've traveled to at least 50 different islands and over 70 countries in total. Being able to jump off of your deck and see 75+ different fish, corals, etc. is amazing. The fish are plentiful and the water was almost always like a bathtub.

I literally just saw an eagle ray jump out of the water while typing this. Watched some fish do some hunting in the early hours of the morning today. I have loved having repeat snorkel sessions every single day.

We have not left the resort for snorkeling but in hindsight, we wish that we had planned to but it is hard to want to leave when you can just jump off of your deck.

**6.) Room Quality - 10/10**

As other posters have said, these rooms are modern and beautiful. The bathroom is to die for. You can open your windows and enjoy the sea views from the bath (but beware that on the rare occasion that someone walks down the path between bungalows, they can see you). The tub is in the middle with the toilet to the left and shower to the right. Excellent toiletries and a very nice blow dryer.

The bed is incredibly comfortable. Goodness I love me a Conrad bed! The closet it spacious and has a door so that you can keep all of your clothes and whatnot put away for a tidy room. There are two separate sitting areas inside so plenty of room to lounge during the hottest part of the day.

The nets on the deck are fantastic for sunset! We took the back pillow from the chair and used it to lean against for sunset cocktails every day.

The room is modern and just very tastefully appointed. They provide plenty of towels for pool/ocean time as well as the shower.

The temperature is ideal for a good night's sleep and is cool and refreshing when coming in from the heat of the outdoors.

The modernity of the room and what I heard about the patisserie are what sold me on the Conrad over StR.

The views here were stunning. Having a sunset view, a lagoon below me, and views of the top of Mt Otemanu was absolutely perfect. You see other bungalows, of course, but it still feels private.

**7.) Service Quality - 9/10**

Overall, the service has been fantastic. The staff was a pleasure to work with in organizing our itinerary, dining reservations on and off property, spa appointments, etc.

Upon arrival at the airport we approached the Conrad booth and were given a flower necklace (a lei?) by the gentleman at the counter. He was very pleasant and the boat was awaiting our arrival. One small miss here is that nobody accompanies us to the baggage area to help gather our luggage. On one hand, this makes sense to me because the area is small...but at a 5 star operation I would expect an offer to be made to help. Now, once the luggage was retrieved by us and rolled over to the Conrad booth, they did take our luggage and put it on the boat.

The boat was very nice and comfortable and we had it all to ourselves. Another small miss was not having cold water, sparkling water, juice, (maybe even a Hinano ;)) on the boat for us to enjoy during our 20ish minute ride to the resort. While checkin doesn't technically start until you reach the dock of the resort, the experience starts as soon as you engage with the staff.

Upon arriving everything was perfection. Penelope was awaiting us on the dock and we were greeted by a man playing ""happy birthday"" on the ukulele since it was my wife's 40th birthday. This was a very nice touch. Checkin was smooth, fast, and easy. The welcome juice was yummy (surprised that an option w/ alcohol was not offered but that is ok) and after we had a short chat and provided our credit card for incidentals, we were off for our resort tour via golf cart. The tour was just the right amount of time and was very helpful in getting oriented.

We were shown around our room and that part was very pleasant as well. We were provided were a menu of options for incense at turndown which I also liked!

For my wife's birthday (we are Hilton Diamond members) we were provided with a 750ml bottle of extra brut champagne (they sell is for about $175 at the resort and it retails for about $60 online), a delicious and sizable cake (delicious and had a candle), a bar of dark chocolate and a personalized printed note wishing my wife a happy birthday. That was a fabulous start to our stay at the Conrad.

The cleaning and turndown service was fantastic - we told the cleaner the very first day which Nespresso pods we preferred and that we prefer cane sugar over white sugar. Every day after that, at cleaning and turndown time, the pods we like were replenished as well as the sugar. Small touches like notes, swan shaped towels, etc. were left for us. They did a great job tidying the room. Every time we requested something it was brought to the room swiftly and they paid attention to small details like not taking away the wine glasses we requested on day one for our own wine. They cleaned them daily and left them by the minibar.

One night we went into town to have dinner and the taxi provided by the restaurant was not there on time (was like 30 min late!) to bring us back for the water taxi back to the resort. The Conrad waited for us and texted with us to not stress about it at all. That was very kind because the taxi is the responsibility of the restaurant, not the Conrad.

The¬†*only*¬†miss in customer service was following our last spa treatment. My wife and I had both gone to the spa for a 90 minute couples massage so between getting to the spa, getting the massage, getting dressed, having our tea post massage, etc. they had over 2 hours that they knew both of us would not be in the room. We came back to a room (after noon) that had yet to be cleaned. This meant that we walked into an untidy room after a wonderful massage and had not had our water replenished. This is the only reason I am not giving service a 10/10.

**8.) Ease of Getting To/From Vaitape - 10/10**

I have already covered this one but they make it very easy.

You can go for free to Vaitape at 8am or 1:15pm. You can come back for free at 12:30pm or 4:30pm.

If you want to head over there for dinner then you can do it at 6pm and come back at 9pm and it is $60pp RT.

The ride is short, smooth, and beautiful!

**9.) Food and Drink Prices - 8/10**

I have already covered this but I will summarize here:

* Food prices are pretty reasonable, for the most part, considering you are at a 5\* resort in the middle of nowhere in the Pacific.
* Drink prices are fine if your order simple things like gin and tonic (but not with Fever Tree, they want $15 for that alone!)
* Cocktail prices are outrageous, IMO, considering how quickly the ice melts and they become diluted. The only time it is worth it is at dinner because the ice does not melt as fast since the temps are a little bit cooler.
* As stated above and seen in my photos, bring a minibar of your own :) I 110% am so happy that I did! I am a picky person when it comes to drinks so I would not have loved their options and it saved me several hundred dollars, which I reallocated to a ton of spa treatments :)

**10.) Randomness ÔøΩ**ÔøΩ

The Friday night dance show was fun. Love that it is not like Hawaii with hard bodies only. More authentic and body positive IMO.

Eat at Villa Mahana and the Yacht Club! Villa Mahana has a tasting menu with a wine pairing. It was divine but a LOT of food! Don't eat it all if you don't want to be very uncomfortable. LOL Yacht Club was just something different - the pork was good! I'd had a ton of fish at that point so fun to try something new.

St James was also amazing! Fantastic food (the Mahi Mahi slow cooked with mashed cassava and a coconut milk chorizo foam sauce was to die for), great wine selection, awesome vibes, and lots of fun sea life to observe from the dock, such as sea turtles, manta rays, etc..

Bloody Mary's is supposed to be good but they are temporarily closed for renovations

At the Conrad, eat at at the tables by the pool that are surrounded by water - it is a fun experience. 

Regardless of where your room is, snorkel by the Kardashian casa üòÖ and see if you can be the one to find Kim's diamond üíéüòÇ. The snorkeling over there is also really, really good. Like 100s of fish around you at once good!",9,1750013963.0,chubbytravel,3,0.91,False

-MMORPG, ARPG (e.g. World of Warcraft, Path of Exile), maybe some indie games on steam. Playable on average settings, hoping 60 fps. If I can get better as part of the package, that'd be nice.  Most of (if not all) of my gaming will be done on desktop, so I'm willing to compromise.

*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

-Keyboard and touchpad quality would be nice.  Solid speakers also a plus. Web cam and mic quality not as important. Touch screen not important.  

USB-A and headphone jack would be nice. SD card reader not important.

Initial access to the voting machines in some cases had limited court authorization, but other times was completely unauthorized and was secretly done with the help of partisan elected county officials and GOP leaders.

In Coffee County, Georgia, election officials allowed unrestricted access to ""virtually every component of the county voting system, including the central tabulation server and a precinct tabulator"" where they ""went in there and imaged every hard drive of every piece of equipment‚Äù.

A Nevada court allowed ""limited access to ‚Äútesting equipment and programs‚Äù in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.""

[Evidence](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/2023/05/22/cyber-ninja-ceo-doug-logan-faces-criminal-probe-2020-election/70243425007/) later surfaced, however, indicating unfettered access to machines, similar to the machines in Coffee County, Georgia, was obtained.

A judge in the small rural county of Antrim, Michigan granted access to election equipment, but barred the ‚Äúuse, distribution or manipulation of the forensic images and/or other information gleaned from the forensic investigation without further order of this court.‚Äù

Despite the ruling, the hard drives of these machines were copied and the data was later publicized.

A [ballot marking device](https://www.kktv.com/2022/09/02/stolen-voting-machine-bought-ebay/) that was stolen from Colfax Township in Wexford County, Michigan was donated to Goodwill where it was purchased for $7.99. It was then resold on eBay to Harri Hursti, a cybersecurity expert, for $1200. The identify of the original thief is still unknown.

The now defunct company, Cyber Ninjas, led the Republican forensic audit in Arizona. ""It was reported in June 2021 that a [Cyber Ninja subcontractor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Maricopa_County_presidential_ballot_audit) had transported copies of voting systems data to a supposed ""lab"" in Bigfork, Montana. The exact nature of the data and what efforts had been taken to keep it secure was unclear. A CNN reporter traveled to the location listed in property records for the subcontractor and found a cabin in a wooded non-commercial area.""

""In January 2022, Cyber Ninjas announced it was shutting down, as a Maricopa County judge imposed a $50,000 contempt fine on the company for every day it refused to hand over documents (concerning the audit) as it had been ordered to do months earlier.""

In [Fulton County](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/election-deniers-pennsylvania-voting-machine-dispute), Pennsylvania, the 2 Republican members of the 3 member Board of Elections (they also serve as the County Commissioners) allowed unauthorized access to their voting machines, despite a court order barring them from allowing such access. The 2 commissioners along with their attorney have been ordered to pay $1,000,000 to the State over the breach.

Although one of the commissioners lost his re-election bid, the other, a J6'er was re-elected and is currently a County Commissioner and on the Board of Elections.

Although the physical voting machines that had been assessed in most cases were decommisioned or decertified, that does very little to secure future elections.

""[Election security experts](https://freespeechforpeople.org/demanding-federal-action-on-trump-campaigns-efforts-to-copy-and-distribute-voting-system-software/) have warned that the stolen voting software puts future elections at risk. In fact, before the election system breaches were publicly known, Dominion Voting Systems vigorously argued that the distribution of its voting software to biased, partisan entities would cause ‚Äúirreparable damage‚Äù to the ‚Äúelection security interests of the nation.‚Äù And Georgia‚Äôs state Chief Information Officer testified that if potential adversaries obtained voting system software, it would give them a ‚Äúroad map‚Äù to (change) the system.""

Why is this a concern? ""[Malicious software](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/evt07/tech/full_papers/feldman/feldman_html/index.html) running on a single voting machine can steal votes with little risk of detection. The malicious software can modify all of the records, audit logs, and counters kept by the voting machine, so that even careful forensic examination of these records will find nothing amiss. Anyone who has physical access to a voting machine, or to a memory card that will later be inserted into a machine, can install said malicious software using a simple method that takes as little as one minute. In practice, poll workers and others often have unsupervised access to the machines...machines are susceptible to voting-machine viruses - computer viruses that can spread malicious software automatically and invisibly from machine to machine during normal pre- and post-election activity.""

[Douglas W. Jones](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/voting-experts-warn-of-serious-threats-for-2024-from-election-equipment-software-breaches), a computer scientist, was one of 22 experts that penned a letter to federal agencies warning of the dangers associated with access to voting machines. He wrote ""the effects of the various breaches were not limited to the local election offices where they occurred because the voting system software involved is used by many offices across the country.""

""Election technology expert Kevin Skoglund, who also signed the letter, said a federal probe was necessary because many of those involved have not been investigated or been asked to give up their copies of the election software.

‚ÄúEvery software copy that is reclaimed reduces the risks of further distribution, disinformation and harm to the security of future elections,‚Äù Skoglund said. ‚ÄúThere should be consequences for widely sharing parts of our national critical infrastructure or others will be encouraged to repeat these schemes.‚Äù

So what does all this mean? It means that we know for a fact access to voting machines and election software was  obtained. Copies of hard drives, software, and servers were made and distributed. Data extracted from these sources can be re-programmed to alter votes and change the outcome of an election. The program can then infect any voting system running the same build/software version, not just locally but throughout the country.

We know that individuals who were involved in allowing access to voting machines still hold elected positions and oversee county elections.

It's not just a wild theory. It's not some far fetched notion that the outcome of an election could be manipulated. It's fact-based information that supports the statistical anomalies that are surfacing. It's a way to remind yourself that there's merit to the claims of election fraud. It can happen!",100,1750013685.0,somethingiswrong2024,1,0.99,False
1lc7xh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costa/comments/1lc7xh2/exposing_costa/,Exposing Costa,"I've been trying to hold this all back for a while. I've tried to move on. I've tried to accept it. But I can't. I have to get it off my chest, even though it will mean nothing.

I worked at Costa Coffee and started dating one of the BMs at my store. There is no policy against this, just that it can be a conflict of interest. We were always open about our relationship, our manager and the rest of the staff knew from the get go. We live in a small village and the staff is small. 

The trouble began when our manager stepped down and a new manager took over. It's important to know this manager was also informed of our relationship at the earliest opportunity. It soon became clear to all of us that this new manager was a pathological liar. Lying about anything from the illnesses she had, to previous jobs, to forging employee signatures. My partner has the same illness she was claiming to have and it soon became clear she knew nothing about it, my friend also knew of this woman and confirmed that nothing she said was true. All of my other colleuges were willing to tolerate this. Even felt sorry for her. I had once had a very close friend who was also a pathological liar, and although I know not all people with this condition are the same, there were just too many similarities. I did not trust this person.

It soon became clear to me that this new manager was not happy with our relationship. She screenshotted parts of the policy on her phone to show to my partner, but as he said, we had followed the policy. She was informed. There was no more to say on the matter. She let it go. But I suspected, she had NOT let it go. 

I was correct. Me, my partner and my old manager had become tired of her lies. They were constant. Nothing she said could be trusted. Not where she lived. Not what jobs her children had. She even lied about her children dying. One moment she would be telling us a child was fighting in Ukraine, the next she was talking about her grief that this same child died in a car accident years previously. 

She was on holiday one weekend while I had a job interview. I informed those I was on shift with that I would be coming in later and all was fine. Then, when she came back, she confronted my partner saying that he had authorised me to be paid for the full duration of my shift, despite me being late, and that she had fixed it. This was a complete lie, and other members of staff could also confirm this. However, there is no record to show when that form has been changed. It was her word against ours. My partner thought it was another one of her lies, I knew this was what she had been waiting for.

When the regional manager came on his visit, he wasn't happy with her poor performance. To deflect blame from herself, she accused us of time fraud. It is worth noting, that at this time, my mental health was at rock bottom. I was recovering from a s\*icide attempt, and my manager was well aware of what was happening. Despite this, she told all other members of staff, apart from me and my partner and previous manager, that the regional manager had been informed and that they were not to tell us. As these members of staff had known us for many years, they did inform us. The stress was getting too much for me. I was going to break again. I decided to call the regional manager and talk to him about what was going on. 

I have never experienced such unprofessional behaviour. He screamed at me down the phone saying that I had kept it a secret from him. I tried to explain that I had told both managers and fulfilled my part of the policy. But he would not accept it. I came off the call crying and distraught. This regional manager had had multiple complaints about his behaviour, and to prevent me from speaking out against him, then called my ex manager and threated to get him sacked if I spoke out against him. I quit on the spot, preventing him from using my and my partners relationship as a grounds to sack this individual, and proceeded with my complaint. 

This individual had had multiple complaints about his bullying behaviour. But couldn't act on my relationship as I had left the company. So they waited for the next opportunity. My partner disagreed with a point this manager made, so she said he had become violent towards her. Obviously in an area with no cameras. This regional manager conducted a disciplinary meeting completely against company policy. Ensuring the people involved were not informed beforehand, were not allowed to get any representation, recorded the meeting without their consent, told them if they tried to leave it was an immediately sackable offence (this is one of the things I do have physical proof of). The reasons he came up with for doing this was due to the manager accusing violence, but also because one of them acted 'cocky' and said they did the best coffee. The whole meeting was this regional manager pressuring these staff members to quit. When they refused he ripped up all the paper work. 

Turns out that every shop the current manager has worked at has had people sacked for similar offences. We asked for a CCTV camera in staff only areas and were refused.

The complaint came to nothing. Despite this regional manager receiving multiple complaints for his bullying behaviour. He is still employed within the company.

I would never recommend anyone to work within hospitality, particularly this company. I was told that I would not be believed for speaking out about my experiences. That it was my word against there's. This regional manager also spread lies about me round the company to ensure I would never be believed.

I have never felt so powerless. All I can do is share my experiences and hope one person will listen. ",5,1750013614.0,Costa,6,0.86,False

1lc7uy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lc7uy7/hr_the_woman_in_red/,[HR] The Woman in Red.,"It was about 7AM when Jerry emerged from the depths of sleep. His first thought upon waking was: It‚Äôs Sunday. I have to go to work tomorrow. He didn‚Äôt pay that fact any real attention though. Instead, he rolled around in bed for a bit, trying to fall back asleep. When that didn‚Äôt work, he threw the covers off and got up. Jerry left his bedroom and went straight for the coffee machine -- the one thing he looked forward to in the morning. He made up his coffee the way he liked and sipped it while reading at the dining table. He did this for about half an hour or so, then got up and rinsed his mug in the sink. Next, he planned on pitching the K-Cup into the garbage, but found the bin empty without a bag. It dawned on him that he never replaced the previous one when it filled. He glanced over by the front door and, sure enough, there was the full trash bag leaning beside the door frame. With a quick sigh through his nostrils, Jerry set to work putting a fresh bag in the bin and sliding on his sandals to take the old bag out. 

He locked the door behind him once he was out of his apartment and in the dingy hallway. Stained and bulging ceiling tiles greeted him, and sickly yellow lights lit the corridor. With the brown carpet underfoot, Jerry was always reminded of piss and shit when he had to leave. Which was a pretty apt description for the building he had to live in. But the rent was right and so was the location so... he got what he paid for. Besides, the property managers had just put in a new elevator car, so he no longer had to risk his life taking the old screaming metal death trap or kill himself taking the stairs. Silver linings, Jerry told himself as he descended to the bottom floor.

The basement was another hallway similar in appearance to Jerry‚Äôs own, though instead of aged drywall, it was pitted concrete covered in layer upon layer of white paint. There were two exits on either side of the hall, and both led outside to the parking lot behind the building. Jerry went to the right, passing the laundry room, workout center, and a couple of units. He took note of the silence as he moved, because he felt like he was disturbing it. It may have been early on a Sunday, but usually he‚Äôd hear something walking through the halls. A TV blaring the morning news. People shuffling about as they made breakfast. Quiet conversations between roommates or lovers. Something -- anything -- to break up the dead quiet he now found himself in.

The silence continued on to the rest of the world when Jerry stepped out into the chilly air. A dense fog had rolled in during the night, obscuring everything beyond the edges of the parking lot. Even the sun was surrounded in the haze, giving it an almost cone-like shape with a bright ball at its center. There were maybe a dozen cars parked in the lot, which seemed right to Jerry, but it only added to the question of why he hadn‚Äôt heard a single person stirring inside. With a mental sort of shrug, he weaved between a pair of cars, careful not to knock them with his trash, and made his way toward the dumpster. As it came into view, however, he froze.

There was a leg protruding from inside the dumpster.

It was pale and slim, the exposed part being from the knee down, with a ruby red heel dangling off the toes. It jutted toward the sky like an antenna, the sparkling red of the heel posing as the aircraft signal light. Jerry stared at the thing, mesmerized by its beauty and rooted in place by its implications. His apartment was in the middle of town for God‚Äôs sake, how in the hell had someone dumped a fucking body in the dumpster without anyone seeing? He left his phone upstairs, so he‚Äôd have to go inside to call the cops, but the moment had him so tightly wound he couldn‚Äôt turn away.

Then, the leg twitched. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but it was quick and lumpy, like a dying animal‚Äôs muscle spasms. Slowly, the foot relaxed from its upward point, letting the heel fall back into proper place, and it rolled like someone getting the kinks out after a long day walking. Jerry could hear soft pops and clicks as the heel joint twisted. It rose upward out of the dumpster, higher and higher, until the back of the knee emerged. With almost four feet of calf exposed, the leg bent to place the heel on the ground. Spindly fingers rose from the sides of the box and wrapped around its edges. The finger nails were painted the same ruby red as the heel.

Instinct kicked in for Jerry. He dropped the garbage bag and ran inside. He didn‚Äôt even consider the elevator, opting instead to bolt up the stairs three at a time. By the time he reached his apartment, he was heaving breaths, but managed to grab his phone off the counter. The screen came to life and he dialed 911. As it rang, he moved tentatively over to his patio door, which overlooked the parking lot. He peeked outside and found the dumpster empty. A sight which filled him with equal measures of dread and relief. The phone still rang when he heard the groan of bending metal from below. He felt himself again rooted to the spot as the phone rang on and more metal groaned beneath him, crawling closer. Some short, digital beeps and boops came from the phone, then a robotic voice said:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry, the number you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service.‚Äù

A hand the size of a car tire rose up from beneath Jerry‚Äôs balcony and gripped the metal railing so tightly it bent the bars. The phone slid from his hand and clattered to the floor. Another large hand appeared to his left and grabbed onto the railing as well, followed by the top of a woman‚Äôs head emerging from below. It stopped just as her eyes breasted the balcony. Despite her other distortions, the woman‚Äôs head was entirely normal from what Jerry could see. Her dirty blonde hair hung down heavy and straight, as if soaked, and her emerald green eyes shone. There were no wrinkles on her forehead, and her gaze seemed relaxed. For a few seconds, they just stared at one another. Jerry, feeling out the woman‚Äôs intent, and her, examining him with calm apathy.

The woman‚Äôs head slid below the edge of the balcony again, and her arms became taught as her grip tightened. Before he could register her plan, Jerry watched the gangly woman heft herself over the railing and crash into the patio door. The thick glass wobbled and the frame creaked, but both held fast as the woman pressed herself flat against the door. Jerry stumbled back, almost tripping over the coffee table behind him. He noticed the woman‚Äôs dress, which was the same shade of her heels and nails. Nails that were now scratching the glass like a dog begging to be let back inside. Her breath was hot on the glass, fog forming and disappearing in tune with her ragged breaths.

At first, Jerry just stared in abject shock at the sight. Not even 30 minutes ago, he‚Äôd been waking from a dreamless sleep and dreading the coming work day. A thought which -- now -- seemed silly. His legs maneuvered around the coffee table. His torso twisted in response. His head never turned from the woman, though. His eyes bore into hers. Her once blank expression had been replaced with a puppy-like joy. Her tongue even flopped out and licked the glass. Jerry continued backing away from the door. The woman‚Äôs scratching hands turned to fists, and they started pounding on the glass. Her expression shifted, concern edging out the joy. Jerry reached the front door, ans his left hand scrambled against its metal surface until he found the brass knob. He twisted it slowly, then began pulling the door open.

She balled up one fist and pulled it back from the patio door. It struck with blinding speed and ferocity, leaving a perfectly round hole in the glass. The bloodied hand reached down and unlocked the door.

Jerry broke his gaze and ripped the front door open wide. He leapt through it and slammed it shut behind him as the woman staggered into his apartment. Wasting no time, he sprinted to his left, down the hall towards the opposite end of the building. He reached the door leading to the staircase just as his apartment door flew open, almost breaking off its hinges. He didn‚Äôt wait to see her emerge; he just ran.

The first flight of steps went smooth, but he tripped at the top of the second flight and fell ass over tea kettle to the floor. Pain flared all over his body, but there was no time to wallow in it. Jerry groaned as he pushed himself to his feet and out the exit. The cool morning air felt good on his face, but the fog remained. He stumbled on the sidewalk and had to lean on a streetlight for support. His breaths came long and haggard, as if he‚Äôd just run a marathon. The pain throbbed in every nerve, and his vision began to swim, but he pressed on, heading to his right towards the town square. If anyone was out here, they would be there. At least, he hoped.

It was slow going. His right leg was particularly burning, so he shuffled more than he walked. Not a single person or car passed him on the street. There were no ambient sounds -- not even birdsong. Only his hard breathing and scraping footsteps accompanied Jerry on his journey to the square.

He hadn‚Äôt seen the woman in red since he left his apartment, and he wasn‚Äôt sure if that was a good thing or not. Not seeing her was much scarier, but at least he wasn‚Äôt in any imminent danger.

About 10 minutes later, Jerry found himself in the town square, which was really just a patch of grass with some trees, benches, and walking paths surrounded by small shops. Not a single other person could be seen or heard. With his leg still throbbing, Jerry found the nearest bench and collapsed into it. He was still breathing fast and heavy, but he wasn‚Äôt sucking air through his mouth anymore.

He rubbed his sore leg and leaned back to look skyward with closed eyes. His mind scrambled for ideas, but all it produced was a low buzz like a TV tuned to static. Something might come to him if he listened to it long enough, but Jerry knew he was just grasping at smoke.

A snapping twig from his front pulled Jerry‚Äôs attention back to reality. His head snapped forward, and when his eyes opened he saw her there, holding two halves of a broken stick in her stringy fingers. Her left hand was glittering with shards of glass and dripping blood, but she either didn‚Äôt notice or didn‚Äôt care. Looking at her now, Jerry got a sense of her full height, which was somewhere in the ballpark of 10-12 feet. She was slouching though, so it was hard to be sure. She looked sad, her mouth drooping at the corners. Her previous strength but a ghost in her current demeanor. Those emerald green eyes watched him, and they swam in captured tears.

Jerry reached over with his left hand and patted the seat beside him. ‚ÄúCop a squat.‚Äù

At the sound of his voice, the woman perked up. He patted the seat again. She strode over and stood before him. He patted the seat a third time. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna sit?‚Äù

She dropped the sticks and reached down to grab Jerry under his arms. In spite of her slim form, she hefted him like he weighed nothing. His entire skeleton popped with fresh pain at the movement, but he hardly noticed. She held him out before her like a cat who just had a good lick of something they weren‚Äôt supposed to. Then, she pulled him into a hug.

Time slowed to a crawl in her arms, and Jerry became confused. He considered hugging her back, but struggled with the thought. So instead he just stayed limp like a cheap doll. She snuggled her head into the crook of his neck, and he tensed at the thought of a sudden bite. Ripping flesh and pouring blood would surely follow, but they didn‚Äôt. Instead of an assault on his bloodworks, she sniffed him. Sniffed him. It was a deep inhale, like people do when they think they smell popcorn. She took in his scent for well over 30 seconds, then exhaled long and slow.

Exhaustion settled on Jerry‚Äôs shoulders as she pulled back from him. His eyelids grew heavy and his whole body turned comfortably numb. She placed him down on the bench in a sitting position, then sat down beside him with one arm around his shoulders. Panic rose in his mind, but it was muted, drowned by the contentment which had rolled in.

I‚Äôm dying. The thought came with no frills or excitement. It was a statement of fact.

The woman leaned over and kissed him on the temple, then rested her head on his shoulder. Darkness encroached on the edges of Jerry‚Äôs vision. He fought it for as long as he could; a time which could‚Äôve been measured in seconds. Then, he fell into a big sleep.

1lc7py1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1lc7py1/rubber_band_theory_in_marriage/,Rubber Band Theory in Marriage ?,"I'm 26F married for 8 months to 25M. Our Nikkah has been for 2 years. We're both doctors by profession. My husband is doing his internship while I'm staying at home studying for my residency exam which is in 2 months.

 My husband has been quite distant from me for past few weeks. Though he took me out on a vacation for a day. But I always feel like as if I'm a side accessory in his life and his priority is to hang out with his family and go out alone.
Even on EID holiday, he ditched me and when out with his friends and I got mad and called him back home.

 Though I understand that his routine in Internship year is quite tough and I've spent the Internship year myself too. I can understand how tiring it can be. But that doesn't justify how he stays 4 nights a week away from home. Sometimes on night shift and rest with his friends. Even when he's home, he spends time alone or instead goes out late night to coffee shops. I'm busy studying for my exam. I always take out time to spend time with him. I even sacrifice my study time for him but for him his friends are more important.

He always justify it by saying he's follow ""Rubber Band Theory' of Dr John Gray that he needs some time away from me and home inorder to come back with love. But it's been weeks since it's been this way. 

We hardly have any date nights. And even if I ask him to do something with me that I enjoy, he makes me feel like as if I'm forcing him and that makes me guilty. Instead he takes me to stuff that he enjoys but I don't enjoy participating in that stuff either. 

Between family and friends, he choses friends first nowadays. Though he's a very loving and affectionate person and I love him dearly. But his staying away from me and keep himself busy with friends and staying out late, makes me feel very hurt. 

When he comes home, I know that he'll be home for a short while so I don't complain to him because of the fear that due to annoyance he will leave again. 

AM I OVER-REACTING ?

I need perspective of other married men. Kindly offer some guidance. ",2,1750013066.0,MuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False

1lc7ohr,https://www.reddit.com/r/McminnvilleTN/comments/1lc7ohr/moving_to_mcminnville_tn/,"Moving to McMinnville, TN","I wanted to post this for those that have been interested in moving to the McMinnville area and wanted to know more about the town.

- the town loves their local family stores like cats coffee, DWG, the butcher, oh sugar, but do have larger chains like Walmart, Kroger, bath and body works, Lowe‚Äôs, Scooters, Applebees and so on.

- we have a lot of outdoor recreation, rock island, fall creek fall not too far, Cumberland caverns, the Milner center, several boat launch‚Äôs and a small green way.


- very easy to get around town, hardly any traffic which is awesome if you are from a bigger town/city.

- not a ton to do here but if looking for a quite town this is the place for you.  But if looking to go or work in larger towns Tullahoma is 40 mins away, Cookeville and Murfreesboro are about 50 mins and Nashville and Chattanooga are about 1.5 hours away.

- the downtown has been greatly revitalized and popular to hang out at.  If you like the Hallmark channel it reminds you of those small town scenes.

- the town has lots of events hosted by town which is nice, like the town Christmas lighting.

- welcome new businesses!  The folks that have been here a while love their local stores but will eventually make their way to the new places too.

Unlike towns like Murfreesboro or Nashville, this town is not too full and we welcome new life to this little town.  Understanding that a town needs life to flourish.

1lc7o6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lc7o6o/i_narrate_horror_stories_on_the_internet_but_this/,"I narrate horror stories on the internet. But this time, the story came true.","You don't know me. But perhaps you know my voice.

I'm a narrator. Specifically, I narrate horror stories online. I scour the internet with a raven's eye, searching for gems buried amongst the thousands of short fiction stories posted to places like nosleep and Nightscribe. It's a time-consuming task. Believe me, I've lost entire evenings descending deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole of the worst scenarios a human mind can imagine. There are more stories out there than a single person could read in a lifetime of lightless nights.

I discard many: those that are too amateurish, too derivative, or that are churned out by AI. But if I keep searching, I am rewarded with something truly terrifying, or thought provoking, or emotionally resonant. Perhaps even all three.

I read the story from start to finish. When I reach the end, a smile slowly creeps across my face.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I think to myself. ‚ÄúThis is something I want to share with the world.‚Äù

I message the author, make sure they consent to me telling their tale. They often do.

And at that point, I cease to be myself. I forget about my day job, forget about the pile of unfolded laundry downstairs. I forget that I need to eat or sleep. I turn out the lights and take a seat in front of my computer. I open Audacity and adjust my Shure microphone to the perfect height. I take a deep, steadying breath.

I click record. And I begin to speak.

I become the protagonist of the story. Who I really am no longer matters. I'm just some guy in the dark. Or girl in the dark. It depends on the story. With only my voice, I bring the characters to life, leading them slowly down the path towards their inexorable doom. I pause, record a second take of an especially powerful line. My throat trembles with emotion as the account comes to its cathartic climax. I edit the recording together, add ambience to the mix to enhance the story's atmosphere.

And then it goes online.

All across the world, people listen. Just a few at first, my regular audience. But soon, others drift in, following a link from somewhere else, lured in by the algorithm. They sit at the fringe of the campfire's light as I speak. In their darkened rooms, in their cars, at their places of work, my voice narrates for them a tale of visceral imagination they may never have found by themselves. And just like that, the world becomes, harmlessly, a little darker, and a little more fun.

Harmless, perhaps, until today.

It's a couple days before my weekly upload is due, so I went looking for a story to record. I poured myself a cup of black coffee, opened up tabs to the usual sites, and began my search. I have a simple rule: if a story doesn't grab me within the first minute then I move on to the next. It doesn't take much to grab me: a certain eloquence in the writing style, an interesting hook for the plot, even just a turn of phrase I find appealing.

Some days, I find the right story right away. Other days, like today, nothing seems to stand out. After an hour of scrolling up and down and clicking on every new submission, I still hadn't found anything that held my attention. This happens, sometimes. I have ways of dealing with it.

I could narrate a classic, a creepypasta from the ancient past of 2010. Everyone knows the stories of Jeff the Killer and the No-End House, but they've never heard me tell them. I could write my own story, of course. I do that when time permits. But I didn't think I had that kind of time today.

Or I could check the emergency folder.

This is where I save promising stories that didn't stand out enough to get narrated first time, but still impressed me enough to warrant a second look. The folder is a haphazard jumble of text files, the stories copy-pasted from wherever I found them.

I opened a couple, scanned the first few paragraphs of each. Yes, I remembered why I'd saved these now. They were pretty good. A hiking trip gone wrong, a late-night encounter with a sinister stranger. Well-trodden concepts, sure, but the tale ‚Äì quite literally, in my case ‚Äì is in the telling. Even a story you've heard a hundred times before can be riveting if the details are just right.

I kept going, working my way down the list. And that's when I saw it.

*narrator.txt*.

What was this? My first assumption was a list of saved settings for my microphone, or some other technical detail I hadn't wanted to forget. Evidently, I had forgotten about it. I double-clicked the file, and a window expanded to fill my monitor.

‚ÄúYou don't know me,‚Äù the first line of the story said. ‚ÄúBut perhaps you know my voice.‚Äù

Interesting. It was a story about a narrator. Specifically, one who narrates horror stories online. I hadn't seen many stories like that. The first few paragraphs described the concept of online narration and the community around it quite succinctly. I smiled at the mention of the Shure microphone. That's what everybody uses for this kind of thing. I sipped at my cooling cup of coffee as the eponymous narrator described pouring their own. Whoever had written this clearly had a similar process to my own, right down to the emergency folder full of back-up stories.

I paused when I got to the part about them finding a file named *narrator.txt*.

My first instinct was to look back over my shoulder. I'm not sure why.

My chair creaked loudly as I turned and scanned the deep shadows of my room. There was nobody there. Of course there wasn't. But when I turned back towards my monitor, I couldn't shake the sensation of someone hovering just behind me. I could almost feel their breath on the back of my neck.

This happened sometimes too. As much as I live and breathe horror stories, reading them for hours in the dark could lead to these little bouts of paranoia. When that happened, I usually took a break. So I grabbed my empty coffee cup and headed downstairs to the kitchen.

‚ÄúAlright, mate,‚Äù my housemate said as I entered. He was seated at the counter, replying to a text on his phone. ‚ÄúHow goes the recording?‚Äù

He and I have an understanding that he won't make too much noise on nights when I'm narrating. Truthfully, I don't think he really grasps what I do up in my room. He and I couldn't be any more different, and he couldn't be any less interested in horror. He's more of a sports guy. But he's easy to live with, so we get along just fine.

‚ÄúHaven't started yet,‚Äù I replied, rinsing out my cup. ‚ÄúHaving trouble finding the right story.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, you'll get it, no problem.‚Äù He finished sending his text, stretched and yawned. ‚ÄúYou won't have to worry about me making noise, anyways. I'm off out with the boys in a sec.‚Äù

I busied myself with making a fresh coffee, offered to make him one with a raise of my eyebrows. He shook his head. ‚ÄúNaw, I'm good. If I mix coffee and booze it'll be a long night, know what I mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel you.‚Äù Fresh cup in hand, I headed back towards the stairs. ‚ÄúHave a good night, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù he murmured, already absorbed back in his group chat. I ascended the stairs, entered my room, closed the door behind me, locked it, took a seat back at my desk. The little break had done me good. I no longer felt the indefinable tension that had intruded upon me before.

Not until I read the next few paragraphs of *narrator.txt*.

‚ÄúThis happened sometimes too,‚Äù I read aloud. ‚ÄúAs much as I live and breathe horror stories, reading them for hours in the dark could lead to these little bouts of paranoia.‚Äù My voice began to falter. ‚ÄúWhen that happened, I usually took a break. So I grabbed my empty coffee cup and headed downstairs to the kitchen.‚Äù

I trailed off into silence as I read the next scene, in which the narrator spoke to their housemate while making a fresh cup of coffee. It was the same conversation that I'd just had. Word for word.

This could no longer be a coincidence. A story about a horror narrator could have been about anyone. It's not like I'm the only one out there. But a story that described my every action, every word, even my every thought... how could that be possible?

I rubbed my eyes and thought about it logically. Perhaps someone was pulling a prank on me. My housemate was the most obvious suspect. But he'd never read a horror story in his life, much less written one. And both of us respected the boundaries we'd set when we'd first started living together. We'd never entered each other's rooms without permission. I just couldn't see him doing this.

So what did that leave? Had I written it myself and forgotten about it? Was it a draft of a story I'd started and then abandoned, saved into the wrong folder? That seemed more plausible. But I really had no memory of doing anything like that.

I had an idea. I checked the file's properties to see when it had been saved. Maybe I'd found it online six months ago, forgotten all about it, and was now subconsciously acting out the events of the story as the memory of it slowly resurfaced. Stranger things had happened.

It had been created today. At 20:38.

My eyes slowly travelled to the bottom right of my monitor, where the current time was displayed. It was 20:03.

If my computer was to be believed, this file wouldn't even be created for another half-hour.

I took a swallow of my coffee. It was too hot, but it helped calm my nerves. There had to be a rational explanation for this. I looked back at the text file. There were several more pages of the story left to go. That tension settled across my shoulders again, cold and heavy as December snow.

Two thoughts hit me like a pair of punches, one to the gut and one right between the eyes.

First, what if this story actually was about me? And secondly, what if this story recounted something awful, like my own death? What if, just a scroll of my mouse wheel away, it described some psychopath charging into my room, burying an axe in the back of my skull? Or a horrifying face manifesting in the darkness, its skeletal jaws distending to swallow me whole?

If I read those words, would they come true?

Ridiculous. It seemed ridiculous. In that moment, it also seemed like something that could very conceivably happen.

Seized by a sudden impulse, I scrolled down to the very end of the story. If I was about to die, then I needed to know right now. Otherwise, this tension would kill me.

‚ÄúSkipping to the end of the story won't teach you anything,‚Äù I read. ‚ÄúYou have to become a part of it yourself.‚Äù

That was the final line.

I felt like a novice chess player, hopelessly outmatched by a superior opponent, my every move predicted and turned against me. I scrolled back up, my eyes plucking out random sentences as I went. ‚ÄúThey looked like nothing that words could describe.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey were coming towards the door.‚Äù ‚ÄúI unlocked the door.‚Äù

I finally arrived back at the conversation with my housemate. Or rather, I arrived at the narrator's conversation with their housemate, which coincidentally resembled the conversation I had had with mine.

Fine, then. This story, whatever it was, wanted me to read it from start to finish. So that's exactly what I'd do.

I read about the narrator wrestling with the concept of the story coming true. I read about them scrolling to the end of the story, only to find that final sentence waiting for them like a punchline. I read about them scrolling back up and reading about a narrator wrestling with the concept of the story coming true. I read about that narrator scrolling to the end of the story, only to find that final sentence waiting for them like a punchline.

I saw something about a loud knock at the door, and exhaled a sigh of relief. Without being conscious of it, I'd been holding my breath. But now that something was happening in the story that hadn't happened to me, it proved that the story was just that: a story, a fiction. Maybe I needed to drink less coffee at night. It was making me paranoid.

There was a loud knock at the door.

‚ÄúWho's there?!‚Äù I called, my voice cracking.

There was no response.

My eyes flicked back to the text of the story. The next few lines described the narrator calling ‚ÄúWho's there?!‚Äù and then flicking their eyes back to the text of the story, where they read about the narrator calling ‚ÄúWho's there?!‚Äù and flicking their eyes back to the text of the story.

The next line described them opening the door to investigate.

Stupid idea. Stupid, stupid idea. Hadn't this narrator ever seen a horror movie? What kind of genre fan were they?

I got to my feet, and cautiously approached the door. Stupid or not, there was no way I could go back to reading now. And besides, it was probably just my housemate. Maybe he needed to borrow something before he went out.

I unlocked the door. The hinges squealed as it opened. I'd been meaning to oil them for a while, but hadn't gotten around to it.

There was nobody in the hallway. My eyes bulged as a floorboard creaked around the corner of the corridor, towards my housemate's room. ‚ÄúHey, buddy?‚Äù I called, unable to hide the tinge of fear in my tone. ‚ÄúYou still around?‚Äù

No answer.

‚ÄúCome on, man,‚Äù I continued. My voice sounded small, insubstantial. ‚ÄúThis isn't funny.‚Äù

I shuffled to his room, knocked on the door with a trembling fist. I listened, ear pressed to the grain. Not a sound from within.

I gripped the doorknob, turned it. I gently opened the door. My mind was conjuring all kinds of deformed figures with distorted faces, ready to rush at me, but there was nobody there. After twenty seconds that lasted an eternity, I closed the door again and crept back downstairs. My fight-or-flight response felt like it was jacked up to 200%. I was ready for literally anything, but I had no idea how I'd react if I actually saw it. Would I run? Would I lash out? Or would I simply shut down from sheer terror?

Reading these stories aloud every week was one thing. Being the main character of one was something else entirely.

My housemate's shoes weren't in the foyer. He'd already left the house.

Upstairs, I heard the slam of a closing door.

I knew that, if this were one of the stories I was narrating, I'd be internally screaming at the protagonist to get out of the house. Just go somewhere safe, you idiot. Somewhere public. Be smart. Use your head.

But this actually was a horror story, wasn't it? It was all written down in a text file on my computer upstairs. The final line said that skipping to the end wouldn't teach me anything. That I had to become a part of it myself. It didn't matter if I ran away. It would just be delaying the inevitable. I could leave the house for hours, even days. But these kinds of stories never ended that way, with an easy escape. Sooner or later, I would have to come back and finish it. I would have to accept whatever fate was written there.

My feet felt like they were encased in concrete as I climbed the stairs, as did my heart.

My bedroom door was closed. I knew for a fact I hadn't closed it.

I tentatively tried the handle. It wouldn't turn. Whoever was in there had locked the door.

I don't know why, but I knocked, loudly. My fist was a lead weight strapped to the end of my arm. It felt like it belonged to somebody else.

‚ÄúWho's there?!‚Äù came a muffled cry from inside.

I was too shocked to respond. It was my own voice. It sounded just like it did in my recordings, cracking with emotion as it read the final few lines of a story.

I heard footsteps approaching the door. Fear gripped my throat like a leather-gloved hand. I was convinced that behind that door, just a few inches away, was another me. And I knew that if we made eye contact, even for a second, we'd both lose our minds. This wasn't supposed to be happening.

The other me was unlocking the door. The hinges squealed as it started to open.

As quickly as I could, I ducked around the corner of the corridor, cursing the creak of a floorboard as I did. I opened the door of my housemate's room and slid inside, closing it silently behind me.

‚ÄúHey, buddy?‚Äù I heard from the hallway. ‚ÄúYou still around?‚Äù

It was my own voice again. It sounded small, insubstantial. ‚ÄúCome on, man. This isn't funny.‚Äù

They were coming towards the door. I threw myself to the floor, crawled under the bed, and held my breath. I heard the doorknob turn, the door crack open. I closed my eyes and counted the seconds. Five. Ten. Fifteen. I didn't want to see myself, and I didn't want them to see me. Something awful would happen if we saw each other. I didn't know how I knew that, or what it would be, but I knew it was true.

In many ways, that moment lasted forever. It had no beginning, or end.

Finally, the door closed again, and I heard footsteps descending the stairs.

When I was sure they were gone, I darted back to my own room, slammed the door, locked it again. On my monitor, waiting for me, was *narrator.txt*. My eyes felt huge and white in the darkened room as I took a seat and continued to read. I didn't have much time. The other me would be back any minute now.

I read about the narrator searching their housemate's room, going downstairs, returning upstairs to find their door locked, knocking on the door. My eyes flicked past paragraphs of text describing an endless loop of narrators chasing each other around an empty house. I read about the narrator returning to their computer, their eyes huge and white in the darkened room as they took a seat and continued to read.

Several words from the next paragraph caught my eye, before I had any context for them. ‚ÄúBlood.‚Äù ‚ÄúScream.‚Äù ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù. The words came at me like bullets fired from point-blank range, thudding into my skull. I reeled back from them, my chair skidding across the bedroom floor. My breath burst from my lungs like startled birds exploding out of a tree.

It took intense concentration just to control my hands. I gripped the mouse so hard I heard the plastic casing creak.

I closed *narrator.txt* and deleted it. The mouse clicks echoed in the silent room. I even emptied the Recycle Bin.

I waited for something to happen, but nothing did.

It was over now, right? I couldn't be trapped in a horror story if the story no longer existed.

If this were one of the hundreds of stories I'd narrated, this would be the part where, after a moment of false hope, everything got real bad. Silence filled my room, spreading and thickening like smoke.

I screamed as the knock at the door began again, louder this time. This wasn't a knock for attention. This was a fist pounding against the wood. This was the sound of someone trying to break through. A violent, incessant sound.

How could this be happening? The story didn't even exist any more. I'd deleted it myself, before I'd even finished reading it. And then I remembered.

‚ÄúSkipping to the end of the story won't teach you anything. You have to become a part of it yourself.‚Äù

I looked at the clock. It was 20:10.

There was just enough time. I opened up a text editor and began to type.

‚ÄúYou don't know me,‚Äù I wrote. ‚ÄúBut perhaps you know my voice.‚Äù

The words flowed out of me. From memory, I typed out the story just as I remembered it. The process of finding and narrating horror stories. The discovery of *narrator.txt* in my emergency folder. The conversation with my housemate. Skipping to the end of the story, skipping back. Hearing a knock at the door. Knocking on that same door myself. The words ‚Äúblood‚Äù and ‚Äúscream‚Äù and ‚Äúdeath‚Äù. And then I began to write new words, words I hadn't already seen. I described the deletion of *narrator.txt*. The pounding at the bedroom door. I typed about typing the story again in my own words, which were the same words that it had always been written in.

I wrote about the sentence I am currently writing, a sentence that must always have been a part of the story, even as I see it now for the first time.

I wrote about writing this sentence. And this one. And the next.

This was my story now. And it had always been my story.

Another blow against the door, then another. It sounded like the wood was about to splinter. Like the lock was about to give way. My words hadn't described the assailant. If they actually broke down that door, they would be indescribable. Maybe they looked just like me. Or maybe...

They looked like nothing that words could describe.

I wrote about writing the final lines of the story, even though, as I type this now, I haven't typed them yet. The time was ‚Äì or will be ‚Äì 20:38 when I typed the final line and saved the file as *narrator.txt*.

The most terrifying thing about time travel stories is the tenses.

I opened Audacity and adjusted my Shure microphone to the perfect height. I took a deep, steadying breath.

I clicked record. And I began to speak.

‚ÄúYou don't know me,‚Äù I recited, ‚Äúbut perhaps you know my voice.‚Äù The knocking had finally stopped, because I hadn't described it as ongoing. Silence had settled upon the house once more. Anyone listening to this narration would just hear my voice, and the ambient sound I would add later to enhance the atmosphere.

‚ÄúI'm a narrator.‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúSpecifically, I narrate horror stories online. I scour the internet with a raven's eye, searching for gems buried amongst the thousands of short fiction stories posted to places like nosleep and Nightscribe. It's a time-consuming task.‚Äù Already, I was beginning to lose myself in a story that was about myself and nobody at all, that had been written by myself, and myself, and nobody at all.

Who I really am no longer matters.

I stared into the nylon darkness of my pop shield, and I told a tale as if I were sitting at a campfire, an audience of wide-eyed friends and strangers all around me. I took my time, speaking slowly and carefully. Stories like these are not to be rushed. The soul of them cannot be summarised in a few bullet points. You have to inhabit them. Live in them, just for a little while. I paused, recorded a second take of an especially powerful line. And my throat trembled with emotion as the account came to its cathartic climax.

1lc7m6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1lc7m6x/help_me_understand_anything/,Help me... understand... anything?,"I dont understand myself. F(30) I just had a huge discussion with my partner (we often have HUGE misunderstandings....)

I did the laundry (most of it was his in the washing machine) but im the one who decided to wash and spin it, so he went upstairs after dinner, he may not have realised it was in there. I decided after dinner to hang it up before I forgot about it. So I did, he asked where I was and I shouted up im busy. I decided to do the washing so I wouldn't expect him to help me, as it's a Sunday and it was my choice. I didn't want to bother him with it. And I'd also expect the same from him.. as if i didn't anticipate there was washing and for it to be hung, I wouldn't want to do it last minute and not aware it was a chore for that moment. Anyway he came downstairs saw I was hanging the clothes up, then said I should've told him I need help and he could have assisted. But that wouldn't be fair to expect him to do something he didn't sign up to

And it just made me have a huge reflection. As this morning I wasn't feeling well and in the car with him I said I wanted to go home. Make a coffee, and go upstairs and sit down for 20 mins. When we got home and I went upstairs... he seemed annoyed when he asked me to help him do the dishes and I said no, because at this point I had went upstairs (not feeling great) and tried to have my own moment. I felt guilty at first for saying no to helping him do the dishes but sitting for five minutes I realised I already said to him in the car I needed 20 mins to sit upstairs and have a coffee..  so I couldn't have been in the wrong for saying no to the dishes as he just didn't listen to me in the car when I said I needed a little bit of time alone?

Am I ridiculous? I'm feeling so overwhelmed and exhausted right now... my thoughts aren't rational or normal but they're just my truth... and he seems to be so neurotypical... it shines a spotlight on how neurotic I am .. and that's hard... ",2,1750012801.0,autism,2,1.0,False

1lc7kw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lc7kw1/i_wanted_to_be_a_singer_my_whole_life_the_woman/,"I wanted to be a singer my whole life. The woman who finally taught me how wasn't human, and the price for her lessons was my life.","

My dream was to be a singer. Not just a guy who sings, but a singer. Someone whose voice could stop a room, make people feel something real. It‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve ever wanted. The dream didn‚Äôt come from nowhere. It was a seed planted by my mother when I was a kid. I‚Äôd sing along to the radio in the car, and she‚Äôd turn to me with this genuine, shining smile and say, ‚ÄúYou have a gift. Your voice is special. Don‚Äôt you ever let anyone tell you otherwise.‚Äù

She was the only one who ever said that.

I carried her words like a shield. I went to every open mic night, every local talent show, every cattle-call audition for those big reality singing competitions. And every single time, I failed. Not just failed, but crashed and burned in a way that was almost spectacular in its mediocrity. I never made it past the first stage. The judges‚Äô faces would range from polite boredom to outright pity. They‚Äôd say things like ‚Äúlacks control,‚Äù ‚Äúpitchy in the upper register,‚Äù or the one that always gutted me, ‚Äúnot much of a spark there, son.‚Äù

My mother‚Äôs belief was a powerful force, but reality is a tidal wave. After years of rejection, the dream finally drowned. The shield broke. I gave up. I got a minimum-wage job bussing tables at a greasy diner, found a tiny apartment where the walls were thin enough to hear my neighbors breathe, and resigned myself to a life of quiet desperation. The dream was dead, and the silence it left behind was deafening. I stopped singing altogether. Even humming felt like a betrayal of the person I had failed to become. My world became a dull, colorless hum of fluorescent lights and the clatter of dirty dishes.

That‚Äôs the state I was in when I met her.

It was a Tuesday night, my day off. I couldn‚Äôt stand being in my apartment, so I was just walking, aimlessly, ending up at the city‚Äôs old, slightly neglected waterfront. It was late, close to midnight. A thick fog was rolling in off the water, swallowing the streetlights and muffling the sounds of the city into a distant murmur. I was sitting on a cold, damp bench, staring out at the murky water, feeling about as gray as the fog around me.

And then I heard it.

It started so softly I thought I was imagining it. A single, perfect note, hanging in the damp air like a star. It was a woman‚Äôs voice, but that‚Äôs like saying the sun is a lightbulb. This was something else entirely. It was clearer than crystal, richer than velvet. It wasn't just a sound; it was a feeling. A feeling of warmth in the cold, of light in the fog. The melody was simple, wordless, but it coiled around my soul and squeezed. All the disappointment, all the bitterness I‚Äôd been carrying, just‚Ä¶ melted away. I felt a profound, aching sense of peace, of coming home.

I stood up, a puppet on a string, and followed the sound. It led me down a rickety wooden pier that jutted out into the black water. And there, at the very end, sitting on the edge with her feet dangling just above the dark, swirling waves, was a woman.

The fog swirled around her, but she seemed to be in a pocket of perfect clarity. She had long, dark hair that looked almost black in the gloom, and she was wearing a simple, pale dress that seemed to shimmer. I couldn‚Äôt see her face clearly at first, just her silhouette against the void. She didn't seem to notice me as I approached, her voice soaring in a melody that was both heartbreakingly sad and ecstatically joyful at the same time. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. It was everything I had ever wanted my own voice to be.

I must have made a sound, a choked gasp or a shuffling of my feet, because the singing stopped. The silence that rushed back in was jarring, painful. She turned her head, and for the first time, I saw her face. She was, without exaggeration, the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her features were sharp and elegant, her eyes a startlingly pale shade of green, like sea glass.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I stammered, feeling like a clumsy intruder. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ your voice. I‚Äôve never heard anything like it.‚Äù

A slow, enigmatic smile touched her lips. ‚ÄúSome songs aren‚Äôt meant to be heard by everyone,‚Äù she said. Her speaking voice was just as captivating, low and melodic.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm glad you did,‚Äù I blurted out, desperate to keep her talking. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I used to sing. I wanted to be a singer.‚Äù The words felt pathetic coming out of my mouth.

Her pale eyes studied me, and for a moment, I felt completely transparent, like she could see every failure, every disappointment I‚Äôd ever had. ‚ÄúWanted to?‚Äù she asked, one eyebrow raised slightly. ‚ÄúWhy did you stop?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm no good,‚Äù I said, the admission raw and honest. ‚ÄúI tried. But I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt have it. That thing you have. That magic.‚Äù

She laughed, a sound like wind chimes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not magic,‚Äù she said, patting the spot on the pier next to her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ knowing the right song to sing. Sit.‚Äù

I sat. The old wood was cold and damp beneath me. We talked for hours. Or maybe it was minutes. Time seemed to warp around her. She never told me her name, and I never thought to ask. It didn‚Äôt seem to matter. I told her everything‚Äîabout my mother, the auditions, the diner, the crushing weight of my own mediocrity. She listened with an unnerving intensity, her pale eyes never leaving my face. She, in turn, told me nothing about herself. Where she lived, what she did‚Äîit was all a mystery. She spoke in metaphors, talking about the ""pull of the deep"" and the ""songs the ocean sings to itself."" It should have sounded like nonsense, but coming from her, it felt like profound, ancient wisdom.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt lost it,‚Äù she said, as the first hints of dawn began to gray the eastern sky. ‚ÄúThe voice is still in you. It‚Äôs just trapped. You‚Äôre trying to sing the songs of the land, when your voice is meant for the songs of the sea.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I said, my mind foggy, blissfully empty of everything but her.

‚ÄúLet me teach you,‚Äù she said, her voice a hypnotic whisper. ‚ÄúMeet me here, tomorrow night. I can help you find your real voice.‚Äù

That was the beginning of my descent.

I started meeting her every night at the pier. My life reconfigured itself around these midnight lessons. My job at the diner became an intolerable prison, the hours away from her a gray, agonizing limbo. I called in sick so often I was almost fired. My apartment became just a place to wait until I could see her again. The world outside of our time together seemed flat, dull, and meaningless. Only she was real. Only her voice mattered.

Her lessons were‚Ä¶ strange. We never worked on scales, or breath control, or any of the technical things I‚Äôd struggled with. Instead, she‚Äôd have me close my eyes and just listen. She‚Äôd sing, her voice weaving intricate, impossible melodies that seemed to bypass my ears and sink directly into my bones. She‚Äôd tell me to listen to the rhythm of the waves lapping against the pier, to feel the pull of the tide in my blood.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to push the notes out,‚Äù she‚Äôd murmur, her voice close to my ear. ‚ÄúLet them be pulled from you. The deep is hungry for sound. Just open your throat and let it feed.‚Äù

And under her guidance, something began to change. I started to sing again. The voice that came out of me wasn't the one I remembered. It was stronger, deeper, with a strange, resonant quality I‚Äôd never heard before. It still wasn't perfect, it was often shaky, but it had a newfound power. When I sang with her, our voices intertwining, I felt a dizzying, ecstatic euphoria. It was better than any drug. I was hopelessly, completely addicted to her and the sound we made together.

There were red flags. Looking back, they were screaming at me, but I was too far under her spell to see them.

She would only ever meet me by the water. I once suggested we go for a coffee, somewhere warm, and she just laughed. ‚ÄúThe air on land is too thin,‚Äù she‚Äôd said. ‚ÄúIt stifles the voice.‚Äù

She always smelled of salt and rain, even on dry nights. And something else, a wild, ancient smell like a rocky, windswept beach at low tide. Her skin was always cool to the touch, no matter how closely I sat next to her.

One night, another man, a rough-looking fisherman, stumbled down the pier towards us. His eyes were glazed over, and he walked with a strange, shambling gait. ‚ÄúI heard you,‚Äù he slurred, looking at her with a desperate hunger. ‚ÄúSing it again.‚Äù

She looked at him with utter contempt. ‚ÄúThis song is not for you,‚Äù she said, her voice as cold and sharp as ice. She sang a single, dissonant note, a sound so jarring and ugly it made me flinch. The fisherman cried out as if he‚Äôd been struck, clutching his head and stumbling away, back into the fog. I was so wrapped up in her that I accepted her explanation that he was just a local drunk.

The biggest warning came when I tried to record her. I wanted to capture her voice, to have a piece of her magic with me during the long, gray daylight hours. One night, I subtly turned on the voice recorder app on my phone. She was singing a particularly haunting melody, and I felt a thrill as I imagined listening to it over and over.

Later, back in my apartment, I eagerly put in my headphones and pressed play.

What came out of my phone was not her voice. It was a sound from hell. A chaotic, layered shriek of static, the screech of seagulls, and something that sounded horribly like the screams of drowning men. It was a discordant, terrifying wall of noise. I threw my phone across the room, my heart pounding in my chest. When I finally worked up the nerve to play it again, the recording was just silent. Completely blank.

When I asked her about it the next night, she just smiled that enigmatic smile. ‚ÄúI told you. Some songs aren't meant to be captured. They are meant to be experienced. They are meant to be‚Ä¶ followed.‚Äù

After two months of her nightly tutelage, she told me I was ready.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a place,‚Äù she said, her sea-glass eyes glowing in the moonlight. ‚ÄúA cove, a few miles up the coast. The acoustics are perfect. The water sings back to you there. It‚Äôs where you will give your first real performance. Your debut.‚Äù

A thrill went through me. This was it. Everything had been leading to this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling with anticipation.

The night of my ‚Äúdebut‚Äù was stormy. A raw, angry wind whipped off the ocean, and the waves crashed against the shore with a violent roar. She led me down a treacherous, rocky path to a secluded cove. The place was a natural amphitheater of jagged black rocks, funneling the sound of the storm into a deafening chorus. In the center of the cove, a flat, altar-like rock stood just above the churning, frothing surf.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she said, pointing to the rock. ‚ÄúThat is your stage.‚Äù

The idea of standing on that rock, with the hungry waves crashing just feet away, sent a shiver of primal fear through me. But then she began to hum, and the fear was washed away by the familiar, intoxicating tide of her voice. I waded through the shallow, icy water and pulled myself onto the rock.

She remained on the shore, a silhouette against the storm. And then she began to sing.

This was different. Her voice was no longer gentle or instructive. It was a command. It was raw, naked power. It stripped away my thoughts, my will, my very identity, leaving only the urge to obey. The melody was a whirlpool, pulling me down, and for the first time, I could understand the words she was singing. They weren't words in any language I knew, but I understood their meaning in my soul.

Forget the sun, my love, forget the shore.
The silent, soft, and waiting ocean floor.
Give up the air, the fire, and the earth.
And find in me your true and final birth.
Sink to my arms, where darkness is a kiss.
There is no sweeter tragedy than this.

Her voice commanded me to join her. To sing my final note and step off the rock into the deep, black, churning water. And I wanted to. God, I wanted to. It seemed like the most logical, most beautiful thing in the world. To end my pathetic, failed life and join her in the eternal, perfect song of the sea. My mouth opened, my lungs filled with the salty air, ready to sing my part, to sing my own eulogy.

As I took a breath, a memory surfaced, unbidden. It was a tiny, fragile thing, a flickering candle in the hurricane of her song. It was my mother. Not her words of encouragement, but the memory of her actual voice. She was singing me a lullaby when I was sick with a fever. Her voice was thin, slightly off-key, nothing like the magnificent, perfect instrument of the woman on the shore. It was a simple, human, imperfect sound, full of love and worry.

Hush, little baby, don‚Äôt you cry‚Ä¶

That small, wavering, deeply human sound was an anchor. It was real. It cut through the inhuman perfection of the other song.

And the spell shattered.

The euphoria vanished, replaced by a blast of icy, horrific clarity. I looked at the woman on the shore, and for the first time, I truly saw her. Her beautiful face seemed to ripple, to shift, and for a split second, I saw something else underneath. Something with a mouth that was too wide, filled with teeth like splinters of shell, and eyes that were ancient and cold and utterly without mercy. The beautiful music was gone, replaced by a piercing, compelling shriek that promised only oblivion. I looked down at the churning water, at the jagged, hidden rocks beneath the waves, and I understood.

This wasn‚Äôt a debut. It was a sacrifice. This is how she fed.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I croaked.

The shriek intensified, a sound of pure, frustrated rage. It hammered at my skull, trying to break my will again. I clapped my hands over my ears, turned, and scrambled off the back of the rock, falling hard into the churning, knee-deep water. I stumbled, half-crawling, half-running, back toward the rocky path. Her screams followed me, a physical force that seemed to claw at my back, urging me to turn around, to come back, to finish the song.

I ran. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs gave out, until the only sound was the roar of the storm and the terrified hammering of my own heart.

I‚Äôm back in my apartment now. The sun is up. I‚Äôve barricaded the door, though I know it won‚Äôt do any good if she decides to come for me. My dream is dead forever. I ripped up the old photos of my mother, because seeing her smile made me feel like I had desecrated her memory. The silence I once hated is now my only sanctuary. I can‚Äôt listen to music anymore. Every melody sounds like a pale, pathetic imitation of her song. Every singer sounds like a fool.

I don‚Äôt know what she was. A siren, a demon, something older and stranger. All I know is that she found a lonely, broken man with a foolish dream and promised to fix him. She didn't want to teach me how to sing. She wanted my soul to feed on.

She led me down a treacherous, rocky path to a secluded cove. The place was a natural amphitheater of jagged black rocks, funneling the sound of the storm into a deafening chorus. In the center of the cove, a flat, altar-like rock stood just above the churning, frothing surf.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she said, pointing to the rock. ‚ÄúThat is your stage.‚Äù

The idea of standing on that rock, with the hungry waves crashing just feet away, sent a shiver of primal fear through me. But then she began to hum, and the fear was washed away by the familiar, intoxicating tide of her voice. I waded through the shallow, icy water and pulled myself onto the rock.

She remained on the shore, a silhouette against the storm. And then she began to sing.

This was different. Her voice was no longer gentle or instructive. It was a command. It was raw, naked power. It stripped away my thoughts, my will, my very identity, leaving only the urge to obey. The melody was a whirlpool, pulling me down, and for the first time, I could understand the words she was singing. They weren't words in any language I knew, but I understood their meaning in my soul.

Forget the sun, my love, forget the shore.
The silent, soft, and waiting ocean floor.
Give up the air, the fire, and the earth.
And find in me your true and final birth.
Sink to my arms, where darkness is a kiss.
There is no sweeter tragedy than this.

Her voice commanded me to join her. To sing my final note and step off the rock into the deep, black, churning water. And I wanted to. God, I wanted to. It seemed like the most logical, most beautiful thing in the world. To end my pathetic, failed life and join her in the eternal, perfect song of the sea. My mouth opened, my lungs filled with the salty air, ready to sing my part, to sing my own eulogy.

As I took a breath, a memory surfaced, unbidden. It was a tiny, fragile thing, a flickering candle in the hurricane of her song. It was my mother. Not her words of encouragement, but the memory of her actual voice. She was singing me a lullaby when I was sick with a fever. Her voice was thin, slightly off-key, nothing like the magnificent, perfect instrument of the woman on the shore. It was a simple, human, imperfect sound, full of love and worry.

Hush, little baby, don‚Äôt you cry‚Ä¶

That small, wavering, deeply human sound was an anchor. It was real. It cut through the inhuman perfection of the other song.

And the spell shattered.

The euphoria vanished, replaced by a blast of icy, horrific clarity. I looked at the woman on the shore, and for the first time, I truly saw her. Her beautiful face seemed to ripple, to shift, and for a split second, I saw something else underneath. Something with a mouth that was too wide, filled with teeth like splinters of shell, and eyes that were ancient and cold and utterly without mercy. The beautiful music was gone, replaced by a piercing, compelling shriek that promised only oblivion. I looked down at the churning water, at the jagged, hidden rocks beneath the waves, and I understood.

This wasn‚Äôt a debut. It was a sacrifice. This is how she fed.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I croaked.

The shriek intensified, a sound of pure, frustrated rage. It hammered at my skull, trying to break my will again. I clapped my hands over my ears, turned, and scrambled off the back of the rock, falling hard into the churning, knee-deep water. I stumbled, half-crawling, half-running, back toward the rocky path. Her screams followed me, a physical force that seemed to claw at my back, urging me to turn around, to come back, to finish the song.

I ran. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs gave out, until the only sound was the roar of the storm and the terrified hammering of my own heart.

I‚Äôm back in my apartment now. The sun is up. I‚Äôve barricaded the door, though I know it won‚Äôt do any good if she decides to come for me. My dream is dead forever. I ripped up the old photos of my mother, because seeing her smile made me feel like I had desecrated her memory. The silence I once hated is now my only sanctuary. I can‚Äôt listen to music anymore. Every melody sounds like a pale, pathetic imitation of her song. Every singer sounds like a fool.

I don‚Äôt know what she was. A siren, a demon, something older and stranger. All I know is that she found a lonely, broken man with a foolish dream and promised to fix him. She didn't want to teach me how to sing. She wanted my soul to feed on.

My dream was to be a singer. Not just a guy who sings, but a singer. Someone whose voice could stop a room, make people feel something real. It‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve ever wanted. The dream didn‚Äôt come from nowhere. It was a seed planted by my mother when I was a kid. I‚Äôd sing along to the radio in the car, and she‚Äôd turn to me with this genuine, shining smile and say, ‚ÄúYou have a gift. Your voice is special. Don‚Äôt you ever let anyone tell you otherwise.‚Äù

She was the only one who ever said that.

I carried her words like a shield. I went to every open mic night, every local talent show, every cattle-call audition for those big reality singing competitions. And every single time, I failed. Not just failed, but crashed and burned in a way that was almost spectacular in its mediocrity. I never made it past the first stage. The judges‚Äô faces would range from polite boredom to outright pity. They‚Äôd say things like ‚Äúlacks control,‚Äù ‚Äúpitchy in the upper register,‚Äù or the one that always gutted me, ‚Äúnot much of a spark there, son.‚Äù

My mother‚Äôs belief was a powerful force, but reality is a tidal wave. After years of rejection, the dream finally drowned. The shield broke. I gave up. I got a minimum-wage job bussing tables at a greasy diner, found a tiny apartment where the walls were thin enough to hear my neighbors breathe, and resigned myself to a life of quiet desperation. The dream was dead, and the silence it left behind was deafening. I stopped singing altogether. Even humming felt like a betrayal of the person I had failed to become. My world became a dull, colorless hum of fluorescent lights and the clatter of dirty dishes.

That‚Äôs the state I was in when I met her.

It was a Tuesday night, my day off. I couldn‚Äôt stand being in my apartment, so I was just walking, aimlessly, ending up at the city‚Äôs old, slightly neglected waterfront. It was late, close to midnight. A thick fog was rolling in off the water, swallowing the streetlights and muffling the sounds of the city into a distant murmur. I was sitting on a cold, damp bench, staring out at the murky water, feeling about as gray as the fog around me.

And then I heard it.

It started so softly I thought I was imagining it. A single, perfect note, hanging in the damp air like a star. It was a woman‚Äôs voice, but that‚Äôs like saying the sun is a lightbulb. This was something else entirely. It was clearer than crystal, richer than velvet. It wasn't just a sound; it was a feeling. A feeling of warmth in the cold, of light in the fog. The melody was simple, wordless, but it coiled around my soul and squeezed. All the disappointment, all the bitterness I‚Äôd been carrying, just‚Ä¶ melted away. I felt a profound, aching sense of peace, of coming home.

I stood up, a puppet on a string, and followed the sound. It led me down a rickety wooden pier that jutted out into the black water. And there, at the very end, sitting on the edge with her feet dangling just above the dark, swirling waves, was a woman.

The fog swirled around her, but she seemed to be in a pocket of perfect clarity. She had long, dark hair that looked almost black in the gloom, and she was wearing a simple, pale dress that seemed to shimmer. I couldn‚Äôt see her face clearly at first, just her silhouette against the void. She didn't seem to notice me as I approached, her voice soaring in a melody that was both heartbreakingly sad and ecstatically joyful at the same time. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. It was everything I had ever wanted my own voice to be.

I must have made a sound, a choked gasp or a shuffling of my feet, because the singing stopped. The silence that rushed back in was jarring, painful. She turned her head, and for the first time, I saw her face. She was, without exaggeration, the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her features were sharp and elegant, her eyes a startlingly pale shade of green, like sea glass.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I stammered, feeling like a clumsy intruder. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ your voice. I‚Äôve never heard anything like it.‚Äù

A slow, enigmatic smile touched her lips. ‚ÄúSome songs aren‚Äôt meant to be heard by everyone,‚Äù she said. Her speaking voice was just as captivating, low and melodic.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm glad you did,‚Äù I blurted out, desperate to keep her talking. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I used to sing. I wanted to be a singer.‚Äù The words felt pathetic coming out of my mouth.

Her pale eyes studied me, and for a moment, I felt completely transparent, like she could see every failure, every disappointment I‚Äôd ever had. ‚ÄúWanted to?‚Äù she asked, one eyebrow raised slightly. ‚ÄúWhy did you stop?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm no good,‚Äù I said, the admission raw and honest. ‚ÄúI tried. But I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt have it. That thing you have. That magic.‚Äù

She laughed, a sound like wind chimes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not magic,‚Äù she said, patting the spot on the pier next to her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ knowing the right song to sing. Sit.‚Äù

I sat. The old wood was cold and damp beneath me. We talked for hours. Or maybe it was minutes. Time seemed to warp around her. She never told me her name, and I never thought to ask. It didn‚Äôt seem to matter. I told her everything‚Äîabout my mother, the auditions, the diner, the crushing weight of my own mediocrity. She listened with an unnerving intensity, her pale eyes never leaving my face. She, in turn, told me nothing about herself. Where she lived, what she did‚Äîit was all a mystery. She spoke in metaphors, talking about the ""pull of the deep"" and the ""songs the ocean sings to itself."" It should have sounded like nonsense, but coming from her, it felt like profound, ancient wisdom.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt lost it,‚Äù she said, as the first hints of dawn began to gray the eastern sky. ‚ÄúThe voice is still in you. It‚Äôs just trapped. You‚Äôre trying to sing the songs of the land, when your voice is meant for the songs of the sea.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I said, my mind foggy, blissfully empty of everything but her.

‚ÄúLet me teach you,‚Äù she said, her voice a hypnotic whisper. ‚ÄúMeet me here, tomorrow night. I can help you find your real voice.‚Äù

That was the beginning of my descent.

I started meeting her every night at the pier. My life reconfigured itself around these midnight lessons. My job at the diner became an intolerable prison, the hours away from her a gray, agonizing limbo. I called in sick so often I was almost fired. My apartment became just a place to wait until I could see her again. The world outside of our time together seemed flat, dull, and meaningless. Only she was real. Only her voice mattered.

Her lessons were‚Ä¶ strange. We never worked on scales, or breath control, or any of the technical things I‚Äôd struggled with. Instead, she‚Äôd have me close my eyes and just listen. She‚Äôd sing, her voice weaving intricate, impossible melodies that seemed to bypass my ears and sink directly into my bones. She‚Äôd tell me to listen to the rhythm of the waves lapping against the pier, to feel the pull of the tide in my blood.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to push the notes out,‚Äù she‚Äôd murmur, her voice close to my ear. ‚ÄúLet them be pulled from you. The deep is hungry for sound. Just open your throat and let it feed.‚Äù

And under her guidance, something began to change. I started to sing again. The voice that came out of me wasn't the one I remembered. It was stronger, deeper, with a strange, resonant quality I‚Äôd never heard before. It still wasn't perfect, it was often shaky, but it had a newfound power. When I sang with her, our voices intertwining, I felt a dizzying, ecstatic euphoria. It was better than any drug. I was hopelessly, completely addicted to her and the sound we made together.

There were red flags. Looking back, they were screaming at me, but I was too far under her spell to see them.

She would only ever meet me by the water. I once suggested we go for a coffee, somewhere warm, and she just laughed. ‚ÄúThe air on land is too thin,‚Äù she‚Äôd said. ‚ÄúIt stifles the voice.‚Äù

She always smelled of salt and rain, even on dry nights. And something else, a wild, ancient smell like a rocky, windswept beach at low tide. Her skin was always cool to the touch, no matter how closely I sat next to her.

One night, another man, a rough-looking fisherman, stumbled down the pier towards us. His eyes were glazed over, and he walked with a strange, shambling gait. ‚ÄúI heard you,‚Äù he slurred, looking at her with a desperate hunger. ‚ÄúSing it again.‚Äù

She looked at him with utter contempt. ‚ÄúThis song is not for you,‚Äù she said, her voice as cold and sharp as ice. She sang a single, dissonant note, a sound so jarring and ugly it made me flinch. The fisherman cried out as if he‚Äôd been struck, clutching his head and stumbling away, back into the fog. I was so wrapped up in her that I accepted her explanation that he was just a local drunk.

The biggest warning came when I tried to record her. I wanted to capture her voice, to have a piece of her magic with me during the long, gray daylight hours. One night, I subtly turned on the voice recorder app on my phone. She was singing a particularly haunting melody, and I felt a thrill as I imagined listening to it over and over.

Later, back in my apartment, I eagerly put in my headphones and pressed play.

What came out of my phone was not her voice. It was a sound from hell. A chaotic, layered shriek of static, the screech of seagulls, and something that sounded horribly like the screams of drowning men. It was a discordant, terrifying wall of noise. I threw my phone across the room, my heart pounding in my chest. When I finally worked up the nerve to play it again, the recording was just silent. Completely blank.

When I asked her about it the next night, she just smiled that enigmatic smile. ‚ÄúI told you. Some songs aren't meant to be captured. They are meant to be experienced. They are meant to be‚Ä¶ followed.‚Äù

After two months of her nightly tutelage, she told me I was ready.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a place,‚Äù she said, her sea-glass eyes glowing in the moonlight. ‚ÄúA cove, a few miles up the coast. The acoustics are perfect. The water sings back to you there. It‚Äôs where you will give your first real performance. Your debut.‚Äù

A thrill went through me. This was it. Everything had been leading to this. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling with anticipation.

The night of my ‚Äúdebut‚Äù was stormy. A raw, angry wind whipped off the ocean, and the waves crashed against the shore with a violent roar. She led me down a treacherous, rocky path to a secluded cove. The place was a natural amphitheater of jagged black rocks, funneling the sound of the storm into a deafening chorus.

Director: Caye Casas

**Synopsis**: A couple purchases a new coffee table with devastating consequences.

The title of this Spanish film was making the rounds through horror threads and after the third time I saw it come up I decided to give it a go. I had assumed it was about a haunted coffee table perhaps and was ready to lump it in with films about other killer inanimate objects like *Slaxx* or *Killer Sofa*. It was not that at all. People were saying it was the scariest film of the decade or certainly of the year but I did not find it so. Don't get me wrong, when The Thing happens, it is quite shocking and, no doubt, more than a little disturbing. I did not see the story going in the direction it did because, at this point, I thought we were still talking about a haunted table. But the film manages to be more on the dreadful side of things than really scary, and its billing as a horror/comedy has very little basis at all. There is some dark humor in the situation I suppose, but if you're looking for an *Idle Hands* or a *Tucker and Dale* situation, this ain't it. The film is good though, and completely watchable, but I think it would have had greater success as an episode in an serial horror series, where it could lose half an hour. The score is haunting in places and compliments the atmosphere the movie is setting up perfectly. It's well acted. There are some setups and plot lines that don't fully get resolved and I felt like more could have been done in the way of building up the tensions of the situation. The payoff falls a bit flat, though. It's basically an 85 minute flick with a good opening and crazy catalyst scene that then loses momentum until perhaps the last ten minutes. But it is a little fucking crazy for That One Scene. Your jaw will drop. And it may not be for the faint hearted or the squeamish. While I've read of reaction I don't necessarily agree with, I can certainly understand them. Definitely worth a watch but probably overhyped so temper your expectations. Or perhaps I'm just jaded. Try it out.

I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.



I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.



‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶æPublic reviews :



Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, ‚ÄúI would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!‚Äù 

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It‚Äôs simply unbelievable!‚Äù ",1,1750012360.0,KanyeWallpapers,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you‚Äôre serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time ‚Äî think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

According to a report from the Office of Government Ethics, President Donald Trump received over $57 million from his ownership stake in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency platform established last year.

The token called WLFI was only available to **approved investors**.

*Merchandise earnings*

The report details that President Trump earned seven-figure sums from various merchandise ventures, including a watch line and the Save America coffee table book.

*Reported liabilities*

The filing disclosed several liabilities for President Trump, including payments to E. Jean Carroll following her successful lawsuit for sexual abuse and defamation.

Other liabilities included a $15,000 balance on an American Express credit card and mortgage payments for Trump properties such as Trump Plaza and Trump Tower.

The full report was 234 pages long, compared to former President Joe Biden's 11-page disclosure.

Aside from the fact that the rest of us have to pay our mortgage and credit cards and didn't have the privilege of being approved investors, how long before the Office of Government Ethics is disbanded?

More importantly, how is he going to blame this on Biden, Kamala or Obama? Is Hillary still in play for some blame?

1lc7c0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fine-Week6862/comments/1lc7c0t/crumbs/,Crumbs,"Chapter One:  The Ritual


Every morning, I make toast and coffee.  I take my handful of meds and smoke a cigarette, just to function.   It is always two slices.  One I top with cinnamon sugar and butter, the other plain with butter.   This is my ritual- simple, consistent, and it makes me feel safe. There's no one to ask why I butter the toast to the edges, and that's part of the peace. 

 I leave the crumbs.  
Not out of laziness.  
It's for Milo.

Milo is a little white mouse who lives behind the radiator in my kitchen wall.  I noticed him one morning in February.  My toast crust fell on the floor, it made a tiny tick noise when it landed. I bent down to pick it up and saw him‚Äîfur like cotton, two tiny black eyes like pinheads. He was as still as a held breath, and I was surprised he didn‚Äôt run away.‚Äù
 It appeared that he was sizing me up.  He snatched the crust and looked at me like we were negotiating something. 

Now it's a routine.   I make toast, I sit, I sip coffee, and eventually- Milo appears.  Milo doesn't skitter like other mice.  He strolls.  Calm, Confident.  He sniffs around the baseboards, collects the morning‚Äôs offering, and disappears without a fuss.

I talk to him sometimes.

Nothing deep.  Just whatever is rattling in my brain.  The weather, some useless trivia.  This morning it was ‚Äú did you know that snails have around 14,000 teeth?  Milo didn't react, He never does.  He paused by the cinnamon sugar crust, stuffed it in his mouth and chewed.  No rush.

That's what I like about him

He never asks me to explain myself.  Never expect me to be cheerful, or interesting or even likable.  He just shows up, takes what he needs and leaves.  And somehow, in doing that, he gives something back.  A presence, a tiny heartbeat of company in a quiet kitchen.  It's not much.  But it's enough.  





Chapter Two: Rainy Day

It was raining hard this morning.  The kind of rain that starts before you wake up and feels like it's been raining forever.  Like the sky has forgotten how to do anything else.

I didn't make toast.  

Didn't want to. 
Didn't feel like going through the motions today.  The coffee was instant, second day in the pjs, and the silence felt a little too loud.

I sat at the kitchen table anyway.

I watched the rain warp the view outside, like reality itself didn't have the energy to even try clarity today.  The house felt heavier when it rained.  I always thought that was just creaky wood and air pressure, but lately I'm not so sure.  I wrapped both hands around my mug- not for warmth, but just to feel grounded. 

I kept glancing at the corner by the radiator.
Just in case
No Milo

No surprise.  I wouldnt come out either If I were him.  He's smart. He only comes when the toast does.  That's the deal.

But, I still watched for him longer than I should have.  I tried not to feel anything about it.  He‚Äôs a mouse.  He doesn‚Äôt owe me consistency.  And I don‚Äôt need him.  That‚Äôs the whole point, right?  I live alone.  I'm good at it. 

The rain kept going.

I thought about the people I used to call on days like this.  Just to say hi.  Just to hear a voice that wasn‚Äôt mine.  
But over time, I could feel that I have become a burden.  I could hear the slight disdain.  
My friends have changed their minds about me. 

 I stopped being the person that I created for them- and that version was the only one they wanted.  

So I stopped calling. 
Not in a dramatic way. No slammed phones. No last texts.  Just stopped. 

Now I talk to Milo.
And today, he didn't come. 



Chapter Three: A Second Slice

The next morning, I made two slices of toast.

I am not sure why.  Habit, maybe.  Or hope.  Or just the empty kind of optimism that sneaks in when you sleep deeply enough to forget how lonely you felt the day before. 

I chose hope.  One slice got butter and cinnamon sugar.  The other just sat there, plain and buttered.

I trimmed the crusts and set them on the cutting board- side by side, like a plate set for two, if the second guest didn't mind eating off the wood.

And then I waited.

I sipped my coffee and side eyed the corner.  I didn't want to fully commit to my choice for hope, just in case I am disappointed by a mouse.

But after a few minutes, I heard it

That soft, familiar sound of tiny claws on tile.  A faint shuffle near the radiator.  Then Milo appeared, calm as ever, like yesterday hadn‚Äôt happened at all. 

Milo sniffed the offerings.  After considering his choices, chose the cinnamon sugar. I guess we both had a taste for small comforts.

‚ÄúYou have taste‚Äù,  I said quietly.

He didn't stop.  Didn't acknowledge me.  But I smiled anyway.
Not because of anything he did.  Just because he showed up.

And that was enough.


Chapter Four: The Gift
I almost stepped on it.
It was just sitting there, near the radiator. A dull glint on the tile, half-hidden under the edge of the cupboard. At first, I thought it was foil.  Maybe something I‚Äôd dropped without noticing. But when I bent down, I knew what it was even before I picked it up.
A charm.
Silver. Half a heart. The kind that comes in a set‚Äîtwo bracelets, two friends, one message split down the middle.
Her‚Äôs said  Forever.
Mine said Together.
I stared at it for a long time. Not because I didn‚Äôt know where it came from, but because I did. A birthday.  A moment when someone promised we‚Äôd never grow apart, right before we did.
I never threw mine out. I just misplaced it. Or maybe I buried it. It‚Äôs hard to say, with things like that.
Milo sat nearby, still as ever.
I looked at him. ‚ÄúWhere did you find this?‚Äù I asked.
He didn‚Äôt answer, of course. Just blinked, then returned to his corner like his job was done.
I held the charm in my hand and felt a familiar pang in my chest‚Äîthat old instinct to explain myself. To reach out. To fix something.
For a second, I imagined texting her.
‚ÄúLook what showed up this morning. Weird, right‚Äù?
I could picture the three dots appearing, then disappearing. That was always her way.
But I didn‚Äôt reach out.
Because here‚Äôs the thing:
I don‚Äôt want the other half back.
I don‚Äôt want to solve the distance.
I used to think that knowing why people leave would help me bring them back.
I‚Äôd study the silences. Rewrite my personality like an essay in red ink.
If I could just be funnier. Quieter. Less tired. Less sad.
More of what they wanted.
But this charm? It‚Äôs not an invitation. It‚Äôs just a piece of something broken that found its way home.
And for once, I didn‚Äôt feel the need to fix it.
I placed it in the small bowl above the sink‚Äîthe one where I keep spare keys and old screws. Not to honor it. Not to forget it. Just to stop pretending it ever mattered.


Chapter Five: The Silence

Milo didnt come the next morning 

Or the one after that.

I made toast anyway.  Trimmed the crusts.  Laid them out like always.  I didn't wait for him-not like before.  I just sat with my coffee, looked out the window, and let the quiet happen. 

He didnt come on the third day either.  Or the fourth

There was a time when that kind of silence would have eaten me alive.  I would‚Äôve taken it personally.  I would‚Äôve started rewriting every moment, every word, trying to figure out what I've done wrong.  Trying to apologize for something I hadn‚Äôt even said.

But not now.

Now I just make toast.

I don‚Äôt know where he has gone.  I imagined a dozen possibilities- maybe he found a better kitchen, one with croissants and children and someone who talks to him in a sing-song voice.  Maybe he‚Äôs nesting.  Maybe he‚Äôs gone for good. 

But I won‚Äôt chase the answers this time.

Because, I know what chasing leads to.  It leads to shape-shifting.  To softness in all the wrong places.  To vanish into the outline of what someone else wants.

And I have done enough of that.

Now, I sit at my kitchen table, coffee in hand, and let myself be.  Whether anyone shows up for it or not. 


Chapter Six:  The Days Without

He didn‚Äôt come the next day.
Or the day after that.

I still made toast.
Trimmed the crusts.  Set them on the cutting board like always.
Not for Milo anymore
Just for the shape it gave the morning.

Eventually, I stopped glancing at the corner.
Not out of bitterness.  Not even acceptance.
It just didn‚Äôt feel necessary.

There‚Äôs a kind of quiet that used to feel sharp.
Lonely, hungry, like absence had teeth.

But now, it‚Äôs different.

Now it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ space.
Room to breathe
Room to stretch out in my own skin without waiting to be seen.

I still talk out loud sometimes.
Not to fill the silence- just to hear myself exist in it.

‚ÄúThis bread‚Äôs gone stale faster than usual.‚Äù I said yesterday.
Nobody laughed.  Nobody offered advice.
And somehow, that felt fine.

I used to think I only had value when someone else reflected it back at me.
Smiles.  Replies.  Applause.  Validation.

Now I‚Äôm learning that I exist even when I‚Äôm unobserved.
That I still count, even when no one‚Äôs keeping score.

I sweep the crumbs into the bin.
Wipe down the counter.
Make tea sometimes, instead of coffee.
Open the windows just because.

And still no Milo.

But I‚Äôve stopped treating his absence like a test.

He is just a mouse
And I am just here.
And both of us are allowed to be where we are. 



Chapter Seven: The Return

He came back on a Thursday.

He just appeared.  No warning.  No ceremony.
One moment, I was wiping crumbs off the board.
The next, there he was- calm as ever.

Milo.

Like he had never been gone.

He sniffed around like usual.  Paused at the corner.  Chose the crust with cinnamon, because of course he did.  No hesitation.  No apology.

I felt something warm and steady pulse through my chest.

Not relief
Not Victory
Just- this again.  Good!

I didn't say much.

I thought about asking where he had been.
I wanted to tell him about all the little imagined stories I‚Äôd built in his absence- cats, better kitchens, a girlfriend. 
I even opened my mouth once.

But I stopped.

Because here is what I know now:
Knowing why someone leaves does not keep them from doing it again.
And chasing reasons never gave me peace_ it just gave me blueprints for how to erase myself.

I used to contort to keep people close.
Shrink my voice.  Sand down my edges.
Make myself easier to love, easier to keep.

But Milo came back to crumbs on a board and a woman who hadn‚Äôt changed herself to earn it.

So I let him eat.
I let him leave again, when he was done.
And I let myself feel glad about it.
No performance.  No questions.
Just a mouse.  A crust.  A Thursday.

And me.
Still here.
Still staying


Chapter Eight: Sunlight and Crumbs
This morning, the sunlight hit the kitchen just right.

Soft. Quiet. No fanfare.
It slid across the tile like it belonged there.  Like I did too.

I opened the blinds.  

I used to keep them half- closed, as if too much light might notice me.
But today, it felt like a kind of welcome.

I made toast.
Of course I did.

Cinnamon Sugar buttered to the edges.
A clean slice, trimmed and placed like a ritual- not to summon anything, but to honor the space I‚Äôve made.

Milo came.

He didn‚Äôt do anything remarkable.
He sniffed. He ate. He left.

And I stayed.

I didn't talk.  I didn't need to.
There was nothing left to say.

The ceramic bowl above the sink caught a glint of light-just enough to remind me the charm was still there.

Together,
Half a heart, one meant to be completed by someone else.
But maybe wholeness was never about who held the other half.
Maybe it was about learning to live with mine-and keep it anyway

So I do.
I keep it.
And I keep me.

1lc7alr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lc7alr/the_honey_of_life_is_joy/,The honey of life is joy,"Benny was the kind of guy you wish you could meet but never do. Everyone has their flaws, everyone gets Angry, everyone lashes out when they're tired, or stressed, or frustrated. But not benny. He was the kind of guy to help the old Lady across the street. He was the kind of guy who would help you move. He was the kind of guy to sit down, listen to all your problems and never complain. He was the kind of guy that, when you bumped into him, would apologise to you. He had the exact opposite of resting Bitch Face. Whenever you saw him, he was always smiling, even when he held a neutral expression his cheeks would curve upwards, he would have a chuckle in his throat, even his eyes seemed to smile somehow. Just seeing him was often enough to brighten your day, it would put a little spring in your step just like he has. He was so nice, it was almost maddening. It seemed unfair, as if God himself had poured all the happiness into him and had nothing left for anyone else. In every way, Benny was the exact opposite of me. 

People who have never experienced depression don't know what it feels like. They think that they can empathize, but they can't. ‚ÄúEveryone gets sad sometimes, so depression is just that, but it lasts longer‚Äù. But they're wrong. Depression is not a rainy day; it is as if there is no sky. Depression is when you eat nothing but toast, because even your favorite food seems to turn into ash in your mouth. I wish depression was like being in pain, like a bone you can reset or a disease that you can cure. But all it is, is unending despair. The only time I felt something even approaching happiness, was when I was unconscious, because i didn't have to think. I didn't have to think about who i am, what the purpose of life is, where im going, what i can do. Nothingness is pure bliss to me. That is why people kill themselves, because nothingness is better than constant Hopelessness.  

I had no rational reason to be depressed. I had loving parents, and thanks to them, i was well off. I could choose to do with my life whatever i wanted, i could study at a high-end university, get a well-paying job, buy a house on the Bahamas, get married, have children, make the world a better place. I could become a police officer, an astronaut, a juggler, anything. Yet i didn't care for any of it. Not for family, friends, a job, money or even drugs. I would drink myself to sleep almost every night, not because i liked the feeling of being drunk, but because i simply wanted to shut off my brain as quickly as possible. I wanted it all to stop. But i had a tiny, painful, agonizing sliver of hope left. A hair thin string holding up my entire world, ready to be cut at a Moments notice. That sliver was benny.  

Whatever secret to happiness benny held, i wanted it. Call me selfish if you like, not that i would care, but i just wanted an end to the ongoing pain that was my life, one way or another. It would either be benny, or a sturdy rope.  

Of course, he agreed to meet me. He was benny after all. I offered to pay for the coffee, but he insisted. No complaints from me. I didn't tell him about how i felt, i didn't want a speech about how life was meaningful, you just have to find it for yourself or whatever Platitude he would give me. I've heard it all before and i simply was tired of it. I wanted his secret, there had to be something, something tangible benny did or had that I didn't, that would save me. So, I asked him straight up. Of course, he asked me if everything was alright, if i had financial troubles, all that. I just brushed it off, and he eventually seemed to get the message and stopped digging, as i expected him to. I just wanted to know his secret. How did he do it? How did he get out of bed every morning, beaming with joy, ready to take on any challenge? I was asking the question, expecting him to give me some kind of generic answer, like how it's all about perspective or some ritual he does, or maybe he's just a Mormon or whatever. But I honestly never would have expected the answer he actually gave me. 

‚ÄúYou don't want to know‚Äù. 

Despite the fact that he had awakened my curiosity, he refused to elaborate any further. He just laughed like he always does, dodging all my questions. But at least i knew that i was right: He had some kind of secret. Something real, something tangible, something that could actually help me. Maybe. And yet he refused to give it to me, and my anger overtook. How could he be so selfish? He was the kind of person to give you all his money if you asked him, wanting nothing in return. And yet he didn't want to give me to one thing i wanted? That i needed? I Started yelling, screaming even, calling him names and slurs, i begged, I pleaded, i didn't care about the looks we got, I just wanted to have it. But all he did was Politely smile, like he always does, he paid the bill, of course giving a huge tip, wished me the best, and he went on his merry way. As much as i hated him in that moment, at least i got something out of the whole ordeal. I knew that i was right. But i also knew, for whatever reason, he was not willing to give it to me. At least not willingly. 

 

We all like to think of ourselves as good people. That we would help people in need, even at our own detriment. That we would dash into the fire to help the crying child. But we always say that when the fire isn't lit. It is incredible what man can do when he has nothing left to lose, throwing away all notions of morality or justice. And why would i care? So what if i went to prison? So what if I got caught? What could they possibly do to me? I had nothing to Lose, and everything to gain. It wasn't difficult to come up with my plan, it took me only a week.  

Everyone knew that benny was home late every Friday, he always helped out in the soup kitchen and always stayed late to make sure even the last person, no matter how rude, was fed. That is when I would strike. Despite his generosity, he was actually fairly wealthy. I think he won the lottery, or maybe some thankful billionaire gave him a lot of money, I never cared to ask. But his house was quite large, large enough to be noticeable, but no so large as to come off as pretentious. Needless to say, it would take me some time to search every room. There was no need to break in, his front door was unlocked. I almost expected to find some kind of altar, something to offset his personality, but his house seemed remarkably unremarkable. Landscape paintings covering the walls, giving it a peaceful Look. The walls were painted in a soothing blueish hue, the furniture was tasteful wood, handcrafted, possibly even by Benny himself. The stairs were elegantly winding up to the second floor. Thats where i would start. I would search this House from top to Bottom, until i got what i needed. I slowly climbed up the Stairs, each step causing an audible creak on the wooden steps. Despite me knowing full well that i was alone, the noise unnerved me to no end. The first door i opened at the top revealed a bedroom, where he must keep some kind of personal belongings. It was awfully plain, so searching it didnt take much time at all. I expected at least some family portraits or maybe a diary, but nothing. Just clothes and Books, and even those being incredibly unremarkable. The other rooms didnt provide much more, a bathroom with basic necessities, a dressing room with inoffensive clothes, an office without much decoration and just some paperwork. Despite his shining personality, his house showed no sign of anything outrageous, it was all very plain and tidy. 

The first floor was not much different. The kitchen was filled with the standard food you would expect in a normal household. Bread, jam, milk and coffee. Again, nothing peculiar sticking out. The living room was the same, a normal couch, a normal TV, nothing that would, in any way shape or form, indicate some kind of sinister secret. The entire house seemed as normal as normal could be, almost suspiciously so. I searched every corner of every room and could find nothing offensive. No secret lover, no hint of children, no weird fetish, nothing either positive or negative. It felt like a cardboard cutout of a home. Despite it being relatively large, i managed to search every room in a short amount of time, i found nothing, not even a hint to his secret. 

The final door i could check was the hidden space under the Staircase. I knew from my Grandmothers Place that old houses would often have hollowed out spaces under the stairs, usually used for storage or sometimes as a bathroom. In this case it was the former. The Vacuum almost hit me in the face as i swung the door open. I threw it to the side and started emptying the room. Brooms, Mops, old Books and Buckets, even an old coat. But none of it was what i was looking for. When i had removed everything, the storage room was empty and dusty. I thought that that couldn't be it, there had to be something I missed, something hidden. I was glad that I was right.  

As I stepped into the room, searching for maybe a hidden button or switch and heard a very satisfying sound. The floor was creaking, not like the stairs due to age, but more like when you step on a thin plank. There was a hollow space under the floor. It was Covered by an old Persian carpet, but that is nothing a boxcutter couldn't solve. As expected, a trapdoor revealed itself, fortified by several heavy locks. Not only was this the only locked door in the house, but who puts several, industrial Locks on an old trapdoor? This had to be it. This is where the secret is hidden. I came prepared of course, my Bolt cutter made short work of the locks, and the door swung open, throwing a wave of Dust into the Air. Whatever was behind this door, Benny hasn't opened it in a long, long time. The steps Leading downwards were old and rotten, creaking more than any other sound I made in the house. So much so, I feared they would break under my weight. Thankfully they didn't, and a huge, empty room showed itself to me. Well, mostly empty. The entire room was the size of the first floor, and completely unilluminated by any kind of light. I brought out my high-power flashlight, I wanted to be prepared for everything. With a flick of a switch, a huge cone of bright light revealed the full depth of the room. Despite its size, it was suffocatingly empty, save for a small shape at the very back of the room. As I got closer, I could start to make out what it was. An Altar. 

It was an old, thick, wooden, dust covered stand, holding up a plate sized tablet made of stone. I started to think that benny was perhaps a satanist or cultist of some kind. That he had conducted some kind of ritual to summon a demon or a spirit that had possessed him. But what kind of demon makes someone nice? Did he have an Ulterior motive? I brushed it off. I didn't believe in magic, or gods, or the supernatural. I always found it to be superstitious nonsense. I wanted to believe it, maybe it would make me happier, but in my rational Brain I just couldn't accept the supernatural. I thought benny was just another crazy guy, somehow deluding himself through rituals to be the perfect Nice guy. But that was not what this was. 

 

Etched into the Stone Tablet was just a simple phrase. It took up the Space of the Whole Tablet, so it was easy enough to read, although the Calligraphical handwriting made it difficult even so. Quickly I deciphered it, just one Phrase 

‚ÄúThe Honey of Life is Joy‚Äù. 

I couldn't have been any more Confused. Was this a mantra? A spell? Maybe a clue to the actual secret? I shone my Flashlight All over it, hoping I had missed something. Maybe a button this time, or at least something that would give me a hint. Bennys Voice startled me and made me swing around as fast as I could. 

‚ÄúI told you that you don't want to know‚Äù 

I shone the flashlight directly into his Face, blinding him. I was expecting him to be angry, to ask me what I was doing here, anything a reasonable human being would do. But he just smiled softly, like a mother who caught their child taking a cookie after being told not to. And like a child I felt embarrassed and flustered. I started stuttering and yammering, trying to come up with some kind of excuse. But all he did was step to the side and say: ‚ÄúI think you should go now. I wanted to ask him what all this was about, why he had this hidden room, why I shouldn't find out about it and most importantly, what that Phrase meant. But something about him, about his demeanor, made me shut up and do as im told. I left the room, benny following closely behind, climbed upwards and came out the same way i came in. As i came out the front door, He said one last thing to me 

‚ÄúSweet dreams‚Äù 

It chilled me to my bones. Was it a threat? Was he going to kill me? But if he had wanted to, he would have done it while we were down there. Could he even Kill someone? Was he that kind of guy? Was it all a lie? I wanted to ask him, but he just quietly shut the door. I didnt want to push my Luck any further.  

I did arrive home Late, but searching the House didnt take as long as i had thought it would. It was 11:36 pm. All i wanted was to go to sleep. But i was still bothered by Bennys last words. Would something happen to me in my sleep? Or was i maybe overthinking things? Was it just benny being benny? Was he just trying to be nice? Maybe he would call the Police, and they would arrest me in the night. That must be it. It wouldnt really matter either way. There is nothing he could do to me that i wouldnt welcome. So, i just peacefully drifted into sleep. 

Something woke me up later on. A noise perhaps, although i couldn't be sure, since i was still half asleep. I peered over to my clock, 2:00 AM. It was pitch-black outside; the only light was the faint shimmer of the stars shining through my window. I held still, waiting for another noise, but it was all quiet in my house. I fell back into my bed, wanting to drift off again, but then i heard it again, and i knew it was real this time. Tapping. Many, quick, tiny taps, coming and going in intervals. The pauses in-between seemed random, but the taps were always in those quick bursts. I started to hear it more clearly, first it came from the first floor, moving further and closer. Then the stairs, more continuous this time, getting closer. Whatever it was, it was moving up the stairs. I Was paralyzed. It couldnt be the police, right? Humans dont sound like that when they move. Another burst of taps, like a quick drumroll. It was getting louder, closer. I could hear my own breathing. I was trying to suppress the noises i made, but it just pierced through the quiet of my room. Another burst. It came closer yet again, now i could hear it front of my bedroom door. And now i could hear another sound. It was a faint buzzing. It too came and went. Then silence again.  

It must have been only a couple of moments, but it felt like a lifetime. Then i heard the tapping again, this time against the door. Whatever it was, it was right on the outside of my bedroom door. Then i heard the clicking of the doorhandle turning, slowly, ever so slowly, like it hadnt quite figured out how it worked. But eventually it did, the door started to swing open. Ad with it being opened, that... thing... started to come into view. I couldnt quite make out what exactly it was, but it was big. As wide as the door itself and half as tall, it stuck to it like glue. Once the door was fully opened, it stopped moving once again. I was just lying there, staring in horror at that thing stuck to the door. Then it moved again, so much more quickly than i expected it to, it Scuttled off the door, onto the floor and towards me, stopping a couple meters away from my bed. It had legs. Many legs. How many i couldnt make out, but i could hear them tapping on the floor as it moved. It had the rough shape of a huge spider, its long, spindly legs curling upwards and then downwards again. You should never be able to hear an insect move. They shouldnt have that much weight. 

 Another burst of movement. It was right in front of my bed. The buzzing was getting louder and more frequent, and now i knew where it came from. It had wings too. Attached to its thick, hairy, black ball of a body were many insectoid wings, quickly flapping their membrane around like a fly or a bee. They started flapping faster, the buzzing getting louder with them. First its Bulbous body lifted off the ground, the legs still attached to the Floor, until those lifted off as well. It hovered a meter above the ground, around the height of my bed, and started moving towards me. I wanted to scream, i wanted to swat it away, but at the same time i was too disgusted to touch it, too paralyzed by fear to move at all. It sat down at the end of my bed, mere centimeters away from my feet. It stopped moving yet again, instead just staring at me. I couldnt count how many eyes it had, some bigger, some smaller, attached seemingly randomly to its M shaped head. Right below attached two enormous, fuzzy fangs. Its eyes were a pitch black, wetly glistening in the faint light. Even though there was no way for me to tell, i knew it was looking at me.  

I had to run. I had to move. I had to do something. I kicked my feet against it, feeling utterly disgusted when my soles touched its slimy, furry ‚ÄúFace‚Äù. I wanted to spring up and run, but it was fast, so much faster than me. In a fraction of a second it crawled on top of me, pinning my arms and legs with its many limbs. It was so heavy, so strong, i squirmed, i buckled, i used more strength than i thought i could possibly have, but i just couldnt move it. Like a stone statue it was on top of me, its pincers on its legs clamping down on me, i could feel the warm blood running down where it pierced my skin. Its face was right above mine, its huge fangs clicking in satisfaction and its eyes staring into my soul. I wanted to scream, but i was too afraid to open my mouth, thinking about God knows what it could put in it. It hindered my breathing, and my struggle became weaker and weaker. It stopped moving, while i kept fighting for my life. Eventually i just gave up, hoping it would kill me rather than... whatever else it might have wanted to do to me. 

 Once i stopped struggling, it started to move its fangs apart, gaping its, i guess you could call it a ‚Äúmouth‚Äù, open. It started buzzing again with its wings in what felt like excitement, like a dog wagging its tail. It was so loud now right in front of me, like a swarm of flies tried to crawl into my ears. I could feel the piss running down my legs. My brain painted me so many, horrifying scenarios. I thought it would scrape my face off my skull, i thought it would tear my limbs off with its strength, i thought it would lay its eggs into my lungs, and once they burst, its many, tiny children would devour me from within. 

But instead... it started crying. Human sounding cries emerged from its face hole. First, it sounded like a baby wailing. Then a cry like a woman as well. A man screaming in pain. More and more cries were added to the chorus of wailing. Louder and louder and louder still, a stadium full of wailing, weeping, moaning and suffocating cries poured down on my, together with its saliva, drenching my chin. Its breath tasted like salt and rotten teeth. It then started to lower its body towards me, its mouth coming closer to my face, the cries getting louder as well. Its fangs clamped the top off my head. Thats when i finally started screaming. I screamed till my lungs started burning, i screamed till i got whoozy, tears streaming down my face, yet it descended towards me with the same pace. Once it was close, i could feel its hairs tickling my forehead, and its maw started enveloping my head. I thought that this would be it. It would eat me alive. I could feel it started to surp on me. And then... darkness.  

 

I Woke up in a trance. I opened my eyes, thinking i might have died. But i was still in my bedroom, unchanged. The light of the sun painted a yellow square on me, warming me gently. Nothing about the room seemed to indicate that what happened last night actually happened. I was drenched in sweat; my throat was still aching and i could smell the sweet and sour reek of dried piss in my bed. But no sign of a spider monster. Even the door was closed again. I started to get up and felt a stinging pain in my limbs. The wounds were still there; the blood was still there. Dried on my arms and legs, but unmistakably blood. Was it a dream? Was it real? If it was a dream, where did the wounds come from? If it was real, where was the monster? Did it just leave? Did it lay its eggs into me after all? 

I wanted to get up and cry after what i experienced last night. I wanted to curse benny, i wanted to storm out the door and confront him, him and his cursed words. But despite what i wanted to feel, i felt only a singular emotion. 

Joy.  

I was happy. I was happier than i have ever been in my entire life. I was smiling from ear to ear. Despite what i really wanted, i had the drive to hug benny. To thank him. The world now seemed brighter, the sun seemed warmer. As i made me a coffee to wake myself up, it tasted sweet. Sweeter than coffee should ever taste. As i put on my shoes, they seemed to fit perfectly, as i opened the door the fresh air felt like the breeze of the ocean. The smells were filling my lungs like a delicious wine, the annoying neighbors felt like family, the bugs were singing me a lullaby as i strode closer to Bennys house. My steps were springy, as if i was weightless, i stopped whenever i could help someone. And once i did, their faces started beaming with a smile as well, as if i was spreading an infectious disease. I had become just like him. I got what i wanted. At a price i wasnt willing to pay. 

I still wanted my answers. I wanted to know what he did to me, how he did it. What was that thing? I wanted to hate him, for the terror i experienced, but even that seemed as distant as a star. I Could feel nothing but love towards him, just like i did towards everyone else. I wanted to scream, but once i opened my mouth, only laughter escaped. I needed an explanation.  

But benny wasnt home. Ringing the doorbell did nohing, no noise came from within the house, and he would never not answer the door. Despite me knowing full well the door was unlocked, it was far too rude to just break in. I rang the door of the Neighbor instead. A sweet, short old lady answered, and she seemed overjoyed to see me, like i was a long-lost son. She invited me in for cookies and tea, me being unable to refuse. We talked about her life, about how her sons rarely visit and her husband has been gone for a long time. I felt pity for her and promised to visit her again next week. I was even planning on bringing her a cake, homemade of course. I remembered the delicious apple pie my mother used to make. I must still have the recipe at home. I had long forgotten my original reason for ringing the doorbell, until Mrs. Weathers asked me why i had. I asked about benny, assuring her that i was an old friend and i wanted to visit him. It pained me deeply to lie to her like that.  

Apparently, he was on his regular Saturday Walk to the graveyard. She had met him there visiting her husband's grave, and they had talked for hours just like we had. He enjoyed the nature and the quiet there, so would often take long walks around. Mrs. Weathers directed me towards it; it was only a ten-minute walk and even told me where Mr. Weathers grave was. I would most likely find him near there, since that is where the most flowers bloomed. Thanking her profusely and apologizing for having to leave so early, i made my way towards the graveyard, of course not without accepting the Cookies she had made for me. Chocolate chip. They were delicious. 

Perhaps it was a ten-Minute Walk for Mrs. Weathers, but for me i arrived far more quickly, even finding the spot she mentioned wasn't very difficult, since the colorful flowers could be spotted from far away. Once i got closer, i could make out the silhouette of a man. It must be benny. I started approaching him behind, confirming quickly that it was him. Once i was almost directly behind him, i started noticing that he was standing in front of a grave.  

It was a wonderful grave, made of pale white stone, fresh flowers potted all around it. In golden letters a name was engraved into it. ‚ÄúIn loving memory of Amanda Teino, Daughter, Wife and forever missed‚Äù. I noticed that she had the same last name as benny. His wife, perhaps? He must have been grieving her, his shoulders twitching up and down as if crying. Thats what i thought at least, until i heard the sound he made. He wasnt crying, he was laughing. Chuckling.  

He must have realized that i was behind him, since he turned around, revealing his ubiquitous smile.

I turned 28 last month and figured it's finally time to open my heart to someone. I‚Äôve spent most of my life in my own imaginative world‚Äîdesigning, dreaming, overthinking, you name it. Never been in a relationship, real or imaginary (yes, that rare breed), simply because I wasn‚Äôt ready. But now? I am.

**A little about me**:
I‚Äôm a designer with 6+ years of experience, and for the past 2 years, I‚Äôve been working independently‚Äîchasing peace of mind and my passion. I‚Äôm a simple Telugu guy who finds joy in good food, great conversations, slow mornings, and soulful sunsets. Filter coffee is my fuel, and spontaneous travel is my therapy.

**Match details**
Religion: Hindu 
Caste : Kapu - I personally don't really bother about mine or partner caste
What i earn: Good enough to have a decent life in tire 1 city and beautiful life in tire 3 city 
Staying with parents : Yes, they prefer me to move out next day of my marriage üòÇ and I am happy to start a new life 
Qualification: Bachelor's in design - Fucking good designer 

**My vibe**:
I love exploring places‚Äîespecially underrated gems‚Äîand prefer staying with locals, soaking in new cultures. (Lived in Uttarakhand for two months just to experience that.) I talk to 3-year-olds and 80-year-youngs with the same curiosity. I cook, click pictures, and recently got serious about fitness too‚Äîso would love a partner with similar health goals.

**What I‚Äôm looking for**:
Someone who's emotionally available, open to sharing a life of adventure, stillness, chaos, and connection. If you‚Äôre someone who values meaningful moments, long conversations, local street food, weekend getaways, and dreamy sunrises‚ÄîI think we‚Äôll get along just fine.

I‚Äôm an extrovert with a sensitive core. Life with me might feel like a 4D movie‚Äîcomplete with drama, laughter, detours, and warm hugs. Just looking for a co-star now.

**Partner details/ looking for**
Religion: Hindu, 
Caste : I personally don't really bother about mine or partner caste, hope you are same too 
Earning: Good enough to support family 
Staying with parents : ones in a week and few days in years, Want somone who can respect them and will have same love for your parents 
Qualification:  Any graduation will work, if you are comfortable can join me and building a cafe, a farm, play school and a kindergarten or day care 

If this resonates, let‚Äôs talk. And if not, thanks for reading and wish me luck!

Love,
28M

I am Anvil Coffee Co, a Canadian Chemist by trade and I‚Äôve been working on a high protein coffee product for gym rats, lifters, and anyone tired of drinking chalky shakes after your morning brew.

Most ‚Äúprotein coffees‚Äù on the market come pre made as a cold brew with added sugar and other stuff you don't want and they taste like garbage. Using my chemistry background and my knowledge of proteins I‚Äôm currently developing one with 20-30g of protein per serving and it is **completely brew-able.** The coffee can be brewed however you like it (French Press, Percolator, Pour over, etc) with no curdling, no weird aftertaste, and real quality coffee flavour.

Right now I‚Äôm doing market research and wanted to ask:

**Would you actually use something like this?**

**What are some aspects you like or don't like?**

Drop any thoughts, brutally honest feedback, or features you‚Äôd want in something like this. Would love your input.

I guess I've hit that point where life's decisions are weighing on me like a ton of bricks. It's funny...I always thought I'd have it all figured out by now. Instead, I find myself sitting here, sipping my over-creamed coffee, and wondering if anyone else is as tangled up inside as I am. 

Recently, I've been stuck between staying in this stable but uninspiring job or diving into a passion project that might not pay off. My heart says 'go for it,' but my brain, annoyingly practical, keeps yelling 'bills, bills, bills!' It's kinda terrifying to think about jumping into the unknown, and yet, here I am, tempted by the idea more often than not. 

I've always admired those who seem effortlessly adventurous, who chase their dreams without a second thought. I wish I could be more like that, but self-doubt keeps sneaking in, whispering things like, 'What if you fail?' I mean, failure is scary, right? But then, is staying where I am any better if it means I'm giving up on something that could make me truly happy? Ugh, I wish these answers were clear, but I guess they rarely are.

So, dear stranger, thanks for letting me ramble. Just typing this out makes the weight feel a bit lighter. Maybe you reading this, wherever you are, makes it all a bit more real too. Who knows, maybe I'll take the leap. Until then, take care, whoever you are.

1lc73ty,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lc73ty,Just got back from Meraviglia Cruise.,"I was a little worried about this line due to the talks about the food and such.  The food was fine, it was comparable to Norwegian in my opinion.  The pizza was banging, very good pizza and always readily available.  

Our room was larger than any other cruise I have been on at a fraction of the cost.  The staff was great and kept the ship clean and tidy.  They had about the same number of events, bands, shows you would find on any other cruise.  The shows were all very similar, mainly a couple dancers, a band, and singers.  Room service always had the room clean when we were around the ship or at the stops.  No areas were too crowded except the buffet, but that‚Äôs always usually the case on any ship.  My only complaint is the coffee had regularly ran out and the ice makers often had no ice.

The kids water park was great, never busy, never any lines for the slides or the rope course.  Surprising it was never busy with how many people are on board.  

They did however re-finish the 2 inside hot tubs at the bamboo pool in which they closed the indoor pool and hot tubs for 2 days during our cruise.  That made the pool deck a little busier since it was the only other pool option other than the tiny adult only pool.

We made it to every port slightly early so the propulsion system seems to have been rectified.  Getting off the ship was quick and easy as well as getting back on.

Ocean Cay is easily the best stop.  Beautiful beaches and well kept island.  They bring the buffet style food to the island so eating is right next to the beaches.  Water is clear and sand is white.  I did have a shark encounter in the lagoon area, a lady asked what it was, guy said it‚Äôs a shark, it was about 8 feet from me.  I got out at that point, lol.  Nobody was bothered by it so that‚Äôs good.  Let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt Royal Caribbeanify the island and make it an add on cost water park.  I have a feeling they will raise their prices once they become as big as the American competition.  Take advantage of the pricing and grab a balcony room at way less than the others.

The Brooklyn port was a little chaotic getting on because of the earlier departure due to the sailboat race going on.  Still get on the ship fairly quick so they did a good job with the turn around of disembarking and embarking.

I would go on another MSC cruise especially because of the price.  It felt very Norwegian to me.  The crowd was good minus some obnoxious drunk people and some kids swearing loudly or screaming in the bamboo pool.  Overall it was a good experience and did not feel like a sub-par cruise line nor did it feel like they were only catering to the European market.  ",6,1750011542.0,MSCCruises,1,0.88,False

Hey, fellow Aithority enthusiasts! üåü Grab your virtual coffee mug, because today we're diving deep into the dynamic world of AI startups and how they're shaking things up for small businesses in 2023! From emerging trends to success stories and challenges, let's explore how AI is becoming every entrepreneur's best friend. ü§ñ

**1. Trends in AI Startups:**
   - **AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS):** AIaaS models are democratizing access to advanced AI tools, enabling businesses of all sizes to harness cutting-edge technology without massive R&D budgets. With platforms like OpenAI and Google Cloud's Vertex AI, creating smart applications is becoming more accessible than ever!
   - **No-Code AI Tools:** Entrepreneurs with little to no technical background can now create powerful AI applications. Platforms like Bubble and Airtable are leading the charge, making it a breeze to integrate AI into business operations without writing a single line of code. üé®

**2. Success Stories:**
   - **UiPath:** This robotic process automation (RPA) startup started small but quickly rose to prominence by offering AI-driven solutions that automate repetitive tasks, saving companies time and money. Their secret sauce? A keen focus on customer feedback and relentless innovation. üöÄ
   - **OpenAI:** Yes, they're the minds behind ChatGPT! Their open approach to AI research and collaboration has set them apart, creating tools that empower businesses globally to reinvent customer interactions and drive productivity.

**3. Challenges:**
   - **Funding and Talent Shortages:** Securing adequate funding remains a hurdle for many startups, as does attracting top AI talent. The competition is fierce, but creativity and a compelling vision can help overcome these barriers. Keep pushing the envelope! üí™
   - **Regulatory Issues:** Navigating the complex web of AI regulations can be daunting. Staying informed and proactive about legal guidelines is crucial for startups aiming for long-term success.

**4. Opportunities:**
   - **AI-Powered Sustainability Solutions:** With the global shift toward sustainability, AI can play a significant role in optimizing resources and reducing waste. There's a world of possibility here for those ready to innovate!
   - **Niche Market Personalization:** Utilizing AI to provide hyper-personalized experiences for niche markets remains largely untapped. Imagine AI that tailors products or services to fit ultra-specific customer needs‚Äîexciting stuff, right? üéØ

So, what's your take, Aithority community? Are there any AI startups or trends you're particularly excited about? Maybe you've encountered challenges or have success stories to share. Let's spark a lively discussion below! üó£Ô∏è

My family and I bought this new coffee machine 3 weeks ago and we are having problems with our first descaling.

My parents tried to descale it, but for some reason the descaling didn't work and they restarted the machine.
Now, when it turns on, it says ‚Äòdescaling interrupted‚Äô and asks to continue descaling with no way to exit the mode.
After pressing ok, it asks to empty the drip tray, then says it's descaling. You hear what I think is the brewer turning on for a second, and a few seconds later, with no water coming out of the dispensers, it loops back to ‚Äòempty drip tray‚Äô.

Do you have any idea why this happens or how to fix it ? 
Thanks a lot :)

I‚Äôm looking for a study group or even just a few people to study with in the Oshawa area. I‚Äôm currently preparing for the Canadian Securities Course (CSC), but honestly, I‚Äôm open to joining any group ‚Äî I just need a quiet and focused environment to study. I find it hard to concentrate at home.

If you‚Äôre a student or working on any kind of certification or course and would like to study together at a library, coffee shop, or any good spot, let me know! We don‚Äôt have to study the same subject ‚Äî just having others around helps with motivation and focus.

Feel free to comment or DM me if interested!",3,1750011310.0,Oshawa,0,0.81,False
