1r99wuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1r99wuc/summon_the_diva/,Summon The Diva!,"A pale white tower jutted out from the lush, emerald lands of the Gekkonid homeworld, looking like a solitary mountain rising from a calm ocean. Its obsidian roofs curved sharply, resembling midnight-black claws reaching toward the soft purple sky of the early evening.

Suddenly, a velvet pillow flew out of a grand window on the third floor, plummeting toward the courtyard below, followed immediately by a piercing scream.

""How dare you!"" shouted Princess Lianna.

Standing in the center of the royal bedroom, Madame Vex, the most senior tailor in the empire, did not so much as flinch. ""I am a woman of culture, Your Highness. And honestly, you may be the princess, but I do not make dresses for promiscuous dregs. You should behave properly, not like the common slum rubble you seem to aspire towards.""

""It's fashion! And it changes, you old hag!"" Lianna shouted at the woman.

""I might be old-fashioned, but at least I have standards,"" the stylist huffed. Without offering a bow, she turned on her heel and walked out, the heavy oak doors slamming shut behind her with a dreadful thud.

The princess sighed, the fight draining out of her. She sagged onto her bed, her mind racing with chaotic thoughts of her upcoming coming-of-age ceremony. With a frustrated growl, she grabbed another pillow and threw it blindly to the side.

""Princess Lianna?"" asked Audrey, one of her handmaidens, stepping tentatively out from the shadows of the dressing screen. The poor girl looked entirely unsure of what to do.

""It's fine, Audrey..."" The princess sighed, rubbing her temples. ""I'm not about to be stopped by the peer pressure from dead people.""

""Uh...?"" Her attendant tilted her head, clearly not following what the princess was talking about.

Princess Lianna was starting to stress-molt. It was an embarrassing biological response. Her emerald-green scales, normally shiny and flawless, were currently dull, patchy, and beginning to flake onto the expensive velvet cushions.

Getting up, she began to pace the length of the massive room, thinking of what she could do to salvage the situation. Her long tail twitched erratically, her adhesive toe-pads sticking and unsticking from the marble floor with agitated, rhythmic thwip-thwip sounds.

""I have no choice... I think I need to call in a fashionista,"" the princess said to nobody in particular.

This caused a collective gasp amongst her attendants, who had been trying their best to blend into the tapestries.

""Princess, please think carefully about this..."" Audrey pleaded, stepping forward with her hands clasped tight. ""Those... those humans are dangerous.""

""What else am I supposed to do? Go to my own coming of age looking like a frex-toad dragged off the pavement?"" The princess retorted. Her large eyes narrowed as she steeled her resolve. ""Get me a Fashion Diva.""

""Your Highness!"" the attendants gasped in unison.

Another maid asked in shock, ""Are you sure that's wise, Your Highness?""

Lianna stood still for a moment, letting the silence stretch. Then, she swiped her arm through the air with absolute authority. ""No! Get me a gay Diva!""

The second she uttered those words, it was utter chaos. Maids yelped in genuine fear, two fainting and falling to the floor like sacks of rock. Another pulled a letter of resignation from seemingly nowhere, placed it on the desk, and ran for her life. The remaining attendants scattered, their frantic whispers echoing down the stone corridors and spreading the terrifying news through the palace faster than a wildfire.

It wasn't long before her father burst into the room, causing the stained-glass doors to rattle in their frames.

""Lianna! What do you think you're doing?!"" he bellowed, yet there was a notable hint of fear in his booming voice. ""Summoning those fashion demons to our domain... Be reasonable, my daughter.""

""I am not wearing another high-collared modesty-tunic! Those things make me look like a wilted kelp stalk! I want to look powerful.""

""Wear the ceremonial armor! Wear power armor! But do not bring them here!"" Zogath pleaded, rushing forward to grab his daughter’s shoulders.

""They are planet-crackers clad in silk and jewels, Lianna! They are the most volatile entities in the known universe! Do you know what happened to the Orion Syndicate? A Diva initiated a trade embargo over a stupid coffee shop and starved them into submission!""

""Vex quit, Father! And what's more, she dared call me a dreg! A promiscuous dreg in my own palace!"" Lianna retorted hotly. ""I won't stand for that!""

Her father sighed, his massive shoulders slumping. ""Darling...""

Rounding on her father, eyes wide with frustration and a glint of tears, Lianna laid her heart bare. ""My twenty-first birthday is exactly one standard galactic month away... and as you know, Father... For a Gekkonid royal, this isn't a mere celebration of age, it's about me stepping onto the stage... it is a formal declaration that I have become an adult.""

It was the moment she would step out from her parents' shadow and present herself to the galaxy as a fully fledged sovereign entity. The stakes were astronomical, especially for high-society women who were judged on their poise and presentation.

The Emperor looked at his daughter's resolve and sighed, a long, rattling sound deep in his chest. ""Do whatever. But I will not be here for that devil. My life and sanity are worth more than some fashion.""

Within the hour, the Emperor had boarded a stealth frigate for a ""highly classified, incredibly urgent diplomatic mission"" three sectors away. Her mother, the Empress, packed three anti-gravity trunks of luggage and left for the northern hemisphere, loudly claiming to her guards that her scales simply could not handle the stress of a human aesthetic critique.

Lianna paced her empty quarters, looking out at the stars. ""Weaklings. They're just words.""
She would come to regret her choice of words very soon.

Three days later, the Diva's ship dropped out of hyperspace. Named the S.S. Haute Couture, the vessel possessed a rose-gold hull that shimmered with an iridescent, pearlescent finish. It was sleek, aerodynamic, and entirely devoid of ugly, exposed weaponry. It flaunted its elegance to the stars, descending toward the royal landing pad without making a single sound.

The landing ramp extended seamlessly. Where a normal ship would release a crude, loud hiss of pressure seals and a cloud of mechanical vapor, this vessel was different. A soft, intoxicating scent of crushed roses and lavender wafted out from the ship's interior, filling the courtyard with an unnatural, perfect springtime aroma.

Two impossibly graceful human female attendants, dressed in flowing silver silk, glided down the ramp. In perfect unison, they rolled out a plush, midnight-blue carpet, gently tossing handfuls of glowing, bioluminescent flower petals that settled softly onto the fabric.

Then, down the ramp strode Emile.
He stopped at the bottom, lowered his frameless black glasses just a fraction of an inch, and surveyed the Gekkonid architecture.

Most intergalactic travel guides would describe the palace as a masterpiece of design, featuring vast, sweeping archways of polished white stone, towering pillars, and enormous terrariums filled with rare, glowing flora. 

Then there was Emile.

""Dreadful,"" Emile murmured. His voice wasn't loud, but it possessed a sharp acoustic quality that carried perfectly across the courtyard. ""Gothic-reptilian-chic. It’s very... prehistoric. Very depressing. But I suppose we can work with it, provided I don't look directly at the molding.""

He snapped his fingers once.

Two massive, heavily muscled male assistants, wearing identical, tailored black suits, walked down the ramp behind him. They carried the heavy, floating luggage trunks. They moved with the silent grace of trained assassins, ready to do the physical labor their master would never stoop to perform.

Over by the courtyard columns, several of Lianna's female Gekkonid attendants peeked out. Audrey clasped her hands over her chest, her scales flushing a deep, embarrassed pink as she watched the stoic, broad-shouldered human men carry the trunks. The two women in silver silk noticed the staring maids and simply offered a polite, knowing smile, entirely used to the effect their colleagues had on local palace staff.

Emile did not wait for an escort. He simply began to walk, entirely taking command of the palace with his sheer presence. Gekkonid royal guards, towering warriors armed with plasma pikes, instinctively pressed their backs against the walls as he passed, sweating beneath their armor. Emile marched through the grand halls, his shoes making sharp clicks on the marble, until he reached Lianna's quarters.

He didn't knock. He just barged through the heavy oak doors.

He paused in the doorway, taking her in... her flaking scales, her slumped posture, the general air of panic.

""Oh, you poor creature,"" Emile said softly, pressing a gloved hand to his chest. ""Stress is an absolute thief. Hydration, immediately.""
One of the hulking male assistants instantly stepped forward, applying a glowing, gel-like face mask to Lianna's snout with terrifying gentleness before stepping back into the shadows.

Lianna nervously handed Emile her datapad. ""My tailor said my design was impossible. She said it was promiscuous and the fabric would collapse.""

Emile took the datapad delicately. He looked at the glowing blue lines of Lianna's dream dress.

""Promiscuous?"" Emile's lip curled in disgust. ""Darling, your former tailor is a pedestrian coward. This isn't promiscuous. This is a weapon. It says, 'I am royalty, and your lineage is irrelevant.' However...""

He zoomed in on the schematics. ""She was right about the physics. If you attempted to walk in this, the dorsal drape would fail instantly.""

""Can you fix it?"" Lianna asked.

""I don't 'fix,' Princess. I elevate,"" Emile stated smoothly. He handed the datapad to his assistant, who wordlessly crushed it and dropped it in a waste bin.

Emile withdrew a sleek stylus and activated a holographic projector. ""We are dropping the neckline. We will use phase-silk, and the fibers will be quantum-locked to each other. They share a localized sub-atomic bond, meaning the fabric will hold its shape perfectly in mid-air without sagging... ""

Emile’s eyes gleamed as his stylus moved rapidly over the hologram. ""Now, for the accessories. I was thinking of a poison hairpin... perhaps a localized EMP woven into a signet ring... or a garrote wire concealed in the hemline...""

""No! No weapons!"" Lianna gasped, waving her hands frantically. ""Fashion Guru Emile, it's a gala! A diplomatic coming-of-age ceremony! I am not assassinating the High Council!""

Emile stopped. He looked at her over the rim of his glasses, his face a mask of profound disappointment. He let out a long, dramatic sigh that conveyed the suffering of a misunderstood artist.

""Fine,"" he muttered. ""No offensive capabilities. But I refuse to let my masterpiece be ruined by a stray plasma bolt from a clumsy assassin. The bodice will be woven with an ablative nano-armor mesh. It absorbs kinetic impact by instantly hardening the sub-atomic structure.""

Lianna just stared at him. Her jaw was slightly slack, and her large eyes were completely glazed over.

Emile paused. He looked at her blank face, then looked at his glowing holographic equations.

""Aaand I lost you..."" Emile sighed again, rubbing the bridge of his nose.

""Right. You are royalty, not an engineer,"" he said, his tone softening. He waved a hand through the hologram. ""Let me translate, Your Highness. The thread is basically magic string. It will stay up exactly where I put it. And the bodice is a bulletproof corset. You will be safe, and more importantly, the dress won't wrinkle if someone shoots you. Make sense?""

Lianna blinked, relief flooding her features. ""Yes. Magic string. Bulletproof. I love it.""

""Excellent. Now, stand up,"" Emile commanded. ""We have a month to rebuild you. Starting with your center of gravity.""
What followed was a grueling, agonizing four weeks. Emile commanded from a plush velvet armchair he had imported from his ship, sipping chilled tea while dictating orders.

The two female attendants in silver silk proved to be masters of their craft. While the muscular men handled the heavy bolts of phase-silk and adjusted the mirrors, the women worked with terrifying precision, pinning the quantum fabric directly against Lianna’s scales without ever once pricking her. 

Audrey and the other Gekkonid maids often hovered near the edges of the room, occasionally trying to offer trays of water or fresh towels. Every time Audrey approached, one of the silent male assistants would smoothly intercept her, taking the tray without a word and leaving the poor maid dizzy and blushing furiously from snout to tail.

But the hardest part wasn't the dress... it was the shoes.

Emile had designed a pair of stilettos carved from a synthetic, transparent diamond-weave. They possessed a heel high and thin enough to demand absolute balance.

""I have adhesive toe-pads!"" Lianna complained on the third day of training, wobbling precariously on the glass-like shoes. ""My species walks flat-footed for a reason! I feel like I'm on stilts on an ice rink!""

""You are not a gecko clinging to a ceiling today, Lianna,"" Emile called out from his chair, tapping a silver riding crop rhythmically against his palm. ""You are gravity's master. Heel, toe, glide. Heel, toe, glide. Do it again.""

By the end of the third week, Emile had her running around the castle in the heels. He would trail behind her, carried effortlessly in his velvet armchair by his two silent giants, tapping his riding crop against the armrest and shouting down the corridors for her to ""glide instead of running like a flat-footed barbarian!""

Day after day, they practiced. She fell. She cursed in ancient Gekkonid dialects. But every time, Emile's sharp critiques forced her back to her feet. He corrected the swing of her hips, the carriage of her shoulders, the exact angle at which she should hold her snout.

Slowly, the terrified girl vanished. Under Emile's exacting guidance, Lianna found her spine. Her emerald scales grew radiant under the meticulous skincare regimens the silver-clad attendants applied.

Finally, the night of the gala arrived.

The Grand Atrium was a breathtaking spectacle. The air was thick with the scent of alien spices and the low hum of intergalactic politics.

Near the elaborate ice sculptures, Lord Voss, a high-ranking commander of the Avian Fleet, ruffled his blue feathers. He leaned close to Chancellor Vane, an alien composed of sentient quartz.

""Did you see the ship on the royal pad?"" Voss clicked his beak nervously. ""The rose-gold one. It belongs to Emile.""

Vane’s crystalline matrix shifted in unease. ""I saw it. No weapons visible.""

""Because the ship is the weapon,"" whispered Lady Kael, a crustacean diplomat. ""I heard what happened to the Crimson Nebula Syndicate. They bombarded a human colony last month. It just so happened that block contained Emile's favorite artisan coffee shop.""

""Did the human military retaliate?"" Voss asked.

""No..."" Lady Kael shuddered. ""Emile's ship just appeared above the pirate flagship. He sent those two men of his in black suits. Thirty minutes later, the entire pirate command structure was dismantled.""

Before the avian could respond, the grand orchestral music shifted.

The massive double doors at the top of the sweeping white staircase pulled open. First, to the polite applause of the room, came Emperor Zogath and the Empress. They looked entirely dignified, though a close observer might notice they looked a bit sheepish, having quietly snuck back onto the planet only hours before the ceremony began. 

They descended the stairs and took their places at the head of the ballroom, their eyes darting nervously toward the balconies. Searching for the infamous Diva, hoping to not run into the man.

Then, the music faded into a dramatic, expectant silence.

The double doors opened once more. The ambient lights dimmed, leaving only a brilliant spotlight aimed at the top of the stairs.
Princess Lianna stepped forward.
Down below, the guests literally stopped breathing.

The dress was an impossible masterpiece. Woven from midnight-blue phase-silk, the fabric seemed to hold a galaxy within its threads, shifting from deep indigo to vibrant violet as she moved. The quantum-locked threads kept the fabric in absolute, flawless suspension, defying gravity entirely.

The thigh slit was there... aggressive, daring, and showcasing her powerful stance in the diamond-weave stilettos she now wore with mastery. But the bodice held the room captive. Plunging dangerously low, it was bold and unapologetic. Beneath the shimmering surface, the corset gave her posture a regal rigidity. She looked like a goddess of war descending from the heavens.

Lianna paused at the top of the stairs. She remembered Emile’s final lesson. Make them wait for it. They are on your time now.
She cast her gaze slowly over the High Council, her expression calm and dominant. Then, with smooth, fluid grace—heel, toe, glide—she began her descent.

The reaction was instantaneous. As she reached the floor, the stoic veneer of high society completely shattered.

Lord Voss practically shoved Chancellor Vane aside. ""Princess Lianna!"" Voss squawked, bowing low. ""The Avian Fleet wishes to gift you a custom luxury star-cruiser for your coming of age! Just... grant me the honor of a single dance tonight!""

A notoriously ruthless warlord from the outer rim dropped to one knee, offering her the deed to a private, terraformed resort moon simply to kiss the back of her hand. Husbands of powerful dignitaries were caught openly staring, mesmerized by the sheer aesthetic power she radiated. Several hushed arguments broke out between spouses across the ballroom.

She navigated the room with perfect poise, collecting reasonable but opulent gifts and promises of allegiance, her new-found confidence shining brighter than the jewels she wore.

Watching from the deep shadows near a stone pillar, Emile stood perfectly still. He pushed his frameless black glasses slightly up the bridge of his nose and allowed himself a very small smirk.

The night was a historic triumph. By the time the final guests departed, dawn was breaking over the Gekkonid homeworld.

Lianna found herself alone in the grand atrium. She felt powerful... untouchable. Realizing she hadn't seen her designer in hours, she hiked up the hem of her dress and hurried out to the royal courtyard.

She caught Emile just as his towering assistants were loading the last of his luggage trunks onto the ramp. The two female attendants were already aboard, having rolled up the midnight-blue carpet.

""You're leaving?"" Lianna called out.

Emile paused, turning slightly to look at her over his shoulder. ""Darling, a true artist never overstays his welcome. The work here is complete. The canvas is perfect. And honestly, I've just received an alert that a minor royal in the Delta Quadrant is attempting to pair neon green with burnt orange for a summer wedding. It’s a visual war crime.""

""How can I ever repay you, Emile?"" Lianna asked, stepping forward. ""You didn't just give me a dress. You terrified the High Council into submission. They were offering me luxury ships and resort moons just to look at me! And the rumors... they say you unmade a pirate syndicate to defend a coffee shop.”

She paused, taking a breath. “You brought my father to his knees with just your reputation. Your power is beyond anything I've ever comprehended.""

Emile let out a soft chuckle. He turned to face her fully, his hands casually resting in his pockets.

""You think I am powerful, Princess?""

Lianna nodded earnestly, looking at the man who had reshaped her world.

Emile lowered his frameless black glasses, his dark eyes meeting hers with a quiet, undeniable intensity. He held her gaze for a long moment, an aura of absolute authority radiating from him, tempered by a strange, genuine humility.

""Lianna..."" he said softly, a small smile playing at the corner of his lips. ""On the official Human Interstellar Fashion Index... I am not even ranked in the top one hundred Divas.""

He slid his glasses back up, turned on his heel, and walked up the ramp into his beautiful, silent ship, leaving the princess standing alone in the morning light.

I have been working on a project to fix my sleep and I wanted to share it here. I always struggle with taking pre workout or drinking coffee too late in the day and then tossing and turning all night. I realized I needed a way to actually enforce a caffeine curfew for myself.

I used Codex to build this watch app that tracks exactly how much active caffeine is still in your system. You log your drink and it calculates the drop off over time. It makes it super easy to see when you need to stop consuming caffeine so you can actually fall asleep at a normal hour.

If you want to get your sleep schedule back on track or just want to monitor your daily intake, go grab the download. 

I would love to hear what you all think and if you have any feedback to make it better.

I used Apple heath, Siri integrations, on device Apple Intelligence, and more to make the app as seamless as possible.

I’m graduating from college this year, and my mom has been wanting to take a trip together to celebrate. Costa Rica is her dream destination, so I’m planning the whole thing and would really appreciate some advice.

She’s in her early 60s, very active, but sensitive to strong sun/heat. She loves animals, so we’re planning a jungle-heavy, slower-paced trip rather than lots of beach lounging.

That said, she’s willing to try the beach for a few days. I personally really want to go to Manuel Antonio, but if there are better alternatives that still offer wildlife and some ocean without intense sun exposure, I’m open to suggestions.

We’ll be there Dec 15–29, renting a car, and staying in BnBs.

Current Itinerary:

• Dec 15 – Near SJO (airport night)

• Dec 16–20 – Arenal / La Fortuna (4 nights, volcano-view BnB booked)

• Dec 20–25 – Monteverde (5 nights)

• Dec 25–28 – Manuel Antonio / Quepos (3 nights)

• Dec 28 – BnB near SJO (for early flight on the 29th)

We’re intentionally keeping mornings relaxed and not stacking too many tours in one day.

Activities We’re Hoping to Do:

• Bird watching tour in Monteverde

• Cloud forest + hanging bridges

• Ziplining (once)

• Hot springs (1–2 visits)

• Coffee / chocolate tour

• Wildlife walks for sloths, toucans, monkeys

• Maybe horseback riding

• Volcano hike

• Night hikes 

For the beach portion:

• Manuel Antonio National Park wildlife

• Budget-friendly 3-hour fishing trip (I love fishing)

• Possibly a shared sailing trip

Questions:

	1.	Is 5 nights in Monteverde too long if wildlife is our main focus?

	2.	If Manuel Antonio isn’t ideal for someone sensitive to sun/heat, is there a better alternative that still has wildlife + some beach?

	3.	Budget-friendly fishing recommendations in Quepos (or elsewhere)?

	4.	Are shared catamaran sailing trips worth it?

	5.	Car rental companies you recommend and what insurance is actually necessary?

6. BnB recommendations for Monte Verde and Manuel Antonio? 

7. Food recommendations?

We’re trying to keep it meaningful, nature-heavy, and not overly expensive. This trip is really special for us, so I want to plan it well.

Thanks so much for any advice.",2,1771531535.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

The coffee maker gurgled to life and I watched Miles go through his morning routine with the kind of enthusiasm that only comes from years of functioning on four hours of sleep, pure caffeine, and a deep metaphysical resignation to suffering. He moved around my kitchen like he owned it, which I suppose he kind of did now, considering I had no use for physical possessions anymore on account of being extremely, aggressively dead.

He pulled down a chipped mug labeled and filled it nearly to the brim without spilling a drop.

""You know,"" I said, drifting closer with the kind of ominous casual energy that I was definitely going to weaponize as often as possible, ""we need to handle something.""

Miles took a sip and grimaced. ""It better not involve spirit leeches again."" He pointed at his left shoe. ""I still have salt in my right shoe. And my left shoe. And somehow my jacket pocket.""

""Worse than spirit leeches.""

He turned to look at me over the rim of the mug with the flat, exhausted expression of a man who had already used up his daily quota of surprise before 8 AM. ""Define worse.""

""We need to forge my will.""

Miles choked. Not a polite little cough, not a dignified sputter a full-throated, coffee-going-everywhere, hand-slapping-the-counter choke that sent a spray of dark roast across my previously clean kitchen counter.

""Excuse me?"" he wheezed, in a tone that suggested he was hoping he'd misheard me and I'd actually said something reasonable, like that we needed to fight a dragon, or reorganize the garage.

""Think about it logically,"" I said, because I am nothing if not logical, even in death. ""Eventually, someone's going to realize I'm not among the living anymore. Could be a week. Could be a month. Could be when my bank notices the direct deposits stopped. Point is, if you're not on some official paperwork somewhere, this house gets swallowed by probate court and handed off to either the state or whatever distant cousin twice removed decides to show up and claim it."" I paused for effect. ""You hate your apartment.""

""That's not—""

""The walls are paper thin. Your neighbor, Kyle, screams at his Xbox until 3 AM at least four nights a week. You keep losing packages to porch pirates.

Miles set the mug down and stared at the puddle of coffee spreading across the counter with the expression of a man watching his own composure dissolve in real time.

""Meanwhile,"" I pressed on, ""my place is fully paid off, thank you Grandma Rosa's inheritance and her deeply suspicious insistence that I 'keep it somewhere safe and not tell my mother.' The Wi-Fi doesn't suck. The water pressure is actually good. The nearest neighbor is Mrs. Calderón and she bakes empanadas on Sundays and leaves them on the porch and she will absolutely continue doing that whether you're here or not because she does not ask questions."" I drifted back slightly, magnanimously. ""Your roommate is literally incorporeal. I can't eat your leftovers, I can't hog the bathroom, I can't even turn the TV on without concentrating really hard. It's the perfect living situation. Move in, forge the will, and let's avoid losing my house to some rando from probate court who'll turn my bedroom into a home gym.""

Miles leaned against the counter, arms crossed, glaring at the coffee puddle as though it had personally wronged him, which I suppose it had. ""You realize forgery is a crime.""

""Technically.""

""As in jail. As in, there are buildings specifically designed to put people in for doing exactly this.""

""I'm a ghost,"" I said pleasantly. ""What are they gonna do, exorcise me? Make me haunt a slightly smaller house?""

He pinched the bridge of his nose. That was his tell. It meant he was already doing the math, already running the pros and cons, already seventy percent convinced and just looking for someone to blame when it inevitably worked. ""I don't know the first thing about writing a will.""

""Google exists. We have internet. This is not the dark ages."" I floated up toward the ceiling slightly, mostly for theatrical purposes. ""I, Lex Rodriguez, being of sound mind,” Miles made a face, ""and formerly sound body, hereby leave all earthly possessions, including but not limited to this house, the cast iron skillet that you have always coveted, and my extremely impressive vinyl collection, to Miles Navarro, my best friend and the only person who has never once called me too much."" I paused. ""That's it. That's the whole thing. We type it up, print it out, you sign it, we get it notarized somehow?""

""Notarized?!""

""We figure that part out later. Don't get bogged down in the details.""

Miles stared at me for a long moment. Then he dragged a hand down his face and looked back at the coffee puddle with what I could only describe as profound spiritual exhaustion. ""You're serious.""

""As a fatal heart attack."" I said it without thinking, and then there was a beat of silence, and then we both started laughing despite ourselves, because what else could we do.

""Okay,"" he said, still wheezing slightly. ""Okay. But. Setting aside the felony."" He held up one finger. ""If I forge a will leaving everything to me, and it comes out that I was the last person to see you alive, I don't just look suspicious. I look incredible suspicious. I look like the season finale of a prestige crime drama.""

""You're overthinking this.""

""I was literally here the morning you died, Lex.""

""I choked on a nugget,"" I said flatly. ""Unless you shoved it down my throat while I wasn't looking, I think you're probably clear.""

""Doesn't matter,"" Miles said, the horror dawning across his face in real time as he clearly began building the narrative in his own head. ""True crime podcasts don't care about what actually happened. They care about what sounds compelling. Best friend inherits house after best friend dies in freak nugget tragedy? Miles. They're going to eat that up. That practically writes itself.""

""You're being dramatic.""

""Am I?"" He was pacing now, which was always a sign that his brain had fully committed to a bit. ""They're going to call it something. They always call it something. Something with a pun, because it's always a pun."" He stopped walking and looked at me with an expression of genuine dawning horror. ""Lex. They're going to call it—""

""Don't.""

""Fowl Play.""

The word hung in the air between us.

""I hate you,"" I said.

""That's the name of the podcast. A twelve-part series. Fowl Play: The Lex Rodriguez Story. Hosted by some woman with a very soothing voice who clearly thinks I did it. Every episode ending on a dramatic sting and the words: 'But did Miles really act alone?'""

""They're going to dig up your old tweets,"" I said, because if we were going down this road, we were going all the way. ""That one from 2019 where you said you wanted to commit crimes against a twenty-piece nugget meal.""

Miles made a sound like a man whose soul was departing his body. ""They're going to splice that directly over slow-motion footage of my mugshot. Some producer is going to sit in a darkened edit bay and think 'yeah, this is the moment.' I'll be in county, getting weird looks from people who've listened to the podcast, while an ad for a mattress company plays and then a voiceover says, 'Was Miles hungry for more than nuggets? The answer, after the break.'""

""Season one, episode three, Breadcrumbs of Betrayal."" I said, grinning.

""They'll interview everyone we went to college with. Stefanie from my sophomore dorm is going to go on camera and say she always thought there was 'something off' about me, and she is going to mean it because she never forgave me for eating her leftovers that one time.""

""She'll get her own episode,"" I agreed. ""Dramatic reenactment with an actor who looks nothing like you.""

""They'll dig up my high school photos."" His voice had taken on a haunted, hollow quality. ""The yearbook ones. I had braces and I was going through a phase where I thought I should be wearing more layers."" He stopped. ""I looked like a stock photo they use on websites that explain what a suspicious person looks like.""

""The actor in the reenactment will look better than you.""

""Obviously. They always cast someone conventionally attractive so you feel conflicted about whether they did it."" He pressed his forehead against the cabinet door and stayed there for a moment, communing with the wood grain. ""God. You're really serious about the will thing.""

""I am extremely serious about the will thing."" I drifted over to him and hovered nearby with what I hoped conveyed earnest sincerity. ""Look. Either you forge it and keep the house, or in four months some bank vulture sells it to a developer who'll gut the whole thing and Airbnb my bedroom to tourists who want a 'spooky Portland experience' and then I have to haunt a rotating cast of strangers taking photos for Instagram."" I let that sit for a second. ""You want that for me?""

Miles lifted his head from the cabinet. He looked at the mug. He looked at the coffee puddle, still sitting there, still waiting. He looked at the general air mass where I was hovering.

""If I die in jail,"" he said finally, reaching for a dish towel to wipe up the counter, ""I am coming back as a ghost and kicking your spectral ass.""

""Deal,"" I said. ""I'll even let you haunt the better bedroom.""

He drained the rest of the coffee in one long suffering swallow and set the mug down with the resigned force of a man accepting his fate. ""Okay. Okay. We do the will thing. But we do it carefully, and you are going to help me with every single word, and if this goes wrong, I reserve the right to say 'I told you so' from prison.""

""Noted and agreed."" I drifted toward the living room, feeling almost light. Almost. ""Now. While we're planning our life of crime, we also need to deal with the other thing.""

Miles looked up. ""What other thing.""

""We need intel. We need to understand the rules of whatever world I've accidentally become a citizen of.""

""Research,"" he said. ""Portland's got an active occult community. Witch shops, metaphysical bookstores, people who take moon phases personally. If there's a real supernatural underground operating in this city, someone's gotta know about it.""

""We're just going to walk into a shop and ask about the local ghost mafia?""

""That's option A."" He was already typing. ""Option B is that we do some reconnaissance first and don't announce ourselves until we have some idea what we're walking into. Apparently I've been watching too many heist movies, but it feels relevant."" He paused, frowning at the screen. ""There's a lot of noise here. A lot of people who think Mercury retrograde is responsible for their internet going down. But—""

""But?""

""There's this forum. Portland Dark."" He turned the phone slightly so I could see the screen, “Looks like it's for people who've had actual encounters. Real ones. Not 'I felt a presence' nonsense, actual experiences.""

I drifted closer to look. The forum was plain layout, muted colors, the kind of design that said we are not trying to attract attention rather than we don't know how CSS works. But the post titles told a different story:

Vape shop on Hawthorne dispensing more than nicotine.

Missing persons reports clustering around Burnside Bridge, pattern or coincidence?

""Oh,"" I said quietly. ""These are real people.""

""Yeah."" Miles was already scrolling. ""And look at this thread."" He pulled it up.

THREAD: Has anyone else noticed the increase in ""electrical problems"" downtown?

POSTED BY: WiredWitch47

My shop's had three different electricians out this week. Every time they say the wiring's fine, but the lights keep flickering and the register keeps opening by itself. Manager thinks it's a prank, but I've worked here two years and nothing like this has ever happened before. Started about a week ago. Lights, computers, even the automatic doors are acting up. Plus customers keep complaining about cold spots near the back corner.

REPLY BY: SaltCircleSam

Classic Level 1-3 manifestation behavior. Someone new died recently and they're learning to interact with the physical world. Usually stops after they figure out more efficient methods or run down their initial energy reserve.

REPLY BY: PortlandMedium

@SaltCircleSam is correct. Newly transitioned spirits frequently lack control over their manifestation. The disruption typically resolves once they receive proper guidance or exhaust their initial kinetic potential. The cold spots suggest the spirit is pulling thermal energy to sustain themselves rather than drawing from an existing ley line, which indicates they haven't found their anchor yet.

Miles raised an eyebrow. ""This PortlandMedium guy. He's explaining ghost mechanics like he wrote the handbook.""

""Or read the handbook."" I hovered over his shoulder. ""Pull up his profile.""

Miles clicked. PortlandMedium had been active for three years. Mostly answering questions. Long, careful, clinically precise answers that never got rattled even when the threads devolved into argument or panic. His bio was stripped down to almost nothing: Certified paranormal thermographer. Wards, exorcisms, post-mortem conflict resolution. DM for consultations.

""Certified paranormal thermographer,"" Miles said. ""Is that a real credential or did he invent it?""

“Message him.""

""Right now? We don't know anything about this person.""

""We know he knows more than we do, which currently means he knows more than anyone else on the planet from my perspective."" I gave him what I hoped was a compelling look. ""Message him.""

Miles cracked his knuckles like he was preparing for combat. ""What exactly am I supposed to say? 'Hi, my dead best friend is trying to avoid getting soul-sucked by a crime boss who runs the Portland afterlife, any tips?""

""Slightly more subtle than that.""

He started typing, reading aloud as he went.

SUBJECT: Definitely Not a Cry for Help (But Also, Help)

Hi,

So hypothetically, if someone accidentally claimed a haunted domain in NE Davis and then immediately got attacked by a spectral parasite that drinks ghost juice, what’s the best course of action to avoid not dying twice?

Also, there’s talk of a Wraith Queen. That’s either a local cryptid or what? Any tips on defensive wards, ghost politics, or just a general “how not to get eaten by the dead” guide would be stellar.

Sincerely,
One Very Alive Human and One Very Not

AE

He hit send and looked up at me. ""And now we wait.""

""And now we wait,"" I agreed.

I drifted into the living room while Miles started a second cup of coffee and began pulling up whatever he could find about Portland's occult geography. I hovered near the TV, a habit, I was realizing, born from years of watching it in that exact spot on the couch.

The house felt like mine in a way it never quite had when I was alive. I could sense its edges. The property line ran like a seam in the world, and inside of it everything was just slightly more present to me than the outside. My domain. My anchor. My extremely haunted and apparently legally precarious real estate.

Less than twenty-four hours ago, my biggest crisis had been a guild warning about missing a raid. My actual, real-world concerns had been: do I have enough for groceries, why does my knee do that clicking thing when I go down stairs.

Now I was a ghost. Now there was a Wraith Queen. Now my best friend was committing felony document fraud on my behalf and browsing supernatural forums at 8 AM and somehow I was more worried about losing the house to probate court than I was about any of the rest of it.

Honestly? I've had worse Tuesdays.

Not the kind that begins with running or screaming, but the kind that begins quietly, already in progress, as though you have stepped into something that has been waiting for you.

I was a child in the dream, small enough that my feet didn’t quite touch the floor when I sat on the couch. The living room was old — not abandoned, but forgotten. Wood-paneled walls swallowed the light. Heavy curtains smothered the windows. A faint lamp glowed in the corner, but it did not brighten the room so much as reveal how dark it really was.

In front of me sat a small box television on a dusty wooden table. Its screen flickered softly, casting pale light across the carpet and the coffee table littered with coasters no one used anymore. The air felt thick, like it had been still for years.

I don’t remember turning the television on.

It was simply already playing.

A late-night interview.

The host’s voice was calm and measured, the kind adults use when discussing something tragic. Across from him sat an older woman — mid-50s, maybe early 60s — with short, grayish-black curls and a face marked by time. She wore a gentle expression, her posture composed, her hands folded neatly in her lap.

“Margaret Vale,” the host said softly, “thank you for agreeing to speak with us tonight. We understand this is not easy. Your entire family passed away in a single night under circumstances authorities were never able to explain. You were the only survivor.”

Margaret smiled.

It was the kind of smile adults give when they want to reassure everyone else that they are alright, even when they are not.

“I’ve learned to live with it,” she replied. Her voice was warm. Almost grandmotherly. “There are things we aren’t meant to understand.”

The audience murmured sympathetically.

The host leaned forward slightly. “Investigators ruled the fire undetermined. No accelerants. No electrical faults. No sign of forced entry. Some have called it… impossible.”

Margaret’s smile faltered.

Not fully.

Just for a moment.

And then someone moved behind her.

In the blurred background of the stage, a figure passed — or perhaps lingered — just slightly out of focus. The camera adjusted. The lens tightened.

It zoomed in closer to her face.

Closer than necessary.

The studio audience fell silent.

Not gradually.

All at once.

Margaret stopped blinking.

Her eyes no longer seemed moist or human. They were open too evenly, too deliberately. The faint studio hum deepened into something almost electrical, like the sound of wires straining.

As a child on the couch, I felt the living room change.

The shadows along the walls thickened. The lamp’s glow dimmed without actually turning off. The only true light now came from the television.

Margaret’s expression drained.

Not into sadness.

Into absence.

The camera remained fixed on her.

Too long.

Long enough that it no longer felt like a broadcast, but a stare.

Then, slowly, her pupils shifted.

Not toward the host.

Not toward the audience.

Toward the camera.

Toward me.

My small hands tightened into the couch cushions.

A faint sound slipped through the TV speakers — a dry, stretching noise, like leather pulled past its limit.

Her lips began to curl upward.

But nothing else on her face moved.

No cheek muscles. No softening around the eyes. No lines forming naturally.

Just the mouth.

Stretching.

Wider.

Thinner.

Sharper.

Her teeth appeared narrower than before, elongated in a way that did not match the rest of her face. Her pupils dilated until the color of her irises nearly disappeared.

The corners of the television screen flickered.

The frame around it blurred.

And then I realized something impossible.

There was no longer a television.

The box, the dusty table, the edges of the screen — they were gone.

Yet she remained.

Floating in the same position, suspended in the darkness of the living room, which was no longer a room at all but a void pressing in from every direction.

Her silhouette began to rise, separating from the place where the screen should have been.

Her skin turned a muted gray, the texture dulling as if drained of warmth. The smile twitched, glitching unnaturally, as though something inside her was adjusting to fit.

And then she spoke.

Not in the calm tone from earlier.

Not layered.

Not distorted.

Just raw.

Accusatory.

Furious.

“HOW COULD YOU DO THIS!!!”

The words did not echo. They struck.

The darkness swallowed everything except her face. Behind her, for a fraction of a second, shapes flickered — faint outlines of people standing too close, their features indistinct, their forms wavering like heat above pavement. They did not accuse. They did not plead.

They simply existed.

Her eyes widened further, impossibly so, until the whites seemed to glow. The smile did not break. It deepened, stretching beyond the structure of bone and skin, no longer resembling a human expression but a mask splitting at the seams.

There was no softness now.

No trembling.

No hint of another self trying to surface.

Whatever had once been Margaret Vale — the grieving widow, the gentle grandmotherly presence — dissolved behind the expanding grin. The kindness did not fight. It did not beg. It did not surface again.

It was consumed.

Her head tilted slightly, as if studying me with curiosity rather than rage, and in that moment I understood something without knowing how: she was not confused about her family. She was not seeking justice. In her fractured mind, her victims and her loved ones had become indistinguishable. The fire, the disappearances, the grief — they had merged into one narrative where blame always belonged to someone else.

To whoever was watching.

To whoever knew.

The smile widened one final increment, splitting wider than anatomy allows, until her face became almost geometric — a square of teeth and shadow. Her eyes expanded into hollow circles of white light.

The void swallowed the last trace of the living room.

The lamp.

The couch.

My small legs dangling above the floor.

All gone.

Only her face remained, suspended in absolute blackness.

Then—

Everything stopped.

Not faded.

Not dimmed.

Stopped.

As though the world had been paused by a hand outside the dream.

The scream ceased mid-breath.

The smile froze.

The glowing eyes locked open.

Complete silence.

… Then I woke up. The cold sweat from this hellish nightmare didn’t stop, because I don’t remember leaving the TV on before going to sleep… and I’ve never owned a box television.

I haven’t slept in three days. Not because I’m not tired and not because I’ve been drinking too much coffee. I’m exhausted. My eyes burn my hands shake, and my thoughts feel slower than they should. But every time I start to fall asleep, something in my room makes sure I wake up.

It started three nights ago. I woke up suddenly like someone had called my name right next to my ear. My room was dark and completely silent. I live alone so there shouldn’t have been any sound at all. I grabbed my phone from the nightstand and checked the time. 3:17 AM. I remember staring at the numbers for a few seconds before convincing myself it was just a random wake up. People wake up in the middle of the night all the time. I turned over and eventually fell back asleep.

The second night was different. I didn’t wake up naturally. I felt it first. The mattress shifted slightly, like someone had pressed their hand into it. I froze. My eyes were still closed, but I was awake. I could feel the weight near the edge of my bed close to my legs. My heart started pounding so hard I was sure whoever or whatever was there could hear it. I slowly opened my eyes.

My room was empty.

I sat up immediately and turned on the lamp. Nothing was there. Closet door closed. Bedroom door closed. Windows locked from the inside. I checked under the bed even though I felt stupid doing it. Nothing. When I finally picked up my phone, it was 3:17 AM again.

Tonight is the third night. I haven’t even tried to sleep. I’ve been sitting against the headboard with the lights off pretending I’m brave enough to face whatever this is. It’s 3:16 right now. My phone is in my hand as I write this.

The room feels different. Heavy. Like the air is thicker.

I just heard the mattress move.

Thinking about how my experience at Costco has been recently, I’m struggling to justify the cost of membership now when considering the experience of going and what you get out of it.

While going to Costco has never been pleasant, nowadays going there is completely miserable. Doesn’t even what time of day it is, in the GTA each Costco is always packed. So packed that you have to wait for parking spots to open up, scanning the parking lot like a hawk. Then going into the store, there is so many people since everyone and their dog now has a membership. And when it’s packed the checkout lines, though fast, are long as hell, sometimes stretching across the whole store.

There are some good deals at Costco like bread, eggs, coffee, anything in bulk… but honestly it’s not even worth it anymore. Why spend an entire afternoon or evening trying to fight your way in and out of the building when you can just go to a local grocery with comparable prices on things?

Last month it was the garbage disposal making that awful grinding noise. This week it’s the bathroom sink draining so slowly I could brush my teeth and make coffee before it clears. I thought owning a place would feel stable and grown up. Instead it feels like I’m constantly waiting for the next minor disaster. I have some money saved up, but I always hesitate to touch it. In my head that savings account is for real emergencies, not a plumber charging 180 just to show up and tell me there’s hair in the pipes. So I end up watching YouTube videos at 10 pm, under the sink with a flashlight in my mouth, trying to convince myself this is character building.   
The annoying part is none of it is catastrophic. It’s just a steady drip of small, unglamorous expenses. Air filters, random tools I didn’t know I needed, replacing a smoke detector battery that decided to die at 2 am. No one talks about how mentally draining the constant maintenance is.

I don’t regret buying, but I definitely underestimated the low-level stress of being the only person responsible when something breaks. At what point does this start to feel normal instead of mildly panic-inducing?",17,1771530631.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

1r99b9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r99b9p/the_last_shift/,The Last Shift,"The first thing Ana Vukić did every night when she came on shift was check the vending machine on the second floor. Not to buy anything. The machine had been out of the cheese crackers she liked for three weeks, and whoever ordered the restocks had replaced them with a brand that tasted like the cardboard they came in. She checked it the way you check a door you've already locked. Ritual. The machine's orange glow meant the second floor was empty and ordinary, the light spilling out into the corridor the way it always did, and she could walk past it toward the nursing station and feel the shift settle into its grooves.

Tonight the machine was dark.

She stood in the corridor for a moment, her lanyard swinging against her chest, and waited for a reason. A power fluctuation, maybe. The maintenance guys had been on the third floor all week patching something in the electrical conduit. She'd signed their work order herself on Tuesday. That was probably it. She walked past.

The nursing station on two was empty at this hour, the overnight skeleton crew rotated between floors on a schedule she'd long since memorized, so she didn't stop. Third floor next. The elevator opened onto a smell of floor cleaner and something underneath it, sharper, that she clocked and kept moving past without examining. Cleaning products sometimes reacted to each other in ways that produced odd smells. She'd learned this six years ago, her first week, when she'd called facilities at 2 AM convinced there was a gas leak. The facilities guy had been kind about it.

She walked the third-floor corridor, testing doors. Utility closet, locked. Linen storage, locked. The room at the end, 318, had its door slightly open, not wide, just the latch not quite caught, and she nudged it shut with her shoulder and heard the click and kept walking.

It was 11:47 PM.

---

She ate her dinner at the first-floor security desk. Half a sandwich from home, an orange she'd been meaning to eat since Monday, bad coffee from the break room pot that she could never bring herself to clean thoroughly enough. On the monitors above the desk, the building sat in its nighttime configuration — empty corridors, empty waiting rooms, the occasional orderly crossing a frame. She watched the screens the way you watch a familiar film, not for plot but for the comfort of knowing what came next.

Her phone said 12:30. She made her second round.

The second floor was fine. The vending machine was still dark. She stopped this time and pressed the power button on the side panel, which sometimes worked and tonight didn't. She wrote it in the maintenance log and moved on.

The third floor was where she noticed the smell again.

Stronger now, and she was able to place it: copper, and something beneath the copper that had no name she could think of. She stopped outside the nursing station and checked the monitor bank. All clear, the same blinking green she'd expect. Then she heard the sound from down the corridor.

It was not, in itself, frightening. It was just a sound. Wet, rhythmic, with a pause and then a continuation. The pause was long. Not quite the length of a breath, not quite the length of anything she could name. She stood in the corridor and listened and the sound stopped and the silence that followed it was the most specific silence she'd ever heard it was the silence of something that knows it has been heard.

She walked toward room 318.

The door was open again.

She pushed it all the way and stood in the frame and the room was not empty. There was a man, crouched at the foot of the bed, and the bed was occupied, and the occupant was not moving, and the monitor beside the bed was showing a flatline that was making no sound because the monitor had been switched off at the panel, and the man at the foot of the bed turned and looked at her.

She ran.

---

Not back toward the elevator. Some instinct she would not have been able to explain chose the stairwell at the far end of the corridor, and she hit the door at speed and took the stairs two at a time going down, her radio out before she'd cleared the second landing. She said the words she'd trained to say. *Security, third floor, room 318, emergency, need response.* Back came silence, and then static, and then a tone that meant the channel was open and empty.

She burst through the ground floor stairwell door and cut left toward the main desk and stopped.

The corridor had gone off somehow.

The lights were on. That wasn't it. The corridor was the same corridor she had walked a hundred nights, the same linoleum, the same motivational poster about handwashing that she'd always meant to ask someone to take down, the same door to the supply room that stuck in wet weather. It was the same. But the end of it, where the lobby was, where the front desk was, where the main entrance doors were, had a darkness that she couldn't resolve into anything specific. Not a power outage. The lights at that end were on. The darkness was something else.

She made herself walk toward it. Five steps. Ten. The darkness at the end of the corridor didn't change as she approached. It didn't recede the way darkness recedes when you walk toward a light source. It stayed where it was, and her legs stopped walking before she'd told them to.

The sound from the stairwell.

Wet. Rhythmic. Paused long.

She turned around. The stairwell door was closed. The sound was coming from the other side of it, not urgent, not fast. Unhurried. The door had no lock she could engage from this side, only a latch that a firm push would open. She pressed her back against the opposite wall and watched the door.

The sound stopped.

She could not hear her own breathing. The building had gone to a silence so complete that either it was absorbing sound or she had gone somewhere past the point where sound reached her. She thought, very clearly: *I should call the police.* She looked at her phone and the screen was dark. It had been at 74% battery twenty minutes ago. She pressed the side button and the screen stayed dark and she pressed it again and held it and nothing happened.

She tried the radio again. The channel opened, empty. She said her name, said the building name, said the floor, said *please respond,* said it again, and nothing came back. She lowered the radio. No one was coming.

It was in here with her and the building was keeping that between them.

The stairwell door opened.

She was already moving. Down the corridor, away from the sealed lobby, away from the stairwell. The only direction left was the service corridor past the supply room. The door behind her swung on its hinges and she did not look back. She tried to run but her legs had gone heavy from the knee down. She ran anyway. Not fast enough. She knew it wasn't fast enough.

The service corridor was narrow and the lights in it were the older kind, fluorescent, two of them flickering in a way they hadn't before, and the sound of them was very loud, and underneath it was the other sound. She couldn't tell where it was coming from. Behind her, maybe. Maybe from ahead. The corridor bent left at the end and she couldn't see what was around it.

She stopped at the bend.

Because she had understood what it was doing. Three weeks of quiet wards. Monitors switched off. Deaths that didn't quite fit their paperwork. It hadn't been finding food. It had been learning the building.

It wasn't chasing her. It knew where the corners were.

She pressed her back to the wall at the bend and made herself breathe. The lobby was sealed. The stairwells were behind her. The imaging suites around the bend had a maintenance entrance it might not know about. She pushed off the wall and went.

She thought about the man she'd seen at the foot of the bed. The way he'd turned and looked at her. Not with surprise. He'd already known she was there.

She realized she was crying. Not loudly, not in a way that would give her away, tears she didn't wipe because wiping them meant moving her hands.

Then she made herself move.

Down the service corridor, away from the bend, away from both the sounds and the silence that was worse than the sounds. The supply room door was unlocked. She went in and wedged herself between a shelf of saline bags and the wall and pulled her knees up and held them and waited to find out how the next part went.

---

The supply room smelled of latex and old cardboard. She had her back against the wall behind the door before she'd made the decision to put it there. She pulled a saline bag from the shelf at her left and held it in both hands and sat with her knees against her chest and listened.

The corridor outside was quiet. Then footsteps. Not the wet rhythmic sound. Multiple doors opening and closing. The utility closet, the linen storage, the door that stuck in wet weather. Moving toward her.

She gripped the saline bag. She was aware this would do nothing. She gripped it anyway because her hands needed something to hold or they were going to start shaking hard enough to make noise.

She waited to find out whether the footsteps and the other sound were the same thing.

The supply room door opened.

A woman, tall, dark jacket, hands visible and still. She looked at Ana behind the shelf and said: ""Ana Vukić. Security. I need you to stay where you are for ninety more seconds.""

Her Serbian was accented. Not badly, but accented.

""What—"" Ana said.

""Ninety seconds.""

She pulled the door almost closed. Through the gap Ana could see the corridor, and then she heard it again, the wet rhythmic sound, the pause that went on too long, and then something happened in the corridor that Ana only partly processed. Movement, fast and certain, and a sound of impact that was not what she expected impact to sound like, and then a sound like a door to a flooded room being opened, a rush and then nothing.

Silence.

The door opened all the way. The woman stepped back into the supply room and Ana could see past her into the corridor. There was a dark smear on the linoleum that hadn't been there before, and the fluorescent light at the far end was swinging slightly, as though something had passed under it at speed. Nothing else. The corridor was empty.

Ana looked at it for two seconds and then looked at the floor.

""Okay,"" the woman said. ""Are you hurt?""

""No."" Ana's voice came out thinner than she wanted it to.

""Can you stand?""

She could. She found this out by trying. She came out from behind the shelf and stood in the middle of the supply room under the fluorescent light and the woman looked her over without touching her.

""What was that,"" Ana said.

""A person in severe medical distress. We've called it in."" ""You surprised them. They fled. The building is secure.""

Ana looked at her. The composed face. The still hands.

""Who are you,"" Ana said.

""My name is Noa. I work with the hospital on security reviews."" She paused. ""I know this is not enough. But you are safe, and nothing that happened tonight is something you did wrong, and I would like you to sit down for a few minutes while I make some calls.""

Ana sat down on a box of nitrile gloves and noticed that she was shaking.

Noa took out a phone. Hers was working fine. She stepped slightly aside and spoke in a language that was not Serbian or any language Ana recognized, quiet and quick, and then came back and sat on a shelf across from Ana and didn't say anything, which was, the most decent thing anyone had done for her all night.

After a few minutes Ana said: ""Is the patient in 318 okay.""

""I don't know yet.""

Ana nodded. Then: ""Are there more of them.""

Noa looked at her steadily. ""Not in this building tonight.""

She didn't ask anything else. The questions she hadn't asked stayed where they were.

---

At some point a second person arrived, a young man with a soft voice who asked if Ana would be willing to answer a few questions for their incident report. She said yes. He sat beside her and asked about the shift, what time she'd come on, what her routine was, when she'd first noticed something unusual. His voice was very calm. The questions were ordinary. After the third or fourth one she found herself talking, and the talking helped, the way talking sometimes helped, and at some point she wasn't quite in the supply room anymore but somewhere that was between talking and sleep, still aware, but aware the way you're aware through glass.

She wasn't afraid anymore. She noticed this without attaching anything to it.

The young man's voice, very even: *Can you tell me again what you noticed on the second floor?*

And she told him.

---

She woke at her desk at 3:14 AM.

The monitor screens above her showed the building in its nighttime configuration, every floor green. Her sandwich was eaten, the orange was peeled, the coffee mug was empty. Her shift log was filled in up to 3:00 AM in her own handwriting: *2nd floor vending unit, power failure, maintenance logged. Rounds clear.* She read it twice and accepted it.

She had the vague, pressed feeling of someone who fell asleep at their desk. She stretched her neck. She finished the shift and handed over to the morning guard and took the tram home as the city came up gray and orange around her, the tram mostly empty, a man asleep across the seats at the far end, pigeons picking at something on the platform as the doors closed.

She slept until afternoon.

When she came back for her next shift three nights later, she noticed the vending machine on the second floor was working again. The cheese crackers were back, the right brand, the slot fully stocked. She bought a pack and ate them at her desk and felt, without being able to say why, that something small had been restored.

She made her first round at midnight. The building was quiet. The corridors were empty in the way corridors are empty.

She checked the third floor last.

Room 318 was being used for storage now, a new policy, something about ward reconfiguration, a memo she'd read. She tried the door. Locked. She moved on down the corridor toward the stairwell, and at the door she paused, her hand on the push bar, and stood there for a moment without knowing why she'd stopped.

The building held its breath the way buildings do at this hour.

She pushed through and took the stairs down.",5,1771530491.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

I recently moved to the Island and I’m hoping to connect with other people working in film & post-production out here.

I’m a full-time colorist and finishing producer currently working remotely for a Vancouver-based company, but I’d love to meet local crew, creatives, and anyone involved in film, video, or post.

If there’s already a community or regular meetups I’d be happy to join and if not, would anyone be interested in grabbing a coffee or a drink and talking shop?

Always great to put faces to names and build connections locally.

Cheers!

Visiting next week,"Sup everyone — I’m a 31M bartender with about 10 years of experience, currently living in Tampa (originally from NJ), planning to move to Denver around May.

I’ll likely be transferring to Cheesecake Factory, either the Lakewood or Lone Tree location. I’ve been strongly considering RiNo because it seems lively, walkable, and good for meeting people, especially being single and working in hospitality. I also know a few people in RiNo already who work in the industry.

At the same time, I’ve looked into living in Lakewood, specifically the Green Mountain area. I have married friends there who work at Cheesecake Factory at the new mall, too, and I know it’s beautiful and close to nature, but it seems more suburban and quiet. I’m not against that, but ideally I’d like somewhere with more of a scene with both — walkable coffee shops, bars, gyms, and energy around me. I’m open to anywhere, not just RiNo. I still want to be close to Mountain access too thats why I'm here. 

I’ll actually be visiting Denver next week and will have a rental car, so I’m planning to explore different neighborhoods in person. Any advice on what areas I should drive around, spend time in, or even grab a drink/coffee to get a real feel for daily life?

For those who live in Denver:

* Would RiNo be a realistic commute-wise to Lakewood or Lone Tree?
* Is Green Mountain/Lakewood too quiet for someone single in their early 30s?
* What other neighborhoods should I check out that balance walkability, social life, and commute?
* Any areas that are especially good for hospitality workers?
* What do you think I should pay attention to when visiting to know if a neighborhood is the right fit?

I know people in both Lakewood and RiNo, but it would really be dope to get a true Coloradan perspective. Appreciate any insight.",3,1771530277.0,MovingtoDenver,14,1.0,False

I made $93k last year in a HCOL state, I've been divorced for a few years, live in a townhouse, no kids.  I'm a millennial stereotype, dog-mom and #travel lol.  Some points 

* I just started an IRA and a brokerage, but that's with existing money and isn't part of the budget 
* I have a fully funded emergency fund in a HYSA
* I travel a LOT, but get a lot of free flights from credit card points.  The Travel spend category includes annual fees for my travel cards. 
* Fun Money -> Dining is just a catch-all for everything.  Work lunches, Wawa coffees, take out, alcohol, girls nights, etc.  
* I was lucky to not have expensive home repairs last year, but I have the e-fund, and separate sinking funds for homes repairs and decor/remodels respectively 
* Yes I know housing is a big percentage of my budget, but it's cheaper and better for a dog than renting in this area.  And I did 25% down thanks to the divorce settlement, which would not have helped with apartments 

I use YNAB, so since everything gets allocated it *feels* like I spend a lot, despite the savings categories.   Besides investing more (which I'm working on and would love tips!), anything to really change or point out? ",28,1771530190.0,MiddleClassFinance,16,0.86,False

1r994e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1r994e5/5_sciencebased_ways_to_care_for_your_introverted/,5 Science-Based Ways to Care for Your Introverted Friend,"Studied intro/extro dynamics for months after watching my best friend crash and burn from social exhaustion. She kept saying yes to everything, pushing through ""just one more hangout,"" until she literally stopped responding to texts for two weeks. That's when I realized most of us have zero clue how to be good friends to introverts.

This isn't some ""introverts are misunderstood unicorns"" post. It's about understanding basic neurological differences. Dr. Marti Olsen Laney's research shows introverts literally process dopamine differently. Their brains take a longer pathway through areas associated with internal experience, while extroverts get that quick dopamine hit from external stimulation. So when your introverted friend bails on plans, their brain isn't being difficult, it's actually protecting their nervous system from overload.

I went deep into books, neuroscience research, psych podcasts because I wanted to stop accidentally draining the people I care about. Here's what actually helped.

**1. Stop treating ""maybe"" like a solid yes**

When an introvert says maybe to your party invite, they're doing complex mental math about their energy reserves for the next week. Most of us hear ""maybe"" and assume they'll show up, then get annoyed when they don't.

The book ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" by Susan Cain (NYT bestseller, TED talk with 30M+ views) completely changed how I think about this. Cain spent seven years researching introversion and the book is packed with neuroscience explaining why introverts need recovery time that feels almost physical. This is the best book on understanding temperament differences I've ever read. Makes you question everything about how society values constant socializing.

Give your friend an actual out. Text them ""hey, totally fine if you need to skip, just let me know"" the day of. Watch how much more they'll actually show up when they don't feel trapped.

**2. Offer low-pressure hangout options**

Group dinners and loud bars aren't everyone's idea of connection. For many introverts, that's just exhausting performance art.

Suggest alternatives. ""Want to grab coffee and walk around the park?"" ""Down for a movie night at mine?"" ""Need a gym buddy?"" These create space for actual conversation without the overstimulation.

If you want to go deeper into understanding different communication styles and relationship dynamics, there's this AI-powered app called BeFreed that's been pretty helpful. It pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights on topics like this to create personalized audio content. You can set a specific goal like ""understand my introverted friends better"" and it builds a custom learning plan from quality sources. The cool part is adjusting the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples when something really clicks. Makes it easy to learn during commutes or workouts without having to sit down and read.

The podcast ""The Introvert Dear"" by Jenn Granneman breaks down different ways introverts recharge. Some need total solitude, others are fine with parallel play (being near someone while doing separate things). Worth a listen to understand it's not one-size-fits-all.

**3. Respect the recharge period after big events**

Your introverted friend seemed fine at the wedding, laughing and chatting all night. Then they vanished for a week. You're not being ghosted. They're recovering.

""The Introvert Advantage"" by Marti Olsen Laney (she's a psychotherapist who literally wrote her doctoral dissertation on introversion) explains this perfectly. Introverts can absolutely enjoy socializing and appear extroverted, but it depletes their energy tank in a way it doesn't for extroverts. The book gets into acetylcholine pathways and why introverts need downtime to process experiences. Insanely good read if you want the science behind it.

Don't take it personally when they need space. Send a ""hope you're doing good, no need to respond"" text so they know you're thinking of them without adding pressure to engage.

**4. Never surprise them with ""just one more person""**

""Oh btw, Sarah's coming too!"" might seem harmless to you. To an introvert who mentally prepared for a one on one hangout, you just changed the entire energy of the situation.

Introverts often plan their social interactions. They think about conversation topics, anticipate the vibe, budget their energy. Switching it up last minute feels like showing up to take a math test and finding out it's actually public speaking.

Always give a heads up if plans are changing, especially if more people are involved. It's basic respect for how someone operates.

**5. Stop trying to ""fix"" them**

The worst thing you can say: ""You should get out more!"" ""You're too quiet!"" ""Just be more social!""

They're not broken. Introversion isn't a flaw that needs correcting. It's a legitimate personality trait with actual evolutionary advantages (introverts tend to be more observant, better listeners, deeper thinkers).

If you're genuinely worried they're isolating due to depression, that's different. The app Finch is actually great for building healthy habits and tracking mood patterns if someone's struggling. But there's a massive difference between depression and introversion.

Your job as a friend isn't to drag them to every social event. It's to accept how they're wired and meet them where they are.

The YouTube channel Psych2Go has solid videos on introversion myths that are worth watching if you want quick visual explanations. Their ""10 Things Introverts Hate"" video especially nails the common mistakes people make.

Bottom line: good friendships aren't about forcing someone to match your energy. They're about understanding that different brains need different things. Stop treating introversion like antisocial behavior or something to overcome. Start seeing it as just another way humans are wired to exist in the world.

Your introverted friends will actually want to hang out more when they don't feel pressured to perform extroversion every single time.",1,1771530062.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

1r992sv,/r/PakistanAutoHub/comments/1r8cu6r/4x4_advice_greatly_needed/,4x4 advice greatly needed.,"Hey everyone. 
I hope you all are well, 
There is a vast amount of knowledge on here, so I was hoping to tap into some of that. 

I have recently moved from overseas to Karachi. I  Will be here for a year or so before I shift back. 

In that time I would like to continue my vehicular obsession and explore Pakistan (especially Northern and balchochistan depending on safety). Also to do some healthy off roading and stream crossings like in the recent Kharari 4x4 tour. 

I have narrowed down my search for a suitable vehicle to either a Hilux Rocco or GR. 

I understand there are differences within the interior in terms of seat shape, cushions and materials of the GR. Would you guys say its better? If so in what way?

I am not too interested in the monotube dampers of the GR as I intended to upgraded straight to an Iron Man suspension set up all around with light leaf springs and new shackles and bushings etc. 

Looks wise I have no need for hammer bumpers or anything like that. I really prefer the oem/original look of the hilux. Fresh detailed and ppfd and then couples with some more capable tyres  providing a package with subtle looks and some reliable (fairly comfortable) off road/road trip ability. 

I believe the Hilux UTE is known well enough throughout the whole of Pakistan, so repairs and /or maintenance should not be an issue almost anywhere. Would you guys say thats fair?

My particular issue arises, whereby I dont want to buy new, but have a healthy budget of 1.25 to 1.35 for a Rocco and 1.4 to 1.55 for a GR. 

I visited Khalid bin Walid road, only briefly. 2 dealers, both of whom seemed shady and cars not as described. Then as we were thinking to get some coffee a man was being badly beating by 5 other men  on the opposite side of the road. 

No idea what was happening, and I hope this is not indicative of the used car dealers in general. 

I guess what I am asking for is help with 3 points.  

1. Where can I buy a decent, well looked after/loved hilux in Karachi where the mileage hasn't been tampered etc. Which yo buy Rocco or GR?

2. Are there any other cars you guys would recommend that are fairly newish/reliable and easy to sell quickly in a year or so. That would fit my criteria. 

3. Any buying tips in general. Happy to pay for a Pakwheels inspections etc, if these are any good?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1771529958.0,karachi,0,1.0,False
1r991ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1r991ye/moved_abroad_two_years_ago_and_had_to_rebuild_my/,Moved abroad two years ago and had to rebuild my entire prep mindset from scratch,"Quick background: 31F, American, relocated to Portugal for remote work about two years ago. I thought I was a reasonably prepared person back home. I had my kit, I knew my routes, I understood the systems. Then I moved and realized I had basically prepared for a country I no longer lived in.

The first thing that broke was my communication plan. My emergency contacts were all in a different timezone, my phone plan had weird gaps in rural areas, and I didn't actually know how the local emergency number system worked. In the US I know 911 like a reflex. Here I had to actively look up what number to call and when - and more importantly, whether I could communicate well enough in an emergency to actually get help. My portuguese is functional but ""functional for coffee orders"" is very different from ""functional when you're scared and something is wrong.""

The second thing was that all my stored supplies were calibrated for American products and American pharmacies. I had a list of medications by brand name that simply don't exist here under the same names. I had food stores based on familiar staples. I basically had to audit everything and start over with what was actually available locally, which was humbling.

What surprised me most was how much prep is culturally specific. A lot of the advice I'd internalized assumed car ownership, suburban space, a certain kind of infrastructure. Here I live in an apartment in a city, I don't own a car, and the risks are genuinely different - earthquake preparedness is a real thing here in a way it wasn't where I grew up. I had to stop importing American prep frameworks and actually pay attention to what locals were concerned about.

Two years in, I feel more prepared than I ever did back home, honestly. But it required letting go of the idea that I already knew what I was doing. If you're prepping in a country that isn't where you grew up, I'd really recommend starting from zero instead of trying to adapt.

“Ugh. I’ll call you back.”

A bright flash, then 8 seconds later furious thunder. Rain. That offer certainly rained on his parade. Ludicrous. Pluto was often making 15, 20 million per movie, easy. Even his 8 pups made more. The world was just unfair.

Well, he shouldn’t complain so much. The Kitty Kat scandal. Money exchanged hands. What happened in Vegas did not stay in Vegas, so now his career became Death Valley.

Five million paid for the next year’s rent and then some. The mouse picked up the phone, dialed his agent as promised.

As a dark roast lover, I'm sure it will not surprise you to know that I hate the third wave coffee movement, so thank you guys for not bending to cultural pressure and lightening all of your roasts. You and Peet's are literally the last bastions of REAL dark roast coffee left.

I generally come in and buy a bag of Verona every 2-3 weeks. You'll know it's me because I am the weirdo that pulls out every bag and sniffs it until I find the most pungent smelling one :-)  I put them back when I'm done though don't worry, lol.

Anyway, I've noticed maybe the last 10-15 bags or so seem a bit lighter roasted, noticeably less oily, and resulting in less body and aroma.  I've asked Chat GPT if Starbucks is starting to bend to third wave pressure and lighten up all their roasts a bit and it says yes, but I've learned that A.I. will agree with most anything you ask it if there is any subjectiveness there so I don't trust it.

I doubt management tells you guys, but I am curious if anyone knows if you're starting to lighten the roast times on the signature dark blends at all or if it's just my imagination?  Oil on a bean is not a sin. It's literally evidence that it was roasted to the second crack, and that IS dark roast coffee.

1r98wel,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r98wel,V-Day Gift to Myself,"I’m single and in my 30s, so for Valentine’s Day this past weekend, I decided to go record shopping and treat myself. Picked up the Stars of the Lid 30-year anniversary remaster of Music for Nitrous Oxide and (not pictured) a cheap, used copy of Robert Flack & Donny Hathaway’s collaboration album. I have also recently been running out of space, so I upgraded a wayward floor crate to a 3-tiered cart from [Etsy,](https://www.etsy.com/listing/785876747/vinyl-record-storage-triple-deck-lp) which means I can shop more now!

I long ago departed from other social media like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, and have been feeling the urge to share my collection, so here it is. 😊

Including information below in case folks are curious:

* My setup is a Marantz Model 40N Integrated Amplifier, RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII Subwoofer, Wharfedale EVO 4.1s, and a U-Turn Audio Turntable with the Ortofon 2M Blue Stylus.
* Records are organized by genre and alphabetized within genres. The genres are loose groupings and I came up with them based on vibes: Ambient/Post-Rock/Classical, Classic Rock, Electronic, Emo, Shoegaze/Dream Pop, Indie, Hip-Hop/R&B, Jazz, Miscellaneous, Pop, Post-Punk/New Wave, Rock, Soul/Blues, Singer-Songwriter. I often fight with myself over where things should go, then later get annoyed at my decisions. 😂 The dividers are from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/789431174/eco-friendly-vinyl-record-dividers). I keep the box sets separate since they’re so large.
* The record cabinet and matching coffee table are from this company on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/OceanBeachPalletCo). The random floor crates are also from Etsy.
* My collection stands at a little under 400 right now - everything is logged on my [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/vcapezio/collection).
* Please ignore the TV cord cover being off center. I messed up a long time ago and it continues to upset me. ",20,1771529557.0,vinyl,5,1.0,False

Mattel Unveils Expansive Masters of the Universe Publishing Program Ahead of the Film’s Global Theatrical Release

The multi-format slate, which is timed to the global theatrical release of Masters of the Universe from Amazon MGM Studios and Mattel Studios, spans a film-adjacent novel, original middle-grade stories, comics, and art books for fans of all ages

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Feb. 19, 2026 –  Mattel, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAT), a leading global play and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world, today announced a bold Masters of the Universe publishing program launching throughout 2026 from Mattel Press, the company’s own publishing platform, and partners. Part of a broader strategic plan to expand the franchise to new and diverse audiences worldwide across toys, film, digital experiences, consumer products, and publishing, the slate spans a film-adjacent novel, original middle-grade stories, comics, a graphic novel, and an art book, reinforcing the brand’s storytelling reach for fans of all ages.

Ryan Ferguson, Global Head of Publishing at Mattel, said: “Masters of the Universe has always been more than a single format—it’s a mythology that evolves across generations and mediums. With this publishing initiative, we aren’t just retelling the film’s story; we’re expanding the world of Eternia in ways that invite fans to go deeper and discover new facets of the universe. Through Mattel Press, we’re partnering with New York Times-bestselling authors and top creative talent to move quickly into diverse formats and reach a broader range of readers, while still delivering rich, meaningful storytelling for longtime fans. From character-driven young adult novels to manga-inspired narratives and fan-centric celebrations of the lore, this slate reflects our ambition to build Masters of the Universe into a fully realized, multi-platform franchise that resonates with fans old and new.”

Timed to the new, live-action adventure movie Masters of the Universe from Amazon MGM Studios and Mattel Studios, releasing theatrically in the U.S. on June 5, 2026, and internationally this June, the publishing program from Mattel Press brings the film to life with titles that let readers go deeper into Eternia:

He has the right face. The right voice. But he puts sugar in his coffee — and my husband always drank it black.

The Stranger in My Bed is a psychological thriller about a wife who can't prove the man in her house isn't her husband — and can't stop noticing the details that say he's not.

I had this problem earlier today, where I had to manually change the texture to be the actual texture applied to the cup.

I have looked everywhere, and there doesn't seem to be anything that would logically mean that it will always show the image actually applied to the object.

1r98sme,https://www.reddit.com/r/capmetro/comments/1r98sme/capmetro_issues/,CapMetro Issues,"Recently, I decided to get rid of my vehicle to save money and become more urban. I live pretty central so getting to places is easy and less expensive with a ride share. I decided to save even more money and reduce my footprint by riding CapMetro to and from work and other destinations.  
  
I'm a UT employee, so as a perk I can ride for free with my university ID, but I know that is not the case for many. This morning (February 19), after going to City Hall to do my civic duty and vote, I grabbed a coffee, and walked to the nearest stop (Stop ID: 5499 at the corner of W. 6th and West Ave.) for the most direct route to my office on Lake Austin Blvd. It was about a mile, fortunately I can walk that far, but again, not always the case for those who depend on public transit to get to their destinations. I was on time, and waiting near the curb at the stop. The Route 4 bus was driving faster than the other vehicles on the road, and drove right past the stop.   
  
Frustrated, I walked to the next closest stop on a more direct route, the 663, (Stop ID: 1973 at the corner of W. 6th and Pressler), another mile away. I caught the bus, and while on the bus, this bus driver skipped a stop on Lake Austin Blvd. with someone (likely a UT student, as a university employee this was quite disheartening,) clearly waiting for the bus. (Stop ID: 5825 across from the Colorado Apartments.)  
  
I sent this to CapMetro, the CapMetro board, UT Austin Parking and Transportation, and my city council member to ask for help in addressing this important issue, not just for me, but for others that depend on CapMetro for their transportation, the ones who cannot afford to use ride shares and the ones who cannot walk a mile to another stop.",7,1771529327.0,capmetro,4,1.0,False

1r98ruv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r98ruv/i_24m_have_feelings_for_a_girl_23f_i_met_online/,"I (24M) have feelings for a girl (23F) I met online, but she seems unavailable.","I’ve fallen for a girl I met online. I’m lonely, I’ve never been in a relationship or even been on a date, and I really want to have a girlfriend. I’m conservative and religious, and I’m looking for a girl who shares similar values, where family and having children would be a priority.
I came across her profile by chance and was interested because she seemed like my type. She wrote about religion, relationships, and cooking, and mentioned that she wants to get married and have kids soon. We discussed various topics several times. For a long time, I was too shy to reach out and tell her I’d like to get to know her better, but my loneliness became unbearable, and I decided I have nothing to lose and want to express my feelings. The problem is that her account is anonymous and she recently disabled the ability to write DMs to people she doesn't follow. Comments don’t feel like the right place to send personal messages either. I tried to subtly show interest in the comments, mentioning that I share similar values, that I’m single, and looking for a wife. I also tried to find her real accounts on Facebook and Instagram, but haven’t had any success. I found the Instagram accounts of several girls with whom she follows each other on X and interacts frequently. I assumed they would follow each other there as well, but after scrolling through their followers, I couldn't find a profile that could belong to her. Sometimes she shares a bit about herself and her family and posts photos, but she always hides her face, so I only have limited information. I initially assumed the name on her profile was real, but after checking local profiles, I couldn’t find anyone who fully matches. I know she studied in city X and took two courses but stopped, so I tried looking at five possible universities. Knowing her age, I narrowed it down to 2021–2025, but there are still many possibilities, especially considering full-time and part-time studies. I think part-time is more likely because she mentioned working. I spent my entire winter break searching, a few hours every day. 
I know that she lives within a radius of about 70 km from city X. I’m knowledgeable about OSINT because I'm interested in geopolitics and the military, and I used to track troop movements and geolocation as an amateur, so I decided to use this technique and my skills to find her. I really want to go on a date with her, and the more I know about her, the better my chances. She added a few photos of the area where she lives, but all you can see are nature and a few ordinary buildings with no distinguishing features, so I haven't been able to find those locations yet. She was at a restaurant with friends recently, she didn't tag the restaurant, but I managed to find it.
I think about her constantly, I can’t sleep or focus on my studies. I experience mood swings, panic attacks, periods of depression, and bursts of excitement. I’m a nerd who struggles to feel and express emotions, but for the first time in my life, I feel something very strong and unusual for her. I’m afraid she might find someone else before I reach out, and I’m also scared I won’t meet her expectations and that she will reject me. She seems very critical of men, even conservative ones, and has high standards. She expects a man to pay on a date and take her to a nice restaurant. She likes healthy, quality food, so I assume she prefers an expensive place. She mentioned that most men, even those with conservative values, aren’t suitable for a relationship, lack emotional intelligence, don’t show affection, or cheat. I assume she’s had negative experiences with men in the past and now generalizes. I would like to convince her that I am a decent guy.
I don’t know exactly what she wants, as she expects a man to be strong and decisive but also sensitive and affectionate. I want to continue trying to find her, but I’d also like to find a safe and respectful way to show my interest. How can I comment on her posts to let her know I share her values and might be interested in meeting? If I find her real account on Fb or IG and I can send her a private message, should I tell her how I feel about her? I'm afraid that if I write everything to her, she will get scared. Or maybe I should find her and approach her in person? I know she likes to hang out at coffee shops. If I knew her favorite spots and her daily schedule, I could wait for her there and try to strike up a conversation. ",1,1771529280.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Modern wellness programs are moving beyond basic health insurance to focus on five core dimensions: physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual. 

When these are prioritized, employees see higher engagement and lower stress, while companies save an average of **$3.27 in healthcare costs for every $1 spent.**

Here are the most effective ways to upgrade your workday health:

* **Strategic Movement:** Replace sedentary sessions with **walking meetings** or short office yoga breaks to improve circulation and mental clarity.
* **Brain-Power Nutrition:** Avoid the ""vending machine crash."" Stick to **high-protein, low-glycemic snacks** like nuts, Greek yogurt, or hummus and raw veggies to maintain steady energy levels.
* **The Power Nap:** Short, 20-minute rests are scientifically proven to restore focus better than a third cup of coffee.
* **Digital Boundaries:** Implement a ""Social Media Detox"" or designated ""Deep Work"" hours to protect your intellectual and emotional wellness.
* **Growth Challenges:** Join (or start) low-stakes office competitions, such as a **1-week meditation challenge** or a shared-hobby club, to build social connections and reduce isolation.

❔❔ If you could swap your office coffee machine for one wellness perk (nap pods, gym access, etc.), what would it be?

1r98rg2,https://i.redd.it/tcccevfz5ikg1.gif,(A loong Emilute Text) Kidnapping or Date,"Before we start the text, I'd like to say that what i especially like in this ship is that it won't be definitely simple.

Especially at beginning, Emilute for me is the story of overcoming bad odds and bad hands.

So, I decided to represent it the most faithfully possible, be it the bad, the good, the great and the mediocre.

And I hope you see that I tried to make it so that they're the closest to their canon personalities.

I would even add It's funny to write both of them as they both have their own flavor of strong personalities.

Here, more precisely, it's early Emilute, the moment when they take the most walls in their relation. It's rocky, messy and complicated as life can get. And It feel right to me. Hope it will be to you.

Have a fun reading session.

Addenum: Jesus is a touchy subject for Emily, but  she aboards it here though as it is a circumstance emotionnally extreme enough for her to refer to.

----------------------------------------------

Emily was minding her own business as usual in heaven. She liked to feel the wind with her winds even when she wasn't flying. It was a pity one of them was no longer here.

As her various thoughts distracted her, she didn’t notice the shadow who approached her.

With a swift and instantaneous move, the songbird was captured.

Emily woke up hearing water drip from a ceiling. She was a bit dazed and tried to move. But her movement was limited.
She felt some pressure at her arms and feet.

Then, she felt a strange contact, her muscles twitched under what appeared to be ropes.
Emily wanted to yell, but she couldn't at all as she gasped at what she saw.

A strange shadow arrived in the cave. A shadow who reeked metal, death and grief.
2 glowing eyes were staring at her.

Emily's mind was racing like a rocket.
No such bad things happens in hell, do they?

Then the light suddenly struck like a train, revealing the figure.
Emily recognized Lute at a glance.
She was... for a lack of a better word, unwell. 

Her traits were abrased and tired as if she was a minute away from getting a nap. Yet she had an energy that reminded Emily of someone swimming as hard as possible not to dive a last time in the abyss. Gravity elongated every movement, every sentence as if this exorcist forgot she had wings to fly.

Lute snapped at the moment reaching Emily like a hawk putting her claws on her.
""Now with you as my hostage, Sera will finally give me back what belong to me... be it...""

Emily's mind went blank for a few minutes as she was absolutely astonished. The feeling of danger just blew away in seconds like an overbaked cake.
She didn’t listen much the words of this reckless one. 

The sentence escaped her lips.

""That's... just... dumb""

The hawk snapped back an expression of pure ravenous fury on her face.

""What... did you... just say... ?""

The Pandora's box was open. She might as well continue on this road.

""Lute, you're an exorcist, right ? You know the difference in power between you and Adam, do you ?""

The fierce captor was a bit taken apart by the question, not exactly knowing where it would land.

""... yep, Adam was an archangel and... he was so powerful... what do…""

Instinct or maybe a hint of exasperation made the seraphim complete the sentence.

""... I mean that next to Adam, you're almost powerless. And Adam next to Lucifer is almost powerless by comparison too. Lucifer is a seraphim, albeit fallen. And, well even if not all Seraphims are on the same level of power as Lucifer or are that combat attuned, I think you can do the math""

Lute's sleep-deprived mind who only managed to hold up thanks to pure rage, coffee and her own personal mental coach -thanks Adam - started to have a rare moment of clarity which was spitted out of frustration.

""Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck""

Emily gently put the last nail in the coffin.

""And what would think will happen once everyone know I disappeared?

It's not like the angels would be able to find me thanks to the various powers that exist here in heaven""

The mind of the fierce warrior slowly unraveled as the various conflicting and failed attempts were slowly starting.

""But, and Adam... who will avenge him?
And the sinners? And the one eyed bitch traitor?

Why nothing work?!!!

No... no one get it....
The other exorcists don't want to help...
We're letting scum enter....

I tried everything and each time I meet a wall... days !! Weeks !!! Months !!!!

All wasted !!!.

I...
I..
I.

Don't they see the sinners are a danger ?
Adam... and now breaking the... gates....

Can't someone get it that I am trying to protect heaven !!!

Can't... ""

Once again, Emily's mouth acted on her own as the last sentence triggered her off, cutting Lute in her rambles.
The exorcist managed to make her genuinely angry. 

For once, the storm switched sides.

""Protector !!! Are you kidding me ?
Where were you when Sera sent you to help ?!!!
Oh, God, I know, you were trying to fight Vaggi off for your stupid revenge....

Thanks to you, I lost my wing in the process and I almost died....

I... don’t know how to deal with that Lute.

Every day, I wake up.

Nothing changed around me.

The same persons. The same routine.

Yet, I feel it pounding.

My heart. I still have nightmares of that day.

And, still people need me. They need my joy. And each day, I feel like I am lying to them. Because what happened this day in hell wasn't okay at all.

And each time, I go to hell for the hell, I am scared for my life.

And... each... time, I remember that Sera would never back down, and I continue because I have to do so. But... but..

So, don't you dare say you are a protector, nor that you value heaven's interests!!... Don’t... just... Don’t....""

As the night sky that constituted the face of the seraphim was finally conquered by rain, the metal arm suddenly slides off with a brutal yet decisive movement.
Yet her voice lost her edge.

""Then, I even failed at being a protector.""

Emily was freed and in tears. She barely sprouted a word out.

""What?

A calmer than calm voice answered softly with resignation until it stopped as the soldier let out a sigh.

""Go, you're right... do what you want... I am not worth it... and I will fail anyway...""

Emily enjoyed moving, yet stopped as something arose in her. It was a moment of strange clarity.

""I see, then I failed at my job too.""

The words pierced the clouds and reached directly the heart. 

""Em...""

The Seraphim took the lead.

""Oh, my god...

I.. I failed, because I let one person in heaven get so sad in front of me and I didn't even see it.

Or maybe, I didn't want to...

I was so conflicted with how you reacted back then. And frankly, I still don't share the same opinion as you.

But, I shouldn't have let you be like that.

I should have done something like with these exorcists I helped before.. I knew about the exterminations... but... it's different with you.

And... frankly... I... didn’t know that feeling like I know it today.

This sensation, this cold burning...

This is eating at you even right now ?""

Only a silence was heard as an answer.
The purple robed girl then answered to all that moment meant as words couldn't convey what was going beyond the acts and the exchange.

""Listen to me...
I won't denounce you under one condition.
You will work under me, effective from now on and I will closely have my attention on you at any moments.

Do any suspicious things, or try to get away and with what happened right now, you will be made fallen, I'll guarantee you that.

Never.. Ever.. Take my kindness for weakness. 

Don’t forget that even if I lived in heaven, it was for eons.

But as my friend Jesus said, it starts with sorry. And you deserve a chance...""

The hawk like girl simply nodded being taken aback by her attitude to be even more confused as the seraphim tightly put her arms around her. She softly whispered.

""What... that... is ?""

The high Seraphim who didn't let the hold fade away now simply let her conviction speak for herself, although there was some remaining anger in her voice.

""Mandatory hug session, you dumb bitch !!""

Emily then gasped cursing her potty mouth while Lute was a bit delighted at the situation. She shot a snarky remark.

""Great, I thought you were a capable leader for a moment""

""Luuuute....""

""Then show me. It's not like I have nothing left to do. You hold the cards, dear...""

-------

Time passed.
A decade later, Lute and Emily after what can only be called a roller coaster on an emotional level were finally happy together.

This cheerful one was probably an alchemist too as she showed Lute how all her bad traits could be great without even really trying. Lute even came to cherish every moment with her other half be they bad or good.

The former exorcist looked lovingly at her pendant. Some part was made of the rope that served to tie Emily back then.
And this was their secret...

What a crazy story to tell, don't you think?

But what made her smile was the fact that the inscription reads:
""To make better use even of bad days""
Frankly, Emily will always be Emily. 

And nothing can handle that true character of her.

Then, her mind clicked about the exorcists she helped. 

Small gestures of kindness from someone who didn't know the exterminations back then. She did precise a bit more after their first true encounter.

The timeline clicks too. Some exorcists were less and less enthusiasts about her jobs. This ended up in demotions, and then it culminated in Vaggi's rebellion.

The thought came to struck in her mind.
Emily probably set up the long chain of dominos with her usual kindness without even knowing it.

Lute was tempted to talk of that to her, but she knows her soulmate will always get back to her with that. So, she chuckled a bit.

A confused seraphim in a night dress arrived for dinner. Stress were eating her up away as she was overpreparing.

""Lute, why are you laughing ? And we’re so going to be laaaaaaaate....""

Lute closed the pendant satisfied with an enigmatic smile.

The comforting arms of the fierce women closely melted the worries of the 6 winged beauty as it did many times through storms and traumas.

1r98p59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1r98p59/i_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_we_made_up_and_im/,"I cheated on my boyfriend, we made up, and I’m thinking about doing it again","I know the title makes me sound terrible. And I am. I get it. I never understood how someone could cheat on their SO. Until it happened to me. 

My boyfriend, M27, and I , F25, have been together for 2 years. We’ll call current boyfriend John. About a year into the relationship with John, I started to have an emotional connection with another man. We’ll call him Trevor. Yes he is more attractive than my current partner. Way more attractive. When I say this man is like the guy from “Reacher” he is, but think the dark version of him. Dark hair, brown eyes, super muscular, and super into me. I think that’s what drew me in at first. Not to mention he’s 6’2 and John is 5’8”. I’m 5’7” pushing 5’8” so it makes a hell if a difference for me. I met him at work, so I would see him every day. The more I got to know him, the harder it was to say no when he would try to get me to go out with him. Finally I said yes. We went on a couple walks with his dog, went out for coffee, drinks a couple times, and I even slept over at Trevor’s house once. However, nothing physical happened. We did however sleep in the same bed…

But never had sex, I’ve never even kissed this guy. 

My current boyfriend John is a sweetheart. He is exactly what I’ve always wanted. He loves me unconditionally. Gives me whatever I ask for. He really is too good to me. He doesn’t drink, doesn’t smoke, doesn’t even cuss. He is an all around good guy. My family loves him. My mother literally today described him as “the kind of guy you want your daughter to end up with”. However, there’s been a drift in our relationship recently.

It’s mainly my fault. I was off and on with Trevor, giving him hope and then telling him “sorry I’m in a committed relationship with John.” Well, he still never gave up hope. My feelings for Trevor have only grown, and it’s getting really hard to be with John.

I actually told John a few weeks ago about Trevor. He didn’t take it well. But when I have feelings for another man but still love John, it was getting unbearable and I had to tell him. Maybe out of guilt, maybe because he is such a good guy that he deserves to know. But I had to tell him. I spent the night at my parents the day I told him. And I missed him so bad I made up with him the next day. Now, we spend even more time together. I told him I was starting to feel unattracted to him because he stopped working out and watching what he was eating, therefore gaining a few pounds. There’s a part of me that doesn’t like that he’s the same size as me. Anyways, John and I have been doing great these past few weeks ever since I told him. However, he wants me to leave my job because of Trevor. I put in my 2 weeks literally 2 days before I got offered a management position and part of me resents him for that. I take pride in my job and was working toward that the entire time I worked there.

He is willing to support me while I don’t have a job, but I don’t know how that will go. I still have feelings for Trevor. When I talked to my boyfriend about this, I may have sugarcoated it a bit. I lied about how long it was going on. I told him we never did anything physical, but I didn’t tell him about sleeping in the same bed. And the past few days, I’ve been texting Trevor again. That and flirting with him subtly at work. I don’t know why I do this, it’s like there’s a part of me when he’s around that just can’t control itself. I feel like either way I choose, there will always be a part of myself wondering “what if” towards the other guy. John treats me like a princess, but I don’t feel physically attracted to him. I am very much attracted to Trevor, but then again, I’m not in a relationship with him and don’t know 100% how it would be. I’ve been in abusive relationships before, and don’t want that again. I don’t think he would be like that, but it’s always the ones you never expect.

Also, I live with John. Have been for about a year, and about to sign onto another year lease with him. Please give me advice on what to do before I go through with that. I’ve never been in this situation and don’t know anyone who has. I really don’t want to move back I with my parents, but seeing as how I quit my job for John, I can’t afford a place by myself. I’m in a predicament to say the least.",0,1771529117.0,cheating_stories,8,0.23,False

Said broadcast is “Nora at Night”, a late night music and call-in radio show hosted by Nora Woods (status unknown) between 2300 and 0200 central time on 10/03/2025. The broadcast would be the last made by the station. Pitsham itself would be quarantined later that night owing to what state officials have classified as an “unknown chemical contamination”. The quarantine is yet to be lifted.

Transcript 

*Intro jingle plays*

Nora Woods: Good Evening, Pitsham! Welcome back to “Nora at Night”, coming at you live from our very own KBSE. I, as ever, am your host, Nora Woods, keeping all you nighthawks company on this beautiful October evening. Now I know a lot our listeners are working the night shift right now, me included. So, since it’s October, we’re wondering what’s the spookiest thing you’ve seen on a night shift? Any faces in your coffee? Strange figures in the bar bathroom? Our lines are now open, but first, here’s a classic to get you in the mood.

*Call Me by Blondie plays in full*

NW: That was Blondie with Call Me, and call me you did. We’ve got Mitch on the line, how you doing tonight, Mitch?

Mitch: Hi Nora, I’m alright, pleasure to be here.

NW: The pleasure’s all ours, Mitch. Now tell me, what is it you do for a living?

M: I’m a trucker.

NW: Backbone of our society. You hauling right now, Mitch?

M: Uh, yeah, but don’t worry, I got you on the uh, the Bluetooth.

NW: Well, that’s good to know, Mitch, wouldn’t want you distracted at the helm of an eighteen-wheeler. So, you got any eerie tales from the road?

M: Oh, most definitely. Well uh, everyone, every trucker, they’ve got their stories, I don’t put too much stock in most of them, considering who’s telling them, if you, uh, catch my drift *\*chuckles\**.

NW: Think they’ve been hitting the perk pills too hard, Mitch?

M: Exactly! *\*chuckles\** Exactly. But uh, y’know, like I said, we’ve all got our stories. There was this one time, and this was a good few years ago now, but I was hauling up there around the Nebraska state line, middle of the night, uh, cornfields either side of me, nothing but miles of cornfields. So, I’m driving, and I see this flash of white from the right. It was a gir- er, a young woman… pale as cod meat, stark naked, sprinting out from the corn and into the road.

NW: Gosh!

M: So I slam on the brakes, I can’t help but shut my eyes, I think “oh sh- uh, darn, I must have hit her”. I get out of the cab, I look around but I can’t find no trace of her, like she vanished.

NW: Could she have ran into the corn?

M: I suppose, but remember these are miles of cornfields, miles. I don’t know where she could have ran from or where she could have gone. I just hope she ended up safe, wherever she went.

NW: I’m with you there, Mitch. But Y’know, Mitch, some of our listeners are gonna be wondering if you were taking any of those perk pills that night…”

M: *\*Chuckles\** Oh no, I was uh, going on four years sober at that point.

NW: No kidding, you still sober these days?

M: Yes Ma’am, twenty years as of last month.

NW: That’s wonderful to hear, Mitch, you’re an inspiration.

M: Aw shucks *\*chuckles\** You’re making me blush, Nora. Thanks for having me. 

NW: Thank you for calling in, you have a good night now.

*Phone call ends*

NW: That was trucker Mitch, a man I would be honoured to buy a non-alcoholic beer for if I ever get the chance. We’ve got more callers on the line waiting to tell us their spooky night shift stories, until then, here’s a word from our sponsors followed right up by the Boss, right here on KBSE.

NW: That was Dancing in the Dark by Bruce Springsteen. Okay, we’ve got Kevin on the line with us, Kevin, you’re on air.

Kevin: Oh, uh, hi. Hi, Nora.

NW: Hi there, Kevin, how are you tonight?

K: I’m… yeah, I’m okay. How are you?

NW: I’m good, Kevin, I’m good. You got a story for us?

K: Oh, yeah, uh… so I’m a delivery driver, I’m actually still on shift right now. And… well, actually this story is from a couple hours ago.

NW: Oh wow, how serendipitous!

K: Yeah, uh… so I was delivering a package to this house and I needed someone to sign for it. I know it’s a little late but it was marked next day delivery and the lights were on, so I thought, y’know. Anyway, uh, I ring the doorbell and wait a while, no answer, ring it again, no answer. I loo- I don’t usually do this, but I looked in the window, see if anyone was home.

NW: And was there?

K: Yeah. I mean, there was a woman. Maybe like forty? In her pyjamas. Stood there, staring at the wall.

NW: What was she staring at?

K: I mean, nothing. Not that I could see. She was maybe an inch from the wallpaper, just sort of… I don’t know, listing from side to side. I knocked on the window, but she just… I don’t know, she just stayed there. 

NW: You sure she heard you?

K: I mean, I would have to assume so.

NW: Sounds like something out of Blair Witch.

K: So anyway, I get back in my car, and I drive to the end of the street, and then I heard this scream. Like this howling scream.

NW: A scream? You think it was the woman at the house?

K: I don’t know, but the whole thing just put me on edge.

NW: I’m not surprised, Kevin. Hopefully the rest of your shift won’t be as unsettling.

K: Yeah, hopefully.

NW: Stay safe out there, Kevin.

*Phone call ends*

NW: That was our local delivery driver Kevin with a story where he’s peering in lady’s windows and is somehow not the creepiest part of it. This one’s for you, Kev.

NW: That was Billy Idol with Eyes Without A Face. Our next caller is Nurse Rachael, calling us from Pitsham General tonight. Rachael, you’re live.

Rachael: Hello? Am I on?

NW: You sure are, Rachael, you got any horror stories from late night in the hospital?

R: No, I mean… this is about what the young man was saying earlier? The delivery driver?

NW: Oh sure, what’s your medical opinion, Rachael?

R: I don’t know, but I’m at the hospital right now and… well, what he was describing were seeing it here.

NW: Sorry, Rachael, seeing what exactly?

R: We’re seeing… I’m not sure how to describe it. Dissociative symptoms, confusion, lack of motor control, volatility. *\*Screaming, shouting heard in background\*.* The waiting room here is… I mean, we’re absolutely swamped here. 

NW: I’m sorry, Rachael, did you say volatility? Are these individuals dangerous?

R: No, not necessarily. Most are completely docile, but we’ve seen, uh… rapid mood swings among those showing symptoms.

NW: Do you know what this is? What’s happening?

R: I mean… I can’t explain it. I’ve seen similar symptoms in dementia patients but that can’t be spread obviously. The patients we’re seeing here aren’t at the expected age you’d expect to see this kind of cognitive decline, I mean the youngest person I’ve seen with symptoms is seven years old.

NW: So no one knows what this could be?

R: I mean, the doctors here are- *\*Guttural howl in background\** sorry, I uh… the doctors here think it could be an environmental thing? A gas leak, something in the water. I mean, we really don’t know…

NW: Sorry to cut in, Rachael, but my producer is telling me to state for the record that KBSE can neither confirm nor deny any claims that there is any kind of environmental… um… event happening that is cause for concern.

R: Okay, but look, I’ve been a nurse fifteen years now and I know when something bad is happening. 

NW: I don’t doubt that, Rachael. Do you have any advice for listeners at home?

R: Stay home. Watch out for any strange behaviour. Don’t come to the hospital.

NW: I’m sorry, Rachael, can y-

*Phone call ends*

NW: Oh, it, uh… it looks like Rachael has hung up on us. Um… let’s cut to commercial and get some tunes on, it appears my producer is wav- uhp, she doesn’t want me to- okay, we’ll be right back, listeners, stay tuned.

NW: Sorry Listeners, but we’re going to have to interrupt our usual programming for the time being. We just received a message from the county sheriff regarding a developing situation that I’ve been instructed to read out for you now. The message is as follows: “Residents of Pitsham as well as the surrounding Maff County are instructed to shelter in place. Local and state government has been made aware of an unknown contagion in the area. In order to halt any potential spread of this contagion, a quarantine is now in effect for Maff county.

C: This… this thing that’s happening, I’ve seen it before. At the Selwyn abattoir, north of town.It’s been happening for months now. The animals, they… I don’t know, it started a few months ago. First only a couple of cows, then we started seeing it in the pigs, even the chickens… everything.

NW: Seeing what, Chris? The contagion?

C: What that nurse was talking about, the shambling, the confusion… we’ve been seeing it in the animals for months. 

NW: What happened to the animals, Chris?

C: They… they would always die after a few days. If we didn’t kill them first.

Some context: me (25f) and my partner (29m) have been living together for 7 years and have always had a traditional value relationship. I do the cooking, cleaning and everything in the household and he pays more of the rent (70/30). We both work 9-5. 

A few years ago I told him that i grew up saying thanks to my mum for every meal every night and I would appreciate him doing so as well. He Said its weird but ok. He did so all these years and I am thankful for that. A couple months ago he told me he doesnt want to do it since it makes him feel like I am his master and he then sees himself below me in that situation. This then turned into a fight. Afterwards I told him if its that big of a deal for him, he can just stop saying it. He then said no because you will be mad if I dont. That back and forth annoyed me so I was like ok so be it if it doesnt come from the heart its whatever anyway. 

He kept doing it after that fight until Today where he said its unbelievable to still expect this from him after all this time and going off on me and started screaming around. And I just said: but I told you last time you dont have to keep doing it if you dont feel it, but you didnt accept that. So now I am kind of lost on what to say to him? 

Also I say thank you to literally everything he does. Dropped me of at the Train Station? Thank you. Treated me to a Coffee? Thank you. Took out the trash? Thank you. Treated me for a meal? Thank you.

His Argument is you dont say thank you every month when I Pay more rent - which is fair- I dont…

So all this said, Am I the asshole for wanting a simple thanks after I cooked us dinner?

Addenum: Jesus is a touchy subject for Emily, but  she aboards it here though as it is a circumstance emotionnally extreme enough for her to refer to.

----------------------------------------------

Emily was minding her own business as usual in heaven. She liked to feel the wind with her winds even when she wasn't flying. It was a pity one of them was no longer here.

As her various thoughts distracted her, she didn’t notice the shadow who approached her.

With a swift and instantaneous move, the songbird was captured.

Emily woke up hearing water drip from a ceiling. She was a bit dazed and tried to move. But her movement was limited.
She felt some pressure at her arms and feet.

Then, she felt a strange contact, her muscles twitched under what appeared to be ropes.
Emily wanted to yell, but she couldn't at all as she gasped at what she saw.

A strange shadow arrived in the cave. A shadow who reeked metal, death and grief.
2 glowing eyes were staring at her.

Emily's mind was racing like a rocket.
No such bad things happens in hell, do they?

Then the light suddenly struck like a train, revealing the figure.
Emily recognized Lute at a glance.
She was... for a lack of a better word, unwell. 

Her traits were abrased and tired as if she was a minute away from getting a nap. Yet she had an energy that reminded Emily of someone swimming as hard as possible not to dive a last time in the abyss. Gravity elongated every movement, every sentence as if this exorcist forgot she had wings to fly.

Lute snapped at the moment reaching Emily like a hawk putting her claws on her.
""Now with you as my hostage, Sera will finally give me back what belong to me... be it...""

Emily's mind went blank for a few minutes as she was absolutely astonished. The feeling of danger just blew away in seconds like an overbaked cake.
She didn’t listen much the words of this reckless one. 

The sentence escaped her lips.

""That's... just... dumb""

The hawk snapped back an expression of pure ravenous fury on her face.

""What... did you... just say... ?""

The Pandora's box was open. She might as well continue on this road.

""Lute, you're an exorcist, right ? You know the difference in power between you and Adam, do you ?""

The fierce captor was a bit taken apart by the question, not exactly knowing where it would land.

""... yep, Adam was an archangel and... he was so powerful... what do…""

Instinct or maybe a hint of exasperation made the seraphim complete the sentence.

""... I mean that next to Adam, you're almost powerless. And Adam next to Lucifer is almost powerless by comparison too. Lucifer is a seraphim, albeit fallen. And, well even if not all Seraphims are on the same level of power as Lucifer or are that combat attuned, I think you can do the math""

Lute's sleep-deprived mind who only managed to hold up thanks to pure rage, coffee and her own personal mental coach -thanks Adam - started to have a rare moment of clarity which was spitted out of frustration.

""Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck""

Emily gently put the last nail in the coffin.

""And what would think will happen once everyone know I disappeared?

It's not like the angels would be able to find me thanks to the various powers that exist here in heaven""

The mind of the fierce warrior slowly unraveled as the various conflicting and failed attempts were slowly starting.

""But, and Adam... who will avenge him?
And the sinners? And the one eyed bitch traitor?

Why nothing work?!!!

No... no one get it....
The other exorcists don't want to help...
We're letting scum enter....

I tried everything and each time I meet a wall... days !! Weeks !!! Months !!!!

All wasted !!!.

I...
I..
I.

Don't they see the sinners are a danger ?
Adam... and now breaking the... gates....

Can't someone get it that I am trying to protect heaven !!!

Can't... ""

Once again, Emily's mouth acted on her own as the last sentence triggered her off, cutting Lute in her rambles.
The exorcist managed to make her genuinely angry. 

For once, the storm switched sides.

""Protector !!! Are you kidding me ?
Where were you when Sera sent you to help ?!!!
Oh, God, I know, you were trying to fight Vaggi off for your stupid revenge....

Thanks to you, I lost my wing in the process and I almost died....

I... don’t know how to deal with that Lute.

Every day, I wake up.

Nothing changed around me.

The same persons. The same routine.

Yet, I feel it pounding.

My heart. I still have nightmares of that day.

And, still people need me. They need my joy. And each day, I feel like I am lying to them. Because what happened this day in hell wasn't okay at all.

And each time, I go to hell for the hell, I am scared for my life.

And... each... time, I remember that Sera would never back down, and I continue because I have to do so. But... but..

So, don't you dare say you are a protector, nor that you value heaven's interests!!... Don’t... just... Don’t....""

As the night sky that constituted the face of the seraphim was finally conquered by rain, the metal arm suddenly slides off with a brutal yet decisive movement.
Yet her voice lost her edge.

""Then, I even failed at being a protector.""

Emily was freed and in tears. She barely sprouted a word out.

""What?

A calmer than calm voice answered softly with resignation until it stopped as the soldier let out a sigh.

""Go, you're right... do what you want... I am not worth it... and I will fail anyway...""

Emily enjoyed moving, yet stopped as something arose in her. It was a moment of strange clarity.

""I see, then I failed at my job too.""

The words pierced the clouds and reached directly the heart. 

""Em...""

The Seraphim took the lead.

""Oh, my god...

I.. I failed, because I let one person in heaven get so sad in front of me and I didn't even see it.

Or maybe, I didn't want to...

I was so conflicted with how you reacted back then. And frankly, I still don't share the same opinion as you.

But, I shouldn't have let you be like that.

I should have done something like with these exorcists I helped before.. I knew about the exterminations... but... it's different with you.

And... frankly... I... didn’t know that feeling like I know it today.

This sensation, this cold burning...

This is eating at you even right now ?""

Only a silence was heard as an answer.
The purple robed girl then answered to all that moment meant as words couldn't convey what was going beyond the acts and the exchange.

""Listen to me...
I won't denounce you under one condition.
You will work under me, effective from now on and I will closely have my attention on you at any moments.

Do any suspicious things, or try to get away and with what happened right now, you will be made fallen, I'll guarantee you that.

Never.. Ever.. Take my kindness for weakness. 

Don’t forget that even if I lived in heaven, it was for eons.

But as my friend Jesus said, it starts with sorry. And you deserve a chance...""

The hawk like girl simply nodded being taken aback by her attitude to be even more confused as the seraphim tightly put her arms around her. She softly whispered.

""What... that... is ?""

The high Seraphim who didn't let the hold fade away now simply let her conviction speak for herself, although there was some remaining anger in her voice.

""Mandatory hug session, you dumb bitch !!""

Emily then gasped cursing her potty mouth while Lute was a bit delighted at the situation. She shot a snarky remark.

""Great, I thought you were a capable leader for a moment""

""Luuuute....""

""Then show me. It's not like I have nothing left to do. You hold the cards, dear...""

-------

Time passed.
A decade later, Lute and Emily after what can only be called a roller coaster on an emotional level were finally happy together.

This cheerful one was probably an alchemist too as she showed Lute how all her bad traits could be great without even really trying. Lute even came to cherish every moment with her other half be they bad or good.

The former exorcist looked lovingly at her pendant. Some part was made of the rope that served to tie Emily back then.
And this was their secret...

What a crazy story to tell, don't you think?

But what made her smile was the fact that the inscription reads:
""To make better use even of bad days""
Frankly, Emily will always be Emily. 

And nothing can handle that true character of her.

Then, her mind clicked about the exorcists she helped. 

Small gestures of kindness from someone who didn't know the exterminations back then. She did precise a bit more after their first true encounter.

The timeline clicks too. Some exorcists were less and less enthusiasts about her jobs. This ended up in demotions, and then it culminated in Vaggi's rebellion.

The thought came to struck in her mind.
Emily probably set up the long chain of dominos with her usual kindness without even knowing it.

Lute was tempted to talk of that to her, but she knows her soulmate will always get back to her with that. So, she chuckled a bit.

A confused seraphim in a night dress arrived for dinner. Stress were eating her up away as she was overpreparing.

""Lute, why are you laughing ? And we’re so going to be laaaaaaaate....""

Lute closed the pendant satisfied with an enigmatic smile.

The comforting arms of the fierce women closely melted the worries of the 6 winged beauty as it did many times through storms and traumas.

It’s often the hidden sugar lurking in ""healthy"" foods like flavored yogurt, pasta sauce, and salad dressings. Taking a 30-day break from added sugar isn't just about weight—it’s a total metabolic reset that can fix your sleep, energy, and even your taste buds.

**The ""Yes"" list for 30-day no-sugar challenge:**

* **Breakfast:** Scrambled eggs with spinach and peppers, unsweetened Greek yogurt with seeds, or oatmeal topped with cinnamon and nut butter.
* **Lunch:** Grilled salmon or chicken with quinoa, chickpea salads with olive oil/lemon, or tofu stir-fry with plenty of greens.
* **Dinner:** Zucchini noodles with white beans and shrimp, bean-based stews, or baked chicken with roasted root vegetables (potatoes are okay!).
* **Snacks:** Apple slices with nut butter, hard-boiled eggs, hummus with raw carrots, or a handful of raw walnuts.
* **Drinks:** Sparkling water, black coffee, and herbal teas.

I had what I self diagnosed as an inflamed stomach. All the usual symptons, lack of appetite, poor sleep, spicy food and coffee made it worse, bland foods made it better, stomach felt irritated etc. Seemed to be going on for weeks to a degree. I think stress and over-eating heavy foods a possible cause.

I tried eating bland which certainly helped. Next thing I was going to try was raw cabbage juice for sure. However, I also started drinking a bottle of real unflavoured probiotic kefir a day. Now on paper and in my experience heavy foods (like alot of dairy) made the symptoms worse, but the kefir seem to be ok.

Anyway I noticed a significant shift in a couple of days, and in a couple of weeks it certainly seems in remission. Maybe the probiotics helped, not sure.

I now naturally avoid coffee, over eating, chilli etc, but still keep up the kefir (although I make it myself now)

He meets new hires a few times a year and asked each of us to bring one question.

When it was my turn, I asked whether being a generalist or a specialist is better for someone who eventually wants to move into the leadership track.

He paused and said he has issues with the question, and mentioned it ties into a “cultural problem” where people focus on status and money instead of being strong professionals first.

Before he even answered, he asked me why I want leadership. I gave an honest answer (responsibility, opportunities, and joked about the higher pay), but it didn’t land. His advice was basically: “don’t aim for leadership, just be excellent at what you do.”

At the end, he made a point to ask my name again and made sure he remembered it, and now I can’t tell if that was good or bad.

Gandolfo stocked shelves and did deliveries at the shop as a teenager. The family’s butcher shop has since closed, but about twenty years ago, Gandolfo moved to this neck of Brooklyn to stay. After a series of non-neighborhood ventures (Malatesta in the West Village, Jimmy’s in Williamsburg), in 2021 he opened the popular pasta spot Macosa Trattoria over on Tompkins and then, late last summer, with his best friend Colin “Cookie” Hagendorf, Gandolfo began living his longtime dream of running a diner in his beloved Bed-Stuy.  
  
“This is the food that I love the most,” he reminisced to Hell Gate while we scarfed a table’s-worth of dishes. “These are the places where I had some of my best experiences growing up: Drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, waxing philosophical deep into the night. Post party, we hit a diner. Post show at ABC No Rio or Good/Bad Art Collective? Always a diner.”  
  
Sal & Cookie’s Ultra Fine Diner (“The Original House of Quality”) is only open until 4:00 p.m. for now, so no late-night waxing can be had as of yet, nor can you smoke. But the vibe, the decor, and especially the food at Ultra Fine will make local diner lovers feel right at home.

\[We open on muffled, emphatic knocking against a door.\] 



(*Muffled*) Mikey? Dude, are you in there? I’ve been called for, like, half an hour now, man. We’re going to be late, and Finn is going to be so pissed! I don’t want to hear his bullshit, so let’s go-



\[We hear a door open.\]



(*Unmuffled, surprised, polite*) Oh. Hi. You’re not Mikey. He still lives here, right? I was just here two days ago. 



Oh, cool! Sorry about all the yelling… and the banging. He didn’t tell me he was having guests over. Can I come in?



\[We hear footsteps and the door closing.\]



Thanks. Sorry to bother, but I’m going to have to steal him for the night. We’ve got plans that we can’t miss. I’d see if we can invite you along, but it’s our high school reunion and the people running it are being real sticklers about only alumni attending.



(*Perking up*) Oh, yeah? What year were you in? Shit, were you in ours? I’m the fucking worst with faces. 



(*Confused*) I am- I am serious. Were we close? You’ve gotta remember I wasn’t very smart in high school and realize it’s only gotten worse. 



\[You pause.\] 



Sprout…?



(*Delighted*) Oh, shit, Sprout!



\[You laugh, and we hear a shuffling to indicate you hugged the listener.\]



I don’t care that’s not your name. I’ve been calling you Sprout as long as I can remember, and that’s not changing. Fuck, how have you been, little dude? You’re all grown up now! I haven’t seen you since… What, since you graduated and went to school abroad? How are you? 



No, he didn’t, that bastard! Last I heard, you were getting settled in your new place and new job– in your field, no less. Great fucking job!



Of course he told me. Mikey is so proud of you, Sprout; him and your parents talk about you all the time. You know, I helped him pick out and do up that ugly painting he got you for your apartment. 



\[You laugh.\]



Hey, you should be thanking me. It was either the Rockwell landscape or the sad, menacing clown. Would you have preferred the clown after the carnival incident?



That’s what I thought; you’re welcome. 



Nah, the additions were a group effort; I can’t take credit for that. Did he not tell you? Mikey practically made a party out of it. We went to your parents’ house. He ordered pizza. He taught your mom how to do the graffiti S-thing. Your dad practiced drawing the poop emoji in preparation, and I drew exactly fifteen, tiny, hidden dicks. 



No, you counted fourteen, big difference. Look harder and stay sharp, Sprout. 



\[You chuckle.\]



Are you in town for your mom’s birthday next week?



It’s so fucking nice to be able to come home with PTO and big kid money, right?



It’s the best! It feels like you can buy whatever you want, whenever you want, and you’ll be fine. You got a plane ticket home; I got a sword. 



No, I’m being serious, I bought a sword– a real, honest to God, metal Messer with a leather scabbard to match. It cost my entire first paycheck and a good chunk of my second, and it was so worth it. 



Hold it. Love it. Vaguely imagine taking down a home invader with it before I realize that’s a crazy to think about. I’ll bring it by sometime before you leave as long as you promise not to let Mikey anywhere near it. He’s been threatening to steal it for ages.



Yeah, well, you’re not eleven and annoying anymore, so I think you can be trusted. Don’t make me regret it. 



No, you were absolutely annoying, and that’s okay. That wasn’t your fault; you were eleven. Eleven year olds are, by design, the fucking worst. Have you hung out with a preteen recently? They’re the devil. My niece called me “unc” the other week, and my brother would even ground her for me, the asshole.



Bullshit, you absolutely called me names. I’m older than you, but I’m not old; I remember things. You used to call me really dumb shit too like butthead, shitstain… turdmonger! You called me a turd-monger once when I got the front seat before you did. What even is a turd-monger?



\[You laugh before coughing and sputtering.\]



(*Surprised*) What?



I did NOT know-!



I didn’t! How was I supposed to? You barely tolerated me, I barely tolerated you. I was at your house all the time, eating all your food, stealing your books, but I picked you up from school once I got my license and bought you fries when I got McDonalds. It was a carefully crafted balance of animosity and boredom. 



(*Dumbfounded*) Huh. Wow.



Thank… you? 



(*Flustered*) I don’t know, dude! What do I say here? My best friend’s younger sibling saunters back into town, all hot and grown and shit, and tells me they used to have a crush on me? I’m supposed to know how to respond to that mildly life-changing information? 



\[You laugh.\] 



(*Recovering, playful*) Oh, shut the fuck up. You know you’re fucking hot. Look at you! Do you think Mikey is the one who got the good looks in your family? That dweeb?



You’re totally welcome to tell him I said that. Of the things that are going on here, between us, in his living room, that is the least likely to get me in trouble. 



Something he’s not going to like, that’s for sure. 



Oh, he’s going to know. 



He will. One, you have never, since the day you were born, been able to hide something from him. Two, if I’m dating someone as gorgeous as you, I will not be anything less than obnoxious.



I don’t know; is it? 



Well, I asked second. 



\[You chuckle.\] 



We’ve known each other for so long, and you’re still so easy to rile up. I like that about you.



I don’t know; you don’t have a partner waiting back home or something, do you?



Can I still call you Sprout?



\[You laugh.\]



I knew it! I knew you actually liked that nickname, you fuck. Come here-!



\[Cue a kiss, a pause, a chuckle, and then another kiss.\] 



(*Close*) Here, put in your number. We’ll go out tomorrow for coffee or dinner or something… maybe ice cream, just you and me, like old times. Or drinks! We can both legally drink now. Are you still a lightweight? Should I keep the Seagrams away from you and my car?



Mhmm, I’ll believe it when I see it. I-



\[We hear footsteps, some sort of sound to signify Mikey coming in.\] 



(*Matter-of-fact, aside*) Getting Sprout’s number so I can take them out on a date. Why? Got a problem with that? And think carefully, Michael.



\[You pause.\]



(*Pleased*) That’s what I thought. Now get a move on… and a shirt! We’re going to be so fucking late, dude! (*Direct*) Do you ever wonder if one of you was adopted? It’s so much more believable than you being related to that doofus. 



(*Aside, hollering*) You were supposed to hear it, dipshit! I’ve got a new favorite in your family, and you’re going to deal with it!

But this morning I ventured out, coffee in hand, and upon arriving two other quad skaters were already there, obviously mother and daughter. The girl was maybe 11 or 12, and quite good! Pompoms on her toes, she glided gracefully around the turns with hand movements that reminded me of an Olympic figure skater. Mom was more of a beginner, but solid on her balance, and you could just tell they were throughly enjoying each other's company, rolling through the sunshine together. 

  
By the time I'd laced up, the ladies were already lacing down, so I came over to compliment the young girl before they left - much to my surprise, the mom let me know her inspiration for getting on wheels herself was ME! - she'd seen me skate there before and told herself if ""that lady"" could do it, she could too.

Basically another friend of mine, Simone gave me a heads up about a client that was looking for someone to do an hour a week that she couldn't manage. Simone runs her own business and has become quite successful and knew I wanted to a chance to do some freelance. Only once a week but a little extra money. Anyway I wasn't going to be able to do it until about a month but passed on Clara's details as I thought she might be interested. Clara was pretty excited by this and thanked me extensively for passing on the details. It's a good opportunity to make a reputation and get more work. 

Anyway a week later it turns out Clara wouldn't be a able to do the day of the week the client wanted so they would rather have the day they wanted but wait for me to become available. Simone has told Clara she will contact her next time a client becomes available. 

I met up with Clara yesterday for coffee and she was pretty bummed out by it not happening. She said she had got pretty far in arranging days and times with Simone as Simone had said the client would be happy to do another day. And Clara had started doing some research for the job to prepare and was ready to move forward. She said she felt really deflated that it fell through. I then told her that I assumed it fell through as I was taking the client on. 
At this point she got really sad and, I think, over the top low about it. Saying that she should never have got her hopes up and that of course I got it as I get everything. She 'joked' that I had stolen her opportunity. 
I admittedly got pretty defensive about this and pointed out I had been the one to get her this opportunity in the first place and that it wasn't my fault she was unavailable. I tried to reassure her that Simone would think of her in the future but Clara was pretty negative and said she knows nothing will come of it and she wished she hadn't had her hopes raised. The rest of the meet up was awkward and we parted pretty soon after. 

My problem is that I now do feel a bit guilty. I had assumed Clara would be fine and would congratulate me. She has never been anything but supportive of me before and is honestly a great friend so I'm upset by her reaction and a bit annoyed. I now feel like it's tainted and I've now argued with my friend for the first time in 10 years. My husband has told me he doesn't think I'm an ahole but that he can see why Clara might think I am. This was yesterday and I haven't spoken to her since and we usually message each other every day.

It should be exciting but I'm honestly not excited at all. My main issue is that I'm at the point where I'm an adult and I'm growing a lot emotionally, but I'm in a very hard situation. For refrence, I am a trans woman, so take that as you will, and I live in Utah. Already a pretty bad start, but the main point is that I have so much that I am stressed about. My family isn't supportive and have forced me to go back in the closet, I'm currently interviewing for jobs but I dont have one, and I dont have any money saved, I dont have a single friend or person I can exist around or ask for emotional support and I run my own club at my High school, I'm on track to graduate but it's still a lot, I have no connections and I'm not going to college and putting all my effort in trying to move out due to the unsafe environment for me at home. 

It's all just a lot, which is partially my fault and I'm okay to admit that, but I also have nothing to look forward to or anyone to talk to each day. The stress is my own problem and I'm dealing with it, but I wish I had someone to talk to, someone to go get a coffee with or just ways to meet new people. I've tried a lot of things like I said, I run my own club at school, I've gone to game stores or to LGBTQ spaces but they feel so therapy coded and not genuine. I feel like I'm failing so bad at life and that I'm going nowhere and this just causes more depression. 

TLDR, I just dont know how to meet people that I can genuienly bond with and grow to care about. I think it would help me a lot to have someone to talk to, not necessarily about my problems but more of a friend or partner. So many people my age already have friends or are in college or just value family/religion since I'm in Utah, and being trans obviously makes it even harder. I'm not sure anyone has any good advice for me, but if you do, then thank you so much in advance.",1,1771527498.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

1r97x7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1r97x7n/newport_bay_club_review/,Newport Bay Club review,"I just got back from a 3 night stay at NBC Hotel - normal level, not Club.

First impressions - it smelled amazing! But it was like a zoo when we arrived on a Sunday (15th Feb 2026) about 5pm, it appeared to be mainly people collecting baggage and check in was a separate line and we didn’t wait long.

The check in process was quick and easy and the Cast Member was friendly and helpful.

Our room was in the wing to the left as you enter the hotel from the car park side, it was a couple of minutes walk.

Room was a good size, two double beds, small window I think because we were on a corner, large chest of drawers with 3 deep and wide drawers, massive TV which allowed you to log in to Disney+ if you subscribe. A dressing unit with a big mirror, charging points and a coffee maker and kettle.

There was hanging space, safe and iron with ironing board opposite the sink where there was a decent hairdryer attached to the wall.

There is a curtain that you can pull across.

Through a separate lockable door is the toilet and a bath with a shower attachment. Next to the bath is a handy bench.

The beds were comfy and each bed had 4 pillows 

The room was nicely decorated and I liked the design and details.

There were two glass bottles of water, 6 coffee pods, 3 or 4 tea bags, 4 milks, sugars and sweeteners. We had 4 glasses and only small disposable coffee cups (I ended up buying a mug for a cup of tea!).

In the bathroom was a refillable shower gel on the wall with small individual shampoo and conditioner, there was soap near the sink.

Despite staying for 3 nights the housekeeping only emptied the bins and made the beds.

We didn’t get any replacements for the drinks and toiletries. I had brought some coffee and tea bags but it would have been nice to get some more milks.

There wasn’t a fridge or cooler.

I did notice that the room was clean but not spotless, there were bits on the carpet, dust on some surfaces and in general it appeared worn in some areas.

We went to the pool one afternoon and spent about 30 minutes there, it’s fairly large, not too cold, there were floats and balls and stuff. Changing rooms are nice, you are given towels at the reception, everyone uses the same changing rooms which have two doors (one from reception, the other to the pool), there are showers poolside, reception side has hairdryers which are attached to the wall and you adjust the height (they’re almost like hand dryers), there was a dryer for swimwear but it didn’t seem to work.

I have now stayed at all the hotels except the Disneyland Hotel. However the last stay was 10 years ago (Hotel Cheyenne).

I think that if I visit DLRP again with my son I would choose the Marvel Hotel for the vicinity (it was nice staying so close). Were I to do a solo trip (which I might to check out the new areas of Adventure World!!) I would probably stay at the Santa Fe (the first hotel I stayed at 25+ years ago!) as it’s the cheapest and I don’t mind the walk.

I think NBC is a one and done and unfortunately it’s not a patch on the Beach Club or Boardwalk at WDW.",6,1771527433.0,disneylandparis,6,1.0,False

I used the following gear:

sennheiser HD599\[CURRENLY USE AT HOME\] - nice open backs, good for home use, don't like the original curve so i put it to the ortary1990 curve which i enjoy the most. Very good. Only good for home use. My favorite headphone of all time so far with EQ.

Overall 10/10 for sound but 10/10 for fit and purpose

Samsung galaxy buds 2 pro - great TWS headphones, sounded great, very enjoyable -- irrated my ears too much so i had to stop using it. Good NC and ambient mode. Updates to the headphones ruined too much for me and i could never get the original soundcurve that these were shipped with. I would say this is one point below HD599 due to fit issues.

Overall 8.5/10 for sound but 6.5/10 for fit and purpose

Linsoul 7Hz x Crinacle Zero:1 - Great sounding iems, very quiet though, and irrated my ears. Good isolation but ears were always sore after wearing. Didn't like how i could hear myself swallow and chew in them though. Not good for travelling and public transit as to much noise would not be isolated. Overall 7/10 for sound but 4/10 for fit and purpose

Overall 7.5/10 for sound but 6/10 for fit and purpose

  
Moondrop Chu 1 Earbuds - eartips were great feeling, but also hurt my ears, however hurt too much in my ears and didn't have a good sound. Even tried to EQ it but wasn't great. Didn't like how i could hear myself swallow and chew in them though

Overall 4/10 for sound but 1/10 for fit and purpose

etymotics er20xs earplugs - great for concerts, reduced noise down and made everything stay hi-fi -- hurt my ear after too long was sore.

Overall 10/10 for sound but 4/10 for fit and purpose

Soundcore Space One\[daily driver\] - Decent sound, noise cancellation not that great, but fesable. Not good at blocking out voices, but can block out some transit noises. No complaints on sound quality but do wish that i could wear it in the winter as well over my winter gear. Can't wear for too long though and hurts when i have it around shoulder.

Overall 7.5/10 for sound but 5.5/10 for fit and purpose

  
E310 True Wireless Stereo Earbuds - fit was horriendus, cannot rate it as it was painful to wear. Used maybe once but not too bad imho

Overall 2/10 for sound but 1/10 for fit and purpose

  
Bluehive Bluebass Elite Wireless ANC Headphones - sound quality not bad, fit was horriendus, hurt my ears too much so i couldn't use it anyway.

Overall 5/10 for sound but 1/10 for fit and purpose  


If there is any recommendations, I would like to minimize my out of pocket spending, I had spoke with them and they said that only one piece of gear is allowed even though multiple may be of the same amount.



I have also even tried eartips like the spinfit for my samsung galaxy buds 2 pro but it seem to not work.

# The Peculiar Gravity of Mabel Chen

Mabel Chen learned early that the world had decided who she was before she'd ever gotten a chance to speak.

At twenty-three, she stood three feet eleven inches in her favorite boots—the ones with the subtle platform she pretended didn't exist. Her head was disproportionately large, round as a harvest moon, and her eyes dominated her face like something from an old anime her college roommate used to watch. They were dark and luminous, fringed with lashes so long they cast shadows on her cheeks. Her nose was small and upturned, the kind that might be called ""button"" in a children's book.

""You're like a living Precious Moments figurine,"" her sister had once said, not unkindly, but Mabel had heard the bewilderment underneath.

The problem wasn't that she was unattractive. Her features, taken individually, were delicate and symmetrical. Her skin was clear, her lips well-shaped. But the total effect—the enormous eyes in the oversized head atop the tiny body—created something the world didn't quite know how to process. Too cute to ignore, too unusual to forget, too childlike to take seriously.

She'd stopped going to bars in college after the third time someone asked her which parent she was waiting for. She'd given up on dating apps after matches would ghost her the moment they met in person, their faces doing that thing—that microscopic flinch of confusion and adjustment, like they were recalibrating what species she belonged to.

The coffee shop interview was going poorly.

""And you have experience with... customer service?"" The manager, a woman named Diane with severely plucked eyebrows, couldn't seem to decide where to look. Her gaze kept sliding away from Mabel's face, then snapping back, then away again.

""Three years as a receptionist at Hadley Medical,"" Mabel said, keeping her voice level and professional. She'd learned to pitch it slightly lower than natural. Higher voices made things worse.

""Right, right."" Diane glanced at the resume, though clearly not reading it. ""It's just... this is a very fast-paced environment. Lots of customer interaction. It can get quite intense.""

""I understand.""

""And we need someone who can project authority when necessary. Handle difficult situations.""

There it was. The polite version of *you look like a toddler in business casual*.

Mabel stood, carefully sliding her portfolio back into her bag. ""Thank you for your time.""

""Wait, I didn't mean—""

But Mabel was already out the door, her small legs carrying her quickly down the sidewalk. She'd gotten good at fast exits.

The only place she'd ever felt close to normal was online.

At night, after the succession of rejections and stares and condescending kindnesses that made up her days, Mabel retreated to her forum. It was ostensibly for people with unusual medical conditions, but it had evolved into something more—a refuge for those whose bodies didn't conform, who existed in the uncanny valley between acceptable and aberrant.

She typed under the username *cosmiceyes*, and nobody there knew what she looked like beyond her description. They knew her thoughts instead. Her sharp observations about old movies, her theories about quantum mechanics (her actual degree was in physics, not that anyone who met her believed it), her terrible puns.

""You're not weird,"" her friend RidgeRunner had told her once, during a late-night chat. ""The world's just got a very narrow window of normal, and they get uncomfortable when you remind them how arbitrary it is.""

That had helped, some.

The breakthrough came accidentally.

Mabel had started making YouTube videos explaining physics concepts, never showing her face—just her hands sketching diagrams, her voice narrating. They got a modest following. Then one day, during a live stream about black holes, someone hacked the camera on.

She panicked, froze, saw herself in the monitor—all enormous eyes and round face and tiny shoulders.

The chat exploded.

But not with the mockery she expected. Instead:

*OMG you're SO CUTE!* *Those EYES! 😍* *You look like a fairy tale character!* *She looks like if Pixar made a scientist and I'm HERE for it*

And beneath those, something else:

*This explanation is actually really good* *Finally someone who can explain Hawking radiation clearly* *Subscribed for the physics, staying for the whole vibe*

Within a week, she had fifty thousand followers. Within a month, two hundred thousand. The comments were a strange mix—people who came for the aesthetic stayed for the content, or came for the content and were charmed by the aesthetic. Yes, some were fetishistic and went into her block folder immediately. Yes, some were cruel. But something else was happening too.

She was becoming herself, publicly, and the sky wasn't falling.

A producer from PBS reached out. Then *Scientific American*. Then TED.

The first time she walked onto a stage, she felt the familiar ripple in the audience—that collective recalibration. But she'd learned something new: she could control the moment after. She walked to the podium without apology, looked out at them with her impossibly large eyes, and smiled.

""I know what you're thinking,"" she said. ""Yes, my head really is this big. I like to think of it as extra storage space for physics knowledge.""

The laughter was surprised, then genuine.

And then she taught them about the fundamental forces of the universe, and for forty-five minutes, she was just the person who knew things they wanted to learn.

It didn't fix everything. There were still strangers who talked to her like she was six. Still job applications that went nowhere. Still lonely Friday nights and the particular ache of being perceived as a curiosity rather than a person.

But she'd found something: a way to exist that acknowledged the strangeness while insisting on the substance. She was unusual, yes. Perhaps even a little freakish. But she was also brilliant, funny, and increasingly unwilling to shrink herself to fit other people's comfort.

The world would adjust, or it wouldn't.

Either way, Mabel Chen had work to do.",1,1771527064.0,GenAIWriters,2,1.0,False

She was mean in a fun way, loud, and hot (curly brown hair, curvy body, thick in all the right places), we talked a lot but I never made a move.

One day a junior from the year ahead of us just started hanging around her. Apparently he wanted to ask her to set him up with someone else but they ended up getting close instead.

They never dated, but there was something there, they always hung out. He brought her an iced coffee from off campus during a free period, and I caught him feeding her candy in the hallway one day and Not gonna lie, seeing him hand feed her candy felt like a point of no return but i kept orbiting her.

He graduated ahead of us, and I thought I might be able to make a move, but then the pandemic happened and I couldnt see her. A year of zoom classes made it hard to get closer to her, but she made a discord server so people could keep in touch.

And he was on it, and the way they talked on the server it seemed like they still communicated even after he graduated. They had inside jokes and hed be online a lot whenever she was in VC. I couldnt get her alone and I didnt want to dm her.

One day she posts about making an onlyfans, and I followed it from day one, always tipping and I even followed the socials she made for her onlyfans account, thats how into her I was. She always posted solo stuff and I thought she was single so Id keep fantasizing about being with her.

Then one day she made a post doing handstuff with a guy, and I thought it was the hottest thing until I found out who it was.

She publicly admitted on our discord that it was him. I wanted to pretend maybe he pushed her or something, but she confessed that she was the one who suggested it. That was their first time seeing each other in years and she just asked him to do that.

She chose this guy, even after knowing me for longer.

THis fucking guy got to have her and I just had to sit there and take it. I felt like a cuck.

After that I tried to unsub from her page and unfollow all her socials but i keep going back to her posts. Even the handstuff she did with him his face wasnt visible so I just pretended it was me.

I hate him so much. Why does he get to have her and I dont. Theyre not even dating.",1,1771527001.0,u_x_bananabus_x,0,1.0,False
1r97oyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1r97oyp/my_way_of_giving_back_to_the_community/,My way of giving back to the Community.,"So I have a lot of items that I gather up over time that I don't use or can't burn through quick enough to run out. I;e: Nuka Quantum, Canned Coffee, Nuka Twist, etc. And I drop them around the fasnacht event for low levels. But what irritates me is when greedy high levels will come over and try to take the items from someone thats level 30. It's so annoying. Sometimes I'll get messages saying ""can I get something?"" And they're account has 1000+ hours. It's annoying. Not to mention that sometimes they'll attack me and initiate pvp only to be insta killed by my EPF then they'll message me and whine and complain about how I took their junk. It's not my problem you shot me. Dont be so greedy.

1r97mvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1r97mvr/a_family_member_reached_a_terminal_diagnosis_and/,A family member reached a terminal diagnosis and I don't know how to feel.,"Today, roughly an hour ago I got news that a family member's cancer was no longer responding to treatment the way its supposed to, and that there isn't much left to do. All I feel is this knot on my throat and a feeling of just wanting to get back to my day. Drink my coffee, watch some youtube, laugh with some friends. And I feel like a monster for it. My rationale is that there is still time left. I don't know how much yet, but last time I saw her she looked as full of energy as usual. I told my mom that when this person comes to visit, all we can do is support her in every way we can, but my words felt hollow. Like I was saying some cliché everyone says when facing something like this. Another thing is her kids, they still don't know the extent of the situation. They aren't stupid, they know their mother is sick, and they're teenagers. My personal nightmare is losing my parents, and I can't begin to imagine the anguish they're about to go through.

Is this what denial feels like? For so long I've seen her come to our house with her kids, talk with my mom and I would gently excuse myself back to my room to do my own stuff. I just didn't want to deal with the chaos and how loud they can get. But now I just feel like this asshole, this massive cunt who can't endure 30 minutes of two kids goofing around and their hyperactive dog. My mom and her would regularly go and take coffee together and I just kept thinking ""Maybe one day I'll join in. Not today, I'd rather stay home doing my own thing.""

Now I really don't know what to do, or how to feel. The worst part that really makes me feel like I'm some sort of psycho is this feeling of annoyance. ""I don't want to deal with this"" is what I keep thinking. I just wished none of this was happening, but it is. It really is.

Anyways, sorry if this came across as a disorganized rant but this is what I'm feeling at the moment. Maybe I'll delete this later, or maybe I won't.

1r97j6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r97j6w/how_to_become_10x_more_attractive_without/,How to Become 10x More Attractive Without Changing Your Looks: The Playbook That Actually Works,"Here's something nobody wants to admit: we've all been sold a lie. We think attraction is about having the perfect face, perfect body, or perfect wardrobe. But after diving deep into psychology research, reading books by behavioral scientists, and studying what actually makes people magnetic, I realized we've been focusing on the wrong shit.



The truth? Real attraction has almost nothing to do with your physical appearance. Studies from evolutionary psychology show that charisma, confidence, and how you make people feel around you are what creates lasting magnetism. Your face might get someone's attention for 5 seconds, but your energy, presence, and emotional intelligence are what make them want to stay. This isn't some feel good BS. This is backed by decades of research on human behavior and social dynamics.



I spent months going through books, podcasts, and YouTube channels from actual experts, not random self help gurus. And the patterns were clear: the most attractive people aren't the prettiest. They're the ones who've mastered internal game.



\## Step 1: Master the art of presence (stop being a ghost)



Most people are physically present but mentally checked out. They're scrolling, overthinking, or waiting for their turn to talk. That's why when someone gives you genuine attention, it feels like a drug. You want more.



\*\*The Charisma Myth\*\* by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly. Cabane coached executives at Stanford and worked with leaders at Google, and this book is basically the manual for becoming magnetic without changing a single thing about your appearance. She explains that charisma isn't some mystical gift, it's a skill built on three pillars: presence, power, and warmth.



The presence part hit me hard. She talks about how most of us are trapped in our own heads during conversations, planning what to say next instead of actually listening. Real presence means shutting that internal dialogue off and being fully locked into the moment. When you do this, people feel it. They feel seen. And that's insanely attractive.



The book gives you practical exercises, like focusing on the sensations in your toes during conversations to ground yourself in the present moment. Sounds weird, but it works. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social influence. Seriously, best charisma book I've ever read.



\## Step 2: develop emotional intelligence (stop being emotionally illiterate)



You can't be attractive if you can't read a room or understand what people are actually feeling beneath their words. Emotional intelligence is like having X ray vision for human behavior.



\*\*Emotional Intelligence 2.0\*\* by Travis Bradberry is the gold standard here. Bradberry is a psychologist who's worked with Fortune 500 companies, and this book comes with an actual assessment test that shows you exactly where you're lacking. The book breaks down EQ into four skills: self awareness, self management, social awareness, and relationship management.



Here's the kicker: people with high EQ are wildly more successful in relationships, careers, and life in general. The book taught me that most conflicts happen because people can't regulate their own emotions or read others' emotional states. Once you level up your EQ, you become the person everyone wants to be around because you just get people.



The strategies are super practical too. Things like labeling your emotions as they happen, pausing before reacting, and learning to pick up on microexpressions. You'll start noticing patterns in how people communicate, and you'll be able to navigate social situations like a pro. Insanely good read if you want to become emotionally magnetic.



For those wanting to go deeper on charisma and social intelligence but not sure where to start with all these books, there's BeFreed, an AI learning app built by former Google engineers. Type in something like 'I want to become more charismatic as someone who's naturally introverted' and it pulls from books like The Charisma Myth, research on social psychology, and expert interviews to create a personalized audio learning plan. You can switch between a 10 minute summary or a 40 minute deep dive depending on your energy level, and the voice options are actually addictive, like the smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology feel like a friend explaining things over coffee.



The adaptive learning plan is what makes it different. It evolves based on what resonates with you and where you're struggling. Makes it way easier to stay consistent without feeling like homework.



\## Step 3: build unshakeable confidence (fake it till you become it)



Confidence isn't about being the loudest person in the room. It's about being comfortable in your own skin, even when shit gets uncomfortable. And yeah, you can build it from scratch.



\*\*The Confidence Code\*\* by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman dives into the neuroscience and psychology behind confidence. These journalists interviewed neuroscientists, psychologists, and elite athletes to figure out what actually builds confidence. Spoiler: it's not positive affirmations or vision boards.



Real confidence comes from action. The book talks about how your brain physically changes when you push through fear and discomfort. Every time you do something that scares you, even small stuff, your brain rewires itself to be less afraid next time. They call it ""failing fast"" because the more you put yourself in uncomfortable situations, the faster you build resilience.



One section that stuck with me was about body language. Studies show that holding power poses for two minutes actually changes your hormone levels, increasing testosterone and decreasing cortisol. Your body literally tricks your brain into feeling more confident. This book is packed with research but written in a way that doesn't feel like a textbook. If you struggle with self doubt, this will rewire how you think about confidence.



\## Step 4: communicate like you actually care (words are weapons or gifts)



Most people suck at communication. They either talk too much about themselves or don't say anything meaningful at all. Learning to communicate in a way that makes people feel valued is a cheat code for attraction.



\*\*Nonviolent Communication\*\* by Marshall Rosenberg is a game changer. Rosenberg was a psychologist who developed this framework for resolving conflicts and connecting with people on a deeper level. The core idea is simple: most communication fails because we focus on judgments and criticisms instead of needs and feelings.



The book teaches you how to express yourself without blaming others and how to listen in a way that makes people feel truly heard. It's broken into four steps: observe without evaluating, identify feelings, connect feelings to needs, and make clear requests. Sounds basic, but it's powerful.



I started using this in everyday conversations, and people responded differently. They opened up more. They trusted me faster. Because I wasn't trying to win arguments or prove I was right, I was actually trying to understand them. If you want to become someone people feel safe around, read this book. It'll change how you relate to everyone in your life.



\## Step 5: cultivate curiosity (be interesting by being interested)



Attractive people aren't just attractive because they're hot. They're attractive because they make others feel interesting. And the only way to do that is to be genuinely curious about people.



Use an app like \*\*Finch\*\* to build the habit of self reflection and curiosity. It's a self care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it's actually built on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. Every day, it prompts you with questions that help you reflect on your emotions, goals, and behaviors. Over time, this builds self awareness, which makes you better at understanding others.



When you're curious about yourself, you become curious about other people. You start asking better questions. You stop waiting for your turn to talk and actually engage with what someone is saying. Curiosity is magnetic because it makes people feel seen and valued, and that's rare as hell these days.



\## Step 6: own your story (vulnerability is strength, not weakness)



People are drawn to authenticity. Not the fake ""I'm being real"" Instagram post kind, but actual vulnerability. When you can own your struggles, your failures, and your weird quirks without shame, you become magnetic.



\*\*Daring Greatly\*\* by Brené Brown is essential here. Brown is a research professor who spent years studying vulnerability, shame, and courage. This book destroys the myth that vulnerability is weakness. She shows, through actual data, that vulnerability is the birthplace of connection, creativity, and belonging.



The book taught me that trying to appear perfect or hiding your flaws actually pushes people away. It creates distance. But when you're willing to show up as your real, imperfect self, people connect with you on a human level. Brown gives you the tools to stop armor up and start showing up authentically. If you've ever felt like you had to wear a mask around people, this book will set you free.



Real attraction isn't about looks. It's about presence, emotional intelligence, confidence, communication, curiosity, and authenticity. Master these, and you'll become 10x more magnetic without changing a damn thing about your appearance.",1,1771526611.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

The date was January 31, 1989. The snow piled up on the corners of streets as snowplows drove past intersections and underpasses. You stood in the blistering cold, your bleeding knuckles singing strangled cries through your nerves. ***BEEP, BEEP, BEEP!*** Your alarm clock blares as you wake in a cold sweat, your heart beating faster than the bullet train railing past your window. You look at your knuckles. They were clean, no abrasions, cracks, cuts, or scrapes. 

You stand slowly, your headache subsiding, barely. You check your watch. *Late…again.* You look in the mirror, and there you are: Mara Sentson. You stumble over your cat, Mr. Mittens, as you head to your closet for clothes. He responds with a scratch and a hiss. He isn’t truly mad at you, just startled…and hungry. Your stomach starts to growl as well. “Ready for breakfast, Mit?” you ask in a tired tone. After getting into your business casual, you head over to the pantry. “What’s on the menu today…” you asked yourself. You half hoped Mr. Mittens would respond, but since reality isn’t in your favor, he just meows. “Close enough.” The pantry was scarce, with a box half-full of cereal, and three cans of cat tuna. You opened a can, slicing your finger on the metal. *Sigh, another thing to add to the day…*“I’ll be back, Mit, just grabbing a band-aid.” You reach into the medicine cabinet with your other hand, grabbing the old, worn-out box of band-aids.

The sting of the cleaner wakes you up slightly, though you would still prefer a coffee. You cover the wound with the bandage, then you fill Mr. Mitten’s cat bowl. “Bon appétit, Monsieur Mit.” You pour your cereal and go to grab milk. *Expired…dry cereal it is then.* You sit and eat, biting your tongue on the last bite. *Damn it…just one more to my injury bingo. Just one more and I win!* You laugh to yourself. You clean up, grabbing your keys, train card, and jacket. “Don’t wreck the place while I'm gone, Mr. Mittens, I’ll be back in a few hours.” As you leave the house, you see the notice on your door. It’s not an eviction notice, Mrs. Oryl isn't a mean person. But it is letting you know rent is due in the next few weeks and she isn’t able to cover due to her husband's funeral costs. It’s also an invitation to join her for tea on the third of next month. ",1,1771526502.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

My sister is moving in with her partner in June, so a space is opening up in the sweet, cat-friendly 2bed 2bath she and I share! The house is located a few blocks from Tower Grove Park, with in-unit washer and dryer, updated kitchen appliances, a fenced in back yard, space to garden, a large basement (used for storage but the folks before us used it for an art and workout space so you could do whatever with it), and a pretty chill and responsive social worker landlord. 



🏡The room itself is carpeted, with a full private bathroom, private entrance and your own small porch, private entry into the basement, and an off street parking space. You are welcome to start moving belongings into the basement or shared spaces starting in early/mid-June after you've signed the lease🏡

I’m posting this because I finally had a ""come to Jesus"" moment with my workspace today. For months, I’ve been struggling with shaky flourishes and inconsistent ink flow, and I kept blaming my nibs, my paper, or my ""off days."" Then today, I accidentally knocked a bottle of walnut ink onto a set of envelopes I’d nearly finished, all because I was trying to work around a pile of unopened mail and three half-empty coffee mugs.



I realized I wasn't being a ""free-spirited artist."" I was just being a disaster.



The truth is, I’ve always been a bit of a slob at the bench. I thought ""true creatives"" worked in a whirlwind of scattered pens and ink splatters. But looking back at my worst projects, they all happened when I was literally cramped into a 6-inch square of space because the rest of my desk was covered in junk.



I’ve spent the last four hours stripping my desk down to the bare wood. I scrubbed off the dried ink crusts and finally organized my nibs by flex. It felt tedious, and honestly, I felt like I was wasting time I should have been spending practicing.



But then I sat down to do a simple drill. For the first time in weeks, my arm felt free. No hitting a stray stapler mid-stroke. No weird shadows from a poorly placed lamp.



I was looking at some of the professional engraving and lettering work on [bespokenj.in](http://bespokenj.in) earlier, and it hit me—you can actually see the physical space in the work. There’s a certain level of precision that you just can’t hit if you’re fighting your environment. The ""grit"" of this craft isn't just about the hours spent on the pen; it’s about the boring stuff, like keeping your light source consistent and your surface flat.



It’s not about having a ""pretty"" Instagram-worthy studio. It’s just about respect for the tools. When my nib is clean and my desk is clear, I’m not thinking about the mess; I’m actually just thinking about the letterforms.



I’m curious—do you guys have a ""ritual"" for resetting your space, or do you just power through the clutter until something breaks (or spills)? Am I the only one who didn't realize how much the physical mess was affecting my mental focus?",1,1771526353.0,bespokenji,1,1.0,False

You know those moments where you stare at code for hours, days even, and it just *doesn't make sense*? Yeah, I've been living that hell for the past week. We're talking a legacy system, built by ancient wizards who apparently coded in hieroglyphs, and a bug that only popped up under very specific, almost mystical conditions.

The task was simple on paper: a minor update to a reporting module. But as soon as I deployed it, reports started sporadically failing. Not all of them, just, like, 1 in 20. And the error? A generic `NullReferenceException` in a part of the code that hadn't been touched in years. My stomach just sank. I spent what felt like an eternity stepping through debugger lines, feeling the cold dread creep up my spine as everything looked perfectly fine, *every single time*.

I tried everything – logging, unit tests, prayer. My desk was a graveyard of empty coffee cups, and my eyes felt like sandpaper. The frustration was a physical weight, pressing down on me. I started questioning my sanity, convinced the bug was mocking me. The breakthrough finally came at 2 AM, fueled by cold pizza and pure stubbornness. I was tracing a data flow, completely by hand, on a whiteboard that looked like a crime scene, when a tiny, almost invisible detail jumped out.

It turned out, deep within a forgotten corner of the database, a `varchar` field was sometimes, *just sometimes*, storing an empty string instead of an actual `NULL` value. And the ancient code, bless its heart, was explicitly checking for `NULL`, but not for `''`. So, when that empty string came along, it happily passed the `NULL` check, only to explode spectacularly later when a function tried to operate on it as if it were valid data. The relief that washed over me was immense, like shedding a heavy, invisible cloak.

Fixing it was literally a one-line change: `if (value == null || value == """")`. One line, after days of agonizing, soul-crushing debugging. The sheer absurdity of it made me laugh, a slightly unhinged, exhausted laugh. My fingers were hovering over the keyboard, ready to commit that glorious, tiny fix.

Has anyone else ever spent an insane amount of time tracking down a bug that turned out to be something ridiculously simple? What was your most infuriating 'A-HA!' moment?",1,1771526342.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I’m 21M, studying computer engineering. I’m pretty serious about my goals — I don’t just want to work a 9–5 forever. I want to build something of my own in tech one day. Something real. That drive is a big part of who I am.

Outside of school, I’m really into staying active. I play different sports, train regularly, and I’m currently trying to bulk up and get stronger. I’ve been focusing a lot on self-growth lately — mentally and physically. Just trying to level up in every way.

When I’m not studying or working out, I’m probably reading (I’m really into history — I like understanding how everything became the way it is). I also love long conversations. The random ones that somehow turn deep. The 1 a.m. talks about life, the future, dumb theories, all of it.

I’ve been in a serious relationship before. I took time to focus on myself after that, and now I’m at a point where I actually want something real. I’m not looking to talk to a bunch of people or play games. I want one person. My person. Someone I can stick with and build something meaningful with long-term. A best friend and a partner.

Ideally you’re around my age, emotionally mature, kind, and also looking for something genuine — not rushed, just intentional.

We can start by talking, see if we click. If we’re both comfortable, maybe swap pictures and grab coffee or check out a cool spot in the city. Keep it simple.

If you made it this far, tell me:

2. I ride a motorcycle because sidewalks are for people with no sense of adventure.🏍🔥

3. Fun isn’t something I plan, it just kind of happens when I’m around. Late-night laughs, spontaneous plans, and moments you’ll remember way too clearly.

4. Coffee is not a lifestyle, it's my bloodtype.☕️❤️

5. And when there’s energy left over, you’ll find me at the gym lifting, pushing limits, or just clearing my head.

(Four facts? Five? Who’s counting when the vibe’s this good.)😏😌

As for the pineapple debate:

It’s sweet, a little controversial, and completely underrated. Kind of like me, honestly. Plus, if fruit on pizza makes it a salad, I’m basically a wellness icon.🤣👀

It wasn’t fireworks.

It was quieter than that.

It was a Thursday afternoon and the bookstore smelled like dust, paper, and coffee grounds that had been reheated too many times. I was pretending to read a novel I’d already finished twice, mostly because I didn’t want to go home yet.

That’s when she walked in.

She wasn’t loud. She didn’t turn heads. But she carried this calm, like someone who had finally stopped running from something.

She wore a soft gray sweater that looked like it had been washed a hundred times. Comfortable. Familiar. The kind of sweater you borrow and never return.

I noticed her because she paused at the entrance. Not checking her phone. Not scanning for someone.

Just… breathing.

Like she needed the quiet.

I went back to pretending to read, but I was watching her through the shelf gap between memoirs and poetry.

She went straight to the LGBTQ+ section.

My heart did that small, embarrassing jump.

Not because she was there. But because she didn’t hesitate.

She picked up a book. Flipped through it. Smiled slightly the kind of smile you don’t give to people. The kind you give to yourself.

I don’t know what possessed me. I’m not bold. I rehearse coffee orders in my head.

But I walked over.

“Is that one good?” I asked, nodding toward the book she was holding.

She looked up.

Her eyes were warm. Not sharp. Not assessing. Just… open.

“I don’t know yet,” she said. “But it feels like it might hurt in a good way.”

That made me laugh. And she smiled like she’d hoped it would.

“I’ve read it,” I said. “It does.”

We stood there for a second too long.

And something shifted.

It wasn’t lust. It wasn’t fantasy.

It was recognition.

Like we both knew what it meant to search for ourselves in pages because no one ever handed us a manual.

She introduced herself first.

“I’m Elena.”

The way she said it, soft but steady, made me want to say her name back just to see how it felt in my mouth.

“I’m Mara.”

We shook hands.

Who shakes hands?

But neither of us pulled away quickly.

Her hands were warm. Mine were probably shaking.

“Do you come here often?” she asked, and immediately made a face. “Wow. That sounded like a terrible line.”

I grinned. “Only when I’m emotionally avoiding my responsibilities.”

She laughed full this time. Head slightly back. Guard down.

And there it was.

That tiny, invisible thread.

We ended up sitting in the small café corner of the bookstore. Talking about books at first. Then about where we grew up. Then about the first time we realized we liked girls and how terrifying and beautiful that was.

She told me she used to pray it would go away.

I told her I used to pretend it wasn’t there.

We didn’t say it out loud, but we both understood the weight of that.

At one point she reached across the table to emphasize a story and her fingers brushed mine.

Neither of us moved.

It was the softest touch.

But it felt like a question.

And an answer.

When the bookstore announced they were closing, it surprised us. We’d been there three hours.

Outside, the air was cold. The sky turning that deep navy that feels intimate somehow.

She hesitated before leaving.

“I’m really glad I walked in today,” she said.

I swallowed.

“Me too.”

There’s a specific kind of courage it takes to ask another woman for her number when you’re not sure if the spark is mutual when you’ve been wrong before, when you’ve read signs that weren’t there.

But I did it anyway.

“Would you maybe want to… get coffee again? On purpose this time?”

She didn’t hesitate.

“I’d like that.”

When she typed her number into my phone, she saved it with a heart next to her name.

Just one.

Small.

Intentional.

That night, I lay in bed replaying everything. The way she smiled. The way she listened. The way her voice softened when she talked about her first crush.

It wasn’t fireworks.

It was something steadier.

Something that didn’t feel like chaos or chasing.

It felt like coming home to a place I hadn’t known I’d been missing.

And sometimes, the way you meet someone tells you everything.

Not because it’s dramatic.

But because it’s gentle.

And you realize love doesn’t always crash into your life.

Sometimes it walks quietly into a bookstore…

I’m a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!",1,1771525880.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1r972em,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overemployed_PH/comments/1r972em/i_work_night_shift_icu/,I work night shift. ICU.,"A few months ago we admitted a 58-year-old male. Cardiac complications. Uncontrolled hypertension. Renal decline. Newly diagnosed aggressive cancer found during the workup.

When I walked into his room, he wasn’t panicked.

He was tired.

Not sleepy.

Tired in his bones.

As I started my assessment, he looked at me and said,

“You’re a nurse, right?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Promise me something.”

I paused. “Depends what it is.”

“Promise me you won’t live like I did.”

That caught me off guard.

⸻

Over the next few nights, I learned his story.

He worked two jobs for 30 years. Slept four hours a night. Lived on coffee and drive-through meals. Missed physicals. Ignored headaches. Brushed off chest tightness.

“I thought stress was just part of being responsible,” he said.

He showed me pictures on his phone.

A small house.

“That mortgage cost me sleep for 20 years.”

A warehouse floor.

“Worked doubles. No days off for months.”

A hospital bracelet from ten years ago.

“Doctor told me my blood pressure was dangerous. I said I’d handle it.”

He never did.

“I kept saying I’ll rest when things calm down,” he told me. “Things never calm down.”

⸻

One night around 2 AM, monitors steady, unit quiet, he looked at me and said:

“You know what the worst part is?”

“What?”

“I didn’t even enjoy the years I was sacrificing myself. I was too stressed to feel them.”

Silence.

“I missed birthdays because I was exhausted. Snapped at my wife because I was depleted. Stopped going to the gym because I was ‘too busy.’”

He laughed softly.

“Turns out my body was keeping score.”

Hypertension.

Chronic inflammation.

Untreated sleep deprivation.

Cortisol through the roof for decades.

Then cancer.

“I thought disease just happens,” he said. “No one told me stress is slow poison.”

As nurses, we know better.

But we don’t live better.

⸻

One shift he grabbed my wrist gently.

“You look tired.”

I almost laughed.

“Occupational hazard.”

He shook his head. “No. That’s how it starts. You normalize it.”

He pointed to his chest.

“This doesn’t break overnight. It erodes.”

He told me he used to brag about never calling out.

Never taking vacation.

Never needing help.

“Turns out my body didn’t care about my work ethic.”

⸻

He declined quickly.

Organ systems that had been compensating for years just… stopped compensating.

On his last night, he said something I’ll never forget.

“Tell nurses this: Rest is not weakness. It’s maintenance. Stress isn’t just emotional. It’s biological. And your body will collect the debt.”

He died at 4:12 AM.

No dramatic moment.

Just a tired body that had been running on empty for decades.

⸻

I went home after that shift and couldn’t sleep.

Not because of grief.

Because of recognition.

How many of us are living the same way?

Stacking shifts.

Ignoring headaches.

Normalizing 3 hours of sleep.

Pushing through burnout like it’s resilience.

We educate patients about hypertension.

About inflammation.

About stress management.

Then we chart for 14 hours and call it dedication.

⸻

Now I nurse differently.

But more importantly, I live differently.

I take my days off.

I monitor my labs.

I sleep.

I say no to extra shifts when my body says no.

Because I watched a man die from decades of “I’ll rest later.”

Stress is not just mental.

It is chemical.

Hormonal.

Cellular.

And your body keeps score.

Every time.

Be a great nurse.

But don’t sacrifice your organs to prove it.

Someone is in your bed right now because they thought exhaustion was strength.

Don’t let that be you.

Choose rest before rest chooses you

1r971ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1r971ep/being_ghosted_a_month_ago_and_still_cannot_find/,"Being ghosted a month ago, and still cannot find closure","**TL;DR:**  
I dated someone with strong initial chemistry who repeatedly pulled away after closeness. After a hopeful reconnection and a great meeting, she suddenly stopped responding altogether. I don’t know if this was ghosting or avoidant withdrawal, but the lack of communication and closure has affected me deeply, and I’m struggling to process it.

I met a girl online in October 2025. After a few weeks of chatting, we met IRL, and as there was mutual liking and chemistry, we started dating. It was intense at the beginning. We asked each other at some point, but neither of us wanted to slow down. We got intimate soon. Everything seemed to be fine.  
After the first time we were intimate, a few days later she became more distant and started to leave me on read for long hours or over a day. She kept delaying the next meeting, even though we are both local and live close. I felt something was off, so I asked her directly if I did something wrong.  
This finally got me an answer, and my gut feeling was right: she had something to say. I received a very honest and vulnerable message about her state and why we could not carry on. I accepted it and reassured her that I respected it, and that a slow pace was better for me as well. I was scared myself about how quickly things went, and in the end I didn’t mind a slow build. I felt a lot of respect for her because she opened up and was honest about it.  
We kept texting, but from that point I started to reframe this connection in my mind as a friendship. I valued the connection and her personality over romantic potential. December was a bit up and down. Sometimes she left me on read for a few days, or even a week. I did not push her or send multiple messages when I had no reply. It was not always easy for me, as I have earned secure attachment now after many years of therapy. But when communication has no clarity, I lean anxious.  
On Christmas Day, after a week of silence, I sent one message to tell her I understood the need for space and quiet, and to wish her the best. I also encouraged her in her journey. In my mind, I didn’t even know if I had already been ghosted, but I wanted to leave that message there without chasing or anything. She replied warmly and repaired the silence. We started chatting more frequently again.  
In January she asked if I wanted to meet, and we arranged it. It wasn’t stated that it was a date, and I didn’t take it as one to avoid disappointment or awkwardness. She turned up with beautiful flowers (we are both women). The meeting went great, and I was very optimistic. We both said we enjoyed it and wanted to meet again. After that, she used “next time” language a few times in our chats, so my romantic interest was awakened again.  
A few days later, the communication started to slow down again. By that time, I recognised a pattern of withdrawal after closeness. I thought she was scared and needed time to regulate, which felt understandable. I also started realising that I was doing this all alone. We never named the silences. I thought that next time I saw her, I would tell her that when she disappears without a sign, it makes me overthink. But I never got the opportunity.  
She had encouraged me to ask her out previously, so after 10 days from our meeting, I asked if she was willing to have a coffee again. I got an answer quickly, asking about my schedule (and she mentioned she didn’t have her diary with her, which I completely ignored as a red flag). I answered with my availability that same evening, and I haven’t heard a word since. Not a single line.  
After a few days, I sent a funny meme and a polite reminder asking if she was still up for the meeting, but that hasn’t been answered either, and it has now been four weeks. So I know I have been ghosted. She didn’t block me or unfriend me, which is strange. I didn’t do it either, because I couldn’t — I’m not sure why.

Two weeks later, I sent one final letter — not to restart contact, but to give myself closure. A handwritten letter, scanned as a photo, because I couldn’t find closure in silence. I didn’t accuse her of anything, chase, or beg, and I wished her well. She left it on read, or switched off read receipts.  
I have never been ghosted like this before, and I cannot get out of the spiral. I cannot find closure. I was hoping the letter would help, but now I just feel embarrassed about it. I don’t even understand what is happening to me. I feel erased and discarded. It doesn’t align with anything I believed about this person. I feel broken and shattered, and I am suffering from panic attacks. I don’t know if everything was just a lie. Nothing makes any sense. I could take a rejection, but I don’t know how to handle this. I’m not angry — I’m just confused and trying to process what happened.",2,1771525544.0,ghosting,1,1.0,False

I was thinking to myself why was he looking at me, and it made me feel weird. Like a good kind of weird. Hormones or whatever I guess. He eventually said that he liked my jacket and that it looked good, and I said thanks. I kind of wanted to cry. I can’t explain it in text but I am so socially awkward in real life I probably looked sped to this guy when I said thanks. I went in, got my coffee, and then I practically ran out of the store. I feel hopeless. I’m 17, never had any relationship, and I act like that after a single compliment. I wish I wasn’t as chudlike as I am but I can’t help it. I’ve always been like this.
