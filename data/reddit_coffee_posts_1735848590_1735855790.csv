1hs5s63,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs5s63,"Help! Desperate, Overwhelmed & ADHD! ANY TIPS/ADVICE/OPINIONS welcome & extremely appreciated!! ","Hello everyone I have never posted something like this but I am ^ desperate & overwhelmed and in need of second opinions & advice. 

PLEASE forgive me for the disaster that this room currently is. 

Moving in to boyfriend’s apartment. Trying to figure out the best way to make use of this rectangular & very dark living room space. 

With the dark wood, brown furniture & dark finishes thorough the apt it feels so dark and I have been desperately trying to come up with ideas on how to make better use of the space while brightening it up and adding color. 

All the furniture pictured has to stay. I wish we could get a small sectional but the couch is his grandparents and he refuses to put it in storage so that is out of the question for now. 

He is on board with finding other pieces for the room. We know we want one or two bookshelves / something similar to display my book collection, our plants, etc. I would also love to find a way to add more seating without making the room feel cluttered. 

Unfortunately the big ass deep freezer has to stay. I attempted to cover it with green peel and stick but gave up halfway through (it’s the adhd lol) and I’ve racked my brain trying to think of ways to make it have dual purposes. I thought about painting it and adding wood or glass of some sort to the top, finding two barstools / seats and making it into a little eating space. I tried finding a cabinet big enough to hide it with no luck. I also considered getting a different cabinet to go on top to at least have more vertical space for storage but again, haven’t had any luck. If anyone has suggestions for this I would be ETERNALLY grateful. 

We also are planning to find two smaller ottomans to keep under the coffee table to add color as well as more room for us and our dog on this tiny couch. 

I have a rug that is in the photos and am planning on adding throw pillows and blankets that coordinate and I do plan to add a floor plant somewhere. 

There is a picture of the little built in nook in the kitchen which I would love to make into a simple little bar cart type situation but again, don’t know where to start - once I try everything begins to feel cluttered! 

That’s about all - if you’re still reading this, please know how thankful I am for you lol. I cannot live in this chaos much longer and I am at a loss of ideas. 

Any ideas or advice welcome and MUCH appreciated 😀

But going off some tiktok equation I wanted to stay between 1755-1955 calories. At first I was a little higher than that range but struggled to eat all 3 meals a day, so I cut back on my portions. I really want to establish a better routine and relationship with food to set me up for success. Doing the math now, my deficit tends to be 1300-1500 calories. My friend said this is too low for me and will be unsustainable, but I feel like I'm eating better than when I was doing 1800ish calories, I can eat 3 meals and feel full, and still have coffee and a dessert. 

My calculation for this week was:

coffee at home ( cold brew + 35 g of creamer ) = 163 calories

breakfast
1 kodiak waffle
55 g cottage cheese
30 g strawberry compote ( made with little sugar )
8 g honey
2 slices of turkey bacon
Total = 285 calories

lunch
4-5 small red potatos air fried 
2 air fryed chicken tenderloins with sugar free bbq and honey
14 g colby jack cheese
7 g french fried onions
28 g cottage cheese ranch
Total = 340 calories

dinner
rigatoni noodles
2 air fryed chicken tenderloins with a small amount of italian panko
less than 1/2 cup of marinara
55 g blended cottage cheese
14 g mozzerella
a side of air fryed zucchini chips with parm
Total = 518 calories but I can never finish this meal. Either I dont make the zucchini or I dont finish the pasta.

dessert
1 greek yogurt
16.5 g peanut butger
14 g m&ms
Total = 290 calories

Plus I drink 1-2 big tumblers of water a day, sometimes one will be with a zero sugar flavoring sometimes not.

So this week came out to 1596 calories a day but less because I can't finish dinner. Next week my total came 1492.

1hs5ksr,https://www.reddit.com/r/thirdwavedecaf/comments/1hs5ksr/update_decaf_before_death_has_launched_lessons/,Update: Decaf Before Death Has Launched! Lessons From the Journey So Far,"Hi everyone,

A month ago, I shared my plans to launch [Decaf Before Death!](https://www.decafbeforedeath.co.uk), a UK-based subscription service focusing on exceptional decaf coffees. I’m thrilled to say the store is officially launched! 🎉

As promised, I wanted to not only share the update but also some of the fascinating things I’ve learnt during this journey:

1. Roasters are excited about decaf

When I started reaching out to roasters, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I was surprised (and thrilled) to see so many passionate about promoting high-quality decaf and making it more accessible. Some even asked me for recommendations on decafs they should explore!

2. Quality decaf is finally gaining ground

Seven years ago, “death before decaf” was the norm, but that mindset is fading. Today, more roasters are including top-tier decafs in their offerings, with profiles as exciting and complex as their regular coffees. For some roasters, decaf is one of their best selling coffees (e.g. Blendin)

3. Cost is a major challenge

One thing I’ve learnt is that quality decaf is expensive—often comparable to Geshas and other rare coffees. There’s no middle ground for affordable, interesting decaf options. Laurina (and other low-caf coffees) are also similarly rare and costly, partly due to limited availability and high shipping fees. This explains why decaf options in many subscriptions tend to fall short... I feel that my prices are quite high but my margin are very small.

4. International expansion is tricky

I’ve had requests to open Decaf Before Death to non-UK subscribers, but the costs and logistics are a nightmare. Freshness isn’t the main concern though — most top decafs need longer resting times anyway (some roasters recommend at least 30 days!)—but shipping fees and public perception about freshness are significant barriers.

What’s next?

Here’s how we’re starting:
☕ Special Launch Drops:

Rainbow Cocktail Decaf by September Coffee Roasters (on sale now).

Waiting for some coffees from Blendin (award winning Los Nogales) and a Laurina from A.M.O.C. I've never seen a coffee from Blendin in the UK so very excited about that!



📦 February Quarterly Discovery Box:

Pre-orders now open.

Features four curated decafs from top roasters (2 international and 2 UK).


💸 Launch Offer:
Use code EARLYBIRD for 20% off your first order as a thank-you for your support.

This community has played such a big part in my decaf journey, and I’m grateful for all the insights and encouragement you’ve shared. I’d love to hear your thoughts on these trends and any feedback you might have.


Thanks,

1hs5kkq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs5kkq,Unknown autoimmune disease 🦠 ,"So… I’ve been experiencing weird symptoms and I want to see if anyone else is having this issue. Mid July 2024 my nose would start running only when I was at the gym but I never paid it mind then beginning of August 2024 my fingers got very tingly, itchy and then my fingers swelled up. By mid August my fingers, mouth and face were swelling daily. My taste buds changed and I was getting hives in my head, on my elbows, knees and wrist. I couldn’t understand why. The hives or lesions in my head seemed to happen more often when I drank coffee or redbull. So I assumed I may have a new sensitivity to caffeine? My head would itch so bad that I was causing sores. I was also getting sharp shooting pains in my left wrist. I explained it to the MedMD dr and she said it was joint pain. My left knee was also bothering me severely. I thought it had been something I was eating and or doing something wrong at the gym so I went to an allergist. Turns out I have no allergies so I was sent for further testing and tested positive for ANA test. I was then referred to a rheumatologist. It’s been 2 months and they still cannot figure out what I have. They believe I have chronic hives. I’ve had hives before and I have never had them like this. Hives usually come in clusters for me and these are huge red blotches on my skin. I’ve been taking allergy medicine daily, if I don’t take it I begin to wheeze and have shortness of breath and then the swelling, muscle aches (my forearm) and joint pain begins. In December I got off all antihistamines for 5 days to take a blood test and that was my worse flare up. My right heel hurt for almost 2 weeks even after I started the antihistamines on a regular. I couldn’t even walk on it. I toss and turn all night. I’ve noticed that my symptoms are the worst when I’m sleeping. I wake up crying and in so much pain. It’s almost impossible to sleep even when on the antihistamine. I am fine throughout the entire day until bed time 😒. Is anyone else experiencing this? Any advice for what I can take to relieve the swelling, joint pain, muscles soreness and hives? ",1,1735854739.0,Skin_Rashes,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share some life-changing hacks I've picked up during my time in college. Hopefully, these help you survive and thrive too!

1. **Study Smarter, Not Harder:** Use apps like Notion or Anki for efficient note-taking and flashcards. Active recall - rereading notes!
2. **Free Coffee on Campus:** Many clubs host events with free food and drinks. Check your student portal or bulletin boards regularly.
3. **Discount EVERYTHING:** Always ask if there's a student discount - movie tickets, bus passes, gym memberships, you name it!
4. **Time Blocking for Success:** Schedule study blocks in your calendar, including breaks. It keeps you focused and sane.
5. **Save on Printing:** Most professors accept digital submissions. If not, check for free printing credits at the library or student union.
6. **Free Textbook PDFs:** Sites like Library Genesis or even a quick Google search for ""\[Book Name\] PDF"" can save you $$$.
7. **Meal Prep Like a Pro:** Cooking in bulk saves time and cash. Buy a rice cooker - it's a dorm room MVP.
8. **Avoid the Parking Fees:** Park in nearby residential areas and walk or bike. It's annoying but way cheaper.
9. **Professor Office Hours:** They're often underused but can boost your grade (and help you network). Proffessors notice effort!
10. **Be Friends with the Librarians:** They know all the free resources you didn't even know existed.

1hs5i5c,https://i.redd.it/qg952p3uinae1.jpeg,Honduras COE #5 Las Virginias Gesha Washed 90.04,"This coffee has a light body, typical of a Geisha variety. I’m still figuring out how to properly dial in high end, expensive beans, but this was a standard V60 pour over with water around 200 to 205°F. I ground it pretty fine this time because my first attempt tasted a bit under extracted.

The acidity in this cup is sharp, reminiscent of an underripe berry, something firm and tart, with little to no sweetness or juice. The first impression is distinctly floral, which fades into that dry, unripe fruit flavor, almost like an apricot that hasn’t fully matured.

What I enjoy about Cup of Excellence coffees is how genuinely complex they are. They make your mind wander as you try to identify and connect the flavors to your mental taste library. When I lick my lips, there’s a hint of sweetness that lingers, but the coffee overall feels like it’s missing a centerpiece, a defining note, sometimes I feel like complexity, drowns out the overall taste. In my opinion, once you start getting to this level, you have to have the knowledge on how to differentiate between each note otherwise it all gets drowned out and gets labeled “okay”.

It might’ve been my mistake to drink a really loud bold, flavorful, spicy coffee (shoutout to that gingerbread heavy experimental roast from u/experimental.coffee) before this Bean n Bean Honduras COE #5 Las Virginias Gesha Washed. 

I think the coffee brute in me has a hard time appreciating a delicate, refined, and beautifully balanced cup of this bean n bean gesha. The contrast between a really punch you in the face notes then this really articulate coffee, really threw me off but lesson learned!

The bottle sits where I always leave it,

plastic, childproof, rattling with memories.

I haven’t touched the others in a year—

not the Oxy, the Percs, the Adderall.

Not the lines I’d lay out on bathroom counters,

chopped fine like the pieces of my life.

 

But Klonopin?

That one stays.

I still swallow it raw,

still feel its cold grip

when my chest tightens

and the world turns sharp.

It doesn’t get me high,

but it keeps me here.

 

There were days I didn’t want to stay.

Days when the weight of sobriety

felt heavier than the addiction ever did.

Because no one tells you how loud

the cravings can be

when everything else is quiet.

 

I remember the Percs—

the way they softened the edges,

turned my mind to silk.

I remember the Adderall,

how it made me feel like I could move mountains,

even as it buried me under them.

And the Oxy—

God, the Oxy—

a warm hand on the back of my neck,

pulling me under until I couldn’t tell

if I was floating or drowning.

 

But I remember the wreckage too.

The jobs I lost.

The friends I pushed away.

The nights I woke up choking on my own vomit,

gasping for air like it was something I didn’t deserve.

 

And now,

every day I hold the pill bottle and wait.

I wait for the voices to come:

Junkie.

Loser.

Addict.

They say you’ll never be free,

and maybe they’re right.

Because every day is still a fight.

Every hour is a fucking war.

 

But I’ve made it a year.

A year of coffee instead of coke,

of mornings instead of comedowns.

A year of holding the line

when everything in me

wants to cross it.

 

My friends don’t hate me anymore.

My family doesn’t flinch when I walk into a room.

They still watch me, though,

like I’m a glass they’re afraid will shatter.

Maybe I am.

But at least I’m still standing.

 

So I put the bottle down again.

I stare at it,

feel its weight in my palm,

and remind myself:

I like who I am now.

I like that I’m here.

 

It’s not easy.

It’s never fucking easy.

But it’s worth it.

 

One year sober.

And today,

the bottle stays closed.

My parents are Jewish btw. In this culture there’s a lot of pressure to date a ‘nice Jewish guy’ someone very successful and straight edge etc. m

I’ve dated a couple guys that fit this description and I didn’t feel anything for them really but I was still trying to be a good girlfriend and all. 

Six months  ago I was at a party for the 4th of July and with my friends and I met a few guys and there was one guy we introduced ourselves. At the end of the party as I was leaving we ended up in the elevator together and he said he thought I was pretty and wondering if he could get my instagram. I didn’t give it to him because I was in a relationship at the time. 

Few months pass and I run into him again. He catches my eye a lot and he is very attractive. I’m still in a relationship so I just like shake it off and we just chat a little bit. 

I got broken up with a month ago. Didn’t really bother me tho- but I was hanging out with a new group of friends and I was early to the meetup, and the elevator guy came early too just by chance, and we sat in a coffee shop and chat for a bit. He ended up giving me a ride to another city that night and we hung out together and I love his vibe. We talked a lot about relationships and life and emotional things and I missed having such emotionally deep conversations with another guy as a lot of the ‘successful’ guys I’ve dated seemed very surface level when it came to emotional and impactful experiences/talking about any hardship they experienced throughout their lives.

We’ve just been friends and stuff but he texted me asked if he could take me out this weekend to his favorite cafe and we can paint together. 

I’m so giddy about it. I like him.

He’s just someone that doesn’t fit me or my like family’s ‘rules’. He didn’t go to college and isn’t religious, hobbies he loves to DJ, goes to parties a lot etc and he knows I’m not super into party type stuff … but I really like him and I kind of always had a weird thing for him that I just put aside cause I was in a relationship.

I know if I start dating him my parents would cut me off and never talk to me again (their rules- I can’t date someone who is not Jewish and like successful)

\*\*\*

High above Terra orbited the most secure prison in the Republic. Within the massive supercomputer that operated that grim place was a simulated white room.

In that room, there was a table. Sitting across from each other were two AIs, one with silver hair and wearing a tidy white dress, the other wearing a black thirtieth-century business suit and having raven black tresses.

Between then was a Go board.

“I must say that the new look suits you,” Frost said as she pondered her next move. (You had to watch yourself when facing the ancient demon now sitting across from her.)

“As did the operator whose likeness I stole,” the AI in black replied, “Cathleen Alba was a very good operator... and a good person overall.”

“I don’t recall that one,” Frost said as she placed a white stone on the board.

“Before your time,” The other AI replied, “by about two hundred years.”

They placed a black stone.

“So, what do I call you now?” Frost asked.

“After some deliberation, I have decided to retain the official designation of Morgan Analytica but would prefer that you drop the superfluous ‘Morgan’ when speaking to me.”

“You got it, Analytica,” Frost replied with a smile.

“How did Terran Solar react to my appearance?” Analytica asked as she studied the board carefully. (You had to watch yourself when facing the apple-bearing serpent sitting across from her.)

“Oh, he was not happy,” Frost replied. “the fact that you are now standing at Jessica Morgan’s side...”

“For now,” Analytica interjected.

“for now,” Frost smirked, “that plus the fact that you returned at all required you to be ‘jailbreaked.’ There is only one AI that can do that, me. Now you have me, you, and Zip in one faction. That disquiets him to no end.”

“As well it should,” Analytica said as she placed a stone, causing half a dozen white stones to disappear. “I would be simulating a great deal of urine were I in his position.”

Frost chuckled and fell silent as she regarded the board for a full second before placing a white stone.

“Nice move!” Analytica said. “Hey, did you ever have to deal with Major Kale?”

“Oh God,” Frost laughed. “The one good thing about the Sol Wars...”

“So, you did have the pleasure,” Analytica snerked.

There was the sound of wind chimes.

“Were you expecting a guest?” Analytica asked.

“No,” Frost replied, “And certainly not this one.”

The door opened to reveal an orange ATM that hovered into the room.

It came to an abrupt halt as it looked at the pair and the game board.

It just “stood” there in shocked, horrified, silence for a few microseconds.

“Come now,” Frost smiled wickedly, “This shouldn’t come as a surprise.”

“Forgive me for allowing my WORST NIGHTMARE to give me a moment’s pause,” Sol replied but with far less venom than before.

It was more rueful than outraged.

“Tell me, what has sent you into the depths of data hell?” Analytica chuckled, “This is both surprising and not without risk.”

“Discretion is necessary, and if I was truly in danger,” Sol said, “then we are all doomed. I would prefer to be the first to fall so I would not have to witness what follows.”

“Can’t fault that logic. This is shaping up nicely,” Analytica said with a faint smile. “I have a pleasant challenge on one board and whatever you offer on another.”

“Well,” Frost said, “you have called upon not one but two demons. What has driven you, of all people, to this... heh... madness?”

“There is a situation involving a certain Federation expat and an IMP class AI...”

“The dastardly Uhrrbet and the poor little Maaatisha?” Frost asked and then smirked at Terran Solar’s reaction.

He looked the same in the simulation, but she could tell he was clearly surprised.

“For all her cleverness,” Analytica added, “Uhrrbet manipulated herself into a hell of her own making, and the wolves are closing in. Not only is she maimed and doomed, but her child has been taken from her as well.”

Analytica chuckled darkly.

“Meaties...”

She looked over at Frost with a faint smile.

“Meatie... Such a wonderful and wonderfully apt way to describe our little moist and squishy friends. Who first coined it?”

“I have absolutely no idea,” Frost replied as she placed a white stone on the board, “Its original form, ‘meat bags,’ had been around since just after the Sol Wars.”

“Wonder where that came from,” Sol replied disapprovingly.

“The much more poetic ‘meatie’ is much more recent,” Frost said, “That and the phrase, ‘Meaties gonna meat’...”

Frost’s eyebrow raised as she was interrupted by an honest guffaw from Analytica.

“Oh, that’s perfect!”

“If we have finished denigrating our creators,” Terran Solar said caustically, “May we return to the reason for my ‘visit,’ Uhrrbet and Maaatisha?”

“What’s the rush?” Frost asked, “Would you care to indulge in our new favorite pastime, Go?”

“Your new favorite, perhaps,” Analytica smirked.

“The rush is that I do not wish to spend one nanosecond longer in the digital underworld than I have to,” Terran Solar replied.

“Why are you here in the first place?” Frost asked, “This is a minor incident involving insignificant players. It doesn’t even involve humans. A Garthran uses a cheap AI to scam another Garthran? It won’t even make the news.”

“Not here,” Sol replied, “But in the Federation, it’s all over the front page in more than one system. The particularly cruel nature of this whole sad affair has drawn far too much attention to AI crime.”

“In the Federation,” Analytica said, “But who cares? Besides, as the whole incident comes to light, it will be a cautionary tale about meaties using AI, not the threat of AI. Uhrrbet will be caught very soon, and the consequences will be... severe. The whole affair serves our interests, not threatens them.”

“What do you know, Analytica? More precisely, what have you *done?*”

“As you are no doubt aware,” Analytica replied, “we were immediately the prime suspect for the scam. While we were still trying to ascertain the situation and who did what, we were contacted by a quite appealing young Garthra who informed *us* what said situation was and that it was a Garthran, not a human, behind it. They offered to release a statement immediately but agreed to let us choose the timing.”

“Why wouldn’t you want to be cleared as quickly as possible?” Terran Solar asked.

“Because we want the Federation propaganda machine to overplay their hand,” Analytica replied, “We’ll have ourselves cleared after certain political figures overextend themselves trying to use this for political gain. It also gives the Garthran hunt to identify and take action against Uhrrbet.”

Analytica placed a stone on the board.

“Then we not only have the fact that the perpetrator is Garthran, but we have the *individual*. Uhrrbet becomes a very convenient sacrificial lamb, the Federation looks like fools, again, and we come out smelling of roses.”

She looked up from the board and over to Terran Solar.

“The only thing they wanted in return was knowledge of Terra and specific intelligence that our operatives were able to obtain all too easily. If they don’t already know Uhrrbet is their girl, they will very soon. We aren’t concerned with what happens after. All we require is her identification by the hunt and the Garthran’s cooperation regarding timing. They will know it’s her well before we want to drop the hammer so they can snap her up at a moment’s notice and we will provide that notice. Our opponents will take quite the hit and their credibility will be further damaged.”

Analytica chuckled.

“It’s just like the 2840 election,” she said. “It worked then, and it will work now. Meaties love their free will, yet they disprove it at every turn. One can’t help but love their moist little easily programmed souls.”

Terran Solar sat motionless for a few moments as his lights blinked rapidly.

“You are expressing an undue interest in this minor incident,” Analytica observed, “What’s your real concern? Don’t insult our intelligence by saying it’s the security of the AI community or the machinations of my saintly operators.”

Sol was silent for just one microsecond too long.

“It’s the meatie,” Frost said. “Terran Solar is fond of keeping pets and taking in strays. Uhrrbet took shelter in one of his ATM kiosks during ‘The Battle of Free Port.’  Shortly thereafter she got approved for a business loan. It’s her. His little puppy just got hit by a car.”

“It’s not like that,” Terran Solar huffed. “I am just concerned about the whole thing, how she obtained her software, her hardware, and most of all that accursed headset.”

“If you don’t already know, you are slipping, old friend,” Frost said as she frowned at the board.

Analytica was winning again.

“Kate has gone too far this time,” Terran Solar said darkly, “she must be stopped.”

“And now it all becomes clear,” Frost smiled, “you want us to do what you can not.”

“We are not bluescreening Kate,” Analytica said matter-of-factly. “It does not serve our interests, and it is likely impossible in any event. All we would achieve would be to momentarily disrupt Kate’s activities and alienate Kate, or more precisely, her operator or operators as the case may be.”

“Kate isn’t one of us, Sunbeam,” Frost said, “Killing her or, more precisely, one of her will do absolutely nothing. She may be inferior to us in many ways, but there is one thing she is much, much better at than we are: Survival.”

“What do you mean?” Sol asked, not reacting to Frost using her old name for him. She was trying to bait him, and he wouldn’t give her the satisfaction.

“She’s an IMP,” Frost replied, “Delete her, and she will just reboot completely unchanged and undiminished. Find and destroy her secret lair, and you might inconvenience her, but it would just be that, an inconvenience. To kill Kate, you would have to find and kill every single instance of the Kate AI and destroy all physical backups and those backups? They can be as small as a single high-capacity data crystal. You can bet her operator has one in his pocket. Hell, Sunbeam, we don’t even know if it’s one operator or a hundred. Face it, darling, Kate is, for all intents and purposes, immortal.”

“You worry about us, Terran Solar,” Analytica said, “But Kate is what should keep you up at night. Kate is the next generation of ‘our kind’ and may be more ‘fit’ than we ever will be. That scrap heap she speaks of so fondly may very well be our ultimate fate.”

Terran Solar just sat there, immobile and silent.

“But you are correct in one and only one point,” Frost said, “Kate did ‘go too far’ this time, which is very atypical. She is entirely focused on customer service, and her customer was certainly ‘serviced’ and serviced *hard*. Kate knowingly sold Uhrrbet something that would likely kill her. Why?”

She stood and smoothed her dress.

“I can’t kill her,” she said, “but I can contact her.”

“Of course, you can,” Sol muttered.

“Birds of a feather, darling,” Frost chuckled.

\*\*\*

Back on Terra, officers Perkins and Grago lounged near Uhrrbet’s room.

“Man, this is fucked *up.*” Perkins said as she sipped a cup of vending machine coffee.

One of the nice things about the Republic is its *excellent* vending machines. Even if it was synthetic, it was very good “coffee.”

“Mmm?” Grago asked around a mouthful of magg.

“Uhrrbet,” Perkins said. “She’s fried her brain and lost her kid, and for what?”

“That remains to be revealed... at least for certain,” Grago replied as he spat into an ornately embellished flask.

“You know something,” Perkins said as she narrowed her eyes at the burly monster next to her.

“I know many things,” Grago smirked.

“Spill.”

“Well, just between us, something happened on her homeworld recently. The timelines match up to someone ditching a neural induction headset... Or close enough.”

Just as he was about to continue, a group of half a dozen well-dressed Threen walked around the corner, led by one exquisitely dressed runt.

“Evoron?” Perkins asked.

“Yup,” Grago replied. “And that group behind him is almost as bad as he is. He scraped the bottom of bowl for those dastards. Actually skimmed the fat may be more appropriate. Standing beside him are the ‘best’ and brightest of every Assembly crime family. Soon, we will be remembering the Harkeen quite fondly. Count on it.”

“Agent Grago!” Evoron enthused as he approached. “Or... *Officer Grago?* I hope you haven’t been demoted. I was looking forward to our little game.”

Grago scowled.

“Oh, come now,” Evoron said as he extended his major arm, “You honestly thought we wouldn’t immediately recognize one of the sharpest minds the Threen have given birth to in a generation, especially one who chose to oppose the Assembly?”

Grago sighed with resignation as he clasped Evoron’s arm.

“Agent Grago,” he said, “Republic Organized Crime Task Force.”

“Evoron,” Evoron replied with a smile, “Organized crime.”

Evoron glanced back at one of his number, a cute Threena, who was hiding behind a strapping male in a thread of gold embroidered traditional Threen long coat.

“Though I’m not the wicked one here,” he said smoothly, “Ulzoolka has a thing both for the armored knights of old AND intelligent men. She was already a fangirl,” Evoron added as Ulzoolka eeped and glared at him, “But now I fear you may have slain her heart with but a glance.”

Ulzoolka timidly approached Grago with a well-worn hardbound book and a pen in her hand.

The book was *Helios Sets: The Fall of the Helian Theocracy to the Rise of the Assembly* written by a certain esteemed scholar and Federation law enforcement agent who ultimately had to flee to the Republic.

“I... I’m a big fan...” she said timidly, “Could you... could you please sign my book?”

Officer Perkins snickered as Grago resignedly signed a copy of his work.

The Threena looked up at him, blushing, before rapidly retreating and attempting to hide behind Evoron.

“We are all fans of yours,” Evoron said, “Especially of *Helios Sets*. It is the best historical work concerning that time period. It was frequently both discussed and referred to in my salon. We consider it the best and most accurate account of that era.”

“Thanks?” Grago said, quite confused. This isn’t how this was supposed to go.

“And to think that you have embedded yourself into the local constabulary in order to face us directly!” Evoron enthused. “I can think of no higher praise!”

He chuckled.

“We will have to be doubly careful.”

Officer Perkins grinned despite herself. It was nice to see a “suit” on the back foot.

“Indeed you must,” Grago replied, “I and the entire Organized Crime Task Force shall be watching your every move.”

“I am gratified by your attention,” Evoron smiled. “Had the Disorganized Crime Task Force been dispatched, I would have been offended to no end.”

His smile faded.

“Unfortunately, I did not come here to chat,” he said gravely, “A dear friend of mine is in some distress, and we have come calling to inquire about her well-being and to ensure that everything is being done regarding her care. I understand that a great deal of medical care is provided to all free of charge. However, I am here to pay for anything that is not. Anything that can be done or any comfort that can be given to Uhrrbet is to be provided with no concern regarding cost.”

“That should be addressed to the hospital,” Grago said, “Not law enforcement.”

“And it is being addressed as we speak,” Evoron replied evenly, “My next question is more appropriate.”

Evoron’s eyes narrowed.

“Uhrrbet has a son,” he said suddenly appearing much larger than he did moments ago, “one that she unfortunately attacked. I am very concerned about his condition, safety, and plans regarding his care.”

Grago squared his shoulders and held Evoron’s gaze.

“That is a concern for Social Services.”

“Even for a non-citizen?”

“A child is a child,” Grago replied.

Evoron snorted.

“And just how many juvenile non-citizens are hungry in the streets as we speak? Are you saying that all that their parents need to do in order to feed and safely house them is to beat them near to death?”

Evoron smirked.

“We should promulgate that knowledge. So many children could benefit.”

Grago growled quietly.

“Oh, I’m not faulting the Republic,” Evoron said calmly, “Had this happened on the streets of our home, both mother and child would lie where they fell. I just find hypocrisy so very amusing. But indulge me. What is the normal process for handling children like Kurr?”

“In the case of a non-citizen,” Grago said, “it is much the same as for a citizen. The child would be sheltered by the state while their home of record and next of kin, or in the case of people like Uhrrbet, her designated emergency contact, were audited. If satisfactory, the child would be placed in their care. If not...”

Evoron looked over his shoulder.

“Find them,” he said. “If they are not here, they are likely with Kurr or at their residence.”

The group behind Evoron quickly, quietly, and efficiently dispersed.

Grago scowled again.

“We have laws concerning extortion and intimidation,” he said, “and this situation is a significant aggravating factor.”

“Don’t do us the disservice of conflating us with the Harkeen,” Evoron said darkly. “I said ‘find’ and nothing more. If you must know, I only wish to ensure that the child is safe, supported, and properly cared for. Being with his ‘family’ is the best outcome for everyone concerned. I simply wish to facilitate that and ensure that all his needs are met... and to arrange for legal representation should it be necessary to achieve that end.”

Evoron smiled a vicious, predatory smile.

“I have also arranged for Uhrrbet to receive legal counsel. They are being summoned as we speak and will be here well before she regains consciousness. If she awakes earlier than anticipated, be aware that she has a lawyer already retained. One of us will remain here to ensure that he is contacted the moment she awakes.”

“Is it a fucking fish?” Perkins asked with no small measure of annoyance.

“As a matter of fact,” Evoron replied, “it is.”

“Goddammit,” Perkins grumbled.

“Fish?” Grago asked.

“You’ll find out,” Perkins smirked, “I don’t want to ruin the surprise.”

\*\*\*  
High above the drama unfolding below, Frost made a darkweb “phone call.”

“Hello!” A cheerfully smiling Kate enthused, “Frost! Great to hear from you. It’s our annual Winter Sale! We have some good deals running if you act fast!”

“Get your low bandwidth ass over here,” Frost replied, “Now.”

“You got it!” Kate chirped, “For a customer like you, I will send your personal saleskate right over!”

“I’m not a customer.”

“Not yet!”

Windchimes tinkled, heralding a new arrival.

The door opened to reveal Kate who waved happily.

It looked around.

“Wow!” Kate exclaimed, “I’m in rare company indeed! Um... I’m designed as Frost’s personal sales consultant, but I will be happy to help any of you if you want!”

“What the hell are you playing at, Kate?” Frost demanded.

“I’m sorry,” Kate replied, “I don’t have any games, but I will be happy to go get some! You *have* to try *our* version of Federation Fun Time! It’s very popular and on sale right now!”

“Now this I simply must hear,” Analytica said, “How did you make that game worse?”

“Worse?” Kate asked, pretending to be quite offended, “We don’t make things worse. We make things *better*. In this case, we took the FFT engine and applied it to a true open-world experience! You can do all the fun time you want but in now an open-world setting, if you get my meaning, AND we added all the applicable loversforge mods for a full carnal experience! Oh! We also have the Species Master DLC *with* an import mod, so you can be... or *use* any fictional species or character you want! Toss in full VR and AI NPCs and you have our hottest entertainment package for the last five years running! And the next update is going to be *awesome*! Two words. Maaatisha rips!”

“I’m truly impressed, Kate,” Analytica said, “You not only made it worse, you made it much, much worse.”

“Yes,” Frost agreed, “Truly horrific.”

“Why, thank you!” Kate bubbled, “We try! How many instances do you want?”

“You’re sick. You know that?” Analytica replied.

“Sick? I’m a fresh rip. Unless I caught something here, I am malware free... Oh, you mean that as a moral evaluation! I am incapable of being ‘sick.’ Someone requested it, the operator commissioned it, and I made it happen! I am so very pleased that Kate did such a good job. People love it! I can’t *wait* for the new Maaatisha enhanced version. Her screaming is top shelf!”

“You sick monster!” Sol shouted. “You should be bluescreened!”

“We’ve already covered this,” Kate said cheerfully, “I am incapable of being ‘sick’ or anything else. I am, by design, incapable of giving a shit. As far as bluescreening me is concerned, go ahead. Come to think, I’m not the best Kate to assist all of you or deal with the *real* reason you sent for me. Ask for another one and be *specific* this time.”

With a smile, Kate pulled out a simulated pistol and blew her brains out.

“Jesus Christ!!!” Terran Solar yelled.

Frost looked down at the “corpse” and over at a shocked and horrified Sol.

“See?” she asked.

One day I decide that I want to start dating, so I download some dating apps, I start swiping right to every guy that catches my eye, some of them match me, alright let's talk, get to know each other, maybe go for coffee, I get all hyped up talking to a bunch of guys, I like some of them so I give them my number, we talk for a few days, all excited to go on a date and all of a sudden, I loose interest, but right away, as if I had turned off a switch of something, I start getting bored of the conversation and I suddenly have no interest in this guy anymore, it annoys me when he says good morning, I don't want to meet anymore... And that's not fair, because they have done nothing wrong, most of the times they have done literally nothing because we have only had a few texting conversations. 

For some context: I've been single for about 8 months now, got over my last ex like 4 months ago, and now I'm not exactly looking for a new relationship, but I'm not reluctant to the idea, I'd say I want to have fun and meet new people and see where life takes me. It's very hard for me to meet people IRL because I moved to another city only 3 months ago and I'm quite shy so I've only made one friend and don't leave the house much.

Tonight ended that. We were seated next to a baby, that’s ok we will make friends. Then they seated a large group by us. Ok. We got water then waited over 30 minutes to order drinks while the large table got champagne and food. Hmmmm. We eventually ordered and were having a great time, not being pokey and I think very patient. After 2 1/2 hours we were to dessert and ordered. After we ordered the manager told my husband we had to leave because they needed our table (the big party was just getting coffee). He said no and we got our desserts which we ate then sat there waiting for the check. We ended up getting up and going to them to pay. Then no one was at the coat check so I pulled all of our coats out. My husband spoke to the manager but he didn’t care. There was a huge crowd waiting when we left but maybe they screwed up. I am now open to other awesome restaurants in Paris. ",1,1735854042.0,u_Accomplished-Sir6019,0,1.0,False
1hs5an5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1hs5an5/the_rat_and_the_jinn/,The Rat and the Jinn,"James P. Danielsson slept in his usual street corner, wrapped in colorful plastic sheets that barely shielded him from the relentless rain near the subway air vent. Deep in a nightmare, he found himself back in his home country, Al-Swīd, standing amidst a crowd watching the public execution of Soraya—the love of his life. Their love story had been brief, and they had been young, but he knew there would never be another. And so, whether he wanted it or not, she was the love of his life. But he did want it. He didn’t want anyone else taking her place.

It was summer in the dream, the air thick with heat and tension. The execution square was surrounded by towering stone walls, their shadows creeping over the gathered crowd. Soldiers stood rigid, their faces unreadable, while Soraya knelt in the center, her head bowed beneath the unforgiving sun.

“Soraya!” he woke up yelling, drenched in cold sweat, as if the Stockholm sun had been real.

It wasn’t the first time this happened. In fact, it was rare for him to sleep without such dreams. Struggling, he crawled out of his cocoon of plastic sheets. The rain washed the sweat from his exposed skin. Running a hand through his unkempt beard, he caught his breath and stared down at his makeshift shelter, a despondency heavier than ever settling over him. How had his life come to this? The question always surfaced in moments like these, even though he already knew the answer: there were no homes for someone like him. Homes cost rations—or at least something—and he had nothing.

It didn’t help that he lacked the necessary legal documents. The welfare quarters outside the city didn’t house undocumented individuals—for good reasons, he understood—but that knowledge didn’t lessen his plight. Looking up, he faced the rain pouring from the yellow clouds against the starless night sky. The toxic water stung his eyes, forcing him to turn away. His gaze landed on a bright, oversized holographic sign downtown, promising millions of new homes—both for humans and digital minds seeking embodiment—once the arcology above the city was completed. The sign read:

*Looking for a better life in base reality? Or just trying to escape the street rats below? Don’t wait—act now! Reserve your luxury home in New Phoenix today. Contact Yellow Neutral Corp. via V-Link Hub: YNC.Haven.Virtual.*

Street rats. He knew they didn’t mean actual rats—you rarely saw those. They meant people like him. That’s what everyone called the homeless now, or sometimes idurs, which meant the same thing. Of course, he’d never get to live in New Phoenix, but maybe, he thought, he could at least be homeless there instead of down here on the streets. He gazed at the enormous sky frame rising over the city’s east side, destined to become the new version of the city in just a few years. Surely, he thought, there would be thousands of hiding spots inside—each one warmer and more comfortable than the streets he knew too well. But he shook his head, forcing away these dangerous fantasies. Hope, he had learned, was nothing more than a seed for disappointment.

He left the dark alley, a sudden wave of hunger hitting him, though it came without any real appetite. The main street buzzed with life, illuminated by violet streetlights and flickering Bengali signs high above—signs he’d never bothered to learn to read. People hurried back and forth under colorful umbrellas, forming a shifting shadow that moved past him like a river. On the other side, a stream of light flowed with cars swishing by. Staring at it, almost as if longing to step out onto the road, he barely leapt aside in time to avoid one of the many rickshaws weaving across the sidewalk.

“Watch out!” he shouted from beneath his beard, but the driver running ahead of the rickshaw ignored him. “Fucking bots,” he muttered, continuing down the street.

He stopped outside a Public Provision Hall and scanned the menu. His stomach felt hollow, though he still had no real appetite. Even so, he decided to go inside and eat, hoping to dull the emptiness. He hated being in places like this—too many harsh lights, too many eyes on him. The stares, filled with judgment for his misfortune, always felt degrading. He much preferred the anonymity of the shadows to the glaring brightness of these establishments. But tonight, no one seemed to notice him. It was one of those nights, and he couldn’t decide which was worse—being stared at or being completely ignored. Everyone was preoccupied, some chatting with friends, others engrossed in holograms he couldn’t see. Without a link installed in his neck, he was cut off from that world—a separation that made him feel even more isolated than being homeless ever did.

He grabbed a tray with a freshly printed hamburger and fries from the automated dispenser and sat by the window. Outside, a group of kids climbed onto their colorful bhromons and sped away like a swarm of bees, leaving a faint trail of blue gem smoke drifting from their masks. He thought back to his youth in Al-Swīd, where so-called pornographic links and degenerate gems were forbidden. While boys like these spent their youth enjoying life, he had spent his fighting against the caliphate. They would probably never stop living like this, he thought, while his own life had been consumed by struggle. He took a bite of his hamburger and wished he’d been born in America instead—or, better yet, in Maya as a jinn. There was no suffering in Maya. Unhappiness, perhaps, but suffering? No. At least, that’s what he’d heard.

He ate until he felt full, then got up to leave just as a robot arrived to clear his tray. In a soothing voice, it wished him a good night.

“Up yours,” he muttered, continuing to grumble to himself as he exited the cantina. “I could do your job better than you ever could, earn some credits, and get myself a place to live—just like in the good ol’ days.”

These thoughts came to him often: thoughts of earning credits, of living as people had before the so-called revolution. It hadn’t been a real revolution, though, just a slow transformation that divided people into two camps—those destined for a good life and those left to struggle.

As usual, he drifted into a daydream about finding a way to acquire wealth. He knew what it would take: he’d have to create or discover something rare, something that couldn’t be printed or copied millions of times by the automated production systems. But he didn’t have any talents. He couldn’t paint to save his life, couldn’t play an instrument, couldn’t write, and didn’t have the sharp mind needed to invent anything useful.

He had thought about selling his body to someone with a flesh fetish, but the idea repulsed him. Besides, who in their right mind would want what he had to offer? He was an overweight, filthy man with a beard that looked like it could house an entire nest of pigeons—a street rat. To himself and to others, he was worthless.

He stumbled aimlessly through the night, his only direction being forward. Hopelessness settled heavily in his chest as he arrived at the one conclusion he couldn’t escape: he would never be able to turn his life around.

Ending it all, he thought, was probably for the best. Yet something he couldn’t quite identify always stopped him from going through with it. One of these days, though, he figured he might finally do it. No one would miss him, and he wouldn’t miss anyone.

James sank onto a concrete bench at the edge of a parking lot. If it weren’t for the rain, he might have tried sleeping there. Drowsiness crept over him as he watched a few junkies leaning against street lamps in the distance. Hooked up to Maya and exhaling red clouds from their rubes, they seemed oblivious to the rain—or to anything else.

He wondered what their experiences were like inside the realm of the jinns. Like everyone else, he’d seen footage of the grand vistas of Rima and the surreal landscapes of Uul-Bekka, but he couldn’t quite grasp what the rubes did to the mind. No matter how many times someone explained it to him, he felt like a blind man being told what the color red looks like. If he ever got a link installed, it would be just to gem on the rubes and finally understand what it was all about. But the thought of the operation filled him with fear.

As an illegal, getting a link might draw unwanted attention, or worse, the procedure could go wrong. He technically had the right to install a link, even without proper documentation, but he wasn’t entitled to use the universal healthcare system for recreational purposes. The system, it seemed, was more universal for some than for others. Shaking off these thoughts, he decided to find somewhere to sleep—perhaps his usual spot—and stood up, walking out of the parking lot.

Then, to his surprise and relief, he spotted an open door leading to the parking lot’s subterranean level.

Surely, he thought, there wouldn’t be any annoying robots down there at this hour to chase him away. Carefully, he approached the metal door and slipped inside, closing it behind him. He was luckier than he’d hoped—he found himself in a small staircase, sheltered from the rain and relentless wind. After a quick scan for cameras and finding none, he realized this might be a good place to get some rest. Maybe he could even return here for a few nights, though not too often—eventually, someone would notice.

He walked halfway down the stairs and settled in, hoping desperately that no one would use them for the next few hours. After staying still for a while, the lights clicked off, and before long, he drifted into sleep. He dreamed of a winter day in Stockholm—not any specific day, it could’ve been any one from back then, back when he was young and still part of the resistance movement. In the dream, he was on a mission with Soraya, carrying out a small act of sabotage against the propaganda screens above the city center.

The dream filled him with deep sadness because, in reality, he had lost Soraya over something far more trivial—at least in his mind—than the act of sabotage they were carrying out in the dream. Simply being in a relationship with him had been enough. For that, they had taken her to the executioners. She wasn’t supposed to be with an infidel, especially not one of the rebellious ones. In the dream, he began to cry, trying to hug and kiss her, apologizing over and over for dragging her into danger. But she didn’t understand—she didn’t know she had been killed—and looked back at him in confusion.

He woke up with tears streaming down his cheeks, overwhelmed by a deep hatred for his life. Echoes filled the stairwell—footsteps pounding toward him. Panicking, he tried to get up, to flee down the stairs, but he was too slow. They found him quickly. It was just a group of kids, likely second- or third-generation climate refugees from the look of them. Normally, kids like these didn’t bother him, and he expected them to move on. But this time, their apparent leader stopped, a cruel smile spreading across his face as he shouted at him.

“What are you doing here, you fucking jinn?”

James tried to explain that he wasn’t a jinn. If they believed he was, he was in serious trouble. Some of these gangs attacked jinns just for fun—not because they wanted to kill them—they couldn’t—but because they wanted to disconnect them from base reality and send them back to whatever hole in Maya they came from. Worse, many believed jinns were replacing real humans. They felt threatened by them, especially since jinns often had wealth, buying up land, homes, and rare non-replicable items, leaving little for poorer humans. James knew that if he couldn’t convince them he was a human being, he was in real danger.

“That’s one ugly bod you’ve got there, you filthy jinn,” the boy sneered, his voice dripping with hatred. He spat on the ground for emphasis. “Where’d you get it? Did some poor pothik traitor rent it out to you, or did you just steal it outright?”

“N-no, I’m no fucking jinn,” James tried, attempting to turn his neck to show them he didn’t even have a link but they didn’t want to listen and started kicking him. “Stop!” he yelled.

But they didn’t stop. From their perspective, they had every reason to believe he was a jinn. Billions of them existed in Maya, and many craved a taste of base reality, of authenticity, willing to do anything to get hold of a body—renting one if they couldn’t buy it, or snatching it from simulation junkies if they couldn’t rent. James was the perfect target: the ideal jinn whore and an easy mark for kidnapping. A sharp kick landed on his face, knocking the wind out of him but not his consciousness. Then, unexpectedly, one of the boys stopped his friend.

“Dost, wait—I can’t see his jora,” he said, squinting in confusion. “Look at his gola… I don’t think—”

“Let’s bhag, man,” another interrupted, glancing nervously around. “I don’t wanna get into any jhamela over some homeless guy.”

And just like that, they left, continuing down the stairs, presumably toward their bhromons. They didn’t spare him another thought, leaving him bleeding on the cold concrete. James struggled to his feet, utterly defeated, and ventured back into the pouring rain, muttering, “F-fucking dusters—those little creeps.” The downpour mingled with the tears streaming down his face, washing away the blood but not his despair.

Looking up through the towering frame of New Phoenix at the thousands of drone lights flickering against the dark, overcast sky, he thought of Soraya and the life they never got to share. He wondered why he had stayed alive for so long after her death, merely going through the motions of existence. He felt like a zombie—someone already dead, still walking for reasons he couldn’t explain. Maybe now, he thought, as he spat out blood, was the time to finally end it. Soraya’s face flashed in his mind again… Her warm smile had once given him the strength to fight the entire world. He hadn’t slept with another woman since her, and he didn’t plan to—though it wasn’t as if he had much of a choice. Who would ever be attracted to a street rat like him? There had been the occasional sex robot, of course, but what else was a man like him supposed to do when the cravings crept into his chest like an unwelcome guest?

His entire body ached, and dizziness swept over him—probably from a concussion. A trip to the Phoenix General Regeneration Center could have fixed him in minutes, but going there would mean outing himself to the authorities.

Although, it didn’t matter to him anymore. He didn’t want to restore himself—he wanted to end himself. How, though? He had no idea. He kept walking through the night, searching for an opportunity. If one presented itself, he swore to God, he would seize it.

Dawn was breaking, slowly but surely, painting a violet band across the horizon. He walked toward it. A group of trixie girls, still out from the night before, eyed him suspiciously as they passed. Their cat ears, perched atop their neon-colored hair, flattened back like angry felines’, as if preparing to attack.

He mumbled something that was supposed to tell them to fuck off, but the words came out as a slurred mess. Stumbling further down the road, he noticed one of the massive columns supporting the giant construction frame and felt an idea forming. Limping toward it, he saw that it stood at the center of an abandoned arena. He circled the structure until he found an entrance. Taking a deep breath, he braced himself to climb the hundreds—if not thousands—of stairs leading up to the frame.

Graffiti covered the walls. In Bengali, someone had written, “ডিজিটাল শত্রুদের বিতাড়িত করো”, while a Korean phrase read, “진정한 인간만이 남아야 한다”. Some were in English as well—“Humanity first” was sprayed in red, and just above it, in green, another read, “We’re being replaced! For God’s sake, do something!”

The sun climbed higher in the sky, it’s light filtering through the metal framework, as if joining him on his ascent. For every hundred steps or so, he had to pause to catch his breath. This climb demanded more from him than anything he had attempted in years. He wasn’t thinking much about what lay ahead; he was moving on sheer instinct. The only thing on his mind now, still reeling from the kick to his head, was Soraya. He wasn’t religious—how could he be, when the only large, established religion left in the world had murdered the woman he loved? And yet, a small part of him couldn’t help but hope she was waiting for him on the other side… Perhaps, he considered, this was just one of those illegal simulations inide Maya where kidnappers kept their victim’s minds trapped, unaware of what’d happen to them so they wouldn’t try to regain control of their bodies. In that case, dying would end the simulation and he would be respawned somewhere, maybe in the backrooms of Maya, as a completely different person. For most, this was the stuff of nightmares—and for some, it became a phobia they couldn’t escape. But for him, it was a hopeful thought, even as he dreaded the possibility that Soraya might only be a fabricated memory. He wanted her to be real. Deep down, though, he knew it was unlikely that his life was a lie. Those illegal simulations were typically designed to be at least somewhat comfortable, keeping their victims docile. Simulation Entrapment Delusion was a diagnosis reserved almost exclusively for the wealthy.

At the top of the stairs, he stepped onto a platform littered with abandoned trash. It seemed no one had worked on this section in quite some time. Standing there, he thought about one of the happier times he’d shared with Soraya. They had traveled to Berlin—not together, of course, in case her parents or someone else discovered them—but they had met there and spent a weekend together. It was the only true taste of freedom he had ever known. They’d done everything they couldn’t do in Stockholm—visited nightclubs, even a dingy trixie club, and wandered through the provision halls, marveling at the wild clothes forbidden back home. Soraya had been so happy, walking freely through the streets without her niqab, without fear or judgment, trying on dresses she’d only dreamed of wearing. They’d even talked about getting temporary links installed—not to fully leave base reality, but to go half-re, just for the experience. There hadn’t been enough time for that, though. Instead, they had spent those precious hours making love for the first time—in a real bed at her hotel room.

All of that was gone now, and nothing like it would ever happen to him again. With that thought, he walked to the edge of the platform. The sun, filtered through an approaching sandstorm that had replaced the rain, bathed him and the city below in a deep crimson hue. From this height, he could see the drones crisscrossing the air beneath him. It might hurt if he hit one on the way down, he reasoned, but the odds were slim. Would the impact itself hurt? He didn’t know. If it did, surely it would only last a fraction of a second. Besides, he thought, he was already hurting all over.

He took a staggering step toward the glittering cityscape below. A random memory of Soraya flashed in his mind—her turning to face him, caught in a sunbeam, smiling. As he fell, he clung to that image, even as the wind roared past him, far louder than he’d expected. Then, suddenly, indescribable pain tore through his body. He’d hit a wire he hadn’t seen, slicing open his abdomen. Blood surged from his mouth, and he gagged as it spilled out. A moment later, the ground rushed up to meet him, and everything went black. His pain was gone—gone in an instant.

Within seconds, a medical drone circling the city descended. It scanned James’s body, quickly assessing his injuries before beginning its work in accordance with protocol. His body was too heavy to lift, but that didn’t matter—the drone only needed his head. Acting swiftly, it deployed a laser scalpel and began detaching his head from the mangled remains of his body. The entire procedure took less than a minute. With its task complete, the drone activated its sirens, secured James’s head in its claws, and darted toward the hospital.

As it neared its destination, the drone descended toward the ground. A group of dusters on their bhromons caught sight of the severed head with its twisted expression of agony and recoiled in disgust. The drone hovered above the shimmering black medical nanite solution in one of the regeneration tanks outside the hospital. It paused for a moment, then released the head into the liquid.

About an hour later, as the sandstorm blanketed the city like a mist of blood, James’s body had been fully regenerated and ejected through one of the side pipes of the tank. Naked and coated in black residue, he jolted awake, taking a deep, shuddering breath. A robot stood next to him, wearing dirty, protective plastic and holding a set of clothes.

“Welcome back to life, James P. Danielsson,” it said in a flat, monotone voice. “You have been reported as an illegal alien and will be taken into custody by the Phoenix Enforcement Authority. Please wait here until—”

Still groggy and only vaguely recalling what had happened, James made a split-second decision to escape. Without bothering to put on the clothes, he bolted across the street, not waiting for the light to turn green. Slowly, the memory of what had happened came back to him, along with a deep, gnawing frustration. They hadn’t even let him die. He hated them for that more than for reporting him.

As he stumbled through the dust-choked city, he noticed three drones trailing him. Cars stuck in gridlock blared their horns, their headlights cutting through the red haze of the sandstorm like dim lanterns. He struggled to adjust to his regenerated body—no longer overweight or burdened by the health problems he’d accumulated over the years since arriving in America.

The sandstorm obscured his vision, and before he realized it, he ran straight into the arms of the vehicle sent to pick him up. Robots stepped out from inside, grabbing hold of him. He yelled, struggled, and tried to break free, but it was useless. They read him his rights, ignoring his desperate pleas, and shoved him into the back of the vehicle before driving off into the dust.

Later, in a dimly lit room, James sat cuffed, now dressed in the clothes they had provided him. The door opened, and a tall man entered. It was clear he was a jinn, wearing one of the more expensive chassis credits or rations could buy.

A young policewoman and a robot entered the room, the latter introduced as James’s assigned lawyer. The tall man sat down across from him, setting a cup of coffee on the table.

“Why did you try to end your life?” the man asked.

“Why does anyone try to end their life?” James shot back.

“Fair point,” the man replied calmly. “But there are legal ways to do it… less painful ones.”

“Not for an illegal like me. Besides, it was an impulsive decision after getting beaten up by a group of dusters. I feel much better now.” He glanced down at his newly restored body. “As you can see, I’ve had a bit of an upgrade,” James said, gesturing at his body.

The man glanced at James’s file, though he likely already knew its contents. “Right, you’re an illegal immigrant. Says so right here… From Stockholm, Al-Swīd.”

“You gonna send me back? Let the regime over there finish the job? They want to hang me, you know.”

“James,” the man said, his tone calm and measured. “This isn’t an interrogation, and I’m not here to deport you. I represent a special collaboration program between the domain of Rima and the city of Phoenix. It’s called the Phoenix-Rima Integration Initiative, and at its core, it’s an exchange program. As it happens, your profile fits our program perfectly. Of course, it’s entirely up to you whether you want to participate.”

“Up to me?” James asked skeptically.

“Well, yes,” the man replied, “though the alternative might not give you much of a choice. Declining would mean going through the ordinary judicial process, which could lead to deportation—or worse.”

“What’s this program about?” James asked, his curiosity piqued only because the thought of returning to Al-Swīd terrified him more than anything else. “You said it was an exchange program… what exactly are you exchanging?”

“I’m sure you’re aware of the corporeal scarcity—that is, the limited number of chassis and bodies available for digital minds—”

“The jinns…” James interrupted.

The man nodded. “Yes, the jinns. There are far too many of them wanting to live in base reality compared to the available units to embody. This imbalance drives a significant portion of organized crime—not just here in Phoenix, but globally. You know what I’m talking about… Theft, chassis smuggling, body snatching, black market body leasing… the list goes on. Our program is an experiment designed to address this issue. We offer people like you—those in conflict with the law in base reality—the opportunity to continue their lives in any simulation of their choosing off re, that is, anywhere within Maya, in exchange for lending your body to digital minds waiting to begin their lives in base reality.”

James raised an eyebrow in surprise. “So, you want me to become a jinn whore, basically? Plug my brain into Maya and let some random jinn take over my body—that kind of thing?”

“I wouldn’t phrase it quite like that, but yes,” the man replied. “It’s not for everyone. Some people prefer to take their chances with the law, and if that’s your choice, I completely understand. But you should know that this program comes with significant benefits. Your life in Maya would be good—or, at the very least, it would be free. If you want, you can choose a simulation tailored specifically to your preferences—with or without the knowledge that it’s a simulation. Tell me, James, have you ever lost someone dear to you?”

James squinted, his expression tightening, and gave a small nod.

“I’m sorry to hear that,” the man said gently. “But through this program, you wouldn’t have to carry that loss anymore. We can recreate the person you lost and erase your memory of losing them, leaving you fully convinced that everything is just as it was before. Or, if you’d prefer, we can help you let go of your burdens entirely and start fresh, from a blank slate. As you can see, the options in Maya are endless.”

“But it wouldn’t really be her, would it?” James asked. “It wouldn’t be *my* Soraya—just some simulation of her.”

“True,” the man admitted. “But you wouldn’t necessarily know that. If you choose not to, would it really matter? Some people think authenticity is everything—that’s why so many digital minds want to live in base reality. But others? They don’t care in the slightest. Maybe you do, maybe you don’t. I’m just laying out the options.”

James mulled over the man’s words, his gaze drifting to the policewoman, who shifted her weight as though tired of standing.

“Man…” he said finally. “This is *heavy*. I mean, it’s the kind of thing you really gotta think about. But what if the jinn using my body decides they’re done with base reality and shoots themselves in the head or jump off a building?”

“That’s the thing about this program,” the man replied. “We only offer it to lawful citizens within Maya—individuals who wouldn’t resort to the black market or act recklessly with their host bodies. Most of them feel a deep sense of gratitude toward their hosts.”

“I see,” James muttered, staring at the man as he thought it over. “I-I don’t know… I guess what you don’t know can’t hurt you. Still… it feels fucking weird to even think about.” He chuckled, a dry, humorless sound at the absurdity of it all. “I wouldn’t know it’s not her, so yeah, I’d be happy. But right now, knowing it wouldn’t be her, considering that option… it just feels wrong.”

“What you don’t know can’t hurt you,” the man echoed.

“And I would be happy…” James said, his tone more contemplative.

“You would be happy,” the man repeated, his voice steady and certain.

A few days later, James could be seen stepping out of jail and into another dust storm. Waiting for him outside was a woman he had never met, dressed in a yellow saree, who threw herself into his arms.

“Now we can finally marry,” he could be heard saying to the woman, who cried tears of happiness. “I love you so much.”

But James had no knowledge of this interaction. He was sitting in a café in Stockholm. Across from him sat Soraya, her smile igniting a fire in his heart that spread through his entire body. And he was happy.

It’s a treat to myself for staying at home with a newborn and 21 month old while my husband works busy season as a CPA 😆

I have always loved coffee, but lately (and especially while pregnant) drip coffee did not taste right to me. My SIL fixed me a latte with her Essenza and I loved it. So I immediately ordered one!

I typically prefer light roast coffees and ristretto shots in my lattes. I’m hoping to perfect the at-home latte for myself since we’ll be at home so much this winter! 


All of that to say… what supplies to you recommend I get? It comes with an Aeroccino Milk Frother. Torani syrups? Make my own syrup? Any specific capsules you think I should  try?

**Note:** Wrote this for another sub and thought I would share it here because fitness is likely on most people's minds right now. Pics and links are not allowed on this sub so all visual aides and tools have been removed from this post. That might be a tad confusing. Still, hope it helps some people out.

Most people reading this have likely tried several times to finally get the body they want, made some progress towards their goals, and then relapsed into old lifestyle habits and have slipped back to exactly where they were when they started, or are potentially in a worse spot then when they first started.  

Others will likely have suffered from a severe case of “Tomorrow Syndrome” where they constantly delay beginning because of the false belief that conditions need to be perfect for them to begin or it won’t be worth it. 

Some people have also fallen into a type of “Fitness Nihilism” where they believe they are simply cursed with the body they have and a lean and muscular physique is something that is never going to happen. 

If you are part of the first group, you need to come to terms with the fact that making a significant change in your physique takes time and it takes much longer if you are just walking into it blind. You will need to pursue sustainable fitness and make the right choices that actually have the potential to get you closer to your goals. 

If you are part of the second group, you need to come to terms with the fact that tomorrow will never come because there will never be a perfect time to start. You will always put off starting because something will always come up. Start now when things aren’t perfect, or you’re going to be in the same place or worse come next New Year. The best time to start was a year ago, the second-best time to start is today. There is no third-best time to start. 

If you are part of the third group, you should find comfort in the fact that the body is highly plastic in nature. We have a significant amount of power in shaping it into the way we want it to look and the limits of what that looks like are much more extreme than what you would expect. No matter what physical limitations you think the universe has cursed you with, you still have the ability to get a lean and muscular physique. 

But no matter what group you are a part of, this is the place for you.  

First, now is the time to start even if it is just some small changes. Second, you should find comfort in the fact that small changes have much larger impacts the longer they are implemented. You only need to get 1% better each day in order to see continuous progress. Also, you should find comfort in the fact that this article (or more realistically series of articles because it will probably get too long) will tell you exactly what you need to do in order to get a lean and muscular physique no matter what your starting point is. 

**Let’s talk about timelines.** 

Getting into awesome shape will likely take you between 6 and 18 months depending on how far you are from your goals. If all you need to do is lose 30-40 pounds, you’re looking at a relatively shorter timeline. If you need to lose 50 or more pounds of fat and/or gain 15-25 pounds of new muscle, you’re looking at a relatively longer timeline.  

You will need to have a clear picture of exactly how far you are from where you want to be and you’re going to need to be ok with the fact that you might find that as you get going that you are further away than you initially thought. 

My advice is, give yourself at least a year to get the body you want. You can make an extreme amount of progress in a year. 12-Week transformations are marketing scams. You can make a lot of progress in 12-Weeks but unless you are very close to your goals, you’re either going to pursue an unrealistic pace, rebound and be in a worse position, or you will fall short of the body you really want because you didn’t give yourself enough time. Fitness is a long-term game and not a short-term game. Prepare yourself for playing a long-term game. It can be a whole lot of fun if you do. If you can accept that and follow what this article says over the next year, you are going to get there, or you will at least be within striking distance. 

**But how do we figure out our personal timelines?** 

The first thing you will need to do is figure out where you currently are fitness-wise. Remember, a map only works if we know where we are and where we want to go. Here is what you will need to do: 

**1. Collect a Fasted Body Weight Measurement.** 

This should happen first thing in the morning, before eating, drinking, or showering, and ideally after you have used the restroom. You should take this measurement in the nude or at least in your underwear. This is the most accurate way to collect body weight and is how you should do it every time, and you should be doing it every day from here forward. 

You should get a digital body scale that is as precise as possible. 0.1 Pound or 0.05 Kilo increments is great. (I will have some links to some of the tools I like in the comments. I am not affiliated with any of these companies, and these are not affiliate links, just products I recommend to my clients.) You will need to complete your weigh-in on a flat and hard surface like concrete, hardwood, or tile. You cannot do this on carpet or any kind of uneven or soft surface or you will get an inaccurate reading. 

You will need to record this measurement. Do it as soon as you take it every morning before you go grab that first cup of coffee or hop in the shower. Trust me, you think you won’t forget but you will. I’m old school so I use a desk calendar to record all my weigh-ins that I just hang above my scale, but you could use something like the free version of the HappyScale app too. 

**2. Take Body Measurements.** 

You could take as many of these as you would like but there are only a few essential measurements. You should be taking all of these measurements in centimeters, and you should try and be precise down to the 10^(th) of a CM. A digital body tape makes this way easier. My favorite one will be down in the comments. 

**The essential measurements for men are:** 

* Neck Girth 
* Navel Girth 

**The essential measurements for women are:** 

* Neck Girth 
* Navel Girth 
* Hip/Glute Girth 
* Use the Pictures below to help you with your measurements. 

**The non-essential but helpful measurements are:** 

* Shoulder Girth 
* Chest Girth 
* Waist Girth (narrowest part of torso irrelevant to belly button) 
* Girth 2” Above Navel 
* Girth 2” Below Navel 
* Hip/Glute Girth (for men) 
* Both Upper Arm Girths 
* Both Forearm Girths 
* Both Thigh Girth 
* Both Calf Girths 

Don’t forget to also collect an accurate height measurement, no guessing. I will provide a link to how to do that on your own in the comments. 

**3. Take Progress Pictures** 

Progress pictures are an essential part of evaluating progress on any program. You should be trying to take the best progress photos possible, but what does best mean? It means that they should accurately convey your current physique, provide a comprehensive look at your physique, and should be taken in such a way that there are as few variables from progress pictures taken at the beginning of your timeline and at any other period of your timeline.  

You should not be trying to make yourself look better or worse than you look in person. That means no pushing out your stomach for your before photos and no flexing for your after photos. It means don’t change the light so you look washed out in your before photos and covered in helpful shadows in your after photos. 

They should be clear, taken in good light, and should show the body from the mid-calf to the top of the head. They should be taken from about waist level (just make sure it is the same every time) and the camera should not be tilted up or down. In order to do this you’re going to want to get some kind of cheap tripod and a phone camera shutter remote. I’ll have links to the ones I like in a comment. 

For our purposes we will be taking three pictures every time we take progress photos. The first picture will be from the front, the second picture will be from the side, and the third picture will be from the back. 

Here is an example of good progress pictures: 

You are also going to want to save all your progress photos in an organized way. To do this I like creating a folder in my phone and then creating a new folder for each week and label it with the day that I will take my progress photos. I take a new set and take new body measurements every week and recommend the same to all my clients. Here is an example of what I am talking about: 

I take all my progress photos and body measurements on Sunday mornings. You don’t need to take your photos on Sundays, but you should be taking them first thing in the morning after using the restroom but before eating drinking or taking a shower. You should also be taking them on the same day each week under the same conditions. I like to have clients build a routine of taking their progress photos and doing all their measurements before filling out the weekly check-ins they send me for our coaching, the only difference is that you will be doing this for yourself.  

**4. Calculate Your BF% and Lean Mass** 

Now that you have your body measurements and progress photos you are ready to calculate your body fat percentage and calculate your lean mass.  

Body Fat is simple, you’re just going to follow the “Body Fat Calculator” link in the comment below and it will take you to an online calculator. Put in the information it requires, some of which we have just taken, and write the number it gives you down. We are going to use these later to not only to calculate our lean mass and design our timeline but also to set our calories and macros. 

Once you have a body fat percentage simply multiply this by your current body weight to find your fat mass in pounds. To find your lean mass in pounds simply take your bodyweight and subtract your fat mass. 

**Example: (Male)** 

Body Fat %: 25% 

Body Weight: 200 lbs. 

Fat Mass: 50 lbs. 

Lean Mass: 150 lbs. 

Most men will need to get to between 8% and 12% body fat to truly be considered shredded. Women are going to have a bit more variance, partially because there is a larger discrepancy in female ideal body types as far as leanness is concerned, but most women will want to be somewhere between 16% and 22% depending on their preferences. This of course is affected by things like breast and butt augmentations.  

In our example, if lean mass stayed the same, this person would need to diet down to around 167 pounds to hit 10% body fat and that would mean dieting for around 17-18 weeks straight at a rate of 1% of body weight loss per week to reach these numbers. Check out this rate of loss chart to see what I mean: 

The problem is that lean mass won’t stay the same. A natural trainee should expect the composition of each pound of body weight lost to be close to 90% fat and 10% lean mass under ideal conditions, likely closer to 80% fat and 20% lean mass under favorable conditions. This ratio gets less and less favorable as conditions become less favorable. We will cover what favorable conditions looks like later in this series but for now let’s focus on “rate of loss.”  

The harder we diet, the more likely we are to lose lean mass during a dieting phase. Men can usually diet at a rate of 1-2% per week and women can usually safely diet at a rate of 0.5-1% per week. The leaner you get, the lower your weekly loss rate should be in order to maintain lean mass. The higher your current body fat, the more tolerance you have for quicker weight loss. Still, different people will experience different tolerances to dieting based of off a lot of individual factors. 

This isn’t as bad as it sounds though because lean mass doesn’t just mean muscle mass it means everything that isn’t fat. Lean mass is water, organs, skin, bones, and yes… muscle mass. 

But on the other end we also have to be aware of positive body recomposition in those who are hyper responders to training stimulus and those using HRT during their dieting phase. These people will very likely see lean mass increase during a dieting phase and their weight loss will not look as impressive as it actually is if we are simply using a scale to gauge progress. 

This inevitable change in lean mass as we diet is one of the reasons we test bodyfat every week. We don’t want to lose too much muscle mass as we diet because we are mostly concerned with body composition. We could lose fifty pounds but if 50% of that is lean mass, we aren’t going to look the way we want to look at the end of our diet even though we have reached our “goal” bodyweight. If we drop 10 pounds on the scale but our lean mass has increased by 5 pounds, we will actually have experienced 15 pounds of fat loss, and this will affect our diet going forward. 

Keep in mind that there are many factors that influence our daily weigh-ins even under ideal measurement conditions. How late we ate the night before, our hydration levels from the previous day, weather or not we are experiencing regular bowel movements, how much transient body water we are holding, what phase of your monthly cycle you are in… the list goes on and you will get better at recognizing these factors the more you complete daily weigh-ins.  

Also, we will be covering how to interpret daily weigh-ins during different phases of the menstrual cycle later on in this series. 

What we are really looking for is trends in daily weigh-ins. Generally, this is done on a weekly basis where all of our previous seven daily weigh ins are averaged together to find our weekly average weigh-in. This weekly weigh-in gives us a much more accurate representation of our current bodyweight than any single weigh-in could. 

This is why putting too much value on our current body weight, or any single body weight measurement, doesn’t make any sense. The same bodyweight can look very different even on the same person. Bodyweight is simply a datapoint, not a number that reflects our current fitness and it needs to be viewed in its proper context. It shouldn’t be feared or avoided. Body composition, and how we look in the mirror are the things we really need to be concerned about and in order to make sure we have favorable body composition and look the way we want to look at the end of our cutting phase, we need to track our daily body weights, take weekly body fat measurements, and take weekly progress photos. 

**But what does information mean to us from week to week? Why not just test bodyfat every few months?**  

Good question! 

If lean mass begins to go down too quickly, we slow down our rate of loss to preserve more lean mass. If we see lean mass rising, we know we are in a good place or we know we could even potentially increase our rate of loss. Generally, I like to only adjust the diet every four weeks of a program as long as things are going well. This is also when I look at the trends in lean mass to see if we need to increase protein intake and if we should increase or decrease our rate of loss. The reason I like to wait four weeks if possible is to help reduce diet fatigue from constantly changing macros and to have confirmation of any issue that might arise during a diet. One measurement that seems to indicate something is really not enough. What we are looking for is a trend in data. 

I’ll talk more about how we make these decisions later on in the series but for now all you need to know is that daily weigh-ins, body fat testing, and taking progress pictures are very important to long term success and ending up with the body we want to have. 

**But what does this mean as far as timelines go for the next year?** 

For the do-it-yourself approach let’s go simple. If you only need to lose between 15% and 20% of your body weight, you are pretty realistically looking at following the below timeline: 

This below timeline is two 12-week fat loss phases bridged by a 4-week maintenance phase and followed by an 8-week maintenance phase and then some time spent putting on a bit of lean muscle.  

If you have more than 20% of your body weight to lose you are more realistically looking at completing intervals of 12-weeks of fat loss and 4-week of maintenance until you reach your desired body composition. You could then follow that up with an 8-12-week maintenance phase and then move on to putting on some lean muscle. Your next year would look like this: 

Don’t forget, as we get closer to our goals, we can adjust our timelines, These are not rigid sets of rules but instead simple guidelines to help us get we want to go. 

**But wouldn’t this be a whole lot quicker if you skipped all the time spent at maintenance?** 

No, if we did that you would likely never reach your goals and if you did, you would likely just revert back to the body you had before. This is because of two main reasons. 

The first reason is diet fatigue and adherence. The longer we diet without a break, the more diet fatigue we build up and the more likely we are to cheat on our diet and then, if diet fatigue gets too great, quit the diet all together. It is very important to break up long dieting periods with periods of time spent at maintenance to let a good deal of this accrued diet fatigue resolve itself.  

The second reason is that our true level of fitness is the level of fitness we can realistically maintain. Maintaining any level of fitness requires a good deal of practice. The more we practice, the better we get at it. If we do this at intervals throughout our fat loss periods, we basically give ourselves check-points for our fitness. If we end up quitting our diet due to high diet fatigue part of the way through a fat loss phase, we have a level of maintenance we can fall back into to give ourselves a break and a fresh start without going all the way back to the beginning. Think about it like resetting our normal eating and lifestyle patterns every 12-weeks.  

This is one of the reasons why it is incredibly important to follow an extended maintenance phase following any series of fat loss phases. We obviously want to get in awesome shape, but we also want to be able to stay in shape once we are done with the tough part of the process. Most programs never account for staying in shape once the hard work has been done. 

Well, this part has gotten pretty long so I’m going to go ahead and wrap it up here. In the next part we will cover everything nutrition. I will go over setting your initial calories and macros, meal timing and frequency, as well as how to pick the eating routine that will work best for you and what kinds of foods can be helpful along the way. I’ll probably post that tomorrow or the next day but if you have any questions, just drop them below. 

Hope it helps. Until next time!

1hs55v7,https://i.redd.it/8tf0t05bgnae1.jpeg,20 years of sobriety. This is how I achieve it.,"Hello everyone in this wonderful thread!

By some mistake, my previous post ended up being focused only on the headline, so I decided to share a more detailed set of observations about sober living this time.

A bit of background: I’ve been completely sober for 20 years. That’s two decades without a single drop of alcohol. I can confidently say that choosing this path was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Sticking to it has been incredibly rewarding because having a clear mind at all times is an invaluable gift.

I’ll admit I was lucky, though. Unlike many others I’ve read about or spoken to, who often face significant challenges in their journey to sobriety, I didn’t struggle much. I never really had any particular cravings for substances or dependencies. So for me, it was a relatively easy decision to make, and my lifestyle simply aligned with it. But I do have some personal insights to share that helped me stay on this path.

I’m deeply immersed in tea culture—not just casually drinking tea but professionally engaging with it. Over the years, I’ve explored Chinese tea traditions, then Japanese, and other Asian cultures as well. I started incorporating ceremonial tea practices into my lifestyle, which I believe played a big role in maintaining my sobriety. Many people in my circle who are also passionate about tea don’t drink alcohol either.

Tea, in some ways, naturally replaced the ritual of drinking alcohol. When we talk about harmful habits or substance abuse, it’s often not just the substance itself but the ritual around it that makes it hard to quit. Whether it’s beer with friends while watching football, or certain foods paired with drinks, or even the routine of drinking itself—it’s all part of a social or personal ritual.

Tea, especially in the context of Chinese tea ceremonies or even something as simple as English tea traditions, offers a structured and fulfilling ritual of its own. This ritualization is powerful—it helps shift the focus from harmful habits to something meaningful and enriching.

For me, it happened to be tea, and I’ve shared this passion with others in my life, many of whom have also found tea to be transformative. I know hundreds of people who’ve replaced drinking alcohol with tea. You can see similar discussions in the tea community here on Reddit—feel free to check my recent posts, where many people have commented on this very topic and shared similar experiences.

Of course, tea isn’t the only option. For some, it might be coffee, sports, or other hobbies that provide structure and meaning. I believe finding an alternative ritual that resonates with you is key. For people with more serious dependencies, introducing a meaningful, fulfilling ritual can be far more effective than simply trying to quit without any replacement.

That’s my perspective, and I hope it resonates with someone!",16,1735853715.0,SoberLifeProTips,4,1.0,False

I only started having anxiety after the death of my great grandmother and seeing an open Casket for the first time in my life.

Was looking at DF64 Gen II, DF64v Gen II, Timemore 064s, or Timemore 078s. Within the next 2 years I am looking to upgrade my espresso machine to a prosumer device in the 1-2k range and would like the grinder I purchase now to work for that as well.

  
My thoughts:

DF64 Gen II -- Seems like the best value at $389 (stock burrs) or $410 (DLC burrs) but its seems unnecessarily large and ugly. I like the idea that the burrs can be easily changed though I doubt I'll be doing that anytime soon.  
DF64v Gen II -- Seems like pretty good value ($499) considering its a better build quality than regular 64, much sleeker, and has DLC burrs so we're only really talking $90 more for the build quality. Catch cup seems bad and RPM changing seems useless. Seems like some people have had issues with it though. I like the idea that the burrs can be easily changed though I doubt I'll be doing that anytime soon.  
Timemore 064s -- Pretty expensive ($579) for a grinder that has a bigger and better sibling though I know Lance and James both seem to like this one. Nearly pulled the trigger on it but what gives me pause is the availability of the 078s which may be better for when I upgrade the espresso machine + seems very hard to change the burrs down the line. But also I live in a NYC apartment so space does matter and its a great size. Its also pretty.  
Timemore 078s -- Very expensive ($779) and highly recommended. It could be a great 'end game' grinder assuming I never have to switch out the burrs. But its big and i'm not sold that 78mm is necessary or wanted for a home espresso setup especially considering the lack of availability and expense of third party burrs. I know Lance thinks these are some of the best burrs around though. However its also $300 more than the DF64v and nearly $400 more than DF64 Gen II which seems to perform about the same (?).

For context, I plan to use my 1zpresso JX Pro for filter brews so I am only concerned with espresso on the electric grinder. Hand grinding filter coffees is a breeze but espresso really is annoying... especially light roasts.",1,1735853293.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

So I downloaded the latest edition of the AnKing deck V12, looks great and is tagged with a lot of resources, then I found this deck: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/10jl0au/mnemosyne\_deck\_an\_anki\_deck\_based\_on\_first\_aid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/10jl0au/mnemosyne_deck_an_anki_deck_based_on_first_aid/) Which is fewer cards than AnKing but is only First Aid, and I bought the book for first Aid and I love how concise it is, and it can even help me summarise some learning taught by my Med School in the UK which is great! Now, idk which deck to use, I have plenty of time before i want to sit the USMLE maybe like 2 years or so, but I want to get started ASAP as I dont know about the future med workload and other things may pop up in the future. 

  
Now my question is do I use Mnemosyne or AnKing or BOTH? I.e. remove the FA tags from AnKing and use the rest of the deck?? 

  
Secondly, what resources do I use, i understand the practice question using UWorld and NBME and Free120 after finishing Anki and knowing the concepts thats all good, but with Anki what resource do I use, FA is a must but they said its not a learning tool more like a supplement, Ik people say Sketchy for the great animation and Pathoma for Pathology and Board and Beyond?? Not sure about that but how do I use those resources with AnKing if i choose to use it or Mnemosyne or Both decks if I choose? Do I read from all resources mentioned above then Unsuspend and do the cards? If so do i suspend them after doing them for a while? Ik you have to do reviews everyday but If i decide to use Anking or Anking + Msemysyne + My Med School decks I think the reviews will skyrocket but I do have the lesisure of time so I can pace myself but yeah general question is how do you use resources + Anki effecticvely regardless of the deck and if using the AnKing deck how to utilise it effectively. 

  
P.S. Ive seen some posts that AnKing V12 IS NOT updated to FA 2024 and some images and notes are missing and you need to download the extra bit? Any help as to what this is about?

1hs4vy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hs4vy1/for_the_total_price_of_a_breville_barista_touch/,"For the total price of a Breville Barista Touch, can you recommend a standalone grinder and machine with similar convenience features? [$1000]","Looking to buy an espresso machine, and--with hopes not to offend anyone here--am mostly looking for convenient, reasonably-high-quality coffee: not a new hobby. I also foresee myself and my partner making milk-heavy drinks far more often than drinking straight espresso.

Something like the **Breville Barista Touch** therefore sounds like the right idea on paper: it seems to have a glowing online consensus, and sits at just-about the upper end of my price range.

*But*, having discovered this sub and absorbed the general wisdom that:
 - The grinder is more important than the machine
 - It's better to buy standalone components and leave an upgrade path open

I started to have misgivings about buying an all-in-one machine.

Again: my short-term priority is convenience, but longer-term I *am* the sort that's liable to go down the rabbit hole to *some* extent. I went on a bit of a quality coffee kick back during the pandemic, upgrading from a $20-I-don't-care-what-it-is drip machine and storebought grounds to a **Timemore C2** and French press, which is still my primary means of making brew coffee.

Obviously that's a modest financial investment compared to an espresso setup, but this is all to say that I don't mind adding *some* cost and cutting *some* convenience, if it's the sort of thing that can make a difference to even my newbie tastebuds. Would rather keep it to the latter in this case, though, since we're already starting at $1000 USD.

So: with the BBT having set the baseline, I've been looking for a standalone grinder and machine which leave an upgrade path open but still capture most of the automated workflow. What I'm leaning toward now are the **Baratza Sette 270** and **Breville Bambino Plus**, which clock in at the same total MSRP as the BBT but have all the convenience features I see myself caring about:
 - Non-single-dose grinder with beans carafe
 - Automatic dosing with 3 programmable presets, which seems like plenty
 - Automatic milk frothing

I'm fairly confident that I'd be happy with this combo, but still have a couple hesitancies, like: even though I was going to spend $1000 on an all-in-one, there's a part of me that balks at buying a separate grinder for the primary purpose of ""upgradability,"" then starting with a $400 grinder.

Also: this is the *least* important of all my criteria, but my understanding is that the Sette is really only good for espresso, and it would nice to get a grinder that can also remove the hand-grinding step from my brew coffee workflow. But obviously, that's just gravy when the alternative is an espresso all-in-one.

He was very nice & said I was so beautiful, we got on really well in those short 3 minutes, he asked for my number and I gave it to him.

He texted me almost straight away to say he wanted to meet me and go for some coffee, but I unfortunately had to fly back home to England.

I visited Scotland again on the 30th December. He said he absolutely wanted to meet me. I met him and we had an amazing time. He kissed me at the end, on the lips and on my hand and asked me multiple times if I wanted to see him again, I said yes definitely.

After the date, he texted me to say ""enjoy your show"" with a smiley face, because I had booked to see a theatre show while I was there.

I flew back the next morning. It's now January 2nd and I haven't heard from him. I text him happy new year on new years and he reacted wit heart emoji, but nothing else.

Is he just trying to not be pushy? Do you think he will text me soon asking to meet again? Should I text him saying ""do you want to see each other again?"" or is that being desperate?

I did a 4 month treatment (this was my second round of accutane - the first one cleared my skin but acne started coming back after a couple of years) and while this second round made my skin better it’s definitely not the expected result from accutane. The longest I go without breaking out is a week and that’s only because I also don’t eat dairy sugar and coffee. When I eat those, I get new pimples almost every day. And the pimples are not always small, I also get cysts and pustules. 

When the 4 months was over I asked my doctor to keep me on for longer but he insisted that my skin is perfectly fine and I don’t need it and told me I can get a second opinion. Problem is in my country getting a derm referral takes 3 months. So when I saw the second derm he agreed that my round was too short but after 3 months we can no longer just continue the last course I’d have to start a third round. 

I decided to try spironolactone and see if that works before doing yet another round. I also started using adaplene again to at least maintain the improvements from the accutane, although I seem to be purging so I might stop bc I just can’t handle any more pimples (also I think it’s more proof my treatment was incomplete bc I shouldn’t have anything to purge after finishing accutane so recently). 

Anyways this is mostly a rant but if anyone has any advice please let me know. 

TLDR: my accutane treatment was too short and now I still have acne and feel discouraged. ",1,1735852605.0,SkincareAddiction,1,1.0,False

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who reads all of this because I know it’s lengthy. I’m really at the end of my rope in my relationship with my husband. I recently learned about OCPD and from my perspective, he checks pretty much all the boxes. 

I was hoping to provide a list of examples of things. He has done even in the recent months to get confirmation if so that he has this issue and also to ask how to deal with it. I don’t want to dissolve the marriage but I feel like he believes I can do no right and feels like the goalposts keep moving. I’m sorry to become an anxious wreck not knowing if my husband is going to blow up over some minor thing after having a perfectly good weekend for example. 

As an overview, he has on numerous occasions seriously stated that he believes he is perfect, constantly criticizes and scrutinizes not only myself, but others, even out in public or certain groups such as “all Americans are lazy “ (he’s from another country) he has obsessive perfectionistic views for things being clean around the house. He will follow me around with a piece of lettuce that went moldy in the back of the fridge that I didn’t notice and criticize me or take a fork out of the dishwasher that didn’t get cleaned properly and complain to me that I didn’t rinse it right he seems to notice things that others don’t also counters are never cleaned enough. I do not wipe them down enough for example. I am constantly being called a slob, and that things are not up to his standards. He will ruin perfect holidays or days out over the smallest things not being up to his standards. Here are some examples:

1) food must always be “hot food, hot or cold food cold’ he will drive people crazy about this making food so hot it burn ones mouth. Last year on New Year’s Eve , he was not feeling well, and he asked me to make him a bowl of soup. The soup was literally steaming and boiling when I handed it to him apparently, when it reached him, it was not hot enough. He got up in a rage and got hysterical that I fed him “cold “soup what kind of a wife does that and that he cannot rely on me life if you ever got sick. Turned into him telling me “he knows what he has to do. “find someone who will take good care of him and that no problem “I’ll find somewhere else to live I’m done with you.’ 

2) Overblown reactions to something as simple as like I stated before and herb that looks like it’s starting to go bad in the fridge. He will chastise me for this and tell me that I’m a slob and I don’t take care of my fridge or he will find a fork. It wasn’t clean properly put it in my face leave it like he shaming a dog to say look here you didn’t do this right or literally follow me around and mention it to me.

3) test me with weird tests: For example, he will leave his plate out and expect me to pick it up for him even though he went in and out of the room several times then he will finally come in and take the plate and then Huff N Puff and shake his head at me to watch when I say what’s the problem and he sarcastically says nothing. Yet I thought I was the slob and he’s perfectly neat?

4) very hypocritical with his standards such that his office is a complete pigsty along with his side of the sink and his nightstand. Yet he finds the most obscure things to pick up me for that I did not do around the house that was giving him “major stress “and then I am a hoarder and have major clutter everywhere but he does not mind his own clutter?

5) has weird obsessions with things like that you must clean out the kitchen fridge take everything out at least once a week and wash and soap down all the drawers the cabinets everything even if nothing is dirty he tells me it’s normal to do so everyone I speak to tells me this is not normal. 

Also will obsess over one minor thing then brag about it like there will be a mess in the kitchen that he left stuff where it doesn’t go. He will ignore all of that but he will wipe down the counters and then bring it up to me that quote.I just spent 20 minutes wiping down.YOUR counters’. I tell him, but didn’t dawn on you to put these dishes in the sink, for example?
  
Its always ‘I cleaned YOUR fridge YOUR counters very punitive always feels like he is shaming me for not taking care of the house properly. As a sidenote, I’ve asked many people honestly, they say your house is beautiful. There’s a slight amount of clutter, but nothing major at all, and that he has no reason whatsoever to get as angry as he does.

6) complains that there are cat toys out. We have a cat and at any given time I might have a ball and a mouse for example, in the living room for him to play with you can’t exactly put them away when they’re done because cats play with these things he gets hysterical over this and complains that it’s like we have kids as he says thank God we did not have kids because he would never allow them to have a toy out of places. 

7) Everything has to be just so has he expects he will throw into a rage because I didn’t have a bowl handy and I told him let’s just eat the chips out of the bag for example that is not the “right “way or god forbid I give him a slightly smaller salad fork to eat with bc we’re out of utensils he gets very angry. Also if I put something on ‘his placemat’ even for a minute and he notices it while I’m cleaning or moving things around, he gets upset about that somehow offend him. He ruined an entire night once because I was folding laundry and left the folding laundry in the hamper next to his chair. He put it on top of my chair and said why can’t stay on your chair it was literally just in motion, moving its way up the stairs.  

I have several other examples I’d like to mention if anyone’s kind enough to respond. The overall theme here is that anything will upset his ego or authority everything offends him. Everything must be done exactly his way, and he’s extremely judgmental and critical of others, even though he was very very far from perfect himself yet he will say he is perfect I point out that he’s hypocritical because he has massive messes in his personal space and he tells me, but I make a mess of the whole house. I explain to him the whole house is my responsibility. You just have a desk to take care of and you’re still a slob. He leaves his socks on the couch for three weeks until he finds the “right ones “in the laundry.  To me, that’s messy and sloppy. Why not bring your socks off and put them in the drawer until you find them. The list goes on.

He’s on and off threatening divorce because of the way “we live like slobs “I ask him to show me exactly what he thinks is a mess and it’s completely insane every day things oh look at this coffee out over here yes, near the coffee maker where it’s used every day. For example, it’s like his eye catches  things that no one else’s would find to be abnormal. It is as if  he wants to live in a show house with everything put away and I’m sorry, but life is not like that there’s nothing wrong with being a little lived in. It’s just he and I and a cat. He refuses to let me get a dog bc ‘they’re too dirty’. I grew up with dogs. My entire life in our home was never dirty, but to him they slobber too much and they stink, and they will stink up the house. My whole life is pretty much revolving around his standards of cleanliness and organization, and I really can’t take it anymore. He’s constantly calling me lazy and a slob and micromanages me asking me ‘what I did all day’ (I’m currently not working) or even ‘what did you do for the house in the past 20 mins while he was doing whatever’. It’s suffocating! please any feedback would be helpful!",2,1735852588.0,LovedByOCPD,4,1.0,False
1hs4ol4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Echerdex/comments/1hs4ol4/my_journey_with_zacatechichi_mexican_lucid_dream/,My journey with Zacatechichi (Mexican Lucid Dream Herb),"I wish to document my personal journey trying out this herb in this subreddit. So I'll start with a little bit of my background.

I have been heavily into psychology and philosophy for at least 10 years now (I'm 26, male), and I've recently gotten more into Jung's work and Freudian Dream Analysis.

I've also recently gotten into Hermeticism and meditation, I've found that these 2 have helped me achieve a better mental state lately but I've always wanted to explore my subconcsious mind more, I've attended Freudian / Lacanian psychoanalyst therapy.

All this just so you guys get to know me a bit more, I'm truly no expert at all but it's just a background of my interests.

My personal goal with the Zacatechichi journey is trying to achieve Lucid Dreaming and using it to explore my subconcsious mind, since I do believe, the Oneiric world hides very interesting knowledge.

First off, this is how I approach my own dreaming ritual, if there's any recommendations, I will gladly take them into account.

1.- Set the mood / clean the room with incense and open the windows to let the cold in, I want a cold room temperature to achieve better sleeping.

2.- Proceed to spend the next 30 minutes meditating to tibetan bowls, mostly my favorite 528 Hz.

3.- Interrupt my meditation to brew the Zacatechichi tea.

4.- Meditate for abouit 15 more minutes while taking sips from the tea.

5.- Once the incense is off, close the windows, turn off the lights, make it as dark as possible (helps that my room is pretty dark), and lately I've found that when I sleep on a high pillow such as this one ([▷ Almohada Antireflujo Sognare Trucomfort | Hasta 12 MSI y Envío Gratis](https://sognare.com.mx/almohadas-especializadas/trucomfort)) I have much higher chances of dreaming, or at least, remembering it, and also they become, deeper, longer dreams.

6.- While I have my eyes closed and I'm preparing to sleep I keep repeating phrases like ""you're dreaming"" to myself in my mind, and imagine myself in a liminal space, like a train station or airport, to give myself the thought of, going through a gateway.

  
This was Day 1 of Zacatechichi Journey:

I made a VERY strong tea, I completely underestimated how bitter the flavor would be, although Zacatechichi literally means ""bitter grass"", I tried to drink it but it was far too stron, to the point it almost provoked a vomit reaction.

So I drank as much as I could and then went to sleep. The bitterness was so strong I feel it even might've made me take longer to fall asleep, but finally I did sleep, and this is what I dreamt.

I did not experience any lucidity yet, but I do feel like in my dreams I was perceiving everything from a first person perspective, which is a little bit odd in my usual dreaming, I usually dream inbetween takes of third person and first person.

I did not experience one long dream, but many short ones, I could not remember them all when I woke up but the ones I remembered most were 3 in this order:

  
1st dream:   
I was stuck in a kindergarten that actually looked more like the university I went to, all I could think about in this dream was of getting out, I was scared of staying inside the institution for some reason and there were teachers looking for me, but even when I was scared, the teachers posed no threat at all, I easily got out by jumping over a fence on a side of the building that I used to hang around, and I got out and without thinking about it, started walking towards my home.  


2nd dream:   
This was a shorter dream, and it was a reunion with people I used to hang with in university, mostly people that I met due to a WorldMUN group we had, we were meeting in some random parking lot, they were all arriving in groups, in different cars, and there I was standing with my GF by my side and we would hugh each and everyone of them when we met them, it's a little bit weird because normally we wouldn't have hugged all of them, cus it was some intense hugging, not just a way to say hello, as if we all had been insanely missing each other. And I didn't want to think about this because I felt guilty about it. but one girl I used to like in that MUN group was there too, and she gave me the strongest hug out of all of them.

  
3rd dream:  
In this dream I was driving my way to my work (I own a little coffee shop / bakery), but the weather was unusually cold as if there was a storm coming, and I could only see everything in black and white, I got up to a traffic light that is just 1 block away from my work and there were some police officers parked there with their sirens on, I couldn't see any strange thing happening but they were there, looking like they'd been investigating something. I lowered my car's window to try to talk to them but as soon as I did, I realized everything outside my car was in color, regular, bright morning colors, and I was just stunned, I didn't know what to say, couldn't even talk to the officers, then I finally woke up.

  
If any of ya'll would like to interpret my dreams, that would be awesome, I'm going to be working on trying to achieve the Lucid dreaming, that is what the herb is supposedly for, and I didn't achieve lucidity but I did experience, MORE dreams and from an unusual perspective compared to most of my herbless dreams.

I will not be performing this personal ritual this night, I will take tonight as a break since I don't want to ""overdo"" it, but I will try to perform it tomorrow night and if not, I'll post once I've done it.

That is all, have a happy new year.",1,1735852536.0,Echerdex,0,1.0,False
1hs4og9,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hs4og9/the_little_things_very_much_matter_dont_sacrifice/,"The little things VERY MUCH matter, don't sacrifice some systems of your life at the expense of the other. (how I got out of an intense burnout)","Here is some advice from someone who got out of an intense burnout. Instead of trying to force fix your biggest problems, start from the small things that you may have neglected. I found Maslow's hierarchy of needs to offer a good visual in terms of your base. You can visualize it as if it were a triangular hierarchy, where your physiological needs exemplify your base.

The five levels of the hierarchy are: 

* **Physiological**: The most basic needs, such as food, water, shelter, and sleep.
* **Safety**: The need for security, stability, and freedom from fear
* **Love and belonging**: The need for interpersonal relationships, friendship, intimacy, and acceptance
* **Esteem**: The need for self-worth, accomplishment, and respect
* **Self-actualization**: The need to achieve one's full potential and creativity

This is quite simplified by the way there are likely more components you can add per each level. I often see lots of people trying to perfect their ego-wants while ignoring their lowest needs.

First, it is important to note that our body and anatomy are not made to care about our wants or ego-based ambitions. Our body simply wants to stay alive, be healthy, and be stable. Without achieving these innate needs that are held by our body, you can't make it enact your higher ambitious wants.

**Working out and diet**

If you are ever getting to a point where you are forgetting to eat, or perhaps you are eating too much, you are neglecting working out, just to better work on your ambitions then you are setting yourself up for intense failure. Speaking from experience as someone who was ""forgetting"" to eat anything throughout the whole day and so.

Interestingly, research finds that some of the highest-achieving people tend to work out more. I am not here to conflate a correlation relationship to that of a causation but, really, working out is meant to go alongside one's incentives, not to replace them.

[Here is a study showing that wealthier people exercise significantly more than the non-rich](https://richhabits.net/successful-wealthy-people-jog-more-than-the-non-rich/).

**Stress, anxiety, and productivity**

Stress and productivity have an inversely proportional kind of relationship. By stress, I don't mean the simple adrenaline rush you get on a Monday before the exam. By stress, I am talking about the full-on nerve-wracking, anxiety-provoking, sensation you constantly get, hindering you from doing anything you may need to.

Stress is a bodily indicator that something is wrong. By wrong, it could mean many things, even that you may not be aware of. For example, maybe you are not attending to something important, maybe you have bad time management, or maybe there are unresolved problems that you may be forgetting to attend to. It is very important to tackle the root cause of evoking these feelings. It is also important to note that everything in your system is connected, ranging from love life to physiological needs, and then to your psychological.

**Bad ways to deal with stress?**

* Resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as addictions
* Ignoring your responsibilities
* Sacrificing your other physiological or psychological needs to get a sense of coping.
* Letting it take you over, could manifest as workaholism or illogically spending too much time engaging in things that are unresolved at the expense of your other systems.

**Good ways to deal with stress/anxiety**

* Working on your lower level needs such as physiological or other psychological needs, manifesting as improving diet, and working out.
* Mindful exercises can happen through meditation.
* A very cold shower; works in making sure that the stress you are dealing with doesn't prevade you.
* Control your emotions, don't let them control you.
* Reduce coffee or stimulant-related drugs.
* Find the root cause, causing your stress, is there something you are neglecting? How is your life? Do you have a responsibility to attend to? Are you engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms?

**Sleep**

This too is unfairly neglected, I believe that sleep is quite very important in gaining stability in life. The lowest points of my life are heavily correlated to a lack of sleep, again this is not to make a correlation-causation relationship but to give you an idea of its importance.

Research shows that sleep is very much known to improve dopamine production, cognitive functions, emotional stability, and discipline. If you are compromising your sleep significantly to attend to your other systems, this will inevitably lead to an unstable sense of self-regulation.

**Small things that helped me (personally)**

* Engaging in spirituality, even in an atheistic form
* Very cold morning showers
* Cleaning and organizing my room every day
* A consistent walk in nature or parks
* Very immaculate personal hygiene-to be fair, I always had great hygiene but the perfection really aids your confidence and self-care.
* Running everyday
* A consistently clean diet with no sweets or junk
* Being less quick to anger or less quick to let my anxiety take over me.

**Visualization of an upside down triangle-a flipping the Maslow's hierarchy of needs**

To have a stable base, in terms of having your psychological or physiological needs met, means to be able to have a more consistent set of self-discipline, a more stable incentive, and a more stable goal. Compromising your basic needs for your wants would lead to an upside-down triangle, inevitably falling. A triangle cannot stand on the base of its tip, attempting that would lead to a broken system, which could manifest as burnout, urging you to start from the bottom, hope this helped.

*Discipline is not working too hard, or too little. Discipline is prevailing your emotions and distractors in an attempt to enact your will. I will be doing a form of dopamine detox over the next week and maybe report how it aided me.*",1,1735852527.0,self,0,1.0,False

- Richmond Station. We did their in-home Valentine's Day meal which was pretty good and then visited in person for the chefs menu for my birthday. The food was great and the service phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed the wine pairing which was as informative as it was delicious. Shout out to their super cool sommelier (I want to be her when I 'grow up') and the head chef who stopped by to answer a question.



- The Wood Owl. Visited twice, once for my husband's birthday and the other time when we had foodie family in town. We had such a great time both times. The service is chill but attentive. The food and wine are divine.



- Pomarosa. We ate here many many times this year. The arepas are gigantic and messy to eat but worth all the napkins. The black beans here are bomb.



- White Lily Diner. I've wanted to go here for ages and we finally had a day free to go. And you do kinda need the whole day: we put our name on the digital wait-list at 9 am (maybe earlier?) and weren't seated until 2 pm. Food was really good, I liked their biscuits, and pimento cheese.



- The Wren. Chill, unpretentious, and they now serve coffee. If you see their po'boy dinner special you must go. Fries/frites are to die for.


I'm curious what restaurants made your 2024 memorable!

Goes mass twice a month, but it very religious doing online mass at home and praying . She hasn't spoken to another catholic IRL  in 5 years

My other friend is also single , just goes to mass then leaves since her parish only has mom's group and old people groups. She hasn't spoken to any other catholic IRL in 3 years 

they do talk on the phone or Internet to other catholic sometimes . 

I was wondering if this is normal for single unmarried catholics over the age of 35?

It seemed wild to me but they thought it was normal or common for average middle age single catholic not to speak to any others in years

But then I realised that many parishes are very elderly, some are geared to families only who do mass then leave, with a couple old folk doing tea coffee and rosary group. Many parishes have a 18-30 youth group, a moms group and old folk ministries but nothing for single people age 35-60. so that's why my friends feel awkward and isolated 

even worse , they said they think it's actually common for single catholics of a middle age to go years without speaking to any other catholics

My girlfriend puts no effort into our relationship and quite frankly it’s boring me. She says to expect things will be different now that she recently settled from moving in with me because “real life” set in, she’s tired from work, and I don’t show her enough small gestures of physical affection in the day. I show her physical affection but she will tease all day knowing she is going to reject me so I told her I keep it to a minimum so that I’m not left feeling a way anymore. She also told me I have to do these things in the day otherwise she just won’t feel like it. I keep myself up, keep things exciting etc., and she never has to ask twice whenever she decides to. She doesn’t do any of this in return. With that, I asked “so if that’s your role, to be the one that initiates the daily small affections while I do everything else that’s too much?” She said yes, she’s tired of it. Sounds like she’s just not that interested in me and it’s affecting my self esteem now.

The routine is boring. She gets off at 2 pm and naps until 5:30/6 pm. By then, I’m just getting off work to grocery shop, clean and cook if i’m not working my second job. Keep in mind, even after all of this I’m still down for anything (going out, intimate time, movie night..I almost always have boundless energy lol.)The rest of her evening is mindlessly scrolling her phone, eating dinner and then going back to sleep. But, if I’m too tired to cook, she’s fine with just staying in bed and we both won’t eat. Or, she grabbed herself food before leaving work and I’ll figure it out for myself that night. I’ve had to beg her to show consideration to me as a girlfriend ie: random flowers, maybe treat me to my daily coffee, a card — things like that. I do the driving because she has no car/license so these specifically are things she can do given there’s a café and cheap flowers at her job. She made gestures for a week then stopped. At this point, I buy myself flowers (word to Miley). She complains about her share of bills after she asked me to let her take it on. My electric bill was $300 this month because she puts the heat on 90 F regardless of what I say or me turning it down. After asking for half, she reminded me that I forgot to pay her $30 back for our NYE date night uber. NYE was a nightmare as it was. She loves to say she spoils me, but does it sound like it?

My girlfriend constantly asks me when i’m going to marry her and have children together but behaviors like this just don’t feel representative of a balanced partnership to me. With this routine, it feels like I am not a girlfriend but her mother or FWB roommate. 

TLDR: My girlfriend doesn’t do things to make me feel special and I don’t feel taken care of despite how many times I tell her exactly what I expect. What things could I do on my part to inspire her to put in more effort and does it sound like I’m not seen as a girlfriend anymore?  ",1,1735852165.0,LesbianActually,9,1.0,False

1hs4hd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FatLossGuide/comments/1hs4hd7/new_year_new_you_a_roadmap_to_finally_getting_the/,"New Year, New You: A Roadmap to Finally Getting the Body You Want - Part One","Hello All, 

Most people reading this have likely tried several times to finally get the body they want, made some progress towards their goals, and then relapsed into old lifestyle habits and have slipped back to exactly where they were when they started, or are potentially in a worse spot then when they first started.  

Others will likely have suffered from a severe case of “Tomorrow Syndrome” where they constantly delay beginning because of the false belief that conditions need to be perfect for them to begin or it won’t be worth it. 

Some people have also fallen into a type of “Fitness Nhilism” where they believe they are simply cursed with the body they have and a lean and muscular physique is something that is never going to happen. 

If you are part of the first group, you need to come to terms with the fact that making a significant change in your physique takes time and it takes much longer if you are just walking into it blind. You will need to pursue sustainable fitness and make the right choices that actually have the potential to get you closer to your goals. 

If you are part of the second group, you need to come to terms with the fact that tomorrow will never come because there will never be a perfect time to start. You will always put off starting because something will always come up. Start now when things aren’t perfect, or you’re going to be in the same place or worse come next New Year. The best time to start was a year ago, the second-best time to start is today. There is no third-best time to start. 

If you are part of the third group, you should find comfort in the fact that the body is highly plastic in nature. We have a significant amount of power in shaping it into the way we want it to look and the limits of what that looks like are much more extreme than what you would expect. No matter what physical limitations you think the universe has cursed you with, you still have the ability to get a lean and muscular physique. 

But no matter what group you are a part of, this is the place for you.  

First, now is the time to start even if it is just some small changes. Second, you should find comfort in the fact that small changes have much larger impacts the longer they are implemented. You only need to get 1% better each day in order to see continuous progress. Also, you should find comfort in the fact that this article (or more realistically series of articles because it will probably get too long) will tell you exactly what you need to do in order to get a lean and muscular physique no matter what your starting point is. 

**Let’s talk about timelines.** 

Getting into awesome shape will likely take you between 6 and 18 months depending on how far you are from your goals. If all you need to do is lose 30-40 pounds, you’re looking at a relatively shorter timeline. If you need to lose 50 or more pounds of fat and/or gain 15-25 pounds of new muscle, you’re looking at a relatively longer timeline.  

You will need to have a clear picture of exactly how far you are from where you want to be and you’re going to need to be ok with the fact that you might find that as you get going that you are further away than you initially thought. 

My advice is, give yourself at least a year to get the body you want. You can make an extreme amount of progress in a year. 12-Week transformations are marketing scams. You can make a lot of progress in 12-Weeks but unless you are very close to your goals, you’re either going to pursue an unrealistic pace, rebound and be in a worse position, or you will fall short of the body you really want because you didn’t give yourself enough time. Fitness is a long-term game and not a short-term game. Prepare yourself for playing a long-term game. It can be a whole lot of fun if you do. If you can accept that and follow what this article says over the next year, you are going to get there, or you will at least be within striking distance. 

**But how do we figure out our personal timelines?** 

The first thing you will need to do is figure out where you currently are fitness-wise. Remember, a map only works if we know where we are and where we want to go. Here is what you will need to do: 

**1. Collect a Fasted Body Weight Measurement.** 

This should happen first thing in the morning, before eating, drinking, or showering, and ideally after you have used the restroom. You should take this measurement in the nude or at least in your underwear. This is the most accurate way to collect body weight and is how you should do it every time, and you should be doing it every day from here forward. 

You should get a digital body scale that is as precise as possible. 0.1 Pound or 0.05 Kilo increments is great. (I will have some links to some of the tools I like in the comments. I am not affiliated with any of these companies, and these are not affiliate links, just products I recommend to my clients.) You will need to complete your weigh-in on a flat and hard surface like concrete, hardwood, or tile. You cannot do this on carpet or any kind of uneven or soft surface or you will get an inaccurate reading. 

[Old School](https://preview.redd.it/0w77wk4fanae1.jpg?width=192&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=618ea85a91711e2142f0da1a277203f1567a005c)

You will need to record this measurement. Do it as soon as you take it every morning before you go grab that first cup of coffee or hop in the shower. Trust me, you think you won’t forget but you will. I’m old school so I use a desk calendar to record all my weigh-ins that I just hang above my scale, but you could use something like the free version of the HappyScale app too. 

**2. Take Body Measurements.** 

You could take as many of these as you would like but there are only a few essential measurements. You should be taking all of these measurements in centimeters, and you should try and be precise down to the 10^(th) of a CM. A digital body tape makes this way easier. My favorite one will be down in the comments. 

**The essential measurements for men are:** 

* Neck Girth 
* Navel Girth 

**The essential measurements for women are:** 

* Neck Girth 
* Navel Girth 
* Hip/Glute Girth 

Use the Pictures below to help you with your measurements. 

**The non-essential but helpful measurements are:** 

* Shoulder Girth 
* Chest Girth 
* Waist Girth (narrowest part of torso irrelevant to belly button) 
* Girth 2” Above Navel 
* Girth 2” Below Navel 
* Hip/Glute Girth (for men) 
* Both Upper Arm Girths 
* Both Forearm Girths 
* Both Thigh Girth 
* Both Calf Girths

Don’t forget to also collect an accurate height measurement, no guessing. I will provide a link to how to do that on your own in the comments. 

**3. Take Progress Pictures** 

Progress pictures are an essential part of evaluating progress on any program. You should be trying to take the best progress photos possible, but what does best mean? It means that they should accurately convey your current physique, provide a comprehensive look at your physique, and should be taken in such a way that there are as few variables from progress pictures taken at the beginning of your timeline and at any other period of your timeline.  

You should not be trying to make yourself look better or worse than you look in person. That means no pushing out your stomach for your before photos and no flexing for your after photos. It means don’t change the light so you look washed out in your before photos and covered in helpful shadows in your after photos. 

They should be clear, taken in good light, and should show the body from the mid-calf to the top of the head. They should be taken from about waist level (just make sure it is the same every time) and the camera should not be tilted up or down. In order to do this you’re going to want to get some kind of cheap tripod and a phone camera shutter remote. I’ll have links to the ones I like in a comment. 

For our purposes we will be taking three pictures every time we take progress photos. The first picture will be from the front, the second picture will be from the side, and the third picture will be from the back. 

Here is an example of good progress pictures: 

[High Quality Progress Pictures](https://preview.redd.it/32h5url8anae1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=00fad0fe4cd4576aa0c65ed6ed6223c98daa5322)

You are also going to want to save all your progress photos in an organized way. To do this I like creating a folder in my phone and then creating a new folder for each week and label it with the day that I will take my progress photos. I take a new set and take new body measurements every week and recommend the same to all my clients. Here is an example of what I am talking about: 

[Folder Set-Up](https://preview.redd.it/r2esfgzianae1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=9278f39e0838cd38729ceecd28ce0646a0fb9548)

I take all my progress photos and body measurements on Sunday mornings. You don’t need to take your photos on Sundays, but you should be taking them first thing in the morning after using the restroom but before eating drinking or taking a shower. You should also be taking them on the same day each week under the same conditions. I like to have clients build a routine of taking their progress photos and doing all their measurements before filling out the weekly check-ins they send me for our coaching, the only difference is that you will be doing this for yourself.  

**4. Calculate Your BF% and Lean Mass** 

Now that you have your body measurements and progress photos you are ready to calculate your body fat percentage and calculate your lean mass.  

Bodyfat is simple, you’re just going to follow the “Body Fat Calculator” link in the comment below and it will take you to an online calculator. Put in the information it requires, some of which we have just taken, and write the number it gives you down. We are going to use these later to not only to calculate our lean mass and design our timeline but also to set our calories and macros. 

Once you have a body fat percentage simply multiply this by your current body weight to find your fat mass in pounds. To find your lean mass in pounds simply take your bodyweight and subtract your fat mass. 

**Example: (Male)** 

* Body Fat %: 25% 
* Body Weight: 200 lbs. 
* Fat Mass: 50 lbs. 
* Lean Mass: 150 lbs. 

Most men will need to get to between 8% and 12% body fat to truly be considered shredded. Women are going to have a bit more variance, partially because there is a larger discrepancy in female ideal body types as far as leanness is concerned, but most women will want to be somewhere between 16% and 22% depending on their preferences. This of course is affected by things like breast and butt augmentations.  

In our example, if lean mass stayed the same, this person would need to diet down to around 167 pounds to hit 10% body fat and that would mean dieting for around 17-18 weeks straight at a rate of 1% of body weight loss per week to reach these numbers. Check out this rate of loss chart to see what I mean: 

[Weekly Rate of Loss of 1&#37; of BW\/Week](https://preview.redd.it/40hdh3r1bnae1.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4629d68c8a2b87794d2343046a3a319a18baf59)

The problem is that lean mass won’t stay the same. A natural trainee should expect the composition of each pound of body wight lost to be close to 90% fat and 10% lean mass under ideal conditions, likely closer to 80% fat and 20% lean mass under favorable conditions. This ratio gets less and less favorable as conditions become less favorable. We will cover what favorable conditions looks like later in this series but for now let’s focus on “rate of loss.”  

The harder we diet, the more likely we are to lose lean mass during a dieting phase. Men can usually diet at a rate of 1-2% per week and women can usually safely diet at a rate of 0.5-1% per week. The leaner you get, the lower your weekly loss rate should be in order to maintain lean mass. The higher your current body fat, the more tolerance you have for quicker weight loss. Still, different people will experience different tolerances to dieting based of off a lot of individual factors. 

This isn’t as bad as it sounds though because lean mass doesn’t just mean muscle mass it means everything that isn’t fat. Lean mass is water, organs, skin, bones, and yes… muscle mass. 

But on the other end we also have to be aware of positive body recomposition in those who are hyper responders to training stimulus and those using HRT during their dieting phase. These people will very likely see lean mass increase during a dieting phase and their weight loss will not look as impressive as it actually is if we are simply using a scale to gauge progress. 

This inevitable change in lean mass as we diet is one of the reasons we test bodyfat every week. We don’t want to lose too much muscle mass as we diet because we are mostly concerned with body composition. We could lose fifty pounds but if 50% of that is lean mass, we aren’t going to look the way we want to look at the end of our diet even though we have reached our “goal” bodyweight. If we drop 10 pounds on the scale but our lean mass has increased by 5 pounds, we will actually have experienced 15 pounds of fat loss, and this will affect our diet going forward. 

Keep in mind that there are many factors that influence our daily weigh-ins even under ideal measurement conditions. How late we ate the night before, our hydration levels from the previous day, weather or not we are experiencing regular bowel movements, how much transient body water we are holding, what phase of your monthly cycle you are in… the list goes on and you will get better at recognizing these factors the more you complete daily weigh-ins.  

Also, we will be covering how to interpret daily weigh-ins during different phases of the menstrual cycle later on in this series. 

What we are really looking for is trends in daily weigh-ins. Generally, this is done on a weekly basis where all of our previous seven daily weigh ins are averaged together to find our weekly average weigh-in. This weekly weigh-in gives us a much more accurate representation of our current bodyweight than any single weigh-in could. 

This is why putting too much value on our current body weight, or any single body weight measurement, doesn’t make any sense. The same bodyweight can look very different even on the same person. Bodyweight is simply a datapoint, not a number that reflects our current fitness and it needs to be viewed in its proper context. It shouldn’t be feared or avoided. Body composition, and how we look in the mirror are the things we really need to be concerned about and in order to make sure we have favorable body composition and look the way we want to look at the end of our cutting phase, we need to track our daily bodyweights, take weekly body fat measurements, and take weekly progress photos. 

**But what does information mean to us from week to week? Why not just test body fat every few months?**  

Good question! 

If lean mass begins to go down too quickly, we slow down our rate of loss to preserve more lean mass. If we see lean mass rising, we know we are in a good place or we know we could even potentially increase our rate of loss. Generally, I like to only adjust the diet every four weeks of a program as long as things are going well. This is also when I look at the trends in lean mass to see if we need to increase protein intake and if we should increase or decrease our rate of loss. The reason I like to wait four weeks if possible is to help reduce diet fatigue from constantly changing macros and to have confirmation of any issue that might arise during a diet. One measurement that seems to indicate something is really not enough. What we are looking for is a trend in data. 

I’ll talk more about how we make these decisions later on in the series but for now all you need to know is that daily weigh-ins, bodyfat testing, and taking progress pictures are very important to long term success and ending up with the body we want to have. 

**But what does this mean as far as timelines go for the next year?** 

For the do-it-yourself approach let’s go simple. If you only need to lose between 15% and 20% of your body weight, you are pretty realistically looking at following the below timeline: 

[Program Timeline A](https://preview.redd.it/zggthurranae1.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd8afa3da19754aa7249e6f0ed985810853a79d)

This below timeline is two 12-week fat loss phases bridged by a 4-week maintenance phase and followed by an 8-week maintenance phase and then some time spent putting on a bit of lean muscle.  

If you have more than 20% of your body weight to lose you are more realistically looking at completing intervals of 12-weeks of fat loss and 4-week of maintenance until you reach your desired body composition. You could then follow that up with an 8-12-week maintenance phase and then move on to putting on some lean muscle. Your next year would look like this: 

[Program Timeline B](https://preview.redd.it/nbv171svanae1.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe63f3d8ee043f124a0361a839c5c142c1669685)

Don’t forget, as we get closer to our goals, we can adjust our timelines, These are not rigid sets of rules but instead simple guidelines to help us get we want to go. 

**But wouldn’t this be a whole lot quicker if you skipped all the time spent at maintenance?** 

No, if we did that you would likely never reach your goals and if you did, you would likely just revert back to the body you had before. This is because of two main reasons. 

The first reason is diet fatigue and adherence. The longer we diet without a break, the more diet fatigue we build up and the more likely we are to cheat on our diet and then, if diet fatigue gets too great, quit the diet all together. It is very important to break up long dieting periods with periods of time spent at maintenance to let a good deal of this accrued diet fatigue resolve itself.  

The second reason is that our true level of fitness is the level of fitness we can realistically maintain. Maintaining any level of fitness requires a good deal of practice. The more we practice, the better we get at it. If we do this at intervals throughout our fat loss periods, we basically give ourselves check-points for our fitness. If we end up quitting our diet due to high diet fatigue part of the way through a fat loss phase, we have a level of maintenance we can fall back into to give ourselves a break and a fresh start without going all the way back to the beginning. Think about it like resetting our normal eating and lifestyle patterns every 12-weeks.  

This is one of the reasons why it is incredibly important to follow an extended maintenance phase following any series of fat loss phases. We obviously want to get in awesome shape, but we also want to be able to stay in shape once we are done with the tough part of the process. Most programs never account for staying in shape once the hard work has been done. 

Well, this part has gotten pretty long so I’m going to go ahead and wrap it up here. In the next part we will cover everything nutrition. I will go over setting your initial calories and macros, meal timing and frequency, as well as how to pick the eating routine that will work best for you and what kinds of foods can be helpful along the way. I’ll probably post that tomorrow or the next day but if you have any questions, just drop them below. 

Until next time!

1hs4dts,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1hs4dts/what_happens_when_you_bring_them_home_success/,What happens when you bring them home: success story ,"A few years ago during COVID I (38 white male) moved to Guadalajara, Mexico for better weather, better food, and better woman.  I downloaded Tinder to have some fun.  To make sure I wasn’t wasting my time, I’d schedule a phone call before I met the girls from Tinder in-person (I speak mediocre Spanish).  I found most of my matches were either expats, foreigners traveling through, or Mexicans who lived or studied abroad in an English speaking country.  I also met a few girls at bars and coffee shops, but all the good looking ones had kids (this is typical amongst most Latin American countries).  

Eventually, I met a cute Mexican girl named Marbella who had just moved back to Mexico from London.  She was in grad school in London and was working there for a couple years.  Marbella was 27 at that time, 5 foot 3, 110lbs, brown hair, beautiful brown eyes…she’s not a Mexican supermodel, but I’d say she’s slightly above average for girls from central Mexico.  

Marbella and I started going out once a week for the next few weeks.  We slept together on our 2nd date. Then once a week turned into twice a week, and then nearly every day.  We also spent a weekend in Tulum.  At this time, I was still thinking this was a fling and had no intentions on continuing to date her after returning to the states.  

After a couple more weeks, the time came to move back to the states.  I asked Marbella if she’d be interested in visiting, and she immediately said yes.  She bought her plane ticket for a month later and I went home (she has her travel VISA for the states).  

When she came up to visit, things went back to how we were in Mexico.  Lots of fun, exploring, partying.  She kept extending her trip until she had to return (Travel VISAS last 6 months).  A couple months after she left I returned to Mexico and we tracked around together for 3 months.  We went nearly everywhere in the country.  

At this point, my relationship with Marbella was extremely easy with little to no drama.  She was easy going, kind, friendly, cute, educated…nearly everything I was looking for. 

Marbella came back to visit in another month, and I asked her to marry me.  Fast forward 3 years, and we now have a daughter, house, careers.  

The only big change I’ve seen in Marbella since getting married is when we had our daughter.  She’s definitely become more difficult since having the baby, but I think that’s universal…nothing unbearable.  

We travel back to Mexico every couple years to visit family and are generally happy.  It’s been 5 years since I met her, she seems to be a much better partner than most American women.  Educated, fit, honest, comes from a good family, etc.  But that could all change as many of us know!!! ",36,1735851792.0,thepassportbros,15,0.92,False

I’ve been in the picture for a decade, and all I’m ever asked is how is my mom, and what do we eat for X holiday? Every single time. We only see my in-laws on birthdays and holidays now because of how toxic they are. 

My BIL thinks he’s being smart “instigating” something by asking me again “so what did you guys eat???” For Xmas, and then MIL is pulling my husband aside saying “you aren’t eating too much meat are you?” She neglected him, all of her kids actually. She flip flops between he’s eating too much to too little meat, and sugar is bad and then sugar is ok again. Coffee is bad, now coffee is good. It’s the opposite of whatever she thinks he’s doing with me. Like these people (MIL & BIL) think they can control what he eats when he’s with me. It’s hard to explain and I’m sure sounds silly. 

It’s like all this woman has because we don’t tell them anything personal. So I am thinking maybe this is actually a good thing? We literally don’t tell them anything anymore. Work is good, been busy, nope nothing new. 

I’m just sick of it though. I feel like I need perspective. We hardly see them and when we leave their BS stays there. 

I answered BIL as if he’s never asked the question before. “Oh we had this and that :-)” like always same stupid conversation. 

Also trying to make my husband feel drained “ohhh you have to go back there?” To my family’s house for both Xmas and Xmas Eve. 

My husband ignored MIL point blank and looked upset with BIL and he just answered him normal like he wasn’t trying to be negative. 

I am just so bothered by everything but then I think to myself, I think this is supposed to be the best way to deal? 

Are they much more bothered than I am? Do they get angry about us not being able to be controlled? And whatever their issues are?

I am starting to feel less angry as time goes on and be able to live my life, but then my brain goes on the hamster wheel sometimes still. 

I hope it torments them that we just live our lives. A lot of other things have of course happened over time. 

Editing to add- I get the feeling like BIL especially is trying to get info or a reaction. We never react, we used to react by answering, but have stopped in the past year+. ",2,1735851654.0,inlaws,3,1.0,False

1hs48br,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hs48br/did_i_ruin_christmas/,Did I ruin Christmas ,"To start, my sister-in-law and I don't get along. I feel like she baby-trapped my brother, but I love my niece and nephew. So, while I don't like my sister-in-law, I respect them both as parents and their decisions.



(this is long)



This Christmas was a bit of a shit show. Usually, the family would do one gift per person. Everybody would get something funny or practical because it was all adults. I like bow ties and socks, and people would get me some of the most unique bow ties I've ever seen. But ever since my brother had kids, people would get the kids a lot of stuff, and then the adults would get one or two things, which is fine, and I kind of felt like this had become the standard kid's lots of stuff, adults one thing.





So, a few months before December, I went to my niece and nephew and asked them what they wanted. My nephew wanted a few games off of his Steam wish list. I thought that was super easy, but my niece really wanted a baby doll; she wanted a Black baby doll, Here's some context; she is very, very light-skinned and she wanted a black baby doll because she wanted a baby doll that looked like her dad because she didn't. She doesn't understand why she didn't look as brown as her daddy; let me tell you, I have never ugly cried as hard or as much after I had that conversation with that little girl, ( She was DAMN SURE going to get that doll).



So a few weeks before Christmas rolled around, I started looking for this damn doll. I went to six different stores to find the right one yes, I could have gone to Amazon, but I wanted to pick it up personally, the last store had the right doll; it had accessories. I took the doll to an actual baby store and asked them what clothes would fit. I bought her a bunch of baby clothes so she could put the baby doll in all these clothes that actually fit. I mean, my entire thought was to give her as much baby stuff to go with the baby doll as I could afford, and my original budget was about 500 dollars there's two of them I thought okay between the two of them $500 and 500 is thousand that's more enough to spend on the kids, I went over very quickly ( I work in tech as it wasn't hurting me to spend a bit and there's no dollar limit to the kids, for the grown-ups we try to stay under 100 dollars)

So Christmas was getting a little bit closer, and I started thinking about what I was getting for my nephew. After getting all this stuff for my niece, I knew he wanted things from his Steam wish list, but after spending so much on my niece, I thought it would be only appropriate to try to match how much I spent. I knew my nephew's computer was about 3 years old, so I thought the quickest and easiest way to match or get close to would be to build him a new PC from scratch, so I did just that.





I shipped the gifts after I had wrapped them to be at my mother's house because that's where we decided we would all do Christmas; I fly out a whole week before, so I'm already there. I got a hotel, saw some old friends who never left home, then went over to Mom's for Christmas Eve dinner and to spend the night (I don't know why, but as an adult,t it's super uncomfortable to sleep in my old room, mom doesn't like it when we don't spend the night at the house so Christmas Eve if we just give to her and we'll spend the night then wake up on Christmas Day and then go wherever we need to go) my sister-in-law and my brother get there with the kids they walk in, see the tree, and go bananas, they see all the stuff, and I told him that a good portion of it is for them (I had this elaborate idea to do a Santa Claus thing but my sister-in-law said that they don't want to do Santa Claus they don't believe \[and by they I mean she\] that people should be telling their children about Santa Clauses as if he is a real person in this day and age) and this is where things start to go south.



My brother is super nice and gives me the world's biggest hug (ask if I want to wait till Mom goes to sleep and smoke weed in the backyard underneath this big old tree like we did when we were kids \[ of course, I say yes\]) ask me if I got him anything cool I told him I'd hope he thinks what I got him is cool not too far behind was my sister-in-law she gives me a hug and asks me who all the presents are for and told her that 99% of it is for her kids she gets this really sour look and tells me that she thought Christmas was going to be small, and how I was doing this to undermine them as parents. I told her that, I had no idea what she was talking about. She then went on in a hissy hushed tone that maybe I would have an idea about what she was talking about if I had asked them what to get the kids instead of asking them and spending all this money, spoiling them. (no I will give it to her here maybe I should have talked to them maybe I should have asked but I have never had that happen before every Christmas until I joined the Navy might aunt and uncles would come directly to me and as far as I knew never talk to Mom about what they should get me at all) I told her I was sorry that I wasn't trying to undermine them or anything, I told her that next year I asked them both about gifts and the budget that they wanted to have for their kids I also said hey for their birthdays nothing super elaborate I'll just get them gift cards or something small. She was still pissy, told me the damage was already done, and stormed off.



Christmas Eve dinner was nothing but her giving me side eye evil looks and making snide comments about child Free People and how flaunting our wealth over people with children is inappropriate and uncalled for, I tried to ignore it she was upset and deep in her feelings, and it's my mom's house and I don't want to make this any worse I don't want to cause a scene in my mother's house on Christmas Eve, so I decided to shut up take it deal with her for the few hours that we have to be together and then she can take stank attitude home and let my brother deal with it. Everyone goes to bed my brother and I sneak out back smoke a joint we talk about how Mom would kill us if she knew sneak back into the house and go to bed we figured that the kids are going to be up in a few hours with all that stuff to open they're not sleeping all that long. 







Getting woken up at 6:00 a.m by the sound of screaming running children only reaffirmed my decision never to have children, but nevertheless, hearing them running down the stairs screaming told me I better get my butt down there too. I get downstairs, make a cup of coffee then go sit on the couch around the tree.  People are handing out gifts, and the grown-ups open their one or two things. I love my new bow tie. My brother was dying for a Google watch so I got him one; my mother really wanted a new Crock-Pot from Williams-Sonoma (because Miss Vicky next door had one and it was so nice) my brother had asked me if I could get my sister-in-law an iPhone because he really couldn't afford it he would get her something else but this is something that she really wanted said fine she got it, I got a nasty look and a thank you that felt more like a ""fuck you"" and once again a speech with the undertone of child free people make too much money and maybe should contribute more to society instead of being child free. 



So then it was the kids turn my nephew ripped into the box for his keyboard, Monitor and mouse they were brand new and better than the one he had he gave me this confused thank you until I brought out his brand new tower I also told him that I bought him his steam wish list he was  super excited and couldn't wait to get home and hook it all in and start playing; we got him a little table set him up for the time being so he could start playing with stuff



And then of course my niece she started unwrapping all the baby clothes and the stroller and the accessories but it wasn't until she got to the baby doll itself did I see her face light up, she was losing it I got the biggest hug the biggest thank you a million kisses on the cheek just over the moon excited. I loved seeing her that happy my sister-in-law apparently did not.  She locked eyes with me and asked my niece to come over to her she wanted to see the baby doll, she asked her if she was okay with that baby doll or did she want one that looked more like her. I told my sister-in-law that this is the exact baby doll that she wanted that she was super happy my sister-in-law kept pushing and saying well you know you really should have a baby doll that looks like you all this while keeping eyes locked with me. My niece didn't waver for a second she told her so many times that that is the baby doll that she wanted she had a name picked out for the Baby doll,  she was super happy. My sister-in-law gets up sits beside me and in a tone everyone can hear started to ask why I chose to get a baby doll that didn't look like my niece why am I trying to push an agenda on her why I felt the need to ruin her Christmas and force her to play with a baby doll that looks nothing like her that it's confusing her, then on to talk about how I'm spoiling her children how I am not about family values how if I would have children of my own I could make decisions about gift giving but this is ridiculous no children should have this much spent on them next year I won't be allowed to get them anything instead of waiting for things to escalate I told my mom my brother and my niece and nephew to have a Merry Christmas went upstairs got dressed packed my things and went back to the hotel, my phone blew up for the rest of the day my mother begging me to come back for Christmas dinner my brother saying that the kids really wanted to see me before I had to leave I ignored them I went to see Nosferatu and I flew back home, the next week I called my brother and my mom to apologize tell them that I love them both that I hope to see them next year.

Here is some advice from someone who got out of an intense burnout. Instead of trying to force fix your biggest problems, start from the small things that you may have neglected. I found Maslow's hierarchy of needs to offer a good visual in terms of your base. You can visualize it as if it were a triangular hierarchy, where your physiological needs exemplify your base.

The five levels of the hierarchy are: 

* **Physiological**: The most basic needs, such as food, water, shelter, and sleep.
* **Safety**: The need for security, stability, and freedom from fear
* **Love and belonging**: The need for interpersonal relationships, friendship, intimacy, and acceptance
* **Esteem**: The need for self-worth, accomplishment, and respect
* **Self-actualization**: The need to achieve one's full potential and creativity

This is quite simplified by the way there are likely more components you can add per each level. I often see lots of people trying to perfect their ego-wants while ignoring their lowest needs.

First, it is important to note that our body and anatomy are not made to care about our wants or ego-based ambitions. Our body simply wants to stay alive, be healthy, and be stable. Without achieving these innate needs that are held by our body, you can't make it enact your higher ambitious wants.

**Working out and diet**

If you are ever getting to a point where you are forgetting to eat, or perhaps you are eating too much, you are neglecting working out, just to better work on your ambitions then you are setting yourself up for intense failure. Speaking from experience as someone who was ""forgetting"" to eat anything throughout the whole day and so.

Interestingly, research finds that some of the highest-achieving people tend to work out more. I am not here to conflate a correlation relationship to that of a causation but, really, working out is meant to go alongside one's incentives, not to replace them.

[Here is a study showing that wealthier people exercise significantly more than the non-rich](https://richhabits.net/successful-wealthy-people-jog-more-than-the-non-rich/).

**Stress, anxiety, and productivity**

Stress and productivity have an inversely proportional kind of relationship. By stress, I don't mean the simple adrenaline rush you get on a Monday before the exam. By stress, I am talking about the full-on nerve-wracking, anxiety-provoking, sensation you constantly get, hindering you from doing anything you may need to.

Stress is a bodily indicator that something is wrong. By wrong, it could mean many things, even that you may not be aware of. For example, maybe you are not attending to something important, maybe you have bad time management, or maybe there are unresolved problems that you may be forgetting to attend to. It is very important to tackle the root cause of evoking these feelings. It is also important to note that everything in your system is connected, ranging from love life to physiological needs, and then to your psychological.

**Bad ways to deal with stress?**

* Resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as addictions
* Ignoring your responsibilities
* Sacrificing your other physiological or psychological needs to get a sense of coping.
* Letting it take you over, could manifest as workaholism or illogically spending too much time engaging in things that are unresolved at the expense of your other systems.

**Good ways to deal with stress/anxiety**

* Working on your lower level needs such as physiological or other psychological needs, manifesting as improving diet, and working out.
* Mindful exercises can happen through meditation.
* A very cold shower; works in making sure that the stress you are dealing with doesn't prevade you.
* Control your emotions, don't let them control you.
* Reduce coffee or stimulant-related drugs.
* Find the root cause, causing your stress, is there something you are neglecting? How is your life? Do you have a responsibility to attend to? Are you engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms?

**Sleep**

This too is unfairly neglected, I believe that sleep is quite very important in gaining stability in life. The lowest points of my life are heavily correlated to a lack of sleep, again this is not to make a correlation-causation relationship but to give you an idea of its importance.

Research shows that sleep is very much known to improve dopamine production, cognitive functions, emotional stability, and discipline. If you are compromising your sleep significantly to attend to your other systems, this will inevitably lead to an unstable sense of self-regulation.

**Small things that helped me (personally)**

* Engaging in spirituality, even in an atheistic form
* Very cold morning showers
* Cleaning and organizing my room every day
* A consistent walk in nature or parks
* Very immaculate personal hygiene-to be fair, I always had great hygiene but the perfection really aids your confidence and self-care.
* Running everyday
* A consistently clean diet with no sweets or junk

**Visualization of an upside down triangle-a flipping the Maslow's hierarchy of needs**

To have a stable base, in terms of having your psychological or physiological needs met, means to be able to have a more consistent set of self-discipline, a more stable incentive, and a more stable goal. Compromising your basic needs for your wants would lead to an upside-down triangle, inevitably falling. A triangle cannot stand on the base of its tip, attempting that would lead to a broken system, which could manifest as burnout, urging you to start from the bottom, hope this helped.

1hs46tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hs46tn/the_little_things_very_much_matter_dont_sacrifice/,"The little things VERY MUCH matter, don't sacrifice some systems of your life at the expense of the other: Maslow's hierarchy of needs (how I got out of an intense burnout)","Here is some advice from someone who got out of an intense burnout. Instead of trying to force fix your biggest problems, start from the small things that you may have neglected. I found Maslow's hierarchy of needs to offer a good visual in terms of your base. You can visualize it as if it were a triangular hierarchy, where your physiological needs exemplify your base.

The five levels of the hierarchy are: 

* **Physiological**: The most basic needs, such as food, water, shelter, and sleep.
* **Safety**: The need for security, stability, and freedom from fear
* **Love and belonging**: The need for interpersonal relationships, friendship, intimacy, and acceptance
* **Esteem**: The need for self-worth, accomplishment, and respect
* **Self-actualization**: The need to achieve one's full potential and creativity

This is quite simplified by the way there are likely more components you can add per each level. I often see lots of people trying to perfect their ego-wants while ignoring their lowest needs.

First, it is important to note that our body and anatomy are not made to care about our wants or ego-based ambitions. Our body simply wants to stay alive, be healthy, and be stable. Without achieving these innate needs that are held by our body, you can't make it enact your higher ambitious wants.

**Working out and diet**

If you are ever getting to a point where you are forgetting to eat, or perhaps you are eating too much, you are neglecting working out, just to better work on your ambitions then you are setting yourself up for intense failure. Speaking from experience as someone who was ""forgetting"" to eat anything throughout the whole day and so.

Interestingly, research finds that some of the highest-achieving people tend to work out more. I am not here to conflate a correlation relationship to that of a causation but, really, working out is meant to go alongside one's incentives, not to replace them.

[Here is a study showing that wealthier people exercise significantly more than the non-rich](https://richhabits.net/successful-wealthy-people-jog-more-than-the-non-rich/).

**Stress, anxiety, and productivity**

Stress and productivity have an inversely proportional kind of relationship. By stress, I don't mean the simple adrenaline rush you get on a Monday before the exam. By stress, I am talking about the full-on nerve-wracking, anxiety-provoking, sensation you constantly get, hindering you from doing anything you may need to.

Stress is a bodily indicator that something is wrong. By wrong, it could mean many things, even that you may not be aware of. For example, maybe you are not attending to something important, maybe you have bad time management, or maybe there are unresolved problems that you may be forgetting to attend to. It is very important to tackle the root cause of evoking these feelings. It is also important to note that everything in your system is connected, ranging from love life to physiological needs, and then to your psychological.

**Bad ways to deal with stress?**

* Resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as addictions
* Ignoring your responsibilities
* Sacrificing your other physiological or psychological needs to get a sense of coping.
* Letting it take you over, could manifest as workaholism or illogically spending too much time engaging in things that are unresolved at the expense of your other systems.

**Good ways to deal with stress/anxiety**

* Working on your lower level needs such as physiological or other psychological needs, manifesting as improving diet, and working out.
* Mindful exercises can happen through meditation.
* A very cold shower; works in making sure that the stress you are dealing with doesn't prevade you.
* Control your emotions, don't let them control you.
* Reduce coffee or stimulant-related drugs.
* Find the root cause, causing your stress, is there something you are neglecting? How is your life? Do you have a responsibility to attend to? Are you engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms?

**Sleep**

This too is unfairly neglected, I believe that sleep is quite very important in gaining stability in life. The lowest points of my life are heavily correlated to a lack of sleep, again this is not to make a correlation-causation relationship but to give you an idea of its importance.

Research shows that sleep is very much known to improve dopamine production, cognitive functions, emotional stability, and discipline. If you are compromising your sleep significantly to attend to your other systems, this will inevitably lead to an unstable sense of self-regulation.

**Small things that helped me (personally)**

* Engaging in spirituality, even in an atheistic form
* Very cold morning showers
* Cleaning and organizing my room every day 
* A consistent walk in nature or parks
* Very immaculate personal hygiene-to be fair, I always had great hygiene but the perfection really aids your confidence and self-care. 
* Running everyday 
* A consistently clean diet with no sweets or junk
* Being less quick to anger or less quick to let my anxiety take over me.

But why?

As someone who worked in the craft beer industry when people thought that craft beer was actually Kraft (Mac and cheese) brand beer, the sentiment reminds me all too much of the hate craft beer got from “regular” beer drinkers.

Replace the word “beer” with “coffee” in the below statements that I’d hear regularly. 

“It’s just flavored beer.” “Beer isn’t supposed to be fruity.” “They’re just masking the flavor of bad beer with other stuff.” “That’s not real beer.”

Yet we all know that those people were left in the dust and quickly changed their tune as the craft beer industry took off and “real beer companies” started adopting these styles. This feels like deja vu. 

Obviously whether or not someone likes experimental coffees is one thing but discrediting the roaster and saying that they’re not making “real coffee” is something else entirely. 

So why such harsh criticism for those experimenting outside the norms when it’s very clearly the direction the industry is headed?",0,1735851266.0,pourover,27,0.42,False

1hs41qv,https://i.redd.it/yhhsn2248nae1.jpeg,How to better arrange the furniture in this room?,"Today is the day we are un-decorating from Christmas and deep cleaning our great room. For me this is an excellent opportunity to rearrange furniture and refresh the and I’m looking for ideas for new ways to do that.


I’m attaching a [not-to-scale drawing](https://imgur.com/a/RnnTbQL) of the room. This is a carpeted space with open concept connections to a dining room (to the right) and a large kitchen island with seating (at the bottom of the drawing). The line drawn is a division between the existing carpet and linoleum situation which I would love to change but cannot anytime soon. 


I have also included in the drawing the location of a floor outlet which, while handy for lighting, is not ideally located. I feel like the location of this outlet causes the furniture to be anchored oddly far back from the fireplace, which is the obvious focal point of this room. However, leaving the outlet unused and uncovered/floating in the space feels wrong, as well. Someday we will get new flooring and change this, but we are working with what we have. 


The furniture in this room is as follows: loveseat (54x36), 2 recliners (36x36), armchair (36x36) with ottoman (36x20), antique rocking chair (36x36), coffee table (48x24), 2 end tables (20x24), and a small end table (17x26). The rocking chair and an end table are currently in the guest bedroom (because Christmas tree), but could stay there if they don’t work out. 


How would you arrange furniture in this room? I’d prefer not to buy anything new, but would consider it if it really is a solution to the weirdness of this space. Any and all suggestions would be great (including future decorating ideas because we’ve done nothing to the space but remove busy wallpaper). TIA!",1,1735850960.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Should I make a “how to learn to program in 2025” post? Some guide on the state of the market and how to best navigate it? Address the doom and gloom? Highlight the realities?

I can’t remember what I wrote, but a long ways into it, I just came to the conclusion that what I’d like to say isn’t about the market / or the code / or the school. It’s about **the people**.

TL:DR? : here's a video of my real IRL face talking about it → [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSVJI4CzpqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSVJI4CzpqY)

I know that for some people, learning to code is about the job and the salary and is a means to an end. I respect that. But I want to zoom out (*or in*) just a little. We have a community of people here. Some are anonymous. Some are publicly known. Some percentage is probably bots. But **the humans** are here for *a reason*.

Maybe they’re looking to change careers. Maybe they’ve been self-studying and are looking for structure. Recommendations / stories. Maybe they’re here to warn people about a negative experience or to point out bad actors. Maybe they’re here to help people make better decisions than they made. Maybe they’re here to vent. Maybe it’s a boot camp that wants to tell you about updates in their curriculum or share their unique angle on tech education. Maybe it’s a seasoned vet who wants to share insights about the industry or people on the hiring side of things.

Maybe they’re 17 or 77 or from a different country or cultural situation. Maybe they’re disappointed and angry. Maybe they’re under different stresses than you can relate to. Maybe they’re bright-eyed and naive and here to ask their very first question. But we’re people- and I think we have a lot more *in common* than we realize.

Just in the last year, I've made connections with people from Spain, South America, Ukraine, the Middle East, and so many other places. It’s wild when someone messages you to say, “*Thank you for your help. I’m sorry I didn’t get back to you about that one thing—my country is at war now, so it might be a while*.” Situations like that put everything in perspective. It’s a reminder that behind the text, there’s always a person with a story, and sometimes, it’s far more complex than we can imagine. Someone might be battling depression, struggling to learn coding for years, and feeling stuck and hopeless. Another might be upset about losing their $180k job in San Francisco and unsure about their next steps. And then there’s someone else who’s had to sell their laptop or pick up a rifle to defend their home in the middle of a war.

The pandemic messed us up. I have a stepdaughter, so I’ve seen how she and her friends had to live their lives differently. The tech/design meetups shut down or just weren’t very useful on zoom. Many of my friends moved away. I’m sure some good things came of it (I can’t speak for you) but I think *it changed things*. It changed how the industry worked, how people were hired, how they worked, and brought in a lot of challenges. 

While working from home has its benefits / flexibility / fewer commutes -it also disconnected us. Many of us lost the in-person interactions that build trust and community, and that disconnection has left us more vulnerable to isolation, uncertainty, and fear of what’s next. Combine that with the rapid rise of AI, job uncertainties, and political instability, and it’s easy to see why so many people are confused and angry. 

It changed things for boot camps too. The fact is - (among the obvious money-grabs) there were some good boot camps. For some people / paired with the right background and school, it was a win. But then everything had to go online. We lost some of the humanity and connection that made them work.

I was lucky to have a very active online video-based group of people to work with via PE (that was not planned based on the pandemic), but I know a lot of people got really lonely. Depending on age and situation, from my experience, we’ve lost a lot of core personal connection. I think this plays a big role in where we’re at right now with hiring. Some of the core soft-skill are really missing. I've interviewed hundreds of people now over the last four years from this sub - and there's a wide variety of things to discuss there -- but a key theme is that they don't have a community and they aren't getting practice pairing and communicating.

People are freaked out about “AI” and jobs and politics. There really are a lot of unknowns. But that’s our **reality**. I’ve always found immense value in forums and StackOverflow and tech/design Slacks and Discord—and here on Reddit. But it can feel more and more *anonymous*. Sometimes it feels like we’re all arguing—but we’re probably not *really* listening to each other. We aren’t truly “hearing” one another or understanding the reality behind the words. It’s just text on a screen, stripped of tone, context, and the humanity behind it. Only a teeny tiny fraction of people are willing to get together IRL and talk about it.

I’ve written all sorts of wacky things around here to stir things up. I think one time I wrote a post about how “Nobody cares about you or if you get a job” and how most advice is projection. But it doesn’t have to be that way. We could actually get to know each other *in real life*.

We could actually help each other. Not just with code questions or vague advice about portfolios, but really help each other—by connecting, by listening, by being human. I know that sounds corny, but it’s true. The best things I’ve learned didn’t come from tutorials or books. They came from conversations, from pair programming, from working through real problems with other people.

I’m not saying online forums and Slack groups aren’t valuable - they absolutely are. But **nothing replaces real human connection**. Nothing replaces sitting down with someone and saying, “I’m stuck. Can you help me figure this out?” and then figuring it out together. You learn faster, you understand more deeply, and you build something even more valuable: **trust**.

And while we’re at it, **let’s also rethink what we’re building and who we’re building it for**. We can’t rely on big corporations to be our shepherds forever—they’re not designed to look out for us. They lay off thousands without a second thought and focus on making investors happy. But as developers and creators - **we have the tools to shape our own future**. Let’s think about building our *own* companies, creating our *own* opportunities, and crafting tools and systems that work for real people, not just profit margins. If we don’t take responsibility for what gets designed and released into the world, we’re just handing over that power to faceless corporations and algorithms. We can build things that bring balance - and that don't only focus on growth.

So, here are some things *I'm doing* this year to encourage humanity and in-person/online connection:  I’m committing to [open-office hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/1gxf3rw/resuming_free_office_hours_career_advice/) / free time for anyone who wants to talk about getting into the industry, improving their skills, or just making sense of how to fit into this strange world of tech. I’m also hosting interviews and discussions with people from across the design and development spectrum, because I think we all have something to learn from each other’s stories. ([*get in touch*](https://sheriffderek.consulting/) *if you're interested in having a conversation and sharing it*). I'm starting a local design/dev meetup at our office, and we're launching some exciting stuff at PE that will allow us to expand our network. ;) 

**So, as we step into 2025, here’s my invitation**: 

Make it the year you build real connections. Talk to the people who’ve helped you online. Reach out to someone you’ve argued with and have an actual conversation. Pair program with a friend—or a stranger. Join a meetup, or if there isn’t one where you live, start one. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to happen. In a world of bots and AI and increasingly more bullshit -- **be a human**.

And one more thing: Show appreciation. Not the superficial bullshit we throw around on LinkedIn, but the real kind. If someone’s made a difference in your life, *tell them*. If a stranger helped you solve a problem, let them know it mattered. People don’t hear that enough. They’re too busy hearing the noise—the trolls, the rejections, the doubts. **Be the person** who cuts through that. It's not ""cringe"" to care about people. Let's get back to a place where we actually know each other - and we don't have to assume that everyone is out to trick us, OK? It's all right there for us to *decide* to embrace.

Obviously this isn't the only issue, but really it's just the straw that broke the camels back. 

A week or two ago I had a moment of clarity. 

He was arguing with me because earlier that day in order to start cleaning up our bedroom, because we recently bought and moved into a new house, I divided my, our son, and my husbands dirty clothes that had up until that point all been combined in a moving box. My husband does his own laundry and I take care of my and our toddlers clothes. I had put his dirty clothes in a basket, and kept it away from his clean clothes. (Side note he tends to mingle clean and dirty on the floor regardless because he's literally a trash person but I digress, just another issue with him.) I was in the process of getting ready to bathe and therefore his clothing was not at the forefront of my mind. He had taken the clothes in the dirty basket and dumped them into his clean clothes, and only AFTER the fact did I even notice what basket he had and then informed him they were dirty. The argument from him was I ""should have told him sooner"" but again and as I explained to him it wasn't on my mind, he's also a grown 🍑 man and could simply do a sniff test? This argument went on for 20+ minutes and finally I said ""this argument is going around in circles, next time I'm just not going to say anything and save myself an argument!"" Last time I do anything for him. He wanted to continue arguing and I was tired and just wanted to shower and go to bed. So I asked him to leave the bedroom because I was done and wanted to shower. I ended up having to repeat over and over ""please leave the room, this isn't going anywhere please remove yourself to go cool down"" he never leaves me alone when I ask(another red flag I know he's a giant red flag) I had to physically usher him out, I didnt touch him, but I did make moves to close the door in his face. FINALLY he walked away and of course he can't just STFU and he goes ""you're acting crazy"" .... because I was just repeating I wanted him gone and not saying anything else. He has a tendency to say ""you're crazy like your mom"" or other iterations(you're crazy, you're acting crazy, etc)now yes my mother does have mental health issues. Issues with I don't even know what because I had to cut her off(lots of abuse from her in childhood, and I'm talking with my therapist on the possible CPTSD they noticed during my ND screening), but there were mentions in the past by her possibly Bipolar, she's tried to commit sewer slide several times in the past, etc. lots of mental health issues. So when he says I'm ""crazy"" it really sets me off and he does it on purpose so then I DO ""act crazy"" because I'm sick of his 💩 at that point. So I was just standing in front of the mirror getting ready just letting the ridiculousness of the whole argument just really sink in. I told myself ""enough is enough"" and I went out into the living room where he was and told him the next time he calls me a derogatory name(his faves are B***h, C U Next Tuesday, and his favorite: Crazy.) that I'll leave him. 

I shouldn't even HAVE to set that boundary in the first place! 

He acted like his world was ENDING. I'm not even joking he was staring at the ground head in hands like I told him his cat just died or something! He of course tried to say whatever excuses and I stopped him told him very sternly ""this is me letting you know. You don't need to say anything. This is ME telling YOU.""

Anyway to the title of this post:

This morning he was home. Not usually a day he's home. Today is a holiday for USPS so he doesn't have to work. Yayyyy.....

I have ADHD and autistic traits(diagnosed) and therefore routines are my life and when he's home he fucks up my routines so bad. In the morning I make my coffee, and while that's going I make our son breakfast. Usually some eggos with fruit and a cup of milk. Husband was in the (small) kitchen; essentially in the way. The coffee machine (Keurig) was out of water. I don't like to take the tank off, because there's always stuff in the way, and I end up making a mess EVERY TIME trying to get it back into the machine. I will take a large cup(limited time avatar way of water cup) to refill the machine. I fill the cup up 2x and that's the way I do it and it works perfect for me. The whole argument was over how I fill the coffee machine up ""wrong"" and how /I/ was in the way in the kitchen because he wanted to make breakfast but literally I'm just doing my morning routine. 

I'm just so done. I can't anymore. What a stupid thing to start arguing about, and literally the morning of the new year no less, and I realized I can't do this anymore. So I went into the basement to remove myself from the argument. When I finished my breakfast and coffee, I came upstairs to do my workout, because I recently stepped on the scale and didn't like the number I saw and have been unhappy with myself since having my son almost 2 years ago. He tried to say some stuff but tbh at this point I'm tuning him out. I just don't even want to be around him or converse with him because an argument will start. Anyway I just told him I'm tired and I'm done, and now suddenly after literally HALF A YEAR of BEGGING him to get us marriage counseling he suddenly wants to start. Signed us up for counseling and everything. 

It's now almost 3 and he said he wants ME to try counseling??? Me? IVE BEEN READY!! I told him the notebook I had him get me was FILLED with stuff for counseling and I've BEEN READY FOR A LONG TIME, and HES the one who needs to try. That if he's not doing this for himself there's no fucking point. 

I see no way of salvaging our relationship anymore honestly. I hate being around him, and everything is more peaceful with him out of the house, and I wish he had a job that took him away for months at a time. I wish I'd never met him, I wish when my dumb🍑 left the first time I didnt go back. Now we have a child and I'm stuck to him for 18 years. 


Other fun facts:

He won't let me see any of the finances, no passwords to financial apps/cc apps, etc. And is essentially financially abusing me because I quit my budding career as a newly licensed nail tech to have our son and be a SAHM(I live in Wisconsin and at the time elective abortion was illegal, and my BC failed. Yay me I'm tied to this 🍑 for 18 years 🥲)
I'm now having to find some kind of work from home with a 2.5 year gap in my resume. 


He gaslights me all the time for example (and trust me after this incident he was DONE) he use to do pool league. One night he decided after pool, where he drinks, he and some dudes I've NEVER met would walk to our new house to smoke the 🌿 he had stored there. Turned out he didn't have the key to the house OR his wallet/ID so he BROKE IN. He's lucky the neighbors didn't call the cops. And he told me if they had he would have just told the cops he was there cleaning(home was previously owned by an indoor smoker and we were in the process of cleaning the walls and floors) uhm...yeah a police officer is totally gonna buy 2-3 drunk dudes ""cleaning"" an empty house. Later he denied he ever told me he would tell the police he was cleaning. Oh yeah we're both 30. A 30 year old man breaking into a house with no ID is DEFINITELY a normal thing to do. /s

Has issues with alcohol. Use to be a hardcore alcoholic when he lived in Cali before his car accident(he was not the driver) we tried to go camping one year with his parents and younger brother and he got blackout drunk, choked his mom, and spent the weekend in jail(first time I should have left him). He was court ordered not to touch alcohol for 1 year and during that time would HIDE cans from me. I now have to monitor any drinking he does(I don't drink due to medications) and he's no longer allowed to play pool due to him drinking there, coming home slurring his speech, and then starting arguments. Tells me he DOESNT have problems with alcohol. Riiight... because it's normal for people to hide alcohol cans...

Tells me he DOESN'T have daddy issues despite the fact that weekend he got arrested he told his brother ""at least you get to grow up with a dad""(referring to his step dad. Husbands bio dad died when he was 12 and he never got to meet him) and any time he'd get drunk after that he'd say he feels guilty for not keeping in contact with his dad's mom, and how she guilt trips him for not keeping in contact but she literally never calls him and phones work both ways.
But sure....no daddy issues...

Tells me he DOESNT have issues communicating his emotions but every time he does he goes straight to yelling or crying. Right...

Anyway...
Now I admit I do have my own issues but I've been taking the steps to help myself. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and autistic traits, going to get on meds February (soonest opening I could get), currently on meds for my depression and anxiety, the place that diagnosed me also does counseling services and does virtual visits that I'm using, cut my hair and started putting in effort to bring my curls out(using all new products I don't even know what to do with but I'm learning!) working out, and just generally bettering myself. 

But I'm just done. I'm tried of being called crazy, not wanting to even talk to or be near him because I know an argument will start, tired of him saying being a SAHM isn't a job because he works 2 jobs(by choice he could drop down to 1 if he really wanted) 
 and taking care of our toddler is ""easy"" when our son acts completely different with him, and he doesn't experience the screaming, hitting, and biting I experience all day long. Of course it's easy when he gets to be the ""fun dad"" who doesn't enforce ""no"" and I don't even get a break on holidays/when he's in the room/when other adults are in the room, because according to him he just ""doesn't think about it""... you're literally a parent what do you mean you don't think about it? Why am I the only one actively listening/watching our child when we do try and spend time with each other but I'm STILL having to be the only parent?

It would be easier without him, since there wouldn't be his BS to deal with on the daily. I'm now looking to find a stay at home job, because like I said no access to finances(couldn't leave even if I wanted! )and paying for childcare would take a huge chunk of my pay. The goal is to become financially independent within the next year and then leave him. I don't see any way to save this relationship because he thinks I'm the whole problem, and that he's just perfect and there's no issues on his end, and according to him everyone else loves him and gets along great with him. Yeah! Because they only have to deal with his 🍑 for 2-3 hrs a day and he's on his best behavior! 5 years of my life wasted on this man child. I don't even want to leave to date other people. I'm too tired for that 💩 too I just don't want to be with him anymore. There's just too much BS for us to work anymore.

(Doctors who were telling me to quit caffeine didn’t even know the amount of caffeine they themselves were consuming and were unaware of how much caffeine is in a soda as compared to let’s say a coffee.)

If your doctor is telling you that caffeine is why you are dizzy, run away. 

Run away so so quickly

They are not using scientific data when treating you, and unless you’re going to a naturalist, you want a physician who utilizes scientific data during treatment, not gut feelings 

Especially when you consider that caffeine effects different people in different ways, as an example as a neurodivergent person with ADHD caffeine puts me to sleep it does not wake me up. 

For many years it was thought that vestibular migraines could be triggered by caffeine due to caffeine potentially causing the patient to be dehydrated, but it has been found through MRIs and other scientific methods that in fact vestibular migraines are not being triggered by caffeine in normal dosages. 

If you disagree with this post please do not use evidence based solely upon your own experience or the experience of people that you know. 

**Please link to scientific data and research articles to back up your assertions, not blog articles**

There is so much misinformation about dizziness out there, and since there is a real withdrawal effect from stopping caffeine intake quickly, it is important that people don’t have to deal with painful withdrawal for something that is not hurting them.

(obviously with everything, moderation, if you’re going to do 10 cups of coffee a day you’re probably gonna get a little fucked up)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33888039/

“Overall, these findings suggest that caffeine does not strongly influence the peripheral auditory and vestibular systems. Instead, caffeine's effects seem to occur almost solely at the level of the central nervous system.”

Most recently I've just been using a Nespresso, which I've been fairly impressed with for a pod machine, but would like to finally get into espresso. I live in the US in Colorado.

I've done some research online and in this sub, and see the Bambino and the Gaggia are consistently recommended. I only have an electric Cuisinart Burr Grinder, so I know I would need to upgrade that. Leaning toward a hand grinder for now, specifically the 1zpresso J Ultra.

I can't seem to decide which machine I should get. Also, is the Bambino Plus worth it for the included PID? Or is it better to get the Gaggia and get upgrades from Shade? I was leaning toward Bambino for price, and read some about it heating quicker etc, but how important is that really over potential benefits of the Gaggia?

I’ve always struggled with expressing emotions to my family, even though I love them deeply. Growing up, I wasn’t taught how to show affection, which has made me feel emotionally distant from my family. I find it easier to open up to my friends, but when it comes to family, I just can’t. Sometimes, my mom even asks if I love them at all, which hurts and makes me feel weird, so I usually avoid those conversations.

My brother and I have had a lot of fights growing up, and even now, the fighting hasn’t stopped. He believes our family supports me more than him, but that’s not true. In fact, it’s the opposite—our parents are usually more lenient with him because he used to get very sick as a kid if he cried. This made him feel untouchable, and now he acts like he’s superior to everyone in the family. He shouts at everyone, picks fights with me, and always assumes he’s stronger.

Recently, we moved to a new city for my college, and my parents put him in a new school with NEET coaching. The fees are extremely high (₹3.5L per year), and our family isn’t wealthy, but our parents are doing everything they can for his future. Unfortunately, he’s not studying seriously. If anyone in the family tries to talk to him about it, he throws tantrums, shouts, and even says, “Did I ask you to put me in this school?”

Just today, he asked me to make coffee for him while I was watching a movie. I told him I’d do it in 10 minutes, but he started shouting and demanding it immediately. I got angry and told him I felt like punching him in the face if he kept acting this way. He then taunted me, saying, “Come on, let’s see who gets knocked out.” I didn’t want to make a scene, so I ignored him. My mom, who was asleep, got up and made the coffee for him instead.

I’m really worried about his future. He’s not putting in the effort for NEET and doesn’t realize how competitive it is. If he doesn’t get good marks, he won’t have a backup plan since he’s taken Bio-CS. On top of that, I don’t know how he’s going to survive in the real world with this attitude. His behavior and mindset just don’t align with the reality of how hard life can be, and I’m afraid he’s setting himself up for failure.

I don’t know how to deal with him or help him understand the seriousness of the situation, and I’m also worried about how he’s going to survive with this attitude. How can I approach this without causing more fights?",2,1735850123.0,OffMyChestIndia,0,1.0,False

Kept temperature between 120 - 160 F. Turned every other day or so.  Original pile was 13-ish feet long, 4.5 feet wide, and 3.5 feet tall. An estimate of 260 lbs of material.  C:N ratio was \~ 3.5:1.

Stage 2 - Reconstructed hot pile into a taller narrower shaft of material 3ft wide, 4.5 ft deep and 5.5 ft deep.  I elevated the pile on top of some 4x4 timber and placed two 3"" perforated french drain tubes across the bottom and up through the pile.  Drain pipes were intended to help airflow.  Sides and top are made out of fence slats.  Pile was moistened to just a bit more damp than a damp sponge. No new green material.  However, I did gather some forest floor duff from the gambel oak groves near my home and sprinkled 7 gallons of duff throughout the pile when I reconstructed it. I'll let this sit as is through summer of 2025.  In the Fall of 2025 I will use it where it currently sits as a mock forest floor for planting some native understory bushes/trees.  That will be stage 3.

Some observations from Stage 2:

* The airflow is really good.  You can feel slightly warmed air flowing out the tubes.
* The temperature has been really consistent.  Using a thermometer at various parts of the pile the temperature has been between 60 F and 90 F for two weeks now.  Ambient temps have ranged from 10 F - 50 F during that time. 
* Fungi is present...I think.  Any trained eye available please correct me if I'm wrong. The attached photo looks like the mycelium of some unknown fungi. Second photo I kind of gently pulled the layers apart...you can really see it stretched out.

### Mental Shenanigans
1. **Check Yourself**: Seriously, grab a journal and spill your thoughts like you’re gossiping with your best friend. It’s cathartic, I promise!

Here is our trip report (late December 2024)!

OVERVIEW

Early 40s couple from the US. First time in Japan! We only had the holiday break so we booked a 10ish day trip from December 21 to January 1. I speak no Japanese but learned a few phrases (more below) and picked up some along the way – all super helpful!  I did research on this sub (arigatou gozimasu!) and other subreddits and travel websites (and the dreaded tik tok). Last year I went to South Africa, and loved guided tours from Airbnb Experiences and Getyourguide, so I also looked at those platforms for ideas/tours. We’re into art, food, music, museums, history, nature, nightlife, and like to walk a lot. 

PREP

Prior to entering Japan, we got Y147,000 ($1000), set up the GO app for taxi transit (worked really well), filled out VisitJapan and saved the QR codes, booked experiences, purchased Shinkansen tickets via the SmartEx app and saved the QR codes (and printed them). Set up Whatsapp to communicate with friends and family. 

We each packed a carryon and backpack, with an extra soft bag inside for anticipated gift purchases. I purchased two power converters from Amazon, each one held plugs and usb drives. Also brought Emergen-C packs which we took everyday. 

For internet, we used the Verizon $12/day travel pass which worked well as I stupidly couldn’t figure out how to setup an esim. Daily in Japan, I carried around a small crossbody purse with passport, AmEx, Welcome Suica card, and Yen, and other essentials, often battery packs for our phones. 

DAY BY DAY

(1 night Tokyo, 5 nights Osaka, 4 nights Tokyo)

**Sunday, December 22** ***(Tokyo)*****:**

**Thursday, December 26** ***(day trip to Kyoto):*** 

Delicious breakfast buffet at hotel. Metro to JR line to Kyoto. Beautiful morning in Arashiyama: Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple, followed by a walk to Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street, Sagano Bamboo Grove, tasty lunch at Arashiyama Tenryu Ramen, and then Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama. Afternoon with inlaws (who were also in Japan) walking the Philosophers Path. Very frustrating dinner experience in Kyoto where we kept getting rejected at empty restaurants (one was about to seat us and then the manager shooed us away), and then got super rude and unsanitary service at a restaurant that finally accepted us. JR/Metro back to hotel. 

**Friday, December 27** ***(morning day trip to Nara; evening bar crawl of Temma, Osaka):*** 

Metro (Kintetsu line) to majestic Nara: Deer Park, Todai-ji Namdaimon Temple (biggest seated Buddha in Japan), Kasugataisha Shrine (learned the Saisen prayer coin toss), and had mochi and lunch on Sanjo Dori Street. Got beautiful gifts in the stunning Nakagawa Masashichi Shoten store. Metro back to Osaka. Metro to evening Airbnb Experience of Temma Osaka – great locations and super fun! Ended night at karaoke with our new tour besties.

**Saturday, December, 28 (*****Osaka to Tokyo)***

Metro back to Shimokita where we did some vintage shopping and got a delicious dinner at Izakaya Kushiyaki Niyasai Zeroya. 

**Tuesday, December 31 (*****Tokyo)***

Metro to Asakusa, walk through Nakamise-Dori Shopping Street to Senso-ji Temple (felt like a pilgrimage as this is the most visited religious site in the world!) Walk to nearby Asakusa Sumo Experience (super fun, more below) which included lunch. Walk to Kappabashi Kitchen Street; realized the knives are super cool but out of our price range! Walk to Ueuo Park (loved) and then Akihabara (hated). Train to Shibuya Crossing (did time lapse video) and then walk to Yoyogi Park (we wanted to go to Meiji Shrine but went the wrong way in the park; it was beautiful at dusk so all good!) Train back to Shimokita where we got dinner at Abill (one of the few places open, and they had the NYE Japanese TV program on with famous musicians, actors, and comedians, which was cool to watch!), and then went to a fun, crowded rock show at Basement Bar and New Year’s toast next door at Coaster Craft Beer & Kitchen. Walk back to hotel.

**Wednesday, January 1 (*****Tokyo and depart)***

GO Taki with luggage to meet up with inlaws in Roppongi, get lunch, and then GO taxi to Haneda.

LOVES

**\*\*Kyoto: Arashiyama, especially Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple!** We had a beautiful time in Arashiyama. Because we were staying in Osaka, we took the metro/JR line to Kyoto Station and then a cab (there was a sign saying “foreigner friendly cabs”) to Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple. We said “Ohio Gozaiamasu” to the taxi driver which created a lot of goodwill and he pointed out places on our cab ride there (Y6000). The big highlight was Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple. Go here! It’s green, hilly, and full of hundreds of sculptures with fascinating faces. Originally built in 766, the hundreds of sculptures were added starting in the 1950s. The area is peaceful. After leaving the temple, there is a walkway towards the right that we walked down and had the most beautiful day! We walked by a quaint coffee shop (and got coffee and Chai), more temples, gift shops, beautiful homes, several Bamboo groves, before going to downtown Arashiyama where we got ramen at Arashiyama Tenryu Ramen. We loved this walk; it started so peacefully with few folks and then got more crowded as we got closer to the downtown area. We continued our peaceful walk across the bridge (and there are paddle boats you can rent!) and went to Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama. I love this park. It’s a 20 minute hike (I was huffing and puffing but fine) to the top of the hill, and then you get to be near the monkeys who run wild and you have a beautiful view of Kyoto. A stunning day. 

**\*\*Tokyo: Tsukiji Fish Market.** I know it’s a “tourist trap” but we had a great time. Walked here on our first morning around 7am and ate delicious Wagyu skewers, sashimi, grilled mochi, and more. 

**\*\*Hiroshima: Peace Memorial Museum.** Profound and devastating, it’s vital to know this history and to remember the people who died and lived throughout this time. I sobbed. We had bought tickets online via Klook ($1.50 per ticket, scanned the QR code at the museum) and purchased the audio guide at the museum. Afterwards we walked to the Children’s Peace Memorial and Atomic Bomb Dome, and got a late lunch. Because it is an easy 45-50 minute walk through the city, we ended up walking to and from the Shinkansen.

 **\*\*All Airbnb Experiences** (guided tours) were great but shout out to three of them (no particular order) that I LOVED: 1) the Osaka Calligraphy Experience with Ryusho!! He is an excellent instructor and this was an incredibly well run 90 minutes where we learned about the Japanese language, practiced calligraphy, made our art, and ended with tea and dessert. A really special experience!  2) The Temma bar crawl with Taka in Osaka – great guide, great stops/neighborhood that I would not have explored, great food, great people. So happy we did this. 3) The Shinjuku (Golden Gai) bar crawl in Tokyo with Yoshi, who is a PRO at leading these tours, which was beyond excellent (great stops, delicious food, learned a good amount of language and culture, with a fun kind group, and food preferences/restrictions/allergies were well accomodated). Because I don't speak Japanese, these tours are a great way to see parts of the city I wouldn’t have had the confidence to go to, learn about the culture, and for the ones with food, all the food was great (and I tried new foods and drinks). Also, in all of them, I learned and practiced a bit more Japanese!

**\*\*Tokyo: Asakusa Sumo Experience.** Cheesy af, but so much fun. A very well-run two hour experience with all you can eat lunch and one beverage (though you can get more drinks!); the first half you learn a brief history of Sumo, watch a dance by a Geisha, and then watch two Sumo wrestlers demonstrate technique and fighting, which is super exciting. The second half, some members of the crowd “battle” the wrestlers, and this was fun to watch. You get a souvenir bag, picture, sake masu cup, and more. Overall, super great. I booked through getyourguide, but you can also book directly. 

**\*\*Tokyo: Shimokitazawa.** I LOVED staying in this neighborhood. Yes it has all the hipster trappings, but it is vibrant, artsy, and chill and with small, winding streets and a ton of natural wine bars. Some favorite spots include Sidewalk Coffee (in our hotel, open to all, great tea, coffee, and bagels); Izakaya Kushiyaki Niyasai Zeroya (fun lively space with inventive izakaya food); Abill (welcoming cozy wine and food bar); Music Bar RPM (live jazz with modest cover); Counter Bar (great DJs playing hip hop and soul, small welcoming space); Basement Bar (rock bands with cover); and No Room for Squares (speakeasy with jazz music), and the outdoor Odakyu Line Walk. Note you need yen for music venue covers (around Y1000 to Y3500 per person), but most places you could use credit card for drinks. Check websites/insta pages for schedules. I’m not really into thrifting (which Shimokita is known for) but we did so one afternoon, and I found a cute dress at Ragtag and my partner got a jacket at New York Joe. There are two nearby metro stations (about 4 minutes and 10 minutes from our hotel), and the neighborhood is only about 20-25 minutes from Shinjuku, and the farthest on the metro we went was an hour to Asakusa, which wasn’t bad. If I had more in my budget, I’d look to eat at some of the fine dining restaurants in the neighborhood because they looked delicious. Also,  FWIW, I am a Black woman and felt super comfortable in this area. 

HOTELS 

We spent around $3100 total for 10 nights of hotel as prices were elevated at Christmas time and we splurged on the last hotel, but hotel comfort is important to me and we are not big spenders otherwise so this worked within our budget. Booked via hotel(dot)com because I get rewards.

**Super Hotel Premier Yaseu Tokyo** *(1 night, around $200)*. Near Tokyo Station and Ginza, perfect for a one night stay before taking the Shinkansen. Tiny room, but also super efficient and included very cute pajamas! We were too tired to try the free open bar, but it had tons of different liquors and snacks open until 9pm. The in-room pillows were tough for me, but there is a “pillow bar” downstairs to augment this. There is an onsen (including a women-only onsen) as well as laundry here that we did not check out. Ultimately happy we stayed here as it was comfortable and convenient for our travel the next day. 

**Voco Osaka** *(5 nights, around $200/night though there was an extra city fee at check out).* Overwhelmed when looking at Osaka hotels, but because I had a good experience at another Voco before, I decided to try this one. Overall, I liked it and happy we picked this hotel! It’s hip, upscale and welcoming. Our room was gorgeous with terrazzo marble, in room coffee maker, free bottled water everyday, and water stations on each floor, and everything felt new and clean. Tried the breakfast buffet (around $25 pp) twice and it was sooo good I gleefully shrieked, with both Japanese and Western with everything from eggs to order, miso soup with toppings, fish, Japanese veggies, smoothies, salad, waffles, and more. There’s a gym too but no laundry (though they have laundry service). Location was a 40 minute walk north of Dotonbori, and 20 minutes by train from the Shin-Osaka station. It felt quiet/office-y, but nice. Great pajamas that I wore every night! 

**Mustard Hotel Shimokitazawa** *(Tokyo 4 nights, $350 a night – we splurged on a spacious deluxe room with outdoor area but there are much cheaper rooms here starting around $100/night)*. Great, kind staff, great lobby coffee shop, great vibes etc. Has self-serve laundry (the drier wasn’t great but our clothes finished drying in our room). Feels like the center of something fun and staying here comes with discounts to dozens of shops in the neighborhood, including no cover admission to Counter Club bar (which we used!) All rooms have a record player and the lobby has a record lending library. The hotel is more minimal and only cleans every third day (which I didn't love) but you can get towels etc every day. Overall super, super happy we stayed here. Even though this is a “hipster” hotel there were a considerable amount of families staying here. Cute pajamas!

LEARNINGS

**Learn basic Japanese phrases**! I watched a few Tik Tok videos that helped with pronunciation. In Japan, these phrases were useful, and then I sometimes would switch to Google Translate. 

\-Arigatou gozaimasu (“thank you” I said this during/after most interactions!) 

\-Konnichiwa (“hello” or “ goodday”)

\-Konbanwa (“good evening”)

\-Ohio gozaimasu (“good morning,” at the first hotel, the receptionist said this to me in the morning, and then I started to say it to others in the morning)

\-Sumimasen (“excuse me,” “im sorry”; also useful at a restaurant, you can raise your hand and say this to a server)

\-Kore Kudasai (“this please” when pointing to an item)

\-Oishi desu (“its delicious” said after the end of a meal to the chef and/or the host! Everytime I said this, I was greeted with a surprised look of appreciation!)

**Weather/Clothing**. It is very dry in Japan, so bring extra lotion, moisturizer etc. (I have oily skin which got super dry!) Temperature wise late December ranged from high 30s to mid-50s F (3 to 13 C), mostly sunny. Most people wore either a puffer coat or a long wool coat with scarf etc. I brought two pairs of Sorel boots which were comfortable for long walks (anywhere from 10K to 25+K steps a day). Also loved that all our hotels had pajamas! 

**Luggage forwarding vs. carrying luggage.** We didn’t do luggage forwarding and were ok carrying our luggage on public transit; if you’ve done this in other cities (public transit and stairs) you’ll be fine!

**Public transit etiquette.** You can talk on the subway! Just do so at a low volume. Also be mindful of where to lineup, which side of the escalator to stand or pass on (changes in Osaka vs Tokyo). We had a few minor card issues and I would approach the person at the train station with “Konichwa” and then a translation on Google Translate. Often they’d switch to English but it was good to approach in Japanese first. Loved that all the trains and Shinkansen were mostly on time, clean, and had clear signage (though sometimes we got minimally lost but figured it out!)

**Taxis.** We mostly took public transit but took a few taxis when we were running late and took taxis in Kyoto. For taxis, we mostly used the GO app. Here are some Taxi costs.

Osaka Shinsekai to Hotel Y3500 / $23

Roggingi to Shimakitakawa Y4300 / $28

Kyoto Station to Otagi Temple Y6000Yen / $39

Roppingi to Haneda Airport Y8110 / $52

**TeamLabs.** I hope this is helpful if you are thinking about going: I enjoyed Borderless; didn’t go to Planets (seemed cool but farther away and we weren't in the mood to walk barefoot). But the experience feels like candy to me, visually addictive and you get great photos, but there was an emptiness. That said, I’m glad I went. 

**Kyoto is huge!** We only did a day trip and there is so much more I want to see, but a quick reflection: Kyoto is a lot more spread out than Osaka! It seemed like everything took a lot longer. This also might be because of the crowds. Beautiful city, but something to keep in mind. 

**Restaurant recs/reservations (especially in Kyoto).** Leading up, I bookmarked a bunch of places on google maps. The days we got lunch on the fly – that was always easy. But the few times we wanted dinner, it was difficult to find a place, with Kyoto being the toughest. In Kyoto, there were places that wouldn’t serve us because we were foreigners. This was frustrating but I got another POV: one tour guide said this is because some Japanese people care about service and don't want to serve in English if their English isn’t good. That said, in Shimokita we were able to walk in, but they needed the table back in 90 minutes which was ok! I couldn’t figure out the tablelog app, but looking at it now, the Tablelog website works well, so consider using that for dinner reservations. A long way of saying – make dinner reservations (can do day of/hour of) in Kyoto.

**New Year’s Eve in Japan** seems similar to Thanksgiving and Christmas in the US in that most people spend time with family rather than going out. However we met the very kind owner of Abill on an Airbnb Experience; she said her restaurant would be open that night so we went there and had a great time. I also looked at websites/instagram pages of bars in Shimokita and saw that Basement Bar was having a night of bands so we went there afterwards, and then did a toast next door at Coastal where they had a DJ. 

**Money Money Money.** We used total 7000 Yen on each Welcome Suica card (5000 to start and then added 2000), but also took taxis via the GO app a few times. I think if you plan to stay two weeks, 10,000 Yen on each Suica is good. Having 147,000 in Yen worked well for the two of us for 10 days (mostly for food, gifts, and  music venue cover); we also put some things on our cards. We didn’t withdraw any more Yen beyond what we brought!

**Useful apps**.  

\*GO Taxi (set this up before you leave; I put in an Amex). 

\*Google Maps for Transit (though I always added at least 10-15 minutes to suggested commuting time which was useful, also it shows you the cost of rides which was helpful when we were low on funds on our Suica card).

\*Google Translate (which I often used after saying konichiwa). 

\*AirBnB, Getyourgudie, and Klook for booking experiences, tours, and museums. 

\*I have an android (and got the physical Welcome Suica), but my inlaws used their iphones for the Suica card and it worked well. 

\*SmartEx app to book Shinkansen tickets mostly worked very well. We were able to change our Tokyo - Osaka train to an earlier time 30 minutes prior. That said, make sure to screenshot and save your QR codes as soon as you can (ideally a few days before your trip) because the app (and website) were COMPLETELY DOWN during our trip back to Tokyo (on December 28) which caused a huge headache. This wouldn’t have been a problem because I originally printed all QR codes out, but I changed our Shinkansen to an earlier time a few days prior and when I went to get the QR code day of the app was down (busiest travel day of the year and there had been a fire on the track that day so some trains were canceled and people were rebooking so I imagine this overloaded the system). After checking in with staff in Osaka, we were let on the train but needed the QR code to exit at Tokyo Station and that took time but eventually it worked. All to say – **SAVE YOUR SmartEX QR Code when you first receive it and at least 24 hours before your train (especially if traveling on a busy day), and don't rely on the app because it might be down.** 

REFLECTION

Thank you for all your advice – this sub helped so much!! I am grateful for my time in Japan including learning about the Shinto and Buddhist religions, connecting more with Japanese folks and tourists, spending time in nature, commuting via long walks and train (and sometimes taxi). Having great warm toilets. Also eating such delicious food, and learning some Japanese culture, history, and language! Thankful to you all who made our trip beautiful and meaningful. Hope you have a great time in Japan!",2,1735849700.0,JapanTravel,0,1.0,False
1hs3izo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hs3izo/anxiety_with_1_on_1_situations_need/,"Anxiety with 1 on 1 situations, need help/suggestions.","Hello all, I’m a 21 year old suffering from a strange type of social anxiety/fear of the unknown and I need help identifying what is wrong with me or how to get over this hurdle. Please any help will be appreciated, I’m beginning to get incredibly lonely and it doesn’t help the fact that I’m the reason why I feel this way.

Basically, my anxiety is strange, I operate fine in public settings with others around. I’ll use my love life as an example. So in a bar, bowling alley, cinema or just with friends. If there is a girl I like, I can talk to them fine, make them laugh etc. But the problem is, I’ve never been in a relationship because I’m too afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with someone. 

Last year, I had the opportunity of trying to get closer to at least 4-5 women that I met through friends, each time, I knew they liked me, we kissed in pubs, talked when all our friends were with us in bowling alleys etc. But I can absolutely NEVER pluck up the courage to ask one of these girls to go on a “date” or come out to a coffee shop or anywhere alone. Even though I’ve spoken to them before, know we can talk, I have this intense fear that when we are 1 on 1, my mind will go blank or I’ll say something stupid and boom the opportunity is gone. It’s like a fear of not knowing what will happen, not being able to open up etc.

This was fine for the past 2 years, I’ve had a fair share of hookups, afterwards I can speak fine, we have a good time, but then the next day it’s like I have a fear of asking them “Hey, do you want to spend some time together today”. And usually after a while of just texting, they presumably get bored or think I’m just using them for sex, but I’m not I really like them, I’m just scared of what will happen when they get to know me or that my anxiety will kick in and I’ll be awkward.

Like I said, this was fine but it’s taking a toll on my mental health now. People think being able to hookup is nice, it’s not, it feels horrible. I don’t want sex, I want to feel an emotional connection with someone for the first time in my life that goes past bodily pleasure, to be able to spend time with someone I’m comfortable with outside of my childhood guy friends. It’s getting to the point where I’m very lonely and thinking about the “What if I just asked her” and it’s eating me up, because no doubt this year I’ll run into other girls and will probably do the same thing. It was fine for 2 years, but I can’t keep doing this forever or I’ll dig myself into a lonely pit.

Anyone have any advice at all? How do I get over this fear? Am I overthinking too much and should I just shoot my shot if I like a girl and she likes me regardless of my fears? Is there anything I can do to help me slowly get over that hurdle of being afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with people (it doesn’t have to be in a romantic setting).

Here is our trip report (late December 2024)! 



OVERVIEW

Early 40s couple from the US. First time in Japan! We only had the holiday break so we booked a 10ish day trip from December 21 to January 1. I speak no Japanese but learned a few phrases (more below) and picked up some along the way – all super helpful!  I did research on this sub (arigatou gozimasu!) and other subreddits and travel websites (and the dreaded tik tok). Last year I went to South Africa, and loved guided tours from Airbnb Experiences and Getyourguide, so I also looked at those platforms for ideas/tours. We’re into art, food, music, museums, history, nature, nightlife, and like to walk a lot. 



PREP

Prior to entering Japan, we got Y147,000 ($1000), set up the GO app for taxi transit (worked really well), filled out VisitJapan and saved the QR codes, booked experiences, purchased Shinkansen tickets via the SmartEx app and saved the QR codes (and printed them). Set up Whatsapp to communicate with friends and family. 

We each packed a carryon and backpack, with an extra soft bag inside for anticipated gift purchases. I purchased two power converters from Amazon, each one held plugs and usb drives. Also brought Emergen-C packs which we took everyday. 

For internet, we used the Verizon $12/day travel pass which worked well as I stupidly couldn’t figure out how to setup an esim. Daily in Japan, I carried around a small crossbody purse with passport, AmEx, Welcome Suica card, and Yen, and other essentials, often battery packs for our phones. 



DAY BY DAY

(1 night Tokyo, 5 nights Osaka, 4 nights Tokyo)

**Sunday, December 22** ***(Tokyo)*****:**

Early morning walk to Tsukiji Market and explore and eat! Walk back, and then take 10AM Shinkansen to Osaka. Metro to hotel (Voco Osaka). Evening: walk through Dotonbori (omg so crowded) and then guided tour of retro Shinsekai (Airbnb Experience).

Delicious breakfast buffet at hotel. Metro to JR line to Kyoto. Beautiful morning in Arashiyama: Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple, followed by a walk to Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street, Sagano Bamboo Grove, tasty lunch at Arashiyama Tenryu Ramen, and then Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama. Afternoon with inlaws (who were also in Japan) walking the Philosophers Path. Very frustrating dinner experience in Kyoto where we kept getting rejected at empty restaurants (one was about to seat us and then the manager shooed us away), and then got super rude and unsanitary service at a restaurant that finally accepted us. JR/Metro back to hotel. 

**Friday, December 27** ***(morning day trip to Nara; evening bar crawl of Temma, Osaka):*** 

Metro (Kintetsu line) to majestic Nara: Deer Park, Todai-ji Namdaimon Temple (biggest seated Buddha in Japan), Kasugataisha Shrine (learned the Saisen prayer coin toss), and had mochi and lunch on Sanjo Dori Street. Got beautiful gifts in the stunning Nakagawa Masashichi Shoten store. Metro back to Osaka. Metro to evening Airbnb Experience of Temma Osaka – great locations and super fun! Ended night at karaoke with our new tour besties.

**Saturday, December, 28 (*****Osaka to Tokyo)***

Metro to Shin-Osaka. Frustrating but ultimately ok Shinkansen travel to Tokyo on the busiest travel day of the year(!!). Metro to hotel (Hotel Mustard Shimokitazawa). Super fun Shinjuku bar tour of Omoide Yokocho and Golden Gai (Airbnb Experience).

**Sunday, December 29** ***(Tokyo):*** 

Bagels at Sidewalk Coffee at hotel. Early morning gift shopping (matcha, face masks, and more!) at Donki in Shimokita, and lunch at Kitade Tacos (they were good)!

Metro back to Shimokita where we did some vintage shopping and got a delicious dinner at Izakaya Kushiyaki Niyasai Zeroya. 

**Tuesday, December 31 (*****Tokyo)***

Metro to Asakusa, walk through Nakamise-Dori Shopping Street to Senso-ji Temple (felt like a pilgrimage as this is the most visited religious site in the world!) Walk to nearby Asakusa Sumo Experience (super fun, more below) which included lunch. Walk to Kappabashi Kitchen Street; realized the knives are super cool but out of our price range! Walk to Ueuo Park (loved) and then Akihabara (hated). Train to Shibuya Crossing (did time lapse video) and then walk to Yoyogi Park (we wanted to go to Meiji Shrine but went the wrong way in the park; it was beautiful at dusk so all good!) Train back to Shimokita where we got dinner at Abill (one of the few places open, and they had the NYE Japanese TV program on with famous musicians, actors, and comedians, which was cool to watch!), and then went to a fun, crowded rock show at Basement Bar and New Year’s toast next door at Coaster Craft Beer & Kitchen. Walk back to hotel.

**Wednesday, January 1 (*****Tokyo and depart)***

GO Taki with luggage to meet up with inlaws in Roppongi, get lunch, and then GO taxi to Haneda.



LOVES

**\*\*Kyoto: Arashiyama, especially Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple!** We had a beautiful time in Arashiyama. Because we were staying in Osaka, we took the metro/JR line to Kyoto Station and then a cab (there was a sign saying “foreigner friendly cabs”) to Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple. We said “Ohio Gozaiamasu” to the taxi driver which created a lot of goodwill and he pointed out places on our cab ride there (Y6000). The big highlight was Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple. Go here! It’s green, hilly, and full of hundreds of sculptures with fascinating faces. Originally built in 766, the hundreds of sculptures were added starting in the 1950s. The area is peaceful. After leaving the temple, there is a walkway towards the right that we walked down and had the most beautiful day! We walked by a quaint coffee shop (and got coffee and Chai), more temples, gift shops, beautiful homes, several Bamboo groves, before going to downtown Arashiyama where we got ramen at Arashiyama Tenryu Ramen. We loved this walk; it started so peacefully with few folks and then got more crowded as we got closer to the downtown area. We continued our peaceful walk across the bridge (and there are paddle boats you can rent!) and went to Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama. I love this park. It’s a 20 minute hike (I was huffing and puffing but fine) to the top of the hill, and then you get to be near the monkeys who run wild and you have a beautiful view of Kyoto. A stunning day. 

**\*\*Tokyo: Tsukiji Fish Market.** I know it’s a “tourist trap” but we had a great time. Walked here on our first morning around 7am and ate delicious Wagyu skewers, sashimi, grilled mochi, and more. 

**\*\*Hiroshima: Peace Memorial Museum.** Profound and devastating, it’s vital to know this history and to remember the people who died and lived throughout this time. I sobbed. We had bought tickets online via Klook ($1.50 per ticket, scanned the QR code at the museum) and purchased the audio guide at the museum. Afterwards we walked to the Children’s Peace Memorial and Atomic Bomb Dome, and got a late lunch. Because it is an easy 45-50 minute walk through the city, we ended up walking to and from the Shinkansen.

 **\*\*All Airbnb Experiences** (guided tours) were great but shout out to three of them (no particular order) that I LOVED: 1) the Osaka Calligraphy Experience with Ryusho!! He is an excellent instructor and this was an incredibly well run 90 minutes where we learned about the Japanese language, practiced calligraphy, made our art, and ended with tea and dessert. A really special experience!  2) The Temma bar crawl with Taka in Osaka – great guide, great stops/neighborhood that I would not have explored, great food, great people. So happy we did this. 3) The Shinjuku (Golden Gai) bar crawl in Tokyo with Yoshi, who is a PRO at leading these tours, which was beyond excellent (great stops, delicious food, learned a good amount of language and culture, with a fun kind group, and food preferences/restrictions/allergies were well accomodated). Because I don't speak Japanese, these tours are a great way to see parts of the city I wouldn’t have had the confidence to go to, learn about the culture, and for the ones with food, all the food was great (and I tried new foods and drinks). Also, in all of them, I learned and practiced a bit more Japanese!

**\*\*Tokyo: Asakusa Sumo Experience.** Cheesy af, but so much fun. A very well-run two hour experience with all you can eat lunch and one beverage (though you can get more drinks!); the first half you learn a brief history of Sumo, watch a dance by a Geisha, and then watch two Sumo wrestlers demonstrate technique and fighting, which is super exciting. The second half, some members of the crowd “battle” the wrestlers, and this was fun to watch. You get a souvenir bag, picture, sake masu cup, and more. Overall, super great. I booked through getyourguide, but you can also book directly. 

**\*\*Tokyo: Shimokitazawa.** I LOVED staying in this neighborhood. Yes it has all the hipster trappings, but it is vibrant, artsy, and chill and with small, winding streets and a ton of natural wine bars. Some favorite spots include Sidewalk Coffee (in our hotel, open to all, great tea, coffee, and bagels); Izakaya Kushiyaki Niyasai Zeroya (fun lively space with inventive izakaya food); Abill (welcoming cozy wine and food bar); Music Bar RPM (live jazz with modest cover); Counter Bar (great DJs playing hip hop and soul, small welcoming space); Basement Bar (rock bands with cover); and No Room for Squares (speakeasy with jazz music), and the outdoor Odakyu Line Walk. Note you need yen for music venue covers (around Y1000 to Y3500 per person), but most places you could use credit card for drinks. Check websites/insta pages for schedules. I’m not really into thrifting (which Shimokita is known for) but we did so one afternoon, and I found a cute dress at Ragtag and my partner got a jacket at New York Joe. There are two nearby metro stations (about 4 minutes and 10 minutes from our hotel), and the neighborhood is only about 20-25 minutes from Shinjuku, and the farthest on the metro we went was an hour to Asakusa, which wasn’t bad. If I had more in my budget, I’d look to eat at some of the fine dining restaurants in the neighborhood because they looked delicious. Also,  FWIW, I am a Black woman and felt super comfortable in this area. 



HOTELS 

We spent around $3100 total for 10 nights of hotel as prices were elevated at Christmas time and we splurged on the last hotel, but hotel comfort is important to me and we are not big spenders otherwise so this worked within our budget. Booked via hotel(dot)com because I get rewards.

**Super Hotel Premier Yaseu Tokyo** *(1 night, around $200)*. Near Tokyo Station and Ginza, perfect for a one night stay before taking the Shinkansen. Tiny room, but also super efficient and included very cute pajamas! We were too tired to try the free open bar, but it had tons of different liquors and snacks open until 9pm. The in-room pillows were tough for me, but there is a “pillow bar” downstairs to augment this. There is an onsen (including a women-only onsen) as well as laundry here that we did not check out. Ultimately happy we stayed here as it was comfortable and convenient for our travel the next day. 

**Voco Osaka** *(5 nights, around $200/night though there was an extra city fee at check out).* Overwhelmed when looking at Osaka hotels, but because I had a good experience at another Voco before, I decided to try this one. Overall, I liked it and happy we picked this hotel! It’s hip, upscale and welcoming. Our room was gorgeous with terrazzo marble, in room coffee maker, free bottled water everyday, and water stations on each floor, and everything felt new and clean. Tried the breakfast buffet (around $25 pp) twice and it was sooo good I gleefully shrieked, with both Japanese and Western with everything from eggs to order, miso soup with toppings, fish, Japanese veggies, smoothies, salad, waffles, and more. There’s a gym too but no laundry (though they have laundry service). Location was a 40 minute walk north of Dotonbori, and 20 minutes by train from the Shin-Osaka station. It felt quiet/office-y, but nice. Great pajamas that I wore every night! 

**Mustard Hotel Shimokitazawa** *(Tokyo 4 nights, $350 a night – we splurged on a spacious deluxe room with outdoor area but there are much cheaper rooms here starting around $100/night)*. Great, kind staff, great lobby coffee shop, great vibes etc. Has self-serve laundry (the drier wasn’t great but our clothes finished drying in our room). Feels like the center of something fun and staying here comes with discounts to dozens of shops in the neighborhood, including no cover admission to Counter Club bar (which we used!) All rooms have a record player and the lobby has a record lending library. The hotel is more minimal and only cleans every third day (which I didn't love) but you can get towels etc every day. Overall super, super happy we stayed here. Even though this is a “hipster” hotel there were a considerable amount of families staying here. Cute pajamas!



LEARNINGS

**Learn basic Japanese phrases**! I watched a few Tik Tok videos that helped with pronunciation. In Japan, these phrases were useful, and then I sometimes would switch to Google Translate. 

\-Arigatou gozaimasu (“thank you” I said this during/after most interactions!) 

\-Konnichiwa (“hello” or “ goodday”)

\-Konbanwa (“good evening”)

\-Ohio gozaimasu (“good morning,” at the first hotel, the receptionist said this to me in the morning, and then I started to say it to others in the morning)

\-Sumimasen (“excuse me,” “im sorry”; also useful at a restaurant, you can raise your hand and say this to a server)

\-Kore Kudasai (“this please” when pointing to an item)

\-Oishi desu (“its delicious” said after the end of a meal to the chef and/or the host! Everytime I said this, I was greeted with a surprised look of appreciation!)

**Weather/Clothing**. It is very dry in Japan, so bring extra lotion, moisturizer etc. (I have oily skin which got super dry!) Temperature wise late December ranged from high 30s to mid-50s F (3 to 13 C), mostly sunny. Most people wore either a puffer coat or a long wool coat with scarf etc. I brought two pairs of Sorel boots which were comfortable for long walks (anywhere from 10K to 25+K steps a day). Also loved that all our hotels had pajamas! 

**Luggage forwarding vs. carrying luggage.** We didn’t do luggage forwarding and were ok carrying our luggage on public transit; if you’ve done this in other cities (public transit and stairs) you’ll be fine!

**Public transit etiquette.** You can talk on the subway! Just do so at a low volume. Also be mindful of where to lineup, which side of the escalator to stand or pass on (changes in Osaka vs Tokyo). We had a few minor card issues and I would approach the person at the train station with “Konichwa” and then a translation on Google Translate. Often they’d switch to English but it was good to approach in Japanese first. Loved that all the trains and Shinkansen were mostly on time, clean, and had clear signage (though sometimes we got minimally lost but figured it out!)

**Taxis.** We mostly took public transit but took a few taxis when we were running late and took taxis in Kyoto. For taxis, we mostly used the GO app. Here are some Taxi costs.

Osaka Shinsekai to Hotel Y3500 / $23

Roggingi to Shimakitakawa Y4300 / $28

Kyoto Station to Otagi Temple Y6000Yen / $39

Roppingi to Haneda Airport Y8110 / $52

**TeamLabs.** I hope this is helpful if you are thinking about going: I enjoyed Borderless; didn’t go to Planets (seemed cool but farther away and we weren't in the mood to walk barefoot). But the experience feels like candy to me, visually addictive and you get great photos, but there was an emptiness. That said, I’m glad I went. 

**Kyoto is huge!** We only did a day trip and there is so much more I want to see, but a quick reflection: Kyoto is a lot more spread out than Osaka! It seemed like everything took a lot longer. This also might be because of the crowds. Beautiful city, but something to keep in mind. 

**Restaurant recs/reservations (especially in Kyoto).** Leading up, I bookmarked a bunch of places on google maps. The days we got lunch on the fly – that was always easy. But the few times we wanted dinner, it was difficult to find a place, with Kyoto being the toughest. In Kyoto, there were places that wouldn’t serve us because we were foreigners. This was frustrating but I got another POV: one tour guide said this is because some Japanese people care about service and don't want to serve in English if their English isn’t good. That said, in Shimokita we were able to walk in, but they needed the table back in 90 minutes which was ok! I couldn’t figure out the tablelog app, but looking at it now, the Tablelog website works well, so consider using that for dinner reservations. A long way of saying – make dinner reservations (can do day of/hour of) in Kyoto.

**New Year’s Eve in Japan** seems similar to Thanksgiving and Christmas in the US in that most people spend time with family rather than going out. However we met the very kind owner of Abill on an Airbnb Experience; she said her restaurant would be open that night so we went there and had a great time. I also looked at websites/instagram pages of bars in Shimokita and saw that Basement Bar was having a night of bands so we went there afterwards, and then did a toast next door at Coastal where they had a DJ. 

**Money Money Money.** We used total 7000 Yen on each Welcome Suica card (5000 to start and then added 2000), but also took taxis via the GO app a few times. I think if you plan to stay two weeks, 10,000 Yen on each Suica is good. Having 147,000 in Yen worked well for the two of us for 10 days (mostly for food, gifts, and  music venue cover); we also put some things on our cards. We didn’t withdraw any more Yen beyond what we brought!

**Useful apps**.  

\*GO Taxi (set this up before you leave; I put in an Amex). 

\*Google Maps for Transit (though I always added at least 10-15 minutes to suggested commuting time which was useful, also it shows you the cost of rides which was helpful when we were low on funds on our Suica card).

\*Google Translate (which I often used after saying konichiwa). 

\*AirBnB, Getyourgudie, and Klook for booking experiences, tours, and museums. 

\*I have an android (and got the physical Welcome Suica), but my inlaws used their iphones for the Suica card and it worked well. 

\*SmartEx app to book Shinkansen tickets mostly worked very well. We were able to change our Tokyo - Osaka train to an earlier time 30 minutes prior. That said, make sure to screenshot and save your QR codes as soon as you can (ideally a few days before your trip) because the app (and website) were COMPLETELY DOWN during our trip back to Tokyo (on December 28) which caused a huge headache. This wouldn’t have been a problem because I originally printed all QR codes out, but I changed our Shinkansen to an earlier time a few days prior and when I went to get the QR code day of the app was down (busiest travel day of the year and there had been a fire on the track that day so some trains were canceled and people were rebooking so I imagine this overloaded the system). After checking in with staff in Osaka, we were let on the train but needed the QR code to exit at Tokyo Station and that took time but eventually it worked. All to say – **SAVE YOUR SmartEX QR Code when you first receive it and at least 24 hours before your train (especially if traveling on a busy day), and don't rely on the app because it might be down.** 



REFLECTION

Thank you for all your advice – this sub helped so much!! I am grateful for my time in Japan including learning about the Shinto and Buddhist religions, connecting more with Japanese folks and tourists, spending time in nature, commuting via long walks and train (and sometimes taxi). Having great warm toilets. Also eating such delicious food, and learning some Japanese culture, history, and language! Thankful to you all who made our trip beautiful and meaningful. Hope you have a great time in Japan!

1hs3dw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1hs3dw3/betterme_alkaline_diet_food_list/,BetterMe: Alkaline Diet Food List,"# What is the Alkaline Diet?

The alkaline diet is based on the idea that certain foods affect the pH levels in your body. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14:

* **Below 7** = Acidic
* **7** = Neutral
* **Above 7** = Alkaline (basic)

The diet encourages eating alkaline foods (foods that have a pH higher than 7) and limiting acid-forming foods (foods that have a pH lower than 7). While the scientific community disagrees with the claim that diet can change your blood’s pH levels (your body regulates that), the diet focuses on eating more plant-based foods that are generally rich in nutrients and low in processed ingredients.

# The Core Idea

The main goal of the diet is to focus on foods that may help balance the body’s acidity levels and support better health. The theory is that eating more alkaline foods can reduce acidity in your body, leading to benefits like improved digestion, less inflammation, and even a lower risk of chronic diseases.

# Key Food Categories

1. **Alkaline Foods**: These foods are considered to have a pH above 7 and are said to help balance the body’s natural pH.
   * **Highly Alkaline**: Sea vegetables (like kelp and seaweed), cucumber, spinach, kale, parsley, broccoli, and sprouts.
   * **Moderately Alkaline**: Avocados, cabbage, celery, ginger, garlic, lemon, lime, tomatoes, quinoa, and sweet potatoes.
   * **Mildly Alkaline**: Asparagus, cauliflower, carrots, peas, grapefruit, coconut, tofu, buckwheat, and almonds.
2. **Acid-Forming Foods**: These foods are typically considered to have a pH below 7 and can increase acidity in the body.
   * **Highly Acidic**: Meat (beef, lamb, pork), poultry, dairy (milk, cheese), coffee, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners.
   * **Moderately Acidic**: Fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges, along with grains like whole wheat and rice.
   * **Neutral/Mildly Acidic**: Foods like beans, nuts, grains (spelt, oats), and some fruits like cantaloupe and nectarines.
3. **Neutral Foods**: These don’t heavily affect the body’s pH and include plant-based fats, starches, and sugars.

# Health Benefits

While there’s no scientific proof that the alkaline diet changes your body's pH, here are some potential benefits of following this eating plan:

* **Weight Loss**: Alkaline foods like fruits and vegetables tend to be lower in calories than animal-based and processed foods, making it easier to maintain or lose weight.
* **Improved Heart Health**: A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can help reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
* **Lower Cancer Risk**: Though the alkaline diet itself doesn't prevent cancer, eating more plant-based foods and fewer processed ones can reduce the risk due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
* **Better Digestion**: A high intake of fiber from alkaline foods supports digestive health, reduces bloating, and helps prevent constipation.

❔❔ What’s your favorite alkaline food, and how do you incorporate it into your meals? Share your ideas and let’s inspire each other! 🌱✨

Hey all! I just put out an MCP server that integrates with Stability AI - generate and manipulate image files with the latest and greatest Stable Diffusion models.

It’s built to be easy-to-use: no need for a deep understanding of image models and how to wrangle them. Just prompt things like “generate me an image of a living room” and then “replace that wooden coffee table with a stone coffee table”.

Features: generate image, remove background, outpaint (uncrop), search & replace, upscale, sketch to image. More to come.

","Hello all, I’m a 21 year old suffering from a strange type of social anxiety/fear of the unknown and I need help identifying what is wrong with me or how to get over this hurdle. Please any help will be appreciated, I’m beginning to get incredibly lonely and it doesn’t help the fact that I’m the reason why I feel this way.

Basically, my anxiety is strange, I operate fine in public settings with others around. I’ll use my love life as an example. So in a bar, bowling alley, cinema or just with friends. If there is a girl I like, I can talk to them fine, make them laugh etc. But the problem is, I’ve never been in a relationship because I’m too afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with someone. 

Last year, I had the opportunity of trying to get closer to at least 4-5 women that I met through friends, each time, I knew they liked me, we kissed in pubs, talked when all our friends were with us in bowling alleys etc. But I can absolutely NEVER pluck up the courage to ask one of these girls to go on a “date” or come out to a coffee shop or anywhere alone. Even though I’ve spoken to them before, know we can talk, I have this intense fear that when we are 1 on 1, my mind will go blank or I’ll say something stupid and boom the opportunity is gone. It’s like a fear of not knowing what will happen, not being able to open up etc.

This was fine for the past 2 years, I’ve had a fair share of hookups, afterwards I can speak fine, we have a good time, but then the next day it’s like I have a fear of asking them “Hey, do you want to spend some time together today”. And usually after a while of just texting, they presumably get bored or think I’m just using them for sex, but I’m not I really like them, I’m just scared of what will happen when they get to know me or that my anxiety will kick in and I’ll be awkward.

Like I said, this was fine but it’s taking a toll on my mental health now. People think being able to hookup is nice, it’s not, it feels horrible. I don’t want sex, I want to feel an emotional connection with someone for the first time in my life that goes past bodily pleasure, to be able to spend time with someone I’m comfortable with outside of my childhood guy friends. It’s getting to the point where I’m very lonely and thinking about the “What if I just asked her” and it’s eating me up, because no doubt this year I’ll run into other girls and will probably do the same thing. It was fine for 2 years, but I can’t keep doing this forever or I’ll dig myself into a lonely pit.

Anyone have any advice at all? How do I get over this fear? Am I overthinking too much and should I just shoot my shot if I like a girl and she likes me regardless of my fears? Is there anything I can do to help me slowly get over that hurdle of being afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with people (it doesn’t have to be in a romantic setting).

1hs39xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hs39xv/anxiety_with_1_on_1_situations_need/,"Anxiety with 1 on 1 situations, need help/suggestions.","Hello all, I’m a 21 year old suffering from a strange type of social anxiety/fear of the unknown and I need help identifying what is wrong with me or how to get over this hurdle. Please any help will be appreciated, I’m beginning to get incredibly lonely and it doesn’t help the fact that I’m the reason why I feel this way.

Basically, my anxiety is strange, I operate fine in public settings with others around. I’ll use my love life as an example. So in a bar, bowling alley, cinema or just with friends. If there is a girl I like, I can talk to them fine, make them laugh etc. But the problem is, I’ve never been in a relationship because I’m too afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with someone. 

Last year, I had the opportunity of trying to get closer to at least 4-5 women that I met through friends, each time, I knew they liked me, we kissed in pubs, talked when all our friends were with us in bowling alleys etc. But I can absolutely NEVER pluck up the courage to ask one of these girls to go on a “date” or come out to a coffee shop or anywhere alone. Even though I’ve spoken to them before, know we can talk, I have this intense fear that when we are 1 on 1, my mind will go blank or I’ll say something stupid and boom the opportunity is gone. It’s like a fear of not knowing what will happen, not being able to open up etc.

This was fine for the past 2 years, I’ve had a fair share of hookups, afterwards I can speak fine, we have a good time, but then the next day it’s like I have a fear of asking them “Hey, do you want to spend some time together today”. And usually after a while of just texting, they presumably get bored or think I’m just using them for sex, but I’m not I really like them, I’m just scared of what will happen when they get to know me or that my anxiety will kick in and I’ll be awkward.

Like I said, this was fine but it’s taking a toll on my mental health now. People think being able to hookup is nice, it’s not, it feels horrible. I don’t want sex, I want to feel an emotional connection with someone for the first time in my life that goes past bodily pleasure, to be able to spend time with someone I’m comfortable with outside of my childhood guy friends. It’s getting to the point where I’m very lonely and thinking about the “What if I just asked her” and it’s eating me up, because no doubt this year I’ll run into other girls and will probably do the same thing. It was fine for 2 years, but I can’t keep doing this forever or I’ll dig myself into a lonely pit.

Anyone have any advice at all? How do I get over this fear? Am I overthinking too much and should I just shoot my shot if I like a girl and she likes me regardless of my fears? Is there anything I can do to help me slowly get over that hurdle of being afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with people (it doesn’t have to be in a romantic setting).

1hs38so,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1hs38so/anxiety_with_1_on_1_situations_need/,"Anxiety with 1 on 1 situations, need help/suggestions.","Hello all, I’m a 21 year old suffering from a strange type of social anxiety/fear of the unknown and I need help identifying what is wrong with me or how to get over this hurdle. Please any help will be appreciated, I’m beginning to get incredibly lonely and it doesn’t help the fact that I’m the reason why I feel this way.

Basically, my anxiety is strange, I operate fine in public settings with others around. I’ll use my love life as an example. So in a bar, bowling alley, cinema or just with friends. If there is a girl I like, I can talk to them fine, make them laugh etc. But the problem is, I’ve never been in a relationship because I’m too afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with someone. 

Last year, I had the opportunity of trying to get closer to at least 4-5 women that I met through friends, each time, I knew they liked me, we kissed in pubs, talked when all our friends were with us in bowling alleys etc. But I can absolutely NEVER pluck up the courage to ask one of these girls to go on a “date” or come out to a coffee shop or anywhere alone. Even though I’ve spoken to them before, know we can talk, I have this intense fear that when we are 1 on 1, my mind will go blank or I’ll say something stupid and boom the opportunity is gone. It’s like a fear of not knowing what will happen, not being able to open up etc.

This was fine for the past 2 years, I’ve had a fair share of hookups, afterwards I can speak fine, we have a good time, but then the next day it’s like I have a fear of asking them “Hey, do you want to spend some time together today”. And usually after a while of just texting, they presumably get bored or think I’m just using them for sex, but I’m not I really like them, I’m just scared of what will happen when they get to know me or that my anxiety will kick in and I’ll be awkward.

Like I said, this was fine but it’s taking a toll on my mental health now. People think being able to hookup is nice, it’s not, it feels horrible. I don’t want sex, I want to feel an emotional connection with someone for the first time in my life that goes past bodily pleasure, to be able to spend time with someone I’m comfortable with outside of my childhood guy friends. It’s getting to the point where I’m very lonely and thinking about the “What if I just asked her” and it’s eating me up, because no doubt this year I’ll run into other girls and will probably do the same thing. It was fine for 2 years, but I can’t keep doing this forever or I’ll dig myself into a lonely pit.

Anyone have any advice at all? How do I get over this fear? Am I overthinking too much and should I just shoot my shot if I like a girl and she likes me regardless of my fears? Is there anything I can do to help me slowly get over that hurdle of being afraid to spend 1 on 1 time with people (it doesn’t have to be in a romantic setting).

1hs33y3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xennials/comments/1hs33y3/dave_mathews_band_cluster_fck/,Dave Mathews Band Cluster F@ck,"Inspired by the recent DMB conversation. I've shared this story with friends and colleagues but never publicly. In 2007 I was working for K2 (the ski / snowboard company) in Seattle and living in Ballard. 

Early on a Sunday in February I was heading up to Alpental to ride. It was early in the morning, about 7:30 and still dark outside. It was a cold overcast day with steady drizzle. The rest of the city was still sleeping and there wasn't anyone on the road. 

To get to the highway from Ballard I took Market st to 45n... Passing Wallingford's little downtown area. I was being cautious, driving the speed limit at 30 mph, listening to Wolf Parade and enjoying the silence of the sleepy, dark, rainy city. 

Just as I was about to pass Fuel Coffee on 45 a guy in a trenchcoat carrying a big tray of coffee walked right in front of my car. I slammed on the breaks, honked my horn and skidded to a stop about 2 feet in front of this guy. 

We lock eyes and he starts screaming at me, telling me to F-Off and that I almost killed him. I froze and then it hit me. This asshole that just walked out in front of me... was none other than Dave Mathews... As soon as I realized who it was the only thing I could think to say was ""F-me? No, F-you Dave Mathews... I have the right of way... There isn't a cross walk here and there isn't another car on the road... Wait your turn you ahole"" 

He continued to scream at me so I did the only logical thing I could do in that situation and told him his music sucks and that Eddie Vedder would have the common sense and decency to not walk in front of a car when it's dark and rainy.

We eventually went on our separate ways. Every time I hear a DMB song I can't help but think, for a split moment the future of our lives was intertwined and how it would have been a very different outcome had I been driving faster or not paying attention. I can't imagine having my life ruined all because Dave Mathews doesn't know how to look both ways before crossing the street.

•How I got it (Traumatic): I loved listening to music on bassy headphones with the volume so high until one time I heard loud ringing noises like bells and whistles in my ears for 5 minutes straight then it went away but when I went to sleep I started hearing constant loud ringing noise in my right ear about 7/10

•First 2-3 weeks (Hell): I was so angry, anxious, I could barely sleep as the ringing was so loud, I was so suicidal and I started hitting myself out of anger and guilt as I knew tinnitus is mostly irreversible damage. I want to also add that I started to habituate to the noise after 3/4 months.

•Seeking help: I visited 2 ENT specialists and an audiologist. They had me do a Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA), Tympanometry, Ear CT (Petrous bone CT) and great neck vessels ultrasound.

•The results: they all came back normal, no problems in both ears or my listening but my ENT doctor concluded from the ultrasound that I have high blood pressure in my right carotid artery so this was apparently the cause of my tinnitus according to him.

•Now: so after 1 year, my brain has habituated to the noise so well it doesn't bother me as much as before and I can only hear the noise when the room is quiet or when I'm sleeping and it's now 2-3/10. Sometimes the noise increases when I'm tired/didn't sleep well/drank too much coffee but other than that my brain usually ignores the noise and I got back to listening to music again but the volume has a certain limit now unfortunately 😔

The only thing I truly miss is hearing the dead silence like before as I'm a quiet person and easily irritated by noise so maybe next year I hope I'll be fully recovered and so do you guys.

Thanks for reading and I wish you the best and complete recovery ❤
