And I swear the people who complain the loudest are the ones who already had near-perfect teeth and are just “tweaking” their smile.

What really sends me is when they’ll openly admit they don’t wear their trays for days or even a whole week, lose them, drink coffee with them in, and then hop online to whine about pain, slow progress, or their treatment getting extended. Like... you are the problem.

Yes, Invisalign is uncomfortable. Yes, it’s annoying sometimes. Nobody said it was a spa day. But for those of us who’ve spent years hiding our smile or feeling insecure about our teeth, this is literally a tiny price to pay. 

The constant “Invisalign is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me” posts from people with 10 trays who started with almost perfect teeth are so eye-roll inducing. Some of us are actually grateful to even have the option to fix genuinely messed-up teeth. Perspective is free.",1,1770287531.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False
1qwhuaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1qwhuaz/disagreement_with_mil/,Disagreement with MIL,"Specifically revolving my parenting.

I wouldn't ask her advice on parenting and I don't. I don't even like how she raised my husband but I love him despite it. Her son, my husband, isn't her biological child. She never wanted kids and never been pregnant, wasn't a sahm.

This is her long term partners child. There's already a bunch of unrealatbility there. While you can be knowledgeable on pregnancy such as doctor it's very different from experiencing.

My toddler son and I are doing an extended stay, and I'm soon to give birth. It's been 2/4 months.

I'm planning on not speaking to her after this experience due to a recent disagreement.

I'm here while my husband is deployed. I was initially with my relatives, but due to some martial issues prior to deployment they view my husband differently and indirectly expressed not wanting him to stay in their house for the 3 weeks he's been approved to come back for the birth.

I made this decision in November to fly to my inlaws so my husband would have a place to stay while visiting. I'm living with relatives for the financial benefit (paying off credit card debt). If it was absolutely necessary I could go back to the military base. Both parties (my family and his) offered me to come stay with them while he's deployed.

In December I flew with my son for free before he turned 2 in January. My husband's side of the family is experiencing my son for the first or second time since he was 4 months old, we celebrated Christmas, his bday, the plan is for them to see the new baby, and my husband can see his family as well. I did this for my husband. He didn't ask for this but I was being courteous. I know how he feels about feeling excluded from his family and our home state and we live near my family and our son is experiencing my side more.

Today we got into a verbal disagreement. She asked if I had anything I wanted to say. Basically everything she's been thinking came out opposed to me I held my true thoughts to myself out of respect. She just told me all the negatives of how she views me as a mom. I personally don't think she did any better. This isn't the first time she's passed comments. When my husband would call and confide in her she always sided with him. Literally when the issue at hand was his fault. She doesn't say much, she minds her business for the most part, but when she does I'm never pleased.

I don't talk on the phone often but she mentioned "" I don't know who you be talking to on the phone.""

I told her who and I told her ""I call people I know and trust to seek advice from.""

She says, ""we will see who you trust and where they will be when the baby gets here."" She also told me, ""don't underestimate her because she only has 1 kid.""

She said goodnight after those last statements and though I'm 36wks pregnant and shouldn't be flying I'm not comfortable with her being my emergency contact while in labor and my husband isn't reliable due to him being deployed. He does have a set date but he can't do anything unless he's here.

Its likely I would be in labor alone due to grandparents watching my son, and some other relatives needing to work.

I don't feel comfortable anymore and I compromised for my husband and his family. My MIL doesn't know the real reason I'm here. (About my family not wanting my husband to stay at their home) I just made it seem like I'm visiting for her grandchildren and son. I compromised and I feel like it won't even be appreciated for it.

I need to do what's best for my kids and I. I care about my husband but it'll have to just be unfortunate for him not see the birth and see his family like I planned. My sanity is more important. I have to worry about myself not him when he's in another country. I feel my MIL has the best interest in the kids and not necessarily me. She cares about me because I'm married into the family and kids. Whereas worst case scenario I rather be back with my family and have them as an emergency contact. They also know how to manage my son better.

My MIL is a smoker, she smokes outside due to us being here. The way she changes diapers is questionable, I understand it's been a while but sheesh, what she feeds my child when I'm gone is smh, and I know she won't be able to put him to sleep for a nap or bedtime, bath time, brush his hair, and brush his teeth. Who's going to do this for the days I'm in the hospital? She also doesn't want up early. My son wakes up between 5:30am-7. She wakes up near noon and needs to smoke n drink coffee first.

She's just fun with no discipline. My son doesn't take her serious. He wants to play with her not listen. Because of the smoking and no listening idk how a smoker will operate when they don't get to smoke. She doesn't watch him 24/7.

I'm strict as far as nap and bed time being within a certain time, and I don't let my son do the things he wants like throwing his toys, beating certain things. Making him sit and eat opposed to letting him eat and run away, come back and eat. He doesn't eat super healthy but I don't want him having many sweets and she always talking about dessert and treats. My husband had cavities growing up. My MIL says their teeth are going to fall out anyways. Such an ignorant thing to say. Why would I care less about his teeth because they're going to fall out? If he did get cavities and cause him to go threw dental pain.

My MIL is free spirited and says he's only 2. That's true but you have to teach them young. My son understands, obviously doesn't know everything. If you let him get away with it he will do it. That's even with adults",1,1770287530.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

	•	Durability and longevity over absolute grind precision

For the first few months it really was like that. People nodded in the hallway, the loudest sound was somebody doing laundry at 8 pm. Then a new tenant moved into the apartment right below mine, a woman in her late 20s with a loud laugh and even louder friends. At first it was kind of nice watching her make the balcony look cute with fairy lights and plants. I work from home a few days a week, so I thought it would be nice to see some life out there instead of the empty concrete. I did not realize that some life would turn into a full time social club under my windows. She smokes on that balcony constantly. Morning coffee smoke, after work wine smoke, stress smoke during calls, random midnight smoke where the only thing I hear is a lighter and then her voice. The smoke goes straight into my living room and bedroom. I wake up some mornings and it already smells like I fell asleep in a cheap bar. When I close the windows it gets hot and stuffy, when I open them my eyes start to sting. On top of that she has a bluetooth speaker that never goes above medium volume but it is always there. Not a big party, just a constant soundtrack of pop remixes and true crime while she and her friends dissect everyone they work with. I know more about Nicole from accounting than Nicole’s therapist.



I tried to be polite first. I baked cookies when she moved in, we chatted in the stairwell, I mentioned that smoke travels weirdly in the building and asked if she could maybe use the far corner of the balcony at night. She seemed apologetic and for like three days it was calmer. Then it went back to normal. Last week during a small heat wave I had all my windows open and she decided to have what she called a tiny girls night on a Tuesday. Tiny apparently means six people, several bottles and a lot of laughing straight up at my windows until 1am. I was lying in bed sweaty and angry with my white noise app on, listening to them yell along to some old song, and I just snapped. I leaned out and said, not yelling but also not sweet, that some of us have work in the morning and could they take it inside. She rolled her eyes and said I should relax and that its not that deep, they are just enjoying the balcony they pay for. I talked to the property manager and he gave me a bored answer about how as long as quiet hours are technically respected there is not much to do and maybe I should get an air purifier. My friends are split, some say I should just deal because apartments are noisy, others say this would drive them insane too. I feel dramatic getting this upset over smoke and chatter, but it feels like my home got invaded and I cant even open my own windows without tasting her cigarettes. Is this me being too sensitive or is she actually turning into a neighbor from hell?

1qwhlcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAssholeTalk/comments/1qwhlcq/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_cant_reset_our/,AITA for telling my parents they can’t “reset” our relationship just because I moved back home?,"I’m 27F and I moved back in with my parents (both early 60s) six months ago after a breakup and some burnout that turned into straight up depression. I’m paying them rent, I buy my own groceries, I clean up after myself. It’s not fun, but it was supposed to be a quiet landing pad while I rebuilt my savings and my brain.



The problem is that my parents seem to think me living here means we’re back in my childhood timeline, like I’m 16 again and they’re allowed to manage me. At first it was small stuff. My mom would comment on what I was eating, or say “are you sure you need a second coffee” with that little laugh that isn’t actually a joke. My dad started asking where I was going if I left the house in the evening. Not in a curious way, more like he was checking. Then it escalated. If I’m in my room with the door closed, my mom will knock once and open it anyway because “I’m your mother.” If I say I’m tired and going to bed early, my dad will do this dramatic sigh and say I’m “wasting my best years.” Last month I found out they’d been talking to my older cousin about me, like asking if she thinks I’m “on something” because I was sleeping late on weekends. I confronted them and they denied it, then flipped it into “we worry because we love you,” as if that erases the weirdness.



The biggest fight happened last week. I had a long day at work and came home quiet. My mom immediately went into interrogation mode: what’s wrong, who annoyed you, are you being negative again. I said I’m just tired, please don’t pick at me tonight. She got offended and said she’s “walking on eggshells” in her own house. My dad joined in and said I’ve become “sensitive” since therapy, and that maybe therapy is making me self centered. I felt my throat tighten up, like I was about to cry in front of them, and I hated that feeling. So I said, bluntly, “You don’t get to treat me like a project. I’m an adult paying rent, not a kid you can correct into being easier.”



My mom started crying instantly. She said I’m ungrateful and that if I don’t like it, I can leave. My dad said I’m disrespectful and that no man will “put up with” me if I speak like that. I went to my room and stayed there, heart pounding, feeling like I’d just done something illegal. The next day my mom acted overly cheerful, like nothing happened, and kept offering me food. My dad barely spoke to me. It’s that pattern they do: blow up, then pretend it didn’t count, then act wounded if I bring it up.



Now I’m second guessing myself. Part of me thinks I should have just kept my mouth shut because it’s their house and I did need the help. Another part of me feels like if I don’t set a line now, I’m going to lose my mind and I’ll never leave because I’ll be too drained to plan. AITA for saying they can’t “reset” me to being their child just because I’m under their roof?

1qwhhv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaMarzocco/comments/1qwhhv5/lack_of_consistency/,Lack of consistency?,"Hi guys. I’m a month in to owning a LM Micra and I’m struggling massively to get consistent coffee. In fact, I’m 750g into a 1kg bag of a wonderful single origin Ethiopian, and all but 2 or 3 cups have been pretty bad. I’ve been pulling my hair out trying to figure what I’m doing wrong here, as I’m not a beginner by any means and have never had this issue before.

Today I had the thought, could it be temperature? The  boiler is set to 95c and today I tested the temperature of 4 shots straight out of the PF. I got 71c, 73c, 70 and 79. The machine had ample time to heat up in between each shot, and always showed as ready in the app. 

Is this normal? Should it be losing this much temperature as it brews or do I have a faulty machine?

Veneers can be a great solution for some people, but they’re not for everyone. Here’s a realistic breakdown.

**Pros**

* **Brighter smile** Porcelain veneers are largely stain resistant, so unlike whitening, they do not re-stain easily from coffee, wine, or food.
* **Correct cosmetic concerns** Veneers can mask chips, cracks, gaps, uneven shapes, staining, and worn or small teeth. They are generally more conservative than crowns.
* **Protect worn enamel** For teeth with enamel erosion, veneers can restore appearance and add protection where enamel does not regenerate.
* **Natural appearance** When planned and crafted well, veneers can closely mimic natural enamel in translucency and texture.
* **Durability** With good habits and proper care, veneers can last many years.

**Cons**

* **Irreversible** Porcelain veneers are bonded permanently. Even conservative veneers usually require some enamel removal.
* **Possible sensitivity** Some patients experience temporary hot or cold sensitivity after placement, which usually settles but can occur.
* **Cost** Veneers are often considered cosmetic and are not typically covered by insurance.
* **Not indestructible** Veneers can chip or fracture, especially with hard foods, grinding, or using teeth as tools. Night guards are often recommended.
* **Not everyone is a candidate** Active decay, gum disease, heavy grinding, or severely worn enamel may mean veneers are not the best option without other treatment first.

**Bottom line**  
Veneers can be an excellent option when done conservatively and for the right reasons, but they require careful planning, realistic expectations, and an experienced clinician. A thorough consultation and discussion of alternatives is key before committing.

I checked the menu and most entrees are $50+ not including drinks, tax, or tip.



She made it clear that everyone is expected to pay for themselves and chip in for her meal as well. Normally I wouldn’t mind, but money is a bit tight for me right now due to some unfortunate events and she is aware of that. and this dinner would seriously stretch my budget.



I politely told her I wouldn’t be able to make it and suggested we do something smaller another day, like coffee or lunch, so I could still celebrate her. She got upset and said that birthdays are once a year  and that if I cared, I’d make it work.



Now some mutual friends are saying I’m being cheap and unsupportive, and that I should’ve just gone and ordered something small or put it on a credit card.



I feel bad, but I also don’t think I should go into debt for someone else’s birthday dinner.

While my workshop is taking a break, I'm reviewing my inventory of defective photographic equipment that has accumulated over the last few years. 

SLRs, lenses, and accessories are unpacked and superficially inspected. External condition, viewfinder, mirror, film chamber, and battery compartment. Then I make an entry in my directory with keywords. 

The devices are not always clean. Gloves protect me and the devices from fingerprints. The worst of the dirt can be removed with a bellows, dust brush, and a Kimwipe.

It's amazing that some cameras have come to me with film and batteries still inside. Obviously sold from an estate without any expertise. 

In the case of SLRs with motors, the film remains in place until I insert batteries into the camera and work on it. Rewinding without power is not possible. The old batteries have to be removed, and so far there have been no problems with leaked electrolyte.

1qwh9ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qwh9ri/heads_up_for_meticulous_buyers_whole_thing_is_in/,Heads up for Meticulous buyers - whole thing is in Python,"**DISCLAIMER:** I fell in love with the machine but am not a KS/IGG backer. I did order one for myself at full retail price, currently waiting for delivery.

So I started looking into the Met to see how long-term support can be handled in case the company goes under (I hope they don't but we know how KS goes). They thankfully do have the source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MeticulousHome), which means I could make a copy and run, fix and update the software myself if they don't update it anymore.

***However.*** The whole backend is basically written in Python, which in my opinion as a software dev, is an **awful** choice.

Don't misunderstand me, I LOVE Python, I use it for my job on a daily basis. It's easy to use, has a great community in my field. But it is NOT meant to be used for embedded software, meaning software designed to directly control hardware with strict timing, resource, and safety constraints. For a machine like the Met C/C++ would be more appropriate, and this being in Python to me explains all the bugs they still have.

I'm going to simplify this, but the issues are:

* Unpredictable timing: Python can pause or slow down at random moments. A coffee machine needs actions to happen exactly on time, every time.
* Not real-time: Python runs on normal Linux, which may decide to do something else for a moment. That can delay heater or pump control.
* Hard to keep things in sync: Doing many things at once is awkward in Python, and mistakes can cause delays or freezes. This can be an issue with as many sensors as the Met has.
* More things can break: Python systems rely on many libraries and background services. More parts means more chances for failure. I don't see how a few Python versions down compatibility can be guaranteed. Version conflicts in Python is an effing PITA, especially if a vulnerability is found in the future for specific package versions. And this machine \*will\* most likely be connected to your home Wi-Fi.
* Weaker safety guarantees: It’s harder to prove that Python code will always react fast enough if something goes wrong.
* Weak typing: Python handles variable types in a very laissez-faire way, which is good for flexibility and development speed, but bad for reliability code. I see no mention of mypy, pyright, pylance, pyre, or typing\_extensions enforcement. This means a variable can be a number in one place and then be overwritten to be text accidentally someplace else, which can lead to bugs.

Python is fine for menus and networking, not for controlling heat, pressure, and timing directly.

I'd strongly recommend them to hire an embedded systems programmer to make the software bulletproof, otherwise I'm not confident they can ever deliver reliable, robustly working software.",1,1770285501.0,espresso,11,0.51,False
1qwh9hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschooluk/comments/1qwh9hs/going_to_clinic_as_a_medical_student_is_a/,Going to clinic as a medical student is a humiliation ritual.,"good morning all, i hope your mornings have been better than mine. let me all tell you a story about bravery, passion, shame, and lust. 

me - fifth year medial student. goal - ENT clinic 

8.30am. i try to get the bus to placement, my card declines. idk why i have money. 

okay fine i’ll sort out some alternative but albeit inconvenient transportation it’ll take me halfway there and i’ll have to walk 25 minutes. it is 8:40 am and now there is no way that i will be on time. i start thinking of how best to flagellate myself so they forgive me for being late. 

get into town, google maps is telling me there may be a bus that reduces my 25m walk to a 15m transit. i will take anything at this point. 

get this blessed bus but it appears google was a liar liar pants on fire as this bus is travelling in the complete opposite direction. go to ask bus driver hoping he’d say ‘we’re just avoiding construction and we’ll swing round’. he looks at me like i had 3 heads. fine, no bother. 

i get off bus forgetting to tap off -£6 for me to enjoy later this week as it will charge me for the entire line. fine, excellent even. 

SPRINT to the hospital, made 25m into 10m, genuinely chuffed, i’m so contentious and hard working i deserve a merit. 

arrive and realise i have no idea where clinic is. fine, okay, standard. go into the surgical block because ENT = surgery (again, my resourcefulness and deduction skills on full display here. this is why i got into medical school) 

it is now 9:05 by some miracle i may only be embarrassing faux pas late instead of professionalism meeting late. 

no one in surgical block. flag down a kind nurse; ‘clinics are in the other building literally on the opposite side of this massive hospital’. fine, reasonable. i’m going delirious with stress at this point. ‘also there’s no way to get to that building from here and you’ll have to walk out the hospital and right round’ okay, even better, some people pay money to run like this. 

SPRINT to the other side, it’s 9:15. i’ve made it. 

‘Hi! i’m supposed to be with Mr X for clinic today!’

‘Mr x is working at hospital B today, who told you to come here?’

‘my timetable :))))))’

he sees me panting, drenched in sweat. and takes pity on me, he lets me sit in on his clinic but reminds me he is busy and running behind. literally fine, i wont even make noise i just want your signature to say i’ve been here please. 

he leaves and i sit in silence for a while. thinking about simply going completely mad and being admitted to psych. decide against it as repeating the year will mean having to go thru this humiliation ritual all over again. 

he comes back; ‘Mr X is actually here sorry’ - is my luck improving my goodness!

‘Hi! i’m here to sit in on your clinic :))) :p ;)’

‘I’m currently in a meeting - my clinic doesn’t start till 10:30’ 

sat at the cafe very impressed with my workout as i won’t need to go to the gym tonight. currently browsing indeed for any new openings for full time clown entertaining since i seem to be a consultant in that by now. 

**disclaimers!!! -** 

\- yes all the bus faff was my fault and yes i should’ve left earlier and made sure i had 12 different ways to teleport across the city. but here we are. 

\- i genuinely don’t blame any of the consultants. its busy work and not their responsibility to coordinate medical students. they often don’t even know we’re coming. i wish the med school made more of an effort to communicate where to go and what time to start - i understand these things are unpredictable but it eats away at your soul being treated as an afterthought in every clinical environment you go to.

1qwh8ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeMax/comments/1qwh8ai/why_your_tinder_is_a_ghost_town_its_not_just_your/,Why your Tinder is a ghost town (It’s not just your looks),"Hey everyone, Giovena here.



Most guys think they aren't getting matches because they aren't hot enough. But after analyzing thousands of profiles with my team, I can tell you that’s usually not the case. You’re likely just losing to the algorithm and sending the wrong social signals.



In the US market, Tinder isn't a social club, it’s a high-stakes competition. If you’re just winging it, you’re going to stay invisible. Here are the four real reasons you’re struggling and how we use [**Swipemax.ai**](http://Swipemax.ai) to fix them.



**1. Your photos send low-value signals** 

In the US, your photos tell a story about your lifestyle and status. I see so many guys posting hunting trips, gym selfies, or blurry bar shots.



**The Reality:** Gym selfies make you look self-absorbed to most high-quality matches. Hunting or fishing pics can polarize your audience before they even read your name.



**The Fix:** Our Photo Analysis identifies these vibe killers. We help you swap them for effortless shots, like grabbing a coffee or standing in front of cool architecture, that signal high social value.



**2. Your Elo Score is trashed** 

If you’ve spent months swiping right on everyone, Tinder has already flagged you as a bot or a low-tier user. Once your internal score drops, the app stops showing your profile to the top-tier matches.



**The Fix:** We run an Overall Assessment of your profile’s digital footprint. We look at whether your bio and photos are consistent. If your bio says tech founder but your photos look messy, the algorithm thinks you're a fake.



**3. You're swiping on vibes, not data** 

Most guys have no idea what their actual conversion rate is. Are you 1 in 100 or 1 in 1,000?



**The Fix:** We provide a Profile Performance Forecast. Based on your current setup, we predict your weekly match volume. If the forecast is near zero, it’s a sign your profile isn't just unlucky, it’s functionally broken in your specific city.



**4. Your bio is a boring manual** 

""I like Netflix and traveling"" is the fastest way to get skipped. US women see that a hundred times a day. You need a **HOOK**.



**The Fix:** Our Dating Coach Optimization Tips give you actual conversation starters. We turn your bio into bait that makes her want to call you out or ask a question.

1qwh821,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qwh821/baratza_encore_esp_pro_my_experience/,Baratza Encore ESP Pro: My experience,"I bought the **Baratza Encore ESP Pro** as a replacement for my broken **DF54**. After a full month of daily use, I feel comfortable giving a complete and honest opinion. I’ll start with the positives, then move on to the downsides.

**Pros:**

\+ **Excellent grind quality.** It’s noticeably better than my previous DF54 (which was already quite good). That said, I do feel flavors are more integrated and fuller-bodied with a conical burr grinder. I’ve experienced less acidity, fewer channeling issues, and more consistency overall. I suspect this has a lot to do with the very fine adjustment steps (2.2 microns) in the espresso range, which allow for extremely precise dialing in. Sometimes espresso just needs *tiny* adjustments, and this grinder really shines there.

\+ I’ve read quite a few complaints on this sub about the espresso range grinding *too* fine, to the point of choking machines even at settings like 30–35. That hasn’t been my experience at all. I’ve been able to go down to settings around 22–23 without issues. Not sure if Baratza has quietly fixed this in newer units, but it hasn’t been a problem for me.

\+ **Low retention most of the time.** Typically I get around 0.1–0.3 g per dose, and sometimes basically zero. The only downside is that retention isn’t perfectly consistent — some doses retain a bit more, some less — but overall it’s a non-issue.

\+ **Great design.** It’s compact, feels solid, and doesn’t come across as a toy at all. Material quality is good, and the display and lighting give it a very modern look. Compared to older Encore models, the difference is massive.

\+ **Easy to disassemble and clean.** This was one of my biggest frustrations with the DF54, so I really appreciate it here. It’s reassuring to know that replacement burrs are easily available directly from Baratza, without having to deal with chinese agents. 

**Cons:**

\- The decision to place the grind chute so far from the dosing cup is baffling. Even with the plasma generator, there’s still a fair amount of coffee spraying and falling outside, into the grinder chamber and onto the counter. The workaround is to raise and move the dosing cup closer during grinding, or buy one of those riser platforms on Etsy. 

\- The programmed timer resets when you unplug the grinder. Not a huge deal, but annoying.

\- I experienced clogging once, during a week when I experimented with RDT. Later I learned that RDT isn’t recommended for grinders with ionizers, and since stopped doing it, I haven’t had any clogging issues. Some coffee does still build up inside the chamber, but that’s where the easy disassembly really pays off.

Overall, I’m quite happy with this grinder. It’s not perfect, but the grind quality and fine adjustment precision make it easy to recommend, especially for espresso. If your main focus is filter coffee, I’d say the DF54 is probably a better choice, but for espresso, I personally prefer the Baratza.

1qwh7u1,https://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-matters/coffee-poets-16th-century-islam,The early modern Islamic world was embroiled in a bitter controversy over coffee. Much ink was spilt by poets on both sides.,"No premodern poet praised coffee with greater passion than the North African jurist-poet Abu al-Fath al-Tunisi (d.1576). As he wrote in one of his ‘coffee poems’: ‘The status of the precious coffee of the pot has ascended,/as the full moon of her cup unveils in the darkness./How beautiful she is – resembling molten jet.’

He was living in Damascus in the 16th century, at a time when the city was engulfed in fierce debate over a dark, aromatic beverage that was transforming the Islamic world. The controversy was rooted in linguistic, theological, and social anxieties. The word for coffee, *qahwa*, was, in medieval Arabic texts, used as a poetic synonym for wine, a substance declared forbidden in the Quran. For some jurists, this semantic proximity raised important questions: how could coffee share a name with an intoxicant yet not be considered one? One anti-coffee poem, by Nur al-Din al-‘Imriti (d.1485), condemned the drink:

>

Others, including the scholar Ahmad ibn Yunus al-‘Aytawi (d.1616), Abu al-Fath al-Tunisi’s archenemy, went further, denouncing coffee as a dangerous innovation. They regarded both its stimulating effects and the social settings in which it was consumed – the new coffeehouses – as deeply suspicious. These lively spaces of conversation, storytelling, satire, games, music, and poetry resembled, in the eyes of their critics, the wine taverns, places where social boundaries and hierarchies blurred in potentially unsettling ways.

Okay, I’ll stop vaping, I’ve been meaning to quit nicotine for years anyway. Then, episodes of extreme dizziness. Near fainting spells. Heart feels like it’s not pumping enough. My blood would boil then freeze. I thought my organs were shutting down and that was it. Three trips to the ER, one to my GP, and I’ve got four thousand dollars in medical debt and no conclusive answers.

“All of your vitals are normal.”

“There’s nothing wrong with your heart.”

“This could be vasovagal syncope.”

“No, we’re not going to give you a referral to a cardiologist.”

“It’s probably just panic attacks, let’s get you into therapy.”

I do therapy. I know what a panic attack feels like. I am now at the point where any slight bit of pain in my body triggers one, because I’ve only been given non answers. And I really can’t afford another ER visit. 

I haven’t been able to take my medication because it increases my blood pressure. I haven’t been able to drink fucking coffee. I’m raw dogging life, and I’m constantly on the verge of a manic breakdown. 

I haven’t been able to go to work for the past two weeks, and honestly, I’m one eye twitch away from calling it quits anyway. It’s a dead end job in food service. I have a college degree, but I feel like I don’t actually know how to do anything. Or I used to, but I forgot. 

There’s no relief. All of my friends are exhausted or on edge. I can’t go a day without hearing about the worst fucking thing that has ever happened to anyone. There isn’t any trust anymore. Hate, pain, and fear are reigning supreme.

Nothing makes me feel better. It’s all temporary blips of masking happiness until I can’t fight off the depressive cocktail that I don’t remember drinking. I can’t trust myself, and I can’t even trust that my physical reactions are real.

1qwgyt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1qwgyt0/conflicting_views_with_mil/,Conflicting views with MIL,"She's not from hell but we have conflicting views. Specifically revolving my parenting.

I wouldn't ask her advice on parenting and I don't. I don't even like how she raised my husband but I love him despite it. Her son, my husband, isn't her biological child. She never wanted kids and never been pregnant, wasn't a sahm.

This is her long term partners child. There's already a bunch of unrealatbility there. While you can be knowledgeable on pregnancy such as doctor it's very different from experiencing.

My toddler son and I are doing an extended stay, and I'm soon to give birth. It's been 2/4 months.

I'm planning on not speaking to her after this experience due to a recent disagreement.

I'm here while my husband is deployed. I was initially with my relatives, but due to some martial issues prior to deployment they view my husband differently and indirectly expressed not wanting him to stay in their house for the 3 weeks he's been approved to come back for the birth.

I made this decision in November to fly to my inlaws so my husband would have a place to stay while visiting. I'm living with relatives for the financial benefit (paying off credit card debt). If it was absolutely necessary I could go back to the military base. Both parties (my family and his) offered me to come stay with them while he's deployed.

In December I flew with my son for free before he turned 2 in January. My husband's side of the family is experiencing my son for the first or second time since he was 4 months old, we celebrated Christmas, his bday, the plan is for them to see the new baby, and my husband can see his family as well. I did this for my husband. He didn't ask for this but I was being courteous. I know how he feels about feeling excluded from his family and our home state and we live near my family and our son is experiencing my side more.

Today we got into a verbal disagreement. She asked if I had anything I wanted to say. Basically everything she's been thinking came out opposed to me I held my true thoughts to myself out of respect. She just told me all the negatives of how she views me as a mom. I personally don't think she did any better. This isn't the first time she's passed comments. When my husband would call and confide in her she always sided with him. Literally when the issue at hand was his fault. She doesn't say much, she minds her business for the most part, but when she does I'm never pleased.

I don't talk on the phone often but she mentioned "" I don't know who you be talking to on the phone.""

I told her who and I told her ""I call people I know and trust to seek advice from.""

She says, ""we will see who you trust and where they will be when the baby gets here."" She also told me, ""don't underestimate her because she only has 1 kid.""

She said goodnight after those last statements and though I'm 36wks pregnant and shouldn't be flying I'm not comfortable with her being my emergency contact while in labor and my husband isn't reliable due to him being deployed. He does have a set date but he can't do anything unless he's here.

Its likely I would be in labor alone due to grandparents watching my son, and some other relatives needing to work.

I don't feel comfortable anymore and I compromised for my husband and his family. My MIL doesn't know the real reason I'm here. (About my family not wanting my husband to stay at their home) I just made it seem like I'm visiting for her grandchildren and son. I compromised and I feel like it won't even be appreciated for it.

I need to do what's best for my kids and I. I care about my husband but it'll have to just be unfortunate for him not see the birth and see his family like I planned. My sanity is more important. I have to worry about myself not him when he's in another country. I feel my MIL has the best interest in the kids and not necessarily me. She cares about me because I'm married into the family and kids. Whereas worst case scenario I rather be back with my family and have them as an emergency contact. They also know how to manage my son better.

My MIL is a smoker, she smokes outside due to us being here. The way she changes diapers is questionable, I understand it's been a while but sheesh, what she feeds my child when I'm gone is smh, and I know she won't be able to put him to sleep for a nap or bedtime, bath time, brush his hair, and brush his teeth. Who's going to do this for the days I'm in the hospital? She also doesn't want up early. My son wakes up between 5:30am-7. She wakes up near noon and needs to smoke n drink coffee first.

She's just fun with no discipline. My son doesn't take her serious. He wants to play with her not listen. Because of the smoking and no listening idk how a smoker will operate when they don't get to smoke. She doesn't watch him 24/7.

I'm strict as far as nap and bed time being within a certain time, and I don't let my son do the things he wants like throwing his toys, beating certain things. Making him sit and eat opposed to letting him eat and run away, come back and eat. He doesn't eat super healthy but I don't want him having many sweets and she always talking about dessert and treats. My husband had cavities growing up. My MIL says their teeth are going to fall out anyways. Such an ignorant thing to say. Why would I care less about his teeth because they're going to fall out? If he did get cavities and cause him to go threw dental pain.

My MIL is free spirited and says he's only 2. That's true but you have to teach them young. My son understands, obviously doesn't know everything. If you let him get away with it he will do it. That's even with adults.",2,1770284362.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,1.0,False

She’s maybe 5’4”, beautiful eyes, adorable light dusting of freckles. The second she looks up at me, she makes me weirdly shy; I stumble over my order and have to repeat myself like a total idiot.

After I make it though my order, I ask for the restroom code and she tells me, I head in thinking I’ll just pee quick. But right as I’m about to go, my phone rings, it’s a work call. I’m standing in the restroom, awkwardly trying to finish the call first, then finally tuck my phone away so I can actually take a piss.

Just as I’m finishing, literally standing there, cock still in my hand, I hear someone punching in the restroom code. I figure it’s fine, because I locked the door. Spoiler: I did not.

Suddenly, the door swings open. And it’s her. The cutest fucking barista in LA. She walks in, stops dead, and just stares…her eyes lock straight onto my dick, and she holds there, not even blinking. It feels like forever, but it’s probably a couple seconds. Then, with this slow, flustered smile, she finally drags her gaze up and locks eyes with me.

I’m standing there frozen, still holding cock, absolutely mortified. As I slowly walk towards the door to close it, all I can manage is, “I’m so sorry, I thought it was locked” but she doesn’t move right away, she just keeps holding my gaze probably traumatized. I finally reach for the door and try to close it, my heart pounding out of my chest, apologizing again, all flustered.

Now I’m just sitting with this wild mix of embarrassment and total shock I feel like I’ve hit some kind of peak.

So now what? Do I pretend it never happened and keep going back like normal? Do I apologize again if I see her, just to clear the air? Is there any way to come back from having the world’s most awful first interaction with the cutest barista in LA? Or is this a sign to find a new coffee shop?

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for abduraimov plays tchaikovsky on 02/06. the kennedy center is beautiful, but honestly, parking around foggy bottom is a nightmare, especially for a weekday morning show at 11:30 am.  
  
before anything else, check out Prked. this is the real insider move. it's an app where you can rent people's private driveways or empty garages right next to the venue, often way cheaper than the official lots. you skip all the main garage traffic jams on the way in, the walk is super short (look for spots near new hampshire avenue nw), and it's a huge time-saver.  
  
the official kennedy center garage is on-site and the most convenient, but it's first-come, first-served and they warn it can fill up, even on a weekday morning. the standard performance rate is $25. you can pre-pay for $22 online, but you have to remember to do that at least one day ahead. there is a cheaper early bird rate ($16 or $17) but you have to be in by 9:30 am for it, which is likely too early for an 11:30 am concert unless you plan to have a long coffee first. access the garage via 25th street on the south or new hampshire avenue/f street on the north side, and be aware the max clearance is 7 ft.  
  
nearby official alternatives that the kc recommends are the watergate garage and columbia plaza at 2400 virginia avenue. the watergate is a short walk and sometimes you can find a good deal there if you use one of the parking apps like spothero, with some lots going for around $17-$21.  
  
definitely try to avoid street parking if you can. it's near the gw campus, and weekday parking restrictions are notoriously strict. you'll find signs for things like ""no standing 7am-6:30pm"" that will cover your entire concert time, and dc parking enforcement does not mess around.  
  
arriving early is absolutely key for this show. 11:30 am is past the initial peak rush, but rock creek parkway and the approaches to the center are still busy, and dc police sometimes close roads like virginia avenue or 24th street for special events which can totally snarl traffic. give yourself a good 30-45 minutes buffer to get parked and inside without rushing.  
  
if you want to skip driving altogether, take the metro to foggy bottom-gwu and grab the free kennedy center shuttle. it runs every 15 minutes starting at 9:45 am, so it’s a great, stress-free option for this morning show.  
  
hope this helps and enjoy the tchaikovsky!",1,1770283959.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1qwguv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniqueWeddings/comments/1qwguv1/is_spending_15_dollars_per_guest_on_wedding/,Is spending 15 dollars per guest on wedding favors absolutely insane or is that normal now?,"My fiancé and I are planning our wedding for next fall and we've hit a major disagreement on wedding souvenir ideas.

 He wants to give everyone personalized engraved keychains or custom candles, which sounds lovely until you multiply it by 150 guests and realize we're looking at over 2000 dollars just for little gifts people might throw away. I'm thinking something simpler and more practical. Maybe packets of local coffee or handmade cookies in nice packaging. Something people will actually use and appreciate without breaking our already stretched budget. But everywhere I look online, including forums and wedding planning sites, people are doing these incredibly elaborate favors.

I found some really cute bulk options on Alibaba that would save us a fortune, but I'm worried they'll look cheap. Do wedding guests actually care about favors or even remember them?

1qwgrya,https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1qwgrya/real_talk_ids_saying_ai_is_slop_really/,"Real Talk: IDs saying ""AI is slop"" - Really?","Disclaimer: Spicy word-wall, rage-batey, but REAL.

I’m tired of the “AI slop” conversation because to me, it doesn't sound like a critique anymore but more like a misinformed confession from a burnt-out ID. Yes, AI can produce slop. We are highly trained to deal with slop. That's basically our work. Also, we deal with slop from humans all that time. You’ve worked with SMEs, right? RIGHT?? So what really is your point?

When a human gives you slop, you do your job. You write emails to clarify, clean up whatever mess was given to you, and shape it into something usable. RIGHT??

But when AI gives you ""slop"", these IDs act like there is no workflow. Their world suddenly stops with that ""slop"". Which is weird, because AI is the one “SME” that won’t push back, won’t get offended, won’t make you feel stupid for asking basic questions with a ""why don't you know this"" tone, and won’t say “I’m busy, circle back next week.

Here's what an ""AI slop"" workflow looks like:

1. ID types ""give me a course on \[topic\]."" in ChatGPT/Copilot free version.
2. They gasp in ID: “This is crap. Why didn’t it consider X and Y? This is outdated. A course on X and it gave me ONE page?”
3. They then smile smugly, fully convinced AI could never replace them, while quietly sipping coffee in a corner and telling another ID, “See? We’re safe.”
4. The other ID, who didn’t even touch the tool, posts on LinkedIn: “AI is slop.”

A lot of “AI slop” complaints are coming from IDs whose job is basically “make content.” Those who are used to being given a document and they just transfer the content to PPT or Storyline. So when AI makes content fast, they panic, judge it for lack of content and context they never provided the AI model in the first place, then cope by calling it ""slop"".

Meanwhile, some IDs who do the the heavy ID stuff, the analysis, data gathering, interview with audience, and ID math like seat times, cost estimates, etc. are rejoicing!!! Because by the time they touch AI, they’ve already done the hard part. They’re tired. They dump their notes, let AI **DRAFT**, take a quick breather, then come back and validate, pressure-test, and turn it into a strategy. And since their AI model has data and context, it just produces GOLD! No slop. It knows what you're working with, and gives it exactly what you want.

Sometimes AI even comes back confirming what the ID already suspected: training isn’t the solution. No course needs to be built. No deliverables. No “slop"" to work with with. The ID doesn't even need to write the push-back email. AI can handle that elegantly. No tantrums.

And then they say, it hallucinates. So does your SME on a Tuesday and you on a Friday. That’s why we have a job. The fix is the same: read it, call out the nonsense, give constraints, iterate. If you can QA a human, why are you sorta saying that you can't QA a chatbot? Worse, you speak as if AI is the devil and whispered to you that you should submit whatever it gave you, and y'all are inches away to giving in.

Yes, IP issues. Don’t use it. It’s that simple. But if you’re not even using it, how are you in the “AI slop” camp?

If AI keeps giving you slop, it’s probably GIGO: Garbage in, garbage out. (Sorry.) The tool didn’t fail. Your process just isn't there yet. It can be if you learn it.

And if you’re still mad at AI, fine. Keep calling it slop. Keep refusing to learn it. Keep posting about it. The tool has improved a LOOOOOT and If everything you get is still “slop,” I assure you, everyone, those who actually matter, know that it is not the model anymore. :)",0,1770283654.0,instructionaldesign,0,0.43,False
1qwgrjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1qwgrjm/lason_ang_pagibig_sa_taong_puno_ng_pangarap/,Lason ang pag-ibig sa taong puno ng pangarap,"I’m a male 25-year-old first-year medical student, and I was recently left by someone I was seeing (23M), a first-year law student. We met noong semesteal break namin last December. It was casual at first, getting to know this and that tapos naging serious na; coffees, peanut butter noodles, and long conversations of dreams and the kind of people we aspire to be.

Our worlds naturally overlapped— he met some of my friends by chance habang nasa labas kami; I met some of his the same way. It felt organic, grabe. Na para bang sinadya ng universe na makilala ko mga kaibigan niya at 

siya sa mga kaibigan ko. Akala ko favourite na ko ni Lord.

Syempre, pinag usapan din namin yung magiging demanding workload namin pag nag simula na ulit yung classes namin. Kinakabahn siya sa law school kasi scholar siya and sobrang demanding ng school nila (I would know graduate ako ron eh). Still, I believed— and I was told— na kaya namin to na well make time and well compromise. As someone whos in the medicine field of course naiintidihan ko yon and what it mwans to commit.

Pero, nung nag simula na sem nila, bumagal na yung messages, naging routine na yung how are yous namin. We tried talaga— pictures and updates— lahat para maging part kami ng daily lives ng isa’t isa. Pero naka “bunker mode” siya lagi, its a stare of conserving energy para bang naka autopilot para ma survive yung workload. I tried to be patient, reminding myself na ganyan talaga ang mga nasa post grad and I’m lucky enough to have time and was able to manage my workload before my semester started. Pero para kasing nag bbeg na ko na tumingin siya sakin. Na mapansin niya ko.

So sinabi ko sakanya, sabi ko na parang nag bbeg ako na pansinin niya ko. Nung sinabi ko yon, he called it off

Mahal niya raw ako. Sorry daw kasi hindi niya na rreplyan yung isang “I love you” ko. Na nahihirapan daw talaga siya sa school ngayon. Na he loves and he wants me— pero he wanted his future more. He told me na he was choosing himself and his ambitions over us.

I couldn’t be mad. I understood of course. Nasa postgrad ako. If anything, may bittersweet feeling pa ko naramdaman kahit umiiyak ako. He was so passionate about his future and I genuienly believe he’ll be an excellent justice someday. Intellectually— I understand his decision. Emotionally, I’m still trying to catch up.

Since then, syempre I tried confiding with friends about what I’m feeling. I buried myself in school work and ginawa ko ng bahay yung gyn. Sinubukan ko pa nga mag entertain ng ibang tao pero wala eh. Its not the same. Walang nakatulong.

Gusto ko mag message, gusto ko sabihing “huy pagod lang tayo pero kaya yan pwede to mag work” Pero pag binabasa ko kasi ulit yung last message niya its clear na he made a choice. I also dont believe there is someone else in the picture. Knowing him and our many conversations, I truly believe this was about capacity and not replacement.

Pero ganon talaga, ano? Minsan kailangan talaga natin tanggapin na may mga tao talaga sa mundong ito na DAPAT nila piliin ang sarili nila at kanilang mga ambisyon sa buhay.

1qwgriu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qwgriu/should_i_tell_this_to_a_girl_im_dating/,Should I tell this to a girl I'm dating?,"Hi everyone, so I have a question about whether I sould disclose some information to the girl I'm dating or not. When we started dating she heard a rumor that long ago (like half a year before we even started texting and dating) I was texting with a female coworker that was in a relationship (that girl reached out to me, I wasn't the one that texted first!). 

I didn't know she was in a relationship but my girl doesn't care about that and still blames me because – why was I texting a girl that has a boyfriend. She sometimes mentions that topic and it always escalated because I started explaining myself, but we agreed we will close that topic for good. I explained like a million times to her that nothing happened between us and that she shouldn't worry about it. 

There is one piece of information she doesn't know and that is that long time ago I went with that girl to grab a coffee. She does know for previous situation where that girl invited me for a coffee and I never made plans with her because in that moment I knew she had a boyfriend and cut off all texting and talking to her. Nevertheless she blames me because I didn't respond to that girl ""No, we won't grab coffee"" but I said ""Yeah we'll see"" and never made plans (I acted that way because we're coworkers and didn't want any kind of weird situation between us) and she tells me it's equal as if we went on a coffee. Every time the topic of that girl is brought up, my girl starts to talk about how we should stop seeing each other etc.

On that coffee nothing happened between me and that girl and it was a totally friendly and benign coffee.

The rolling hills, lakes catching the afternoon sun, and sudden glimpses of old castles along the way made the countryside feel magical.  
  
We left Essen around 9 AM, stopped briefly in Mannheim for coffee, and took the scenic route through the Odenwald. There were a few spots where we pulled over to stretch and snap some photos, the view near Felsenmeer was stunning. The roads were quiet mid-morning, so the drive itself felt relaxed and peaceful.  
  
I actually had my DDPAI dashcam running the whole way, so I got some awesome clips of the countryside and even some little moments on the road I would’ve missed otherwise like a herd of deer crossing early in the morning! It’s amazing how a dashcam can capture the journey, not just for safety but for memories too.  
  
I’d love to hear from others: what are your favorite scenic drives in Germany or nearby? Any routes with great views or unexpected stops? Bonus points if you share dashcam clips or photos from your drives, looking for inspiration for my next getaway

They are two different beans I have tried Myanmar as of now. I don't know yet how to explain the flavors, but still, let me try.

I brew it with an Aeropress using room temperature water. I don't like coffee with milk, so it's just cold extraction. 

The flavor I perceive is smoky, somewhat sweet with cold, and I get a good aroma of coffee's duskiness.  


All over Myanmar is something of my type for my daily use. I will post an update about the other one soon.

Nevertheless, that is something I have already tried at the café it was more about the fruitiness.

Greenwich Council plans to increase council tax by 5% starting in April, the highest rise allowed without a public vote.

For a typical household, this will mean paying around £96 more per year in total. The council says the increase is needed to help fund adult social care and deal with rising costs. Councillors will debate the proposals as the council faces ongoing financial pressure in the coming years.

**GREENWICH**  
  
**GREENWICH COUNCIL TAX TO RISE BY 5% IN APRIL**  
Greenwich Council plans to increase council tax by 5% starting in April, the highest rise allowed without a public vote.

For a typical household, this will mean paying around £96 more per year in total. The council says the increase is needed to help fund adult social care and deal with rising costs. Councillors will debate the proposals as the council faces ongoing financial pressure in the coming years.

**STUDENTS PUSH BACK ON GOLDSMITHS’ CATFORD RELOCATION**  
As we reported two weeks ago, Goldsmiths is relocating its art and design department from its current Deptford Bridge site to the Old Town Hall in Catford. But after the move was approved, many students have started to raise concerns.

They say the new location will nearly double their commute time, going from around 14 minutes now to roughly 27 minutes by bus. The move is driven by the demolition of the old Lewisham College buildings to make way for a high-rise development with over 900 homes.

Council leaders say the relocation will boost Catford’s town centre economically and socially, even as students remain mixed in their views.

Today's Pick: **PGA Top X Finish Parlay**

Wager Amount: 2U to WIN 5.62U

League: WM Phoenix Open (ESPN+/CBS/Paramount+/Golf Channel)

**Recap**: That was not great! At the very least De'Aaron did take 3 three pointer attempts and that's really all I can ask for unlike Myles Turner who refuse to take a 3 point shot in the 2nd half. So I will take eat this 100th L. Not a bad beat so I can live wit that.

**Matchup:** Doing a parlay for this POTD to get good odds to ramp up my units, so I'm taking these 4 guys to finish where I think each golfer will end up. Scottie Scheffler (Top 10), Hideki Matsuyama (Top 40), Si Woo Kim (Top 40), and Maverick McNealy (Top 40). I don't see how any of these guys don't finish their respective place. Dead heat rules apply in this parlay so if one or more ends in a tie then it's likely this will payout as a reduce win (hopefully not less than the wager amount). I attached a screenshow below

https://preview.redd.it/u47motiw6nhg1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=3245aee9bcba94d46b3e7be0d0c6d4a4c385e172

My reasonings for picking these 4 golfers is simply due to great form. Scheffler won this tournament couple times in his career and is considered the very best golfer in the world. Hideki is in great form, and same wit Si Woo Kim and Maverick McNealy. They all had great success in this golf course and this event. 

**The Play & Prediction :** 2U on this PGA Top X Finish Parlay. I use my DK boost on this lay. 

**NOTICE: This is a 4-Day event and wager will result after the conclusion on Sunday evening, so do not wager this lay if you are expecting your money prior to the conclusion of this tournament.**

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

I started Concerta OROS 18mg about a week ago. I’m not suicidal, but I’m exhausted by how empty, repetitive and meaningless life feels right now.

My days all look the same: wake up, breakfast, coffee, watch series. Then online studying, gym, same walking routes, same concrete-feeling city, same stores, same food. Evenings are books, sometimes games, more series. Repeat. Every week feels identical.

I’m painfully bored, understimulated, and anhedonic. Everything feels grey. At the same time, I want to do things. I want energy, purpose, novelty, something that feels alive. Concerta made this more obvious: I feel the drive but have nowhere to aim it.
I can’t travel, study online, no like-minded people nearby. I’d love a part-time job for structure and money, but there aren’t any. I live here for my girlfriend’s studies, but the place depresses me.

What scares me is: is this it? Monday–Friday work, gym, tired evenings, weekends recovering, one boring vacation a year, repeat until retirement? Meanwhile, the world feels unstable—climate crisis, wars, economic uncertainty.

I’m studying social services, but I’m not even sure I care. I just want to experience life, not just survive it. I crave the feeling from shows and movies: The Office, Superstore, Brooklyn 99 – shared life, community, inside jokes; Her, Manchester by the Sea, Drive – quiet melancholy; Good Will Hunting, Dead Poets Society – depth, meaning. Instead, I feel my soul slowly suffocating from boredom and under-stimulation.

I pulled a girl who was ""passively bitchy"" from a street approach to the hotel in under 2 hours. Most guys would have ejected within the first 5 minutes.

Here is the breakdown of the interaction and the specific ""Delhi Psychology"" I used to bypass her defenses.

The Stats
- Location: Sector 18, Noida
- Vibe: Closed off, ""Bitchy,"" Testing my frame.
- Time to Pull: ~90 Minutes.

I approached. She was cold. I tried to bounce her to a Theka (Liquor Store) to loosen the vibe. Her Reaction: Immediate judgement. She gave me a dirty look. A lot of ""Daygame"" guys would force their frame here.

I didn't. In Delhi, if you take a ""good girl"" to a Theka too fast, her ""Slut Defense"" goes up. She thinks you are trying to get her drunk. I immediately pivoted: ""Okay, you don't drink? Let's grab coffee.""

If you show her you can calibrate to her comfort, she lowers her shield.

We are in the Cafe. She is sitting opposite me (defensive). I need to get her to the hotel. We got in the auto and she panicked: ""Where are we going? Tell me!""

I looked her in the eye and said: ""We are going to a place with good music. If you don't like it, you are free to leave. I won't stop you."" Indian women are terrified of being trapped.

The moment I explicitly stated ""You can leave,"" her logical brain shut up. She felt safe enough to enter because she knew the exit was open.

We are in the room. I try to kiss her lips. She blocks me. ""We are not kissing."" Most guys would beg or quit here. In her mind, Kissing on Lips = Relationship. But Sex = Arousal.

If she kisses me, she feels like she is ""betraying"" her values. If she just has sex, she can tell herself ""it just happened."" I stopped escalating on the lips. I escalated on the Neck, Collarbone, and Waist.

I used the ""Cube"" routine to distract her conscious mind while escalating physically on her body. Result? She submitted. The Lay happened without ever kissing on the lips.

I hear guys in Delhi complaining that girls are ""prude"" or ""conservative."" They aren't. They just have different Safety Protocols than Western women.

1. Pivot Fast: If she hates the alcohol idea, switch to coffee instantly.

2. Safety First: Explicitly tell her she can leave.

3. Bypass the Mouth: If she blocks the kiss, go for the neck.",2,1770281271.0,PickUpArtist,1,1.0,False

Here’s my actual workflow (I work from coffee shops, not more than 3-4 hours a day, for 3-4 separate projects / apps at a time ):

1. Review the last day priorities - 5-10 minutes

2. Pick the bulk of the work - 15 minutes

3. Actual vibe coding session, here’s how this works:

I use Claude Code on my iPad, with remote repos. On each app, I maintain a different branch, usually named version/X.x.x, and then I set up XCode Cloud workflows that will trigger builds on merging to master.

All coding happens in the version branches, until the app compiles, and the feature I’m working on is ready to test.

Then, still on my iPad, I open my Github app and start a PR, aiming at merging the version branch into master. If there are no conflicts, I hit merge, and that triggers XCode Cloud builds. I am on the normal developer plan, so I get around 25 hours per month. If you are paying attention to what you’re doing, even with 3-4 apps developed at the same time, this is more than enough.

A build is usually taking between 2 minutes and 10 minutes, and then there is a little bit of processing time. I use these gaps to enhance the prompts and write logs as the features are implemented. Once the builds are up in the App Store and processed in TestFlight, I just open the TestFlight app on my iPad, and begin playing with the apps.

Most of the time, bugs are found, or incomplete implementations are revealed, so I get back to Claude Code and start the whole process anew. This takes between 3 - 3 and a half hours, then I move to the review stage.

4. Review stage: commit, log and write down tomorrow priorities: 15 minutes.

What are your thoughts on this?

1qwg2zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qwg2zq/i_was_being_harassed_yesterday_and_i_still_feel/,I was being harassed yesterday and I still feel yucky about it,"So to start off, I'm not a little girl, I'm a woman in my mid thirties and I've experienced my fair share of catcalling, inappropriate comments and uninvited touches throughout my life. I'm usually able to shrug it off, so not sure why this one still sticks with me.

So I'm in a foreign country for work for a few weeks and had a day off yesterday. I decided to just have a stroll through town to get to know my environment. It was pretty cold, so I ended up getting a coffee and sitting down on a bench for a couple minutes to warm up. That's where this guy approached me. We didn't really have a common language, so I didn't know what he wanted at first and was trying to be polite. But he kept scooting closer and I kept moving away. Then he touched my leg, I told him ""don't touch me"" and decided to leave. But he kept following me, trying to wrap his arm around me and stuff. I tried to make it as clear as possible with body language that I don't want this. Kept saying ""no"" and ""stop"". Who knows whether he understood me. I tried walking faster, dude still followed me. Tried walking slower and taking a turn, he waited and followed me. Dude now started making vulgar sexual gestures and showing me wads of cash for some reason? Maybe he thought I'm a prostitute?

At some point I thought I managed to shake him off by entering a shop, and then he still reappeared from behind and touched my butt again. I thought about slapping him, but didn't want to get in trouble with the law in a foreign country, so eventually bought a ticket to a museum and entered and thank god he didn't follow me.

Idk, I still feel kinda violated and a bit shaken up from this. It felt different from being touched inappropriately in a club or something, maybe because he was so persistent? Or maybe because it was so unexpected in broad daylight in the middle of the city? I just still feel yucky about the whole thing and for some reason didn't even wanna talk to my friends about it. But maybe talking about it will help me let it go, so here we are anonymous Redditors. Thanks for listening to me vent.
