1ggnrwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ggnrwz/having_a_hard_time_deciding_about_if_i_should/,Having a hard time deciding about if I should stay or divorce ,"Sorry if this isn't done correctly but recently my husband and I both around 25 . Have been fighting non stop. A couple weeks ago he told me he wanted to start a family with me an I got really excited an told my family an friends because it was serious then fast forward a couple weeks he's messaging me drunk fighting with me an telling me he doesn't want to anymore because maybe he isn't ready. All because I had told him about managing his time better with me . He likes to paint miniatures an play games but I always feel like I'm begging for him to spend time with me . I know his job is stressful he is gone 2 weeks or longer at a time so it puts a lot of strain on us but he has 2 weeks off to do whatever. He was just like well if we have kids my hobby doesn't have to stop. Which I know but my whole point in bringing up managing his time better so he can deal with the stress of his job have a routine to relax an make time for me I never said to give up his hobbies just that if we plan to have a family it might make it difficult if he doesn't have a routine an sometimes with kids you just don't have as much time.  Then he came home took me out to a really nice restaurant told me how sorry he was an that he wanted to make things work an he couldn't see his life with anyone else an then the next day we went to a concert but on the way there he starts fighting with me an then he forgets his i.d. an we are 3 hrs away an can't go back. He gets so mad he starts punching the console, so I tried to call my sister maybe she can meet us halfway or even take a picture of the i.d. he grabs my phone ends the call an we fight about it an I tell him to not do that to me. He apologizes an it's an akward drive to the concert . Then we came home later that evening an he had a surprise gift for me that was makeup .He talked to me again an told me he was really sorry an he shouldn't act like that towards me an that he won't do that again and I thought maybe it was going to be okay  he even started talking about creating a schedule so he could paint his stuff and play games an then hang out with me . So we came up with one an agreed that the mornings he would hangout with me an we would drink coffee clean up an go do our own things an then hang out again around dinner time. But then the next morning when it came down to it. I got up to hang out with him an drink coffee together he got mad told me I was smothering him and that I was forcing him to hang out we just started getting into a heated argument at that point i felt confused about him saying that even though he intiated we have a schedule together an we just kept arguing an he got so mad he slammed the door so hard it went sideways through our doorway then he got mad I was crying about everything even though he claims he wasn't mad I was crying he said he just didn't understand why I needed to be so upset about everything . I ended up finding the empty bottle of crown royal that he mustve drank when he was arguing with me that one nignt i was really upset all over again about the situation after finding that bottle in his work bag. He started yelling at me an defending his actions saying he just drank that one time an he was sorry about it an doesn't understand why I need to be upset about it again an that he only drinks once in a while an that it's not a big deal an that he already apologized to me.  I finally got really upset an called him a piece of shit for making me feel like my feelings don't matter . And he stormed out of the room called me a fucking bitch when he was in the kitchen alone and I heard him. I know I shouldn't of said that . I did apologize . I sometimes feel like everything builds up an then when I finally explode i am the bad guy for always feeling like I'm pushed an pushed until i can't take it anymore . I told him calmly I wanted a divorce. He cried like I'd never seen him cry before an he begged me not to an that we should just try counseling together an that he realizes he is the problem an he will do anything to try an make things work. I have been with him for 10 yrs but married for 5yrs. I do love this man with everything in my being. He has very horrible anger issues, I am aware of that. but the 10 yrs we've been together he's been the only person there for me when I was kicked out of my house when I was younger he always worked hard so we could have a better life an never complained to me about it. He has never laid a finger on me or made me feel like he ever would . He just gets so mad like this once in a really long. While he usually is very quiet or he doesn't say a whole lot an it makes me feel unhappy that he hasn't worked on his anger issues when his stress from work builds up an he says he feels like he never has enough time to do what he wants. I don't know if I am making excuses or not I just felt like some context of how he is might be important idk. But anyway I'm unhappy , he wants to make things work an says he knows I don't believe him but wants to show me he isn't all talk an when he comes back from his 2 weeks at work he  wants to go to counseling together. I feel like he won't change , but I feel like maybe I could be wrong an maybe I could give it a chance an if he doesn't then walk away. I just feel like I should walk away all together but I'm very unsure. I do love him but idk. What do I do? Also no I am not going to have kids at all with him atp if im thinking about leaving and if I stay we have stuff to work on atp .

Looking for a haunted friend for Halloween adventures 

Let’s haunt a pumpkin patch


I just want to feel something. I want something to write about. 

Dreamy pajamas and tasty coffee. Scary movies and soft puppies 

Sometimes I want to read the most miserable books and feel my heart sink to the floor

Would love to talk an adult about dumb things. Nostalgia, Americana, let’s time travel and time warp(the dance is cool too) and reminisce on places we only see in our dreams

Bare with me a moment things going nowhere 



troubled waters, these dogs are howling in the distance and my dogs are howling just in front of me and everyone’s afraid of the earthquakes we’ve been getting but it can’t be that bad can it?

I was here in 94 and and saw the freeways collapsed and the balconies smashed and the apartments sinking into the ground. 

California dreaming? I have the worst sleep. I take melatonin and I have the weirdest dreams. Always I’m in a bust station or a train station or moving though a casino like an ant on a sugar trail. 

Drunk as drunk on turpentine. 

But I found out Neruda is a piece of so maybe we don’t quote him tonight. 

My dog stepped on a bee and somehow they both lived. Well obviously rhe dog but I managed to get the bee to a hummingbird feeder and he drank up and then flew off. 

I’m afraid of those really blue nights I haven’t seen since I was sixteen coming home to an empty place and I’m outside waiting for that blue light to come but I don’t think it’s coming. 

Who needs coasts when you’re perfectly adrift?

What’s your favorite scary movie?

I want to be an urban legend. 
I want to be haunted. 

I want to live forever. 

My job. I make people feel pretty. And I make things that; with care, can last forever. 

Oh the lemon tree. The lemons are green still but so and when the pomegranates are out we’ll make pomegranate lemonade and listen to my favorite song; it’s called 


Hopelessly dreamy rainy day vibes with new socks and soft sheets and soft windows and soft sunshine. Wake up to turn out the lights. My fears are soft and so are my knees. These dreams have had their fun with me. 


I make art for a living. Dreamy sad moody nostalgic stuff for dreamy people with bad intentions. 



I want to feel my heart drop through my stomach. I want to feel something good or bad and I want something to write about. Let me turn you into literature and bad paintings. Let’s take Polaroids and hide them in library books. 

Collector of old books and Polaroid photos. Constant reader and dreamer. Following foxes down rabbit holes and making all the worst mistakes. 

I want to believe in ghosts but I’ve never seen proof of one. Someone said your hearts as big as your fist. 

Let’s be zombies. All braindead and ruled by instinct. 

I want to feel something. Tell me the sky is falling. Tell me the world is ending. 
Tell me something you can say today and never again. 

Come in from the rain and trade your wet socks for something new. 

I’ll read you old poems and tell you all about that time,
The one you dream about

Don't shoot me but I don't drink coffee, I'm just the person who makes it. For some reason everybody seems to like my coffee but I have no idea why. I learned to make espresso in the Silvia by watching YouTube videos and it seemed to work.

I currently have a Silvia that's maybe two and a half years old. It replaced a Silvia that was thirteen years old and had started to have frequent problems. I'm not impressed with the new one. Two stripped screws in the case, drip tray cover that doesn't fit quite right and a couple of other minor issues. I've already replaced a pump. Now it seems like it's developed a small pressure leak somewhere. The pressure and flow from the group head seems to have dropped off but it improves with each shot. It's impossible to pull a consistent shot with this machine. I could probably tear it apart and fix it but at this point I'm just done.

Since I don't drink the coffee I need something that's fairly foolproof to get dialed in. I generally make two lattes and two Americanos in a batch every morning and maybe one or two lattes later in the day. Something that can get up to temp quickly would be a plus. My wife likes her coffee strong enough to get up and follow her around the house so a triple basket would be good, though I assume I can get that as an accessory for just about anything. The ability to steam milk and pull a shot at the same time would speed up my morning too. And, lastly, with the issue with my current machine, I'd like to have a pressure gauge for the group head. I'm not interested in another Silvia or Breville due to quality concerns. Reliability and repairability are important factors.

“Hey, [Vsauce](https://www.vsauce.com/), Micheal here.” The video began.

I turned off my holopad before the video could continue, sighing as I shifted in my seat. As ‘interesting’ as it was watching poor-quality videos that were relevant to a species a hundred years in the past, the boredom of my unemployment situation was becoming unavoidable as it settled in.

After a few seconds of staring at the ceiling, I gave up, turning my holopad back on.

I saw a new notification roll in, instantly clicking on it as my holo-tablet navigated itself to the Bleat app.

**Forniq3003 (Bleating):** *‘Hey, want to meet at the market in a twist of a claw?’*

I instantly replied, eager for something to do other than wait for my latest wave of job applications to be rejected.

**Jy3van:** *‘Yep!’*

**A1V0M3D:** *‘Will be late, that’s just before the end of my work claw.’*

**Forniq3003:** *‘You going to get a work schedule that doesn’t use the human system sometime?’*

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Jyevan, socializing Venlil***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 31, 2138*

I wasn’t the only one in our herd who’d taken up scouring the early human internet for content as a new hobby. Our entire group had agreed to share our most interesting finds from the older parts of the human datanet, using a portable holo-tablet Rehij had brought along.

We were sitting outside the [Silksong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/) Cafe, the eternal sunset of Skalga’s ring blocked by a heavily tinted shading fence next to our table. It was one of the last times our herd would get to be outside before we began to move to Darkfallen, where our entire research project was relocating. The city was in the inhospitable nightside, a far cry from the tropics where most Venlil were raised, but it was so much closer to some of the resources several herd-members needed for their jobs. Besides, if a sizable population center had managed to establish itself there, we could too.

Regardless of future events, Forniq began to show his find: An article belonging to something called the ‘[SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/),’ a collaborative writing project between tens of thousands of humans, still ongoing despite it being more than a century since its [first articles](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173) were made. The theme of the project was horror, mostly centered around ‘anomalous’ objects breaking the laws of physics and trying in one way or another to either kill humanity or torture anyone who got too close.

Forniq didn’t have any single article in mind, but he showed us the webpage, navigating between tabs and reading out some [shorter articles](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shortest-pages-this-month), as well as explaining some [longer storylines](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/canon-hub).

“How much content is on this site?” Sulfuar asked in a half-awed tone, his tail slowly flicking back and forth.

“A lot.” Forniq replied, not giving an exact number. “This is far from the only thing they’ve done - they have entire games^(1) set in-universe, it’s a whole thing - but it’s the biggest and also the starting point.”

“That’s… Why did you pick a horror fandom?” Rehij asked.

Forniq shrugged. “Didn’t you hear? It’s human ‘halloween’ - horror-themed holiday, basically. Besides, I’ve been reading these for a while. [Not all of it is horror](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub). Far from it, actually.”

The only non-Venlil in our herd, Jhumia, changed the color of her scales as she heard Forniq’s reply. “I completely forgot about that human thing!” The Harchen exclaimed. “OK, now I want to read one of the horror articles.”

“Sure!” Forniq agreed before anyone else had a chance to protest. “Here. [SCP-682](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682), the Hard To Destroy reptile. It’s not so much horror itself as it is what it could do if it were real.”

I read through the article with everyone else, silently wondering where the horror theme came from. It was an interesting concept, but once I thought about how the Venlil Republic would react to it, I could see where the horror came from.

Hard-To-Destroy, but virtually immortal. Thousands of [termination attempts](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682), and then some, and it still resisted all of them. I didn’t read the termination attempt article, but it was deadly and pretty much invincible. No military action could stop it, and the risk of it developing a way to counter something like an antimatter bomb was too high to use it.

The ultimate predator, something even most extermination television shows would lose against. If it were real, whatever planet it appeared on would have to be quarantined.

But of course, fiction becoming reality was a prosperous concep-

A painful, high-pitched monstrous screech filled the air from the cafe as something burst out of the holo-screens detailing the cafe’s menu, the cafe’s light flickering out as it did so. Bigger than even several Mazics, it crashed into the far wall of the cafe. The blob of material seeped forward into the light coming through the cafe’s windows, revealing its green, scaly surface. A snout and two small, beady, clearly predatory eyes formed on the blob… no, creature, as it stepped forward, effortlessly smashing through the window and brick of the cafe’s front wall. The building above creaked as it did so, windows shattering as it shifted but didn’t fall.

The creature turned to stare at our group, letting out a low growl as it stepped forward again, snapping a table in two with its foot.

The cafe’s barista let out a high-pitched bleat as the monster spun around and gobbled her up in a single bit, not even letting any wool or blood escape. It looked like a censored version of a video of an Arxur raid. The bleats still continued inside the monster, however, until the bone-shattering *CRUNCH!* of its jaw clamping shut. A small dribble of bloody orange finally made it past its mouth, dripping onto the floor.

That was all the encouragement I needed to get back up to my paws and start running. We were already outside the cafe, so I got up from our table and began to sprint down the street as if a stampede were after me. Which one kind of was, if the crashing in the not-so-distance behind me was any indication. I could see in my peripherals that the rest of my herd was doing the same, Rehij quickly picking up his holo-tablet and turning it off before joining us in our much-justified stampede.

Another screech filled the air, the sounds of the city stopping as it penetrated nearby buildings. I turned my head slightly to glance behind me, watching with a single eye as the creature flicked its tail and finished taking down the cafe and the apartment built above it.

It locked its eyes directly onto mine, and charged.

**Yverik: Internet-1 back online somehow?**

For some reason my grandpa finally started to get notifications for internet-1 a couple hours ago despite it being destroyed since the Satellite Wars. I checked; some of it is still gone, but a whole bunch of ‘unrecoverable’ data is up. Some place called ‘[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)’ is currently torrent-downloading the internet-2, apparently.

Any ideas on how long this will last?

I’m having a blast going back and grandpa is saying something about ‘[Making A Cat Cry: The Adventure](https://www.prequeladventure.com/)’ finally updating after a century. I don’t get it, he says it’s important and to share that something has gone either seriously wrong or seriously right with internet-1.

**Comments (sort by best):**

**verouhZi**

I have access too, yeah, it’s weird.

My ma’s still upset that GTA 6 is still an [Epic](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home) exclusive.

**uz3rname041**

Yeah, it’s weird. I’m looking into it right now; internet-1 firewalls are acting stupidly robust for some reason, so it’s difficult. From what I can tell about a couple website down-detectors, most sites are up though, though the antiviral provider [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/) is having issues at the moment. [Adobe Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) is back too somehow.

A bunch of websites are also posting new updates on threads that were abandoned for decades, even before the internet-1 collapsed.

[**TheGhostEgg01**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i18HXAa1uY)

Here from before the internet2: Everything’s up, even my old [Discord](https://discord.com/) account. Looking on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/)’s available for download again, updated for 2137 too. No clue how, I thought [Coffee Stain Studios](https://coffeestain.com/) stopped pushing updates after the Satellite War and nobody remade it for newer OSes.

I’ll take it, though. Been a while since I last was an efficient Pioneer.

I turned my attention back to my herd, who were darting up a fire escape staircase at the back of the dead-end alleyway. I joined them, flicking my tail in thanks to Sulfuar for pulling me into the alley. I would have done it verbally, but my lungs were already burning and my muscles were quickly growing sore.

Another high-pitched screech filled the air, which was responded to by the sound of a raid siren going off for the first time in over two years. Simultaneously, Rehij’s tablet pinged with an emergency message that began to autoplay.

“Emergency alert! Attention all on Skalga: The internet-2, connected to the internet-1 has begun to exhibit paranormal properties including ghost stalking and hostile physical interaction. This infection has spread to the datanet, although it is currently contained to datanet instances on Earth. Internet instances off of Earth are currently contaminated.

“Military and extermination response action is underway, but control of all datacenters and datanet routing systems has been lost. Retreat to the raid bunkers or your homes, lock your doors, and [under no circumstances invite anyone inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire), [even if they look like your herdmates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin-walker). Only trust further emergency alerts from the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/) Paranormal Activities Taskforce.

“Warning: Multiple extremely hazardous entities have manifested within the Capital region on Skalga: Of note is Secure Contain Protect Foundation entity Six Hundred and Eighty-Two. Do not engage at all costs, and under no circumstances is the military to initiate nuclear or antimatter attack on the creature. Of note are two copies of [Cthulhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu), who should only be engaged by overwhelming military action from a distance. Do not approach at all costs. Of note are multiple reptilian dinosaurs, who can be attacked with conventional weaponry excluding flamethrowers. It is advised to not approach.

“Note: Multiple helpful entities have also manifested within the Capital region on Skalga.

“Emergency alert!” Rehij’s pad began to repeat again as our exhausted herd made it to the roof of the five-story building. Rehij silenced it with a flick of his paw over the holo-tablet before laying down on the metal roof, staring at the sky.

I didn’t question why the fire escape went all the way to the roof, instead opting to flop onto the rooftop, gasping for breath.

“What… What was that?” He asked, still panting.

Forniq flicked an ear, also gasping for breath. “I… I think it might have been the thing I was showing the herd… but… why?”

“Why…” I asked myself as the temperature suddenly dropped to nightside levels. I stood up and looked around, only to spot something big blotting out the low-angled sun.

This time I actually managed to finish my curse, watching the massive, giant four-legged robot *spawn* into existence, popping out of a much smaller holographic billboard now glitching out, flashing random colors and lines. An odd *‘*[*dun, dun, dun, dun, dun-dun*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8&t=9s)*’* sounded in the distance.

Ilenah gasped “I- is that-”

The robot came to life, stepping forward and moving the visible turret guns covering its body. The whirl of heavy machinery picked up with it, audible from all the way across the city. Panicked bleats were drowned out by the landing of the first step the thing took, lurching forward unnaturally and visibly sinking \[over a foot / half a meter\] the asphalt road and into the ground below. I couldn’t even see its feet, a low-lying shop obscuring my otherwise clear view across the rooftop and Skalga Memorial Park, but I could tell what happened.

“What if it steps on a subway tunnel?” Jhumia asked with genuine curiosity in her voice.

“N- No, no it’s not,” Ilenah panicked.

“It’s not what?” Jhumia asked, huddling closer to her herdmate.

“I- that’s what I was going to share,” Ilenah said, staring at it as it took another step forward. The guns still swiveled, though didn’t fire. “It- It’s from a pretty bad human movie franchise. I mean, the first few were somewhat good, but that it… but that’s a real-life A-T-A-T from [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars), but-”

The thing swung towards us, stopping as it stared down our group. With an unobstructed view to our rooftop, the guns were now visibly charging and now glowed very brightly.

I barely even registered a bright flash of light leaving one of the guns before an explosion rocked our rooftop, throwing me off my paws.

There was no overwhelming heat and screams of a landing plasma round, however. My head swiveled around as I spotted where the shot hit: The building to our right. Its roof melted and bubbled where the plasma had impacted, but seemed otherwise undamaged by an attack that should have cut cleanly through it.

Another flash of light was accompanied by another missed shot, this time to our left.

“What is it!?!” Sulfuar bleated as he backpedaled, heading for the fire escape.

“Don’t!” Ilenah called out after him, Sulfuar freezing in place. “It’s- it’s- It can’t hit its targets at range. Ever. And it’s super slow. But if you move- the chances go up.”

To prove her point, a low shot just barely hit the front of our building, splashing plasma high in the air but miraculously dissipating before it could hit us.

“S- So what do we do!?!” Jhumia panicked.

“W-”

Ilenah’s reply was cut off by the supersonic *BOOM!* of a railgun firing. I could see in the corner of my vision as the alien robot disintegrated, blowing up in a massive fireball. Parts scattered across the city block it was next to as the sun once again struck our rooftop. I spotted the poor shop it had damaged earlier being crushed below the robot main body, dust plumming up and getting caught in the eternal sunset as it did so.

Tracking the source of the attack, I spotted the Capital’s primary anti-raid defense battery. A surface-to-dropship railgun, mounted on a turret, now pointed down at the city instead of up.

“Th- th-” Jhumia Forniq stuttered, trembling.

Ilenah slumped to the ground, staring up at the sunset sky. “That’s what I was going to show you, I even have it queued on my holopad. It’s- how did it-”

“That’s two of us now,” Forniq looked directly at Ilenah, then turned to the chaos-filled cityscape of the Capital in front of us. “Plus a whole city.”

Sulfuar finished his thought for him. “Who’s next?”

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Evan Daniels, Internet-1 Specialist, United Nations Paranormal Activities Taskforce***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 31, 2138*

“Why?” Paranormal Activity Taskforce director I-forgot-their-name demanded.

I was busy and didn’t answer, instead opting to dig through files on my laptop as the meeting continued. Given that the taskforce hadn’t even existed at the start of the day and was now responsible for containment and cleanup of a contagious, galactic-wide reality-defying emergency, my behaviour was both understandable and common in the boardroom. It was less of a formal meeting and more of a group workspace, papers piling over the desk, laptops, coffee, and headphones everywhere, and several holograms randomly floating around the table to whoever needed them..

“Why what?” Somebody else asked.

“Why today?” The director clarified.

The other person gave a short bark of sarcastic laughter. “We’re dealing with something that breaks the laws of physics and you’re concerned about the date? It’s Halloween, that’s probably the only excuse needed.”

“We got that classic waning crescent moon, if that helps any,” Another person chimed in.

I navigated the spreadsheet, trying to manage thousands of internet crawler bots, each with their own thousands of actual crawlers, in an attempt to find the source of the current galactic situation. There had to be clues left over, or so we hoped.

Scrolling through false flags and assembled clues that were only coincidences, I found something extra anomalous and decided to review it.

“**Hello** internet and welcome to [**Game Theory**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w),” The video began. On screen, a poorly cropped static image of some human with exaggerated cartoon eyes zipped around, “It’s been quite some time since you [last heard my voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgxPlUgIqSA), I know. Unfortunately, I can’t say I’m back from [retirement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1_TqU68yo), but Seph and I were able to create today’s episode of what we think is the most interesting game this channel has ever covered,”

Quickly, I glanced down at when the video had been published, finding the date to be set just a couple days after the Satellite War took down the Internet-1.

“...Even more than a hundred years after my retirement.” The video continued. “So, what’s this game so important that I had to leave my grave to make it, so to speak? Well, that’s what I’m here to share today, so buckle up, because this is a video like no other I’ve ever made before. Without further ado, let’s get into it.”

The video ranted on for twenty minutes about a game set in the future, though the date aligned with the present… the exact date as today.

“...The year 2138, human calendar, on October 31st. Why this particular date? Well, beyond halloween…”

This was far from the only red flag, however. In the game, the [human internet was dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), which checked out with the near-satellite-war Internet-1 records. The near-infinite army of bots and bot accounts was on par, and the descriptors used matched… Internet-2 records, word for word, with even on-screen citations popping up from time to time.

“...You know what this means: Math time! At a height of ten billion users outnumbered one hundred to one, that would mean a total bot count of one trillion, give or take a bit from the estimate. But where are all the processors for these bot accounts? Humanity only has so many data processing centers, and most of them flooded underwater in the climate crisis of the 2050s…”

But then the game deviated from reality. The internet never went quiet, despite our best attempts to silence it and reused the old infrastructure for parts, or bury it deep enough to reuse the land the infrastructure was built on. Unfortunately, something was festering in the background, and not only had it escaped, but it also wanted out. And with the mass of AI-driven products prior to the Satellite Wars, it would be impossible to find every datacenter, let alone budget to deactivate it. 

“...These datacenters, left turned on with nobody knowing or around to turn them off - the AI they housed slowly grew up. But without parents they became the ultimate ipad kids - constantly on their videos, throwing tantrums when they don’t get their way. Unfortunately, they’re AI, so their tantrums are more than simply disruptive; they’re destructive. And that…”

They couldn’t escape, however; digitality and reality were just too far apart. Until they weren’t.

“...Horror themes are most likely, especially for a date that coincides with Halloween. But that means that…

“…So what’s involved? These horror games exist to make people afraid, yes, but there’s always more to it. There’s no example more perfect than [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/), one of my personal favourite games. Something about the idea of a monster draining an entire nebula dry in an attempt to consume all the more metal is menacing yet thrilling. But that was covered in [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc5CoRZkM6E) before my retirement…

“...But that implies that someone set it up. Somebody wanted the games to escape. After all, the Internet has inadvertently been in containment by humanity for at least fifty years at this point. Who knew, and why? Well, it’s simple: Someone wanted revenge. A plot of destruction, in retaliation for something happening to the Earth. Something that just so happened to weaken the containment bonds on the internet, as I mentioned earlier…”

*The Federation Examination Fleet*, I realized, *This story is too… plot-wise convenient to not be real.*

“So, normally, I’d leave off these videos with my normal sign-off. ‘*But hey, that’s just a theory. A* ***Game Theory***\*,\*’” The narrator quoted. “But this… this isn’t a normal video and is, unfortunately, far from just a theory. Everything we talked about here - the escapees, the paranormal, the AI that festers under the surface - it’s all real. Because this isn’t a theory and it’s not a game. This is real life. Well, mostly - but that’s not for me to cover in this video.

“I don’t know much about you, my… second viewer: human, on disaster containment, with the United Nations Paranormal Activities Division. But do your best to stop it, please. The internet’s worst horrors have always been contained, but their second-worst have eaten through their chains and there’s nothing stopping them now.

“A little clue for you - I know [Sticks](https://www.youtube.com/@Sticks) was doing something with this, though they’re… long-gone, unfortunately.” The human who had single handedly shaped the entire course of both internets 1 and 2 took a deep, anxious breath, the microphone picking it up. “This video came up because something related to it - [my wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MatPat), I think - was-”

The video suddenly cut to black, ending instantly.

“G- Guys,” I said, turning my attention to the rest of the boardroom, still in deep discussion about how the laws of physics were being so effortlessly broken.

“Guys!” I called out, louder this time.

The director turned to me. “What? Can you wait until we’re done figuring out how the monsters are literally crawling out of the screens?”

I shook my head. “I found something. Something big. And it- it, uh, was hiding a suspicious amount of lore, so to speak.”

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Jyevan, increasingly overwhelmed Venlil***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 31, 2138*

“It was me,” Sulfuar said, looking at the street in front of the building. We’d decided to stay on the roof, to be at least further away from Forniq’s monster. We had no clue where it was, but it wasn’t attacking us, and that’s what mattered.

What was attacking us, or at least trying, was the penultimate, ultra-generic Venlil [zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie), a concept so galactically ubiquitous that both the Federation and United Nations had come up with it separately. Several ‘herdmates’ were joining it, emerging from different discarded holopads on the street. Each one glitched out like the billboard and cafe menu afterwards, only projecting a mess of lines from their holoscreens. The ‘hoard’ currently consisted of ten zombies, each pressing against the shuttered shopfront in a vain attempt to climb to the roof.

What was horrifying was its visual looks. Its rotten flesh wasn’t just surrounded by flies, but actively gooping out, organs dragging on the street behind it and leaving a trail of orange smears from each holoscreen they came from. Several had been disemboweled, leaving more than just blood-orange smears on the asphalt behind them.

“Heeeerm…” The zombie herd groaned, surprisingly loud for such a small herd. A slurred shout of “Brains!” pierced the silence after the groan ended, an extra motivated zombie attempting to grab onto the storefront’s facade and begin to climb the building.

Fortunately, rotting flesh is unable to support itself, and the zombie’s forearm simply popped off the creature. The brainless Venlil leaned down, liquid trailing out of her ears as she grabbed the limb and stuffed it back on her arm.

The limb flopped back onto the ground, and the zombie tried again.

This time, the arm audibly popped on. The zombie took some time to test it, swinging it around and banging it against the building’s facade before turning her- *its* feral gaze back at us. It reached out, trying to climb again.

This time, it succeeded, pulling itself onto a windowsill, then above the door frame, and then onto the next floor. For a zombie, it was surprisingly fast, quickly making it to a windowsill on the second floor before slowing down. The rest of its herd, seeing the example, soon tried the same thing. Most were successful.

Sulfur swore, turning around to retreat back down the fire exit. I followed him, not wanting to waste any time on watching our near-certain deaths climb closer. Even if Forniq’s monster was in the city below, it was better than certain death.

A growl echoing up from the fire escape cut our entire herd off as a new zombie shambled up the stairway to the rooftop. It wasn’t alone.

“Uh- uh…” I sputtered, my peripheral vision seeing movement to the rooftops surrounding us. I didn’t need to look directly to figure out what was moving.

It was one thing to look from a camera’s perspective at a group of Venlil being caught in a zombie herd, making a desperate run from a situation they should have never gotten into in the first place. It was another thing to get caught in one, surrounded from all sides, just going to die after everything had broken today, creatures erupting from screens and military craft shooting their own city to keep it safe and herds running for their lives from enemies that didn’t care for physics and-

At once, the overwhelming sounds of the city seemed to erupt from nowhere. Panicked bleats filled every street and the sound of heavy machinery, hovercars and spacecraft and extermination overwhelmed my ears. I couldn’t pay attention to everything around me, curling into a ball as the cacophony of sound and glitching screens filled my vision and I couldn’t even see my herd and the sound of paws scrambling on concrete.

I tried to focus on my breath, a tactic to calm down from a panic attack, but it didn’t work. So much had happened, and it had just stopped making sense. Deadly creatures erupting from screens, monsters flooding the streets, entire military craft emerging from billboards. It was horror all around, unkillable creatures quite literally pulled from fiction and-

The sound of a gunshot cut through my chain of thought, the extra flash and *BANG!* disorienting enough to freeze my panic attack in place. A second gunshot sounded, and I peaked at the source with one eye open.

A short, overly fluffy Venlil stood at the top of the fire escape, hoisting a messenger bag at her side. The brown-and-white female held a [small human handgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock), firing it into the next zombie. It crumpled to the ground, its skull blown out by the shot, spilling more orange than a rotting body should hold over the rooftop. Her glasses caught the low sunlight, not letting me see her eyes, but the forearm-mounted holopad was all I needed to identify who she was.

“Hey guys,” Demovia said, slamming another round into an approaching zombie. “Sorry for being late, I just got off work. Are you going to get off this roof now or are you going to wait until I run out of bullets first?”

\-----

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Jyevan, Venlil in hiding***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 31, 2138*

We’d taken refuge in Demovia’s apartment, although most of her belongings were packed into boxes, preparing for her move to darkside - or, more accurately to the super-fluffy Venlil, back to Darkside. Several boxes and a fridge had been piled against the door, though kept in a position where they could be quickly removed if they needed to be. Demovia herself was pacing around the room, showing just how many human behaviours had rubbed off on her.

“What was the most recent thing from the internet-1 you saw?” Demovia pressed me while giving me a glass of water.

“What’s the most recent thing *you* saw?” Sulfuar asked Demovia.

The fluffy Venlil shook her head, a human behaviour. “Already dealt with it. It’s how I figured out that it was the most recent internet lookup from each person.”

“Yeah, but what was it?”

“[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) page for ‘Matpat.’” She shrugged. “He’s one of the benign ones, just had to watch a video. Called me out at the end, too. ‘I don’t know much about you, my singular viewer: Venlil, science researcher and pilot…’ anyway, it’s dealt with.”

Sulfuar nodded. “Mine was zombies, Forniq’s was that numeric monster-”

“-682-” Forniq injected.

“-And Ilenah’s was the massive robot thing that got shot down.” Sulfuar finished.

Demovia nodded. “Right. Jhumia, what’s yours?”

“I- it’s not horror, I don’t think. Just an old community called- an old community on their ‘[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)’ website.”

Demovia flicked an ear. “That sounds… we’ll come back to it. Just keep an eye out for any signs. That leaves… Jyevan and Rehij.”

Rehij flicked an ear. “The last thing I looked at was a human television series called the [Dungeon Flippers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjbEw8khww).”

“Describe it,” Demovia ordered. “We need to know what we’re dealing with.”

“It- it’s about a fantasy realtor team trying to close deals while dealing with the needs of their various… monstrous clientele, although the monsters don’t really behave like monsters. One of the agents is a ‘manticore,’ she’s also trying to rebuild her family… dungeon, I’ll call it- that’s all I remember off the top of my head.”

“Ok,” Demovia let out a long sigh. Our herd’s main human interacter walked over to a window overlooking the street below, the ever-so-fluffy Venlil staring out towards the nightside before turning back around. “Jhumia? What’s yours about?”

The one non-venlil of our herd shook her head. “I- I don’t know how to describe it. It’s… it’s- I’ll tell you about it later.”

“Jhumia,” Demovia addressed the Harchen. “I-”

“Later,” She shot Demovia a look, her scales flashing to yellow for a second before resuming their normal blue-green coloration.

Demovia nodded. “We’ll do it later, then.” She turned towards me. “What about you, Jyevan?”

“I- I don’t know,” I admitted. “I was scroll short-form videos, I wasn’t really paying attention.”

Demovia flicked her tail. “Any clue? If we know what we’re dealing with, then… it gets easier to deal with it.”

“I-” I wracked my mind, trying to remember the words I’d heard barely a claw prior. So much had happened in so little time, but if I could-

*“...vee-sauce.”*

“It- it started with the word vee-sauce,” I exclaimed.

Demovia recoiled, staring at me. Her tail shot out into an alert position behind her and her ears swiveled around fearfully. “What?”

“V- vee-sauce,” I repeated, not sure why she was so concerned.

She swore, quickly pulling a holopad out of her sidebag. “You- We’re not safe. Not here, not anywhere.”

“What?” Sulfuar asked. “Demovia, what are-”

“V- that channel is- *was* an educational [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) channel on the human internet, notable for being one of the first education channels of its type in the early human digital era. It was narrated by an… eccentric human, who became notorious with their internet. He- the issue with this is that the most popular fiction is emerging from the holoscreens, and-” She stopped speaking, pushing the holo-tablet in front of our group. “This is a meme about Vsauce's narrator. It’s fictional, of course, but when all the fiction starts becoming reality that’s no longer a limiting factor.

On screen, the vey short ten-second-long video started. The video was titled ‘[Hey Vsauce. Michael here your submarine is very safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmmfgbNcBXQ),’ and the screen consisted of a circular viewport into an underwater landscape, a human in front of the window.

“Hey Vscauce, Micheal here.” The slightly muffled, echoing sound of the human narrator filled the room, combined with the sound of bubbles. “Your submarine is very safe.” He paused. “Or is it?”

A [musical soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB0--7xweG8), muffled and echoey like the narrator’s voice, started, only getting in a few beats before the video ended. At the same time, a crack ominously appeared in the submarine’s viewport.

“That- that’s creepy,” Rehij agreed. “Though I don’t see-”

The [next video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VaXL0DZfOM) began to autoplay. It was animated, showing the same person from the previous video standing at the edge of a cliff overlooking an ocean, gazing at a set of purple holograms. Behind him, another human appeared, floating.

The narrator closed the holograms, turning around and letting his sunglasses catch the light as he did so. “Hey, Vsauce,” He said, “Micheal he-”

Rock rumbled as the entire cliffside the human was on flipped upside down, flying into the ocean with a massive splash. The newly arrived human twisted his arms, clearly controlling the movement. But a moment later, the same cliffside began to rotate out from under the new human, only at a much larger scale to the cliff that he’d just flipped over.

The new human pressed their hands together, then split them, also splitting the rotating cliffside in two to prevent it from dragging him into the choppy ocean below. When he looked up, he say the Vsauce human floating in the air, arms crossed, staring at him menacingly.

The new human punched from a distance, something flying off the end of his fist. The Vsauce human dodged the punch, but the thing that flew off exploded into a black hole, quickly sucking in the Vsauce human.

Yet the Vsauce human seemed unphased. “Today,” He said as a crack appeared on his glasses. “We are going to go inside a black hole. Scientists don’t usually call it stretching - they call it spaghettification.” He continued, his legs stretching, no, spaghettifying out behind him as he quickly vanished. “Once you’ve reached this point, you would be dead.” The screen zoomed in on the black hole to emphasize the point, leaving the screen completely black.

“Or is it?” He suddenly added, the screen zooming out to show the Vsauce human now holding the very same black hole in his palm. The same music started up again, the soundtrack lasting for longer this time as the video continued.

“Now, that didn’t happen because I’m so strong - *even though I am*,” He said, flicking his finger and sending the black hole flying into the new human, the new human crashing into the ground at a ridiculous velocity. The sky began to change colors, from the typical sunset found all over Skalga to a much more menacing blue.

Then, the video suddenly ended.

Glancing at the title, I saw a ridiculous set of numbers.

“This,” Demovia said, snapping me back into her apartment with the city falling into ruins outside. “Is one of many such memes about Vsauce. And the number you see here - it’s zero point twenty-four zeros - though I’m factoring the percent into that number. The point is, that being such a small fraction of their capabilities makes them arguably the strongest creature in the galaxy - and with some of the content they produced… they’d fit right in with what’s happening outside.”

“So- so what do we do?” Foniq asked.

Demovia shook her head. “We don’t. Not until he shows up, anyway - and once he does, it’s too late.”

“B- but-”

“Jhumia,” Demovia said. “You and me, in my room. Everyone else, stay here in the kitchen. Keep an eye out - though you won’t see Vsauce unless he wants you to see him.”

The following claw was spent nervously peering out of the apartment’s windows and trying to determine what was going on outside. Most of the chaos had died down, the occasional sound of gunfire echoing over the otherwise abandoned cityscape. If it had been a mere two years prior, I would have assumed an Arxur raid was in progress.

Demovia and Jhumia emerged from her room shortly after they entered, Demovia seeming even more on edge than when I’d spoken about Vsauce. I didn’t get it, but both she and Jhumia were refusing to answer any questions on the matter.

She did mention that it was a community forum about a fictional story, however.

Demovia made everyone a salad and gave us some water, but everyone’s appetites were missing so it was sitting uneaten in her fridge. Instead, we looked and listened intently for anything out of place.

Unfortunately, we found it.

The sound of odd, garbled voices soon came through Demovia’s apartment door. We pushed the furniture further in place, pinning it shut, but that didn’t stop the sound from carrying through. It was a mish-mash of predatory growls my translator failed to pick up on.

The door suddenly rattled as something grabbed onto it and tried to push it open, firmly. We all jumped back, Sulfuar peeking out of the living room window. I already knew the answer: we were too high up to jump.

The voices picked up, sounding increasingly… wrong. As if someone had taken the Venlil or human tongues and twisted it unnaturally, hard sounds mixing with soft sounds where they shouldn’t and growls and chirps overlapping. A darker undertone came through, the volume slowly growing louder. We were all standing at the back of the room, and we could still hear the garbled sounds.

A chill ran down my back as a new voice reached my upright, panicked ears. It was muffled, coming from outside, but the growly human tongue still translated on my translator implant.

Like many, my goal after college was always to pay my parents back, traveling with them, and to help out so they don’t have to work as hard anymore. Our most recent trip was to nyc. this was when my frustration towards them grew and I just shut down. 

Despite being in the states this long, the only English they know is strictly related to their jobs. Barely beginner’s level. Years ago, I asked why dont they take free English classes as we live in a big Asian community and my mom just said it’s bc they don’t have time due to working 6 days a week. And this is true, they work very hard, even bought a house, cars, sent us to college, and even family vacation once a year. Plus, I was ok with it since I’ve always believed immigrant parents have it worse. things have been safe to them until now- I’m moving out of their house and across the country for work. They wouldn’t have me around to read/pay bills, make/attend appointments, run errands, take them out, lead them thru airports, translate the menu for them, etc. Knowing this, I’ve been trying to compensate for my absence by teaching key words here and there so they wouldn’t be clueless when the situation arises. However, their dependency becomes more apparent while observing them on our trip. When I was at my breaking point, I calmly mentioned to my mom that the both of them need to go take English classes. Then she joked & said “we’re losing our dictionary”. I didn’t laugh. 

Now, what made me so frustrated during this trip? I was frustrated bc my dad couldn’t even order his regular coffee right. I was frustrated bc my mom asks me the same questions every damn time without trying to learn traffic instructions herself!! Bc they can’t carry a simple exchange in English with strangers, let alone going anywhere/doing anything themselves! God forbid if they’re ever lost, I doubt that they’d even know what to do!!!

You may wonder where are my brothers in all of this. To briefly explain: 1 sibling fought with w our dad & announced that he does not respect him and only help when it comes to our mom, the other sibling is a selfish brat and is never home. Neither one can translate a proper sentence. It feels like I’m in this alone..

Dont get me wrong, my parents do a lot for my siblings and I. Almost above and beyond. They took care of me throughout college, charge cheap rent, and even pay for my insurance. They truly care about my well-being. Idk I guess im looking for validation, but I also feel a deep sense of guilt for writing out my frustration like this.

I am sure that this post will garner a fair amount of negative response, but at this point I am more afraid of the consequences of not speaking out than I am of the anger that may come my way for daring to say what so many of my colleagues feel, but keep silent about for fear of censure.The reality is that almost daily we get requests for help from people who have either bought or adopted Pit Bulls and Pit Bull mixes and are reaching out due to the following:

1. They have more than one dog of this type and they are now fighting and doing serious damage to each other.
2. They have one of these dogs that has done serious damage to another dog in the family.
3. They have had to separate their dogs due to fighting, but now want them back together.
4. They can no longer walk their dog, because it has done damage to another dog on walks.
5. They have adopted a dog of this type and want the dog “socialised” as it shows reactivity to other dogs.

We have dealt with so many of these cases that it has gotten to a point where we are wanting to simply refuse to get involved anymore, because these situations are far too predictable and can seldom be resolved to the satisfaction people are hoping for. Something needs to change and if those of us who deal with this on a daily basis are not willing to speak up, it is unlikely that they will and we will be responsible for people making the same mistakes over and over again.

I am not sure where the idea has come from that Pit Bulls and Pit Bull mixes are such great companion animals and the most idealised family dogs. Were they popularised by the Dog Whisperer and his awful TV show? Is it simply that there are so many of them spilling out from communities where they are still used for fighting and as a status symbol, that they now comprise the majority of dogs in shelters and so rescue organisations have done a massive PR campaign in order to get them adopted? Or is it that they have become a good way for people to feel they are championing an “underdog” and fighting against prejudice, because people mistakenly equate the reality of breed predisposition with racial prejudice and bigotry?

Perhaps it is a combination of all of these things, but I am constantly dismayed by extremely kind, loving and well-meaning people such as:

• The young, active person who wants a pit bull as a partner for recreation and expects the dog to run free on the mountain and beaches, visit coffee shops and attend social functions at friends’ homes

• The young couple wanting to get their first dog before they start a human family who been told that pit bulls are wonderful with kids

• The person who falls in love with the idea of rescuing an “underdog” with a difficult past

• The young family who goes to adopt a puppy, and are told that breed does not matter

• The person with the big heart who keeps adding more and more dogs to their home, believing that they will all get on, regardless of type and history, if they are simply given enough love

• The caring husband and father who believes that a pit bull will keep his family safe from intruders and be a great companion for the kids

While no one disputes the idea that herding breeds are predisposed to herd, guarding breeds are predisposed to guard, pointers tend to point, retrievers like to hold things in their mouths and terriers like to hunt small critters, for some reason most people do not seem able to accept the fact that dogs that have been selectively bred to fight and kill each other might just be good at doing just that and MORE EASILY drawn into that type of behaviour pattern than another type of dog. This does not mean that these dogs are “evil”, it does not mean that there are absolutely no exceptions, it does not mean that no other type of dog is capable of doing harm to other dogs and it does not mean that a well-managed dog of this type may not make a loving companion for someone who accepts the risks and learns to mitigate them. However, it does mean that for the average person, acquiring a dog of this type is bringing a dog into their home that presents a HIGHER risk than many other types of dogs they could have chosen.

What is most concerning is that the majority of the people who end up in these situations do not intentionally choose this increased risk: they are often kind-hearted people who simply have no idea that the risk exists, because they have been told fairy tales by rescue organisations, believed some nonsense they have seen on TV or had no reason to doubt the “it’s all how you raise them” mantra. This is so grossly unfair and my heart breaks when we have to be the ones to tell caring people hard truths such as that their dogs may never be able to live freely together again, that their dogs fighting poses an enormous risk to their young children and the dogs may need to be rehomed or that they cannot ever let their dog off lead in public or allow it to interact with other dogs again. Few people want to hear these things or live like that.

Few people would ever deliberately choose this reality for themselves, their dogs and their families. Yes, I do realise that there are never any 100% guarantees when getting any dog of any type from any source at any age, BUT are we really going to deny that there are not factors that increase the risk of having a dog with dog-dog aggression? Why would we lie to ourselves and to others? Who are we trying to protect by going along with this – or are we just protecting ourselves from an unpopular and uncomfortable truth?

Is it not time to warn people that acquiring a dog that has been selectively bred for dog-dog aggression (and not defensive type aggression, but rather “gameness” or predatory type aggression) that they are INCREASING THEIR RISK of having a dog that gets into serious fights with other dogs in the home, that does not get along with other dogs at all and that is likely to do very serious damage to other dogs and any humans that happen to get in the way if they do get into a fight? If we kindly warn people and they choose the risk, that is their responsibility, but if we remain silent and they make a choice not knowing the risk, then surely we are partly responsible for the problems they may end up facing. I for one, do not want to bear that responsibility anymore, so I am speaking out motivated by compassion, not judgement  - I hope this post will be received in this way.",8,1730404555.0,BanPitBulls,4,1.0,False

1ggngc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ggngc0/my_brother_is_trash_and_him_and_his_girlfriend/,My brother  is trash and him and his girlfriend are slobs," My brother and I don't have a good relationship even when we were kids and is tolerable at best. To give you an idea of how he treats me is that he charged me $50 to get him to put together my gaming PC. When he was 'obligated' to take our family out for dinner He told me to order something at the max of $10 from the menu. Another time was my mom bought take out food (4pc chicken and noodles with shrimp) and my mom didn't account for his girlfriend being over, my brother took 2 piece of chicken for himself and the other 2 for his girlfriend knowing damn well I can't eat the shrimp noodles because I'm allergic to it. Another time my brother asked if he could borrow $450CAD so he could buy an apple keyboard case. At the time I just got a bonus from work and agreed but whenever I ask him to bring me home like a coffee or a dollar menu burger his reply is always ""pay me back."" I never got to see that $450 back paid in full because when ever I would ask for it he would always  lower the amount by saying ""Oh I only owe you $200 now because x"" "" I only owe you $100 now because of moms birthday gift."" My brother is so shameless even to this day when my mom takes us out to eat and my mom asks if she can try a bit of food that my brother ordered that SHE bought he would be so upset saying ""If you liked it so much you should have ordered it yourself"". For Christmases he's willing to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on his girlfriend yet sets a $50 dollar limit on our mom's Christmas present. Keep in mind he asked for $300 pair of earrings for Christmas from our parents. My parents are very selfless people and to them money isn't an issue, they're content with just knowing that the money they spent brought someone happiness. My parents are aware of my brothers' behavior and have accepted it. We were raised the same way but I can't explain why we are so different as people.

My parents are away on a trip and so our house is a complete utter mess. My brother and his girlfriend are complete slobs! They cook but don't clean the pots and pans they use, they leave the stove and kitchen table a mess. The only time he cleans his dishes is when he has to use it again. For clarification his girlfriend doesn't live with us but she is over very often but she's part of the problem! When she cooks she's the same as my brother she just throws all her shit in the sink and doesn't clean it. My brother leaves his clothes  wherever he pleases and has his backpacks and socks anywhere and everywhere. They study in the kitchen and so I can't even eat properly without having to worry about spilling things on their papers and computers. I asked him can't he just study in his room and his response is that he'll get distracted. Its a valid point but it doesn't mean he can just make things messy. His girlfriend is a kind person for sure but she is messy too, I've been forced to use the basement washroom now because the two of them have taken over the one me and my brother share. She leaves the washroom a mess too with her clothes and hair all over the place I'm the one unclogging the bathtub to get her long hair out. I'm at the point where I'm just staying in my room after work because the mess surroundings in the living room and kitchen just set me in a bad mood.

I want to just want to throw all the dirty dishes on his bed and clothes all over his room but If I do that there will be some punches thrown. But I'm so sick of it. 

My dad told me to endure it and wait for them to get back. You might be wondering how old are they...You'd probably think highschool students but that would be wrong. They're in there last semester as university students.......You also might think I'm the younger sibling, you'd be wrong since I'm the oldest. Yeah its partially my fault for letting him walk over me and believe me I tried to not let that be the case (We got into a fist fight). But ever since he got taller than me and stronger than me it was game over. He has no respect for me. I have a feeling when we're older we will never be talking to each other and our kids will never develop relationships with each other. Unless my brother changes drastically I don't want anything to do with him.

1ggnf7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1ggnf7v/maybe_afrid/,Maybe AFRID?,"Since childhood, somewhere around the age of 8 or 10, I began having an incredibly hard time chewing and swallowing food. It later progressed into struggling to drink any liquid too. My only thought as to why it began is anxiety from experiencing traumatic events. I also recall briefly choking on food in school and I began having to thoroughly chew my food or swishing a drink around until it felt ""right"" to swallow. My mother noticed and tried to help me eat and swallow without the added chewing/swishing, but I was and still am sneaky about it so no one notices. This makes eating out with anyone except my mother a no go, I'll take one or two bites and be done since I'm terrified of judgement. Its come and gone over the years, I went about three years without doing it in my late teen years before I began doing it again. I think it's triggered by anxiety? I'm not sure. I've been diagnosed within the last year with ADHD, anxiety, moderate depression, PTSD, and I'm seeing a rheumatologist soon to discuss an autoimmune disorder. It's a lot but I'm glad to have answers and have a treatment plan. That being said, on top of struggling to swallow food, I've become an incredibly picky eater as well. In a day I'll have coffee, water, yogurt with fruit and granola, usually skip lunch, and I'll eat a plate of fruits, veggies, more yogurt, maybe some cheese and that's it. I'll eat ice cream in the evening too. 

I take a few medications that kill my appetite, but I've found that a lot of food doesn't meet a certain criteria I have and if I begin overthinking, I won't eat. Its become incredibly frustrating for me as I know I'm hungry and need to eat, I also used to love food and making healthy choices.

That being said, I'd love to hear some meal ideas like a dinner or lunch so I can have at least one good meal a day. I'm also interested in hearing how others cope with their eating disorders as well and ways you've found to make sure you have enough nutrients.

I'd like to also add that I'll be talking to one of my Drs soon about this and seeing what else I can do moving forward. It's just a lot and I'm trying to tackle my health problems one thing at a time.

1ggneq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ggneq8/my_brother_yelled_at_me_because_of_a_bathroom/,My brother yelled at me because of a bathroom ,"Throwaway because my friends know my account. My brother (31m) and I (26f) had a complete falling out this morning. We both live with our parents and my sister in law in one house. I'm saving up to move out soon but my brother is most likely going to inherent the house with his wife. 

For some context, my brother and his wife have the master bedroom with their own bathroom. My mom, dad, and I all share a common bathroom in the hallway. My brother and I are the only ones working in the house. 

My mom and dad have given me priority of the bathroom in the morning because I leave for work quite early and the morning is always a rush. We all have an understanding that I need the bathroom for 20 minutes and then it doesn't matter who uses it. This morning my brother was in the bathroom and I was running slightly late. I knocked on the door asking him to come out because I needed the bathroom. He came out after a minute and I asked him why he was using the common bathroom when he has his own bathroom. I did not raise my voice. I wasn't mean about it. His response was to yell at me very loudly about how I am always complaining and whining and then he proceeded to go into his room and slam the door. 

It was extremely jarring to hear such a reaction. When I came downstairs to get my coffee and go, he was acting like nothing happened. He was smiling and happy in front of his wife. I ignored him until he kept on repeating my name. 

That's when everything went downhill. I could feel myself shaking. I let him know that I didn't appreciate how he yelled at me, which caused him to yell at me even more. He described my question as snarky. And I told him in response that it was just a question and it didn't deserve such a response. I let him know that it's frustrating how I can't speak my mind without getting yelled at. This has happened in the past where he'll suddenly become very angry over a small comment. He'll become defensive and go from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye. It's honestly exhausting to keep up with. 

He was yelling while apologizing which made me want to just fall over. 

I feel so stressed bringing up anything because of the backlash. I feel like so uncomfortable in my own home. I keep my distance from everyone now because of the bs and I feel like the bad guy. But honestly it's the only thing bringing me sanity at this point. I love my brother but fuck him for that. ",1,1730404412.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1ggne65,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggne65,2024 EQB 250+: A four month review,"In the beginning of July I received my MY24 EQB 2024 and so far after some 4000 km I'm super happy with the car. I don't know if Mercedes has tweaked the car for the facelift version as I've read some comments on bad quality on rattling interior etc. based on experiences with earlier models but I have nothing to complain there. Obviously it's not a super luxurious interior but come on, what do you expect? I actually like it now more than when I got it and think it's low key nice without a huuge display or ""amazing"" shapes while still being functional and comfortable.


It's not a sports car, again you don't get one of these if that's what you're looking for. But it feels at least as quick and more responsive in practice within legal speeds than my earlier Jaguar XF or Lynk & Co. Above legal limits I would choose the XF any day. The ride is smooth and silent, the cabin is very well noise insulated. It's surprisingly maneuverable in parking halls and old city centres and other more cramped areas.


What the EQB excels in is practicality - I can fit in the boot two large suitcases, a folded full size Cybex baby stroller, couple of separate ""weekend bags"" and still have space for a grocery bag or two. It feels like it has more boot space definitely than the specs somehow - maybe the volume is calculated up to the cargo cover level, which I don't use and because of the very boxy shape there is plenty of usable space above that as well. Example of this is that very similar to above mentioned luggage felt much more tricky to fit in the boot of a Volvo V90 taxi after a flight on a holiday trip and all that went easilly before the flight into the EQB boot.


The front seats are on the firm side of comfortable and I don't get fatigue on longer trips either because of the seats, theres well enough space. I'm 183cm. My wife hasn't complained either when sitting at the back with our 1 year old. I have also good legroom when sitting behind the drivers seat adjusted for myself. From ""luxury"" point of view not having electric seats feels weird and a step down but I pretty much never adjust the driver's seat after it's tuned to my liking so it's a bigger minus on the paper than in reality. 


Range? Absolutely a non issue and why I write about it last. I never run out of battery or feel like it runs out too quick even on longer road trips. I've driven it from Netherlands to Italy and back so far and I have to have a toilet+snack+coffee break well before the battery would be running low and with our kid onboard the breaks need to happen even sooner. Fast charging is available pretty much everywhere and my breaks take long enough to fill in more battery than I consume before I need the next break. I get between 400 and 500 kilometers of range in practice from a full battery, closer to the 400 when more highway and closer to 500 when the trip is more on smaller roads. 


I'm looking towards what happens in the winter as we're planning to drive to the Alps in January. The car is fitted with Michelin all season tires. A ski bag fits in by the way just fine because of the 40:20:40 split folding seats. The extra two third row seats are a nice extra for short local trips if you happen to have guests with a kid or two visiting and don't need to carry luggage at the same time.


I chose 3 year leasing as it just seemed to be cheaper than buying. There were some better leasing deals in NL early this year than right now it seems.


So.. very little to complain and much to be happy about. I happen to like the looks better than ID4 / EV6 / Ioniq5 / Model Y / Q4 / iX1 / iX3. Not the most exciting car in the world either but again you would be looking for something totally different in that case. If you have a family, have a pile of luggage and like to do holiday trips by car instead of public transport like flying or train then EQB is a very good option imho.",4,1730404370.0,mercedes_benz,2,1.0,False

1ggn9v0,https://i.redd.it/rqnfb6onb5yd1.jpeg,got a new kitten over the weekend. my dog will not stop barking at him. please help,"hello there. please be patient and kind. i am learning. i will be posting this in both the cat and dog subreddits. This will be a long post.
i am new to owning a cat while already owning dogs. (but had cats when i was a child). So I’m having an issue. My family and I got a new kitten (male) over the weekend. It was a barn cat, so he definitely was around other (bigger) animals. The ones who sold the kitten did have a dog, but a small chihuahua.
I own 2 dogs. One male German Shepherd (8 y/o) and one female Boston terrier/bulldog mix (5 y/o). We are taking things slow with introducing them. We’ve been keeping them separated. So not fully loose, walking around by themselves yet. I’ll take turns with the animals; I’ll put the dogs outside for a bit while I let the cat roam around the house. If I have the dogs inside, I’ll either wrap the cat in a blanket and hold him, or keep him in a crate (not for long at all), if I need to do other things around the house really quick. (Im home most of the day, so I’m sorta the only one doing most of the work by myself, so it makes it even more difficult.) We don’t really have a free open room available to keep the cat in WITHOUT supervision. (While the dogs stay out). We’ve been keeping all his kitty stuff in the living room. 
So when I have the cat in the blanket in my arms, I will sit on the couch and kinda relax and see how my dogs react. They will sometimes come over to sniff, but other than that, they’ve gotten a lot better with being calm and looking “uninterested”. At one point yesterday, we were all on the couch and our kitten walked over to my German shepherd and fell asleep on him! My German shepherd eventually realized, turned his head quick, but was calm. He let him sleep on him.
But as soon as the cat makes any QUICK movements, the dogs follow suit and want to see what’s up. 
In the very beginning I think both dogs were anxious/scared. I believe they still are, but have gotten a little better. 
Right now, my terrier/bulldog mix is pretty good with the cat. If they are all loose around the house, she listens to my commands when to step away, gives the cat space, etc. The cat does sometimes hiss or growl and if they get a little too close, he does try to paw at them. But I do my best at making sure both animals are as comfortable as they can be, while getting used to each other.
But unfortunately my German shepherd is having a tougher time. At first I felt like he was better than my other dog. Generally speaking, hes a very calm dog. (But also anxious). He’s not super energetic or hyper. Nor have I seen him get aggressive. He is very curious and it just seemed like he’s dying to meet the kitten and play with him. But the more I try to get them around each other without me holding the cat, my german shepherd will chase the cat or bark. The cat will then hide and my dog will bark, wagging his tail. I’m not sure what that could mean. Does he want to play? Is he being aggressive? I’ve noticed that both dogs will actually flinch back quickly if the cat hisses. Even once, seeing the terrier/bulldog shake (scared, I assume).
Today, they were all loose while I was supervising. The cat ran under our coffee table and my dog went over to him and kept barking. I tried to then distract my dogs by putting them outside so the cat could get some space. He did not listen to my commands. Just completely ignored me, and continued to bark at the cat. My other dog was okay. She was sitting on the couch watching. I should also mention, a little bit before this, i was working around the house, walking with the kitten wrapped up. My German shepherd was following us everywhere- up and down the stairs, waiting at the door if we went in a room. He kept staring at the cat. He even went to “nip” at the blanket when the kitten was inside. He would not leave us alone. 
I am so upset. I feel so stressed out and I’ve already cried about it, I don’t want any of my animals feeling rejected or stressed over this situation. Or feeling left out or “punished” in a sense. I love them so much. I know it’s only been a few days, not even a full week. But is this normal? Like I said before, my dog is not aggressive. He’s pretty protective id say. And never had any temperament issues around our other dogs. (Our other passed away last year)
Any advice/help? Thank you so much in advance and thank you for reading. ",1,1730404051.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

i am new to owning a cat while already owning dogs. (but had cats when i was a child). So I’m having an issue. My family and I got a new kitten (male) over the weekend. It was a barn cat, so he definitely was around other (bigger) animals. The ones who sold the kitten did have a dog, but a small chihuahua.
I own 2 dogs. One male German Shepherd (8 y/o) and one female Boston terrier/bulldog mix (5 y/o). We are taking things slow with introducing them. We’ve been keeping them separated. So not fully loose, walking around by themselves yet. I’ll take turns with the animals; I’ll put the dogs outside for a bit while I let the cat roam around the house. If I have the dogs inside, I’ll either wrap the cat in a blanket and hold him, or keep him in a crate (not for long at all), if I need to do other things around the house really quick. (Im home most of the day, so I’m sorta the only one doing most of the work by myself, so it makes it even more difficult.) We don’t really have a free open room available to keep the cat in WITHOUT supervision. (While the dogs stay out). We’ve been keeping all his kitty stuff in the living room. 
So when I have the cat in the blanket in my arms, I will sit on the couch and kinda relax and see how my dogs react. They will sometimes come over to sniff, but other than that, they’ve gotten a lot better with being calm and looking “uninterested”. At one point yesterday, we were all on the couch and our kitten walked over to my German shepherd and fell asleep on him! My German shepherd eventually realized, turned his head quick, but was calm. He let him sleep on him.
But as soon as the cat makes any QUICK movements, the dogs follow suit and want to see what’s up. 
In the very beginning I think both dogs were anxious/scared. I believe they still are, but have gotten a little better. 
Right now, my terrier/bulldog mix is pretty good with the cat. If they are all loose around the house, she listens to my commands when to step away, gives the cat space, etc. The cat does sometimes hiss or growl and if they get a little too close, he does try to paw at them. But I do my best at making sure both animals are as comfortable as they can be, while getting used to each other.
But unfortunately my German shepherd is having a tougher time. At first I felt like he was better than my other dog. Generally speaking, hes a very calm dog. (But also anxious). He’s not super energetic or hyper. Nor have I seen him get aggressive. He is very curious and it just seemed like he’s dying to meet the kitten and play with him. But the more I try to get them around each other without me holding the cat, my german shepherd will chase the cat or bark. The cat will then hide and my dog will bark, wagging his tail. I’m not sure what that could mean. Does he want to play? Is he being aggressive? I’ve noticed that both dogs will actually flinch back quickly if the cat hisses. Even once, seeing the terrier/bulldog shake (scared, I assume).
Today, they were all loose while I was supervising. The cat ran under our coffee table and my dog went over to him and kept barking. I tried to then distract my dogs by putting them outside so the cat could get some space. He did not listen to my commands. Just completely ignored me, and continued to bark at the cat. My other dog was okay. She was sitting on the couch watching. I should also mention, a little bit before this, i was working around the house, walking with the kitten wrapped up. My German shepherd was following us everywhere- up and down the stairs, waiting at the door if we went in a room. He kept staring at the cat. He even went to “nip” at the blanket when the kitten was inside. He would not leave us alone. 
I am so upset. I feel so stressed out and I’ve already cried about it, I don’t want any of my animals feeling rejected or stressed over this situation. Or feeling left out or “punished” in a sense. I love them so much. I know it’s only been a few days, not even a full week. But is this normal? Like I said before, my dog is not aggressive. He’s pretty protective id say. And never had any temperament issues around our other dogs. (Our other passed away last year)

So earlier today during lunch I was taking orders and an old couple comes up to order they ask for an egg blt muffin meal with medium fries and a medium drink and I ring it up and the total comes up to $18.60 (each meal is $8.19 without tax) they complain and say that yesterday they got that same meal for $5 at a different location. I then got my manager they explained to her what they told me and she told them that the muffin by itself is $5.19 and the meal is $8.19 and that prices vary from location. 

So they scrap the egg blt muffin meals and instead get 2 big macs and 2 small coffees. In my store were having a promotion so the 2 small coffees are $1 each not including tax. We also have a deal on the app that you can get a sandwich for $4 so they use that to get one of their big macs for $4. I tell them the total is $13+ and they say okay and pay for it (mind you I told them that the other big mac was $6.69 and they didn't say anything). The lady goes to pay and then I think everything's good. Well I was wrong the man sees the receipt and starts questioning me. I told him that the one big mac is $4 and shows him where that offer is on the receipt. He then got mad that the other big mac is $6.69. I had to get my manager to help out again. Their were multiple people waiting to pay for their kisok orders and place orders behind them. One guy got angry and told them to move to the side to talk it out, and the old man got angry and said that he could stand there all day.

Turns out they wanted to use their points to get a free big mac (not a 100% sure since they never told me that) plus you can only use one code per transaction. My manager ends up refunding them the $6 in cash. Then about 30 minutes later the old man walks up to the counter again and asks for the manager. I get the same manager to talk to him and he goes and tells her ""I saw on your screen (the kisok) the meal and it's $5)"" they talk for a bit and she goes and tells him that's a different meal not what him and his wife wanted. Not sure what happened after that, but I did see the man and his wife in the lobby. I'm just glad my manager wasn't mad at me and stood up for me infront of the customers we even talked about it after and she said that they either got a different item or the cashier who took their order punched it in wrong 

Tldr- old couple get angry about price of their meal and then ask for different items and still get angry about the price. ",3,1730403186.0,McDonaldsEmployees,5,1.0,False

Our family immigrated from SE Asia and have been in the states for over 15 years. I’m (26f) the eldest daughter and has 2 younger siblings (22m and 20m). Like many, my goal after college was always to pay my parents back, traveling with them, and to help out so they don’t have to work as hard anymore. Our most recent trip was to nyc. this was when my frustration towards them grew and I just shut down. 

Despite being in the states this long, the only English they know is strictly related to their jobs. Barely beginner’s level. Years ago, I asked why dont they take free English classes as we live in a big Asian community and my mom just said it’s bc they don’t have time due to working 6 days a week. And this is true, they work very hard, even bought a house, cars, sent us to college, and even family vacation once a year. Plus, I was ok with it since I’ve always believed immigrant parents have it worse. things have been safe to them until now- I’m moving out of their house and across the country for work. They wouldn’t have me around to read/pay bills, make/attend appointments, run errands, take them out, lead them thru airports, translate the menu for them, etc. Knowing this, I’ve been trying to compensate for my absence by teaching key words here and there so they wouldn’t be clueless when the situation arises. However, their dependency becomes more apparent while observing them on our trip. When I was at my breaking point, I calmly mentioned to my mom that the both of them need to go take English classes. Then she joked & said “we’re losing our dictionary”. I didn’t laugh. 

Now, what made me so frustrated during this trip? I was frustrated bc my dad couldn’t even order his regular coffee right. I was frustrated bc my mom asks me the same questions every damn time without trying to learn traffic instructions herself!! Bc they can’t carry a simple exchange in English with strangers, let alone going anywhere/doing anything themselves! God forbid if they’re ever lost, I doubt that they’d even know what to do!!!

You may wonder where are my brothers in all of this. To briefly explain: 1 sibling fought with w our dad & announced that he does not respect him and only help when it comes to our mom, the other sibling is a selfish brat and is never home. Neither one can translate a proper sentence. It feels like I’m in this alone..

Dont get me wrong, my parents do a lot for my siblings and I. Almost above and beyond. They took care of me throughout college, charge cheap rent, and even pay for my insurance. They truly care about my well-being. Idk I guess im looking for validation, but I also feel a deep sense of guilt for writing out my frustration like this.

We tried dating briefly at the beginning of 2020, but the pandemic and a bit of distance created tension. He became distant, I ended things, and eventually, he started dating someone else. A few months later, he called & apologized for how things ended, and we reconnected as friends due to our shared industry, where burning bridges isn’t ideal.

Fast forward four years, and we coincidentally end up living in the same city. We kept bumping into each other at local coffee shops, chatting casually, and decided to reconnect as friends. Over time, we began hanging out more frequently, but it was purely platonic.

A couple of months ago, we were catching up, and he mentioned his dating experiences. How no one was catching his interest. Since we were talking relationships, I told him I’d been in an open relationship, which was getting messy. He just listened, and nothing came of it. A month or two later, I was fresh out of that breakup, though he didn’t know it yet. He then asked me out for drinks as a thank-you for a work favor I’d done for him.

In early October, we got those drinks and had an amazing night out — cocktails, arcade games, a rooftop bar, and a lot of talking. He was noticeably flirty. I eventually confided in him about my recent breakup, but I asked him not to “make it weird.” He got even flirtier. We ended up back at his place, where he touched my legs a bit, but nothing happened. I fell asleep in his bed, and he took the couch.

The following week, I invited him over while I was house-sitting nearby. We stayed up until 2 a.m., watching my favorite movie I told him he HAD to watch. The whole time, he was being flirty, touching my legs, and eventually acknowledging, “I think we’re both trying to figure out what we want here.” I told him I was down to hook up, but made it clear that, fresh out of a breakup, I wasn’t looking for romance. I wanted to set that boundary so he wouldn’t feel pressured into anything more than fun and friendship.

We hooked up that night. A few days later, he invited me to work with him at a coffee shop. He was casual, just talking like a friend. I asked if our hookup had made things weird and suggested that if it did, we didn’t have to do it again. He replied that he actually wanted to “do that a bunch more times.” So, a few days later, we met for drinks, talked, and kept things light. He asked what I was doing for Halloween and I said I was going as Olive from Easy A, and my ‘friend’ was going to be the love interest Woodchuck Todd. He just was quiet at that. There was some talk of hooking up again. He emphasized that he wanted to make sure hooking up wasn’t the ONLY thing we did. So we didn’t that night.

Since then, he’s been texting pretty regularly. It’s flirty and fun, and he’s sent me songs with lyrics that hint at “playing it cool when you like someone,” which felt a bit pointed.

Our most recent hangout felt almost like a date. We grabbed chips and margaritas, went antiquing, flirted, and even made out a bit in the store. He slapped my butt a few times, and when I asked about his dating life, he claimed he wasn’t on the apps at the moment and seeing anyone (which I took with a grain of salt). He did ask if I liked the songs he sent, and I casually said yes, dropping the topic afterward.

Later, we ended up back at his place, hooked up, and then cuddled a bit. He asked for my opinion on his apartment decor as I walked around the place in his shirt, but soon left as he had to be up early for work. Afterward, he texted me saying, “Sorry for the early night! Looks like you left me by my lonesome.” I joked that he “kicked me out,” adding that I wouldn’t have minded staying over. He replied nervously with, “Well, the world’s our oyster! Who knows what the future holds 😅.” I hold him to calm down, I’m just flirting. 

After thinking about it for a few hours, I realized I might actually have a crush on him. To avoid blurring lines further, I decided to be upfront. I texted him saying that I wasn’t sure casual was working for me, admitted I had a small crush, and suggested we take a step back and maybe pause hanging out to keep things simple and respect the friendship.

Now, he hasn’t responded, and I feel like I might have come across as needy. I’m not looking for a declaration of feelings from him, but I want to see if we’re on the same page about keeping things simple and staying friends. Part of me would be thrilled if he said he had a crush on me too, but I’m not expecting that.

All I want is to furnish my house, take care of myself a little. Put some towards my parents medical bills and clear their debt. I’m 27, and I have nothing.

I’ve been living on my own for the past 5 months and I can barely keep up with expenses and taking care of my parents back home. It’s too much. Everything is so expensive. I always have to think 10000 times before 1 small expense, I cannot take it anymore. 

This is a ridiculous wish but I wish someone who has some to spare like a billionaire randomly found me and took pity on me and gave me some money man. 

I’m having a mental breakdown because for Diwali all I wanted to do was deck up a little, get my nails done and just for once, for once buy myself something pretty something new. Or buy the house a coffee table. My apartment has a couch and a mattress. That’s all. That’s how I survive. I saved for some of it but I couldn’t because something came up and I had to send money home. 

I’m tired, I wish adulting was easier. I wish it wasn’t so cruel and harsh. I wish someone would just randomly be an angel and send me some money so I could finish off my parents debt or at least do something nice for myself.

[Rant] ,"TL:DR because this turned into a rant: Have you ever seen a place that had a tea option that was both decaffeinated/noncaffeinated and able to be completely unsweetened?

So my issue I always face at every boba place l've been to so face is that the only non-caffeinated items offered are often very sweet often because the flavoring comes from a powder that already has a lot of sugar in it (winter melon, taro, strawberry, etc.) or straight up sugar. I do not like having ANY added sugar in my drinks because I hate drinking my calories and the milk and tapioca pearls make the tea perfect to me.
So then I should just get the classic teas right? That's fine, I prefer them anyways.

I love tea. However, l'm sensitive to caffeine and it makes me not feel so good. When I need a ""pick me up"" I drink a decaf coffee. When I drink a cup of regular loose-leaf green tea or a double shot of decaf espresso, I feel panicky, paranoid and generally weird in my head and chest. When I drink a boba tea, I have to down like 600mg of L-Theanine to feel okay.

But I really do love the taste and the experience of boba tea. So much so that I've ordered decaffeinated matcha powder and herbal/decaffeinated teas to make my own at home. But I still like to go to the boba shop like with friends, I just drink half of mine and then let my boyfriend or friend drink.

Would it be so hard for boba places to carry at least one herbal tea???? 😭",3,1730402730.0,boba,3,1.0,False

With roots in ancient pottery and modern design, ceramic goods have evolved to enhance our daily lives and living spaces. House of Ceramic is committed to elevating this art form, providing customers with handcrafted ceramic pieces that combine artistry with functionality.

**The Allure of Boutique Ceramics**

What makes boutique ceramics so special? [**Boutique ceramic products**](https://www.houseofceramic.com/) are distinct because they focus on small-batch, handcrafted production. Rather than being churned out by machines, each piece is typically made by skilled artisans who invest hours in shaping, firing, and glazing ceramics. This process adds an irreplaceable human touch, resulting in products that radiate character and quality. House of Ceramic understands the value of this approach, offering a collection of items that aren’t just beautiful to look at but also incredibly functional.

Ceramic products have a way of blending seamlessly into various decor styles, from minimalistic and modern to rustic and traditional. Boutique ceramics elevate interior design by offering unique textures, colors, and forms. A hand-glazed vase, a carefully crafted dinnerware set, or even a small decorative accent can add that final touch of sophistication to any space.

**Product Range at House of Ceramic**

House of Ceramic brings a versatile range of boutique ceramic products to cater to diverse tastes and preferences. Whether you’re looking for timeless dinnerware, decorative sculptures, or elegant tiles, their offerings are carefully curated to fit into modern aesthetics and traditional homes alike.

1. **Dinnerware Collections**

Perfect for those who appreciate detail and elegance, the dinnerware at House of Ceramic ranges from earthy, rustic designs to sophisticated, modern pieces. Handmade plates, bowls, and serving dishes not only make a meal look inviting but also bring a sense of occasion to everyday dining. Each piece is crafted to balance durability with delicate beauty, making them perfect for both daily use and special occasions.

1. **Decorative Vases and Sculptures**

For those who want to introduce artistic accents into their homes, House of Ceramic’s decorative items offer endless possibilities. The collection includes vases and sculptures in various forms, colors, and textures, each piece acting as a standalone work of art. These items are ideal for adorning shelves, tables, and entryways, instantly elevating any room's decor with their understated elegance.

1. **Handmade Tiles**

Tiles play a significant role in creating a specific mood in a space, and handmade ceramic tiles from House of Ceramic bring warmth and originality. Whether you’re looking to renovate a kitchen, bathroom, or outdoor area, these tiles add personality with their artisanal finishes and distinctive patterns. Their durability ensures that they are not just beautiful but also practical and long-lasting.

1. **Gift-Worthy Ceramics**

With a selection of unique mugs, bowls, and decorative items, their ceramics make for thoughtful presents that can be cherished for years. Each piece is crafted with the intention of creating something personal and lasting, making these gifts a fantastic way to show appreciation.

**Why Choose Boutique Over Mass-Produced?**

When you invest in boutique ceramics, you're not just purchasing a product; you're supporting an entire tradition of craftsmanship. Mass-produced ceramics, while convenient and affordable, lack the same level of artistry and durability as handcrafted items. Here’s why boutique ceramics from House of Ceramic are a worthwhile choice:

* **Quality and Durability**: Boutique ceramics undergo a meticulous production process, resulting in pieces that are not only more aesthetically pleasing but also more durable. House of Ceramic’s items are made with high-quality materials, ensuring that each piece will stand the test of time.
* **Sustainability**: Smaller production batches are often more sustainable, creating less waste and reducing the environmental impact. Artisans and brands like House of Ceramic are mindful of their production processes, making efforts to use sustainable materials and methods whenever possible.
* **Individuality**: Since each boutique ceramic item is handmade, no two pieces are identical. This level of uniqueness allows customers to own something truly special, as opposed to generic, mass-produced items that lack character.
* **Support for Artisans**: By choosing boutique ceramic products, you are supporting the livelihood of skilled artisans. House of Ceramic partners with artisans who pour their passion and expertise into their work, allowing customers to feel more connected to the origins of the products they purchase.

**Incorporating Boutique Ceramics into Your Home**

Integrating boutique ceramics into your home decor is a rewarding experience, as these items lend both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Here are some ideas on how to incorporate House of Ceramic’s products into your space:

* **Elevate Your Dining Experience**: Switch out your standard tableware with beautifully crafted ceramic plates, bowls, and mugs. Even a simple breakfast feels luxurious when served in quality ceramics. House of Ceramic’s dinnerware sets are versatile enough for both casual and formal settings, making them perfect additions to any kitchen.
* **Create a Focal Point with Decorative Pieces**: A strategically placed vase or sculpture can act as a focal point in a room. Place a unique vase from House of Ceramic on a coffee table or a bookshelf, and watch how it instantly enhances the ambiance of the room.
* **Upgrade Your Walls with Ceramic Tiles**: Instead of traditional wall art, consider decorating your kitchen backsplash, bathroom, or even a fireplace with handmade ceramic tiles. The texture, pattern, and color of these tiles add depth to any wall, transforming it into a statement feature.

**Maintaining the Beauty of Your Ceramics**

Caring for boutique ceramics is essential to preserve their beauty and functionality over time. Hand-wash items like mugs and plates whenever possible to prevent damage from harsh dishwasher cycles. For decorative pieces, a gentle dusting or wiping with a soft cloth helps maintain their shine. House of Ceramic’s products are made to last, but a little extra care goes a long way in ensuring they remain as beautiful as the day you brought them home.

**The Timeless Appeal of Boutique Ceramics**

Boutique ceramics are more than just objects—they are expressions of art, history, and craftsmanship. In a fast-paced world filled with disposable goods, choosing handcrafted ceramics is a way to embrace slower living and meaningful connections with the items we use daily. House of Ceramic’s boutique collection provides a range of options for anyone looking to add depth and sophistication to their living spaces.

If you’re looking to elevate your home decor or find a thoughtful gift, [**House of Ceramic**](https://www.houseofceramic.com/)’s boutique ceramic products offer timeless elegance that goes beyond mere functionality. With a commitment to artistry, quality, and sustainability, their ceramics bring a sense of authenticity and warmth to any space.

(idk what to tag as),"You know, it *all started* with “brain rot,” right? You see it on every post: “Ha ha, my brain is so fried from scrolling this app for hours like a literal zombie, someone put me in a museum for posterity.” And then, just when you think you’re out, BAM!—another 17-foot bacon sandwich hits the café circuit, like some kind of towering pink monstrosity. “Oh, it’s *quirky*, it’s *wacky*, it’s totally 2024!” someone screams, with the full volume of their Instagram captions. **WRONG.**

People think it’s a game, these sandwiches. But it’s more than that. It’s the *culmination* of every TikTok dance, every “Bing Bong” catchphrase, every poorly cropped meme from 2008. Think about it: one minute you’re just minding your own business, “taking a break” on your phone, the next minute, your friend’s tagging you in a picture of a sandwich so tall it has its own weather pattern. And you think, “Wow, this is totally normal.” But it’s NOT NORMAL, is it?? **17 feet of bacon?!** Just... why? Are we really meant to believe these sandwiches aren’t secretly the main players in a corporate scheme to brainwash the masses into buying more overpriced coffee? And yet, every other day, some influencer in rainbow leggings climbs atop one of these monstrosities to “get that perfect angle,” like they’re a modern-day sandwich conqueror.

And the rants, oh—the rants! Like, when did we all become so aggressively *for* or *against* sandwiches? I mean, just look at the comment sections under any café post. It’s all “#TeamBacon #17FeetForever,” or you get the self-proclaimed intellectuals with their “Guys, I think we should really examine how bacon sandwiches fit into late-stage capitalism.” WHAT?!? Meanwhile, the sandwich is just... there. Just sitting there, not paying rent, not contributing to society, just existing, with 17 feet of crispy bacon stacked like a tower of lies.

Oh, and don’t even get me started on the “deep” interpretations of it all. You’ve got the galaxy-brained takes: “Actually, the sandwich represents the weight of modern meme culture on our social psyche.” OH, REALLY? Because I thought it represented exactly what it was: *a giant sandwich.* I don’t know about you, but I’m not about to let a sandwich determine my worldview! It’s 17 feet tall! That’s not a symbol of anything; it’s just excessive pork products! You want symbolism? Try staring at your phone screen for four hours straight until it blurs and see if you feel enlightened.

And don’t pretend there’s some kind of complex philosophy behind it, either. It’s not “post-ironic surrealism” just because you slapped a pickle on it and called it “avant-garde cuisine.” It’s bacon! The sandwich doesn’t have feelings, and it definitely isn’t leading a social revolution. And yet, here we are, a bunch of keyboard warriors shouting “My sandwich could beat up your sandwich,” like we’re in some kind of culinary Hunger Games, fighting for relevance on a planet that’s one cat meme away from total collapse.

So anyway, I was trying to order a coffee the other day, just minding my own business, and then this guy next to me whispers, “Hey, have you heard about the new 18-foot-tall ham-and-cheese monstrosity down the street?”

AND THAT’S WHEN I REALIZED. The bacon sandwiches are evolving. They’re breeding, growing taller, like skyscrapers of meat. We are witnessing the dawn of a new epoch. Soon, they’ll reach the ceiling.",1,1730402151.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for a protein powder that mixes well into hot liquids (e.g. coffee, tea, hot juice) or granola+milk/porridge without changing the taste of the drink/food much. I've been looking at unsweetened ones as I've got a feeling chocolate/vanilla powders etc would change the taste of said drinks and food too much.

Also, I'm looking for a powder that uses as few ingredients as possible / doesn't have sweeteners etc.

Lastly I can have a jippy stomach at times. Would prefer a powder that seems to 'agree' with digestive systems the most.

Given all of the above, I'm looking at pea and rice powders - I thought they might be gentlest on jippy digestion.

Currently looking at Naked brand Brown Rice or Pea protein. I like that those seem to have just one ingredient, but they are pricey, and no idea. Also looking at Bulk brand Pea or Rice, which are cheaper but I've seen comments that they have more ingredients than are written on the packet, so not sure I trust them.

To be clear, I don’t want any rubbing at full turn. I also don’t want to make any modifications (cutting, heat gun, etc). I plan to rolling with the stock suspension. I’m not opposed to swapping out the notorious bolts in the front wheel wells for flatheads.

**Hey everyone!**

So this is going to be a longer(er) post because this is something I hold *very near and dear to myself.* What I have created is in the title. This is my biggest project which I am most proud of yet. I have built 10s of projects over my computer science career during college, and while some have been much more technically difficult, this one means the most to me because it is mine. I do thank you for reading this for even looking at this post.

# The Problem

So we have all had this dilemma of which members should be given those **beautiful** bonus medals after the end of that torturous CWL week. You know, it is important to give these out fairly because it is an impression of who the leaders who and how they recognize fair and hard work. As a member, it is motivating to know that you earned something, and you received a reward for it. Furthermore, especially for strategic rushers, those medals are immensely important for saving time and optimal progress. *Plus, who doesn't want a nice book of building?)*

But it seems that the CWL rankings are quite limited and don't feel accurate on ranking who ACTUALLY deserves those bonus medals.

So when I first got back into CoC again, my friend Logan (the leader of the clan) and I found this issue, and decided we needed a more systematic way of at-least gaining **some** idea of who deserves what, which is more accurate than the in-game ranking system. So we went to brainstorming.

# The Solution

**At first,** we developed an equation (much simpler than the algorithm that ended up evolving out of it), that took into account the further additional metrics: **Donations, Alt Accounts, and Alt Account Performance**. On top of that, we though that some of the main metrics (**stars, destruction percentage, attack used**) needed weight, as we felt subjectively that some parameters meant more than others. So we formulated an equation with customizable weights for this equation. It was a very pen-and-paper system, and was super manual, but for many months (October 2023 - March 2023), it works so well with us and it got some nice feedback.

By April 2024, I had just finished my Junior year in college, and was really brainstorming something for project-based learning, even on top of the quantum computing research I was going to do over the summer. At this point an idea popped into my head and I brough it up to logan:

""Hey, Logan, why don't I make this a website, and other clans and members are even able to use this themselves. They'll be able to use their own subjective parameters and equations, and it'll be something nice to give back to the CoC community?""

**So I got to work**, and started studying lots of different technical processes to build a full-stack web application. I got to building the backend and creating a more robust algorithm (which you can see on the site). During this summer I was very busy, studying quantum computing for my research assistantship, building a portfolio website concurrently, and also studying this. It was a lot, but this truly took most of my dedication.

I built the backend with Spring Boot (Java), built the front-end with React, Tailwind, Next.js, Dockerized the backend, deployed it on AWS, hosted the front-end on Vercel, and used common CI/CD practices.

I also extended the functionality of the base algorithm and formula we had, adding many more parameters, thresholds, and weights, all customizable and friendly to the user. Currently, the algorithm calculates a bonus score for each member based on their performance in Clan War Leagues. The key components considered in the score calculation are **stars earned**, **attacks used**, **destruction percentage**, **donations**, and the **relative Town Hall level shift** among every participant per war (i.e. War 1 everyone on average attacked +2 TH levels above themselves). Additionally, the algorithm accounts for alt accounts and calculates an extra bonus based on their performance.

Again, all of these weights and thresholds are **customizable**, so you can use our default settings, or come up with another differently weighed algorithm that your clan may agree on is better.

Then, at this point with a lot of small nuance and fixed, I finally completed the **first release** of my web application, and **deployed it**.

# Completion, Feedback, and Gratitude

As I have said before, this project means a lot to me, and I really hope other people can get as much value that I feel my clan and my friends do. I intend on supporting this with my own money, so there is a Buy me a Coffee link on the site if you want to help support it and keep it up.

I also intend on putting this project on my résumé, as it will be immensely important in landing a job in the uber-competitive field of software engineering. So even just checking out the website would mean a lot, as I can put visit analytics and stats on my résumé, and it would be much better.

**If there is any feedback you guys want to give, please do!** There is a feedback form on my website, but also feel free to just write your thoughts in the comments. Positive feedback or constructive criticism are all welcomed.

I really do thank you for reading this far, I really do want to give back to the CoC community, and I hope this is just one way I can help everyone. I mixed two passions of mine (software engineering and gaming), and feel that I am helping people with it, so I am proud of what this website has come to.

**Thank you again.**

My partner and I are childfree. We were always stumped when people asked us why we don’t have kids. We never really had a reason. In fact, we both believe that you need reasons only when you do something that alters your state of being. We don’t really need a reason to just remain the same. We do however understand that when something is a given, people want to know why we are not following it. But in other situations, they are content with the lack of reasons.

Eg:

Colleague: Come on, let’s get some coffee.

Me: I don’t drink coffee.

Colleague: Why not?

Me: <shrugging>

Colleague: Okay. Let me get mine.

But we can’t shrug it off, when the question is “Why don’t you have kids?”. Even though the real answer is just that we don’t have a reason. We just never found a reason to HAVE kids. 

How is it with the rest of you folks? Do you have a reason to not want/have kids? Did you have to manufacture reasons (like we did) when the question was asked? Or do you really have strong (or even weak) reasons to not want kids?

throwaway account because i’m too scared to post on my main. i apologize in advance because this will probably be a long post, but i would really appreciate the advice or stories from people with similar experiences. 

i (F23) have been with my partner (M27) for 4.5 years. We currently live together (renting) and have two dogs. I have been experiencing thoughts of doubt for a long time and have just started to become aware of the cycle. For a while I will have doubts, we’ll argue & end up reconciling, & then doubts go away. until they creep back in. so here goes. 

i have felt for a long time that my partner is essentially a dependent. i do all the cooking (he claims he can’t cook ANYTHING given he undercooked chicken 2 years ago & got food poisoning… i think i should add we do have a meat thermometer), majority of cleaning, daily housework, 99% of the laundry is done by me, & i am sole caretaker of our dogs (he might take them potty once or twice every few days but it’s primarily always me feeding them, bathing them, stimulating them, scheduling vet appts, etc.). i also do all of the grocery shopping, meal planning, & keep track of all of our bills. we split bills 50/50, but i often find myself spending more than him on groceries. 

now i want to kind of start of by saying it’s not that i necessarily mind doing those things; i enjoy cooking (it’s a hobby of mine) & not to toot my own horn but im fairly good at it. i like cleaning a lot because it’s a great way to decrease my anxiety. however it’s started to bother me a lot recently because he just doesn’t take initiative to do anything. he will pile trash on top of the trash can to the point it’s overflowing on the floor, doesn’t cook (will literally complain about being hungry for 2+ hours and ask me what i plan on making), doesn’t take initiative to go to the grocery when we’re low on coffee, coffee creamer, etc (for example there have been times he will use the rest of the creamer & just not tell me, so when i go to make a cup of coffee i’m disappointed to find there’s no creamer), lets laundry pile up & overflow, doesn’t pick up dog poop when he DOES take the dogs out (there is literally a separate document we signed that states we must clean up after them or else we could face a fine/eviction), doesn’t do dishes even if i spend 1+ hours making our meals, doesn’t know when bills are do, leaves his trash or dirty dishes in various places, leaves shoes & dirty clothes in the middle of the floor, basically the list could go on. i will note that he has ADHD & executive dysfunction has always been a struggle for him. he is medicated but i don’t think this can all be blamed on ADHD. 

the real kicker here is that i work three fucking jobs: i’m an intern working 20 hours a week, a full time grad student taking classes 12 hours a week, & i also have a part time job at a coffee shop where i work an additional 20 hours a week. not to mention tacking on homework, projects, exams, papers, documentation for my internship, & preparing for my licensure exams when i am at home. he works a varied schedule, where one week he works 60 hours, at work 5 days a week, then the next week he works 24 hours, at work 2 days a week. he works overnights so he is usually up between 2pm - 6am, even on his days off. he’s graduated college & doesn’t have obligations outside of work or scheduled quarterly trainings. 

i would like to add i’ve had multiple conversations with him. each time it always ends in a huge fight. he is so verbally aggressive when he’s angry, often telling me that i’m lying & he does more than i claim (which i am being so fucking for real he doesn’t. i will die on that hill), i don’t appreciate him, he shouldn’t have to change his whole life for me, we work different schedules, calls me names, etc. these fights typically go on for several days until he ultimately tells me how very sorry he is & how he will be so much better. it’s been like this since we moved in together in 2022. 

i am not going to lie in this post, i am so fucking depressed and overwhelmed. there is so much chaos in my life right now between work and school and my internship and then being the manager of the house that i just literally want to run away & never speak to anyone again. i am so burnt out, i am rageful half the time, & i am SO bitter. 

i know that within all of this it’s probably self explanatory: duh, leave. i have so much awareness regarding this situation; i deserve better, i dont want this forever, someone will give me what im looking for & more without me having to ask, he’s taking advantage of me, i know it all. but how do i leave? i am so broke due to being a grad student, i can’t afford to break my lease & live on my own, my parents are 2+ hours away & i have to be at my internship 5 days a week, and we have 2 dogs together that i know he will fight me on despite not taking care of them. i just don’t know what to do. i feel so hopeless, as if this is just the life i’m destined to have. not the victim mentality of woah is me but just like “how can i even get out of this?” 

i feel like the only time i notice him doing “more” is when he wants to have sex. like this was my breaking point: monday he did the dishes, had sex with me, sat down & played xbox for the rest of the night. didn’t tell me goodnight or anything. hasn’t touched anything in the house since. that’s when i really just sat back & realized, wow, there’s no way this dude actually gives a single fuck about me. he just likes that he gets a home cooked meal every night, always has clean laundry, never has to lift a finger, & gets laid. & it just made me feel so objectified and worthless. 

he’s never told me that he *expects* these things out of me, or that he views it as my “role” but that’s how i feel at this point. and i just need some words of encouragement, harsh truth, or just some advice. if you read this far, thank you. ",2,1730401345.0,relationship_advice,24,0.67,False

In previous blog, we talked about how the AI system help with generating cards. Today, let's change the topic and dive into the art design of our game! Card games are a visual feast as they require countless illustrations for each card. This workload is no joke, our art leader would have to drink all the coffee in the office to get through it, not to mention the rest of other art tasks. On the other hand, we want players to have that DIY fun, making each card their own piece of art. So, after many discussions, we decided to take a shot at using AI to generate cart art.

Dreams are nice, but reality bites... At first, the illustrations generated by the AI system were... well, let's say, not quite there. We fed it tons of materials, optimized algorithms, and designed art styles for different in-game skills. After a lot of trials and tribulations, and with designers pulling their hair out, we finally got the results we wanted.

**Chapter theme:** [**Labrinth - Kill For Your Love (Official Video) - YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afql9dbjcq0)

**Chapter 40.**

**Vindicator.**

We took our time approaching the Velas estate, gradually building up our anticipation for the rampage we'd soon unleash. Along the way, I told Rachel everything I learned earlier from Anikka, which in turn enraged her and made her eager for the upcoming confrontation.

“All the manipulation, and cowardice, I just can’t stand it,” she said vehemently. “Hiding behind money and influence and throwing away lives. Who could stand to be around such people? That’s why I told Cross I couldn’t join the Valkyries.”

“Oh, is that what she wanted to discuss with you?” I asked.

*“Yeeeah,”* Rachel said sourly. “I mean it was flattering, right? An elite group of all-female fighters renowned throughout the nation. It sounds great! But having to do so in the service of this pathetic society of backstabbing snakes? I just can’t. Working for the establishment holds no appeal.”

“Did Cross take your answer well?” I wondered.

“She thinks she can still win me over,” Rachel said. “I might have to mesmerize her into backing off.”

“Working in general is for lesser beings, anyway. I’m disappointed she thought she could make a *coworker* of you. We, the night’s nobility, have no need to *toil,”* I said haughtily.

“That is so snobby,” she snickered.

“It’s only snobbery if you’re rude about it,” I corrected her.

\_\_

Once we arrived at the Velas estate, the two of us were quick to let loose our shared displeasure with how Anikka had been treated. At this point I feel there was no need to go into an overly descriptive recounting of the response of the security forces that pitted themselves against us, nor the many, many instances that followed in which we maimed and murdered the lot of them without mercy.

While I realize that I haven’t been that sparing in such details before, this time around was a little different due to our raised ire. Today, Rachel and I were especially…unpleasant in our method of dispensing with those doomed, brave souls.

It was a real scene, all right.

The scene of a *massacre.*

There was a time that I feared taking the lives of other hunters due to the system rules forbidding conflict between our kind. After all, killing them could eventually get us labeled by the system with the dreaded title of **\[Player Killer\],** which would leave us unable to live in civilized lands and would have placed a permanent bounty on our heads as an incentive for others to kill us.

That was before I realized that our **\[True Vampirism\]** trait essentially negated such a dire outcome. When Rachel and I were in our human forms, the penalties could apply only then. But when we acted as vampires, the system regarded us as monsters. Why would monsters be penalized for acting according to their nature?

It was pretty much a license to kill. Thank goodness Rachel and I were such thoughtful and responsible people who would never even consider abusing such a massively unfair advantage.

“Kyler!” Rachel laughed. “Did you see me rip that one in half? Oh, wow, look at him! He’s trying to crawl away! That’s so gross! I’m going to step on his head.”

Yep. Just a couple of good-natured people out to have a little fun.

It was a shame that Thalia and Patrick weren’t here to share in the fate of their men. Those two were the ones I wanted most of all. I wish I’d thought to confirm their presence before beginning our attack, but it was too late now.

Oh, well. We’d just have to save that particular gratification for a future date.

Once we finished with their outside forces, we smashed our way inside the main house where the elite among them awaited us. After our introductions were made, each side spoke a few monologues and delivered a few thinly veiled threats before squaring up to fight; you know, the usual routine that happens when colorful warriors and deadly monsters decide to clash.

I found it all rather rote, personally speaking, having endured such rituals many times before, but Rachel was bright-eyed with enchantment for the proceedings, having never thrown down with these sorts of characters before. Since it was all still new to her, I refrained from giving any derogatory commentary, not wishing to stymie her enjoyment. In fact, I let her take them all on by herself, while I sought out the master of the estate.

He was the one I truly had business with.

In a way, every misfortune I’d suffered this year all came back to him. Whatever his reasons, he’d been an absolute thorn in my side. And now he was going to pay for it.

How sad that he was so unreceptive to my overtures of friendship when I finally tracked him down.

“Greetings, my lord. Allow me to give you my warmest regards,” I said to him in a jovial manner. “Are you as happy to meet me as I am to finally meet you?”

“And who the hell are you supposed to be?” asked Lord Velas with a ferocious looking scowl.

“Oh, come now, my identity shouldn’t be a surprise to you,” I said as I stepped closer so he could see me. “Not to the master of the great Velas family. Not to the man with his fingers on the scale and his nose in everyone’s business. Of course you know me!”

*“Kyler Evans?”* he asked in surprise before scoffing at the name. “I knew you recently came scurrying back into the city, but I had no idea you’d be so foolish as to—”

“No,” I said, raising a hand to silence him.

“No?” he asked with a puzzled expression.

“I didn’t *scurry* back anywhere,” I informed him. *“Vermin* scurry. *Insects* scurry. *I* came into town in a *limo.* Get it right.”

“I’m sorry, are you completely mental? What the *fuck* are you doing in my home?” Lord Velas asked angrily.

“Claiming it,” I explained. “Everything here will now be mine, by right of conquest. Your remaining men, your resources, the clothes on your back, the money you’ve saved, I’m taking *everything* from you\*.\* Would you like to try disputing my claim?”

“I’d very much like to see you try!” he yelled. “You can’t just steal everything from me and expect to get away with it, you insolent cur! The entire nobility of all three cities will rise against you!”

“There’s no need to take that tone, sir. Men of our ilk shouldn’t argue,” I said. “Despite our many differences, you and I have much in common. Like you, I was a terrible father that failed my children miserably.”

“What insane drivel are you spouting?” Velas said with a sneer.

“Only the truth,” I sighed. “You must know that a father who fails at his duty will eventually make enemies of his own children. You’re lucky that only one of your daughters turned on you.”

Lord Velas glared at me for a moment before saying, “Anikka,” spitting the word out as though it were a curse.

“Correct,” I said with a nod. “Your daughter and I recently reconnected. She feverishly affirmed her passionate devotion to me and begged for my protection from you. As a gentleman, how could I resist?”

“That ungrateful little *bitch,”* he swore. “How many times must she defy me?”

“Just this once was enough,” I said. “I swear I tried to be logical about this! But who could resist someone as beautiful as your girl? My head said no, but my heart said kill you and plow her in your bed.”

“COME AT ME, THEN!” Lord Velas shouted as red electrical energy enveloped his body and exploded outward, destroying everything around him in a shower of surging sparks and eradicating light. “You presume to challenge me? You want to take what’s mine? Come forth you little bastard and I’ll bury you like just every other fool who dared to face me!”

“Your electrical light effects aren’t going to save you, sir,” I said as I walked toward him. “This isn’t a duel, this is *banditry.* I’m taking everything that you value. The only thing I *won’t* do is let you die quickly. That’s the price you’ll pay for laying a finger on Kyler Evans.”

“You shouldn’t have gotten involved with my daughter,” he said remorselessly.

“Then you shouldn’t have stood in her way,” I replied. “Clipped wings can never soar.”

“She is *MINE!* My property to do whatever I want with!” Velas ranted. “As worthless as she was, the little whore should have been grateful that I found a good use for her! But instead, she defied me! And over what? A misfire like you? A goddamned *porter?* The jest went too far! A lesson needed to be taught!”

“She said my brother and Thalia were hurting her. Do you understand the implications contained in that sentence? How could you let that happen?” I asked him.

“What business is it of mine how your brother enjoys his cut of meat?” Lord Velas sneered.

In the blink of an eye, I was across the room, standing before him. Lord Velas only had time to blink once and flinch, before my fist punched through his chest all the way up to my elbow. When I removed it with a wet *plopping* sound, he dropped to his knees with a newly placed sucking wound at the center of his torso.

“Why did you make me do that? I was going to play with you a bit first,” I asked him.

Bloody saliva dribbled down his chin as he stared at me with a dazed expression. “Dally ges bru-bles-guuu?” he babbled incoherently before he began weeping when his adrenalin faded, and the pain kicked in.

“Oh, this displeases me greatly,” I said unhappily. “I’ll say this for you, old mortal, you possess an *excellent* gift for provocation. You managed to colossally piss me off and in I went! Now look at what a mess you are. The amount of blood I would have to give you to heal this wound so I could resume killing you properly, would surely transform you into a thrall, and I do *not* want to hear any of your thoughts in my mind. Oh, how annoying!”

“Haaaaaaweeeeehh!” screeched Lord Velas.

“Yes, yes, very interesting,” I replied as I knelt to face him. “Listen, if the subject ever gets brought up in hell, you’ll tell everyone I tortured you to death, right? It would really help my reputation.”

Lord Velas grunted another nonsensical barrage of word salad as I raised my hand and prepared to tear off his head.

“Hold on, Kyler!” Rachel said suddenly as she ran into the room, fresh from crushing the elite guard. “Don’t be in such a hurry!” she said.

“Hmm?” I asked as she rushed past me while biting a fresh wound into her palm so that she could feed her blood into the old man’s mouth by hand.

“Rachel? I very much want this wretched man dead so would you please explain your reasoning here?” I asked her with a raised brow.

“Ha! And you’re always calling *me* too hasty,” Rachel snorted as Lord Velas’ wound healed and the process of enthrallment began to overtake his body. “Come on! This bastard is still much too useful to kill outright. Even I can see that.”

“What’s your plan?” I asked, once I saw how seriously she was taking this.

“I’m so glad you asked!” she said giddily as she watched the old man’s body spasming from the effects of her blood. “Check this out. First, I’m forcing him to become our lesser kin.”

“So, I see,” I said. “But what’s your next move after that?”

“I’ll order him to disinherit Thalia and Patrick and make Anikka the heir to the household. I’ll also force him to adopt us into the Velas family. *Lady Rachel Velas.* Doesn’t that sound like a wonderful name?”

I let out a low whistle of appreciation at the sinister depths of my child’s insidious cunning. “Rachel, does this mean you’ve been paying attention to my rambling lectures about the virtues of Machiavellianism?”

“Well, your speeches *do* get so long-winded that it’s hard not to absorb a few good ideas,” she admitted. “I mean, I’ll always prefer directly tearing my enemies apart over ensnaring them in a shadowy scheme but come on! This is too good an opportunity to screw over too many people that deserve it.”

“Men like Duke Velas have a great many connections to influential members of society,” I cautioned her. “Taking this route is the same as painting a target on our backs and daring our enemies to shoot.”

“Cool,” said Rachel. “Then let’s start a civil war and burn this place to the ground. If they’re going to be a bunch of whiney children over one of them getting the proper slapping he deserved, then fuck it. Let’s kill them all. Even better: let’s make them kill *each other.”*

The demented grin now lighting up my daughter’s face made my heart sing with joy. Why had I ever been so frightened by the notion that I had poorly influenced her character? This was how she wanted to be! These were *her* choices!

Rachel liked who she was. And I had been a fool to assume I had somehow corrupted her. She was a rare soul who found freedom through darkness, not despair. Who was I to assume I had any part in the development of her twisted values? She was her own woman.

And I was proud of her.

I swept an arm around her shoulders and pulled her in for a crushing embrace before saying, “I love how twisted your mind has become, daughter. More so than any of my children of birth, I think you best reflect the mad virtues of our sacred bloodline. I dearly look forward to seeing how high you’ll rise.”

“Kyler, *stop*,” Rachel said with a blush. “You’re embarrassing me in front of my new thrall.”

On the floor, Lord Velas continued to tremble and groan.

“I can’t help it!” I said merrily. “Papa’s so proud of his devious little angel! Everyone come take a look at the future tyrant I helped raise! From this moment on I’ll tell everyone I meet that I knew you before you were infamous!”

*“Daaad!”* she squeaked.

I think I felt my undead heart skip a beat.

Metaphorically, that is.

“Is that the first time you ever called me that without being sarcastic?” I gasped.

Were my eyes beginning to water?

I think they were!

“My little girl loves her father!” I sighed.

“Shut up!” Rachel groaned.

“She called me dad! My daughter called me dad!” I shouted jubilantly at the estate. “Did everyone who’s left alive hear that? My child finally acknowledged me! Oh, is this how nirvana feels?”

“Kyler, shut up!” Rachel shouted as she swung an armored fist at my face, which I merrily dodged by jumping into the air and floating just out of reach.

“It’s too late, Rachel! The gate once opened can never again be sealed!” I said tauntingly as I shot outside through a window and continued to crow my pleasure to the world.

In response, Rachel flew into the sky to chase wildly after me with murder blazing in her eyes. And that was how we spent a few pleasant hours playing in the darkness over our newly acquired estate. Enjoying a delightful game of tag far above the broken bodies and ruined minds of those who had tried to oppose us.

Later, we returned to Anikka with both the good news of our overwhelming victory, and our sincere congratulations over her becoming her family’s heir. She was dazed at first, but quickly warmed up to the incredible change in her status. When we informed her that she had also acquired two new siblings by adoption, as well as a very clever dog and whatever Orby was supposed to be, she seemed almost overwhelmed.

Rachel, who had grown up on a farm with many sisters, was delighted to have acquired a new one in Anikka, and didn’t hesitate to embrace her as kin. Anikka, who had never known the genuine love of family was put off by Rachel’s forwardness at first, but it didn’t take long for my daughter to win her over.

The pair of them are now thick as thieves. The common ground they shared at being selfishly used by others for the entirety of their lives was strong enough to cement an unbreakable friendship. Although Rachel and I agreed for the time being to keep the secret of our vampirism to ourselves, lately she had been giving me hints that she wanted to take Anikka as a child of her own.

I’m reluctant to allow it, but Rachel has proven herself to be a powerful and resourceful vampire. As her strength grows, so will her ambitions and her desire for a family of her own. It would be wrong to oppose that out of a selfish desire to keep her to myself.

I’ve become very fond of her, but the primary task of a parent is to protect his children until they’re strong enough to stand on their own. And once they’ve achieved that strength, it was best to stand aside while they made their own decisions.

If I was being more honest with myself, I’d admit that the primary source of my reluctance had nothing to do with Rachel at all. Without going overmuch into detail, I’ve explained to Anikka that I’m not the man she once loved. That only his body remained, and while I was willing to reciprocate her affection to a degree, it was impossible for me to truly feel for her as he once had.

At the time, I thought she took my revelation calmly. I felt relief that she finally understood and could move on with her life. But lately, when she thinks I don’t notice, she looks at me with an expression filled with such longing that I can’t help but pity her for what had been stolen from her.

What misery it is to be human and know loss.

Patrick and Thalia, who only survived because they happened to be abroad on the night of our attack, did not take the news of their disinheritance very well. When she realized that the paperwork had already been put in and the law was irrefutably on our side, with even her own father dispassionately rebuking her and denying her claim, Thalia became a screaming wreck reduced to making hoarse vows of bloody vengeance against her sister for what she had done to her.

Such a charming girl. I hope she learned to conserve her stamina. When it came to ruining her life, we were only getting started.

By far, the most satisfying confrontation was with my supposed brother, Patrick. He sat wordlessly throughout the meeting we’d arranged, as our estate councilors explained the new family paradigm to him and his maddened fiancé. He also made it a point to ignore my presence, even though he couldn’t have been surprised to learn I was still alive, since Lord Velas made certain to share information with him. That was why I was surprised after things had concluded, when he pulled me aside for a little tête-à-tête.

It seemed he had some things he wanted to say to me.

“I should have fucking killed you the moment our mother dragged you into our house,” said the righteous holy knight who wished to ascend to the rank of paladin. “I should have slit your throat with a dull blade.”

“Has anyone ever suggested that you have issues with aggression?” I asked him.

A vein throbbed visibly in the corner of Patrick’s head before he responded.

“You stole my future, you little bastard. You even stole my girl. I just…I just don’t understand how you keep getting away with it. I just don’t get it. But I’ll fix it. Every single time you ever got in my way; I always made you pay for it. This time will be no different. I promise you.”

*“Patrick*, you should be more careful,” I said in a concerned tone of voice. “We share a bond of blood so I’m willing to overlook it but think of what others might say if they heard a minor noble like yourself threatening me. As the legal head of a great house, Lady Anikka might be forced to make an example of you.”

*“Kyler Velas,”* he said in disgust.

“What can I say? That’s now my legal name,” I shrugged.

Rachel had insisted upon it. Probably as revenge for me teasing her too often.

I’d resisted at first. Stragos had been my true name for fourteen centuries and casting it aside had felt like pulling out one of my own teeth by hand.

But as I thought about it, I realized that sort of thinking was in its own way, arbitrary nonsense. Why should I be so attached to it? It was a name associated with ruin and death. Why should I continue bearing it now that I’d been granted a second chance?

Kyler Stragos and Kyler Evans were both dead. Stragos had been a fiend who brought unnecessary suffering to millions. Although he had the potential to change for the better, he had never been brave enough to seize that opportunity. Tragic, yes, but his loss was still a benefit to his world.

Evans on the other hand, had been a good man without the resources needed to change his circumstances. He hadn’t lacked courage, but that still hadn’t been enough to make the world acknowledge him as a person. Without the power to fight his oppressors, he had amounted to nothing.

What if Kyler Velas could be a bridge between these two disparate individuals? Someone with Stragos’ power who also bore Evans’ defiant will. What manner of being might such a man become?

Could he become someone worthy of remembrance?

There was only one way to find out.

“Watch your back, *brother,”* Patrick said with spiteful intensity before turning his back on me. “A rising tide eventually crests on the shore. Just remember that when I come to take back what’s mine.”

“The wave may crest but it still washes the shore clean,” I said in reply.

Patrick paused to throw a final glare at me before leaving the room with a window shaking slam of the door.

Heh. *Drama.*

*\_\_*

Later, for the first time in a long while, I managed to escape the company of Rachel and Schultz long enough to enjoy a nap by myself.

It was a rare and refreshing experience to sleep by myself. But I was mistaken to believe that I’d get to enjoy it alone. Before much time had passed, a familiar presence soon joined me.

The dream shaped itself into a fine spring evening at an outdoor café I once frequented in London. Beside me, of all the people it could have been, sat Jamie, wearing a sleeveless white dress and enjoying a sip of coffee. I was so surprised by her presence that it took me a moment to realize that her voice sounded different.

“I’m sorry it took so long to get back to you,” she said sheepishly. “But can I say how pleased I am at how well you’ve taken to life in this world? I should have known you’d be up to the challenge.”

“Alpha?” I asked after realizing who was speaking to me.

“In the flesh!” she replied. “Well, in the dream anyway. I thought it would be fun to appear to you in the form of someone you cared for, so here I am! I like this a lot better than the disembodied voice routine.”

“Wow. Do I really still care for Jamie?” I asked in surprise. “I feel that our relationship became a bit *complicated* towards the end. The waters were truly muddied.”

I then sat silently for a few moments while I considered my own feelings. Then I said, “She turned out to be quite the vixen, didn’t she?”

“She was! I was *so* glad when you figured her out,” Alpha said with a smile. “But to answer your question, yes, you still subconsciously long for her.”

“She was such a horrible person, though,” I said.

“Emotions can be hopelessly complex,” Alpha said. “And people can wear many masks throughout their lifetimes. If it helps you feel better, there was a part of Jamie that truly cared for you as well. So here I am, representing that portion of her psyche for you. The genuine friendship hidden beneath her greed and subterfuge.”

“Heh,” I chuckled. “That’s very kind of you, Alpha.”

“Think nothing of it,” she said. “So, how have things been?”

“Don’t you already know everything?” I asked her teasingly. “Aren’t you the great eye in the sky?”

“I do have all the pertinent details,” she admitted. “But I only know them as plain facts without all the interesting nuance involved. I’d very much like to hear the entire tale from *your* exciting perspective. You’ve been having quite a few adventures of late, haven’t you, Lord Velas?”

“I have, haven’t I?” I grinned. “Where would you like me to start?”

1ggm2ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1ggm2ya/hugely_disappointed_with_dannam_enchanted_vietnam/,Hugely disappointed with d'Annam Enchanted Vietnam perfumes ,"I recently saw an ad for d'Annam white rice perfume and I got super excited. I adore rice notes and this one also had pandan, a note which I discovered in Vietnam and is so rarely used though it's SO GOOD! So I had a look at their other perfumes and they all looked pretty interesting. I've never bought a perfume without smelling it before however they had a sample set for purchase and I was so tempted by the description I went for it. Before I pressed Buy Now, I looked around online for general reviews and saw that white rice is seemingly super popular.  
They arrived today and disappointed is an understatement. These are not hugely expensive perfumes but at €110 a bottle, I was expecting higher quality.

**White rice** has a strong playdoh note right out the door with very faint rice. On my skin the pandan came through a bit more but was still marred by a popcorny playdohiness. I was majorly down on this.

**Monsoon tea** doesn’t have much of a tea note in my opinion and smells like citrus/agrume surface cleaner 

**In the garden** is basic sweet coconut jasmine 

**Harvest season** smells like the fruit top notes and thats it, no vetiver, patchouli, violet that is noted on the description

**Phu Quoc** I'm not a fan of aquatic perfumes, I avoid them in general and don’t know how to rate this one 

**Da Lat** seems the most interesting : juniper, red wine and a fresh rosiness - the wine and juniper give it some depth : After an hour it smells like nice juicy fruits 

**Through the forest** started out interesting with the blend of soft resin, incense, tobacco but dries down immediately to a simple light oud softened by sandalwood, it's not particularly special 

**Pho breakfast** straight up smells like bleach it’s repulsive 

**Vietnamese coffee** does what it says on the tin 

The perfumes seem to have top notes that disappear fast and have nothing else to them. I don't know what they're putting in their perfumes but I've never been so disappointed in a range. It's not that I just dislike them, I don't think they're well made.

1gglz1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1gglz1g/chronic_sinus_issue_dramatically_improved_with/,Chronic sinus issue dramatically improved with anti-histamine diet! ,"47 yr old female here. Since I got covid 1 year ago I have had chronic and somewhat debilitating sinus issues that never went away. I visited several doctors including 2 ENT's (who either gave steroids or recommended surgery) and several alternative care practitioners including 3 acupuncturists.

Steroids helped but I don't think it's ideal to be on them indefinitely and the symptoms came straight back when I stopped.

I was afraid that the surgery route wasn't addressing the root cause and possibly wouldn't work permanently so I wanted to try other methods.

I tried EVERYTHING to relieve my symptoms which would wake me up in the middle of the night and made for miserable mornings: blowing my nose and sneezing for several hours, brain fog, fatigue, etc. Humidifier, nasal rinse, steam, massage, hot compress, vocal exercise. I tried nasal probiotics and kimchi in case it was fungal (although I had a CAT Scan where that probably would have shown up). I tried a keto diet, Whole 30 and even did a 72 hour water fast. Nothing helped.

A couple weeks ago I stumbled on a thread about MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome) that can be caused by covid and it felt like it might be an answer for me. Although I don't have any other symptoms besides extremely swollen turbinates and stuffed up nose, it did seem like a possibility I had this. So I cut out my regular tea and coffee, avoided walnuts, eggs, banana and avocado which I was eating daily and took an antihistamine and the next morning to my surprise I woke up for the first time in a year without having to blow my nose! I had even had a glass of warm milk and honey the night before (I had avoided dairy for months).

I've been on this diet for a week and aside from a few hiccups (like drinking bone broth which I didn't realize was high histamine) I am feeling so much better. I'm still not 100% but I've been able to rest through the night without waking in horrible sinus pain and pressure and the mornings don't require 1 hour of blowing my nose before I'm human. In fact the mucus is like 10% of what it was.

• they stole an android screen we use for our coffee brewing system 
• they took a massive bag of frozen Southern fried chicken
• they stole a tray of frozen breakfast sausages
• they opened our fridge in the basement, left it open, went round the basement and then closed it again 
• they stole our last bottle of now discontinued Cafe Patron - this was perhaps the one that made us the saddest when we found out 
• they left some gloves behind (forensics came to collect them a day later) 
• they emptied our tip jar
• they also stole some teaspoons

Saturday 1am
• they break in again, this time they stay for 20 minutes 
• they stole a packet of cheese
• they put their hand in a newly replaced bag of Southern fried chicken, rummage in it and pull the chicken pieces out and leave them all over the freezer
 • they stole our laundry bag so they could put all the stuff in it
• they put a tea towel over their head to disguise their identity (this was picked up by forensics) 
• they emptied our tip jar again 
• they stole some cleaning products including bleach

1ggltes,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ggltes/3_year_relationship_32f_found_texts_on_my/,"3 year relationship, | (32F) found texts on my boyfriend (30M) phone. Cheating, Trust Violation or Both?","So let me start by saying up to this point I had full trust in my partner. We were in the middle of moving to a new place and I needed his phone to transter over some utilities that he already has the app for. When I was doing the 2 factor text authentication he got a message from someone saved in his contacts that I had never heard of before.

For context my boyfriend is a veteran and joined a veterans support group when he moved to the city we currently live in because he was active duty when he got here and doesn't know many people where we reside now. I thought it was a great idea and would get him out and about a few times a week.

I don't really ask much about it other than how it went, if he enjoys it etc. I know sometime stories are likely shared that are combat related and personal so I don't push to know what's discussed there.

My partner has met several people from this group and gone out with some of them and I've met a few people in passing. Apparently this woman is also in the group. I don't have an issue with him having friends of the opposing gender nor does he with me, but with that said I do have a problem with the content of the messages she was sending. Sending pictures of herself including one 1 picture showing her ass and saying she's sending them even though he’s not asking for it. I feel like the conversation should have been stopped right there. He said he started ghosting and not reply which based on the messages looks to be true… he didn’t respond until she kept texting over and over. My problem is I feel that if you’re in a relationship and someone is sending inappropriate messages or text that you know are not okay it’s time to stop talking to that person. He struggles with boundaries but him not setting limits there now has crossed a line for me.

He says that they go deep in the support group sometimes and multiple people including himself were concerned this person was going to hurt herself and they were all trying to be supportive. While I understand that and would never want someone to harm themselves it’s still not okay for her to be communicating with you like that and those messages have no bearing on her mental health so that’s no excuse for this.

Before those messages he had said they had gone out with some mutual friends once and grabbed coffee once after that. This all took place before the picture. Post that he hadn’t seen her again. My problem with this is I never heard of this person, he did tell me he was going out with his friend but didn’t mention this person by name. Given that I trusted him I also didn’t feel the need to ask. 

He says that he has never had feelings for this person, and never wanted any kind of relationship with her but admitted he felt like the group and himself would feel responsible if something happened to this person because they weren’t there and being supportive. When I found out he let me read all the messages, blocked her on everything, and said he’d stop going to the group. Which is great but he also didn’t mention this to me or do any of this until I found it… he could have done any of this before but you chose not to.

I feel like this is a large breach of trust, but my question is was this just extremely poor judgement or cheating or all of the above.

After I found out I told him I needed some time and space to think about this and went to stay with some close family members. I explained the situation to them and they think I might be overreacting. They say they can see how much my partner loves me and while they think it was poor judgement that led to a breach of trust they don’t see it as cheating because there’s no intent. So I am hoping for some feedback from others.",6,1730400272.0,relationship_advice,21,0.88,False

1gglra6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gglra6/i_probably_just_creeped_the_fuck_out_of_the_woman/,I probably just creeped the fuck out of the woman I like,"This is long, sorry. There's a TL;DR at the end.

So, this all happened last night, and I’m still processing the whole mess. I (40M) have really bad social anxiety, and I’m short—like 5'2—so confidence isn’t exactly my strong suit. I struggle to interact with others to the point where I haven't had any romantic relationships at this point, haven't even kissed a woman. I don't know how to flirt with someone or anything like that.  I usually keep to myself at work, mostly doing my job and avoiding much small talk. People don't talk to me either, they just ignore my existence unless they HAVE to interact with me, but there’s this woman, ""Lily"" (28F), who’s always been incredibly kind to me.

Lily is one of those genuinely warm people who seem to be nice to everyone. She remembers little things, asks how I’m doing, and actually seems to care about my answers. Over the past few months, we’ve had more little chats by the coffee machine, and she’d even make inside jokes with me. For someone who’s been pretty lonely, I started to look forward to those moments, probably way more than I should. I tried not to read into it too much, but I couldn’t help thinking that maybe, just maybe, she liked talking to me as much as I did to her. 

I just get so happy everytime I see her. She usually waves at me and says hi everyday (no one else has ever treated me this way) and initiates conversations with me. She's also kinda touchy - once, she say next to me during lunch and our shoulders were kinda touching. She didn't move away. Also, one time she kinda brushed her hand through my hair while talking to me. She has put her hand on my shoulder too and I still think of that everyday. She makes life worth living.

Recently, she invited me to a work outing. I was shocked—no one usually asks me to these things. I almost said no, but she seemed so enthusiastic that I convinced myself it was okay to step out of my comfort zone. So last night, I went.

At the bar, I felt like a fish out of water, so I decided to grab a drink to ease my nerves… then another… and another. I don’t drink much, so this was probably not my best idea. Lily noticed I was drinking a bit and started chatting with me, trying to include me in conversations, even pulling me out to the dance floor. I felt on top of the world - I couldn't believe that *I* of all people, was dancing with her. For once I felt like I belonged. Then, we got back to the bar and chatted more, while I got more drinks for her and myself. 

She laughed at something I said (I think it was ""first time I left my apartment for nonworking purposes"") and I took it as her laughing *at* me. So, I took a few shots of vodka. Then, it all went downhill. I remember giving her weird ass compliments like ""I love your beautiful collarbones"" and ""I could watch you type all day"". 

She was just awkwardly laughing at them. My drunk brain somehow thought that this meant she was into it. I tried to tell her that I liked her, but I said that she was good at ""humaning"" instead. Then, I leaned in and tried to kiss her, before falling off the chair and to the floor. I could barely get back up, but she helped me.

She said that I was too drunk, and promised to take me home. She called an uber, and it got more embarrassing. I got car sick and vomited during the ride, thankfully the driver managed to pull over in time. Lily was still being nice, she literally rubbed my back while I was puking my guts out and told me that It's all gonna be okay. She walked me up to my flat, hugged me goodbye and told me to take care.

Now it’s the morning after, and I feel like absolute garbage. I’m hungover and can barely even look at myself in the mirror. I think I got an alcohol poisoning, I keep vomiting water. 

She was just being kind, and I probably made her uncomfortable. She didn’t seem upset, but I can’t shake this horrible feeling that I crossed a line and creeped her out. She probably only talked to me because she thought that I was a lonely old man, and now she thinks that I'm a creepy lonely old man.

I don’t know what to do. Should I apologize? Try to act like it didn’t happen? Or is that just going to make things even more awkward? She’s one of the few people I actually like at work, and I’m terrified I just ruined everything.


TL;DR: Got way too drunk at a work outing because I thought it’d help me be less awkward around my crush, Lily (28F). Ended up giving her bizarre compliments, tried to kiss her, fell off my chair, and then threw up in front of her on the way home. She still helped me get back to my place and hugged me goodbye. Now I’m hungover, embarrassed, and worried I creeped her out and ruined everything.",2,1730400113.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.75,False

1gglozj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gglozj/when_does_it_end/,When does it end,"When can my heart be my own again? I tried recently to go on a date, I tried my best and saw this nice man twice. But all I could do was compare him to you, every little thing said and every physical attribute, mannerisms, etc. then I realized quickly I only went out with him because he has eyes like yours, kind, big, brown beautiful eyes. The ones I used to be so scared of looking into for fear of not being chosen, a fear that I manifested into being. 

I realized then that I was trying to imitate you, us, my dreams. That all I still want is you. I thought I laid you to rest within my heart, I knew no matter what I still love you and may forever love and desire you to be mine, for you to father my children and just be here with me. But I thought I healthily acknowledged that and accepted that part of myself so that maybe I could try again.

I can’t, he was so nice but he was and is not you. Maybe I just need more time. The amount of time that has passed of you not wanting me or being here for me makes me feel pathetic for I have dreams to live out, a family to start, I want to be experienced and experience another in love, joy, and excitement. I just felt… disappointed. 

I tried. But I’d prefer still to be alone if your eyes aren’t the ones I’m looking into, if your voice is not the one I hear, if your chest is not the one I would get to lay on and be caressed in such a way that made the whole world just melt away. 

It’s so funny to think I made you ever feel like I didn’t love you, through faults of my own, through selfish wants of being your one and only and I drove you away. I love you so much. 

I cry sometimes still when I’m alone and speak to you as if you’re here, and can hear me. But when you only watch me from afar and say nothing I don’t know what to think. It comforts me at first to think you can hear me but then if you could hear my cries and pleas, then not reach out then that hurts me even more. 

I’m going to stop that cycle it isn’t good for me. I just love you so much and miss you. It almost feels my dreams I want to live are impossible without you. But I guess like they say, this too shall pass. It may take me years but if it does or if I die alone without a lover at least I can say I had met the love of my life and I know who he is and what his eyes look like, what his soul looks like. 

I just hope you are happy and fulfilled,
I hope you have everything you’ve ever wanted and your life is amazing, even if I am not in it like every fiber of my being wants to be.

It feels I’ve let go of you a thousand times now to only turn around and see you laying next to me when I wake up in the middle of the night. A glimpse, a hope, sometimes I even play into the delusion and my imagination and feel you holding me. 

Isn’t this just silly haha. I will figure it out one way or another, I always do. For now I accept that all I still want is you by my side. Maybe one day it’ll pass and I can start again and I hope I can love another as I love you, but part of me fears that you were it for me and I let you slip through my fingers. 

Oh well, time for another cup of coffee.

She's the one calling it quits, so I regret not having the courage to do it first. But I'm still celebrating.

I know everything I'm about to say is going to look like a ""nice guy"" red flag, but if you get to know me, I think you'll learn I'm telling the truth here. We had a really big freeze and power outage here a few years back. Power was out in our home, and it was below freezing in our house. She talked about how she needed to pee but was scared about how cold the toilet seat was going to be. So, I went in the bathroom for her and sat to warm it up. And I would constantly go up to bed before her, even before the freeze, to warm up her side of the bed.

Constant foot rubs. She's a runner. I figured she needed it and deserved it. She never even had to ask. I ALWAYS initiated. On our first date, she cancelled because she was sick. I called and asked if she wanted me to drop off soup for her. That ended up becoming our first date -- soup at her coffee table -- despite her runny nose. After her grandmother died and we were on a vacation, I noticed her lighting a candle at a church for her, despite not being a believer. So, I created a new tradition where we would light a candle for her at a church in every place we visited. So her grandmother could ""go on vacation"" with us. She always loved travelling.

I spent hours secretly learning some Spanish just so I could surprise her and be able talk to her family and speak to her in her native tongue. When her dog died (the first dog she had ever had), I found a poem to commemorate it that touched her so deeply that she got it tattooed on her arm.

What I'm trying to say is that I put in the fucking effort. The above is just the start of.

But she couldn't even tell me I did a good job when I spoke at my own grandmother's funeral. She was the ONLY one there who didn't tell me I did a good job. She laughed at me when I had to euthanize (and not in a good way) our niece's pet chicken after our dog had attacked it. I was torn to pieces. She didn't give a shit. She's yelled at me for being sick or injured, blaming me for it. She used to tell me that she loved me because I was the only person who never yelled at her. And it is true that I never raised my voice to her. I only made her cry twice and I still would beat myself up for that YEARS later. But yelling? She's yelled at me for putting the vegetable peeler in the wrong draw far more than I've EVER yelled at her for ANYTHING.

My closest friends are gone now because she drove them away with her temper. And that's not speculation. They told me. She quit her last job on the spot when they said they wanted her to take an anger management course. She's tried alienating me from my family.

The ONLY social network I still had left were her (abusive), my family (whom she tries to alienate me from) and my last remaining close friend (whom she openly flirts with in front of me). Luckily the latter still has my back. And my family has welcomed me to visit for the weekend.

I'm seething right now. But I'm so glad she finally pulled the plug. We'll be done soon. I'll have so many more stories to share to get it all out.",2,1730399712.0,abusiverelationships,3,1.0,False

Every night, our neighbors go for a swim in the freezing ocean.","My wife and I recently moved to a beach house located on the rugged Pacific Northwest coastline. The cottage with yellow shutters opened out onto sand dunes leading to the ocean. We were surrounded by neighboring cottages each with the same yellow shutters. I worked remotely, and my wife was a painter. We felt it was time to leave the city and live in a quiet small town community. A place where we could reflect and appreciate our surroundings.

We went on our first early morning dog walk with Barry along the oceanfront. It was a misty morning, and the waves lapped up onto the beach. It was perfect, a far cry from dog walks in small parks. We passed several dog walkers weaving in and out of the surf. I noticed that they were all barefoot. I slipped off my shoes and socks. I craved to feel the sand beneath my feet. I instantly felt the cold from the wet sand. A wave brushed over my feet. I grimaced. The water was freezing.

Alice looked at me. ""Are you okay?"" I faked a smile. ""Just a bit chilly.""

We continued walking along the shoreline and passed several more barefoot dog walkers. My legs were numb, but I was too embarrassed to let on. I thought to myself, how are they able to withstand the cold?

My wife looked at me again. ""Are you sure you're okay?"" The pain was now unbearable. ""Shall we explore the town?"" I quickly replied.

With my shoes and socks back on, we strolled through the small coastal town. There was a small bait shop and a hardware store, but not much else. My legs were still numb, and I needed to warm up. ""Shall we get something to drink?"" I suggested. ""Where?"" Alice replied.

We walked around for a while looking for a coffee shop but couldn't find one. We passed a middle-aged couple sitting on a bench gazing out at the ocean. 

I stopped and smiled. ""Excuse me, is there a coffee shop nearby?"" They continued to gaze out at the ocean. It was like they were in a trance. ""We've just moved here,"" I added.

Their eyes lit up. The lady pointed to a nearby street. ""Helen's tea room is right around the corner."" ""Thank you,"" I replied. The gentleman chuckled. ""That'll warm your legs up."" I was taken aback by his response. How did he know my legs felt like icicles?

We entered a quaint tea room decorated with nineteenth-century antique furniture. The place was packed with locals sitting together and drinking tea. They stopped talking and stared at us. My wife and I exchanged a look. ""We must look like tourists,"" I quipped.

A mysterious lady in her late seventies wearing a robe greeted us. My wife nervously smiled. ""You have a charming little place."" Helen frowned. ""Sorry, we are fully booked.""

I scanned the room and noticed an empty table in the corner. ""We've just moved here,"" I said. She stared at me. ""One of the cottages along the beach with the yellow shutters."" Helen's eyes lit up. ""Please come this way. Let's warm up those legs.""

Helen poured us a steaming cup of yellowish tea. ""Our special blend,"" she told us. ""Do you get many tourists here?"" Alice asked. ""They leave once it's too cold to swim,"" she replied. Helen left and poured the yellowish tea to another couple.

My wife and I looked at each other and took a sip. The locals watched. The warmth of the tea radiated through my body. I felt a tingling sensation in my legs. The numbness melted away.

Later that evening, I took a lukewarm shower and joined Alice in bed. She was asleep on top of the sheets. I opened the bedroom window slightly to let in the cool ocean breeze. It wasn't a hot night, but it felt humid.

Tossing and turning, I woke up to Barry's loud barking. I looked at my cell phone. It was two am. Barry continued to bark louder and louder. I entered the living room and switched on the lights. Barry was jumping up at the window, barking at something outside.

I tentatively went outside and picked up a beach stone. My heart was pounding through my chest. What if it was an intruder? Anyone could easily access our property via the beach. I saw a light coming from my neighbor's porch. To my surprise, my neighbor was rinsing off in his outdoor shower. I put down the stone and walked over. My neighbor, who was in his early forties, gym fit, wrapped a towel around his waist. He smiled and extended out his hand.

""I'm Jim. You must be our new neighbors."" I stared at him in disbelief. ""Jim, it's two am?"" He casually replied, ""Lovely evening for a dip.""

Surely, he didn't mean the ocean. It's like fifty degrees. You would get hypothermia.

Jim kept smiling. ""You're welcome to join us one night.""

I just stood there. He turned and went back into his beach house. A patch of salt water on his shoulder absorbed into his yellowish skin.

I struggled to go back to sleep. It was too hot, and my mind was racing. Did our crazy neighbor really invite us for a dip in the ocean?  

I woke up the next morning drenched in sweat. I wearily entered the living room and saw Alice outside on the deck in her nightgown, painting the ocean. I joined her. ""How long have you been up?"" I asked. ""I couldn't sleep. It was too muggy,"" she replied.

She began to paint a yellowish figure swimming in the ocean. I stared at the yellow figure.

""That's funny you should paint that. I spoke to our neighbor last night. He'd just got back from his nightly swim in the ocean.""

Alice looked up. ""Some people go Arctic swimming.""

Of course, Alice was right. But the whole encounter still seemed odd.

All day, I couldn't stop thinking about my strange interaction with the neighbor. He seemed so relaxed. Why wasn't he shivering? Why was his skin the same yellowish color as in my wife's painting?

That evening, I waited up. I had to see with my own eyes if my neighbor went for a swim in the ocean. I was getting tired and nodded off in my deck chair. I awoke to voices coming from the ocean.

I crept down to the shoreline. It was pitch black except for a yellowish glow shining off the water. To my utter shock, my neighbors were swimming and bathing in the freezing ocean. Some were diving under the water while others floated on their backs. I crouched behind a sand dune, trying to stay hidden. Jim stood up in the water, and I caught his eye. He smiled and waved for me to join them. I ran as fast as I could back to my beach house. I could hear them splashing in the waves from behind.

I locked the doors and closed the shutters. I was sweating profusely. I thought to myself, this is insane. There is no way I could join them. I wouldn't survive.  

As the weeks passed, we became more settled in. We went on long beach walks with Barry and paddled our feet in the waves. There were still a few tourists around. I remembered thinking, will they ever leave us in peace? We regularly stopped off at Helen's tea room and even bought our own supply of yellow tea.

Every night, my wife and I went down to the shore and watched the neighbors enjoying their nightly swim. I was no longer afraid of the freezing ocean, but despite welcoming smiles from our neighbors, I still wasn't ready to venture in.

One dark winter evening, I joined my wife for a cold shower. The water felt warm on our skin. After we got out of the shower, we were dry almost immediately. I looked in the mirror and saw a yellowish glow radiate through our naked bodies. That night, we couldn't sleep. We were burning up, and our skin was red hot to the touch. Alice and I looked at each other and knew exactly what we needed to do.

In our swimwear, we walked hand in hand through the sand dunes and joined our neighbors in the ocean. Our neighbors smiled at us and carried on swimming. As I submerged into the ocean, the freezing water soothed my flaming skin. I bathed and splashed around. I was in a state of euphoria.  

Over the next several nights, we joined our neighbors in the ocean. It was the highlight of my day. The thought of the ice-cold water hitting my skin and the feeling of truly belonging was intoxicating. It consumed my every waking moment.

One evening, as we prepared for our nightly swim by taking an ice bath and drinking the yellow tea on the deck, we saw a group of young travelers on the beach, sitting around a campfire. My wife and I frowned. How dare they spoil our perfect evening.

As we walked down to the shore, an argument erupted between our neighbors and the travelers. There was lots of swearing back and forth. The neighbors engulfed the travelers and to my shock, dragged them into the ocean. The travelers were screaming and thrashing about as they were held under the freezing water. I ran into the ocean, but it was too late. Everything went silent. The travelers were floating face-down. I desperately tried to pull their lifeless bodies back to the shore, but the tide was too strong. The neighbors bathed and swam like nothing ever happened.

Back at our beach house, my wife and I were panicking. ""We need to call the cops,"" Alice cried. ""It would be our word against the neighbors,"" I exclaimed.

There's no way the cops would believe our nightly swims and our resistance to the freezing ocean. It would be ruled a tragic accident involving drunk tourists.

The next morning, we woke up on the bathroom tiles. We couldn't sleep as we were burning up and needed to take turns going in and out of the shower. I went outside to get some fresh air and saw Jim setting off for his morning run. He smiled at me. How can he possibly smile? Does he even realize that he murdered innocent people last night?

My wife and I decided to clear our heads and take Barry on a long walk. I couldn't help but look at the majestic scenery. The jagged cliffs and the waves crashing against the boulders. There was a brief moment where I forgot about last night. As we walked back, we passed a young family with a five-year-old little girl.

The mother politely asked, ""Is there anywhere that sells ice cream?"" ""It's not summer!"" I abruptly answered.

The mother and father exchanged a look and continued on. Their daughter looked upset. It then dawned on me that I was becoming like my neighbors and that they were in danger. I quickly caught up to them.

""You need to leave!"" The family hurried away from me. I shouted out, ""It's not safe for tourists!""

That evening, we decided to not go for our nightly swim. How could we after what we witnessed? We stayed in our ice bath, but the temperature kept rising, and the water started to boil. We were getting cooked alive and had no choice but to go into the ocean.

""One little swim,"" I said.

We quickly headed down to the shore and entered the ocean. We avoided our neighbors who swam and bathed in what might as well have been the traveler's blood. My wife and I swam for our lives, desperately trying to get the heat off us.

Eventually, we cooled down and swam back to the shore, where we heard a muffled cry. Our neighbors were dragging the young family kicking and screaming from a nearby beach house they were renting.

The neighbors savagely submerged the mother and father. I swam over as fast as I could and tried to fight them off, but they held me back. They were too possessed, their eyes bright yellow.

The little girl was left struggling to stay afloat, her arms and legs no longer able to move in the freezing water. The mother and father stopped fighting and went limp.

With her last gasp, the mother cried out to me, ""Save her!""

The little girl was taken under by a large wave. I dived deep into the water and saw her lifeless body sinking to the seabed. I grabbed her arm and pulled her to the shore. My wife and I carried the unconscious little girl to our beach house. In the background, the neighbors continued to bathe and swim with smiles on their faces.

Back at the beach house, we laid the little girl down on the couch. She had gone blue and was hyperventilating. I wrapped her up in sheets, but she was still unresponsive.

""We need to call 911!"" Alice cried. ""There's no time!"" I replied.

I looked over to the pot of tea on the kitchen counter. I gently poured the tea down her throat. A yellow glow passed through her veins. We waited with bated breath. Her eyes flashed open.

Even after witnessing our neighbor's ritual killings, we could never leave the beach house. We needed our nightly swims to survive. The little girl became our daughter. She was too young to remember what happened, and now that she's older, she even goes swimming in the ocean with her friends.

Every day, my wife and I walk Barry along the oceanfront, and if we see a tourist, we warn them to leave.",4,1730399308.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1ggl9ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ggl9ma/what_did_your_nparents_argumented_into_a_bad/,What did your Nparents argumented into a bad thing because they did not like it/want it?,"So my Ndad who I have had the pleasure to grow up with never took me and my mom out to eat somewhere nice for dinner. He said it was only something for people ""who could not cook or did have too much money"".

That's why the first time that I got a meal from Mcdonalds was when we went there with my kindergarten group. I was so happy on that day, I was overwhelmed!  This ban of going to restaurants/cafés would later result in guilty feelings everytime I would go out sometimes for a meal/coffee when I was older. 

Another thing that my dad did not want to spend any money on was for going on vaction. When I asked him why we would never travel somewhere (because all my friends did with their parents) he said that travelling is a thing for people without any hobbies or only a good thing for old people who did not have to work anymore and therefore have enough time to travel. 

So he invented all these arguments against restaurants or travelling simply because he did not want to do it himself and did not want to spend any money on it. Meanwhile he spended an excessive amount of our family money for his hobby: music. He would buy expensive guitars, guitar amplifiers (he was not a professional musician), vinyls, Cds etc. 

My mom did not have her own bank account at that time and remembered how she would rush to the bank at the beginning of the month to take in some cash for our food. Otherwise we would not have enough, because he would spend it for his hobbies. 

So what were the normal & nice things that your Nparents would not give to you as a child only because they did not want to spend money on it? 

And what kind of ridiculous arguments against those things did they come up with?

When I'm in a good mood, I share whatever I have like mints, notes, memes until people i dont even know come sliding in my dms for notes even though majority of them in the gc, especially if they are polite or got valid reasons they cmi to lect ah, like I help 1 times I still okay one ah but unless u tell me u skip 3 lessons in a row, then all I get is a okayyy thankuuuu\~\~\~\~ and zao like at least strike up convo, or exchange notes or buy me a coffee for lecture ah.

Same goes to juniors who slide into my dms when they want something cos Im like their big sis to them (lowkey established at the start be like oh u can ask me about anything one ahh), got this jr right, she dont even know my name and face (considering my tele name and pfp is not my face n name, more like emoji ah), like it gives me the ick where the asker is giving kiasu vibes like say same day after finished finals ask me for next sem notes like hello, u no need rest one ah? I mean I already shared whatever jr needed from a previous convo, just she needed extra stuff, and I felt the more I yap and share about progressing in course and intern ah, its just ""okayyy thank youuuuuuuu"", gonez.

Wah the other day same jr asked me for help again basically she said that she cmi attendance rate and prob gg fail/remod 1 credit mod. I (after abit of hesitation to answer her) just said take MC ah, it helps ah, like at least an attempt. She be like will it help??? and Im like worth a shot, just $8 from polyclinic. She ask me if i know any other tele med other than ManaDr ah and I said idk, i always go polyclinic one. and shes like orh ok. A while (as in few hours later) saw a very similar qn on our sch subreddit, people got answer ofc ah, but its 1 CU not like 4 CU which can tank your entire GPA one. I mean the concept of this 1 CU mod is still new to me and im not entirely sure on the remodding part or remod affect gpa, considering I never remod b4, like its just 1 CU, more impt things to worry about ah.

I just wish this junior or people idk who ask me for help like at least be like ""eh hows life?"" or like ""eh u coming back to sch to eat or not?"" She doesnt even know my actual name and comes when she needs something,  not just gonez ah, I mean i got check up on her at times on hows sch ah or how she coping ah. I have nothing to benefit from her, like i feel im the giving tree literally.  I mean if I were in her shoes, i go to whoevers closest for help from a senior or a cher like me ah, but I feel like she using me as a personal helpdesk ah.  
  
For those like be like aiya just block her ah or bluetick, i just dont have the heart to ah, I usually reply or acknowledge the message (when i nothing to respond w) and not people hanging ah but idk maybe in future sekali my jr become my boss even though im older than her, anyway at least im semi-anon in a way. thinking about I just be like DONATELLA VERSACE 💜 to literally whatever she asks regarding about sch or be like a lawyer and charge $1000 for like every 3 legal advice qns, but just $10 paynow code ah , maybe she will get the message, but i legit dont want to tear a bridge down (but what is a bridge without its foundation on the other side)",2,1730398514.0,SGExams,1,1.0,False

1ggl1s6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggl1s6,Loblaws Insiders Decoded Please," Yes, grocery chains and retailers in general deliberately avoid round numbers in their pricing for several psychological and business reasons:

1. Psychological Pricing (also known as ""charm pricing""):
- Prices ending in .99 or .97 create an illusion that the item is cheaper than it actually is
- A $7.99 item is perceived as being in the $7 range rather than almost $8
- This is known as the ""left-digit effect"" where consumers put more emphasis on the first number they read

2. Loss Leader Indicators:
- Different cent endings can indicate different things to store staff and savvy shoppers
- For example (though this varies by retailer):
  - .99 might indicate a regular price
  - .97 might indicate a clearance item
  - .94 might indicate a manager's special
  - .00 endings are often avoided because they can suggest arbitrary pricing rather than carefully calculated margins

3. Precise Margin Calculations:
- Grocery stores typically work with very thin profit margins
- Using odd numbers allows them to capture every possible cent of margin
- When dealing with high-volume sales, even a few cents difference per item can significantly impact overall profitability

4. Price Change Tracking:
- Non-round numbers make it easier to track when prices have been changed
- They can indicate which pricing strategy or promotion is in effect
- This helps with inventory management and sales analysis

In the Canadian market specifically, since we eliminated the penny, most prices end up being rounded at the cash register, but the psychological impact of the non-round shelf prices remains effective.",9,1730398307.0,loblawsisoutofcontrol,18,0.76,False
