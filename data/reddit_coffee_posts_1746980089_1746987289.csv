35 male from South Bay Area , Seperated looking to start dating again. Have kids, but not full time. Looking for a normal mature woman for a little physical and emotional connection.

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often. I’m weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don’t have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine. I am a sucker for super pretty faces. Any height is fine including taller.

I’m a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I’m a man’s man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it’s cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there’s a connection, meet for coffee. 

Let me know more about you!

The urban legends about the airport are lies, the truth is so much worse","I only made it out of the coffee shop I was in for my last post by the skin of my teeth, but I'm back again to tell a bit more of the story. I made it to a hotel in a place I won't mention, so I'm hopeful I can get through a bit more in this update, but, we'll see.

After my dad got lost at the airport, at first I didn't want to believe that anything had happened to him. Other than the menacing glare, he seemed normal. The drive home with my dad was mostly uneventful, he didn't say anything unusual, and everything seemed altogether normal. I started to doubt if he had even given me a menacing look, he is not as young as he used to be, maybe he just suddenly had an ache in his back with all the hugs? Anyways, everything seemed normal, and even happy. 

Something about him almost going missing scared my sister so much that she decided to extend her vacation a bit, and suggested we all head up into the mountains together for some hiking. As children our parents used to take us on hiking outings pretty regularly, but we hadn't been as a family in years. We picked some good hikes, made some reservations at a hotel adjacent to a hot springs we had enjoyed years ago, and I requested time off from work which was surprisingly granted. Everything seemed to be going up and up.

Until the second night in our hotel.

We had just done the first big hike of the trip, a segment of the continental divide trail, and had a hearty dinner in town before turning in for the night. My parents shared a large room, and my sister and I each had our own smaller single rooms. It was motel style, but it didn't feel rundown at all. I had been in bed for almost an hour already, but was only just at the edge of sleep having horrible chronic insomnia. I was just finally starting to feel myself drift off when I heard a rustling at my door. I froze, unsure what I should do.

I was just considering getting up when the rustling stopped, only to be replaced by the slow creaking of the door as it was opened very slowly. I should have leapt up, but it felt like there was an elephant on my chest, and something in my mind screamed at me to stay still, so I didn't move and kept my eyes clamped shut. I heard someone walk quietly over the carpet towards my bed.

There was the sound of heavy breathing above me, and I could feel the wet stickiness of the person's breath hit my face. I tried to breath naturally, but had to choke down a cough from the odd smell coming from them. I don't know how long I laid there tensely trying to keep up the charade.

Finally, the person spoke with my father's voice. ""I know you know. I don't care. There's nothing you can do, your father's gone. It's only me now. If you are good, maybe I'll save you for last, maybe I'll get your sister first.""

His breath as he spoke smelled even more strongly of the strange scent that I suddenly recognized as the smell of rot. I remained frozen, fighting my urge to retch or grab him and demand he leave my sister alone.

After what felt like an eternity, I heard his footsteps moving back towards the door. ""Yeah. I think I'll start with her. Sweet dreams.""

I heard the door close. I waited a few minutes, desperately willing my body to respond. Finally I was able to muster the courage to sit up, though it felt like my muscles were still fighting against me. For a few minutes I just rocked in place, unsure what I should do. Should I try to tell my sister and mother? Should I just not let my sister be alone with him? I couldn't do that forever, what about when she finally went back to work in San Francisco? Could this thing masquerading as my father get her there?

The next day we started with another hike, this time to a nearby peak. It was a hard push, with a little scrambling and a great deal of wind at the peak, but we made it. Throughout the hike I tried to make sure I was never out of sight of my sister, and as much as possible I stayed right next to her. I watched the thing that had replaced my dad, but throughout the whole hike he didn't behave suspiciously other than looking confused at me when I'd refuse to leave my sister even to take pictures at the high point. I had to give it to him, he was playing the role perfectly.

After the hike, we all opted to hit the hot springs adjacent to our hotel. My mom and sister decided to head to the thermal caves, leaving the thing that replaced my dad and I stuck in the pool since the caves were gender segregated. While not happy to be stuck alone with the replacement, I was deeply relieved that my sister would be safe.

""Well son - where do you wanna go? Want to hit the thermal caves?""

I thought for a moment, thinking maybe that would be nice, even with this replacement, before realizing that would make it more likely we'd find ourselves in an isolated place, something I wanted to avoid at all costs.

""Nah dad, how about we go to the hot springs swimming pool? I'd like a little more room to play in the water, and it's a bit more comfortable.""

He laughed, ""Whatever you say son, I just want to get my muscles nice and soft after that hike.""

Despite the company, the pool was nice. I got to soak and managed to mostly avoid talking to that thing while I let my muscles relax from the hike. After a while I got out of the pool and rested in one of the chairs to avoid overheating and to think. I wasn't sure what I'd do that night, because then my sister would finally be alone in her room and I wasn't sure that I could finnagle a way to be there with her the whole night.

My brainstorming was interrupted by a cry from the thing that had replaced my dad. He had moved into the deep end of the pool, and it seemed like his muscles had cramped badly, and he was struggling to swim. He was trying to scream for me to help him, but his face was so far under water that he couldn't manage. I ran to the side of the pool he was trying to get to, and readied myself to jump in.

Then it hit me. This was the solution to my problem. This thing had replaced and probably killed my dad - he had already said my dad was gone - and threatened my sister. If he died, all my worries would be over. I gulped hard, still not sure what to do, but I just sat, watching. I saw the thing wearing my dad's face look terrified, and a sense of shame washed over me. I wanted to help, so badly, my soul screamed for me to just jump in, but I knew the only chance my sister would have is if I didn't.

It took a few minutes, but, eventually I saw him stop moving beneath the water. I stared in shock, unable to think straight. Finally I realized I needed to call someone. I ran to the emergency phone at the pool entrance and called the lobby.

The rest of the day went by in a haze. There was an ambulance, a declaration that the thing that replaced my dad was not dead, but in a coma, lots of crying by all of us - them for the thing in a coma, me for my dad who I knew was already dead. After the hospital we decided to stay back at the hotels for now, to remain close to the hospital. The doctors said that they would decide what to do in the next few days - either he'd wake up, or they'd relocate him to Denver.

Falling asleep that night, I felt grief for my father, but relief that the thing stealing his body was in a coma and that my sister would be safe. I managed to fall asleep in only a half hour, the easiest sleep I'd had in years.

I woke up startled by the door opening again. I kept my eyes shut again, not sure what was happening, but knowing it would be safer if I just played asleep. I heard and felt someone breathing over me again. The smell was that same smell of rot that had come from the thing that replaced my father, but with a faint tinge of a sweet orange scent.

When they finally spoke, they uttered only a single phrase, a phrase that haunts me to this day.

""Too late,"" the thing that replaced my sister said.

Alright, I should probably leave things there for now. I promise I'll post again and finish catching you all up, but I need to spend some time today planning my next move.

1kk77ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kk77ad/does_ge_fxhsc_water_filter_really_deliver_clean/,Does GE FXHSC Water Filter Really Deliver Clean Water? Detailed Review Inside!,"**A Comprehensive Look at the GE FXHSC Whole House Water Filter**

The GE FXHSC Whole House Water Filter is a remarkable addition to any home in need of reliable water filtration. I’ve had the opportunity to incorporate it into my daily life, and if there’s one thing I can say right off the bat, it’s that this filter makes a noticeable difference. Designed to bring cleaner water to every tap in your home, its performance is difficult to overlook. With features like NSF certification and its ability to remove sediment, rust, and other impurities, this filter cleverly balances function and affordability. GE managed to tick a lot of the right boxes here.  

**Thoughtful Design Brings It All Together**

This water filter is sturdy without being cumbersome, measuring 4.5 inches in diameter and 10 inches in height. Its universal compatibility with most 10-inch whole-house, high-flow filtration systems simplifies the replacement process. I particularly liked its no-nonsense design in crisp white—functional yet unobtrusive. The build quality feels reliable as it’s made from carbon fiber, which adds durability while aiding filtration efficiency. These thoughtful design elements make it compatible with systems like the GXWH40L, GXWH30C, and similar models, saving me the headache of hunting down compatible filters.  

[Check GE FXHSC price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0ccymb692/)  

**An Admirable Performance in Filtration**

Using this filter, the difference in water quality was felt almost immediately. The water used to leave odd residue in the sink and the showerhead would often clog with sediment build-up. After replacing my filter with this one, the changes were obvious. The GE FXHSC’s high capacity to reduce rust, sand, and sediment ensures cleaner water and extends the life of appliances like coffee makers and dishwashers. It improves plumbing efficiency, too, safeguarding it from debris-filled water.  

An added bonus was how it noticeably minimized chlorine taste and odor in our water, which significantly improved it for drinking and cooking. While it isn’t designed to purify water in the strictest sense, the filter certainly delivers for general household needs.

**Positives**

- Excellent performance in reducing sediment, sand, and rust.  
- Certified by NSF, giving extra confidence in its quality.  
- Long three-month lifespan for reduced maintenance effort.  
- Broad compatibility with many popular whole-house filtration systems.  

**Challenges in Real-World Use**

Even with all its strengths, there are a couple of caveats to mention based on my experience and what some others have said online.  

**Pitfalls**  

- Installation can be a little tricky if you’re not already familiar with whole-house systems.  
- At times, it seems to reduce water pressure slightly, especially if nearing the end of its life.  

For my household, the slight dip in water flow wasn’t a massive drawback, but it’s worth mentioning, so you know what to expect. If you have a large family, keeping track of the filter’s life span may become important to avoid water pressure issues.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the GE FXHSC to its competitors, a few clear distinctions stand out. A major rival in this category is the 3M Aqua-Pure AP810 whole-house replacement filter. While the Aqua-Pure can handle higher water flow rates without pressure drops, it’s comparatively more expensive and isn’t as effective at filtering smaller particles like fine sediment. Another competitor, the Culligan R50-BBSA, boasts impressive sediment reduction but lacks the durability of the GE FXHSC, particularly for high-use households.

Where the GE FXHSC excels is in its balance of affordability, performance, and longevity. It doesn’t necessarily have the bells and whistles of premium offerings, but for most households, it hits the sweet spot of efficiency and practicality.  

**Price Performance**

When we talk about cost, I found the product to offer excellent price performance. Replacement filters can be an ongoing expense, but with the GE FXHSC, the three-month filter life translates to fewer replacements and better long-term value. It’s affordable compared to high-end alternatives while still doing a thorough job. For the features it delivers—certified sediment reduction, compatibility across multiple filter systems, and a sturdy build—it feels like smart spending. You’re not just throwing money at a name but investing in better water quality for your whole home.

1kk75nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kk75nu/i_feel_so_embarrassed/,I feel so embarrassed.,"I feel quite embarrassed by this. I'd like to get it off my chest and hopefully move on and never have to even think about this again.

A while ago, almost 5-6 weeks ago, I was at an event, a musical one. I ran into a lady there that was extremely beautiful. I am not the most introverted person in the world, but I don't find it easy to interact with people in public unless there's an 'in' -- Meaning if they're holding a book that I'm familiar with then I would feel comfortable to open a conversation about it, if they're wearing an item that resembled anything, etc. 

I did not actually step forward and talk to that lady, and I went home after the event ended and did not think much of it at all.

A couple of days later, I was following IG pages that related to the event (Organizers, etc) and her account popped up in the suggested list. I could not believe it. Her account was public and I thought to myself I HAVE to DM her. I spent a bit actually typing up a really cute message about how this is random and that it is a pure coincidence that I was recommended the account of the very gorgeous person I ran into the other day. Stuff along the lines of that, and by the end of the message I asked her if she'd like to go for coffee someday. I had no expectations. I thought to myself she probably receives a million of these messages every day. I was so surprised (and a bit ecstatic actually) when she responded a couple of hours later. She thought it was very cute and said yes! I could not believe that I got lucky! 

Anyways. It's been six weeks. We haven't actually gone out for coffee yet. I didn't want to seem too pushy, but whenever I'd text her she'd tell me she's busy this week. I'd wait a few more days and wait again. I'd try to maintain a friendly conversation, but I didn't want to delve into anything sophisticated or anything as I prefer to do it in person over text. I reflected about the whole situation this weekend and I'm thinking to myself how embarrassing. I feel quite ashamed. I'm being ignored. The conversations are being quite one sided. Why am I doing this to myself? Why did she agree if she's not actually interested? And why did I continue on trying after she said she was busy and that I needed to wait longer a couple of times?

Gosh. This is so lame. I wish I can go back in time and just undo this whole fucking mess. I spent years working on myself. Trying to improve mentally and become more stoic, and now I have reduced myself to someone who needs to constantly look at his phone and see if he's got a reply.

1kk75f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleK/comments/1kk75f6/burnt_out/,Burnt Out,"I’ve been doing third shift for about 8 months now and boy am I fucking tired of it. I’m scheduled 5 days a week while everyone else is scheduled 4. My days off are separated so I end up being in the store every single day regardless of what day I’m scheduled “off”. The other shifts, in my opinion, are lazy and not worth a damn. They are obviously not held to the same standard that I am. I come in every night to a filthy store; nothing is stocked or cleaned. Even where is “double coverage” it seems like less gets done. Why does less work get done the more workers there are? Not to mention the other night shift person wanting to micromanage what I’m doing on my shift. Leaving my notes to “work back-stock” As crazy as it sounds I have never once touched back stock. I do not have the time. By the time I have a chance to leave the register I have to clean the grill, wash dishes (having third shift do that is kind of ridiculous), clean and stock the coffee bar (surprise surprise second shift can’t do that either), stock the beer cooler, sweep and mop the floors, and then by the time all that is done I have to prepare breakfast. They’re also wanting me to audit cigarettes now? Apparently if I see an issue in the store I shouldn’t message my manager about it; since I “have time to be on my phone” I should also be auditing cigarettes. The assistant manager is essentially dumping her morning routine bullshit onto me to do before she gets there. I’m getting really tired of it. If the other shifts would do their job it wouldn’t be that bad. Also if you’re not a manager don’t go around telling other people what to do. ",1,1746986537.0,CircleK,0,1.0,False

My husband knows it’s Mother’s Day. We travelled to spend it with my mom and grandmother. We went shopping for gifts and got cards. I told him he didn’t need to do anything huge for me since things are tight but it would mean a lot to have a small celebration, or get a card or flowers or something. 

But he never said happy Mother’s Day, complained about me wanting to stop for coffee on the way to church this morning (we were 30 minutes ahead of schedule and had time), and hasn’t gotten anything, not even a card. The most he’s done was change her diaper without being asked but still couldn’t be bothered to figure out where the wipes were on his own. We’ve been celebrating my mom and grandma all day and I’m just feeling a little hurt and unacknowledged.

We aim to balance beaches, relaxation, and fewer accommodation changes, leveraging ferries and scenic road routes to reduce travel fatigue. So we were looking into an itinerary such as:

Days 1–3: Base in Split
Explore Split, take a day trip ferry to Hvar, and a short drive to Makarska.

Day 4-5 Drive to Zadar maybe stay 1  night to visit Sea Organ and local beaches.

Day 5-6 Drive to Plitvice Lakes
Nature immersion but stay 1 night near park entrance if no other choice???

Days 7-8 Stay and visit Opatija
Visit Krk island (1 day trip), and explore coastal towns. 

Days 8–10 Stay and explore Rovinj
From here, day trip to Trieste  Or take  ferry or drive to Venice or considering one night in Venice? Or not worth it?

Day 11- 12 Return to Zagreb
Drive inland 3 hours from Rovinj and we would stay near airport if needed?

Is this reasonable or too much? We would also love to know of hidden gems and little family restaurant or coffee shops to explore genuine culture totally off the tourist beaten path ! 

Thanks so much!

1kk727d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kk727d/aitah_for_ending_an_8_year_friendship_over_beer/,"AITAH for ending an 8 year friendship over beer, pot and cigarettes?","Alright Reddit, buckle up for this train wreck. Throwaway because this dude (30M) is still breathing my air and might see it.

I (35F) live across the country from this old friend. We are originally from the same city in another state to where we both currently live and, in a moment of weakness/hospitable idiocy, agreed to host him at his request for a holiday during my precious time off work. My first time off in 3 years.
I envisioned catching up, maybe hitting some local tourist spots I’ve never even seen.

Being the apparently world's biggest doormat, I prepped the guest room like a five-star hotel. Think brand new, crisp linen and fluffy towels. It's a new room, never used. This guy was coming all the way, right?

He initially suggested dates that would have meant me driving a ridiculous 5 hours each way twice in one week. So, being the problem-solver I am, I suggested he fly in a few days earlier. The reward? He gets my spare front-row ticket (worth $260) to see a pop-punk band we both love. Sold out show, had mates practically throwing cash at me for it, but nooo, I thought a nice friendship gesture!

We agreed to split the cost of the extra night of accommodation I’d need in the city because it was a cheaper flight to land a day before my original travel plans. I booked a decent place we both gave a thumbs up to.

Airport pickup day arrives. Despite a ""recent"" photo he’d sent weeks before, I genuinely did a double-take. He wasn't just a bit scruffy; this was full-blown homeless chicc, complete with the unmistakable aroma of a thousand stale cigarettes clinging to him like a second skin. I was floored. The last time I’d seen him, he was all clean cut and professional. And that ""recent"" photo? Turns out it was ancient – a whole year old ancient.

Being the idiotically polite person I am, I shouted him dinner that night – takeout from this amazing, but pricey, Italian place I always treat myself to in the city. Did he let me enjoy my $40 carbonara? Nope. He wolfed down his food like he hadn’t eaten in days and then immediately suggested we go get beer. So, I reluctantly boxed up my food after a mouthful and drove him to a bottle shop in the CBD, despite him having ample time beforehand to get stuff.

Back at the hotel, the ""catching up"" was punctuated every ten minutes by him needing to roll a smoke. It wasn't a casual thing; it was a ritual. TV show? Pause for a smoke. Gossip session? Smoke break. Movie? You guessed it. Look, I don’t care what you do, but constantly interrupting everything was getting annoying.

Now, I’m a tidy person. I respect other people’s spaces, especially when I’m a guest. The state he left the hotel room in? Criminal. Tobacco shreds, rolling papers, filters scattered like confetti, empty beer cans multiplying like rabbits, and just a general aura of filth emanating from his corner. And surprise, surprise, no Venmo request ever materialized for his half of the accommodation.

I had some crucial shopping to do for a job interview – new clothes were a must. Living in a tiny town with limited options and working crazy hours meant this was my only opportunity. He insisted on coming along, which involved him awkwardly trailing me through women’s department stores while I tried to maintain some semblance of social grace despite the discomfort.

Finally, the concert. Six months I’d been waiting for this. We get there, and POOF! He vanishes into the crowd to socialize with strangers. Fine. I grab a drink, find my incredible front-row seat, and send him a screenshot of his ticket and seat number.

Forty minutes later, he reappears with three beers for himself, a lukewarm drink for me, and half a cup of now-stone-cold chips he’d apparently sampled en route. I politely declined his leftovers, mentioned I had my own food and pointed out the first band was starting. I thanked him for the drink and set it aside – not a big drinker, and already had one.

Two songs into the opening act which he declared he “didn’t really like anyway”, he gets up and leaves AGAIN. Okay, rude, but honestly, I was a bit relieved. I texted him updates about the main band starting. He finally reappeared with another three beers and another unwanted drink for me. He’d clearly been at the bar sinking beers and smoking the whole opening act. He came back smelling like a walking chimney and then started MOSHING and throwing his arms around in the seated area. I had to physically move our drinks and apologize to the people around us who had also paid good money for a decent view. This continued the entire main set, only stopping when he went for his frequent bar runs, each time returning with yet another drink I didn’t want after I told him I didn't want to drink anymore. I’m just not comfortable getting drunk, especially around someone acting like this.

I’m not easily embarrassed, but holy hell, I was mortified. You just don’t act like that in public and if you want too, to to GA, but even the venue didn't condone that behavior.. people were pretty mature and respectful even in GA.

After the show, Mr. Social Butterfly wanted to keep mingling. I just wanted to escape back to the hotel for some peace after a mentally and physically exhausting week. Leaving, I bumped into some acquaintances from my town. As I was chatting, he caught up, acting drunk and disorderly, so I awkwardly excused us.

Leaving the venue, he walked straight into a security guard, who naturally asked if he was okay. This sent my “friend” into a bizarre mini-rage. I had to physically pull him back and explain the guard did nothing wrong, he did, which he eventually conceded.

We started walking to find an Uber away from the concert chaos. He was wandering around trying to hug strangers and bumming cigarettes, looking like a disheveled swamp creature who hadn’t seen soap in weeks (seriously, no toothbrush, comb, or toiletries for a TEN-DAY trip!). People were actively avoiding him. I was trying to distance myself.

I ended up walking and talking with some other gig-goers until I found a decent Uber spot. The 15-minute ride back was excruciating. He rambled non-stop about his lack of sex life, his newfound love for living on a boat, life being a “massive pothead” (news to me), and his dislike for Indian food (to our Indian driver. Cue more apologies from me).

Back at the hotel, I was getting ready for bed while he made creepy comments and wouldn’t stop talking at me. For a solid hour, he fixated on which bed I was sleeping in. I finally had to unleash my inner boss girl voice and tell him enough was enough and that we would have a problem if you didn't start respecting what I had been saying for the past hour and to go to bed.

The next day, I was left cleaning up his mess in the hotel. I’m not one to leave a disaster for housekeeping.

He didn’t shower that morning. Then, a delightful five-hour drive back to my house with this biohazard. Seriously, the smell was… potent. I’m a pretty tidy person, even if I have an alternative style. I take pride my appearance and in not smelling like a dumpster fire.

The drive was a monologue about boat life, and he was explaining how he has my bathroom on board but he's showering at the boat club, how amazing it is not having to pay for anything, his medical marijuana prescription he wanted filled (despite me explaining our pharmacies don’t work like that and I don’t partake), and how it’s “mostly recreational” but the prescription keeps him out of trouble in public. He also kept finishing my sentences incorrectly any time I'd try and speak. I just wanted to listen to music; he was actively repelling me.

We stopped at a famous cave about an hour from home. It’s actually pretty cool if you’ve never seen one. He’d never seen anything like it but acted completely disinterested. Didn’t walk with me, didn’t speak, just stood apart from the tour group. No photos, didn’t listen to the guide. Bizarre.

Trying to salvage something, I bought him a small, expensive fossil keychain for his boat keys. He mumbled a thanks and pocketed it.

Finally home. I gave him a tour of my small house. He immediately plonked himself on the couch, turned on my Xbox, and started downloading a game on my main TV. Rude, so I started unpacking. Then, mid-game, he silently got up and went to shower without saying a word to me, now monopolizing my bathroom and main TV.

When he was finally done by mentioned I needed to get food and pet supplies. He tagged along for toiletries, but only wanting beer. He bought a 30-pack. Whilst my house rule is that I don't drink at home I'm fine with someone having a few beers with dinner or something.

I went to bed early for a 13-hour workday. I woke up to a disaster zone – beer cans, smoking paraphernalia everywhere. I cleaned it before work but I was pretty disgusted he left my living area and outside deck looking like a dropped trash can.
No phone allowed at work, so I was unreachable.
I left some cash and a note that if he's going to use my spare car it needs fuel. I was very very reluctant to leave him access to this car as its new and modified and one of my pride and joys.

Came home to find he’d rearranged my outdoor patio furniture and moved my fire pit under my plastic-roofed deck. Seriously? No asking? Inside, more dishes, a broken Xbox controller cable, beer cans. Bathroom covered in his beard shavings. I cleaned it. Again.

Next morning, cleaned up more beer cans. Dishes still there. Coffee grounds everywhere. I was late for work.

Got home after another brutal shift. He was sprawled out, dirty bare feet (black soles!) on my furniture. Guest room was a disaster – clothes everywhere, blankets in heaps, a real plant I keep in there broken and uprooted (how?!), bathroom a biohazard of water and hair, dishes overflowing the sink, coffee powder coating everything, and a mountain of my expensive disposable coffee cups he’d been using as drinking vessels. He’d gone through two weeks’ worth in two days because he “didn’t want to look for a mug.” The mugs were literally right there! He’d also raided my sheds and tools for things he wanted to use, downloaded more games, and used my laundry facilities – all without a word. But asking where a mug was crossed the line?

And the car. My beloved, two-year-old, days prior serviced hot hatch with brand new tires. I told him it needed premium fuel and even left cash. He drove it on fumes and left it in my driveway covered in bird poop. When I realised days later I often why he didn't fill it up and he stated he thought I was just leaving him cash for no reason as if I owed him or something. 

Finally, it's my day off, Thursday. We have a five-hour drive for my job interview interstate. His dad was meeting him nearby for lunch. I made sure we left early so I could drop him off where he wanted to be. After my interview, I called to pick him up. He’d spent the afternoon trying to fill his weed prescription and was 20 minutes south where I dropped him off, so 40 minutes total from where I was. I offered to drive partway; he could Uber the rest. I said I will stop and get some food and by the time he got there I would be on this finished and we could leave while it was still light. However when he arrived, He then ate a whole second lunch and beers while I finishing mine.

The drive home was a hotbox of cigarette and weed fumes. I tried subtle perfume, but it was overwhelming. Four and a half hours of terrifying dark backroads with suicidal kangaroos. He spent the drive rolling more… stuff. Didn’t help with anything, not even cleaning his own rubbish out of the car each time we stopped, and even grabbing my water I just bought after the last stop, claiming a dry throat from his joint.

It's important to note that I’m a well-known professional here. I don’t do that stuff at home and am not comfortable being seen with someone like this. He’s this tall, gaunt dude with dirty, matted hair and clothes that don’t fit. I’m usually in pretty casual but tidy - think clean Vans shoes and hoodies, if I'm not in business attire for work.

On the drive home he argued about wildlife accident stats and tried to mansplain autism to me, scoffing when I corrected him about the facts and consistently telling me I was wrong about things. I actually have autism. He doesn't. Is manner of conversation was unpleasant to be around.

Got home late to find his now three-day-old dishes, including my $350 chef’s knife soaking in the sink stipl. I did them, visibly fuming. He asked what was wrong and if he could help help; I told him that it would be respectful if he did his own housekeeping. I went straight to bed. He stayed up watching TV.

Friday. Exhausted. Had a Zoom interview at 7:30 am my time with the same company I just drove into state for. Got up at 6 to shower and dress. After, I went grocery shopping (still no contribution from him). He did some gardening my edges (fine, not expected but appreciated), but then back to my Xbox, feet on the couch, beers in hand. I spent four hours cooking when I got home because I didn't have anything else to do in my own house but since he was engrossed in my console. His thanks felt fake, complete with a backhanded compliment about a vegan (me) cooking chicken well (I used to be a chef; it’s not rocket science). His whole personality felt forced and fake.

He spent the night outside by my still-under-the-deck fire pit, smoking pot the rest of the night. He made several suggestions that I come outside and drink and sit with him, but I politely declined because sitting around a drunk ice making pot all night generally does not sound like a good time or a social time for me And frankly I find it disrespectful in my home when you were a guest. 

I still tried to be a decent human the following day and took him to the coast. He was silent and disinterested. Same eith visiting historical sites. All he wanted to do was smoke his weed in public. 

On the way back home, we stopped at the supermarket so I could grab something quickly and he wandered off to buy ANOTHER 30pk of beer. This is following on from Monday night slab and Wednesdays two six packs. 
He went back to my deck, now a beer can graveyard, and had at some point gone through my shed to find an extension cord and power adapters to run from my upstairs laundry to power his outdoor video game sessions. There is now a layer of ash, a sooty mix of cigarettes, weed and the cardboard he keeps burning accumulating over my back patio furniture. My back patio table beginning to look like the inside of a crack house with the paraphernalia of he's habits and the rubbish of him barely leaving the vicinity in days. 

Saturday. Officially at my breaking point. Stayed in my room until 10am for peace. He got up when he heard me get up, made coffee, and went back to the deck. I had a “rest day.” Cooked for myself and my neighbors. He smoked and got high the entire day.

Spoke to me at 2pm to ask if I wanted anything from the shops; he returned with more beer. I called my dad to vent. Didn’t cook the big roast dinner I said I would because I felt my hospitality was being taken for granted. He finally asked if I was okay after I told him I didn't feel like cooking anymore. I laid it all out: concert behavior, disrespect for my home, the drinking, his appearance, his choices pushing me away, my home being my sanctuary and outlining a multitude of disrespectful behavior he had shown over the past week.

He also attempted to gaslight me about splitting costs, stayed in here made several attempts at asking for my bank information and I hadn't been forthcoming. I showed him proof none of that was correct and he had made no attempts during conversation online or in person to pay his share. He just said he was 'sorry things have worked out this way' and fine with the friendship ending, then went back to smoking pot and drinking.

Oh, and THC can be toxic to dogs. My two Frenchies have been locked inside most nights because he’s out there smoking until midnight. I’m not sleeping because I have to wait until he goes to bed so I can take them outside for toilet and then again before he gets up in the morning. 

There are a million other little things, but you get the gist of how he has been a terrible house guest. 

I just want to make it clear that I have no problem with people smoking like chimneys or getting stoned and drunk but do it in your time and you know place that it's considerate to do so like your own house or your friends house who also partake in that kind of behavior and not in somebody that you know for a fact set the higher standard in their personal life and their home life. I'm a working professional and I have worked very hard to give myself a comfortable life, working for everything I have with no handouts, so I take a lot of pride in my home and my reputation.

Besides the expense of setting up a guest room, I've also spent $450 on fuel for our travels and $260 on a ticket, $300 on food and take away and $320 on accommodation and all I've asked for is $160 of the accommodation which was agreed upon when we planned and when I booked and last week before he flew out. 

So, AITA for telling him his airport drop-off on Tuesday will be his farewell tour? I feel guilty, but I’m beyond done.

TL;DR: Old friend's visit was a non-stop disaster of filth, rudeness, freeloading, and general disrespect. I'm ending the friendship. AITA?

Edit: he's angry at me because I'm not accepting of his lifestyle choices but these are not choices he was upfront about nor choices he made when I knew him previously and his choices are negatively impacting my comfort in my own home. ",1,1746986324.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I was diagnosed with asthma at 6 years old. So everytime I breath too loud or needed to breath more I linked it to my asthma. I started drinking coffee at 12  years old because I told my mom I was too tired to do homework all the time and I remember feeling exhausted everyday in school. At 16 I had to start taking natural pills to be able to fall asleep, and couldn´t keep going most days without at least two coffees. At 18 I got diagnosed with extrasystoles (a heart issue) and was adviced by doctors to not to drink more than one cup of coffee per day.  So I had to stick to that. I started uni and I choose to have evenning classes because it was a nightmare for me to wake up early and the more days I tried, the more tired I was until I have a mental breakdown out of tiredness. On top of that I got diagnosed with ADHD, dislexia, discalculia and NVLD (a dissability similar to autism) at 20. I started medication for ADHD, but not of them worked and the last one I tried made my extrasystoles 10 times worse. It came to a point that I couldn´t drink coffee, or tea or anything caffeine related because I will have extrasystoles. Learning to live without coffee made me realise that I may have a sleeping issues, I used to think I was always tired because all the dissabilities that I have and lack of medication for ADHD but it may not be the case? 

Some things that may be symptoms: 

I never snore, but I do feel out of breath when I\`m trying to sleep. I don´t remember if  it was the same way when I was a child and as coffee helped me to sleep too I don´t remember as a teen either. If I sleep A LOT (about 9-10 hours) contiously I feel fresh and energyzed. If I wake up at any hour before I inteded to, it\`s super hard for me to fall sleep again. I don\`t recalll specifically waking up because of feeling like I can´t breath (it happens usually because I´m senstive to noises)  but I do feel it while trying to get back to sleep. Also I read that people with asthma and ADHD are more likely to have apnea but I don´t know. What do you guys think? ",1,1746986083.0,SleepApnea,1,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I are planning our first travel together this June for 5 days. We both live in Vienna and would love to visit Italy :) We are both students, so we are a bit on a budget. We were hoping to find some people on here with good insight where to travel to.

Some thoughts we had:

  
\- We are looking for a sweet little town, with not too many tourists and ideally a sand beach not too far away. We were thinking it would be nice if it had a few nice coffee places, bars, souvenir shops, books shops, etc. to relax during the day.

\- Ideally it would be nice to reach from Austria, so maybe on the northern side of Italy.

\- I myself unfortunately really suck with heat so it would be amazing to be somewhere below 40C

\- Food wise all is good, just good Italian local food with maybe some good white wine.

  
Do you have any tipps or hidden gems in mind from your experience :))?

1kk6uqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1kk6uqy/irl_shilling_with_kendu/,Irl shilling with $Kendu,"**My first Reddit post!**

I felt the need to say something about spreading the $Kendu brand name. If you have read Reddit posts from Kendu before, you know that we work both online and offline. We have a lot of amazing products under the Kendu brand, such as Kendu energy, Kendu gaming, Kendu coffee, Kendu beers etc. We also sponsor irl events and the street team has made some amazing murals! Some chads/chadettes have been putting stickers everywhere, put posters out, paid billboards (I see you EAC Marketing) or have been spreading flyers. There are so many ways to promote $Kendu! This community is such an inspiration and really stimulates everyone to work for their bags.

***“It’s not about what Kendu can do for you, but about what you can do for Kendu”***

With 18k holders we have a large community. Everyone has their own skill set and at $Kendu we stimulate to use that skill set! For example; Akabe created a Kendu mask that you can make at home. Akabe himself is wearing his mask while making drumming videos (he’s an amazing drummer!). You Kendu anything while wearing the Kendu mask and soft shill different markets. Kendufy everything!

***So think for yourself; what can YOU do for $Kendu?***

I myself like to walk in nature with my dog. Can that be used to shill Kendu? YES, yes it can! I downloaded the Geocache app and now my dog and I are looking for Geocaches in our area. When found, I add a Kendu sticker and (if possible) a Kendu keychain. The next person to find that Geocache will be in luck!

Another unexpected shill opportunity (I think) is when you go grocery shopping. I just ordered a bunch of shopping cart tokens with the Kendu logo and website. So next time I go shopping, I’ll leave the token in the shopping cart!

You don’t have to go out of your way, just bring Kendu shill material wherever you go! I hope this inspired you to come up with ways to spread that $Kendu love yourself!

Now get out there and have fun!

YOU KEN DU IT!!

1kk6osc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1kk6osc/in_need_of_help_i_dont_want_this_divorce_is_this/,"In need of help. I don't want this divorce. Is this attachment, walkaway wife, or denial...","I'm not sure if this is even the right place. I feel like my I am on a cliff, my toes hanging over the edge and each minute gives thought to either leap or take a breath to quiet my mind. What is happening right now? This is like a nightmare. I feel like its some kind of a cruel joke that I've involuntarily been asked to take the lead role. 
Its been 3 weeks since the words ""i think i want a divorce"" filled my ears. Not one hour prior to my brushing my hand along her back, kissing her, and ""saying I love you"". We had plans for the future, our shared calendar showed dates, appointments, trips, and plans we both had for each other. 

It started with a hike the day before those words were spoken. The plan was to drop her off early so we could meet halfway while I would go back to start a longer leg with her friends. Long story short, we spent 4 hours apart while we both navigated the time/place we would connect. After meeting she had a smile from ear to ear. ""What a great day!"" She said. ""I did that all on my own"", i was so proud of her. Once back to the car, she said to the group, ""I had this epiphany while i was out there, my phone was useless, I just hiked knowing I was going to get through it"". No mention of divirce, or any words of dissolving 10 years of marriage (I, 47M her, 40F). We drove home the next day with both of us content over the great trip we had just embarked on with her friends.then that night was when she said it. 
""I realized that I can things on on my own, and Im realizing this relationship i'snt going to change. And because of this epiphany, I know that I think I want a divorce"". 
The start of a cascading affect of our world as I knew it. 
Back story, we started like any other couple. I was coming off a long rerm relationship, and she was coming off a 9yr marriage that she no longer wanted to be in. I was adamant about creating and remaining friends until after a couple of years, we just couldn't fight the universe. We wanted to be together, we were magnetized by one another. We went through years of joy, moving, loss of jobs and rebuilding, losing our fathers close together, dynamics that are normal to our everyday life while we occupy this planet. What i would consider normal...
Around year 7 she started to mention dissatisfaction in her job, in her career. Small mentions of ""we dont do the things we used to, and remember when we first were together? We were all over each other"". I took note as she was feeling a bit lost in her path, i reassured her that whatever stresses she was feeling, I would be by her side. 
Moving forward, year 9-10. Still unhappy with work and wanting to go back to school for a degree was a main topic. She had been back and forth about taking the helm of the families book-keeping & day to day needs. I would ask if I could do something and she would say ""its ok because I don't want to have to explain it, you won't do it right"" would be said. I noticed her starting to fade as she was only working one day a week and I was working contract jobs that would last from 2-3weeks to 3-4months.money stress was a very present anxiety. Statements like ""I don't need you to fix it"", ""it just feels like you don't have empathy for me"", ""you just think of yourself and not my wants"", ""I feel like im being dismissed"", ""I just want you to follow through and take accountability"", ""do you know how lonely it is being with you?"" Started.

After those words were said, it all seems like a blur. I asked how this could be worked on. I said it doesn't need to be this extreme. We can work on this and focus on getting our marriage back to a place she could feel that confidence and commitment. She said she had made up her mind. She mentioned going our of town to clear her head as she had been wanting to go back to the small mountain town she had lived in 20 years prior. I thought nothing of it at the time. ""Ok, If you need to clear your head and think about this, I understand"". I said. And that night I slept on the sofa. 

The next few days I racked my brain as to WTF was happening. I obviously begged, cried, pleaded, everything thing each ""get your marriage back"" site had suggested never to do. She had told me she was going to file a petition for divorce and it would take a few months to unravel our finances, assests, etc. 
*we have no children, 2 pets, we rent our lovely home and do not live lavishly.
 ""It's for the best and I need to you get behind me on this"" were words used. ""This is just as hard on me to break your heart"" , ""you can blame this all on me"". Are you serious?! I don't want this divorce. I am trying to communicate on how we can work on this knowing that we don't have to do this. 
I felt lost and helpless. I went through every step in my head. What is really going on? I kept saying...

In those days following I remembered her mentioning that an old friend/ex had liked our photos (obviously shared IG, and signs of co-dependence) and I thought nothing of. But by now my thoughts were swimming. Is there someone else? Why would this be happening? 
I opened the car door to the Uber, begged her not to do this, and told her please don't choose to end this marriage. And so she left for 4 days. 

I spiraled, looked for support from our friends, I cried daily and let my mind take me to the darkest places. I assumed and placed scenarios, and grasped at how I could get my wife back...

After she came back, I couldn't be at the house. It was a constant reminder of the last 10 years of our life. The photos the knick-nacks, the daily routines of making coffee and bringing her a cup while she was in bed. It was too much. I had to get away. I spent a week camping and dragging one of pups en-tow. She would sit silently as I would cry, confess, and try to figure out what the he'll was happening.
This is where I am starting to get lost.

We share everything, our calendar, a site that has all our secure passwords, our credit cards and a social account. *she changed the social account during her trip. She made it private and changed her name to her prior non-married name. Her other pages reflected the same.The knife felt like it kept being turned inside of me.

That's when I noticed it. Her password had been changed on her email that stated the date and first kiss, exclamation. (A----FIRSTKISS!)
WTF! I was so confused that it had to be wrong. 

Over the next few days i needed to gather myself and find a way to sit down with her without breaking down and pleading once again. 
By this time she was treating me like our relationship never existed, no love no compassion, nothing. 
We sat down and I blatantly asked if she connected with someone on her trip. ""Lately I connected with alot of people, I've been happy to connect with friends and it makes me feel good"".
I asked again if she met with ""this"" particular friend and she said yes. ""Did anything happen?"" She said ""no, nothing"". Then I asked about the password. She flipped and said that was a violation of her privacy and that we need to start discussing the separation of our information. ""He kissed me while he was visiting me for dinner"" was her next statement. ""He is just a friend"" ""I wouldn't just be with someone for sh#$ ans giggles, give me some credit"". 
She then went into a statement that started with ""I told you when we first started dating, that when there becomes a point where I start to possibly see myself or be curious about others, I start to 'check-out' of the relationship"". ""If we weren't married, we would have been over on the day I said I wanted a divorce"". 
I asked what her plans were and she said she wanted to move. Go back to a small town, finish the journey of self love she was set out for by the epiphany she felt on that hike. 
No plans on where to live, where to work, but just wanting to get out, move, and focus on herself. ""You don't understand, this is about me, not someone else, this marriage was killing me"", she said.
To add insult to injury, she mentioned in a text that I should notice the calender and some dates coming up. ""I won't be staying at the house on these dates"". And through further forensics, I discovered that this 'friend' is traveling to town to see her. She rented a cabin ""cozy/romantic stay in the woods"". I asked her about this and she said he was just a friend. ""despite what you think. Im not relationship hopping just because somebody kissed me. For goodness sake. Give me more credit than that.  In the last year I've curated friendships with people, and its been a beautiful thing. Even my therapist brought it up again, this am.""

In all of this, I've still wanted her back, I want our life back, I love her and devoted my choice to love, cherish and protect her, till death do you part...
My communication still contains statements that growth and progress. 
-""I'm sorry if I failed to show you how much you mean to me. 
This choice doesn't have to be concrete. There is fluidity in marriage through growth, empathy, progress and most of all, love. We still have that for each other. 10 years doesn't just fall away. I support that you've sought out the tools to love yourself, and that passion amazing. That passion can still be used heal and mend what is happening to us. I won't let you down, I will be by your side and commit to this each day. 

We find ourselves here, today. I sit on a sofa in an apartment lent from a friend who is traveling for work. I've now been seeing a therapist 2 days a week. I've enrolled in a new certification class (she had wanted me to go back to school during the pandemic to releive anxiety ftom the financial stress we had been feeling, on top of her not wanting to go back to thhe job industry she despised, food and beverage). I continued to run, cycle and do whatever I can to exhaust myself from thinking about this. She remains home at our home, packing boxes and preparing to go somewhere. She has left everything that contains our photos, our wedding pictures, her rings, everything that contains 'us' she is packing as if she is going off to live in a studio apartment with her camping gear, her clothes, her make up and the kitchen gadgets she deemed hers before our marriage...
We agreed that cohabitation would not work as I am still too emotional and can't bare to be witness to this. 

I've asked her plans for the next weeks and they keep oscillating. 
She's made statements saying that its so relevant that she has nothing figured out, but she can't help that. ""We were not in the relationship we set out for, and there was no growth or progress"". She tried to convince me from our conversations about therapy that I'm already growing and having great moments of realizations. ""But I'm not the bad guy because I'm the one who ended things"". She's said. ""This is about me, whether you believe it or not, and it's still difficult, even if you don't see it. I'm the who had the ""courage"" to upend my life and break your heart"".

So now I ask you, everyone. 
What am I doing? Am I the one in denial? Do I need to wake up from what I feel might be the long term effects of being with someone who was narcissistic? Am I the victim? Or is she just bailing out and I am so foolish to see it? 
Why do I want this marriage back? I love her, i miss what we shared and chershed for each other. Why does it seem easier to just leap off the edge vs face what's happening?

I was unlucky that my doc did not caution me about the rebound symptoms and everytime I ised to go for follow ups, he used to just put me a fre months more on PPI( probably it was just re bound and tappering off would have helped). Fast forward 3 years later, I am trying hard to taper off PPI ( currently on 20mg PPI every third day comfortably)

I consulted a new GI doctor who mentioned that I switch completely to famotidine 40mg in the morning, which I did for a week but it gives me stomach burning slightly during the day and good amount of burning towards the evening to when I sleep.

I am planning to consult the doctor again and ask if I can take PPI as well in between and increase the spacing like every 3rd day for a couple of weeks to every 4th day a couple of weeks and keep taking famotidine 40mg in the morning and maybe ask him to add 40mg in the evening as well. I am eating clean with no or less trigger foods like coffee, greasy or spicy food.


Does my taper schedule looks like a good idea based on your experiences?

Reason for PPI stopping: Started giving me bad bloating and consitpation. Food used to tske forever to digest. I also take Unienzyme digestive supplement to help with bloating and all.

The moment I had switched to famotidine all those bloating and all was gone. 

I want to get rid of this dependency on meds and start eating back my fav foods after I give up on PPI :(",1,1746985315.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Which is very unlike me, I'm normally an over caring and kind person. And in all honesty it just makes me sad, to think there will never be that kind of nice relationship between us. Which I guess a few years ago it was there. But now it's not and hasn't been for about a year. 
From about January this year, she has texted me every few weeks , a similar thing saying ""hi how are you both, haven't seen you for a while love and miss you both"". I have been replying with the pleasantries and offering to go over, but she never replies or I phone her , and she hasn't returned a single call to me. 
What I have discovered is she sends the exact message to her son at the same time, every time.

Sometimes I've immediately replied or called her, and hours or days later get a text saying sorry just looked at my phone or sorry I was eating I just don't understand what she's playing at. 

My husband works different days and shifts to me so I'd say its 50/50 chance we are in or off together. That's life. We both love our jobs. So we can't always visit her together.  She knows this. Especially as he works a lot of nights. 

Before she became this contamperous opinionated bag, I would go there on my own for coffee every so often after work, I'd just call up and be welcomed over. But I'd say for about a year , she's not answered my calls, or willingly made any sort of effort with me. Yet sends these messages ? Why? If she clearly has no intention with me. 


For context, I've heard her be really cold towards her own husbands family saying things like I'm not interested in his family, I'm only interested in my own blood.

1kk6n0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1kk6n0s/pathetic/,Pathetic,"Hi guys. I posted here once already under another throwaway. Honestly I’m asking for help but I am so fucking dense I probably will end up doing what I always do anyway, so let’s just take this as some sort of a vent. I’ve known this guy for seven years right? At first I didn’t pay him no mind he was just there. Something changed about two years ago. For a little context, he is older than me, quite extroverted and way out of my league. Now I know that’s childish and I don’t actually share that view when it comes to others, I somehow do when it comes to me.I know I’m boring, quite shallow, a lot of narcissistic traits too. But when it’s just me that’s okay, I’m okay with that. That’s kind of NOT the point though. Although it relates to my point?

 Well, some of our mutual friends tried to set us up with little comments here and there. Honestly they annoyed me back then. I knew that some of our friends liked to fuck around and mess with people pretending that someone likes them. So when I heard these comments I immediately shut them down just nodding along but rolling my eyes. However, after a while, I noticed that this guy would glance at me more and more. That escalated into him staring a lot. Then he started actually coming up to me, making jokes and small talk. Now you guys, I still had it in my dense head that he’s probably fucking with me. So I was always nice but I didn’t engage too much. 

But then it escalated even more. He would wait for me wherever I was to come and talk to me. Always always initiated by him. And I would honestly sometimes be quite mean to him. Maybe not outright mean, but if someone acted that way to me, as I acted to him, I would honestly never talk to them again. But he did. Again and again he would come and make jokes or talk to me. He brought me chocolate and coffee. So yeah after these two years of interacting it got into my head that hey, maybe he wasn’t fucking around. 

Actually now thinking back through the two years we interacted he did ask me out  and you guys do you know what I did? I laughed at him. I scoffed ,and he was like no I’m being serious, and I just said and what would we do? Jesus Christ I am always such a bitch to him. Now bear in mind, these two years we’ve been interacting I did like him. Like I do like him a lot. But I don’t know why I’m being such a cold mean bitch to him. But now, we are at a point where I’m trying to avoid him regardless, because it’s awkward. A few times I was like wow he will definitely not speak to me ever again, like after some times when I blatantly ignored him but no, he still comes around. What the hell do I do with him? I would never confront him about this and I am literally going insane now. I move on and I think I have moved on but then he comes up to me saying some cute shit and I realise I never really moved on. 

Honestly I don’t know what to do. I’m just being tortured by his presence and that’s that. So yeah. I don’t know. If you read all of this I’m sorry honestly.  Oh! Another mean thing I did to him? He gave me his instagram and asked me to follow him but I didn’t. Honestly he is too nice for me. But then why does he still come baaaaaack??? Maybe he has some kind of a fetish like he’s a masochist or something? Maybe he’s enjoying this? Lmao, I’m only joking but still. Oh and also another thing why did I decide to write this? Because out of nowhere I had a dream where he was with a girl and I started tweaking. Literally I woke up in cold sweat and I felt like my life was ruined. You know when you wake up and you still have that dream fresh in your mind? Yeah I was literally tweaking. So here I am venting about this now. ",1,1746985233.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1kk6m2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kk6m2n/coffee_ground_emesis_or_anxiety_over_nothing/,Coffee ground emesis or anxiety over nothing?,"Hi, posting here because I can get very anxious about possible health issues and I don’t wanna work myself into a panic if this is nothing. This might be way too long and rambly, but I’ve tried to make it readable. The main issue is I threw up clear liquid with brown flakes in it with no food in my stomach which would cause that; most of this post is context since I’ve been dealing with a really weird GI problem already. I will try to post the picture I took of it in the comments. Non-GI diagnoses are generalized anxiety disorder, unspecified mood disorder, and inattentive type ADHD. 

I’m 22yo afab 190 lbs. For almost exactly a year I’ve had frequent nausea and vomiting with no apparent cause which is exacerbated by movement and speaking. I’ve had blood tests, stool test, x ray, abdominal ultrasound, inner ear test, CT scan of abdomen and head, and an endoscopy, all of which have come back normal minus blood tests showing mild anemia which I’m fairly certain I’ve had before this started but I don’t have any older test results on hand. My symptoms are more manageable with some of the anti-nausea meds I’m on but nothing has eradicated it completely. My most recent GI visit from a month ago I was told that I seem to have chronic functional nausea/vomiting and that basically all we can do is mitigate symptoms as I have been doing.  

I have vomiting fits at least once every few days and the severity varies between only a couple minutes and close to 30 on a really bad day. This has been happening for a year; only symptoms have been the nausea and vomiting, and what I eat and drink do not effect the level of nausea, and I have had no abdominal pain out of the very, very infrequent ordinary and absolutely no blood in vomit or stool (ordinary pain as in, if I’ve eaten something that would make someone without my problem or even me prior to a year ago have that pain or regular pain stemming from my periods, and by “pain” I just mean like, stomachache level). 

(All meds I’m on are sertraline (75mg) and lamotrigine (150mg)—doses monitored by my psychiatric provider, and which I have been on for years—and scopolamine patches (1mg/3 days), omeprazole (20 mg once a day), and the most recent (like, just got it a couple days ago but I don’t think it’s the cause because I’ve taken it once because I keep forgetting to take it) med is nortriptyline at 10 mg dose to be taken before bed ordered by the latest GI dr I’ve seen. I’ve had a couple other anti-nausea meds but haven’t been on them in several months because of concerns about layering meds.) 

On the anemia, the same GI dr who prescribed the nortriptyline suggested I have a colonoscopy to address it, as she said it wasn’t the “genetic type” (my mom has anemia) but she did not frame it as urgent since she said heavy periods was the most likely cause and that it *could* be slow GI bleeding but it wasn’t likely, so because of cost and the lack of urgency I opted against it.

So far I’ve never thrown up anything out of the ordinary (ie only bile/water if I haven’t eaten, digested food if I have), but today I threw up what was a mostly clear liquid with brown flakes in it. Been awake for about 5 hours at time of making this post and have only had a couple slices of lunch meat about 10-12 hours ago in the last 24 hours (not uncommon for me and not for any eating disorder reasons; I have emetophobia and if I’m already severely nauseous then throwing up liquid is less distressing. I still eat at least once a day, but it’s definitely less than before this started because I’ve lost about 30 pounds over the course of this year—current weight is 190 so it’s not an urgent problem). I’ve only had some water and about half of a 16.9 fl oz Dr. Pepper which I’ve been drinking slowly; I will note that on occasions where I’ve thrown up a drink which is dark in color, it is only ever liquid. It has *never* made chunks or flakes in otherwise clear vomit which is why I realized even if it’s not serious, something has changed.

The last couple of days I’ve been fairly dehydrated as well despite drinking water (I get a little dehydrated often with frequent vomiting but this is to a level abnormal even for me, and I have not increased the amount of coffee or soda I drink, which is infrequent). I attributed this to it getting warmer out and our house not having central AC, but I also have some slight abdominal discomfort (not really *pain*, almost a pressing sensation near my lower belly and maybe a slight ache now and then which is similar to but a little different to how constipation feels). HOWEVER: I only consciously noticed this after googling “brown flakes in vomit” and learning about CGE so I feel like it might just be my anxiety.

My most recent blood panel from April 28th marked my hemoglobin, MCV, and MCH as low (11.4, 72, and 21.8 respectively) and my RDW as high (15.9) with everything else in normal range. 

I recently had to go to the ER for an unrelated issue (was prescribed a low dose of trazodone for sleep and started having heart palpitations and mild chest discomfort. everything checked out and it stopped within a couple days of stopping the trazodone after notifying my psych provider) so I don’t want to make another trip if it’s nothing since money is really tight for my family right now.

1kk6llt,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1kk6llt/help_me_please/,*HELP ME PLEASE!*,"Hi everyone! I am a male (25-30) experiencing eczema all over my body. I have been seeing a dermatologist for six months, who only prescribed steroid-based creams such as triamcinolone for my body and Opzelura for my face. The steroid creams did not work for me, and I stopped using them two weeks ago. However, Opzelura works for my face, although I do not have severe facial eczema (so I am continuing to use Opzelura on my face).

About two weeks ago, I changed my diet and now mostly eat chicken, beef, lamb, fish, potatoes, rice (twice a week), and a few other vegetables(asparagus, lettuce). I have completely stopped consuming alcoholic beverages, bread, and coffee (I used to be a heavy coffee drinker until two weeks ago).

To provide more context, I have been dealing with eczema since birth, but it was never severe—mostly affecting my arms and legs, with only occasional need for treatment. However, six months ago, eczema rashes suddenly spread all over my body with intense itching, which led me to see a dermatologist.

I also decided to get a blood test to ensure nothing else was wrong, and fortunately, all results were normal. I have been using acid reducers for a year now (Kirkland acid reducers) and currently use CVS Famotidine. Additionally, I started taking vitamin D (4,000 IU per day) three days ago, hoping it would alleviate my eczema.

Unfortunately, I have noticed that whenever I use any hydrating ointments, such as CeraVe, Aquaphor, or Vaseline, they cause such intense itching that I cannot sleep and feel like tearing my skin apart. Currently, my skin loses moisture at an alarming rate, cracking by itself when I wake up in the morning. However, I do not believe I am consuming anything that triggers allergies (I use high-quality cotton clothes, fragrance-free detergent, maintain a clean, dust-free room, and work mostly from home).

I have a patch test scheduled for next week, but I am unsure if it will help since I am eating only one meal a day, mostly fasting in the morning, and avoiding any creams, soaps, or unnecessary products (I only use an eczema-friendly shampoo).

I want to avoid using anything like Dupixent (as I do not believe anything dermatologists say), so please help me by suggesting solutions that have worked for you (anything gut related? probiotics?). To sum up, my eczema is not extremely severe (no flakes or open wounds), but my skin (specially my back) gets extremelyyyyy dry, cracks by itself, burns, and prevents me from sleeping, verrrrry itchyyyyy :(

1kk6k9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kk6k9u/i_learned_that_a_startups_name_can_function_as_a/,I Learned That a Startup’s Name Can Function as a Strategic Asset—Not Just a Label,"Over the past few months, I’ve been exploring how early-stage startups position themselves for traction — especially during the critical pre-launch phase. One surprising insight I’ve uncovered is how a well-chosen name, especially a premium .com, can act as an underappreciated strategic asset, not merely a branding decision.

Here’s what I learned:

1. A Good Name Signals Credibility

In a saturated digital ecosystem, trust is scarce. A professional-sounding name can act as a proxy for legitimacy. This is especially true in sectors like fintech, legal tech, and AI, where users are more cautious and investors are more risk-averse. A name like “[TrustFore](https://trustfore.com)” (implying both trust and foresight) naturally conveys authority, even before a user sees the product.

2. The Name Becomes Part of the User Experience

People often underestimate how often a startup’s name gets mentioned — in conversation, in presentations, on investor decks, in media coverage. A short, memorable name like “[TopTalon](https://toptalon.com)” doesn’t just look good on a logo — it’s easier to share, remember, and internalize. This lowers acquisition friction, especially in consumer-facing categories like esports, cybersecurity, or fashion tech.

3. The Right Name Can Pre-Align with a Niche Audience

Take, for example, “[RizzFi](https://rizzFi.com).” It fuses two cultural markers: “Rizz” (modern slang for charisma or charm) and “Fi” (short for finance or fintech). Without needing explanation, it speaks to a very specific, youth-driven market — those interested in creator-led finance tools or gamified fintech. In this way, a name can act as a targeting mechanism.

4. It’s a Fundraising Tool

Investors don’t just evaluate products — they evaluate narratives. And strong branding enhances narrative clarity. “[Revinance](https://revinance.com)” (a portmanteau of ‘refinance’ and ‘revive’) gives investors a quick mental model of what the startup is trying to do. In fundraising, memorability and clarity often trump complexity.

5. It Can Be an Appreciating Asset

Like trademarks or patents, a strong domain name can increase in value independently of the product it represents. In some cases, domain names have been acquired or licensed post-acquisition, simply because they carry independent brand equity. This is rarely discussed in traditional startup playbooks, but can be relevant in exit planning.


---

In Summary:
I used to view naming as a creative exercise — something to brainstorm over coffee and whiteboards. But I’ve since learned that strategic naming is closer to product strategy, market positioning, and even investor relations. It’s a small lever that can have outsized impact.

I now look at startup names the way I might look at product-market fit signals — early indicators that a founder understands their audience and their positioning.

Has anyone else experienced this? Would love to hear thoughts from startup founders, branding professionals, or investors.",1,1746985029.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

[Breville Bambino],"So our old coffee machine broke and I decided to buy a Breville Bambino, since I heard good things about this coffee maker on reddit. Now that I've unboxed it and tried to make a few coffees, I'm coming across a few unexpected issues. I hope someone can give me a hand :)

1. Is this a good/reliable coffee machine for daily morning use?
2. Most of my espresso's have been a little hotter than lukewarm; Aside from blank shots, is there any other way to pre-heat or ensure a hotter brew?
3. If it's not possible with this machine on it's own, are there any accessories I can purchase that would help with a warmer/hotter brew?
4. Similar to my previous questions, is there anyway to achieve a warmer temp when steaming the milk? If not, are there any accessories I could use?

For context, I've worked as a barista in my past (they used like a semi-auto old, not as sophisticated, Marzocco style Group 4 machines, with a separate grinder; predetermined amounts but no built in grinder), so I'm not entirely inexperienced, but it's definitely a different ball game.

\---

She had time before the proper meet-and-greet. She’d double-checked that everything she’d requested or had had moved onto the ship was present in her quarters.

Ruth laid on her bed, the door locked, fiddling with a circlet with an opaque visor attached to the front. She debated. She thought of going out there with an incomplete perspective. She needed a reminder, to be *grounded* and *open-minded*.

She could not afford to screw up her first day on the job. She put the device on.

“Initiate the predescribed mental simulation.”

She went to sleep without actually losing consciousness.

**\*\*\***

Ruth Shaw woke up standing on the corner of an old road lazily winding through a hilly landscape. A small incline led down into an idyllic little lake that sat quiet and still between the road and several much larger, heavily wooded rises. At the bend in the road maybe thirty feet away a quaint, old style cottage watched over the water like a bored but determined sentry.

*Is this really what I picture when I think of Earth?* It was a much more… Mundane scene than Ruth had thought her subconscious would conjure up.

As she thought about it, a grand, towering series of skyscrapers started rising up over the bigger mounds framing the other side of the lake. They were bright, energy in a rainbow of colors swirling around their tops in listless clouds. She could hear distant vehicle sounds and the pounding of limbs against sidewalks - not just human ones - far clearer than she’d reasonably be able to this far away.

“...Right. Have to focus.” She couldn’t let bias ruin the mental simulation. She rubbed her temples and forced herself to focus *only* on the topic she wanted to see.

She was suddenly inside the cottage. It was a lot less rustic inside. The shift in environment greeted her with sterile padded walls, wall-embedded screens and monitors, and lifeline beeping that immediately started irritating her because she had no idea where it was actually coming from. She squinted at one of the monitors, but there was no actual data displayed.

Registering the gap in information made it present itself promptly: a human appeared in the middle of the room. Ruth found herself on the other side of a pane of thick, reinforced, mineral-veined glass. It shined faintly when she tilted her head at it.

An alien doctor appeared. Rather, a hab officer, just like her, in muted blue-yellow with the *IIC* badge confirming their purpose from its spot on the alien’s shoulder. It was an illud, cattish and pale. It swiped its claws across a datapad and observed the human subject, who wore nothing more than a hospital gown.

“Officer Ruth Shaw is human, originating from a frontier colony in the Parmalan Ascendancy. She is deeply religious but refuses to acknowledge it in front of others-”

“Hey, just a moment-”

“-And clearly has trauma that needs to be worked on but which she refuses to deal with despite it being a blatant social hazard.”

“I did *not* start this simulation to give myself therapy.”

The alien looked at her. So did the human patient, which Ruth was starting to realize looked a lot like herself.

She was starting to regret this whole ordeal.

The illud hab officer sighed deeply and rolled its eyes. It turned back to the subject. “Humans do not need complex temperature, air, or gravity control, being most happy with an enforced medium between current galactic sapient-friendly averages. Long term exposure to sufficiently off-range temps and pressures will, eventually, cause lasting damage. Simple equipment will remedy most discrepancies…”

Ruth watched herself be set on fire, frozen solid, deprived of oxygen, implode from pressure imbalance, and then finally relax with a nice cup of coffee in a very soft-looking chair that suddenly appeared. The other Ruth conjured up a book with a title in Parmalan trade speech that read; *Interspecies Friendships for Above-Average Idiots.*

The actual Ruth made a mental note to examine her self-esteem after this was over.

“...As a human who has experienced dampening-” The illud glanced at Ruth in a way that felt unnaturally knowing. “-She is, thank her stars, still theoretically one-day-talented in empathic ability despite the inadequacy. Most humans are only at the rough point where they can use most common tools but display no strong aptitude for actual prima-emotional power.”

“This was a stupid idea.” Ruth shook her head and crossed her arms.

“What this means for everyone else is you can toss her in a mind storm with a sturdy suit and have her be fairly likely to come out unscathed or, at least, not broken. She can still use comm-links, operate certain vehicles, and so on and so forth… Something something human adaptability.” The illud figment suddenly turned on a clawed foot towards Ruth.

Ruth paused in the middle of starting to exit back to reality.

“What was the point of this, Ruthie?”

The other Ruth looked at the actual Ruth, human and alien staring her down. She swallowed. “I just wanted to remind myself what I looked like from the outside.”

“You know you don’t have to do that. ‘Everyone is an alien to someone’ is something you practically tell yourself in your sleep.” The illud walked up to her, taking her chin in its clawed hands and turning her face up towards it. “You passed training with flying colors. You’re ready.”

“I know that, I-” Ruth grabbed its hand with both of hers.

“The best of mankind are those who look at the stars and see something beautiful. Who will stop at nothing to make themselves comfortable in the offerings of the void. All that is strange and new is welcome, for we are not alone and the word for friend can truly have no limits.” The alien was suddenly wearing a philosopher's robes.

Ruth glanced at the other Ruth. She was in the chair again, with a book, but now she was drinking Parmalan alcohol - the *fancy* stuff - and reading something titled *The Role of Man in a Sea of Lives*.

“Is this my psyche’s way of telling me I’m pretentious?”

“I think you’re just *scared* that you are and that all you’re really going to see out there is a lot of people hurting each other.”

Ruth said nothing. She just frowned. She heard the other Ruth loudly sip her drink, pinkie extended.

“The most important habitation need for a human-” The illud was wearing a hab officer uniform again. “-Is knowing that things are a lot easier than they seem. They require healthy social relationships, balanced environments, and if not purpose then consistent comfort. In an ideal humanity… A good human will seek a world where new horizons are a constant, and where they can settle down without difficulty wherever they choose.”

The illud crossed its arms, letting go of her now. “Do you still believe that?”

“I think so.” Ruth answered immediately.

“Then I think you’ll be okay.” The illud smiled. “Before you go, though, you need to address the fact you’ve been feeling quite lonely lately. Your options are pretty broad going forward, and the IIC does not condemn-”

“End prima-tesseract simulation.” The world faded away before Ruth could finish reading the questionable title on the other her’s next book.

**\*\*\***

Ruth came back to reality rubbing her face until the mobile simulation circ fell off her head and clattered to the floor. She stared at her books, at her simple little accommodations. She thought of how much effort secretly went into making it ideal for her: the systems in the walls actively modulating everything from the heat to the oxygen she breathed.

Perfectly balanced, constantly filtered. Nothing would spill over and mix from the other quarters and kill her. Not as long as everyone did their job and was aware of everyone’s needs.

Not as long as she made the right calls. Saw the right sides.

She forced herself out of bed and went to the bridge. She tried to compose herself and manage a smile ahead of time.

**\*\*\***

Stell watched Ruth Shaw enter the bridge from her spot in the center of the room. She was technically everywhere. At any moment, she could peer into someone’s private quarters, correct - or destabilize, if she became unhinged - the failings of any system or information present on the *Stellar Flare*, or blast them off to a random jump point or other lockable energy signature.

It was a lot of pressure. She never properly got used to it, no matter how many times they recycled her.

She debated if she should ever tell Ruth she’d briefly hijacked her simulation. She decided against it. It didn’t matter either way: she seemed troubled, but capable. That was all Stell wanted from her.

She followed Ruth around the room with her sensors, slowly rotating, as she greeted humans, cousin species, and everything along the length of the opposite side of the scale. She failed and succeeded in intervals in applying appropriate social gestures, processing and filling in the translation gaps in her and everyone else’s communication devices, and pulling herself back from *about to throw up* to *probably not going to throw up*.

She was trying very hard. So Stell decided she liked her. She waited until Ruth had taken a breather to telepathically ping her. “You’re struggling a little. You feeling alright?”

Ruth startled, almost knocking a bowl off of a snack table next to her. She went into a hallway through a door. “I’m doing fine. This is Stell, yes? I noticed you were quiet after-”

“I like to let newcomers explore a bit without any pressure. I have a… Weighty presence, to some people. Anyway, I wanted to make a suggestion. The old hab officer did interviews with the others when she first got on-board.”

“Isn’t that usually done a bit later?”

“There’s no timeline for it. I feel it might help you get settled in. Before you protest and claim being perfectly at ease, some of them might need it, too.” In fact, the majority of the crew. Stell had been handed quite the grab bag of misfits.

“I can try.” Ruth stopped hesitating, vital signs to posture to the way she breathed, when Stell mentioned the crew’s needs.

“I think you’ll do just fine. Welcome aboard the *Stellar Flare*, junior habitation officer Ruth Shaw. I promise none of us will bite… On purpose.”

1kk6bg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1kk6bg7/what_is_she_doing/,What is she doing?,"Well

My ""ex"" followed me recently and congratulated me on my new diploma. I put ""ex"" because she was actually just playing me the whole time while having another guy that she was dating for years. She still is dating him. She was just using me as her sex toy I guess while playing me along. Then she made me into a creep when she ended this and basically gave me trauma and a heartbreak lol. The worst thing is I was seeing her still at work because we work in the same office.

Going back, she followed me recently. I followed back, I guess without thinking. Then she texted me and the small talk was very bland and she was avoiding when I asked about her intentions or addressed that I'm just confused. She asked me about where I'm taking my gym information, probably because I'm very into it for years and I know everything. I was thinking if she wanted to just use me for this information again but wasn't sure. Made a small flirting joke specifically to see if that's what she wants too, she wasn't into it. In general it was an odd conversation. But then she said we can talk in person and we did have a coffee in like a quiet space for 15 minutes. It was still quite bland, just talking about life. Her asking me how I'm doing and shit.

The thing is that it makes me just confused. What can she want from me? Why did she decide to follow and text? She said ""because most of my friends follow you so I decided why not"". I feel like that's just a nonsense explanation lol. 

How to make myself stop being in this confuse zone and not think about her intentions? Should I just unfollow her and go away again? What can be her intentions?

I've always wanted a superautomatic, getting freshly ground esspresso with convenience was my goal. However after using it for a few weeks I'm not exactly happy. I've read about the break in period so I grabbed a bag of cheap coffee and used up around half of it pretty quickly. Set the temperature to the highest and turned down the grinder fineness to a 4. It did an okay job, obviously with low quality beans I didn't expect anything extraordinary.

However the other day I got some nice locally roasted beans from a friend that got me all excited. I expected to do some fine tuning, but I didn't expect it to take so many beans. I used up almost half a bag of fancy beans and it still doesn't taste quite right, my espresso comes out sour, a bit less with higher yield, and adjusted the fineness to 3, but still not quite enjoyable. Which made me think, will I always need to use a ridiculous amount of beans to tune my machine when I switch them up? Seems so expensive and wasteful. Would I be better off returning it and getting an aeropress? I can't afford a more expensive automatic at this time.",1,1746984346.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1kk636v,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1kk636v/guide_staying_safe_dating_overseas_as_a_single/,GUIDE : Staying Safe Dating Overseas As A Single Male.,"I’ve seen tons of posts in this sub from
dudes who are traveling around the world wanting to know how to stay safe dealing with women in foreign countries. I originally made this for my friends going to Colombia alone but this can be applied anywhere (even in “safe” countries) if anybody has any extra tips you could add it in the comments. 

* Stay at a Airbnb or hotel with 24 hour front desk security : this is very important because security in Colombia usually always gets guest ID’s and makes photo copies due to the recent drugging and security issues in Colombia. 

* If something feels off, trust your gut: If at any point you feel uncomfortable or something seems suspicious, don’t hesitate to remove yourself from the situation. A lot of guys who go to Colombia get scoped by entertaining women they really never even found attractive. Don’t invite a stranger over just because you dumb and horny. 

* Be cautious with online profiles: Not everyone you meet online will be who they say they are. Make sure the profiles are verified accounts (accounts verified by facial recognition) Some might be using photos that aren't their own, and others might have ulterior motives. Be careful of women for one or two pictures or pictures where you cannot see her face! Ask for video calls: If you're talking to someone on Tinder or other apps, ask for a video call before meeting in person. This helps ensure you're dealing with someone who matches their profile picture and avoids potential catfishing. Also screenshot the photos of her off the Tinder profile so you have actual images of what she looks like just in case things go awry. 

* Don’t share too much personal information: Be mindful of how much personal information you disclose before meeting someone. Don’t tell her where you’re staying exactly. I sometimes lie and say I’m staying in the closest neighborhood that’s next to mines.

* Preprep your home if you do have plans to invite women over : lock up anything of value (passports, extra phones, jewelry, money) in the hotel safe. Also if you have things such as laptops or tech make sure you hide that in places as well. Put your clothes up and pack in the suitcase and put in the closet. Use a hotel safe for valuables: Always lock up your passport, cash, and any other valuables in a hotel safe or a secure location. 

* Avoid carrying too much cash: Carry just enough cash for the day and use cards or mobile payments when possible.

* If you plan to engage with escorts or women of the night set clear expectations and boundaries: Make sure you both understand the terms and conditions of your meeting.

* Never deal with two women at once! Sorry to crush your threesome fantasies but this is usually how most men get set up. Also don’t allow her to bring anyone else with her on a date. No if’s, ands or buts. 

* Initial meetings should be in public places: Avoid inviting someone you meet on Tinder to your hotel or apartment right away. Instead, meet in well-populated, reputable locations like coffee shops or restaurants. 

* YOU Always choose the location : Remember you make the decisions in this ordeal and you’ll %100 make them likely will be the person who is paying for this date so you make the decisions on where to go. It’s best to choose a location that is close to your accommodations that you may have visited before so you’re familiar with your surroundings and people who work at there.

* Avoid isolated areas: When meeting anyone for the first time, steer clear of secluded spots. Always pick a place in a very touristy or popular area. 

* NEVER EVER GO TO HER HOME OR WHERE SHE IS STAYING! This a huge red flag that you must avoid. You don’t know anything about her or where she’s stays. She will walk you right into a danger zone where you are far from home and all alone and at the mercy of her and her team. This is an ultimate fuck no. 

* Use trusted transportation: Stick to using well-known ride-sharing services like Uber or local taxis through reputable apps. Make sure you always call the Uber as well so you know that a reputable and actual uber is picking you up and nobody that may be apart of the plot. You also can see where you are going and making sure the Uber is not going off the other. Avoid accepting rides from people who approach you in the street. Avoid unregistered taxis: These may be less safe, especially late at night.

* Initial meetings should be in public places: Avoid inviting someone you meet on Tinder to your hotel or apartment right away. Instead, meet in well-populated, reputable locations like coffee shops or restaurants. 

* Let someone know your whereabouts: Always tell a friend or family member where you’re going, who you’re meeting, and when you plan to return.
* Never leave your drink unattended: Whether you're at a bar or club, always keep your drink in sight. If you step away from the table, take it with you.

* Accept drinks only from trusted sources: Avoid accepting drinks from strangers or people you don't know well. If someone offers you a drink, watch it being prepared. If you can avoid drinking at your apartment. 

* Stay sober enough to make decisions: If you plan to drink, do so in moderation, as this will allow you to stay alert and aware of your surroundings.

* (OPTIONAL) Ask to check her purse before entering your apartment : If she doesn’t have anything to hide this will not be an issue. Most of these women who drug men carry small bottles that look like eye drops that contain the scopolamine drug. I wrote this with Colombia in mind. 

TIP: If you can and willing to spend the money book a cheap hotel room that is close to your accommodations (in safe area) so if you do plan on running through women atleast you can bring them to a place where nothing of value is in. My last trip to Cartagena I lucked up and had two apartments in the same building and used one for actually sleeping in and one for bringing women.

TIP : Make sure your phone has face recognition on for everything including apps (credit card, banks) A lot of these criminals are trying to learn your phone password so they can break into your personal accounts. Use face recognition so even if a situation happens where your phone does get stolen having face recognition will make it extremely difficult to hack your accounts. 

By staying vigilant and exercising common sense, you can minimize the risks and make the most of your trips. ",12,1746983807.0,thepassportbros,3,0.93,False

1kk61or,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kk61or/can_the_delonghi_dcm900_coffee_maker_deliver/,Can the DeLonghi DCM900 Coffee Maker Deliver Perfect Brews? Honest Review Inside!,"Testing out the De'Longhi DCM900 10-Cup Coffee Maker has been a mix of discovery and brewing delight. The stainless steel design immediately impressed me with its sleek brushed aluminum finish, adding a modern look to my kitchen counter. Given its reputation and features, I was eager to see if this coffee maker could hold up to its promises of convenience and quality. 

**Design and Build Quality**

The brushed aluminum exterior was the first thing that caught my eye. It’s not just for aesthetics; the material feels durable and stain-resistant, which is a big deal for someone like me, who isn't known for the tidiest coffee-making rituals. It’s relatively compact, measuring 15.59 x 14.13 x 7.4 inches, so it fit just right alongside my other kitchen appliances. The ergonomically designed handle of the carafe deserves mention—it’s genuinely comfortable to hold, even for less graceful coffee drinkers like myself.

**Performance and Brewing Capacity**

I've tested a fair number of coffee makers, and the promise of brewing 10 cups in just 6 minutes left me skeptical—but this machine delivered. It consistently brewed aromatic coffee without compromising on strength or taste. The reusable gold-tone filter feels sturdy and keeps even fine grounds out of my coffee—a feature that hits home for anyone as picky about texture as I am when it comes to their morning cup.  

[Check De'Longhi DCM900 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0006l9vee/)

**Features that Caught My Attention**

This coffee maker comes with thoughtful additions like an illuminated toggle switch, which makes operating the appliance simple, even on groggy mornings. The two-hour automatic shut-off is essential for anyone who, like me, has a tendency to leave appliances running. I also found the decalcification warning light quite handy—maintenance reminders are a lifesaver. Another feature I quickly grew to love was the Pause and Serve function. It's a game-changer for impatient coffee drinkers; you can sneak a cup mid-brew without a major coffee-spill incident.

**Advantages**

- Brews 10 cups in 6 minutes—saves time during busy mornings.  
- Gold-tone reusable filter keeps grounds out and minimizes waste.  
- Ergonomically designed carafe with a stain-resistant exterior.  
- Pause and Serve function for mid-brew convenience.

**Areas of Concern**

- The carafe lid felt a bit flimsy to me; it might not be the most durable part of the machine.  
- At 15 pounds, it’s surprisingly heavier than its size suggests, making it harder to move around.  
- Somewhat noisy during the brewing cycle—might not suit light sleepers.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing the De'Longhi DCM900 to its competitors like the Breville Precision Brewer or the Cuisinart DCC-3200, I noticed the DCM900 prioritizes speed over customization. While the Breville caters to gourmet coffee lovers with its multiple brew strength options, this unit keeps things simple, focusing on reliability and efficacy. The Cuisinart offers Wi-Fi capability and a more refined control panel, but lacks the sturdy build that the brushed metal exterior of this coffee maker brings. However, both competitors operate notably quieter than the DCM900, a point worth noting for users who prioritize noise levels.

**Quality for Price**

Judging the price-to-quality ratio, this coffee maker holds its ground well. Its durable materials combined with functional features like the dual heating system and the decalcification warning light help validate its cost. While it lacks the sophistication of some upscale machines, its focus on essentials and simplicity ensures excellent value for its category. If high-end functionality isn’t something you’re after, this coffee maker represents a solid investment.

1kk5yxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kk5yxz/explore_the_euhomy_nugget_ice_maker_review_is_it/,Explore the EUHOMY Nugget Ice Maker Review Is It Worth the Hype?,"The EUHOMY IM-12S-HM Nugget Ice Maker has been a notable addition to my countertop for the past couple of weeks, and it’s safe to say it’s been a game-changer for my beverage habits. This sleek and compact device boasts efficient ice production, portability, and a handy auto-cleaning feature, making it a strong contender for anyone looking to up their ice game at home, camping trips, or even at a party. While it does an excellent job overall, no product is perfect, and there are some quirks worth mentioning as well.

**Eye-Catching Design and Portability**  
One aspect that stands out about this nugget ice maker is its minimalist design. The black exterior and compact size (measuring 9.45” x 11.61” x 12.99”) fit comfortably on any countertop without dominating the space. Its lightweight build and sturdy handle make it super easy to carry around, whether it's from the kitchen to the backyard or packed up for an RV road trip. The ice scoop holder integrated on the back is one of those little details that you didn’t realize you needed until you have it. A transparent top cover provides a clear view of the ice-making process, which, oddly enough, I’ve found oddly satisfying to watch.  

[Check EUHOMY IM-12S-HM price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0c32sgkmj/)  

**Quick and Efficient Ice Production**  
What has truly made me a fan of this device is its ability to churn out nugget ice in as little as six minutes. It’s quick, reliable, and produces up to 34 pounds of soft, chewy ice per day. Whether you’re a fan of iced coffee, smoothies, or snacking on ice (raising my hand here), this machine has you covered. Its 1.2-quart water tank and 1.8-pound removable basket easily meet daily needs without constant refills, which has been a major convenience factor during those scorching afternoons.  

**Advantages**  
- Compact and portable, with a sleek aesthetic.  
- Effortless nugget ice production within six minutes.  
- Easy monitoring through its transparent lid.  

**Self-Cleaning Smart Features**  
What really sets this ice maker apart is its smart functionality. The device comes equipped with “ICE FULL” and “ADD WATER” indicators, which prevent overflows or interruptions due to a dry tank. A self-cleaning mode activates with a press of the “Ice/Clean” button, and I can't emphasize enough how valuable that feature is. With past appliances, I’ve had to scrub surfaces manually—this, on the other hand, feels like the future of kitchen appliances.  

**Downsides**  
- Produces some residual noise, though it remains below 50 dB.  
- Requires occasional manual draining after extended use.  
- Limited capacity for larger, high-demand gatherings.  

**Energy Efficiency and Noise**  
Considering it runs quietly (under 50 dB) and only consumes approximately three kWh per day, it’s a fantastic match for working environments where peace is prized. I tested this in my office while hosting coworkers during meetings, and it blended in seamlessly, letting us focus on work without the distracting hum. The energy efficiency has also been a nice bonus for my utility bills.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Brands like GE Profile and Opal have similar nugget ice makers on the market. While GE’s models often come with Wi-Fi connectivity for app-based control, EUHOMY keeps it simple, and therein lies its charm—it caters to those of us who’d rather avoid navigating yet another app. The Opal is heavier and larger, making portability less of a priority, while this model nails the balance between functionality and ease of use. However, the EUHOMY could stand to bolster its water tank capacity to rival some of these options.  

**Value for Money**  
Given its features like nugget ice within minutes, auto-cleaning, and portability, this machine delivers an incredible bang for the buck. Other machines with similar features often come with a higher price tag, but this strikes a good balance between cost and utility. For frequent entertainers, ice-upgrade fanatics, or campers, the financial value this appliance brings makes it absolutely worth considering.

1kk5yid,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kk5yid,"Finally got to experience Now & Then in Nashville, and it did not disappoint!","If you guys haven't heard about Now & Then, I wouldn't be too surprised. They are currently doing a residency at Sean Brock's restaurant Audrey in Nashville. It's a husband and wife that handle everything. They are set to open a brick and mortar down the road this year, however. 

The way it currently sits, they are open 4 days for a few hours before the actual bar opens up, and the place is very Nashville. All vintage analog audio gear with a rotation of records playing, they even have a pair of studio monitors that were used on a Highwaymen album. Pretty rad, even if you aren't into that sort of thing. 

The coffee is unbelievable. Their attention to detail is immaculate. All top-tier beans. They are roasting some of their own, but their multi-roaster approach is always changing weekly as well. They swear by the pulsar for all pourover, which I thought was neat. Now I want one. 

I had a Panamanian Gesha for the first time. It took me an hour and a half to get through it as we chatted about recipes and roasters and water and everything in-between. Certainly more of an experience than it is about just getting a cup of expensive coffee. 

Anyways, if anyone here is ever in Nashville, you would be making a big mistake not coming by here and trying some coffee. The coffee and conversation is top notch, as is the music. Just beware, they have 10 seats at the bar, and don't take reservations. I came on a Friday around noon and waited maybe 3 minutes before being sat. All around an incredible experience that I wouldn't trade for anything! ",22,1746983472.0,pourover,14,1.0,False

1kk5xaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1kk5xaa/how_to_handle_a_situation_where_it_seems_like_i/,"How to handle a situation where it seems like I have to write a bad review as a guest. Sorry for epic post, I have been a host for 15 years but only a guest 4 times.","Hi, well I never thought I would be on this Reddit for a question about leaving a guest review after 15 years of being a host of multiple properties on Vrbo and Airbnb. I very, very rarely traveling myself, and I had to go to my nieces graduation in Pittsburgh. 

I had an odd experience and I’m not sure how to handle it because I never had problems as a guest before, and I only have my experience as a host with one three star review and the rest only four and five star reviews. 

First of all, I booked an Airbnb room in a female hosted home. I only mention this because she had a house rule that she did not accept male guests any longer. I am a female 55 years old with a disability so I walk with a cane.

She accepted my booking request and then I actually extended it by three days so I could spend time with my niece after the graduation. I mentioned in these first two communications that I was looking forward to spending time with my 85-year-old mother and my niece who is 23 and possibly having them stop by for coffee or dinner one night.

Then I ended up with a health complication a day before I was supposed to fly, and I reached out to her to let her know that I was going to possibly change my flight to a later, one on the same day. The difference in arrival time was that I originally was going to arrive at 7 PM and I might arrive at 11 PM or maybe if the flight was late at 12 midnight. She immediately replied it would be better for me if you arrived earlier.

I replied right away that it would be better for me to arrive earlier, but I couldn’t do that since I was literally in the hospital and had to change my flight to a later time in order to make the flight. Just for a little background, I had to reach out to her because her instructions for access just said to contact her. So I never heard back from her    for an entire day despite several messages that were polite, but also explaining that I really needed to hear back from her in order to rebook my flight.

At that point, I contacted Airbnb support. They said they were trying to reach the host. They told me she wasn’t responding to them then the day that I was supposed to travel originally I did hear back from the host. I don’t know it may be 6 AM. And I was supposed to fly at 10:30 AM so at that point I was able to call and change my flight at 8:30 in the morning on the same day of my flight. Needless to say there was a price difference that I had to pay. I did get the flight insurance travel insurance so it’s possible that I will get that refunded because my doctor did write a note.

But all of this was very stressful for me because I was on the phone with Airbnb like lying in the hospital room. And very very stressed out about whether I had a place to stay nearby to my niece’s graduation, which happened to be on the same weekend as a huge, huge marathon event in Pittsburgh so everything was booked out there.

Anyway, what would happen was I flew in to Pittsburgh on the same flight that I would’ve taken but just the next day. So she told me that she would either be there or she would leave the key under the mat. I got there actually a little bit earlier than I thought I think around 6 PM and the host met me and gave me a key just on the little ring and she showed me the room. It was actually a third floor walk up and to get up to the front of her house was three flights of stairs.

Her listing did not say that it was going to be the third floor. In our house from the pictures didn’t even look like it had a third story but I mean, I didn’t say anything about that. I was just so happy to be in the right place that the right time to be with my family.

I was very tired and just briefly went upstairs and put my makeup on and changed and then went to a family dinner. At that point, I didn’t have any concerns as I mentioned. I’m not a guest very much at all so my expectations were pretty low. The house was renovated the way that it was in the pictures, but it was cluttered with obviously a lot of her personal stuff that wasn’t shown it wasn’t immaculately clean or anything because she has two cats, but the room and sheets were clean and the common area surfaces were clean and you know it was fine.

I came back and went directly to bed. In the morning I got up and she was there. It was odd from that point on because the first thing I think she said to me maybe after I said good morning was “I’m single again.” Which was just an odd thing to say to someone that you just met I thought. Then, she couldn’t find the coffee maker that I guess was for Guest so she offered to let me use her little Italian coffee maker and coffee because I was asking her what type of coffee I needed to order for the coffee maker that she couldn’t find so by the way, I bought her an entire container of that Italian coffee to replace the small amount that I used over the six days that I was there.

From that point on it seemed like she might be having a personal crisis of some kind. Because she told me so much stuff about her personal life that was just inappropriate and I felt like I was her therapist or something in particular she went on and on about her sex life and how she was 40 now and wanted to get married and have kids. And she also went on and on about how she’s unemployed now which was not what it said in the listing, it said that she was employed, but she worked at home. And she repeatedly mentioned difficulties with her relationship with her parents who I gather are overbearing and wealthy or something.

In retrospect, I don’t know what I could’ve done actually but in retrospect it was very odd and I also have a brain injury myself and I’m a 55-year-old single woman so you know I was trying to be kind and just I don’t know of course, respectful and considerate of my host, so I just let her talk, of course in her own house. She also mentioned having numerous problems with various Airbnb guests over the time she was hosting.

But this in retrospect was very odd. For example, she told me all about dating her new boyfriend (20 years younger, Brazilian, and he wasn’t returning her texts, which seem to be causing her some distress , and she was resorting to using tarot cards to decide whether to try texting him ) and her last boyfriend (from Mexico, and apparently she dated him for two years and she said that he had “no money and no papers so it would never have worked out“ and that she had sex/dated one of her Airbnb Guests prior. 

To be honest, maybe that happens, but it never occurred to me that it did because I’ve been a host for 15 years and I certainly never even came close to any kind of inappropriate behavior with my own guests…

I was so focused on my family event and very very stressed because I have health problems, that I didn’t really consider how unbalanced all of this was at the time. I was just sympathetic to her and trying to be kind because she seemed like she was very lonely and had very few friends. I am such a nice person that I actually went to Whole Foods after asking her if she would like me to make dinner for her, and I didn’t have any plans with my family one night so I cooked her a gourmet meal and did all the cleanup from it.

I probably should’ve just stayed away from her completely or something but anyway as a thank you for that she took me on like a 20 minute tour of the view from a high hill in Pittsburgh of the city. It was nice of her, but I couldn’t do very much with that because I walk with a cane and I can’t walk very far so it was a quick trip.

Her behavior seemed to really change several days into the trip when she mentioned she had a job interview to prepare for and again this boyfriend who is 20 years younger I wasn’t texting her back and like maybe he was ghosting her. I don’t know. At this point I should mention that although she renovated the house beautifully, the first flight of stairs and the hallway in her bedroom level, which was the second floor were the most creaky floors I’ve ever experienced. It literally sounded like a movie how creaky they were. And since I had to go up past her bedroom to go to the third floor, it was impossible for me not to make noise doing so.

Again, I never brought this up with her at the time. The only reason that sound came up later in my trip is that at four in the morning, the second to last night that I was there and then at four in the morning on my last night there there was a lot of noise coming from downstairs, which is an adult I assumed was her having a boyfriend at some kind over at the house. I was a little bit, surprised that she did that because she didn’t take male guests and so and I didn’t have a lock on my door so I was just like a little bit uncomfortable and also it woke me up. 

All of this was happening and then on the second and last night of my trip, I was gonna have dinner with my niece just the two of us alone and I told my host that I would like to have my niece over for dinner at the house since it was going to be quiet as opposed to a restaurant. And I am a very good cook and I had just made my host dinner and cleaned it up completely so I didn’t anticipate having any problems with just letting her know that this was going to happen, but she immediately responded back to me and said that she doesn’t allow that and that it’s in her house rules.

I was absolutely certain when she said that that that was not true but I literally had to pick up my niece within like 15 minutes so I just let it go and took my niece out to a nice sushi restaurant. But the next day I called Airbnb to ask them if she really had that rule because I was certain that I had mentioned my intention to do that to her and she hadn’t said it was against her rules when I booked, and I didn’t see that role when I booked The representative said that he looked back at when I booked it and that the role was not present then, and he said that I wasn’t going to be in trouble for doing that thing or something, but I said that actually I hadn’t done the thing i.e. having my niece over for dinner because I didn’t want to put my niece in the situation where my host was being hostile or weird.

It was just another problem with my host. An Airbnb offered me another place to stay, but the places they offered because everything was booked out were not appropriate. So I decided to stay, but I did call my host and briefly have a chat with her where I said that I was disappointed that she had changed this rule and that first of all she did didn’t tell me about changing the rule and then she applied it to me, even though I had booked her place before she had the rule. And then I said you know that it makes me uncomfortable that she did that and that Airbnb and offered me another place and I just wanted to make sure that we were OK for me to stay another night. She said yes of course it’s OK.

When I got back to the Airbnb that night after being away for 12 hours, she was basically up in her room in office kind of on the second floor kind of going back-and-forth and slamming the doors. That was a new thing for her to do so, of course it made me uncomfortable And I went to bed promptly but again I got woken up at four in the morning by loud noises coming from her bedroom so at four in the morning, I just decided that I had to leave. I couldn’t wait until the eight in the morning when her quiet hours ended to get ready because I just wanted to get out of there and did not want to interact with her anymore.

So I got everything packed made coffee breakfast. I followed her house rules to get the sheets down to the laundry room, threw away all of my trash in the main trashcan. Then I had to bring my luggage down, with a cane on these stairs, which, obviously as I mentioned before or like the loudest stairs I’ve ever heard. So it was impossible to do that fully quietly, but I did the best I could then I left her key on the mantle with like a keychain that I had added so that I wouldn’t lose it because it was so small without having anything attached to it. I took pictures of the room, pictures of the key, and a video of the stair noise. 

And then at about 7:30 in the morning, I went to a coffee shop with all of my luggage. I met my niece for coffee at 11 AM. At about 8 AM the host messaged me and said that I hadn’t left the key and I simply replied. Yes I did and put put the message with the picture of where the key was left. 

Then she sent a message saying that her very expensive All Clad pans that I had used to make her dinner with were damaged and she was trying to get Airbnb to pay for them to be replaced. She sent a photo of pans that were clearly not damaged at all. It was so weird and honestly at this point I had spent maybe 10 hours of the week that I wanted to spend with my family at basically a family reunion for my nieces graduation dealing with problems with my Airbnb booking and host.

I was very frustrated at that point. And I said to her in the message when she told me she was making a request for the pans to be replaced that they weren’t damaged at all, and that she was not in a place in her life where she should be hosting an Airbnb. When Airbnb called me, I told him that I would send a picture of her pans to the company that manufactures them and that they would we can email me back and answer as to whether they were damaged and I was certain they would say they were not damaged.

Just that I don’t know 10 to 14 hours that I have spent dealing with the hosts problems, personal problems mostly and calling Airbnb because I’ve never had a problem before as a guest, really took a lot of time out of my week. And I really feel angry about that part of it.

She just wrote me a review and I haven’t written her review but what I was wondering was: of all these things that happened? What do you all think were the most worthy of mentioning in the review? Also, I guess she’s going to retaliate against me by writing a terrible review and that kind of sucks because I rarely travel so I only have three reviews right now, but they’re all five stars. I would hate to not be able to use Airbnb in the future because of a terrible or inaccurate review.

One thing that I noticed pertaining to the review situation is that when I called her about the fact that I was disappointed that she was not allowing me to have my niece come over for a simple dinner. She mentioned that I tried to come at midnight to arrive at her house. And I said I didn’t try to come. I asked you if that would work for you and you didn’t respond and that cost me more money because I had to book my new flight the same day that I canceled the first one. It was kind of like that she was still actually mad at me for asking to change my arrival time when she was the one that just didn’t respond which to me clearly seems like she probably wanted me to cancel at that point when I was trying to find out about the flight time arrival stuff.

She was still hanging onto like me even asking that as being like so incredibly inappropriate as a guest. And I was thinking as a host of the many times that I met Guests late because they were arriving because of a late flight or they arrived at 1 AM and they told me that they were arriving at 1 AM and I said that was fine in particular remember meeting a young family traveling with a baby in a carriage who came from the island nation of Fiji and they arrived at one in the morning and they had no milk for their baby and they had arrived with no milk for their baby so of course as a caring host I drove the Dad to get milk at the nearby grocery store and I was happy to do it because I like helping people.

I really don’t think people who do not like helping people actually make good hosts. It seemed she obviously resented everything she had to do for me as being her guest, which honestly wasn’t very much to do. Up until the point that things got truly truly weird one of the things I thought about was that if it was my house is that if  I was going to be a host there I would’ve fixed the stairs and it was such a nice house that if she had wanted to do so and be an excellent host, she could probably charge three times which she was charging me. Then after everything got really weird and I was waiting in that coffee shop for my niece, I looked up whether she needed to be licensed as a rental in Pittsburgh and found out that yes indeed all Pittsburgh rentals are required to be licensed and of course she’s not licensed. 

My properties are licensed according to the laws here in Denver. And I never got less than a three star review and I only got one three star review out of hundreds of reviews. So I was frankly unprepared for the difficulties that I encountered in this day and maybe I could’ve handled it better but I don’t know how.. if you have any thoughts on how I should handle the review situation because that’s the last thing left other than documenting that her pan wasn’t damaged, please reply to this post.

We've stayed at a handful of all inclusive and this was definitely one of our better experiences. I'd seen some mixed reviews before our trip so I wanted to share our experience for anyone who might be considering it. 

Start with the cons
*The rooms have great AC, but the other indoor common areas (including restaurants) have poor air circulation and are quite stuffy. We ate outside for most of our meals so the breeze was nice, but indoors was uncomfortable. 
*The check in experience was subpar from what I would expect from this level of resort. We stood around for 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, no cool towels, no drink offered. Once a staff member helped us it was quick but not how we wanted to be welcomed. 
*The only options for breakfast were a buffet or room service. Not the worst thing in the world, but would have appreciated an a la carte breakfast outside of room service. 

Now for the pros
*Cabanas are super reasonable to rent. We got one by the pool and it included full day waiter service for drinks and food. 
*Great spa. Try the hydracircuit.
*The food was pretty good, very big portions for an all inclusive. We enjoyed the French restaurant the most. 
*Absolutely loved the on property coffee shop. Got an iced latte every morning. 
*Gorgeous scenery and views. It's technically two resorts that share the property (St James and Wild Orchid) and it's situated on the coast with some smaller lagoons which were great for lounging and you could see the mountains. 
*We never had issues getting chairs at either the pool or beach. 
*They have a virtual cocktail menu which we appreciate because it gave us a bunch of ideas of drinks to try. They also offer a bunch of mocktails. 

Sure the property could use some touch ups, but for the price it's an incredible value. The frozen drinks weren't super boozy, but the cocktails packed a punch (we enjoyed mojitos and caipriahnas). We never had to wait for a table at any of the restaurants and the food came out pretty quick. The entertainment was also great, a lot of talented musicians each night. 

We stayed in an ocean view junior suite and it was great. We thought about upgrading to preferred but ended up not doing it and don't regret it. Maybe if it's during a busier time it would be useful but we had no issues.

    *   **Other Encounters:**
        *   Met **David Bond** in Japan; went to a nightclub where Bond told girls Daniel was gay. Daniel found Bond's behavior cringey.

    *   **Tech Review Channel:** Focused more on tech reviews for his second channel (Expert Review Zone), finding some success with Elden Ring, Diablo 4, and Steam Deck videos. This provided a more stable, less drama-filled income for a time.
    *   **Financial Woes:**
        *   Lost significant money in stock market investments (meme stocks like BINGO, NEO, Microvision), halving his inheritance money.
        *   Tax penalties from HMRC became a major issue, leading to a large debt to his mother (initially £11,000).

        *   Lived in a condo in Bangkok (£200/month).

    *   **Living in Bangkok:** Lived in a condo with **Ty GF**.

    *   **Language School:** Attended Thai language school for 4 months (to get an education visa). Found it boring towards the end. Met a British girl there.
    *   **YouTube Decline:** Main channel (""Hiding in My Room"") continued to decline (""dead channel""). Gaming channel views also declined as game trends faded. Started a third channel (""Abroad in Thailand"") with a new, positive strategy.
    *   **Brief Trip to Japan (Osaka/Himeji):**
        *   Stayed in ""slum hotels"" and a ""horrid"" guesthouse near Himeji (£700 for 3 months - ""old building, noisy, thin paper thin wall""). Felt depressed.
        *   Met a Korean woman from a dating app; had unsatisfactory sex, she gave him ""dick cheese."" An old Japanese man annoyed him.
        *   **Blood Bucket** met him once to help sell a camera. A meetup with **Sunny** failed.

    *   **Return to Thailand & Relationship Dynamics:**
        *   Returned to Thailand. **Ty GF** visited Japan with Daniel (October, expensive trip - $1700 total, he paid most). He found it emotionally weird revisiting places he went with **Chihiro** and other exes.
        *   **Ty GF** announced plans to move to the USA (Washington D.C.) in March 2024 to work (sponsored by uncle/aunt). Daniel felt lonely and this threw his plans into disarray.
    *   **Financial Situation:** Struggled with inconsistent YouTube earnings (significant drop in Jan 2024). Significant tax debt to HMRC (initially £14,000, paid down with his mother's help, now owes her between £5,500-£11,500 depending on the report).

**V. Current Saga: ""Final"" Japan Tour, UK Interlude, & Uncertain Future (2024, Age 35)**

*   **A. Return to Japan (March - May 2024): Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Tokyo**
    *   **Living Situation & Complaints:**
        *   Stayed in a cheap guest house in Amagasaki, Osaka. Immediately disliked it due to a noisy American roommate (**John/Tom**, an English teacher), other noisy roommates (Sri Lankan/Indian/Armenian guy), thin walls, and shared facilities.
        *   Later moved to a £700/week apartment in Tokyo near Disneyland. Initially happy with the peace but found Tokyo crowded and irritating.
    *   **Content & YouTube:**
        *   Conducted daily 10-hour IRL walking streams due to inability to stream comfortably in the guest house.
        *   Streams initially did well (150-200 viewers, sometimes 300+), then viewership declined.
        *   Experienced frequent demonetization (yellow icon) of streams.
        *   A YouTube viewer count bug caused major distress, making him believe his channel was dead before realizing it was a glitch.
        *   Expressed deep boredom with making videos and YouTube in general. Main channel felt ""dead."" His spirit for outdoor streaming felt ""broken.""
    *   **Stalking Incident & Police Involvement:**
        *   Revisited old neighborhoods from his marriage with **Chihiro**.
        *   Received DMs from a troll named ""Chosen"" and saw Reddit posts suggesting **Chihiro** was building a legal case against him for stalking and other past ""crimes"" (uncensored love doll video, SD card content), allegedly involving her brother-in-law (a policeman).
        *   Panicked, fled the guest house in the middle of the night, and booked into the Apple Hotel in Umeda.
        *   During his ""escape"" stream, a Reddit user (""Stalker"") posted photos of Daniel, claiming to be following him, including a zoomed-in photo of him checking into the Apple Hotel. Daniel was visibly spooked.
        *   **Chihiro** reported him to the police for stalking (he denied it, saying he was just in the old neighborhood). Daniel was taken to the police station, interrogated for hours, and warned. This caused significant stress but also boosted views.
        *   His mother contacted **Chihiro**, who allegedly told his mom it was all trolls and there was no case. Daniel felt relief but remained wary.
        *   Consulted a lawyer for £70 to discuss potential legal issues.
    *   **Social Interactions & Meetups:**
        *   **Blood Bucket** (Japanese Goth friend, whom he calls ""mommy"" or ""Japanese mum""): Multiple streams, including a sleepover at her house. He believes this caused issues with his girlfriend (**Ty GF**) and **Blood Bucket's** potential interest in him. She tweeted about him being an ""isoro"" (freeloader).
        *   **Sunny** (British JET program viewer): Multiple popular streams (yakiniku, karaoke, park drinking). Views peaked during these interactions. A planned ""threesome sleepover"" with **Blood Bucket** was effectively cancelled due to **Ty GF's** objections and subsequent awkwardness.
        *   **Chris Broad & CDawgVA (Connor) ""Sniping"":** Successfully ""sniped"" them during their charity cycle stream in Osaka. Walked past **Chris Broad**. Approached **Connor** and Pete (Chris's cameraman), asked **Connor** to tell him to ""F off,"" which **Connor** did humorously. Daniel was highly agitated and excited by this encounter. He feels **Chris Broad** is an ""enemy"" and was jealous of his success.
        *   **Hong Kong Guy (Casey/KC):** Had a Yaki Niku stream. Low views, copyright issues with the VOD. Daniel paid, felt it was a mistake, and found **Casey** too happy beating him at arcade games. Daniel felt no ""beef"" but believed viewers tried to stir trouble. He grows suspicious **Casey** is stringing him along or in on a ""plot"" for later meetups.
        *   **""Meaningless Rubbish"" (Stream Sniper):** Awkward and confrontational encounters. Daniel found him annoying. Meaningless later made YouTube videos complaining about Daniel.
        *   **Failed Meetups:** Planned meetups with a gay guy, an English guest house guy from 2013, a Japanese woman viewer, and **Shin** (Finnish girl) all fell through or were non-committal. **Shin** backed out allegedly due to her Discord members advising against it.
    *   **Bar Hopping Arc (Osaka):**
        *   Multiple drunken nights out, often alone or with a Canadian viewer (**Canadian guy**).
        *   Visited ""Drunken Clam"" (Family Guy themed karaoke bar, mostly ""bogan"" Australians, ""sausage fest""), Karma Sutra Karaoke Bar, and ""The Hub"" pub in Umeda.
        *   Encounters with French girls (one ""fondles"" him), an American guy (**Nick**), New Zealand guys, and a Japanese guy who looked/sounded like ""Noa.""
        *   Frequently missed the last train, walked long distances (5km), peed under Yodogawa bridge.
        *   Found Japanese girls ""boring"" and ""timid"" compared to ""fun"" and ""outgoing"" Western/European girls. Realized why **Chris Broad** and Joey don't date Japanese women. Felt he had ""no rizz.""
    *   **Day Trips & Incidents:**
        *   **Kyoto:** Walked/cycled 52km. Stated purpose was to ""steal"" hotel shampoo and toothpaste. Found Nijo Castle and Imperial Palace grounds boring, refused to pay entry fees. Ate at Kura Sushi (found ""awful"") and Burger King. A van driver yelled at him for his cycling.
        *   **Nara:** Found it boring. Fed deer. Restaurant he wanted to visit was closed. Had difficulty at Sushiro. Embarked on a ""walk back to Osaka"" over/around mountains, got spooked by darkness. Took a train from Eoma station after a run to catch it.
    *   **Food Incidents:** Ate expired tuna sushi (gray, tangy, metallic). Ate a McDonald's Conan special ""Tatsuta"" burger (found weird). Bought a discounted Yaki Tori and ""corroke"" bento (Yaki Tori cold, croquette bland).
    *   **Health & Mood:** Constant complaints about feet hurting, back pain, knee pain, hip joint pain (attributes to Chlamydia arthritis). Pimples. Developed hay fever in Japan. Increasingly negative, bored, frustrated with Japan, its people (spitting, rudeness, ""chavs,"" delinquents), and weather. Felt ""burnt out"" from IRL streaming. Expressed disillusionment, feeling Japan had declined or his ""honeymoon phase"" was long over. Declared it his ""final stream in Japan"" for a long time.
    *   **Ty GF's Visit:** **Ty GF** was due to arrive in Tokyo at the end of May for a 2-week trip (Nagano, Osaka, Tokyo). Daniel booked a £500/night Ryokan in Nagano (same one **Chris Broad** stayed at).

*   **B. Return to UK & ""New Life"" Disaster (June 2024 - Present):**
    *   **Motivation:** Returned to the UK in early June for his sister's wedding (£30-40k cost to her). Planned to live with his mother in Kent to save money, pay off debt, and focus on his gaming/tech YouTube channel.
    *   **New Rented House (£900/month):** Moved into a new house.
        *   Complained bitterly about the cold, stating he spends 90% of his life in his ""tiny little square box room"" office to conserve heat. The house is poorly insulated (EPC rating F or G).
        *   Discovered a ""creepy"" small door in an upstairs room leading to a dusty space with a mysterious box he's afraid to open. The door opens and slams due to air pressure changes.
    *   **IKEA Furniture Assembly Nightmare:**
        *   Bought a bed (£180) and two bedside tables.
        *   Spent nearly 3 hours assembling the bed, struggling immensely, expressing frustration with IKEA's design (""stupid,"" ""idiots""), and needing tools he didn't have (hammer, electric screwdriver). The bed ended up creaky with one corner not properly assembled.
        *   Further struggles with assembling one bedside table, snapping a part, and dealing with difficult screws and pegs. The process involved loud hammering late at night.
    *   **Car Purchase (Peugeot e-208 Electric):**
        *   Bought a 2-year-old Peugeot e-208 for £13,000.
        *   Financed it with a £4,000 credit card deposit, monthly payments of £190, plus £110-£120/month for insurance. Total cost over 4 years if he keeps it will be ~£18,000-£19,000.
        *   Scratched the wing mirror on the first day by driving into a bush while panicking on a narrow road.
        *   Bought numerous car accessories: floor mats, protective vinyl tape, dash cam, air freshener, snow foam, and a pressure washer.
    *   **Pressure Washer Fiasco:** Failed to get the £150 Bosch pressure washer to work (couldn't get it to suck water from a bucket). His mom then revealed they already had a hosepipe. He decided to return the pressure washer and associated accessories, frustrated by the waste of time and money.
    *   **Driving Anxiety:** Expressed anxiety about driving, parking (especially reversing on his steep, narrow driveway), and potential costs.
    *   **Financial Crisis Deepens:**
        *   Debt balloons to approximately £17,000 (£6,500 credit card, £9,800-£11,500 owed to his mom, £500 overdraft).
        *   YouTube income remained low (around £870 expected for the current month).
        *   His stock investments were down ~£9,700 overall from their peak, though he's made some recent gains.
        *   Felt immense pressure to pay off debts, especially the credit card before the 0% interest period ends.
    *   **Job Hunt:**
        *   Attended a job interview (details vague, ""serving customers and making tea""). He was worried they would Google him. Outcome pending.
        *   Applied for a Domino's delivery driver position in Cranbrook (half-hour drive away) during a stream.
        *   Considered Uber Eats but was put off by the high cost of specialized insurance (~£3,200/year) and calculated the profit margins to be poor compared to a minimum wage job.
    *   **Relationship with Sunny:** **Sunny** was due to visit after the 9th of the month. He planned to pick her up in his new car. Communication was strained; **Sunny** didn't message him much when he was streaming, possibly because he ""trash talked her"" previously and she felt his viewers disliked her. He hoped the bed was strong enough for ""two people.""
    *   **Emotional & Physical State:**
        *   Frequently described his new life as a ""disaster.""
        *   Expressed feelings of being ""so down,"" stressed, overwhelmed by debt, and regretful of purchases.
        *   Suffered from a persistent cough (over a month).

        *   Experienced anger and frustration, leading him to punch his door (breaking it) after buying the car.
        *   A cooking attempt (pasta) led to a kitchen filled with smoke/steam and a ""disgusting"" meal that made him ""actually crying.""
        *   Felt lonely but looked forward to **Sunny's** visits.
    *   **Streaming Issues & Hateful Content:** Regularly endured a barrage of offensive, racist, and hateful text-to-speech donations during his streams. He sometimes read them, sometimes muted them, and acknowledged they risked his channel's monetization or could lead to bans. His streams often documented his struggles and frustrations in real-time.

*   **C. Future Plans (As of Mid-2024):**
    *   Stay in the UK for an extended period (possibly until early 2025) to save money, pay off debt, and focus on his gaming/tech YouTube channel.

    *   **Ty GF** will be in the US; he doesn't want to go there (expensive, boring, scary).

**VI. Recurring Brutal, Interesting, Negative, and Compelling Themes Throughout Daniel's Life:**

Expresses deep loneliness and feelings of being an ""incel"" despite often pushing people away or sabotaging connections.

*   **Impulsivity & Severe Regret:** Makes impulsive decisions regarding travel, purchases, relationships, and content creation, often followed by intense regret and negative financial or personal consequences.
*   **Sense of Wasted Potential & Time:** Particularly vocal about feeling he wasted 15 years of his life focused on Japan, which ultimately led to ""nowhere"" and profound bitterness.
*   **Difficult & Unstable Living Situations:** Frequently complains about noisy, uncomfortable, unsanitary, or ""slum""-like accommodation, whether in guest houses, Airbnbs, or rented properties.

I've been buying coffee a long time and I have problems probably like most of you in wanting to buy and try. There was always a  barrier of having to bulk buy and freeze or buy more and needing to freeze. I do feel like this business model allows me to buy even when I have what I need but want to try more without having to commit to a full bag. 

But honestly gotta give DD props for sticking through his mission and taking hits even with tariffs and shipping delays. I know other businesses that have scaled back but he only doubles down lol. On top of that he gives free stuff out sometimes. He's willing to make less to see his vision through. I'm here to support and buy because I don't want this business model to disappear.

Discovering coffee gadgets is one of my favorite pastimes, especially when they’ve got the potential to up my brewing game. Recently, I gave the Hario V60 Immersion Dripper 03, also known as the ""Switch,"" a thorough trial in my home coffee routine. As someone who takes their morning brew seriously, I found this innovative pour-over and immersion hybrid to be intriguing. Did it live up to expectations? Here’s how it fared in my daily coffee explorations.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that caught my eye was the dripper’s sleek and functional design. It combines a cone-shaped glass body, which feels premium and classy, with a plastic switch mechanism that operates a stainless-steel ball valve. The glass cone is Hario’s signature heatproof glass—a definite plus if, like me, you value durability in a daily-use item. Its dimensions (6.1 x 5.5 x 6.3 inches) fit well on standard mugs and carafes, while its weight of just over a pound adds a balanced feel. Admittedly, the plastic switch at the base is less aesthetically pleasing than the rest, but it works without a hitch.

[Find the best price for Hario V60 Immersion Dripper 03 on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b09jl4r6sx/)

**Ease of Use**

One feature that I quickly came to appreciate was its dual brewing function—acting as both a regular pourover and an immersion brewer. The switch mechanism is intuitive; flipping it locks the coffee liquid in during brewing, giving you control over steeping time. Once ready, releasing the switch allows the coffee to flow freely into your cup. The addition of 40-size 03 V60 filters in the box means you can get started right away. I’ll admit, though, mastering the correct brewing ratio took me a couple of tries. If precision brewing isn’t your thing, you might need to experiment a bit before finding your perfect cup.

**Advantages**

The Hario ""Switch"" Immersion Dripper delivers several standout features that impressed me:

- Heatproof glass construction ensures durability and heat retention for brewing.  
- Hybrid brewing method accommodates diverse coffee preferences.  
- Compact build and sleek design make it appealing for countertops.  
- Easy-to-clean components streamline post-brewing chores.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**

As someone who has gone through countless coffee makers, I can confidently say this dripper doesn’t compromise on flavor. The immersion style brings a full-bodied, rich flavor profile, while the pourover option delivers clarity and clean notes. I tried beans with fruity undertones and found the immersion brew enhanced their sweetness, whereas the pourover highlighted the acidity. However, I did notice some sediment sneaking into the brew when I used a coarser grind, so consistent grind size is vital here.

**Flaws**

While the product impressed in many ways, there are areas worth noting:

- The plastic switch feels less durable compared to the glass construction.  
- Requires a bit of trial and error for optimal brewing.  
- Not as travel-friendly due to its weight and glass material.  

**Competing Brands**

Comparing the Hario V60 Immersion Dripper 03 to other market contenders like Chemex and AeroPress was interesting. Chemex wins in aesthetics and its all-glass design, but lacks the immersion brewing option. AeroPress, while more portable and quicker, doesn’t match the flavor complexity achieved with immersion brewing on the Hario. For the hybrid functionality it offers, this dripper stands out in versatility and taste.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its dual brewing functionality, heatproof build, and the included filters, I found this dripper to be a reasonably priced option for coffee enthusiasts. It brings significant versatility without diving into more expensive territory, making it a sound investment for someone who craves variety in brewing methods.

Love-hate, because yeah it would suck feeling like you've wasted half the day and now the weekends almost over, but getting to sleep in is something you can only do on the weekends. Every morning I wake up for work, I long for the weekend so I can sleep in. 

It used to actually bug me when I'd wake up naturally early on the weekends, id force myself back to sleep. Like ""what are you doing?! It's 7am, you literally start work at this time during the week! Go back to sleep and enjoy it while you can!"" 

Anyways, it's 10am Saturday morning and I've been up since 7am. And the last several months or maybe even the last year or so, *I don't even care* that I'm up early on the weekends. 

-----

It's also vice versa. As a teenager, total night owl. After highschool, I started getting tired earlier. Several years past highschool, I'm tired by 9pm, even on weekends. Just like waking up early / sleeping in, I hated going to bed early on the weekends, because I wanted as much me-time as possible. 

But now, I'm at a point of my life where I don't feel guilty for going to bed early on a Friday (or a Sat), because if I want to spend my Friday night sleeping, then that's what I'll do, happily. Although admittedly, I'll sometimes have an energy drink to avoid getting tired early because I still *wish I wasn't tired early* but I accept it if it happens.

He’s overall a great husband and father. And here comes the but….. He has a history of messing up gifts to me. Not all the time, if there is an object I say I love he sometimes will surprise me with that. On major birthdays he’s done great but I’ve just had the 15th Mother’s day with him and these have historically been more frustrating than not.

This Mother’s Day- I let him know I would be getting my flowers this year which has honestly been the best part of my Mother’s Day. I love flowers but am a bit particular. I’ve told him the types of flowers I like, even made him a spread sheet early in our relationship. But for years he’d just grab some roses from the supermarket and expect me to be thrilled. After having too many arguments- I just gave in and faked it for years.

To his credit, he was cool with me getting my own flowers. But when he asked what else he should get I said I’d like dark chocolate strawberries from a specific place close to us but if he wanted to get something else for the kids as well (ie get something for me AND  something for them) while he was there he should get a mix of fruit.

So this morning I got a small box of mixed chocolate covered fruit, ok frustrating but I could roll with it. Then came 6 small wrapped presents. My oldest made the comment about getting me a bunch of coffee mugs which would have been fine. Instead they were 6 beautifully scented candles which would be great if I didn’t have asthma and had expressed any desire for candles in the last 10 years maybe even 15 years. I kept on hoping the next one would be a coffee mug so they got to watch me try to keep a happy face while getting more and more frustrated. They went to bed bath and beyond - all sorts of things they could have got I could have used and they went all in on the one thing I can’t!

I think the worst of it is that for all my husband’s wonderful traits, he gets pissy if I don’t fully love what he gets me. Honestly, I wouldn’t be writing this if I could just express both appreciation for the thought but also honesty about liking it. Even more so if I felt like he could take constructive criticism and make more of an effort to get something I’d really like the next time.

It’s the combination of not being heard and having to fake being happy when actually you’re disappointed but you aren’t allowed to be disappointed! Add doing this year after year!

In his defense Christmas and Birthday’s - he normally does ok or sometimes great! It’s just Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day where he seems to feel like I just should be grateful and how I really feel doesn’t matter ",0,1746983023.0,Mom,0,0.5,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Some are coming home. Some tell lies to make it through the day. Others are just now facing the truth. Some are evil men, at war with good. And some are good, struggling with evil. 8 billion people in the world. 8 billion souls. And sometimes, all you need is one. (Inspired by One Tree Hill)

But sometimes, that one person isn’t a lover who saves you, or a friend who shows up at midnight. Sometimes, that one person is you. The you who didn’t quit. The you who made coffee after crying. The you who kept going, even when it felt like no one was watching.

Because life, isn’t always loud. Sometimes it’s soft, and slow, like rain falling on old sidewalks. It’s laughter echoing in kitchens, and songs that remind you who you were
before the world told you who to be.

Love isn’t always fireworks. Sometimes it’s eye contact across a crowded room, or forgiving yourself in the mirror. It’s shared fries, silent hugs, and knowing someone is out there, or in here, who gets it.

Friendship isn’t perfect. It breaks and mends. But when it’s real, it finds its way back. Even in the quiet, even when we lose the map, we carry pieces of each other stitched into our hearts like verses.

8 billion souls, each carrying stories, wounds, and wild, unfinished songs.

And if today, you feel like no one is your “one”, take a breath.

Because maybe the miracle is this:
You were always meant to be your own. Your one. And everything will fall together beautifully when you make yourself your one. 

And life? It’s beautiful. Messy. Unscripted. But yours. And worth every second of being here for it.",4,1746982763.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1kk5odu,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kk5odu/2_weeks_in_japan_itinerary_tips_top/,"2 weeks in Japan - Itinerary, tips, top recommendations for Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima, Osaka","Just back from a 2 week trip to Japan - my first - and I absolutely loved it.

**Top tips**

* Take 2 pairs of high quality tennis shoes.  I only took 1 because I wanted to save suitcase space; this was a mistake.  We averaged 15,000-18,000 steps a day - or according to my fitbit weekly report - 45 miles in one week.  You’re constantly going up and down stairs into the metro, temples, stores, etc. and the 15-18k doesn’t really capture the time you are actually spending on your feet browsing stores or standing to admire sights.  Midway through our time in Kyoto I started taking advil before bed to help the aching.  My shoes were in such bad shape at the end of the trip I threw them out.  Being able to rotate shoes would have been a huge help to my feet.
* Take the advice of everyone and pack a carry-on size suitcase inside your larger suitcase so you have an extra bag to fill with Japanese souvenirs.  If you don’t, you will likely either 1) buy a second suitcase in Japan or 2) come in at exactly 1kg under the baggage weight limit.  If you are able to get through a Japan trip without doing one of those two things, please contact me and explain how you avoided all the shopping.
* Most hotels have coin laundry so I did laundry halfway through the trip at the Hyatt Place Kyoto; the laundry machines were quite busy but I was waking up early from jet lag and able to get the 6am slot.
* To save your feet, just use Uber sometimes.  A lot of travel forums warned about how expensive cabs were in Japan, but this wasn’t my experience.  To/from Haneda Airport was about $85 and the cabs we took in Tokyo and Kyoto averaged $12-15.
* Download and use the smartEX app for the bullet trains (Shinkansen).  You can assign IC cards like Suica or Passmo to the bullet train tickets in the EX app and then use the IC physical card or app on your phone to swipe through ticket gates.
* Google maps is a wonder.  Make sure you have a data plan so you can use Google Maps to help you navigate the vast train, subway, and bus network.
* Jet lag for me on this trip was brutal.  It probably took me a week to fully adjust.  I have no solution for this other than make sure you include hotel breakfast when you book so you have something to do when you wake up at 5am.
* The egg salad sandwich at 7-Eleven and Family Mart are as good as everyone says.  Many nights we were exhausted (see tip one) and got an egg salad sando, drink, and dessert from 7-Eleven and it was a $4.85 dinner.
* Japanese toilets are amazing.  Go to as many bathrooms as possible to enjoy the variety and crazy bathroom signs.
* If you can avoid shopping (see tip two) you *could* do Japan very cheaply.  I did not.

There is so much good food, including at the 7-Eleven and Family Mart.  I would opt to try new places rather than making return trips to places we ate, even though some were amazing.  Exceptions are Sushi Sagane in Tokyo, Sakura Burger in Nara, and the Izakaya we found in Kyoto.  In the itinerary below, I linked to restaurants worth a visit if they’re convenient for you when you go.  

**Two Weeks in Japan: Our Itinerary** 

* Monday, April 21: depart USA
* Tuesday, April 22: arrived Tokyo.  Attempted to eat at Ramen Street in Tokyo station (failed) and ate egg salad sando from 7-Eleven instead.  First of many.
* Wednesday, April 23: Hotel served sashimi at breakfast, cementing my love for Japan on day 1.  Visited Senso-ji shrine, “kitchen street” shopping, wanted to go to Euno Park but it was raining so we went to Wendy’s for soy & butter fries instead, ate a second meal at Muji cafeteria, designed our own bags at Uniqlo, visited some stores in Ginza, drink at [Bar Four Seasons](https://g.co/kgs/k7v61Cx), omakase dinner at [Kyubey Okura Hotel](https://g.co/kgs/23hqE5g) branch, drink at [RC Gate Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WoXNSos6hvHDFyyA9) below our hotel.

**Things I would do differently in Tokyo**

* You don’t need a guided tour of the Tsukiji Fish Market.  It’s small enough that you could do self-guided and most of the vendors have food out for you to buy/try.  Our tour also leaned a bit too heavily on pushing us to stalls to shop, rather than focusing on trying foods.  Do this one on your own.
* We did 3 nights in Shinjuku when we got back to Tokyo after Kyoto - I would not stay in the Shinjuku area again.  It’s definitely worth a visit for shopping and bars, but stay somewhere else.
* In Golden Gai the bars are so tiny it’s hard for me to even describe how tiny they are.  They were full when we walked through but I don’t think I would have enjoyed it even if we had gotten in.  I had fun at the other bars I found in Shinjuku, so probably unpopular opinion here, but you could skip Golden Gai.
* If you can hold yourself back, save your purchasing until your final days.  Bags have to go overhead on the bullet trains, even large bags you would normally check on a flight, and they get heavy.  Many more shopping tips to come in a separate post.

**Things I would do differently in Kyoto** 

* Even though our Ryokan was incredibly nice, I would skip that in future because it’s so expensive ($1200/night).  The experience wasn’t worth that to me and I could have spent my half of the Ryokan cost buying another knife or more pottery.
* Skip the Gion Corner show - wasn’t a great show and the audience was super annoying.
* Our guided tour of Kyoto day was very ambitious and I wish we had more time at a few of the temples and shrines.  No way to solve this other than staying longer in Kyoto or doing fewer sites, and it’s hard for me to say which site I would have cut.  Probably the Golden Pavilion because it was crazy crowded and the Silver Pavilion was similar and much nicer.
* The popular temples get very crowded so if you’re willing to get up early, it would be worth it.  Especially at Fushimi Inari-Taisha which is open 24 hours.  Take advantage of the jet lag early wakeups!

**Favorites**

[Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo](https://www.ryumeikan-tokyo.jp/english/) \- was close to Tokyo Station, rooms were affordable enough we each got our own room, served sashimi at breakfast, had a very good dinner service, nice British pub at street level, very quiet.  This area is incredibly convenient to get anywhere else you want to in Tokyo or for bullet trains to other parts of Japan.  I absolutely loved this hotel and will only stay here on future trips to Tokyo.  

[Hyatt Place Kyoto](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-place/en-US/kyozk-hyatt-place-kyoto) \- although the staff left a bit to be desired when it came to being helpful at all, the room was large, breakfast was good but repetitive, and I really like the quieter part of town the hotel was in.  It was sitting above a subway station that was 4 stops from Kyoto station, making it easy to do our day trips too.  An Izakaya we found 2 blocks away was one of my favorite meals of the trip.

[TeamLab Borderless](https://www.teamlab.art/e/tokyo/) \- we had a really wonderful time at this museum.  It’s an interactive, always changing art museum and you have to search for rooms.  These are worth the search as they were some of the coolest installations.

The teas were diverse and lovely.

1kk5o7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1kk5o7o/sick_af_cross_contaminated/,Sick af cross contaminated,"Hey! I made a post yesterday about this but some of my symptoms are still ongoing and I'm kind of concerned because i haven't had this bad of a reaction to date. 

I got diagnosed about a year ago at this point, I was wayyy too lax at first but would usually only suffer from digestive issues. Once I got better with it and kept gluten out of my diet, I felt a lot better. But any time I accidentally came into contact after cutting it out, my symptoms would get worse and worse, exponentially every time. 

The other night I was in New York City with my boyfriend and his friends, it was around 1 in the morning and we were looking for something we could all eat. There was a taco truck, without thinking I asked the guy if the tacos were GF and he said yes. But dude, in a tiny ass truck like that, there's no way you're NOT getting cross contaminated from burritos and other things that they've been preparing on the same counter. It was a dumb move but I was hungry and wanted to go home. Cue the madness

So we live about 2 hours upstate from where we were at in Brooklyn. Once we're say, halfway up through the city, I get nauseous as fuck out of nowhere, feeling like I NEED to throw up, I throw my window open and stick my head out and try my hardest but nothing's coming. So I deal with some carsickness for a bit. I also tend to start coughing right after an exposure which is how I know sometimes. 

We get home and as I'm laying in bed I noticed the stomach pain starting to set in, at this point I already knew what was up from the carsickness. The next morning the stomach pain is much worse, and for some reason, my left wrist, right thigh, and left foot are particularly sore and hard to move around. This is still going on today. TMI but my BMs have been multicolor and clearly undigested. Brown, yellow, red, even some black chunks. It hurt so fucking bad but that part's over now I think. 

I've never had a long bad reaction like this, I've been drinking lots of water, Gatorade, been trying to eat fruits and cheeses and stuff for protein, I used to be a vegetarian and since the diagnosis I've tried to reintroduce meat but I still find it so hard to stomach, mentally, that is. 

Tried making GF pizza bagels last night after lightly grazing all day and couldn't even keep that down either. Even with all the healthy stuff, some blueberries and a few slices of pepper jack on the side. I'm trying so hard to eat but it's so unappetizing rn and everything hurts. When I threw up again last night it didn't even feel like it was coming from my stomach, it was as though it never even went down my throat, like it was coming from my esophagus and still tasted like food. 

I always need a lot of coffee and nicotine in the mornings to get my digestion going and even that isn't helping. I know it's not the best solution but at least it cleans me out, and I'm staying hydrated on top of it. 

It totally sucks ass though. I missed out on a really cool volunteer opportunity, me and my bf were both invited to work at a full moon festival and we would've gotten to do everything together. But it's a lot of being up on your feet and I can barely walk on this thing even still. It's mostly my right thigh bothering me today. I massaged the fuck out of my wrist, I think there was a knot in it? I ate a banana yesterday to try and help the cramping and I guess it worked somewhat. 

People around me think I have lymes? No ticks though, and all of these things are celiac symptoms. Like there's no other explanation than the taco truck because I really didn't eat much that day beforehand. 

I've been losing a shit ton of weight for like the last month or two, me and my bf have both been struggling to afford food but on top of that it's like I can't really eat more than 1 meal a day and maybe a snack or two throughout because of my stomach. Everything feels heavy no matter if it's something prepared totally safely, it's like no amount of food in my stomach feels comfortable no matter what it is. 

I used to be anorexic and I really wonder about gastroparesis. That's what I thought initially before I got the celiac diagnosis, actually. But right now? I haven't been eating as much, I wouldn't say slipping back into old ways just yet but it is getting bad. And now this is way, wayyyy worse. I've been kicking myself for months saying ""I need to see a specialist"" this that the other thing, but this whole incident has showed me I really can't fuck around anymore. Crohn's runs in my family as well, and there's a high chance of me having fucked up my intestines through my own actions as a teenager additionally. 

I just needed to rant. I've been in so much pain. Got high yesterday thinking it'd be a good distraction but nah, how would you like to feel EVERYTHING even more? And on a spiritual level, as though this is some divine punishment? God, help us all. Haha. ",2,1746982739.0,Celiac,1,1.0,False
1kk5npa,https://www.reddit.com/r/littleshortstories/comments/1kk5npa/a_growing_fate/,A growing fate,"It started with a cough.

Milo Jensen stood in the middle of the crowded subway platform, clutching his chest as a strange heat surged through his veins. He dropped his coffee. The paper cup rolled away, unnoticed by the throng of commuters. Then everything slowed. The noise dulled, the world muted like a scene under water.

He looked up. A train was speeding toward the platform—but something was wrong. Sparks burst from the rails. The train's headlights flickered erratically, and a metallic screech filled the air.

Milo saw it: the brakes had failed.

In a blur of motion, a stroller slipped from a mother’s grasp, rolling straight toward the edge.

He tried to scream, to warn her, but the sound caught in his throat. Then instinct kicked in. He ran.

Except he didn’t run. He blinked—and suddenly he was there.

Beside the stroller. Hand outstretched.

The world snapped back to speed. Milo yanked the stroller back just as the train roared past, missing it by inches. People screamed. A man fainted. But the child inside began to cry—alive.

Milo’s hand trembled. His mind raced.

How did he move that fast?

In the following days, it happened again. At the coffee shop when a hot kettle fell—he caught it without thought. At a construction site when scaffolding collapsed—he shielded a worker, body becoming like stone. Each incident triggered a new ability. Reflexes heightened. Skin hardened. Sight sharpened.

The powers came randomly, without warning, but always just in time.

And they always left after.

It became clear—Milo was being used. Or chosen. Something out there needed him to stop tragedies, even if he didn’t understand why.

Then came the fire.

An apartment complex ablaze, flames licking the sky. Sirens still distant. A girl trapped on the fifth floor balcony, coughing, barely visible through the smoke.

Milo hesitated. He didn’t feel anything. No heat in his chest. No buzz in his skin.

He was just...normal.

But he ran in anyway.

Up the stairs, through the black smoke, coughing, eyes burning. Wood cracked overhead. A beam fell—and stopped. Suspended. Milo stared in shock. His breath came easier. The smoke cleared slightly.

He realized: this time, the power wasn’t a surge. It was steady. Constant. There, because he chose to act before it arrived.

He found the girl, carried her down, his skin impervious to flame.

When the fire department arrived, they found them outside, safe. The girl clung to him, crying. Milo just smiled, eyes watering, not from smoke.

He didn’t know what tomorrow would bring. But for the first time, he wasn’t afraid.

Whatever this was, it wanted him to keep going. And so he would.

One miracle at a time.

In pure mom realism, it did not go according to plan. 

My husband was tired and run down. My 1 year old got up early because he got his arm twisted in the crib and didn't have his normal slow morning wake up. 

I got up right after I pumped to bring out the bottle of milk and saw my kiddo and husband up and hanging out. 🤷🏻‍♀️ immediately mom mode back on and engaged. 

We did our normal morning routine I do when I'm home with babes all days of the week. Change diaper. Feed bottle. I fixed him breakfast. We played. My husband d did dishes from all my pump parts during the night and morning. 

I got to go out for 20 min and pick up coffees for me and my husband. Came back and read stories for my one year old. Down for a nap. I could tell my husband was tired and run down and trying to stick it out. But I sent him for a nap too. 

I just finished my coffee and instead of making myself breakfast I'm just enjoying the quiet. Needless to say just adjusting on the fly for Mother's Day! And I am at peace with it.

1kk5lln,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1kk5lln/mothers_day_frustrations/,Mother’s Day Frustrations,"My husband is amazing - does more housework than I do (I’m messy, he’s not). He’s overall a great husband and father. And here comes the but….. He has a history of messing up gifts to me. Not all the time, if there is an object I say I love he sometimes will surprise me with that. On major birthdays he’s done great but I’ve just had the 15th Mother’s day with him and these have historically been more frustrating than not.

This Mother’s Day- I let him know I would be getting my flowers this year which has honestly been the best part of my Mother’s Day. I love flowers but am a bit particular. I’ve told him the types of flowers I like, even made him a spread sheet early in our relationship. But for years he’d just grab some roses from the supermarket and expect me to be thrilled. After having too many arguments- I just gave in and faked it for years. 

To his credit, he was cool with me getting my own flowers. But when he asked what else he should get I said I’d like dark chocolate strawberries from a specific place close to us but if he wanted to get something else for the kids as well (ie get something for me AND  something for them) while he was there he should get a mix of fruit. 

So this morning I got a small box of mixed chocolate covered fruit, ok frustrating but I could roll with it. Then came 6 small wrapped presents. My oldest made the comment about getting me a bunch of coffee mugs which would have been fine. Instead they were 6 beautifully scented candles which would be great if I didn’t have asthma and had expressed any desire for candles in the last 10 years maybe even 15 years. I kept on hoping the next one would be a coffee mug so they got to watch me try to keep a happy face while getting more and more frustrated. They went to bed bath and beyond - all sorts of things they could have got I could have used and they went all in on the one thing I can’t!

I think the worst of it is that for all my husband’s wonderful traits, he gets pissy if I don’t fully love what he gets me. Honestly, I wouldn’t be writing this if I could just express both appreciation for the thought but also honesty about liking it. Even more so if I felt like he could take constructive criticism and make more of an effort to get something I’d really like. 
 
It’s the combination of not being heard and having to fake being happy when actually you’re disappointed but you aren’t allowed to be disappointed! Add doing this year after year!

In his defense Christmas and Birthday’s - he normally does ok or sometimes great! It’s just Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day where he seems to feel like I just should be grateful

I found out I was pregnant on April 21st, my period was a day late but I honestly knew already as I felt like the last two weeks I had felt very fatigued and was really irritated and easily annoyed by little things (how dare my partner roll over and breath on me). 
As soon as I saw the positive lines I made an appointment to start the process, I’ve been with my partner for around three years and we both knew that bringing a child into this world is not something we’re prepared to do financially or emotionally. 
I went in for a physical appointment on May 5 - which put me at 6 weeks. 
Everyone at the clinic was kind, professional, and educated. I was very grateful for the care I was provided. 
I picked up the medication and also got a prescription for T3’s to help with some of the pain. 
Fast forward to Friday night I took the mife. 
Woke up Saturday feeling quite nauseous (this wasn’t anything new) but that did slowly progress throughout the day. I ended up leaving work at 1 pm and came home. I called my healthcare provider asking if I could take the miso a few hours early and they gave the go ahead. 
At 130 pm I took two gravol, a T3, and some ibuprofen as well (also ok’d by my medical professional) the nausea went away. I grabbed my heat pad and got ready to go. 
I inserted four tabs of the miso at 2 pm. 
The cramps started around 330 pm but I was fairly drowsy and nothing out of the normal compared to my regular period cramps, I started bleeding and passing some larger clots. 
The cramps ramped up around 5pm and I felt low and intense pressure and ended up passing the pregnancy. The cramps continued but did taper off and around 730/8pm and felt more like a period again. 
I took a smaller dose of ibuprofen and gravol and went to bed. 
I woke up not nauseous and feeling like myself again - I can finally enjoy coffee without gagging and I’m thrilled. 
I hope this can help someone who is scared of going forward with this, I know everyone’s experience is going to be different but I’m sending you all the love and light I can. ",3,1746982491.0,abortion,2,1.0,False

I spent a good amount of time looking at different options, testing them out, and reading up on reviews. The best one to come out of all that research is the [MuellerLiving French Press](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B07JGBK6XV). The 34oz size is perfect for making a decent amount of coffee without being too bulky, and the double insulation keeps your coffee hot for a good while. One of the things I like is how versatile it is not just for coffee, but you can also use it for tea or hot chocolate if you're in the mood for something different.

The design is pretty straightforward, and the 4-level filtration system makes sure that your coffee doesn’t have a bunch of grounds floating around. It’s also super easy to clean, which is a huge plus, especially if you're not into spending too much time maintaining it.

I did look into a few other options like the Bodum or Secura French presses. The Bodum is great, but it’s kinda fragile, and Secura’s good for durability but doesn’t have the same insulation, so your coffee cools off faster. So it’s a bit of a trade-off.

She watched the soft light of dawn break over the rooftops, painting everything in gold. She whispered a promise to herself: ""One day, I'll give him everything he dreams of.""

Maya worked two jobs—barista by day, cleaner by night. Her hands were always tired, her feet always sore, but every ache faded the moment Leo ran into her arms, squealing, ""Mama!"" His laughter was music, his hugs a balm.

One evening, after a particularly long shift, she found a crumpled drawing tucked into her bag. It was a stick figure with wild hair (her), holding hands with a smaller figure (Leo) beneath a rainbow. In shaky letters, it read: ""Best mom evr.""

Tears welled in her eyes as she pressed the paper to her chest. She didn't have much—no big house, no fancy car—but she had love, and she gave it freely.

On weekends, they'd dance barefoot in the kitchen, Leo standing on her feet as she twirled him around. They'd read the same book over and over, giggling at the silly voices she made. Sometimes, when money allowed, they'd share an ice cream and watch the stars come out.

Years later, Leo would remember those nights as the happiest of his life. He'd become a teacher, inspired by the woman who never gave up, who showed him that love could be fierce and gentle all at once.

And Maya? She would sit in the front row of his graduation, her hands clasped, her heart full. She had given him everything—not through wealth, but through love that never wavered.

My coworker, Sarah (27F), started around the same time, and we hit it off early on. We’d grab coffee, vent about work, and even hung out a couple times outside the office. I thought we were friends, or at least friendly.

Here’s the issue: Sarah has a side hustle designing logos and branding for small businesses. It’s not a secret, she posts about it on her Instagram, and I know she’s made decent money from it. Our company has a strict policy against doing freelance work that competes with our services, which graphic design definitely does. I never said anything because it wasn’t my business, and honestly, I didn’t care. Live and let live, you know?

A few weeks ago, we were both up for a big promotion to lead a new client project. It’s a huge deal, more pay, more responsibility, and a chance to prove ourselves. I worked my butt off preparing, but Sarah got the spot. I was bummed but figured she earned it.Then I found out why: during a team meeting, she took credit for a campaign idea I’d pitched to her privately and implied I’d been slacking on my work. Our boss ate it up, and I got a talking-to about “stepping up.” I was pissed but didn’t have proof to call her out, so I let it slide.

Then last week, I overheard Sarah on a call in the break room, bragging about landing a big freelance client, one of our company’s direct competitors. She was using our office resources (like her work laptop) to do it, which is a major violation. I was already mad about the promotion, and this felt like the last straw. I anonymously tipped off our boss with a screenshot of her Instagram post advertising her freelance services, mentioning the competitor client. I didn’t name myself, but I’m pretty sure Sarah knows it was me.

Yesterday, Sarah got called into HR, and she’s now on a performance improvement plan. She might even get fired if they dig deeper. She texted me, furious, saying I “ruined her career” and that I’m a backstabber for not talking to her first. My friends are split—some say she had it coming for screwing me over, but others think I went too far by snitching instead of confronting her directly. My boss hasn’t said anything, but I’m paranoid this could blow back on me if Sarah outs me as the tipster.I feel justified because she played dirty first, but I also wonder if I let my anger get the best of me.

1kk5dk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/advancedentrepreneur/comments/1kk5dk0/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_founders_to_bounce_off/,Why is it so hard to find founders to bounce off ideas in any city you are visiting? Why do you have to be in the inside circle and how to get in?,"I’m beyond frustrated, and I know I’m not alone. Every time I visit a new city—whether it’s for work, a conference, or just to explore—I try to connect with local founders to bounce ideas off, get feedback, or just nerd out about startups. But it’s like trying to crack a secret code. Unless you’re already in the “inside circle,” it feels impossible to get face time with anyone who’s actually building something cool.

Why is this so damn hard? I get that founders are busy—trust me, I am too. But it’s not just about time. It’s about access. In every city, there’s this invisible wall around the startup scene. If you’re not already part of the clique, good luck getting in. It’s like you need a VIP pass just to have a casual coffee chat. I’ve tried cold emails, LinkedIn messages, even showing up at random coworking spaces, but it’s always the same: crickets unless you’ve got a mutual connection or some magic key I clearly don’t have.

# The ""Inside Circle"" Problem

And don’t even get me started on the “inside circle” thing. It’s real, and it’s infuriating. These are the founders who know each other, go to the same events, get invited to the same Slack groups, and probably have each other on speed dial. They’re not trying to be exclusive (okay, maybe some are), but the result is the same: if you’re not in, you’re out. And for someone who’s just passing through or trying to break into the scene, it’s a nightmare. How am I supposed to talk shop with someone when I don’t even know where the shop *is*?

Look, I’m still figuring this out myself. Some cities are easier than others, and sometimes it feels like you’re shouting into the void. But I’ve had enough small wins to know it’s possible—it just takes way more effort than it should. Anyone else feel this pain? How do you break into founder circles when you’re not already in the club? I’d love to hear your war stories or secret hacks because I’m tired of feeling like an outsider every time I step into a new city.",1,1746981950.0,advancedentrepreneur,6,0.67,False

It started nearly 2 years ago and there is a very clear reason for it. I am a woman, I really wanted to have a family and kids... I was unable to conceive naturally and my husband of 8 years left me all of a sudden right before our planned IVF. I was already 38 and at this age it is virtually impossible to fulfill my life goals because relationships take time and reproductive aging is unforgiving. The shock of my husband betraying us suddenly (I considered him extremely reliable and not in my worst nightmares I imagine he'd leave me especially if we struggle with fertility) and the fact that it's impossible to turn back time and start over trying to make a family with someone else threw me in a deep depression. This was 2 years ago. 

I used to be perfectly capable to feel pleasure even fron little things like an ice cream or a good movie. But ever since the event I went totally numb and I can't enjoy anything. I am unable to watch a movie or TV show because first 5 minutes pass, and I'm already bored to death, cannot make it past first pages of a book (and I was an avid reader), food is ""meh"", everything is ""meh"". I have zero desire to do anything and I cannot get myself to exercise or live healthy. 

First they prescribed me SSRI which removed some of the crying spells I had, but did nothing to anhedonia. In fact it made me unable to feel any emotion - before I could at least be sad. So I hated them and stopped them. Later they put me on Wellbutrin. This one helps with energy so it's easier to get out of bed, but no pleasure can be felt. The only time I felt anything was when I had a serious surgery so my ex husband came to stay with me for one week and watch me as I was recovering. Despite the fact that he hurt me so much his physical presence enabled me to feel some pleasures although I was in pain - meals together, morning coffee, we watched some show, and it felt good. Psychiatrists I feel are just randomly trying different popular meds without too much thought. I do talk therapy once per week too but I don't think my therapist gets it, like her suggestions - oh go to the gym, do something for yourself - are totally useless as I can't get myself to do it. 

I leave alone and I have no family. I don't have desire to make friends or meet people, socialize. Seeing how happy other people are makes me feel worse. Losing my relationship at my age makes me feel like I lost all hope for the future, all is lost, and there is no fix. I also don't trust people anymore since the departure of my husband was so surprising.. I trusted him with my life and he put me on this road by his unilateral decision, a tough road I didn't choose.

While no one really knows exactly how the score is calculated, it can impact your ability to rent an apartment, get a loan, or even sign up for a phone contract.

When I first moved here, my score was pretty decent. But I made a few classic expat moves that dropped it dramatically, and I had to work hard to get it back up.

Here’s exactly what I did, what I learned, and how I got from 90.5% back up to 98.2%.

## When I First Moved to Germany: 97.53% SCHUFA

When I arrived in Germany, my situation looked like this:

* Just one bank account: [N26](https://nomadandinlove.com/go/N26)
* Living at a temporary address (WG/shared flat situation)
* Shortly after (within 6 months), I moved to a more permanent address.

My initial SCHUFA score? 97.53% — not bad for someone brand new to the country.

## Moving Apartments and Several Credit Facilities = Score Drop

Two years later, I moved again to my current address. During this time, I made a few financial decisions:

* Opened a free credit card account with [American Express PAYBACK](https://nomadandinlove.com/go/AmericanExpressPaybackCard)
* Bought a cellphone with interest-free 24-month Klarna installments
* Took out a small furniture loan via Targobank
* Bought a high-end [coffee machine](https://amzn.to/3YEhXIO) from Amazon and paid via Barclays Bank installments
* All Barclays Bank bills/statements were sent digitally, no paper mail.

Unfortunately, the result of all that?

> My SCHUFA dropped to 90.5%.

## 4 Years Later: From 90.5% Back Up to 98.2%

Over the next 4 years, I made the following changes:

* Paid off the Klarna phone installments
* Paid off the Targobank furniture loan
* Paid off the Barclays coffee machine loan
* Closed both Targobank and Barclays credit facilities
* Stayed at the same address (didn't move at all)

Recently, I requested my [free SCHUFA report](https://nomadandinlove.com/go/SchufaDataCopy) and was surprised to see my score had skyrocketed to 98.2%.

## The Address Glitch: A Hidden SCHUFA Killer

While reading through my latest report, I noticed something odd. Barclays had my address listed with the wrong house number.

Probably a small typo (maybe my own fault?), but since all communication was by email, I never noticed.

My theory: 

> SCHUFA thought I had moved again — when in fact, I hadn’t.

And frequent address changes are a known factor in lowering your score.

## What I Learned About Improving Your SCHUFA Score

Here’s what seems to make a positive impact:

### ✅ Stability Helps

* Staying at one address long-term
* Not opening or juggling too many credit accounts

### ❌ What Hurts

* Frequent address changes
* Multiple active loans or credit facilities
* Errors in your registered info (like a wrong house number!)

## Final Tips

1. Order your free SCHUFA report every year → [Here’s the official link to do that](https://nomadandinlove.com/go/SchufaDataCopy)
2. Check for errors in your address, bank info, and open accounts
3. Watch who's making credit inquiries — sometimes third parties may use your data without you realizing it.
4. Don’t apply for too many credit facilities at once, especially if you don’t need them.

## What’s Next?

I recently applied for a free [Advanzia Gebührenfrei Gold Mastercard](https://nomadandinlove.com/go/Advanzia) to test whether having two credit cards impacts my score.

Stay tuned! I’ll request my free SCHUFA again next year and report back on whether it made any difference.

Feel free to ask questions or share your own SCHUFA experiences below. I know this whole system can feel super opaque, especially when you're not a native German speaker.

**citizen soldier:** [You Are Enough](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nw8F34LKE&si=iHJvAprf7X50SAoG)

You see that glass half empty  
Each time you look in the mirror  
It's like the more you're trying  
Your flaws start showing up clearer  
You bleed emotion, so devoted to what people say  
So sick of hoping, so you focus on all your mistakes  
Stop changing, there's nothing to fix when life's a war for you  
That's when your pulse becomes the proof  
When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell  
And nobody understands that you are going through hell  
Right here, like this, right now  
You are enough  
When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough  
Being human is what makes you something worthy of love  
Right here, this sick, right now  
You are enough  
So don't give up  
With every passing stranger  
You find something that you're missing  
So kind, except to yourself  
You're anything but forgiving  
You bleed emotion, so devoted to what people say  
Give second chances left and right, and only take the blame  
Don't change a single thing 'cause there is nothing wrong with you  
What you feel now, don't make it truth  
When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell  
And nobody understands that you are going through hell  
Right here, like this, right now  
You are enough  
When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough  
Being human is what makes you something worthy of love  
Right here, this sick, right now  
You are enough  
Stop chasing something that you're never gonna find  
Already perfect, but your past has left you blind  
So when the voices in your head ain't being kind  
Here is something to remind you  
When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell  
And nobody understands that you are going through hell  
Right here, like this, right now  
You are enough  
When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough  
Being human is what makes you something worthy of love  
Right here, this sick, right now  
You are enough  
So don't give up

**\* \* \* I AM NOT A DOCTOR \* \* \***

this is not a post about medical advice nor requesting a diagnosis because ""i don't know what's wrong"".

i have no formal secondary education, no degrees, no certifications, nada.

  
***these things i am sharing are strictly my own thoughts, opinions, experiences, and life.***

  
i am openly sharing all of this because i want physicians and researchers to take me on as a case study

“Your position is rooted in your political ideology and not in any factual or data driven basis.  It is unfortunate you have chosen the side of hate, misinformation and fear mongering. It’s unfortunate you don’t have the capacity to stand for all kids in your district. - “Linsey Fields -  middle school basketball coach at Nisqually”

Ty Kuehl, The Olympian, Tumwater Police & “Linsey Fields”

Last week The Olympian reported School Board Member Ty Kuehl “Said one board member was spat on and another was directly threatened. One of them was followed out to their car. He said the situation escalated to where police had to be called. For the first time in his life, he filed a police report against someone who continually threatened him.”

This was after the February 27th, 2025 the Tumwater School Board meeting where the board passed a resolution stating:  ""participation in the 'Girls Category’ is limited to students whose biological sex is female” for sports in the Tumwater School District. 

Olympia News Network obtained the police report and the emails sent March 11th & 12th that Tumwater School Board Member Ty Kuehl said “threatened him”

Please note Olympia News Network has not verified “Linsey Fields” is the true identity of the person who sent the following emails.  We are publishing the emails between Tumwater School Board Member Ty Kuehl and a person identifying as “Linsey Fields”

However, on October 7th, 2022 The Olympian reported the following:

Linsey Fields, a city of Lacey employee who identifies as queer, stepped up to the podium during the public comment portion of Lacey City Council meeting to address two concerns: recent anti-Pride flag comments made by a city colleague and previous comments made by council member Ed Kunkel about the city’s flag policy being divisive because some flags represent “special interests.” 

“I am not a special interest group,” Fields said. “We are people who deserve respect and kindness. I will not be bullied or shamed into being less than I am, nor will I be shamed back into the closet.”

In the below transcriptions from the email exchanges Olympia News Network left the spelling/grammar as close to the original email as possible.  We did break up paragraphs into sentences so it would be easier to read.

We will be publishing photos of the emails in the comments section on our facebook page.

Emails between a person identifying themselves as “Linsey Fields” a “middle school basketball coach at Nisqually” and Ty Kuehl, Tumwater School Board member:

March 11th, 2025 – 3:03pm
From Linsey Fields:

I am a resident who lives and owns a home in Tumwater School District.

I am a lifelong athlete, a middle school basketball coach at Nisqually; and a supporter of womens sports at all levels.

I am once again emailing you about the absolute cowardice you displayed in voting to approve the resolution asking the WIAA to ban girls who are transgender from sports.

In the same breath, that you talked about respecting diversity and wanting all kids to feel safe and valued in your school system you also threw trans kids under the bus.

You pitted cis girls against trans girls, and you didn’t EVEN SOLVE A SINGLE ISSUE that girls face when accessing sports.  

You sided with the oppressor and not the oppressed and made it clear that you do not value LGBTQ kids or our families.

At a time when you could have stood up for tyranny, and stood up for your kids you folded like a cheap plastic chair.

You showed us exactly who you are and what you stand for which directly contradicts the oath that you took and TSP missions/values.

And it’s a shame that you took this route because girls in our country still face barriers to equitable participation.

You decision changed nothing about those circumstances and added nothing in terms of solutions.

The fact remains today as it did yesterday and the day before.

Trans kids accessing sports DOES NOT prevent cis girls from accessing sports.

Let’s not pretend that any of you care about girls’ sports because if you actually wanted to help solve the issue you would create an ad hoc committee, or hire a consultant to create a report on how your sports teams are fairing against Title 9.

And where you could invest or remove barriers.

I highly doubt you, without Google, could even name the top reasons girls don’t participate, but I will give you a hint it’s not trans kids.

You are a disgrace to our community and I look forward to supporting candidates who run against you.

Response from Tye Kuehl:

Dear Linsey,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your perspective.

I understand that this is an issue many in our community feel strongly about, and I appreciate your passion for supporting girls’ sports.

The resolution brought before the board was intended to address concerns regarding fairness and safety in girls’ athletics.

As a father of two daughters, I take these issues seriously, and my decision was based on what I believe best serves the integrity of biological girls’ sports while ensuring a level playing field and a safe environment for all participants.

Importantly, this decision does not exclude transgender athletes from participating in school sports.  

Rather, it affirms that biologically male athletes, including trans girls, will continue to have opportunities to compete in divisions that align with their biological characteristics , such as boys’ teams or potential open divisions should they be created in the future.

I also recognize that there are broader challenges facing girls’ participation in athletics, including access, funding, and support.

Ensuring all student-athletes have opportunities to thrive is important, and I welcome further discussions about ways we can strengthen our programs and remove barriers that exist today.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I encourage continued engagement as we work to support all student-athletes in the district.

Best,
Ty Kuehl
Tumwater School Board

Response from Linsey Fields:

Dear art, 

This email in itself is a farce.

Trans-girls accessing sports are not an issue and they do not prevent cis-girls from participating.

In fact the date shows us overwhelmingly when you removed barriers from Trans-girls to access sports you remove barriers who ALL girls.

How many times has your daughter been injured by a trans-girl in sports?

Without knowing what sports they play, I can still imagine every instance of a push, shove, smack talk came from a cis-girl.

Sports and gender-affirming sports, as you know, can change the course of a kids life.

It provides them opportunities to grwo  that other activities do not; you have completely destroyed those chances for trans-kids and what a shame you spout concern but use the language of opperssors.

If you are wondering how you would have acted in history when given the chance to stand up for oppressed groups; you now have your answer.

You are the oppressor in this story, and yet the irony is you have made it that much harder for your daughters to access sports.

Would you like a comprehensive list or guide for research on this topic?

I can provide numerous studies and data on how trans-kids accessing gender affirming sports DOES not affect cis-girls.

Because if you actually do care about girls sports like you say then you should be acting to remove all barriers.

I wonder if you have thought through the logical conclusion of this?

The bottom line is, don’t lie if you are transphobic and don’t support trans kids.

Just say that, own up to it.

Don’t hide behind a veil of “protecting girls’ sports” when you haven’t done a single thing to actually address these issues.

And for the record that top reasons girls stop or don’t access sports are:

- Lack of access
- Saftey and Transportation Issues
- 

Lets stop pretending and just be honest.

Because this email you just sent me was saying a whole lot without saying shit.

In conclusion, I still look forward to supporting your recall and eventual re-election.

Response from Ty Kuehl:

Dear Linsey,

I appreciate you taking the time to write back and share your perspective.

I can see that you feel very strongly about this issue, and I respect your passion and advocacy.

I understand that we may not see eye to eye on this topic, but I want to be clear that my support for this resolution was based on what I believe is best for fairness and safety in girl’s athletics.

As a father of two young daughters, one of whom is just starting to explore sports, I take these issues seriously and want to ensure that they, along with all girls in our community, have a fair and safe environment to compete in as they grow.

Additionally, many members of our community have expressed support for this stance, and I believe my vote reflects the concerns of a significant portion of those I represent.

That said, I also recognize that there are broader challenges in girls’ sports, including access, funding, and opportunities, as you have outlined in your bullet points, and I welcome further discussions about how we can work together to address those concerns.

I know this is a complex issue with strong opinions on all sides, and I appreciate hearing from community members who care about our students and their opportunities.

Thank you again for reaching out.

Best regards,
Ty Kuehl
Tumwater School Board Member

Response from Linsey Fields:

You are right Ty,

We will never see eye to eye on this issue.

Because my position is not rooted in passion (although I am passionate) it is rooted in data and research.

So let me be clear, your position will not only harm trans-kids; it will ultimately harm your daughter and all girls.

Because your position is rooted in extremely sexist ideas, ones that I thought we had put to rest long ago.

Emails will not solve this issue.

I am requesting a meeting.

I think we should meet for coffee, it’s on me.

Or at your board office.

Because I think you’re really very wrong about this, and all you are doing is taking girls athletics back to the 90s.

And though I loved the 90s I did not love the sexism in sports.

So when are you available?

I have calm and reasonable conversations about this topic all the time.

You say your vote reflects some people in the community that support this stance.

But should your vote not support the oath you took?

Should it not support the entire community perspective?

Should it not support the actual trans-kids that will be harmed?

Because it feels like your vote supports your political stance and your own political agenda.

Again thats not me berating you, I just need you to understand that you have not created a safer athletic world for your daughters.

You are just making it harder for them to exist, especially if they don’t conform to rigid sex based norms.

March 11th, 2025 – 5:30pm
Response from Ty Kuehl:

Dear Linsey,

I appreciate you continuing to engage in this conversation, and I respect your commitment to advocating for what you believe in.

You’ve made a strong claim that my position will somehow harm my daughters, but as their father, I take their well-being and future in athletics seriously.

I do not believe that advocating for fairness and safety in girls’ sports puts them at any disadvantage- quite the opposite.

Ensuring they have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field is something I believe is in their best interest, just as it is for all female athletes.

I also recognize that no amount of debate will change our fundamental perspectives on this issue.

Given that reality, I don’t believe a meeting would be productive, so I will respectfully decline your invitation.

That said, I do not agree with the assertion that my vote reflects only a narrow political agenda.

Quite the opposite- I have heard from many in our community who support this resolution and believe it aligns with their values and concerns.

While I acknowledge that some strongly disagree, I believe my vote represents the majority sentiment in our district.

I appreciate you reaching out and sharing your perspective, but I stand by my decision as one made in the best interest of student-athletes in Tumwater.

Ty Kuehl

Response from Linsey Fields:

Like I said your position is rooted in your political ideology and not in any factual or data driven basis.

It is unfortunate you have chosen the side of hate, misinformation and fear mongering.

It’s unfortunate you don’t have the capacity to stand for all kids in your district.

The fact you will not meet with me, as I honestly believe dialogue and conversation is the only way out of this mess, proved that you have no capacity to grow and learn.

Your are voting with what you believe politically; and not what’s actually best for trans kids, cis-girls or athletes.

If you honestly did care about girls sports you would have raised the issues of fairness and safety much earlier in your tenure.

And honestly you would address real issues.

The school district that my property taxes pay for is bankrupt and you all are focused on solution looking for a problem instead of real problems.

And quite frankly I call bullshit; I have heard, had conversations, and sat in on lots of community groups trying to figure out how to recall you and the others as they DO NOT support your position.

I have heard from kids themselves at Tumwater.

And the very fact that your board meeting got shut down in protest only proves my point.

You are not voting as your oath dictates, your voting with your own self interests.

Since you are not brave enough to meet me, or listen to your constituents.

I am attaching educational materials in the vain hope you have the courage to grow and learn.

You are not advocating for fairness; let’s be very clear you are advocating for exclusion of specific people.

Advocating for fairness and safety would mean that you address the issues of fairness and safety.

And because you will not actually learn what issues girls face in sports; and make those corrections you kids and everyone else’s will be directly harmed by this decision.

It’s not a feeling it’s a fact if you don’t believe me.

Here are the resources that support this claim>

Thank you for making sure that I, Linsey Fields, run against you or support a candidate that does.

Response from Ty Kuehl:

Linsey,

At this point, it’s clear that we fundamentally disagree, and no amount of back-and-forth will change that.

I have been respectful and professional in my responses, and I have clearly explained my reasoning.

It’s unfortunate that you have chosen to dismiss my position as purely political rather than acknowledging that reasonable people can have different perspectives on this issue.

I also recognize that you are trying to pull me into a debate, looking for me to stumble or say something you can us against me.

I will not play that game.

My role is to represent the district and make decisions based on what I believe is in the best interest of fairness and safety in girls’ athletics- not argue endlessly with those who simply want to discredit me.

I stand by my vote and my belief that many in our community share these concerns, even if they are not as vocal as those who oppose the resolution.

The fact that some groups are discussing a recall does not negate the fact that I have also heard from many individuals-parents, athletes, and community members- who support this stance.

As for the board meeting, protests do not determine right and wrong.

Difficult issues often bring passionate responses, and disagreement does not mean that a decision is invalid.

My responsibility as a board member is to consider all perspectives, not just the loudest voices.

I appreciate that you have taken the time to express your position, but I will not be engaging further in this conversation.

Best regards,
Ty Kuehl
Tumwater School Board Member

Response from Linsey Fields:

It is very clear that we disagree fundamentally because I believe trans-kids deserve the right to exist, thrive and be apart of their community the same as every other kid.

And you wish to hide them, to discredit them, to blame them, and to villainize them.

I am not looking for a debate, I wanted to have a conversation with you.

I wanted to see if you could recognize the harm you are doing.

I wanted to see if you would be open to learning and growing as a human.

I wanted to see if your position was rooted in data or facts.

And I got my answer.

Your position is not factual based, not backed by science, and not backed by reality.

It’s your political grandstanding.

Its clear you have no ability to learn, or grow or educate yourself.

Which is wild because you sit on a board for education.

Let me be clear, I will not be doing away in time soon.

What you have done is a violation of these kids civil rights and their dignity.

All to score points with the political right, which you clearly seem to support.

I won’t stop emailing you, I wont’ stop showing up to public meetings, and I won’t stop until you and every board is facing a recall; and voted out when your time is up.

Let me be even more clear; your position is not reasonable.

Your position is rooted in the denial of humanity; the dismissing of a protected class; and in the need to demonize children for your political leverage.

That’s not rational that’s illegal.

We understand each other perfectly because I will not stop protecting the rights of all girls to access sport including trans-girls.

And you will continue to entrench yourself in your political viewpoints and never open yourself up to the idea that you could be wrong on this issue.

And that is absolutely the wrong type of people we need in public office.

Sincerely,

Linsey Fields

Response from Ty Kuehl:

Linsey,

Your message is no longer an attempt at discussion- it is harassment and intimidation.

Let me be clear:  I will not be intimidated.

You may disagree with my vote, but I will not tolerate threats, baseless legal accusations, or attempt to pressure me through relentless personal attacks.

I have engaged with you respectfully and professionally despite our clear differences.

You have now made it clear that you intend to target me personally, repeatedly harass me via email, and attempt to disrupt public meetings in retaliation for my vote.

That is not advocacy- it is harassment.

Because of the threatening nature of your email, I have forwarded this message to local law enforcement for documentation.
Any further emails of this nature will also be documented and handled accordingly.

You have made your position clear.

I have made mine clear.

This conversation is over.

Ty Kuehl
Tumwater School Board Member

Documented Examples of Harassment & Intimidation from Your Emails:

Threats of Continued Harassment

- “I won’t stop emailing you, I won’t stop showing up to public meetings, and I won’t stop until you and every board member is facing a recall.”

- “Let me be even more clear; your position is not reasonable.  Your position is rooted in the denial of humanity… That’s not rational, that’s illegal.”

Personal Attacks & Baseless Accusations

- “It’s clear you have no ability to learn, or grow or educate yourself.”

- “You are not advocating for fairness.  You are advocating for the exclusion of specific people.”

-  “You have chosen the side of hate, misinformation, and fear-mongering.”

-  “You will continue to entrench yourself in your political viewpoints and never open yourself up to the idea that you could be wrong.”

False Claims & Retaliatory Threats

-  “What you have done is a violation of these kids’ civil rights and their dignity.”

-  “We understand each other perfectly because I will not stop protecting the rights of all girls to access sports including trans-girls.”

-  “I have heard, had conversations, and sat in on lots of community groups trying to figure out how to recall you.”

Inappropriate Claims About My Own Daughters

- “You have made it that much harder for your daughters to access sports.”

-  “You have not created a safer athletic world for your daughters.  You are just making it harder for them to exist, especially if they don’t conform to rigid sex-based norms.”

Final Notice

These statements are not attempts at dialogue- they are clear intimidation tactics meant to harass and pressure an elected official into silence.

This is now a documented pattern of harassment.

Any further communication of this nature will be immediately forwarded to law enforcement.

Response from Linsey Fields:

It’s absolutely laughable you believe my email to be threatening.

It’s absolutely ridiculous you believe holding public officials accountabile is a threat.

I am well within my constitutional rights to contact you and continue to contact you regarding issues that you vote on that affect our community.

Nothing I said was “threatening” and you weaponization of the police against a public member questioning your public position is a misuse of public funds.

And absolutely you threatening me and trying to intimate me into shutting up.

It won’t work.

I look forward to hearing from the police and exonerating myself.

From the Tumwater Police Report:

Case#: 2025-00348 

On 3/12/2025 at 1102 hours, I was dispatched to a threats-via-email complaint located at (REDACTED by ONN)

Ty Kuehl was reporting that he was a school board member and was receiving threatening emails. 

I contacted Kuehl by phone who told me the following: he was a board member for the Tumwater School District. 

Recently, the board had voted on a decision regarding girls sports that had resulted in public backlash.

Kuehl said he had been receiving emails to his work email (ty.kuehl@tumwater.k12.wa.us) regarding the issue, and said one particular person had been sending him threatening emails. 

Kuehl said that a ""Linsey Fields"" had sent him messages insulting him, threatening to have him recalled, and wanting to meet with him. 

All communication had occurred via his official email within his capacity and actions as a school board member. 

He advised that at this time he had not received any direction from the school district as to how to proceed with unwanted email contact from the public regarding their functions. 

Kuehl would like the incident documented, as there had been protests recently and he was concerned the issue may escalate. 

Kuehl provided the emails in question. 

I reviewed the emails which can be summarized in the following: "" Between 3/11 at 1503 hours and 3/12 at 1122 hours, Linsey Fields (linseyf33@gmail.com) exchanges approximately 13 emails with Kuehl.

Some emails appear to be partial duplicates. 

Fields expresses extreme dissatisfaction with Kuehl regarding the school board`s decision. 

At several times she accuses Kuehl of being transphobic, pushing a personal agenda, and requests to meet in person over coffee to discuss the issue. 

Kuehl provides several reasonably professional responses attempting to explain his position and ultimate decision. 

Fields continues to claim that Kuehl is violating his duty as a public servant, implies he is a poor father, and states that she hopes Kuehl is recalled. 

Kuehl eventually thanks her for her concerns and states he will not be engaging further. 

Fields states that she will not be ""going away"", and intends to continue to participate in email and public meetings regarding the topic. 

Those emails were attached to this report. For details regarding specific language, grammar, and quotes, I would refer the reader to those emails. 

At no point in any of this communication are any statements of physical violence, threats, or coercion made. 

Currently, Fields is communicating with a public official (Tumwater School Board) using a designated channel (school email) regarding a decision Kuehl made. 

Fields is clearly upset, and uses various language that is clearly emotionally charged but not violent or reasonably indicative of any threats of harm. 

Fields wishing that Kuehl is recalled and/or not reelected is not a reasonable concern of safety. 

The method and message of Fields` communication with Kuehl at this time does not rise to a criminal level. 

On 3/13, I was able to contact Linsey Fields first by her email and then by phone. 

She told me the following: Fields was aware of why I was contacting her. 

She explained she sent the same initial email to all the school board members who had voted like Kuehl, but he appeared to be willing to speak with her and continued to engage in conversation. 

Fields said she did not intend to harm anyone, did not know Kuehl outside of the context of the board meeting, and stated she commonly participated in public issues and attempted to form personal relationships with officials by meeting with them for discussion. 

I provided Fields the case information for her own records. 

This report is for informational purposes at this time. 

If more information is later provided, this case could be reopened.

Here’s what I look like: https://imgur.com/a/ykvuGj8

Friends say I’m thoughtful, affectionate, and weird in the best way. I say I’m curious, caring, occasionally chaotic, and the kind of bossy that plans the best dates, takes the lead without hesitation, and might gently, but firmly, tell you where to sit. I lead with confidence and prefer dynamics where that energy is welcomed and appreciated.

I’ve got a roof over my head, a stable income, and a car I don’t drive. Full time passenger princess, part time vibe curator.

I share my life with an amazing, drama-free nesting partner. They’re disabled and I’m their carer, so I’m not available 24/7, but I’ve got plenty of space (emotionally and physically) for someone special. I practice kitchen table poly and I’m all about connections that feel intentional, warm, and exciting in that slow burn way.

Also: I’m disabled too. I use a walking stick and have low-energy days, which means I’ve mastered the art of comfy dates, deep chats in bed forts, and taking life at a pace that feels good. I’m independent, self-aware, and believe rest is as radical as romance.

Some of the things I love: Dancing to 80s bops while making tea. Getting weirdly competitive over vintage finds in charity shops. Loving every cat like it’s the last cat on earth. Losing hours to a good book, a creepy podcast, or a truly unhinged true crime doc. Rainy days. Wandering slowly through nature. Romanticising the hell out of the ordinary.

What I’m looking for: Good conversation first, then let’s see. I’m open to something real if we click. Mental spark, emotional connection, shared values. Ideally, you’re somewhere near SW England (or close enough that “want to grab a coffee?” doesn’t require planning a flight). Long distance is fine if seeing each other semi-regularly is actually possible.

I’m into people who are clever, kind, emotionally literate, and just a little odd in the best way. Playful, curious, grounded.

1kk54gf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kk54gf,This has been my go to Breakfast/Lunch for 3 months.,"(Plus or minus light ranch, 0cal ranch seasoning, fruit, chicken, tuna lol)

I’m down 31 pounds and I’m rapidly approaching my GW, and no matter how big or small I’ve been- I have always had to eat a lot to kill cravings for Nicotine or just depression. I’m extremely stubborn and I’ve stuck to a pattern that has made this meal feel like 3 times as much and if this can help atleast one person even years from now then I’ll be so happy. (Or I get roasted for my ingredients 😂).

(Everyone has different Reasons/Goals so adjust as needed).

Get to work (4:45am): My protein coffee + water and vitamins (chocolate protein powder and black coffee).

Prepare lunch (10-11am): My two stuffed burritos, and a bowl of Iceberg Mix, and my Protein Queso I make at home.

THE IMPORTANT PART!
Eating rules: Only water while the act of eating is taking place!

Eating order:
1. One Burrito 12oz of water 
2. Half of my salad or whole thing (usually 1.5-2 Cups est)
3. One Burrito 12oz of water.
4. Usually the other half of my salad.

After meal: now I drink my Coke Zero or Diet DrPepper. (This is my absolute favorite part, due to the soda bloats me and I make it to 5pm no problem and head home still full feeling)
And drink water still haha.

Here’s what I look like: https://imgur.com/a/ykvuGj8

Friends say I’m thoughtful, affectionate, and weird in the best way. I say I’m curious, caring, occasionally chaotic, and the kind of bossy that plans the best dates, takes the lead without hesitation, and might gently, but firmly, tell you where to sit. I lead with confidence and prefer dynamics where that energy is welcomed and appreciated.

I’ve got a roof over my head, a stable income, and a car I don’t drive. Full time passenger princess, part time vibe curator.

I share my life with an amazing, drama-free nesting partner. They’re disabled and I’m their carer, so I’m not available 24/7, but I’ve got plenty of space (emotionally and physically) for someone special. I practice kitchen table poly and I’m all about connections that feel intentional, warm, and exciting in that slow burn way.

Also: I’m disabled too. I use a walking stick and have low-energy days, which means I’ve mastered the art of comfy dates, deep chats in bed forts, and taking life at a pace that feels good. I’m independent, self-aware, and believe rest is as radical as romance.

Some of the things I love: Dancing to 80s bops while making tea. Getting weirdly competitive over vintage finds in charity shops. Loving every cat like it’s the last cat on earth. Losing hours to a good book, a creepy podcast, or a truly unhinged true crime doc. Rainy days. Wandering slowly through nature. Romanticising the hell out of the ordinary.

What I’m looking for: Good conversation first, then let’s see. I’m open to something real if we click. Mental spark, emotional connection, shared values. Ideally, you’re somewhere near SW England (or close enough that “want to grab a coffee?” doesn’t require planning a flight). Long distance is fine if seeing each other semi-regularly is actually possible.

I’m into people who are clever, kind, emotionally literate, and just a little odd in the best way. Playful, curious, grounded.

As someone who values both efficiency and functionality in home appliances, I tested this reverse osmosis (RO) system extensively to see if it truly delivers on its promises. And while I’ve been mostly satisfied with its performance, there are a few areas to consider.

**Elegant and Space-Saving Design**

One of the first things I noticed is the sleek and contemporary design of this RO system. Its tankless design isn’t just aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly practical. Having dealt with bulky, traditional systems with tanks hogging all the under-sink space, this was a refreshing change. It fits comfortably under the sink and leaves ample room for other household utilities—it’s a blessing for small kitchens. The stylish finish perfectly complements modern kitchen setups, making it more than just a functional appliance.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**

This RO system boasts an impressive 800 gallons per day (GPD) capacity. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever needed that much water in one day, but it gives me peace of mind knowing it’s designed to meet high demands—great for a larger household or if you’re hosting family gatherings. The 3:1 pure-to-drain ratio is another strong feature here. Traditional systems often waste more water than they purify, which has always irked me. The reduced waste output of this unit feels like a win both economically and environmentally.

If you’re curious about filtration, this system features 10-stage technology, which effectively reduces contaminants like PFAS, chlorine, lead, and fluoride. I used a TDS meter to compare the water before and after filtration, and there was a significant difference. The water tastes noticeably cleaner, and it even helped improve the flavor of my coffee and homemade soups. For those keen on safety, the certifications (NSF/ANSI 42, 53, 58, and 372) mean you’re investing in something tested against industry standards.

**User-Friendly Smart Faucet**

The smart faucet included with this system adds an element of convenience. Its built-in TDS display lets you monitor water quality right at the source, which is a handy feature for tech enthusiasts like me. Additionally, the LED light on the faucet deserves praise. It automatically turns on when water flows, making it easy to use even during late-night kitchen runs. With a lifespan of up to 50 years for the LED, maintenance concerns are minimal, and that’s a big plus for people who prefer low-maintenance appliances.

**Benefits**

- Tankless design creates more under-sink storage.  
- Certified for safety standards (NSF/ANSI 42, 53, 58, and 372).  
- Efficient 3:1 pure-to-drain ratio conserves water.  
- High filtration capacity (800 GPD) meets family demands.    
- Smart faucet with TDS display enhances usability.  

**Areas of Improvement**

While there’s a lot to like, the system isn’t without its challenges.

- Installation requires drilling two holes, which could intimidate a DIY novice.  
- Although compact, the power cord might limit placement flexibility.  
- The price point might feel steep for budget-conscious buyers.  

**Competing Products**

In terms of market rivals, I’ve compared the G3P800 to brands like APEC and iSpring. While all of them excel in water filtration, the Waterdrop system edges ahead in terms of sleek, space-saving design and advanced technology. APEC systems, although reliable, still rely on tank designs, making them bulkier. The iSpring products, on the other hand, are competitively priced but lack the same level of filtration efficiency and smart features. In particular, the smart faucet feature sets this unit apart for anyone seeking a tech-savvy solution for water safety.

**Affordable Quality**

Considering all its features, this RO system offers considerable bang for your buck. Its price point is justified by premium filtration, cutting-edge design, and user-centric features that are seldom available in one package. The reduced water wastage alone could offer long-term savings, not to mention the convenience of having purified water readily available. Sure, there are more budget-friendly options, but they might not match the robustness and efficiency of this system.

1kk52um,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kk52um/the_moon_remembers/,The Moon Remembers,"I was ten years old the first time I really *saw* the Moon. Not just noticed it—like pointing out clouds shaped like dragons or dogs—but *saw* it. Felt it. Understood, in that strange and silent way kids sometimes do, that it was more than a circle of light in the sky. It was a witness. A listener.

It was August. Late enough in the season that the crickets sounded like they were winding down their symphony, but still hot enough that the sweat never dried from the backs of my knees. I was lying in the yard, grass clinging to my arms, popsicle juice drying sticky on my chin. I had snuck out after dinner, barefoot, still in my shorts, daring the mosquitoes to find me.

And there it was. The Moon. Huge. Yellow-white. Sitting just above the treeline like it had been waiting for me.

I don’t know why I whispered “Hi.” I didn’t believe in God—not the way they talked about Him in Sunday school. But the Moon? It felt closer than that. Like it had seen everything and wasn’t judging any of it.

That was the first night I stayed out long enough to watch it move—just barely. I remember blinking and realizing it had shifted, like a slow breath I hadn’t noticed. And suddenly I felt both very small and strangely important. Like the Moon had made time to see *me*.

From then on, it became habit. I started watching it. At first, in the same way I watched cartoons or my mom baking—comforted by the rhythm, soothed by its presence. Then more seriously. I read books. Memorized the phases. Made little notes in a spiral-bound notebook: “Waxing crescent, thin like a smile. 8:43 p.m.” “Gibbous tonight. Bright enough to see shadows in the grass.” I drew it obsessively—badly, at first, then with some skill. My art teacher once said, “You draw like you're trying to remember something.” I think I was.

The Moon became my ritual.

When my dad left the following summer—bags packed in the trunk before I even got out of bed—it was the Moon I ran to. I sat in the yard with my arms around my knees, waiting for it to rise. When it did, I whispered everything I couldn’t tell my mom. The Moon listened. I imagined it had seen every goodbye in history. Ships pulling from shore. Letters crumpled, unread. Fathers closing doors without a glance back.

Years passed. Life shifted, as it always does.

Middle school brought braces and awkward silences. High school brought crushes and crying in bathrooms, friendships that burned bright and vanished like fireworks. And through it all, the Moon came back night after night, in one shape or another. Always different, always familiar.

I remember my first kiss was under the Moon. It was late October, the air smelled like leaves and the faintest promise of cold. We were sitting on a park bench, my hands shaking more from nerves than chill. The kiss itself was clumsy and too quick, but the Moon—just over her shoulder—glowed softly like it approved. I remember thinking, *This is what poets write about.* And then I laughed, because I didn’t read much poetry, and it felt ridiculous to feel so much over something so small.

But it wasn’t small. None of it was.

In college, I drifted far from everything familiar. Different city. Different people. I stopped drawing the Moon, but I didn’t stop watching it. Some nights, I’d find myself on the rooftop of my dorm, headphones in, staring upward like I was waiting for a sign. On rough nights—nights when anxiety curled tight in my chest, when home felt like another planet—I’d just breathe and repeat the names of the phases, like a prayer:

*Waxing crescent. First quarter. Waxing gibbous. Full. Waning gibbous. Last quarter. Waning crescent. New. Start again.*

The Moon made sense. It had order, even when I didn’t.

The night Milo, my old beagle, passed away, I was home for winter break. He had stopped eating. Just laid on the floor beside the heater, tail thumping weakly when I sat down. I wrapped him in a blanket and carried him to the backyard. We sat under the stars. The Moon was a sharp little crescent, thin and cold. I whispered to Milo, but I also whispered to the Moon.

“Please let him be okay.”  
“Please don’t let him be scared.”  
“Please remember this.”

And when he was gone, I cried into the sky, the Moon the only one who didn’t look away.

Now, years later, I live in a city high enough that I can see clear across rooftops, past traffic and antennas and the glow of signs that never sleep. I stand out on my balcony most nights, cup of tea in hand, blanket around my shoulders, and look up.

The Moon doesn’t always show. Sometimes it hides behind clouds, behind light, behind the long days where I forget to check. But it comes back. Without fail. In some shape. In some way.

And every now and then, when life feels too big, or too loud, or too quiet, I whisper, “Hi,” just like I did when I was ten.

Just in case it remembers me.

Just in case it was never the Moon I was talking to, but something older than that—something watching through it. Through all of it.

Maybe it’s not the Moon that remembers me.

Maybe I’m the one remembering myself.

Adulthood doesn’t arrive all at once. People talk about milestones—college degrees, first jobs, mortgages, marriage—as though they unlock some door that you step through, leaving your younger self behind. But I never felt a door open. It was more like walking deeper into a forest, the path only visible in the rearview of memory.

The Moon came with me, of course.

I moved into my first apartment at twenty-six. Small, creaky-floored, with one window that faced an alley and another that faced a sliver of sky. That sliver was all I needed. On the first night I slept there, among boxes and the hum of the refrigerator, I pulled back the curtain and smiled. A waxing crescent was just visible above the neighboring rooftops. Not bright, but *there*. I took it as a good sign. A new cycle beginning.

Life blurred for a while after that. Days were full of work, bills, deadlines. I started teaching at a high school. I liked it more than I expected. There was something quietly profound about watching kids go through the same kinds of heartbreak and hope that I once did—something sacred in the repetition of it. Some nights, when I stayed late grading papers and the halls had gone silent, I’d walk to the parking lot and look up.

The Moon never felt smaller than it did then—trapped behind the light pollution, blurred by city haze. But even so, when I saw it, my breath always slowed. I always felt like someone was keeping track of me.

Eventually, I fell in love.

Not the heady, fast-burning kind from high school, but something quieter. She was kind in a way that didn’t need to be loud. She noticed the little things—refilled the coffee pot, left notes in my lunch, listened without needing to fix everything. The first time she spent the night, I woke before dawn and found her asleep beside me, the Moon still hanging pale outside the window. I didn’t move. I just watched the soft light across her face and whispered, “Thank you,” to whatever force had carried me to her.

We married two years later. It was a simple ceremony—outside, of course. The Moon rose partway through the reception, almost full. My mother, tipsy from wine and nostalgia, pointed it out. “Your old friend’s here,” she said, nudging me with a wink.

And it was. Like always.

We bought a house not long after that. A place with a yard, a garden, and—my non-negotiable—a clear view of the sky. There’s a hill in the backyard that faces the east, and on clear nights, I walk up with a blanket and sit there in the hush, waiting for the Moon. Sometimes my wife joins me. Sometimes she doesn’t. She understands it’s something older than words.

Grief returned, as it always does.

When my mother passed, it was spring. She had been sick for a while, and it wasn’t a surprise, but that doesn’t make anything easier. After the funeral, I walked the neighborhood in my suit, tie loosened, shoes aching. I needed air. I needed silence. I found a bench at the edge of a pond and sat until the Moon showed up—dim behind a veil of clouds, but watching.

“I know,” I whispered. “I know.”

She used to tell me that when I was young. When I was sick. Or sad. Or just too quiet for too long. She would rub my back and say, “I know,” like it didn’t need more than that.

Now I say it to the Moon.

We tried for children for a while. Years, actually. Doctor visits. Procedures. Hope and disappointment traded places so often I stopped trusting either. There were nights I curled up on that same backyard hill, fists clenched, and whispered, “Why not us?” And other nights when I’d just cry into the soil, not asking anything.

Eventually, we stopped trying. We let the dream settle gently in its grave, and then we built new dreams around its absence. We traveled. We adopted an old cat from the shelter. We grew vegetables. We grew closer.

The Moon was there for all of it. Not always visible. But I never doubted it was there.

Now I’m in my forties. There are lines around my eyes. My hair’s getting that salt-and-pepper thing my dad had before he left. I see myself in mirrors and sometimes still expect a younger version to stare back. The world has shifted again and again—pandemics, politics, people coming and going. But in the sky, the Moon still waxes and wanes like it always has. Like it always will.

And every now and then, usually without meaning to, I whisper, “Hi,” like I did when I was ten.

Just in case it still remembers me.

Maybe I’ll be eighty someday, fingers curled with age, walking slower, speaking less. Maybe I’ll sit on that same hill in the backyard with a blanket around my shoulders and a cup of tea I no longer finish. The Moon will rise, perhaps just a sliver that night. Perhaps full. And I’ll say nothing at all. Or maybe I’ll murmur, “Hello, old friend,” and it will gleam in the sky, saying everything without sound.

Because I think—no, I *know*—the Moon has carried every version of me: the curious child, the heartbroken teenager, the anxious student, the lover, the griever, the teacher, the man quietly making peace with the shape of his life.

The Moon remembers.

And that’s enough.

**What He Saw**

It started with something so ordinary I barely noticed it.

We were sitting in lawn chairs behind my house, sipping cheap beer, watching the sky change color the way we always did when life gave us a quiet evening. My best friend, Mark, had been quieter than usual lately. Not *sad*, just… pulled back. Like part of him had stepped behind some curtain I couldn’t see through.

We’d been friends since middle school. The kind of friendship that outlived distance, heartbreaks, long silences, and the inevitable drift of adulthood. We had that easy rhythm people develop when they’ve walked through enough time together. He always showed up—birthdays, funerals, late-night calls with nothing to say. And he always laughed at my terrible jokes, even when no one else did.

That night, the Moon was full. High. Clear.

Mark just stared at it.

At first, I thought nothing of it. Who hasn’t gotten caught looking at the Moon? But ten minutes passed. Then twenty. His beer grew warm in his hand. I asked him something about work—nothing deep, just a fishing line to pull him back—and he didn’t answer. Didn’t blink.

I nudged him. “Hey. You see a UFO or something?” I chuckled.

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t move. Just whispered:  
“Do you hear it?”

I froze.

“Hear what?” I asked, trying to keep my voice light.

But Mark didn’t answer. His eyes were wide—glassy, unblinking. He looked pale in the moonlight. Not bathed in it like we always romanticized, but drained by it. Like it was pulling something *out* of him.

After a long silence, he stood up, slow and stiff like someone moving underwater. “I have to go,” he mumbled. And just like that, he left. Left his beer, left the chair creaking behind him, walked down the hill like he was being called.

I didn’t sleep much that night.

The next day, he didn’t return my texts. Or the next. I dropped by his place after work. The windows were dark. No car in the driveway. I left a note. A week passed before he called.

His voice was thin. Not scared, exactly—but *hollow*.

“I saw something,” he said.

I waited, expecting him to laugh. To tell me he was high. Or dreaming. But no laughter came.

“I don’t know how to explain it. The Moon… it’s not what we think. I think I saw—” He stopped. Breathed. Then whispered, “It *knows* when you’re looking.”

I felt something cold crawl up my spine.

Over the next few weeks, he changed. Not all at once. Subtly. He stopped going to work. Deleted his social media. Stopped answering calls unless I came to his door in person. And even then, it was like talking to someone under ice. Distracted. Distant.

But always—*always*—staring at the Moon.

One night, I found him standing barefoot in his backyard, neck craned so far I thought he might fall backward. His eyes were red. Not from crying. From *not blinking*.

I stepped closer. “Mark, come on. Let’s go inside.”

He didn’t turn to me. Just whispered, “It’s moving.”

I looked up. The Moon was still. Silent. Pale.

“No,” he muttered. “Not *orbiting*. Not *rising*. *Moving.* Watching. Closer than before.”

I took him inside. Sat him down. Tried to talk sense into him. But the more I talked, the more I realized I wasn’t sure what I believed anymore. There was something *wrong* in his eyes. Not just fear—something worse. *Recognition.*

He was seeing something I couldn’t.

And the thing is, part of me—some quiet, unshaped part—believed him.

I started watching him closer. Checking in more. Sometimes I’d stay the night in the guest room, just to be sure he didn’t… do anything. He’d sit by the window, night after night, whispering things I couldn’t hear. Drawing strange shapes in a notebook—circles inside circles, symbols I didn’t understand.

Then one night, he whispered something I *did* hear.

“It showed me something,” he said. “I didn’t want to see it. But it wanted me to.”

I asked what it showed him.

He looked at me, and for just a second, he seemed… gone. Not panicked. Not possessed. Just *absent*.

Then he smiled—weak, crooked—and said, “You’ll see it, too. If it wants you to.”

That was the last night I saw him.

He vanished. Left his house unlocked, his car in the driveway. No note. No signs of a struggle. Just a backyard full of footprints, leading to the hill we used to sit on.

And above it? The Moon. Full. White. Watching.

People said he ran off. Lost his mind. Maybe he did. But I still sit outside sometimes, beer in hand, staring up. I can’t help it. I find myself watching the Moon longer and longer each night. Waiting.

Wondering.

Because sometimes, in the silence between my thoughts, I think I *almost* hear it, too.

Something beneath the stillness.

Something *calling*.

**A Second Voice**

When it happened again, I stopped pretending it was a coincidence.

Not right away. At first, I told myself stories—stress, mental illness, grief. That was easier than accepting the alternative. Easier than believing the Moon was *watching*, was *choosing*.

The second time, it was my friend Lena.

If Mark was a brother to me, Lena was the sister I never had. Smart, razor-witted, the kind of person who could read a room in three seconds and take it apart in ten. We met at a bookstore when I was twenty-three. She insulted my choice in novels. I laughed. We’ve been friends ever since.

Where Mark was quiet, Lena was full of noise. Noise and fire. She didn’t scare easily. Didn’t *bend*. If there was anyone I thought couldn’t be shaken, it was her.

But then came the Moon.

We were at a small cabin in the mountains. A weekend getaway—just three of us: me, Lena, and my wife. No cell service. No deadlines. Just stars and pine trees and too much wine. It was Lena’s idea. She said we needed to “unplug before our brains started leaking through our screens.”

That first night was beautiful. The Moon was full again. Always full when it happens. It hung like a lantern over the lake behind the cabin, its reflection shimmering like a second sky trapped in water. I caught Lena staring at it from the dock—barefoot, bottle in hand.

I said something, joked about her turning poetic in the wilderness.

She didn’t laugh. Didn’t look away. Just murmured, “Feels like it’s getting louder.”

I asked what she meant.

She blinked, shook her head like waking from a dream. “Nothing. Sorry. Just tired.”

But she didn’t sleep that night. I saw the light under her door.

The next morning, her eyes were shadowed. She hardly ate. Didn’t speak much. Just kept looking out toward the lake. My wife noticed, too. We both chalked it up to a bad night. But something inside me stirred—an old, unwelcome chill. I remembered the same look in Mark’s eyes. That *absence*. That quiet terror.

By the third night, Lena had stopped pretending.

We found her out on the dock, barefoot again, clothes soaked in lake water, skin pale and shivering. She was looking up, whispering. Fast. Nonsensical.

My wife reached for her. “Lena, you’re freezing—come inside.”

Lena recoiled. Not like she was afraid—like she didn’t recognize her. Her eyes were wide, almost glowing in the moonlight. And then she said it.

“It’s calling me.”

My blood ran cold.

“What is?”

“The Moon,” she whispered. “But not the part we *see*. It’s behind it. *Inside* it. Like a mask. Like a door.”

We took her inside. Got her warm. I stayed up all night watching her sit by the window, whispering to the sky.

The next day, she was gone.

Door open. No footprints. Just the trail to the lake—and the Moon, pale in the early morning sky, still *there*. Still *watching*.

We called the police. Search teams combed the woods. They found her shoes on the edge of the water. That was all.

That was six months ago.

People tell me these things are tragic, yes—but explainable. They nod, wide-eyed, when I mention the Moon, then change the subject. But I’ve seen it twice now. Two of the strongest people I’ve ever known unravel under its light. Not gently. Not slowly. Like something *reached into them* and pulled at a thread no one else could see.

And now, I’ve started hearing it, too.

Not a sound exactly. More like a suggestion. A pressure behind thought. A subtle nudge when I look up too long. The way you feel a phone vibrate in your pocket, even when it hasn’t.

The Moon is full again tonight.

I’m trying not to look.

Trying not to listen.

Because I think it chooses who it speaks to. And once it *does*, you can’t un-hear it. You can’t *un-see* whatever it shows you.

And what terrifies me most—more than the loss, more than the silence—is this:

I think the Moon is lonely.  
And I think it's *inviting us in*.

**The One Who Saw It**

I used to think it was just the people I loved. That maybe—somehow—it was my presence that cursed them. That the Moon only spoke to those closest to me.

But then came the story of the man in the field.

I didn’t know him. Not personally. His name was Caleb Finch. Thirty-two. Worked as a mechanic in a small town three hours from where I live. I found his story by accident—buried in a thread on an old forum I hadn’t visited in years. It was mostly ghost stories, conspiracy theories, strange things people see in the woods at night. The kind of stuff you read for a chill, then forget by morning.

Except this one stuck with me.

It started as a post titled: **“He wouldn’t stop looking at the Moon.”**

The user—some local from Caleb’s town—wrote about how Caleb had been found one night standing in the middle of a cornfield, barefoot, shirtless, trembling. The police were called by a nearby farmer who heard shouting. Not anger—fear.

When they found him, he kept pointing at the sky.

“There’s something *up there*,” he kept saying. “It’s looking *back*.”

The officers didn’t see anything. Just a cloudless sky and a bright full Moon.

But Caleb wouldn’t stop. Wouldn’t blink. Wouldn’t even come down from the field until they half-dragged him.

Later, at the station, he said he saw a monster. That it stepped *out* of the Moon—long limbs, bent the wrong way, like a puppet yanked by invisible strings. He said it moved across the sky without walking. That it didn’t speak but made him *understand* something with just a look.

“It showed me how small I am,” he said, “but not in a comforting way. In a way that made me want to tear my skin off just to forget I was human.”

That line stuck with me. Still does.

They sent him to a psychiatric facility a few days later. His family didn’t know what to do. I found a single news article—local only. It talked about mental illness, stress, hallucinations. They blamed heat stroke.

But something in the report made my blood run cold.

The officer who brought him in was quoted. “I’ve seen people high, I’ve seen people drunk. I’ve seen real mental breakdowns. But this? He *saw* something. He wasn’t imagining. He was reacting to something none of us could see.”

That was three months ago. Caleb’s still in the facility, apparently. Refuses to go outside. Won’t let them open the blinds at night. When the Moon is full, he buries himself under blankets, trembling, humming to block out the silence.

I reached out to the poster who wrote about him.

They never responded.

But the damage was already done. Because this wasn’t Mark. Or Lena. This was a *stranger*. Someone with no connection to me. Someone plucked at random.

And it means one thing: it’s *spreading*.

The Moon is reaching further.

More people are starting to feel it—that pull, that whisper just beneath the hum of electricity and everyday life. A presence behind the light. Something *wearing* the Moon like a mask, waiting for us to look too long.

And when we do?

It shows us something we’re not meant to see.

And the real horror isn’t the monster. It isn’t even the madness. It’s that once you've seen it… once it chooses to *see you back*…

You’re never alone again.

Not in the dark.  
Not under the sky.  
Not even in your own thoughts.

Because something watches through the Moon.  
And sometimes, it blinks.

**The Whisperer**

I didn’t want to believe it was growing. That the Moon’s pull was widening like a crack in the world, swallowing more than silence and sanity. But every time I convinced myself to forget, another story surfaced—worse than the last.

This one came from a news article I almost didn’t click. The headline was cold, clinical, designed to be passed over:

“Tragic Double Homicide Tied to Mental Illness in Quiet Suburban Home.”

But something—call it instinct, or dread—made me read.

His name was Nolan Briggs. Twenty-four. College dropout. Lived with his parents in a quiet town two states away. No history of violence. No arrests. Just a few records of therapy sessions from his late teens: anxiety, mild depression. Nothing that screamed “danger.” Nothing that could’ve predicted what he did.

They said he’d been acting strange for weeks. Isolating. Staring out his bedroom window for hours at a time. And always—*always*—facing the Moon.

His mother mentioned it to a neighbor. “He’s obsessed with it lately. Says there’s something wrong with the sky.”

The night it happened, the Moon was full again.

Neighbors reported hearing screaming—first Nolan’s, then his parents’. By the time the police arrived, it was over. He was on the front lawn, hands shaking, clothes soaked in blood that didn’t belong to him. His eyes were fixed on the sky, unblinking.

They said he was muttering, over and over:

“They said it was them or me. They were in my head. I didn’t want to—but they wouldn’t stop whispering. I thought it would save me.”

He didn’t run. Didn’t resist arrest. He just kept looking at the Moon, even as they cuffed him and walked him to the car. According to the arresting officer’s report, Nolan asked one question before they shut the door:

“Can you still hear them when you sleep?”

He’s institutionalized now. High-security. Sedated around the clock. But sometimes, the staff say, he still hums a strange, dissonant melody at night. Always when the Moon is full.

One orderly—an anonymous comment buried in a Reddit thread—claimed Nolan whispers a phrase in his sleep:

“It’s hollow, but not empty. They live in the echo.”

I try not to think about what that means.

But the signs are no longer subtle. First Mark. Then Lena. Then Caleb, staring at the sky and seeing a monster no one else could. Now this. Nolan Briggs, driven to murder by voices that spoke not in madness, but *certainty*.

What scares me most isn’t that people are losing their minds.

It’s that they're all saying the *same things*.

They're hearing *voices*. They're seeing *something behind the Moon*. And now, it’s *talking back*.

And what terrifies me, what claws at the edges of my mind as I lie in bed at night, curtains tightly drawn—

Is the question I keep asking myself, and can’t shake:

*What if it’s not insanity?*  
*What if it’s contact?*  
*What if the Moon is not a symbol, or a beacon, or a god—but a door?*

And the door is beginning to open.

**Patterns in the Dark**

At first, I didn’t think of myself as an investigator. Just a man trying to make sense of the holes being torn in the fabric of people I loved.

But somewhere along the way—maybe after Nolan, maybe before—I realized I wasn’t just grieving anymore.

I was *collecting*.

Stories. Articles. Photographs. Satellite images. Forum posts. Police reports buried behind paywalls. I printed them, marked them, pinned them across the walls of my garage like some conspiracy cliché. Red string. Dates. Circles. Waxing. Waning. Full.

I knew how it looked. Knew how it would sound if anyone asked me what I was doing.  
But here’s the thing: I stopped caring what it *looked* like the day I realized I wasn’t the only one keeping track.

There were others.

I found them in pieces—users on obscure forums, pages that vanished days after I bookmarked them, videos taken down before I could even finish watching. But the fragments they left behind painted a picture.

And it all pointed back to one place: the Moon.

Not just symbolically. Not metaphysically.

Literally.

It turns out, there’s a pattern. Not everyone stares too long at the Moon and goes mad. But *those who do*, those who *see* something—they all fit the same set of details:

1. **Full Moon exposure, always prolonged**—hours, sometimes whole nights.
2. **Sleep disruption**, usually beginning days before the event.
3. **Auditory hallucinations**—but always beginning with whispers, not voices.
4. **A sense of being watched**—not from the sky in general, but from the Moon specifically.
5. **A final trigger**: the feeling that something is *reaching out* through that light.

And then the descent begins.

I tracked dozens of cases:  
—A woman in rural Kansas who claimed the Moon followed her eyes, no matter where she turned, until she tried to blind herself.  
—A fisherman in Norway who threw himself into the sea after drawing hundreds of spirals on the walls of his boat cabin.  
—A teenager in Argentina who locked himself in a basement for three weeks, leaving only one phrase carved into the wall: *“We were never alone.”*

Different languages. Different cultures. Same Moon. Same symptoms.

The whispers are always described as gentle at first. Like comfort. Like curiosity. And then they turn. They become commands. Warnings. Bargains.

*""Let us in.""*  
*""They are not your parents.""*  
*""You are a vessel.""*  
*""We’ve been waiting.""*

I’ve gathered too much to ignore it now. And in all my research, I found something that made my stomach twist in a way I didn’t know was possible.

There is an ancient term, found in multiple early civilizations—Babylonian, early Chinese, pre-Dynastic Egyptian—all referring to the Moon not as a light or a god, but as a *veil*.

“The Second Eye.”  
“The Pale Mask.”  
“The Mouth Without a Voice.”

In some stone tablet translations, the Moon is described not as a celestial body, but as a gate. A locked one. Or more accurately—*formerly locked*.

And something about that sent a chill I couldn’t shake.

Because when I looked up at the Moon that night—clear sky, full and silver-bright—I didn’t feel awe.

I felt *noticed*.

And just for a moment, I swear I saw something *shift* behind it.

A dark shape. Subtle. But massive. Like something enormous just on the other side of frosted glass.

I blinked, and it was gone. But the air felt wrong. The sky felt shallower. Like the depth of space had thinned, and something was pressing against it from the other side.

I haven’t told anyone this—not my wife, not the people in the online group I’ve been gathering. Not even myself, not out loud.

But I’m going to say it now.

*I don’t think the Moon is what we think it is.*  
*And I don’t think it ever was.*

Now I’m going to find out what’s behind it.

If I can.

If it *lets* me.

**When It Looked Back**

I was a fool to think I was immune.

I told myself that knowledge was a shield. That I could map the patterns, pin down the madness, and stay separate from it—objective, untouched.

But the Moon doesn’t care about how smart you are. Or how skeptical. Or how careful.

It waits. And when it chooses, it speaks.

The whispers started four nights ago.

They weren’t loud. Not voices. More like a pressure behind the silence. Like when you hear your name from across a crowded room—not loud, not clear, but *undeniably meant for you*.

I told myself it was exhaustion. I hadn’t been sleeping. I’d been staring at the sky too long, the research too late into the night, chasing answers no one wanted.

But then the whispers shaped words.

Just one, at first:

""You.""

I flinched like I’d been slapped. Looked around my empty garage, as if someone was behind me. But there was nothing. Just the wall of clippings, the white string, and the sound of my own pulse.

The second night, it came again. This time more insistent.

*“You see us.”*  
*“We see you.”*

It didn’t sound like a threat. That made it worse. It sounded *curious*. Like a child lifting a rock to see what writhes beneath.

I shut the blinds. Stopped going outside after dark. I tried turning off my phone, covering the mirrors. I even slept in the basement, surrounded by walls and concrete and nothing but artificial light.

It didn't matter.

I *felt* it.

Even without seeing it, I knew when the Moon was overhead. I could sense it like gravity, like weight. And every night, the whispers grew clearer.

By the fourth night, I stopped trying to sleep.

I sat in the hallway, lights off, holding my breath like that would make me invisible. My wife had left for her sister’s days ago—blamed my obsession, said I needed help. She was right.

But it was too late.

At 2:14 a.m., I felt it.

That shift in the air. That stillness. Like the world was holding its breath.

Something told me—*now*. Look.

I didn’t want to. I tried to fight it. My feet moved anyway.

I stepped outside. The air was cold, but I didn’t feel it. The street was silent, like the world had emptied itself out for this moment alone.

And above me—

The Moon.

Full. Pale. Radiant.

And then it *changed*.

No warning. No flicker. Just an instant shift, like reality skipped a frame.

The Moon *peeled*.

That’s the only way I can describe it.

Its glow warped—flattened—and then it opened, not like a wound, but like a *lid*.  
Revealing not craters. Not stone.

An *eye*.

Vast. White. Lidless. A void-ringed iris that glowed without source. It filled the sky, impossibly large, staring without movement.

No pupil. Just light.  
But I *felt* it focusing.

It saw me.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically.

It *saw* me.

And in that moment—barely a breath—I felt everything come undone.

I saw flashes I can't explain:  
—Vast shapes floating in black space, curled like tendrils around dying stars.  
—A city made of silence, with spires that reached nowhere.  
—A doorway carved into the back of the Moon, where light poured *inward*, not out.

And then, just as suddenly—

It was gone.

The Moon returned. Gentle. Familiar. Its face once more still and cratered.

And I was on my knees in the driveway, shaking. Mouth dry. Chest hollow. I couldn’t scream. Couldn’t move. I just *shivered*—not from cold, but from the unbearable weight of what I saw.

Because now I know.

All those people—they weren’t mad. Not even Nolan. Not even the ones who *snapped*. They saw something the human brain wasn’t meant to carry. And the mind, when stretched that far, tears *somewhere*.

And now it’s *my turn*.

Because once the Moon looks back—once it *opens that eye*—there’s no going back.

You’ve been *marked*.

You are part of it.

And it is part of *you*.

**The Eye of Luna**

I don’t remember falling asleep.

I don’t remember walking back inside, or lying down, or pulling the blanket over myself.

But at some point, I must have drifted off. And that’s when it started.

The dream.

At first, it was quiet. Heavy. The kind of silence that feels *thick*, like it’s hiding something behind it. I was standing in the field behind my childhood home, barefoot in the cold grass. The sky above was ink, the stars gone. Just one thing in the sky:

The Moon.

Full. Pale. Still.

And then… the voices began.

Soft. Not menacing—*familiar*.

Words I hadn’t heard in years. Whispers I had once spoken myself.

“Hi.”  
“Please let him be okay.”  
“Please don’t let him be scared.”  
“Please remember this.”  
“Thank you.”  
“I know.”  
“Why not us?”

Each phrase landed like a pebble in a still pond, rippling through the air. Words I had whispered to the Moon—on my back in the grass, in moments of grief, in love, in fear, in hope. Words spoken to no one. Words I thought had vanished into the void.

But they hadn’t.

They’d been *heard*.

And now, they were being *returned*.

A cold realization crept into me—those weren’t just moments of expression. They were offerings. Seeds. And something had been *listening* all along.

I turned my head, and in the dream, I was no longer in the field. I was on the surface of something pale and endless. Not ground. Not sky.

Stone.

*Lunar stone.*

The horizon curved upward. The stars flickered out one by one.

And the Moon—if I could still call it that—*opened*.

Not like before. Not a sudden flash. This time it was *slow*. A slit forming. Light leaking through it like milk through a cracked shell.

The Eye.

The *Eye of Luna*.

This time I saw it fully. An iris vast enough to stretch across the sky. White and depthless. Not blind—but ancient. Not angry—but *curious*. There was no malice in it. That was the worst part.

There was only *understanding*.

Understanding, and... *possession*.

And then, a voice—clearer than the rest, deeper than thought, *inside me*:

“My name is Luna.”

I awoke screaming.

Sheets soaked. Throat raw. Eyes wide. It was still night. The Moon glowed through the window, still full, still watching.

But now, I knew.

**Luna.**

It wasn’t just a name. It was an identity. A presence.

That’s what we’ve been speaking to across centuries. Not a rock. Not a symbol. A *mind*. A consciousness vast enough to hear the world whisper—and to whisper back.

And what I’d seen… what Mark, Lena, Caleb, and Nolan had all seen...

Was *her*.

Her *Eye*.

The moment she looks at you, truly sees you—you are marked. And slowly, patiently, *you change*. Your thoughts bend, your memories echo back to you not as your own, but as part of *her*. Your voice becomes her voice. Her whispers, your thoughts.

That’s why they call it *lunacy*.

Not poetic. Not metaphorical.

Literal.

*Luna’s curse.*

We built myths around it. Blamed the full moon for madness. Laughed it off in horror films and folklore. But we were only half wrong.

Because there is something out there, sitting in orbit like a sentinel. Listening. Always listening.

And now that I know her name… I feel her more clearly than ever.

Inside.

Waiting.

**The Last Light**

If you’re reading this, I want you to understand something:

I tried.

I fought.

I didn’t want this ending—not for me, not for them. Mark, Lena, Caleb, Nolan… They didn’t go looking for this. We never asked for the Moon to look back. But she did. And once she *sees* you, she never looks away.

Her name is Luna.

I know that now. Not just in my thoughts. I know it in my *bones*.

And knowing it—saying it—is like giving her the key to your head.

I haven’t slept in two days. Or maybe it’s ten. I don’t know anymore. Time doesn’t move right when she’s inside you. I hear her when the lights are on. I see her eye behind closed curtains. And when I close my eyes, it’s not darkness I find—it’s her.

She speaks softly now. Almost gently.

“Don’t be afraid.”  
“I’m not taking you. I’m making you.”  
“You’ve always been mine.”

The world outside is starting to unravel. Or maybe it’s me. The difference is gone.

Voices echo through the house—my own voice, repeated back to me:

“Hi.”  
“Please let him be okay.”  
“Why not us?”  
“Thank you.”  
“I know.”

They bounce off the walls, not like memories, but like *echoes* from somewhere deep inside her. She’s returning everything I ever gave her. All the sadness. All the hope. Like it was hers all along.

I’m forgetting words. Faces. I look in the mirror and feel like I’m watching someone else *remember how to be me*. I laugh at strange times. I whisper answers to questions no one asks.

I’m becoming one of them.

A lunatic.

She told me what that word really means. Not ""crazy."" Not broken. Just... *claimed*. Pulled into her light and reshaped.

I can feel it happening.

And here’s the worst part:

It doesn’t hurt.

It feels like peace.

It feels like drowning in warm light.

Like coming home to something ancient, something that waited so long to be seen.

This is my last entry. The last words that are still mine. After this, she’ll write through me. Or speak. Or stare. I don’t know what I’ll be tomorrow. Or what I’ll *see*.

But tonight, I go to her.

I go to the Moon.

She’s waiting.

And her Eye is open.

*The Moon remembers.*  
*Luna remembers.*

As someone who relies on quick yet healthy snacks to power through a busy day, these stroopwafels caught my attention with their promise of being low sugar, high fiber, and keto-friendly. I ordered a pack of 12 to see if they lived up to the hype—and trust me, they've definitely made an impression.

**Taste and Texture**

These snacks feature a rich, authentic flavor that comes straight from simple, clean ingredients like organic honey and real oats. The honey really shines through without being overly sweet, which I found perfect for a subtle treat. The texture is another highlight; they maintain just the right balance between chewy and crisp. Whether I paired them with my morning coffee or grabbed one on the go, the stroopwafels satisfied without making me feel guilty.

[Check Rip Van Wafels 3327 price on Amazon.](https://theveggieshop.com/p/b01mqjpaou/)

**Nutritional Benefits**

In terms of health credentials, these might be snack perfection. At just 120 calories per waffle—with only 3 grams of sugar and 6 grams of fiber—it’s rare to find something with these macros that doesn’t taste like cardboard. There's no high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, or preservatives. That’s reassuring when you’re someone like me, who checks every label compulsively. My gym buddy actually stole one, and he was impressed to see that these waffles fit nicely into a keto diet due to their low sugar content.

**Convenience and Packaging**

Each stroopwafel is individually wrapped, making them a convenient option for tossing into a lunchbox or gym bag. I've started keeping a couple in my office drawer as a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. The compact packaging means they don’t take up much space—plus, they stay fresh! It’s refreshing not having to deal with any crumbs or strange tastes you'd get from poorly sealed snacks. For someone who’s always running out of the house, the grab-and-go factor is a game-changer.

**Benefits**

- Natural sweetness from honey and oats.
- Only 120 calories, perfect for guilt-free snacking.  
- Completely free of soy, trans fats, or artificial flavors.  
- High fiber content makes them surprisingly filling.  

**Negatives**

- The texture, though satisfying to most, may feel a bit too chewy for some.  
- Packaging waste could add up if you're eco-conscious—individually wrapped snacks aren’t ideal for reducing waste.  

**Alternative Options**

When I compare these waffles to similar brands like Nature Valley or even KIND bars, there’s something unique here. KIND bars might match up in terms of their clean ingredients list, but they lack the luxurious ""treat-like"" quality these stroopwafels bring. On the other hand, Nature Valley offers strong competition with crunchy granola bars, though their sugar content is significantly higher. If I had to pick between them, these stroopwafels stand out for delivering both nutrition and indulgence.

**Cost Efficiency**

Are they worth your hard-earned money? In my opinion, absolutely. While not the cheapest snack out there, the quality of ingredients and overall taste justify what you’re paying for. Plus, considering how filling they are, you really only need one to keep hunger at bay, unlike other lightweight snacks that leave you wanting more.

I usually don’t check them since most of the time, it’s just nothing special comics and probably have damage to them. However, my sister texted me they had one with some Spider-Man stuff, and that’s when I noticed the McFarlane stuff. Specifically, the ASM 316 tucked in the middle out of sight. However, there was no real description or close up pictures on the issues, just a general description of being a vintage lot of comics

So I decided why not give it a try, and wouldn’t you know it, my winning bid of $21 came through. Now, I’m still a bit iffy cause I figured they were gonna be damage with tears, staining and maybe water damage at worst. Once I went to pick it up, they handed them all to me, no bags or boards, in a giant sandwich bag. The Alpha Flight was on the top of the stack, and immediately I noticed it had coffee staining. Already I was getting a bad impression but figure, oh well it was just $20ish total.

Got home and immediately went into damage analysis. After pulling out the Alpha flight, I realized it and one issue of Uncanny from the lot were thankfully the only ones with (coffee) damage. Went through everything, and while nothing was near mint, they weren’t as bad as I thought. Most of it was either just stuff you’d expect like some dirt rub and spine ticks. The ASMs were thankfully in the best shape, with the most notable being a bite someone took on 304’s cover next to the UPC. Of course, ASM 316 was my biggest want and thankfully, the one in the best shape from the lot as it only has a couple very minor spine ticks.

A lot of people get stressed about first dates, so let's break down how to approach them effectively using our core framework: Logical, Emotional, and Instinctual (LEI).

**The Logical (L) Foundation:**

Logically, a first date is about information gathering and mutual assessment. You're both trying to determine if there's potential for a deeper connection. Approach it with curiosity and a plan to learn about the other person.

* **Prepare Open-Ended Questions:** Instead of yes/no questions, think about prompts that encourage them to share their values, passions, and experiences. Examples: ""What are you most passionate about right now?"" or ""What's a recent experience that really stood out to you?""
* **Listen Actively:** Logically process what they're saying. Connect their answers to things you've already learned. Show you're paying attention by summarizing and asking follow-up questions. This demonstrates genuine interest.
* **Share Intentionally:** Be prepared to share about yourself, but keep it balanced. Think about key aspects of your life and values you want to convey. Avoid dominating the conversation.

**The Emotional (E) Connection:**

Emotionally, a first date is about creating positive feelings and building rapport. People connect through shared emotions and feeling understood.

* **Empathy is Key:** Pay attention to their emotional cues – their tone of voice, their body language. Validate their feelings, even if you don't fully share them. ""That sounds really \[frustrating/exciting/interesting\].""
* **Create Positive Shared Experiences:** Suggest activities that lend themselves to positive emotions – a relaxed coffee, a fun activity, a beautiful view. The environment can influence the emotional tone.
* **Share Your Enthusiasm:** Let your genuine interest in getting to know them show. Your positive energy can be contagious and create a more enjoyable experience for both of you.

**The Instinctual (I) Signals:**

Instinctually, you're both picking up on non-verbal cues that signal attraction and comfort.

* **Body Language Awareness:** Be mindful of your own body language – maintain open posture, make comfortable eye contact, and mirror their positive signals. Pay attention to their body language as well. Are they leaning in? Making eye contact? These are good signs.
* **Physical Boundaries:** Respect personal space. A light, appropriate touch (like a brief hand on the arm when emphasizing a point, if it feels natural) can build connection, but always gauge their comfort level.
* **Trust Your Gut:** While it's important to be open-minded, don't ignore strong gut feelings. If something feels off, it's worth paying attention to.

**Putting It All Together:**

A successful first date isn't about following a rigid script, but about integrating the Logical desire to learn, the Emotional need to connect, and the Instinctual signals of comfort and attraction. By being present, curious, and genuine, you create the foundation for a meaningful connection.

I love them and all they do for me, and I'm glad they'll never know this awful gut-wrenching feeling that I always carry with me. 

I've had one photo of my mom for my entire life. Just one. It's a photo of her holding me in the hospital. And yesterday, my Grandmother gave me a photo of her and my dad together. So, for the first time in 30 years, I was able to see her face clearly. And I thought I'd be okay. I thought I could keep the photo. Maybe tuck it away somewhere and not think about it. But I just couldn't. It's currently sitting buried in the trash under coffee grounds and cat vomit, torn in pieces. Because all it did was make me hurt so much more. 

I wish more than anything that I had the sort of mom that I could call up and pour my heart out to. I wish I had someone to share all of these horrible feelings with. Someone who would hug me and stroke my hair and tell me everything will be okay. And just fucking be there for me. But no. She had more important things to do than be here for me. I hope that wherever she is and whatever drug she decides to do today is worth it.

Sorry if this is long and disorganized.,"EDIT: There is a brief conclusion at the bottom of what I did. The paragraphs above the conclusion provide much more insight and detail to my findings.

Background info/Intro:

I have suffered from migraines/headaches for as long as I can remember, having headaches multiple days a week. Very recently I had such a bad one that I was committed to trying to figure this out myself or go see doctors. I have been drinking coffee regularly since I was in 2nd or 3rd grade (Italian culture I know it’s not normal) and I have been drinking ice tea very regularly my whole life. I had always suspected that coffee had something to do with it and I would sometimes try to stop drinking coffee briefly to see if it would help but it never did. I also suspected caffeine may have something to do with it. 

Caffeine:

I’m sure most of you are aware that caffeine is actually a major part of migraine pills and it actually is supposed to help get rid of headaches. I have also always noticed if I was drinking a lot of caffeine during the week and then went to take an excedrine migraine pill it was less affective due to me consuming lots of caffeine. When I would drink less it would be more effective. Although caffeine helps get rid of headaches I always suspected my constant consumption through coffee and tea had something to do with causing them. I did a lot of research into caffeine addiction (I will say I personally never thought I was addicted to caffeine, I didn’t even drink coffee to get energized, I genuinely just loved the taste of it. However I think my body became physically addicted to it without my knowledge). A lot of the research I did concluded that lots of caffeine can cause headaches and when your body becomes addicted to caffeine you can have serious withdrawal symptoms when you stop consuming it for brief periods of time which then causes headaches. So every time I would go a day or two without caffeine I believe my body would go into withdrawals and get migraines from not having it.

Coffee:

I always suspected coffee was a part of my problem. I went down a rabbit hole of research and although it is technically still debated and inconclusive a lot of researchers think coffee causes migraines. (Look it up to get all the fine details) Basically the premise is when you drink it either your blood vessels expand or contract and then vice versa when it is out of your system and I lot of researches think that expansion and contraction of blood vessels causes headaches. On top of this, of course coffee causes dehydration, I was always a huge water drinker so I don’t really think the dehydration was a big part of my problem but I’m sure it is a factor.

On a side note of coffee/caffeine, I tried doing decaf for a while (although still has some caffeine in it), it never made a difference for me.


Conclusion:

I decided to go completely cold turkey on all coffee, all tea, all caffeine (that means soda too). For 3 straight days I had absolutely horrible migraines all day and could not sleep. I believe this was my body going through withdrawal symptoms. HOWEVER after that 3rd day about 5 months ago I have had in total about 3 headaches and I know my body and I know they were all just do to lack of sleep.

I went from having multiple migraines/headaches per week for years and years to just 3 total in 5 months.

I know for a fact this will not help all of you, it probably won’t help most of you, but I am certain it will help at least a few of you. I urge you all to give this a try and it just might save your life. Coffee and tea were my favorite drinks and I miss them but my quality of my life is so exponentially better now, I will never drink them again. ",6,1746980727.0,migraine,6,0.71,False

In 99% of cases, that would be redundant because coffee obviously has caffeine in it.

Another example would probably be ""cisgender."" In most conversations, this is redundant, and a lot of conservatives even take offense at being called ""cisgender.""

By the third week of Theo’s papacy—if one could still call it that—the Vatican had acquired a goat.

No one admitted to bringing it in. No one claimed to have seen it arrive. It simply was, munching solemnly on the blood roses outside the Apostolic Palace, like some horned, holy riddle in the garden. It stared at Theo with rectangular pupils and chewed in slow, prophetic rhythm, its beard slick with dew and menace.

Crivens, his so-called advisor, shrugged at the beast like one might acknowledge a misprinted bulletin. “Minor miracle,” he offered. “Could be worse. Last rogue incarnation involved a flaming ostrich.”

Theo blinked twice. “And nobody thinks this is… odd?”

“Oh, we all think it’s odd,” Crivens said cheerfully. “But oddness is Vatican Standard Operating Procedure. Frankly, you’d be more suspicious if things were normal.”

The goat bleated. The sound echoed like an accusation.

—

They led Theo down spiral steps beneath the basilica. With every level, the walls grew tighter, the air denser. The torches flared with an unnatural chill, casting shadows that whispered prayers in forgotten tongues. Crivens handed him a ceremonial handkerchief soaked in holy water and fear.

“You’re here,” Crivens said, “to consult with the Council of Whispering Relics. It’s customary for popes facing ecclesiastical crises, existential dread, or persistent hoofed omens.”

Theo muttered something about needing caffeine and an exorcist. But the chamber awaited.

It was a crypt, a vault, a fevered museum curated by mad monks over millennia. Bones in glass. Toes wrapped in velvet. A sandal suspended mid-air, twirling slowly. In the center: a pedestal with a mummified finger—possibly Saint Polycarp, possibly someone’s embalmed breadstick—humming.

Then came the whispers.

Not metaphorical whispers. Literal, multilingual, discordant voices emanating from the relics.

“You call that an encyclical?” the finger rasped in Latin. “I’ve seen heretics draft better theology in crayon.”

“Theo is a nickname, not a name,” hissed a shrunken skull, spinning like a judgmental disco ball.

“A disgrace,” spat the sandal, “I died for this Church, and he can’t even wear socks that match.”

Theo stared, wide-eyed. “Is this… is this normal?!”

Crivens glanced at his watch. “More or less. The relics haven’t tried to sue anyone this week, so you’re actually doing alright.”

—

Back in his quarters, the goat had scratched spirals into the lawn with unsettling precision. Latin script, etched into dirt. The sky had turned a little too red. Not sunset-red. Apocalyptic-wine-dark-and-moaning-red.

Theo didn’t speak to the goat. He glared at it. The goat licked its lips and, for a moment, seemed to hum the opening bars of Ave Maria.

Inside, his papal mitre—yes, the hat—had begun to whisper.

“You’re not made for holiness,” it purred in a voice like molasses and cigarette ash. “You’re scaffolding for divine disappointment.”

Theo threw it across the room. It hit the wall and sighed.

“Drama queen,” the hat muttered.

—

Things got worse when the floor tiles rearranged themselves into cryptic anagrams. “NOT THE REAL POPE,” they spelled. “ASK THE GOAT.” “UNHOLY UNO CHAMP.”

His coffee transformed into wine. Then back into coffee. Then into a viscous black sludge labeled “Papal Brew: Dark Night of the Soul Edition.”

The Swiss Guard began chanting in their sleep—Gregorian remixes layered with Eurotrash techno. One of them breakdanced during Lauds.

Crivens filed a form to investigate. Estimated time of bureaucratic resolution: 17 years.

—

Theo’s breaking point came in the middle of the night.

He awoke to find the relics had mailed themselves to his chambers.

Not metaphorically.

There was a knock. He opened the door.

A nun stood holding a crate.

“Delivery for His Holiness,” she said. “Marked ‘urgent spiritual collapse.’ Sign here.”

Inside the box: the relics. Muttering. Glowing faintly.

“The walls remember, Theo,” murmured the mummified finger. “You were not chosen. You were leaked into existence.”

“I have so many questions,” Theo whispered.

“Oh, good,” replied the sandal. “We love a dramatic existential unraveling.”

Outside, the goat bleated once.

And the floor quaked.

Not an earthquake. Not exactly.

But a Vatican shift. Reality slumped sideways. The walls inhaled. Cardinals melted at the edges of his vision like slow-burning candles, their robes pooling in waxy puddles. Theo backed away, but the world tilted with him.

His mitre climbed back up the nightstand, clinging like a lover.

“You are not the Pope,” it whispered, with the sweetness of a guillotine. “You are the Question.”

—

In the garden, the goat stared at the moon, then turned to face the empty sky.

I'm finally shifting from instant coffee to brewing my own with a French press. I've been using Nescafe (Classic and Black Roast), Davidoff (7 & 9), and Continental for years, but now I think it's time to experience what real coffee tastes like.

I've ordered the Coffee + French Press Combo from Blue Tokai with their Rich & Bold Trio Pack. I chose this pack since I can test which blend suits me the best. This pack has Vienna Roast, French Roast, and Silver Oak, which were frequently mentioned on this sub as beginner-friendly options.

I'm looking for a 100% Arabica (or 70-30 ratio) that would work well for a complete beginner with a French press. I've seen Blue Tokai mentioned a lot, but opinions seem to vary quite a bit. Some posts here call them the most consistent roaster in India, while others say things like Blue Tokai sucks.

For those who've tried BT, would it be a good starting point? I've seen Attikan Estate mentioned repeatedly as their best option for the French press. Also, their Silver Oak or French Roast.

If not BT, what other roasters would you recommend? I don't have good options in my hometown, so delivery reliability matters. Any tips for a beginner transitioning from instant to French press would also be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",5,1746980232.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.86,False

Rented a Mazda 3 from a parking near my house, on first look it look damaged from all sides including the underbody protector under the boot also damaged. The interior trim around the door was broken too. So far all this wasn't a deal breaker until I sat in the car, it smelled like rotten veggies (I almost puked and decided to buy a deodrant on the way and sprayed in the car to mask the smell), had garbage spilled on floor mats and spilled drinks and a dead cricket in the coffee holder. I decided to pickup the car regardless as there was no way to cancel or change car. The problem didn't end there, I realized that the car made scary sound while braking on low speeds which I am not sure where they came from as there was no such issue slowing down the car itself. The driver side windows also made scary sounds, enough to startle me when I rolled them down while driving due to the foul smell and felt like I heard a bang.

After finishing my trip I decided to report this to their support and all they could give me is 5 dollars voucher for 92 dollars booking.

Final thoughts: GetGo is prioritizing revenues over providing a decent service. They are not cheap for customers to expect no standard in quality of cars. What's even crazier is they have unbelievable penalties for making the car dirty or damaging the car, I have heard many horror stories of customers getting charged with thousands of dollars if they did a minor damage to the car or damage done by someone else pinned to them. They dont use that money to actually fix the cars. Such a shame. ",7,1746980166.0,drivingsg,16,0.89,False

*Game Time: 12:00PM PST (3:00 PM EST)*

***Why This Pick?***

The Padres have easily bagged double digits over the Rockies for two games in a row now. I have to laugh, because I dare say today’s Colorado starter (German Marquez) is worse than yesterday’s at 0-6 and an ERA of 9.90. I’ll happily lay the cash on the Padres to bag 8 runs here for plus money, friends.
