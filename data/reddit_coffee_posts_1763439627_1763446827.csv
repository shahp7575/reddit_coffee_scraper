Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

• A hobby corner for puzzles, crafts, or board games with a small table

1p04ilj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1p04ilj/slowburn_fulfilled/,Slow-burn Fulfilled,"Every line, every rhythm, every pattern, every habit. Our days went by every single day while we danced the emotional waltz with our emotions and our updates. Now you're gone it lingers like your silhouette waking away from my soul. 

It's no longer necessary to tell you how much I cared about you because you knew and you felt it. It's a demonstration of what it meant to have a slow-burn emotional connection and we sure we're getting quite intimate and vulnerable together as each day passed by. Each other's lines became mood stabilizers before our minds wandered about at a great distance. 

I've always wanted you to feel loved and safe and cherished every single day and to remind you of your inherent worth of being loved for who you are with numerous quotes and a thousand prayers. 

I often mumbled to myself the patterns we have set up with each other, like ""I'm gonna sleep na at work first before going to church later."" Or ""Good night and sleep well! Talk to you tomorrow."" These lines aren't ordinary lines, these lines invite each other to enter into each other's lives bit by bit. 

We started our talk before you vacationed with your sister in Japan for a week and boy I was so excited waiting to hear from you and your updates. Then our talks began to flourish to the point of us vividly describing ourselves to each other and telling each other how similar our life stories are. 

I wanted you to be treated, the best way a lady should be treated, without abuse or love bombing but just simple but pure stability and consistency. The fact that you were NBSB made me even more ambitious in caring for you. I've set a relationship standard so high, so safe, so healthy that it would be incredibly challenging for someone else to meet that standard with you. You deserve the bare maximum. With me being more experienced, I endeavored myself to be your Motto Stella (Guiding Star) like Rizal's monument in Luneta. 

I've shown myself to you, my feelings, my beliefs, my opinions and my experiences every day and I was so comfortable and vulnerable that I never felt such freedom of expression with another human being except for you. You were my most sublime constant and confidant. 

I've always respected your time offline as I never intrude into your business without your consent. Like what you mentioned about being private and reserved in your dating post back then. 

You said to me that you liked talking to me and you appreciate my updates everyday and that I am rare. I took to heart on what you told me here: ""I want you to think of me as your safe space. I want you to be comfortable talking to me.""

Alas, I wish that to remain true but you opted out on the 28th Day of our talking era, 2 days before our scheduled date for some unfinished business with another Redditor from another time. I could tell that you did this for familiarity and out of respect for that guy but I know that what your heart says is conflicted with what your mind says and you're not sure of him.

Now, I don't want you to feel guilty for leaving me even though I've been trying really hard to recover from the loss of this relationship. It pains me to not having you around to talk to and to wait for you to get home after your evening walk. 

I would have held you tight,, taken you home, kiss you on the forehead and listen to you and your stories while sip coffee together and having some deep conversations about life. 

I never took what we had for granted. You are a gorgeous lady with a majestic innocent soul. I would've looked into your eyes just to show you your true worth and how much mean to me. 

You still linger inside me and it has not been easy at all. I miss you so much like the father misses his Prodigal Son. 

Love is a liberator of souls, a choice we make everyday to make someone's life the best well-lived life possible. I have no regrets to carry this heavy and hollow feeling I feel inside me because you were there and you were real. 

If you shall return one day, I will welcome you with open arms and our bond will be ironclad. An encore will be better than the first show. You will always have a place in my life and in my soul and may you stay there for long as you want. We will be home! Cheers to the bare maximum!

Meanwhile I’ve got this rug that I’ve never been totally happy with.

Says to clean drip tray contacts - one solution,"Hi, I have a CVA5060 (similar to CVA4060) that kept telling me to empty the drip tray and clean the contacts, no matter how much I emptied or cleaned. I thought it was a contact issue to the drip tray, but it wasn't. The machine has recorded over 8000 coffees made. But I found the problem.

So I thought I would post this solution if folk have this problem.

That I found after disassembling the rear of the machine, was that over time some coffee grounds fell thru a hole at the rear of the brew unit area and eventually built up on the back of the contacts in the machine that mate with the contacts on the drip tray.

So this caused the machine to think the drip tray contacts were dirty - whereas in fact it was coffee grounds built up (and damp) on the contacts in the machine.

Solution is to unplug and take the machine out, remove the back access panel and using a brush and cleaner remove all the built up grounds around the internal contact points to the drip tray contacts. ITs obvious where it is and there is a bit of a lip that you need to get behind to make sure you getting all the grounds out.

Let it dry and reassemble.

1p04f03,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1p04f03/the_romsey_slasher/,The Romsey Slasher,"It was that time of year again when the leaves were dying and bringing the crowds of people who were from out of town. Romsey is a small, isolated town, and their annual fall festival is the highlight of the year. This year, a dark force lurked in the background. It was plotting and calculating the moves it would make, knowing exactly who its victims would be.

With a mask fitted to their face, they blended in with the cheerful crowds. Laughter drowned the unease, though as night fell, the first victim was found. They took pride in grotesquely displaying their kill like a trophy in the town square. The people of the town began to panic; rumors spread like wildfire. The killer knew that they were afraid and laughed at the feeble attempts to figure out who they were.

Can the townspeople uncover who the masked slasher is?

Or will they become part of the gruesome display in the town square…

Harvey pulled his jacket around himself to shield himself from the cold as he made his way down the driveway of his family home. It had been a while since he had been back in his hometown of Romsey. Harvey wouldn’t have come back if his father hadn’t fallen and hurt his back. When he first received the call, he was thinking the worst, but upon hearing the man’s voice on the other end, he exhaled a sigh of relief. So, Harvey took emergency leave from work to go take care of his father until he got better.

Right now, he was making his way to the local diner down the road to grab some breakfast for himself and his father. Neither one of them was as good of a cook as his late mother, but they cooked what was easy in order to survive. Plus, it had been some time since Harvey had a taste of Julie’s Diner. Walking down the sidewalk, he stopped at the crosswalk, waiting for the light, and went across. The parking lot was semi-packed since it wasn’t the morning rush, pulling open the door, the bell jingled, alerting his presence.

“Well, if it ain’t Thomas’s boy. How have you been, Harvey? Are you dining in or placing a to-go order?” an older woman with a high-top bun on her head greeted with a smile.

“Good to see you too, Julie. A to-go order, please.” Harvey sat down at the island bar and picked up a menu, glossing it over. Julie had been running this place since he was in diapers. Taking over from her father, who passed it down to her after his passing. It hit the town hard when Pop’s, Michael Ringer, died of a heart attack. Julie and her mother ran the diner until she had to place her into a retirement home.

The day he left Romsey was when Harvey heard that Julie lost her mom too.

Placing his order, he looked over at the mounted TV on the wall while he waited. Listening to the local news report detailing a body that had been found in Champions Square. A murder in a town like Romsey? Harvey thought to himself, quirking an eyebrow. It had to be the most surprising news ever since… when the Durlin Bridge went out during a heavy rainstorm. “Hard to believe, isn’t it?” said Julie, her voice low.

“Yeah, it’s quite a surprise.” Harvey agreed. He was starting to think that someone had gotten bored of the peace and quiet Romsey offered. Or they had some sort of grudge against the people here. The order was done, and Julie packed it up for him. Harvey paid the tab and made his way out the door.

Harvey bumped shoulders with someone on the way out and muttered an excuse me before continuing on his way. The stranger watched him leave, studying him inquisitively as if he didn’t expect him to be here in town. Harvey didn’t think much of it as he was used to tourists coming into town. He got home and set up the kitchen for dinner. “Pops, I’m back!” Harvey hollered, setting the takeout on the counter to get down some plates and coffee cups.

They ate breakfast in silence other than the usual small talk. Harvey mentioned what he had heard on the news at Julie’s. His father shook his head, saying that it sounded like a copycat. “What do you mean a copycat?” Harvey asked. “When I was a teenager. If I recall, there was a situation like that. Where people who got near the local park mysteriously ended up dead.” His father replied, taking a sip of his coffee.

Harvey pressed a little further, questioning if they ever caught who did it. His father just shrugged, sipping his coffee. He said that the trail was cold, that whoever did it was good at covering their tracks. What didn’t make sense to Harvey was why this copycat was showing up now, years later? Did they get bored and decide that killing a few people would be good amusement?

Whatever the reason, he had to make sure that his was safe. Since the killer didn’t really have a type of person they were after. Anyone could be a target who entered Champions town square. Should he do a stake-out and see if he could spot someone out of place? Harvey shook his head mentally, kicking himself for thinking something so dangerous.

Cleaning up the kitchen, he washed their dishes as his father retired to the living room. The sound of TV being turned on could be heard in the background. Harvey looked out the window, watching as cars drove by and neighbors walked down the sidewalk. They were on their way to the corner store or taking the family pet on a walk. He felt deep down that Romsey would never be the same, and that this first murder was just the start.

The following morning, Harvey took his father to his doctor’s appointment. Halfway to their destination, there was a traffic stop set up. His father mumbled under his breath about how ridiculous this all was. Harvey had disagreed, however, because this killer seemed to have struck again. Just who had this person chosen as their victim this time?

Harvey rolled his window down to talk to the officer who instructed them to stop. He began fishing his ID and registration out of his wallet. Handing it over along with his father’s, the officer looked it over, eyeing Harvey with suspicion. “Is this your son, Thomas?” the officer asked. “Yeah, this is Harvey. Last time you saw him, he was knee-high.” Thomas laughed.

The officer nodded, handing back over the IDs and registration. “Be careful at night if you have to go out,” he warned. Then, he motioned for them to go ahead and move forward. Driving past the town square, where they were busy cleaning up the mess, Harvey glanced over. To his horror, the person being loaded onto the gurney was Julie Ringer. He had just seen her yesterday… was the killer just choosing whoever they felt deserved to die?

Harvey hoped that his father hadn’t seen what he had. It would have quite the impact on him, considering he had known each other for a long time. The appointment went well, with his father being told that the next step would be physical therapy. Thomas was healing as he should and without complications. At least his father wouldn’t need any surgery on his knee.

Later that night, Thomas had gotten a call from some of Julie’s family to break the news to him. Harvey had been the one to answer it, confirming what he had seen earlier. “Who was that on the phone?” Thomas questioned from his recliner in the living room. “That was some of Julie’s family…. they uh found her body this morning in Champions Square.” Harvey cleared his throat, making his way back to the living room head down.

Thomas paled, turning his head to look back at the TV, tears pricking at the edges of his eyes. “Harvey, have a seat. I need to tell you about what happened back in 1978,” said his father, motioning to the couch. His father muted the tv and rubbed his sore knee and began to tell his story. When he was about eighteen, there had been a string of murders that happened in Emerald Park. The police didn’t have any leads, and since there wasn’t any evidence left behind.

The killer would put the deceased into a sitting position; hands folded in their lap and eyes closed. As if they were taking a nap and would be waking up any time. Probably reveling in all of the reactions they were getting when people realized that the person they were trying to wake up was dead. First it was Thomas’s older sister, and then Julie’s mother a month later. The killer was calculated, never picking similar victims with each kill and never more than one victim at a time.

Those murders went unsolved, and after a year, they just stopped. Now something similar was happening again. Except this copycat was killing more than one person and changing the location. Even the position of the bodies was arranged in an unusual way compared to the previous killer. Flat on their back, legs together, and hands over their closed eyes.

Not even a speck of blood anywhere. For the longest time, they thought it had to be someone with medical knowledge. Because when they examined the bodies, all of the blood had been drained. Not a single scar left behind to indicate where the blood had been taken from. For the longest time, people swore whoever it was must be a vampire, a cultist, or a black-market dealer.

Honestly, it didn’t matter how many theories they tossed around; it didn’t help with the fact that people were being killed. Thomas continued explaining that he once stayed up late at night watching the park. Waiting to see if he could spot who had been bringing the bodies into Emerald Park and setting them up. He was about to call it quits and go home when he saw it. A tall figure was walking through the early morning fog, carrying a body in their arm.

Their complexion was warm sepia, reddish-brown. Tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. When Thomas saw them, they had an eerie glow to them. The figure sat the latest victim up on the bench, placing their hands in their lap. They had said something, but it was in a language he didn’t know.

“Do you remember what they said?” Harvey asked.

Thomas furrowed his brow “Che il tuo sacrificio non sia vano.” he replied.

Harvey leaned back, slumping into the couch. It was Italian for “ may your sacrifice not be in vain.” At least, he was sure. Did it have to do with the blood? Or had other things been taken out of the bodies as well? According to his father, there were no surgical scars when the medical examiner had looked at the bodies.

There was something that was being overlooked. Tomorrow, he would see if he couldn’t get into the morgue to see someone. Harvey had a gut feeling that something was being overlooked. He desperately wanted to get down to the bottom of it. For his father and all of the other past victims who were hard by this.

Morning soon came, and he felt as if he hadn’t slept at all. Going into the small hospital, Romsey had Harvey make the excuse that he was there to ID a body. He didn’t know if any deceased had come in unclaimed, but he was willing to take a shot. The receptionist took a moment and nodded, confirming that there was one unclaimed body. She then instructed him where to go from the reception desk, and he nervously boarded an old, rickety elevator.

As the elevator descended down into the morgue, the lights slightly flickered. Chills made their way down Harvey’s spine. This was beginning to feel like a bad horror movie. The doors creaked open, and he stepped out, making his way down a singular hallway to a set of double doors. There before him was a motionless body underneath a white sheet.

Looking around, he didn’t see anyone around, so he reached out and pulled the sheet down. The face that looked back at him looked familiar to him. Harvey hadn’t seen this person before, but the description of them flooded into his mind. The warm sepia, reddish-brown complexation, and tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. This had to be him, the man that his father told him about the… Romsey Slasher.

Harvey took a step back as the man rose up off the table and began walking towards him. As he backed away, he could feel the door dig into his back. All he had to do was grab the knob and turn it. The man reached out his hand, a hole opening in his palm, and an inky black tentacle slithered out. Harvey let out a gasp, and the tentacle saw its chance, diving down his throat with a sickening gurgle.

Thomas was on his second cup of coffee this morning. Since he hadn’t been able to sleep the previous night, Harvey didn’t come home last night, and Thomas was worried that something had happened to him. Making his way to the living room, he turned on the tv and flipped through the channels. Thomas only stopped when a news flash appeared on the screen.

The new reporter described a young man in his thirties and noted him as a local to the town. When they showed a picture of Harvey, he dropped his coffee cup. It shattered on the ground, spilling its contents mixing with porcelain. Thomas didn’t want to believe it; he didn’t want to believe that his only child had been taken away just like his older sister back then. Thomas gripped the armrests as anger surged through him, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill over.

I mean, shit every day I come home from the gym and shower. And the minute im out of the shower, im met with an amazing breakfast with a coffee that has the exact right amount of creamer in it. I mean, this girl has figured out exact measurements for how much creamer I like in my coffee just to make sure she has it made right for me everyday. I never even asked her to, she just does it cause she wants to. I dont even know how much creamer I put in, I just estimate it. She knows exactly, because she goes out of her way to know these things just cause she wants to. She even knows my own thoughts and emotions better than I do. She can tell exactly how im feeling just from my face or sentences. And shes never once judged me for my feelings, even if its expressed in the form of bawling like a baby cause I just cant handle it all no more. And not once has she ever judged me for this. Instead she goes out of her way to help me feel better, to understand how im feeling and how she can help. 

She wants to spend every minute she can with me, and wants to be a part of my life and for me to be a part of hers in every way possible. Her personality, lifestyle, dreams, and ambitions all compliment my own perfectly...like she truly is my other half

Oh, and on top of just the day to day stuff...the sex? Goddamn...its fucking good

And shit...shes just amazing...and I truly am blessed to have this woman in my life and I dont even deserve it cause I dont even do half as much for her. I show her I love her in my own ways, but I dont do nearly as much as she does and I just dont deserve such an amazing woman in my life, and yet here she is with me.

I opened the scroll. It was my first time in the Azabache (Jet-Black) Library.

What a place. Great vaults of black stone, but veined with gold and jewels. The Empire's entire Goth-Greco-Roman madness in one building.

And who would've thought that for an Empire this hermetic, the main library has been open to the public since its founding?

I focused on the scroll in front of me. It was absurd, as long as twenty men. And then I read the title.

It was an official file.

""Citizen: Sire Malleuch. Title: Cavalier of the Agemi Province. Capital of Tercus.""

I froze.

...Holy shit.

Am I reading the personal file of a *current* public figure? Isn't this wrong? What is this file doing so out in the open?

I tried to calm down. I couldn't.

I started reading.

The file began with his applications. Age? 19.

*Nineteen?* For one of the 13 Great Orders? Gods... he was just a *kid*.

And the list of failures was long.

Apparently, he didn't meet the requirements for the Order of Falcons (the feared snipers). Nor for the Dragons (the shock infantry). Nor for the Hippocamps (the sailors).

But... wait.

The *Lions* accepted him?

OH SHIT.

The Lions from *before* the 500-Year War! The ones who *were* the main infantry, not the damned police force they are now!

Fuck. *This* shit, I'm interested in.

I keep reading.

Okay, a 2-year training. The guy took the full program.

Apparently, he wasn't the most competent. There's a *meter* of scroll just for the demerit reports he received in training. (But, hey, in all fairness, the training from that era had a reputation for being brutal...)

His first deployment... where was it? Deployed to **Irksmur**?

Against the Great Hellus Republic? In the *middle* of the 500-Year War?

God damn it.

*That* was a battle. If I remember right, wasn't it 7,000 Hellus casualties to only 2,000 Imperials? A fucking massacre.

Oh, and now I remember! Irksmur was where Hellus started using laser weapons! It was because our plate armor resisted their firearms in the first two battles!

Fuck. This 21-year-old ""kid""... his *first* battle... was *that one*.

I keep scrolling down the parchment, mission after mission. Years of service...

...oh, shit.

At 39 years old? Rank: Captain.

Confirmed kills? *Two thousand*?

Two thousand! This bastard was a fucking beast!

And wait... the parchment dates it... this was **two years BEFORE** the Hellus even fielded the first power armor! (The famous ""answer from the metal dogs"" to the ""natural strength"" we Eternals have...)

I keep reading... HUH? The report says he survived *even after* power armor became standard on the field? And without serious injuries?

That's... weird.

Fuck, that's *very* weird.

(Scrolling...) At the end of the 500-Year War, he was promoted to Commander.

No. This guy wasn't a ""beast.""

This guy was absolutely and royally INSANE.

I keep reading. End of the war. Rank of Commander.

And the next year... ""DEMOTED""?

How the hell do you demote a beast with 5,000 kills!?

Ah... *AH*. The date.

Right when the fucking peace treaty with the Hellus Republic was signed.

God damn it. Of course. I remember that purge.

That's when they demoted the entire army under the rank of Royal Guard. Meaning, the **entire** fucking army... except for the 13 members of the Military Council, of course.

(Scanning the scroll...)

And there it is. ""Honorably discharged from the Order after 489 years, upon the signing of the treaty.""

Makes perfect sense.

They ""politically retired"" him. Swept him under the rug to sign the peace.

...Although, fuck, look at this. It wasn't just a kick in the ass. ""He was given all advantages by law: Lands, a full Imperial pension, and a noble title.""

A golden boot. A gilded cage so the ""last great lion"" could go home and shut the fuck up.

Okay... still reading.

The guy didn't stay quiet. Not for one damn minute.

Next entry in the file, the *same day* he was discharged: ""Registered with the Adventurers' Guild.""

Ah, look at that son of a bitch.

His ""first feat"" as an adventurer: ""Hired assassination of an entire bandit fortress.""

Fuck. You just can't take the war out of the man, huh?

(Skimming... more massacres, escort jobs, more bandits...) Yeah, okay, I get it, the bastard was a total beast.

Aha... and as I see here...

Wait.

WHAT?

""Confrontation with a Dragon Leviathan."" Those fucking sea serpents from *six hundred meters*?

It was destroying a dock and he... he... HE KILLED IT?!

(Reading again, this can't be...) How!?

...he took out its eyes.

The bastard blinded it. And then ""guided it"" so the beast impaled *itself* on a goddamn mountain.

...Gods.

No. ""Insane"" is too small a word.

This guy is a fucking monster.

I keep reading. Aha... he killed... armies of Tercus *undead*?

Wait one fucking minute.

He means *those* things? The ones that move on pure muscle memory and act like they did in life? Fuck, those things can literally be a well-organized army!

(Okay, ignoring that detail that's already blowing my mind...)

Oh, look at this cute little thing. The guy got himself an apprentice...

Frankly, I have to keep reading...

A leather-gloved hand landed on my shoulder.

""WHO THE FUCK DARES TOUCH M—?!"" I yelled, spinning in the seat, ready to hit.

And I froze.

She was there. Arms crossed. Staring at me with that cynical smirk I know all too well.

""...Ah. Hello, Princess.""

She tilted her head, her lynx-fur perfectly groomed.

""Uh... may I ask what the *fuck* you are doing reading in the **Restricted Archives**?""

I looked at the golden sign above the archway. I looked at the twenty-meter-long scroll.

""...Eh... Fuck.""

I swallowed.

""I knew it was too good to be true that this was in the normal section.""

She sighed, an exasperated sound I've heard a thousand times.

""You got lost, didn't you, you idiot?""

""...Yes.""

I hurried to say, feeling like a moron:

""...In my defense, it's my first time in the library! And I'm kinda scatterbrained! You know that!""

She let out a short, cynical laugh.

""Oh, I *know*, **Argerus**. You're the most disastrous student at the Arcane University I've ever met. And the competition is high.""

She paused, and her smile flickered, as if remembering something unpleasant.

""...Although, I retired early. Magic just isn't my thing.""

She shook her head, returning to her usual intel-chief tone.

""Gods. It's your first time in the Palace Library and you're already causing a state-level conflict by reading restricted files.""

She looked me up and down.

""Speaking of disasters, how's that research of yours? 'Pyromancy as a method to improve generator combustion efficiency'?""

She snorted.

""Frankly, idiotic research, if you ask me.""

I got offended.

""Hey,"" I retorted, a bit sharper than I intended. ""At least *I* can use magic. It's part of my Eternal biology. You, as a Linx, can't.""

The hit landed.

She snorted, looking at me like I was an insect.

""Oh, really? And you're rubbing it in my face, you **magic ape**? To me, a Linx?""

She crossed her arms.

""Well, whatever. Get out. Scram from my section.""

Then her eyes fixed on the scroll I was still holding.

""Ah, wait. Are you reading the dossier on Sire Malleuch?""

A strange smile, one that wasn't fake, played on her lips.

""That guy..."" she said, almost to herself. ""...is still a beast. Anyway, I shouldn't talk about that.""

She looked at me for a second, and her ""Intel Chief"" tone vanished. It softened.

""...How about we meet for coffee some other day?""

I was floored. I just managed to say, nervously:

""...Yeah. We should.""

I hurried to gather my things, avoiding her gaze.

""Well, I'm leaving. And seriously, you guys should put up clearer signs!""

(Did she just ask me on a date?) I thought, and then I left.

Before I was out of sight, she said:

""—By the way, you should stop by the Palace Gardens next time. They're also public. My father and I usually walk there. See if we can run into each other more often.""

Her voice was almost a... purr.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

The moment I picked up, I knew she probably had something upsetting to get off her chest. She just got promoted. You’d think that would be a happy thing, but her mom had just called and completely ruined her mood. First her mom praised her for the promotion, saying it was great that work was going well, and the next second she asked, “So what about your love life? You can’t just focus on your career forever, right?”

My friend let out this small laugh, the kind that’s all resignation. She said, “I didn’t even finish responding before my mom added that she’s short on money again, and asked if I could lend her some.”

She wasn’t angry at all, just tired. This isn’t the first time. Her family treats her like an on-call financial backup, yet they still feel entitled to pick apart her personal life, as if everything she’s achieved means nothing if she’s not dating someone.

When she finished talking, her voice was calm. And honestly, that calmness was what made me feel worse. She works so hard and stands so firmly on her own, but at home she can never escape those fixed roles: the daughter who makes money, the daughter who should be in a relationship, the daughter who can always be questioned.

I didn’t try to give advice. I just listened. It felt like she wasn’t asking to be comforted. She’s just been trying to play so many roles for so long, and none of them were ever really meant for her.",1,1763445607.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

My husband and I are big Dollhouse fans, and would yell out his name when it appeared in the opening credits, so it was fun to see him here, again, since he was also the brother of the kid who had the Kryptonite bomb in either season 2 or 3. But he's a terminator type character that Lex is developing, which is really all we know from the opening scene.

Lana is arranging flowers for some reason, and is using her hurt shoulder, back on the left side I think, as a way to keep Lex at a distance. A shifty senator shows up asking about Project Ares, Lana is eavesdropping and Lex is not cowed by the senator's threat.

Lionel is looking into the video from Noir when Clark shows up, demanding to know what he knows of Lana, and Lionel clocks him good, saying letting go was never one of his strong points. But Clark volleys back with Lionel telling the truth not being one of his strong points, which is also very true. Lionel denies any involvement but in a very careful way, and Clark isn't buying it. He tells Lionel if he finds out he had anything to do with Lana marrying Lex even though she wasn't happy, the gloves will come off. It's one of the few times that Clark gets that special kind of angry when it comes to Lana, most of the time he's a bit more subdued.

How is it that the second Lois is in a scene, I get this burst of serotonin? She just makes me so happy. She's getting coffee for Chloe, who is bummed about Jimmy being gone. Lois tries to be reassuring but in her own way which isn't really that reassuring lol. But this is one of those times where she says something that is supposed to be funny, but is actually really sad. Lois says that distance is good for a relationship, and she goes on to say, ""That is what all the guys who've moved away from me have said."" Idk but that always hits me, because it's like they are confirming her fears of not being enough and always being left behind. Chloe says thanks but no thanks to the advice, and then Clark is at the Talon to see her. Lois says hi, but then she speeds out of there. Now she's on the trail of the crooked senator, but could she also be avoiding Clark? Hard to tell. He almost smiles when she calls him Smallville, but not quite, and she says some farm lingo before leaving. So of course now that Lois is gone, my happiness is gone, and dour Clark is here to bring me down with all his Lana talk.

Lois is already gathering sources like infinity rings lol, she thanks the guy for the tip and boldly goes to confront the senator. This whole scene proves that the Inquisitor won't be enough for her soon, and her skills are only improving. It doesn't look good for our intrepid reporter, but then something is taking the henchmen and the senator out. It's the guy from Lex's project, sent to tie up loose ends, and Lois is caught in the crossfire, only this time, she knows him.

Clark can tell something is going on, and Chloe tells him about the senator's death and how everyone thinks it was a mob hit, but Lois was there when it happened. This scene bugs me because I just know if the restrictions weren't there, Clark would have knelt down near Lois, maybe even hugging her, but there would be more than what we got. Although maybe he sensed that Lois was close to her breaking point and he didn't want to tip the scale. But when he sees her, he says her name so softly, and looks concerned, scanning her body for any injury after seeing the blood on her jacket. She tells them she knows who killed the senator, a guy named Wes Keenan. They were army brats together as kids, and when Clark thinks he works for the mob, Lois defends him. She says Wes is career military, a highly decorated officer, and someone even the general loves. This bit of information, and the scene with her and Wes later makes me think that there is a third love in Lois' life. We know she loved Oliver, and of course Clark is the love of her life, but I think Wes was her first puppy love, someone she admired and cared about. Perhaps him being career military is why they aren't together, because at this point, Lois doesn't think she can handle that kind of life. But the fact that her dad liked Wes and she still liked him as well is a testament to how much she cared about him. Younger Lois loved nothing more than to shock her father with the guys she spent time with and brought home. Chloe comes back with the news that Wes is dead according to the government but Lois is adamant about seeing him, citing a scar above his right eye. They can't find any more information at this time, his military record has been classified.

Oh Lex with his underground labs. I want to hope that if he found out the complication was Lois Lane, Lex might have hesitated ordering her to be eliminated, but he's never really liked her and he's in his villain era right now, so maybe not?

Lois at the Kent farm always feels right to me. They're in the barn talking, which means in between this scene and the scene at the Daily Planet, Clark convinced Lois to stay with him at the farm, which is kind of adorable, despite the dire circumstances. Clark tells her to not be stubborn, she's going to stay there until they get it cleared up, which also means she's probably been trying to convince him otherwise for a while, which is also adorable. Martha is there as well, and she agrees with Clark, though Lois says she can take care of herself. Martha doesn't doubt that but thinks she'd be safer at the farm. Clark even calls back to when she was living with them in season 4, but Lois teases him with saying he's just hoping to catch her in the shower again, which is a callback to season 5. If Martha wasn't there I could see it getting a bit more flirty with Clark's reply, but Martha *is* there and Clark looks embarrassed lol and he clearly never told his mother about that little detail. Lois looks a little embarrassed herself and she thanks them. Martha calls her practically family, which is so true, she was a Kent the day she showed up. Lois asks for a favor and I absolutely love that Clark assumes she's asking him. He kind of puffs up his chest when he says, ""What do you need?"" Lois bursts his hero bubble by saying she needs his mother's political influence to look into Wes' file, and Clark visibly deflates. Lois goes onto say she tried her father but he wants her to drop it, and Clark agrees. Three men have already died, he doesn't want Lois to be next. Martha says she'll help. Lois thanks Mrs. K, and then gets that stubborn look on her face, a face Clark recognizes. She tells him it's not just a story for her, this is personal. There's a noise, Clark tells Lois to stay there while he goes to investigate, which of course she doesn't listen and follows him instead. Then Wes appears and yeets Clark, no easy feat. He's about to kill Lois, but she says his name and he hesitates, grabbing her and making her invisible and escaping before Clark can stop him.

I like all the little callbacks, from Alicia to Graham Garrett to Titan, and it's clear that Wes is a formidable opponent. Clark and Chloe are very worried about Lois, and Chloe finds a connection to Lex through Jodi Keenan from Nemesis. Another shout out to Oliver. Clark is willing to do anything to save Lois, even talk to Lex, though Chloe dissuades him because she knows Lex won't tell Clark anything. But Clark isn't giving up, he's going to find a way to get Lois back.

I'm genuinely curious how long Lana thought she could keep up the ruse. She turns her cheek every time Lex tries to kiss her, basically visibly recoils any time he touches her, and while I understand where she's coming from, it's not a sustainable plan. Like, what was she gonna say before they were interrupted? Lana overhears something about an asset not returning, but then Clark shows up. And I like that at least at first, he's not there for them, he's there for Lois. I think it's hilarious that Lana says Ares, and Clark explains that's the god of war. Guess all that time hanging out with Lex etched some things into his brain. Lana says the senator is involved and to talk to him, but Clark reveals that he's dead. Clark needs more information and Lana relays the thing about the asset. Clark explains that's what the military calls its soldiers, and he looks pretty angry about that, but then Clark veers away from being a great and selfless friend, and warns Lana about not knowing what Lex is capable of, thinking she has no idea. Oh Clark, you sweet summer child. Then these idiots are about to kiss, with Lex right down the hall and Lois in danger, and I kind of hate them both here. Thank goodness they get interrupted by Lex though, who has to leave to deal with the Wes situation.

Lois wakes up, and tries to bring Wes back to himself, telling how she met him at one of the army bases her father dragged her to when she was a kid, and how he got that scar. I wish we could have seen kid Lois, she sounds like a little hellion in the best way. But they got into the general's whiskey, broke into a storage warehouse, goofed around, and Lois being the proactive woman she is even at a younger age, kissed Wes(also leads into my theory that this was her first puppy love). It was the first time she ever kissed anybody, and Wes smiled but then got sick and passed out from the whiskey, cracking his head open on the floor. She reveals they're at the place where the kiss happened, and that's what gets through to Wes.

Lex's scientists can't find Wes, and Lex is very comic booky here with his impassioned speech about protecting the planet, and they figure out a way to try to reset Wes to his original directive.

Back with Lois, she's been filling Wes in about what's been going on, and she finds out Lex is behind it, and there's something about these 2 characters where I wouldn't mind seeing them in more scenes. Their history is believable and they bounce off each other well. Wes is understandably upset at how he's been tricked, and Lois is put on her path that leads her to the Daily Planet even more, saying Lex won't get away with this and they'll expose the project, but it's too late. Wes tells Lois to run, but there's nowhere for her to go. 

Chloe and Clark are back at the farm after she contacted Oliver and he went to see Lana, and Wes isn't the first person this has happened to. She tells him it took a mini-nuke to take an earlier version down. Martha, the badass she is, got Wes' military jacket and Clark says Lois was right(something he'll probably have to get used to saying lol), Wes was a hero. Lois definitely has a type, but I never saw that as a bad thing. They figure out what base Wes took Lois, and Clark zooms away. We find out that Lois was there in junior high, which means she didn't get her first kiss until she was 12-14, which makes sense with her father and her childhood of never staying in one place long. It makes her finding a home in Smallville (both the place and the person), that much more special. After Clark leaves, Chloe and Martha share a moment about dealing with Clark just whooshing away mid conversation lol. I love that the second Clark has something to go on, he springs into action to save Lois.

Lois is running away, climbing over a fence, but Wes has gone invisible and he closes the door in front of her. She tries to talk to him, tries to bring him back to himself again, but this time it's not working, and he's choking her. He drops her, and Clark is there to catch her. He lifts her up bridal style and is looking around for Wes as he walks with Lois, needing to keep her safe. He sets her down gently on a pile of something, I can't really tell what it is. Wes is watching them and Clark can't waste any time, though he does touch her shoulder before leaving her there. Then we get what I think is a pretty good scene with Clark's heat vision going nuclear to get through Wes' forcefield. Lois wakes up, Wes is dying, and Clark is left watching her heart break in the shadows. She begs Wes not to leave her, and this is probably the most vulnerable Clark has ever seen Lois, and he can't do anything about it. He can't comfort her, he can't reveal that he saved her in the first place, he just stands there and watches her cry. It's not technically important, but it's poignant, and it just reenforces Clark's feelings of only bringing pain to the people he cares about. I kind of feel like he stayed as long as he did as a sort of penance. He didn't want to kill Wes, and his actions hurt Lois so he witnessed her pain as a consequence of his actions, but maybe also out of respect for Lois? Idk, I just really like that scene.

Clark is looking at Wes' military jacket, sad at how things turned out for the man who only wanted to serve his country. Martha talks about the corruption of the government (who knew that would continue to be as relevant now as it was then.) Lionel shows up and Martha is going to be a U.S. senator now, not just a state senator. Clark encourages her to go, to be able to make a difference for people like Wes. I know Clark feels deeply about everyone, but I can't help but feel like seeing Lois in pain adds something a bit sharper to his feelings. Like if this was a stranger to her, it wouldn't have affected him this much.

Lana isn't as sneaky as she thinks she is, Lex knew about her eavesdropping. She tries to play it off but seeing as Lex is at the end of his patience with her, it doesn't really work. He basically tells her he'd lose it if she betrayed him, and Lana is very Luthor-like in her response, saying ""I'd never hurt the man I love."" We all know who she means, and honestly, it feels like Lex does as well.

Clark is back at the Daily Planet, and he and Chloe are talking about Martha going to Washington. Neither of them trust Lionel but Lex is the bigger problem. Clark brings up Lana and how he doesn't want her near Lex when he goes full dark. Chloe says he should be in bars before that, with Lois bringing the feds to the morgue to see Wes's body, and once he is connected to Lex, that's the end for him. Lois shows up, saying Wes' body wasn't there and they wouldn't believe her because of her working at the Inquisitor, and that as far as the government is concerned, Wes died in combat four months prior. Clark tells Lois he's sorry, and it's a genuine sorrow, but Lois doesn't want him to be sorry for her. She tells him to be sorry for Lex, and that he's going to pay for what he did and she's going to ""make damn sure that he doesn't do this to anyone else."" And Lois, being that woman of action she usually is, leaves to go do just that.

Of course Lex is the one who got Wes' body, but they need more alien DNA to make another soldier viable. We then see that Project Ares has soo many clones, like a ridiculous amount really, and he's not stopping his experiments.

Phantom starts with a very scared woman, and Martian Manhunter coming to try to help, but he's no match for the Phantom. Lex's men show up to take it into custody, but it escapes.

Lex and Lionel have some tense words, and Lionel reveals that he made Lana marry Lex, and John Glover is chewing the scenery here, he's just so good!

Clark and Martha say their goodbyes, and Martha gently suggests that Clark should leave the farm as well, but with his mom in Washington, and his father gone, Clark is going to cling to the farm as a sort of security blanket, for at least another year.

Lois is trying to figure out what some numbers that Wes kept repeating mean, and her table looks like a deconstructed murder board lol. Chloe tells her to let it go,.and she mentions what Lex did to her mother, which means that at some point, Chloe told Lois about what happened in Progeny. Lois agrees to let it go, and she rips up the number, but that's just the clue she needed. They're longitude and latitude coordinates, and Lois is back on the trail.

Lex is following the trail of bodies to find the phantom to make his clone army viable, and we see a clone with some long hair, and I wonder who in the world that could be for.

Oh look, Lana is in Clark's barn, looking teary-eyed, better gear up for a very angsty scene. She tells Clark she's leaving Lex, and he's so happy, but she's not staying, saying Lex will be angry and it won't be safe for her. Clark assures her she doesn't have to worry about Lex and that he can protect her from anything. Lana declares she will always love Clark, and leaves but Clark can't let her go, and he superspeeds in front of her, and he wants to tell her about him. She says she already knows about his powers, but he reveals that he's an alien. She doesn't say anything which makes Clark worry, but then she kisses him and it is a diabolical shot with her wedding ring shining brightly. And again, it's not their best kiss, but it's fine. Lana says he's still the same Clark Kent to her, and I kind of want to call bullshit, because she doesn't really treat him the same way in season 7, but for now, sure Jan. But then Clark says there's no reason for her to go now and it is very clear that if she wasn't leaving, Clark wouldn't have told her the truth, but just like in Reckoning, he was afraid of losing her. Lana then tells Clark that Lionel forced her to marry Lex, and she had to know what Clark would do. There was a look as she turned away from Clark, like a deep breath and a steadying of nerves and a hardening, before she turned back around all sad eyes again. Lana wanted Lionel to suffer, and she used Clark to get it, all the while knowing she was going to fake her death and put Clark through all of that.

Clark wastes no time in going after Lionel and if Martian Manhunter hadn't stopped him, Clark would have absolutely killed Lionel, and I think that would have broken him a little. Yes Lionel did some bad things and he brought both Clark and Lana pain, but to actually kill a human in cold blood? I'm not sure Clark would survive something like that intact. And it's interesting that he's always been afraid of his Kryptonian side being the dangerous side, but this was all his human side. 

Lex is on his way to apprehending the phantom, but Lana chooses that moment to tell him she's leaving him. It's a tense scene and they both do a good job, especially with Lex's inability to own up to his mistakes. Lana reveals she knows the pregnancy was fake and calls Lex a monster for deceiving her in that way. Lex says despite everything he's done, there is something still between them, but Lana thinks all there is is lies, and Idk, I stand by the point that if Lex had just been honest with her, and not faked her pregnancy, Lana could have been his dark queen ala Kingpin and Vanessa from Daredevil, but then she twists the knife and says Lex isn't capable of love and that he never was. And again, I don't know if that's wholly true. By this point, with everything he's done, sure, but I think in the beginning he could have been capable of it. Lexmas proved that, but he wasn't willing to risk it and craved control and power above all, a true Luthor. Lex closes the doors in an ominous way, and then brings up Clark, which makes Lana roll her eyes and I kind of feel her on that. Because while Lana still had conflicting feelings for Clark, their problem was Lex's deception, and he's still deflecting even now. But Lana twists the knife, telling Lex ""Clark means more to me than you ever will."" That is like Lex's Achilles heel, and he does not take it well, back handing Lana. Lana tells Lex that's the last time he'll ever touch her, but he still tries to stop her. She basically says he'd have to kill her to keep her there, so he lets her go.

Clark is confused, but he's listening to Lionel explain himself and it sure seems like he got over his anger pretty quickly. Martian Manhunter and Lionel tell Clark about the final phantom and how it's a Kryptonian lab experiment who is killing people as it's seeking the perfect host, a Kryptonian. We also get an explanation of why the Martian Manhunter has appeared just now, and why Lionel knows the things he knows. 

Quick scene of Lois following the coordinates to Reeve's Dam, and seeing a way in, but then we're back at the Daily Planet, and Clark and Chloe are trying to find the phantom. I think it's kind of hilarious that Clark, who doesn't work at the Daily Planet at all, can just set up shop on Chloe's desk and use a computer to do research. But they figure out the phantom is now in a little boy who Lex took, and Clark tells Chloe that not only is Lana leaving Lex, but that she knows the truth about him being an alien. I don't think this is played as Chloe being slightly jealous in a romantic way, but more that she enjoyed being the one to know his secret. Clark says he'll be happy about Lana's acceptance once he stops the phantom, but I seem to recall him being happy about a certain intrepid reporter in the middle of all sorts of problems, and he didn't need an issue to be resolved before he could be happy about her acceptance....but that's just me.

I love Lois and I know she's usually really good at getting herself out of sticky situations, but this definitely isn't one of her best plans. She's sneaking around the dam, but gets caught by a guard. She's able to defend herself pretty well, but not good enough, and he stabs her with a knife that might as well be a sword. I do love her headbutting him right after, but Lois would be smart enough to not take the knife out, she'd know that the quickest way to bleed out, but I guess they needed her dead to show Chloe's ability. Lois tries walking away, and she tries to call Chloe, but she passes out from the blood loss.

Lana has set her plan in motion, calling Lionel and telling him she's done with the Luthors and she's leaving Smallville. Good riddance I say. But Lionel wants to talk to Lana and he arrives just in time to see her seemingly get blown up. I honestly wouldn't have minded if this is how her character went out.

Clark busting into the Luthor mansion always makes me chuckle. He tells Lionel that Lex has the phantom, but Lionel tells Clark that Lana is dead, and Clark is devastated. Not as devastated as when Alicia died or the first time Lana died, or when his father died, but he is distraught. Lionel says he's sorry multiple times, but Clark immediately jumps from sadness to anger, blaming Lex, and who knows, maybe Lana anticipated that as well and wanted Clark to kill Lex. He wants Lionel to tell him where Lex is, but Lionel refuses, because it seems he knows Clark better than Lana. He won't let Clark do something he'll regret for the rest of his life. As an answer to that, Clark disappears.

Chloe finds Lois, but she's dead, and Chloe is now the devastated one, and I gotta say I feel more in this scene than Clark's scene. One of Chloe's tears falls on Lois, and it's all glowy, and Lois wakes up with her wound healed, and Chloe now being the one who is dead.

Kidnapping a child possessed by a phantom is pretty high on the list of Lex's atrocities, but he gets what he wants in the kid's blood. But the phantom wakes up and kills a couple of his men. Lex runs away like the coward he is, and Clark is actually clever in following Lionel, who has green kryptonite with him. Clark confronts Lex and he is seething with rage and disgust. I think it's not just Lana who brings out the worst in Clark, it's Lex too. Here, he's petty and cruel and there is just a touch of Clark Luthor in his demeanor. And I'm not saying Lex deserves any respect or decency, but Clark wouldn't normally be that vindictive in his language. But Lex is truly in the dark, he has no idea what Clark is talking about. The phantom shows up, and Clark, as angry as he is, is still Clark, so he shoves Lex away and faces the phantom, who is getting exactly what he wants with Clark being there. Lex is getting the hell out of dodge, but he gets stopped by the police, and is arrested for Lana's murder. It's always nice when Clark can go all out, but the dam is collapsing with these two Kryptonian beings fighting. Lionel tries to take out the phantom with the green kryptonite, but all it does is make him stronger. Clark wants to know what the hell the phantom is, and he says one of those lines you either love or hate. Personally, I love those lol. ""I'm you, only a little more bizarre."" And we've got Bizarro now, who launches Clark out of the dam, and who can fly, with a distorted face as the final shot. 

Whew! Season 6 is done! I probably should have split these into two weeks but I thought they would be quicker episodes. I was wrong lol. But it's done now, and bring on season 7! Thank you guys for taking this journey with me!

1p0455c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsefulThingsOnly/comments/1p0455c/couples_travel_advice_that_actually_works/,Couples Travel Advice That Actually Works,"Traveling as a couple is basically the Olympics of relationships. It can be the most fun you ever have together or the fastest route to silent-treatment speedruns. After years of hearing travel horror stories, success stories, and Reddit wisdom, here’s the guide most couples *wish* they read before their first big trip.

# 1. Before You Book Anything

Most travel fights start because two people assumed the other person wanted the same thing. They did not.

# Figure Out Your Travel Styles

Sit down and ask the real questions:

* Are you a beach potato or a ""hike a mountain at 5 a.m."" person?
* Do you want every hour planned or to wake up and vibe?
* Cities or nature?
* Luxury hotel or “this Airbnb has character” (aka no AC)?
* Michelin-star meal or street food stall with plastic stools?

If you are opposites, choose places with variety: Bali, Thailand, Costa Rica, Cape Town, etc.

**Compromise does not mean one person is miserable. It means both people get something they enjoy.**

# Talk Money Before You Spend Money

Yes, it is awkward. Yes, it is necessary. Money fights blow up vacations faster than anything.

Figure out:

|Money Topic|What You Need to Decide|
|:-|:-|
|Total budget|How much the entire trip should cost|
|Daily spend|What is reasonable per day|
|Payments|Split 50/50, shared travel fund, alternate categories|
|Priorities|Hotel comfort, food, tours, experiences, shopping|
|Splurges|One big treat you will save for|

Also, please do not travel if it pushes you into debt. That is not romantic.

# Be Clear About the Purpose of the Trip

Is this a relax-and-eat trip? An adventure? A “test run before moving in together”? Are people expecting a proposal?

Just say the thing. Unspoken expectations create drama.

# 2. The Do’s: What Actually Works

# Do: Spend Time Apart

Couples who spend every second together burn out fast.

Easy ways to take space:

* One sleeps in, the other gets coffee and explores.
* One hits the museum, the other goes shopping or surfing.
* On long trips, take a half or full solo day.

You will come back happier and less likely to fight over tiny nonsense.

# Do: Share the Travel Workload

Travel is real work. Split it up based on strengths.

|Task|Who Does It|
|:-|:-|
|Planning|The spreadsheet lover|
|Transport|The person who handles logistics without crying|
|Hotels|Alternate or split|
|Budget|Pick one person or do it together|

A balanced team is a happy team.

# Do: Communicate Like Grown Adults

Travel makes people emotional. Hungry, tired, stressed, overstimulated. Talk gently.

Say:  
""I am overwhelmed. Can we slow down tomorrow?""  
Not:  
""You always drag me around.""

Also: daily vibe check-ins are wildly underrated.

# Do: Eat Before You Get Hangry

This solves at least 30 percent of travel arguments.

Carry snacks. Eat regularly. Prioritize food before feelings.

# Do: Laugh at the Chaos

Every great travel story starts with something going wrong.

Flight delay? Soaked by rain? Wrong train? Laugh. These become your favorite memories.

# Do: Splurge on Something Cool

Budget travel is awesome, but one special experience can make the whole trip unforgettable.

# Do: Take Photos of Each Other

Not just selfies. Actual photos. Candid moments. Sunlight moments. “I like how you look right now” moments.

Trust me: it matters.

# 3. The Don’ts: Learn From Other People’s Mistakes

|Don’t|Why|
|:-|:-|
|Travel to fix relationship issues|You will just fight in prettier places|
|Expect surprises without talking|Especially proposals|
|Add friends or family without asking|Hard no|
|Let one person do all planning|Leads straight to resentment|
|Split up in sketchy areas|Safety over independence|
|Blame your partner for things no one controls|Delays and weather are not personal attacks|
|Try to recreate Instagram|Have your own experience|

# 4. How to Make It Romantic Without Trying Too Hard

Reddit-tested tips:

* Limit scheduled activities to one or two a day. Leave room to wander.
* Walk everywhere. Hold hands. Explore without a plan.
* Make a loose “menu” of options instead of a strict itinerary.
* Take flattering candid photos of your partner and show them immediately.
* Plan one small surprise: sunset picnic, rooftop drink, couples massage.
* Put your phones away for actual chunks of time.

# 5. Long-Term Travel Tips (6 Months to Infinity)

Living out of backpacks together is a special kind of relationship test.

* Check in every few months: ""Do we still like this lifestyle?""
* Stay longer in one place sometimes so you can rest.
* If one person feels unsafe, you both leave.
* Accept quirks you never noticed before.
* Expect arguments. What matters is how quickly you bounce back.

Couples who survive long-term travel together can usually survive anything.

# 6. Couples Travel Bucket List

Destinations that rarely disappoint:

|Place|Why Couples Love It|
|:-|:-|
|Maldives|Idyllic villas and romance|
|Bora Bora|Overwater fantasy|
|Santorini|Unreal views|
|Cappadocia|Sunrise balloons|
|Seychelles or Cook Islands|Quiet paradise|
|Paris|It is Paris|
|Kyoto|Magical in spring|
|African safari|Bucket list wildlife|
|Amalfi Coast or Cape Peninsula|Insane road trip views|
|Petra|Sunrise magic|
|Machu Picchu|Epic and meaningful|
|St Lucia|Jungle and beaches|
|Tuscany or Napa|Chill wine days|
|Sahara or Costa Rica glamping|Adventure with comfort|
|Palawan or Phi Phi|Stunning and affordable|",1,1763445212.0,UsefulThingsOnly,0,1.0,False
1p04554,https://www.reddit.com/r/AudioProgramming/comments/1p04554/seeking_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,seeking ultimate perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p04514,https://i.redd.it/wguf1qlyfy1g1.jpeg,I’m an urban explorer for the US government (Part 2),"
It was a long time before I finally fell asleep that night. The lights of passing cars painted lines across the ceiling through the shoddy curtains. Somewhere in the distance, a freight train called out. After about the eight-billionth time rolling over in a vain attempt to find a comfortable position, the HVAC unit rattled and kicked on.

I’d keyed Marcus’s number and hit dial before I was awake enough to think about what I would even say. It didn’t ring more than twice before the line crackled.

“J-man! Kinda late for a booty call, dude. What’s up?”

“No sleep for me tonight,” I muttered. “Anyway, you told me to call, remember?”

“Sure I did. Just thought you’d do it yesterday. Listen—I’m a bit tied up at the moment. If you want to talk, come to the address I’m sending you. And bring coffee while you’re at it.”

“Yeah, yeah. Alright.”

My phone said he was only fifteen minutes away at some transmission shop or something.

“See you in a bit.”

I glanced around the stuffy motel room to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything. I didn’t bring much in—just didn’t have it in me to unpack. I scooped up my keys, threw on my jacket, and stepped into the cold.

It took a full five minutes for my car to warm up. I stuffed my hands in my pockets and drummed my feet to fight the early morning chill seeping through everything. One gas station run and a white Monster later, I was beginning to feel human again. I shoved a honey bun into my glovebox behind the air filter and cranked the heat to toast it.

I pulled into the mechanics shop around 3AM. Aside from the graveyard of parts cars scattered around the lot, I recognized Marcus’s Tacoma and a Prius with out-of-state plates. The sign in the window was off. So were the lights. But behind the roll-up garage doors, something faint crackled.

I tried the side door and knocked.

There was a pause—the sound of a chair moving, then several clicks—before the door swung open. Judy stood framed in the doorway, sporting elbow-length green gloves over the same suit she’d worn the previous morning. Her air of professionalism was no less precise, despite the setting.

“Are we delivering a calf or something?” I blurted.

Shockingly, she chortled at that. She recovered quickly and waved me inside.

“Hurry up. I don’t own this place.”

“Sorry—Marcus didn’t mention you’d be here, or I would’ve brought more coffee.”

She relocked the door and propped a metal chair under the handle.

“No worries. I brought my own. Mark’s over in the pit. Go grab a seat, sounded like you had a busy first day’l

Ignoring the irony behind that last comment for the time being, I rolled a stool over to the edge of the lift pit, where Marcus was hauling thick-gauge extension cables. He glanced up, grinned when he saw the tall Styrofoam cup, and took it with both hands.

“Aaah, you’re a lifesaver. We’re on a bit of a tight schedule tonight, so you’ll have to bear with us working while we talk.”

The cords ran across the floor toward a microwave lying on its back and some instruments I didn’t recognize. With more questions than sleep in me, I decided to stick with what I could handle.

“What’s the microwave for?” I asked.

“The sample we took earlier isn’t stable,” he said. “It starts degrading within hours of being separated from the colony. We’re too far from any of our permanent labs, so in certain cases…” He gestured at the spaghetti mess. “…we improvise.”

Judy approached, apparently having predicted my next question.

“Nyctophyllosis,” she said. “A metastable crystalline silicon—”

She held the ceramic vessel from earlier in her gloved hands, stepping carefully toward the pit.

“Think of it like a fluid made of microscopic solar panels. Except we don’t know what it’s made of or how it works. The closest we’ve gotten is mass spectrometry, but that destroys the sample almost instantly. What we can infer is that it feeds on most forms of electromagnetic radiation, and it’s sensitive to high-energy wavelengths like ionizing radiation and UV.”

I let her talk. I wasn’t awake enough in high school science to have ever understood this stuff, and she didn’t seem bothered by that. If anything, the lecture felt like a side effect of her nerves.

“We can contain a sample with most of its mass intact by encasing it inside a glass sphere using a short, yet powerful burst of microwave radiation. Hence the… McGyver setup.”

They secured the container inside the microwave. Marcus set the timer, then started messing with the exposed side panel.

“We’re gonna burn this thing out,” he said, “but it’ll do the job. Just don’t look through the screen—this creates a fair bit of plasma.”

Judy grabbed a welder’s mask and leaned over the microwave as it whirred to life. Marcus ducked down and pulled safety glasses from his hair.

The sound of the microwave was quickly drowned out by crackling and a high-voltage buzz. Arcs of light illuminated our dim surroundings, and in a flash the machine was dead. Judy wasted no time exhuming the canister. A torrent of smoke billowed from within, bringing the smells of carbon and fresh ozone. She carefully unlidded the container and poured its contents into a Home Depot bucket full of what I assumed was water. It hissed, and I heard a small clunk as the drop of molten liquid hit the bottom. How anything living or otherwise could survive that was beyond me.

While we waited for it to cool, Judy and Marcus tried their best to answer my questions as they sanitized the scene. Marcus had worked for the company for years—something he’d been brought into at college overseas. He promised he hadn’t been hanging out with me with the sole purpose of recruiting me, something I hadn’t even considered yet.

Judy was much less enthusiastic about conversation after the whole process. She had to be exhausted at that point. She admitted to bugging me with the listening device earlier to gauge how I reacted to the Nycto and to get a recording of the encounter, since the stuff apparently blocked most forms of radio communication.

It was almost five by the time we wrapped up, and with daylight and the threat of the shop’s actual inhabitants returning, we all agreed to head to a nearby diner. Judy pulled what she called a “Prince Rupert’s drop” from the bucket where it had been cooling. It was about the size of a mandarin orange—a clear bubble filled with a jet-black haze.

Once I’d sliced into my pancakes, I began to contemplate the undeniable fact that an entire secret government organization could not exist solely to mess with these glass blobs. I wondered then what else there was out there in the dark that I didn’t know about. For better or worse. I wouldn’t have to wait all that long. On the bright side, for the first time in my life I could leave a decent tip without even a second thought. ",1,1763445200.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I don’t think I understand what casual dating is lol. I meet him and we go to chikfila and buys me food with him and he seems like he comfortable with me talking to me about his school and giving me his phone to look at this email he was sending to his new tutor. I was done up with my nails and my hair and nice outfit and he says I’m suprised you didn’t wear your red hoodie cuz my Snapchat girl wears one and I have one in rl. I didn’t really say anything I think I said I like to look nice I don’t remember. And then after walking around at the mall he said your taller than I thought and I’m like erm and he says he likes it. And so fast forward I’m waiting for my ride and he asks if I need a ride and I say no because I don’t know him lol. Before he leaves he’s like do you want to hang out again as friends? And I’m like okay so the next time we see each other, he asked if he could meet my mom and pick me up so I was okay (I don’t drive currently and I’m staying at my moms for the holidays) like 5 mins when I was in the car with him he said he felt guilty if not being honest with me about being on methadone so I just wanted to be caring and I said thank you for being honest.  we go to a coffee shop and we’re sitting outside and he said he wants to take a drink of the coffee that I got and I said no cuz I have a breakout currently. And he tried to downplay it saying his mom gets the same and then hes like so I can’t kiss you or hold your hands? And I was just like take back tbh. He has been heavily using the word friends. So I didn’t want to come across as being lusty so I was like I don’t know what to say. So I asked him what he was looking for so he said he was going with the flow, seeing where things go and immediately that pops up as a red flag in my mind and I sat there and I didn’t say anything so he said or we can be friends. I’m friends with a girl that recently got married and I’m at that point I was like erm ok. He drops me off and then the next time he asks me if I want to go workout with him and I said sure and then asks me if I would like to come over and have dinner with him and I said sure. He picks me up and drives me to his house and 5 seconds before we go in he shares me what his parents names are and it took me to realize that coming in the front door that he lives with his parents 😫 (I’m 32 and he’s 40) I’m so nervous at his point I’m trying to act cool. His parents didn’t really ask me any such questions just kept it cool I think they realized I was nervous and told me this is just casual. (Because to me meeting parents is a serious sign) so I sat down with them and ate dinner and he showed me his drum set and his dog. I just feel confused at this point tbh. Then after we went to go take his dog for a walk and he gives me a flower. Which was cute. And the we left to go to the gym and mind you I’m not overly fit but I’m not obese either. He asked the trainer to give me some of his sessions to me to show me how to do weight and the forms. And iddddk I’ve always struggled with my weight so that made me feel so insecure.

With Christmas creeping up on us (I swear this year flew by), a lot of us are already stressing about what to gift our family, friends, or coworkers. And honestly, this time around, I’ve noticed more people asking for ideas that are *meaningful* but also *eco-friendly*. So I thought—why not share a roundup of some of the **best sustainable gifts for Christmas** that don’t feel preachy or boring?

Here are some genuinely cool, practical, and planet-friendly picks that people will *actually* want to use 👇

🌱 1. Reusable Coffee Cups

A good-quality insulated coffee cup makes a huge difference—less waste, keeps drinks warm longer, and is perfect for coffee lovers who are always on the go.

♻️ 2. Upcycled Accessories

Brands are making bags, wallets, and even laptop sleeves out of recycled materials. They look stylish and carry a great story behind them.

🌿 3. Zero-Waste Starter Kits

These are one of my favorite **gifts for Christmas** because they’re useful and surprisingly fun. Usually they include reusable straws, bamboo toothbrushes, beeswax wraps, and more.

🕯️ 4. Natural Soy or Coconut Candles

They burn cleaner, smell amazing, and don’t release toxins. Great gift for anyone who loves cozy vibes.

🎍 5. Plant Gifts

Indoor plants boost mood, purify the air, and make any space look better. You can even choose low-maintenance ones for friends who *might* forget to water them (we all know at least one person).

🧴 6. Refillable Skincare Products

A lot of skincare brands now offer refillable packaging. It reduces plastic waste and still feels luxe as a gift.

# 💬 Why Sustainable Gifting Matters

Choosing sustainable options isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress. Even one eco-friendly purchase can reduce waste, support ethical brands, and inspire others to do the same. If everyone swapped even one traditional item for a greener one, it would make a huge impact over time.

# 🎄 Final Thoughts

If you’re stuck on what to choose, just think about what fits the person’s daily life. The best **gifts for Christmas** are thoughtful, practical, and long-lasting—and going sustainable just makes it even better.",1,1763444833.0,TheBusinessEdge,0,1.0,False

For this batch no nitrates used however I have started using them for my more recent batches. 

Should be approx 1 months left in the chamber. Should I leave it? Should I give it a good wiping down with white vinegar?

tight. walls morphing around me  
""*I can't breathe*""  
suddenly a  yellow phone appears in my hand  
heavy.  
*no response.*

""*I can't do this anymore.*""

grabbing my razor blade  
I don't have the courage to say  
as a vein is cut in twain  
as my body starts to sway.

with all the courage I have left.  
I write a note to the one who(s) left.  
""*I forgive you*"" I always will  
""*chase your dreams*"" as I swallow a pill

church bells echo throughout my head  
everything I had ever said  
I'm sorry *yellow* for what I've done  
I'll try to find you in the next one.

as death grows ever near  
the reaper sits in his boat  
the taste of metal (flesh)

your life I'll mend

I was weak and you were strong

i transfer my attention to that as I grab a cup of coffee  
""*notable features include painted nails, blonde hair.*.""  
the scalding feeling of hot coffee can't compare to the ache in my heart.

my lightweight blue phone suddenly rings.

""*i made mine.*""  
""*I'm giving up.*""  
""*I hate you. and I love you.*""  
I love you too..

your house had yellow police tape surrounding it  
that didn't stop me.  
heading inside I see your blue room mostly empty.

I see you inside.  
your eyes white.  
phone in your hand.  
the last thing you see being our  
chats.

The blood is still on the floor.  
the blade still held by the tips of your pale white fingers.  
I don't want your death to be in vain.  
i.. wanna feel your *pain*.

The rush of adrenaline through my veins  
the feeling of the cold dull blade digging through my wrists.  
the white-hot pain spreading all throughout.  
the smell of hope from your cold blue body.

""*you wanted me to live didn't you?*""

cold white porcelain floors are all I feel.  
I can't obey your dying wish  
I know it's selfish,  
I know it ain't true.  
I'm coming ***blue***  
I'll see you soon.

1p03yqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Representative-Pin89/comments/1p03yqd/twentyfour_years_later_still_trying_to_make_sense/,Twenty-Four Years Later: Still Trying to Make Sense of 9/11,"October 16th, 2025



I was lying in bed last night thinking about 9/11—again. It’s often the case. The events of that day have lived in the background of my mind since they happened, but as I’ve grown older—especially in the past few years—they seem to haunt me more deeply.

In recent years, I’ve made it a quiet ritual to watch the annual memorial service: the solemn reading of every victim’s name, the bells tolling at each significant timestamp from that morning. It’s the closest I can come to bearing witness in real time.

I was 11 years old when it happened. I was in South Africa, home alone with my older sister after school. We were lying on our mother’s bed, flipping through channels—me wanting to watch PB&J Otter, her insisting on something else. She landed on CNN just as the first tower burned. We froze. Minutes later, we watched the second plane strike. Then the towers fell. Then came news of the Pentagon, the field in Pennsylvania. We sat there, two children, absorbing a horror we couldn’t possibly understand.

The next day, everything changed. At school, I was suddenly “Osama bin Laden.” Kids told me to “go back to my country.” I was just a mixed-race kid who happened to be Muslim—and overnight, that made me the enemy. My religion, my identity, was branded as dangerous. I was 11, and I internalized the message clearly: I was bad.

By the time I was in my late teens I had turned away from Islam completely. I never looked back. It wasn’t until my late twenties—and now, in my mid-thirties—that I’ve truly begun to grasp the full weight of what happened on September 11, 2001. The sheer scale of the horror. A day that began like any other—clear blue skies, coffee in hand—ended as, for my generation, perhaps the most devastating single act of violence since Hiroshima.

I think often about the victims: the passengers on the planes, the workers in the towers. One moment they were settling into their desks; the next, they were trapped in an inferno with no way out. Some faced the impossible choice between burning alive or jumping. My sister and I watched it all unfold in the late afternoon South African time—but only years later did I realize how early it was in New York. People had barely arrived at work. They didn’t know what was happening. None of us did.

Now, at 34 and having settled in Hong Kong, I’m the same age as many of those who died. Listening to their names read aloud, I’m struck by how many were just beginning their lives—building careers, relationships, futures. And I think of people like Melissa Doi and Christine Olender, whose final phone calls revealed their desperate, dignified efforts to survive. They had no warning. No chance to say goodbye. Their agency was stolen in the most brutal way imaginable.

For years, I questioned why we needed such granular detail—the frame-by-frame replays, the seat maps, the timelines. But recently, I’ve come to see it differently. Those who compile these accounts aren’t obsessed; they’re grieving. Like me, they’re trying—however imperfectly—to reconcile an event that defies reconciliation. Maybe that’s impossible. Maybe the unsettling nature of our thoughts simply mirrors the unsettling truth of what occurred.

Just yesterday, I watched the latest installment of Tucker Carlson’s documentary on the 9/11 Commission. His focus on Building 7—and how its collapse was omitted entirely from the official report—resonated deeply. For the first time in over two decades, I felt a sense of relief: someone was treating the public’s trauma with seriousness, sifting fact from fiction, and challenging a narrative that has long felt incomplete.

Twenty-four years on, life has moved forward—but the echoes of that day remain. Wars were launched, lives upended, communities surveilled and stigmatized. And through it all, many of us have carried a quiet, unresolved grief. So when voices finally emerge that demand transparency, not propaganda, it matters. Not for conspiracy—but for clarity. For dignity. For the families who deserve nothing less than the full truth.

I don’t know if I’ll ever fully make peace with 9/11. But I do know this: remembering—honestly, compassionately, and without distortion—is the least we can do for those who were lost… and for the child I was, watching in disbelief, who never got to unsee it.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p03rx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JehovahsWitnesses/comments/1p03rx0/token_of_appreciation/,Token of Appreciation,"Hello. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle a situation respectfully.

I recently found out that my child’s teacher is a Jehovah’s Witness. I didn’t know this at the start of the school year, and earlier on I had given the classroom/teacher a store gift card, plus made a few small classroom purchases here and there. I’ve also occasionally brought in little “thank you” items for the teacher and aides, like coffee or lip balm during the winter—just small tokens of appreciation.

I only became aware of the teacher’s faith when I learned that the teacher wouldn’t be participating in the school’s Halloween events (the kids still participated, just not the teacher). Now that the semester has ended, I wanted to give a heartfelt handwritten note thanking the teacher because the teacher is truly a wonderful educator. I was also planning to include a small gift card, completely unrelated to any holiday or season. The card does not have a theme and is just an image of nature. 

Separately, but perhaps importantly, I had already planned to give the classroom aides small fall/Thanksgiving-themed goodie bags the week before break. These are just for the aides, not the teacher. 

Now I’m second-guessing myself. Would it be inappropriate or uncomfortable for the teacher if I give the thank-you note and small gift card the same week the other staff are receiving fall/Thanksgiving goodie bags? Should I avoid giving it at that time altogether? Or would it be better to ask the teacher directly, but respectfully, whether they’re comfortable receiving small, non-holiday tokens of appreciation? I absolutely don’t want to put the teacher in an uncomfortable position or seem like I’m ignoring the teacher’s beliefs, but I also genuinely want to express appreciation for the incredible work they’ve done with my child. I’m just not sure which approach is the most considerate.

Any advice would be appreciated!

I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Anyway, I am wondering if I am not doing something correctly. 
I have only been experimenting with the espresso side so far but my grind size is so high (I think and compared to what I am seeing done on Youtube reviews). Right now, my grind size ranges from 15-19 on a double espresso pull and I have been others people’s grind size 5-7.

Now, having kids as a gay couple is complicated. I've been asked this question a million times and I've developed a go-to joke that usually kills:

**""Are we having kids? We're trying, but it hasn't happened yet.""**

I delivered it. He just stared at me. Didn't even smile.

And here's where I f\*cked up.

I thought maybe he didn't hear me over the funeral reception noise. So like an absolute idiot, **I repeated the entire joke. Louder.**

He looked me dead in the eye and said:

**""No, I heard you. Your coffee is getting cold.""**

Then he walked away.

I just stood there holding my cold coffee like a complete moron. My husband was mortified.

Now I'm spiraling:

1. Did I massively misread the room at a *funeral*?
2. Is there some homophobia here despite his son being gay?
3. Should I feel terrible for his son?

I've convinced myself I'll never speak to him again, that I massively embarrassed myself, and that he's shit-talked me to the entire family by now.

Knowing he isn’t to give up on his ill sister, He tends to try and take a step further and also go after Hamilton Hill who is wanting to be elected mayor,  But tragedy also strikes for William only to learn he only has just six months to live, he decides to ramp up his spree after being diagnosed with just a few days to live, particularly going after notable clock towers or using a clock theme in his spree.he decides to ramp up his spree after being diagnosed with just a few days to live, thus particularly going after notable clocktowers or using a clock theme in his spree. 



Batman faces off against The Clock King and faces off with him he does everything to ruin Hill’s image leading to tying him on the clocktower revealing himself to Hill “Fugate, please I just wanted to help you” Hill says scared, “Did you help me when my sister became ill? The Clock King says "" How can you even help me when you barely know the tragic hell I am living in?” Clock King continues as he confronts Hill “No matter, soon you have yourself a reserved date at exactly 3:15pm with the grim reaper” Batman (after learning about Clock Kings past through files) and faces off against the Clock King on the tower, 

William predicting every move Batman makes is evenly skilled but Batman has the upper hand, as Batman tells The Clock King “William, is this is what Priscilla would’ve wanted from you?” William gets angry “What would you know about losing someone? your a vigilante you never get to deal with the grief and loss for someone” 

Batman comes to a comforting voice “I lost more than you think Fugate, I know how it feels to lose someone you truly care for, Priscilla knows your better, So take it from her words, You don’t need to worry about me, Live the life you care for, live the life you want, be the little kid I once knew again” 



William gets emotional letting go as Hill is free and is arrested,    After being apprehended, he learns he was given the wrong diagnosis, but tragically fell short of the amount needed to save his sister's life. After being sent to Gotham State Penitentiary, he soon learns of a news report on the news, “BRUCE WAYNE SAVES SISTER TO NOW ARRESTED WILLIAM FUGATE” a small tear falls on his face seeing that his sister is going to take time but at least recovery is a starting process for her as he weeps in his cell happily

1p03fkc,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-trade-tariff-rollbacks-rcna244339,The Trump administration is racing to reframe his tariff rollbacks,"Trump administration officials are racing to reframe the president's tariff rollbacks, as critics say the White House is capitulating on its signature economic policy.

Late Friday, the White House announced the president had signed an executive order exempting more than 200 food products, including bananas, beef and coffee, from the so-called reciprocal tariffs he has imposed on U.S. trading partners.

The move comes as the trade duties have begun to face economic, legal and political resistance that cast doubt on their efficacy.

Some two-thirds of voters who helped sweep Democrats into power in a host of races earlier this month said President Donald Trump hasn’t lived up to his promises to curb inflation and improve the economy, according to NBC News polling.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court could issue an opinion in the coming months striking down the central argument Trump has made as to why he has the power to apply seemingly arbitrary tariff rates on dozens of countries.

White House officials are insisting the rollbacks do not amount to a retreat from the president's staunch defense of tariffs as an economic driver.

“This is nothing new,"" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday in response to a question of whether the reversals represent an acknowledgement that the policies have contributed to rising costs.

Hassett cited previous moves by the administration to exempt certain products from duties following trade-framework agreements.

One day earlier, Hassett told ABC News' “This Week” that price increases for some goods weren't being solely caused by tariffs — but acknowledged that prices could start coming down as imports into the U.S. climb.

He also sought to blame former President Joe Biden, whose administration oversaw a post-pandemic inflation surge.

“We understand that people still feel the pain of the high prices, but we’re closing the gap fast,” Hassett said.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent likewise sought to cast blame for rising beef prices backward.

""The beef market is a very specialized market,” Bessent began. “It goes in long cycles. And this is the perfect storm, again, something we inherited.”

In addition to Friday's broad rollback of food-related tariffs, Trump also announced Friday that he was significantly reducing tariffs on goods from Switzerland, which had faced some of the highest duties yet announced during Trump’s second term.

A day earlier, the White House said many food products from four Central and South American countries would be exempted from levies after they agreed to trade frameworks with the U.S.

The U.S. economy continues to contend with stubborn inflation — especially for many everyday grocery items. Orange juice prices have increased approximately 29% year on year, while beef costs are up 13.5%, according to the latest NBC News grocery price tracker data.

While some of the factors influencing the cost increases are not directly tied to tariffs, economists have estimated that consumers have been shouldering more than 50% of the overall price increases seen from Trump's import duties.

Businesses and analysts alike continue to sound the alarm on the impact of tariffs, saying they are compounding the stubborn inflation that has taken root since the pandemic and holding back investment decisions.

In a statement Monday, a White House spokesman said the administration remains “committed to the tariff policies that have secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America along with unprecedented trade deals for American workers, industries, and farmers.”

“President Trump’s September 5th executive order specifically laid out various natural resources and agricultural products not produced in the United States that could be eligible for tariff-free treatment in the context of trade deals — the President’s recent tariff announcement reflects how the Administration has now secured a critical mass of trade deals with countries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, and Asia,” spokesman Kush Desai said.

But whether all the products that were most recently exempted from tariffs fall into the category of “not produced in the United States” is doubtful.

In the Friday executive order that rolled back all reciprocal tariffs on certain food products, Trump cited “current domestic demand for certain products, and current domestic capacity to produce certain products.”

That definition goes beyond the strict categories of products the United States does not produce and products from countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements.

It signals that a desire to cool off price increases is increasingly being seen as a justification for tariff exemptions on some products, like beef.

Last week’s announcements are not the first time Trump has signaled a willingness to reconsider his trade stances.

Throughout the spring and summer, the president frequently floated higher duties on a trade partner, usually amid ongoing negotiations, only to backtrack on them later. Some on Wall Street eventually dubbed the inevitable reversals “TACO” — “Trump Always Chickens Out.”

The back-and-forth announcements served to whipsaw markets, with the president often standing down after major stock indexes experienced declines in response to his threats.

It is unlikely tariffs are going away entirely: The White House has signaled it would likely seek to reimpose some duties via other statutes if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s emergency authority.

Just last month, the president announced a slew of new duties on imports including furniture, heavy trucks and pharmaceuticals.

The tariffs have also raised billions in revenues — though even with those increased funds, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said U.S. lawmakers will “need to identify substantially more deficit reduction to put debt on a sustainable path.”

Any ruling that calls for refunds of the collected funds could have unforeseen consequences on the economy.

Still, some analysts say the recent tariff rollbacks may have only just begun.",2,1763442826.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

Not even a big drama; the tiny, sneaky stuff.

Like, I’ll see someone clocked in at 9:02 AM… but I literally watched them walk in with a coffee at 9:25. Or the classic “my friend punched in for me because I couldn’t find parking.” It’s not malicious, it’s just that the system we use is way too easy to bypass. And when you bring it up, you instantly become ""That Manager"".

I don’t want to micromanage, and I don’t want to run around checking CCTV every morning. I just want attendance to be… accurate. That’s it.

What finally helped was switching to something that doesn’t rely on swipe cards or PINs at all. We started using a face recognition attendance system, and honestly the biggest relief was that it removed the “he said, she said” part. No buddy punching, no arguing. People just check in, get on with their day, and I don’t have to play detective.

FeedMe offers a comprehensive all-in-one system that includes POS, QR ordering, inventory and HR management, kitchen display, CRM, accounting, and more. The company currently serves 11,000+ merchants across Southeast Asia and has achieved 10× revenue growth since 2021, with well-known clients like ZUS Coffee, Christine’s Bakery, Salad Atelier, and Hock Kee Kopitiam. CEO Squall Tan says FeedMe aims to become the “Toast of APAC,” leveraging AI to help restaurants forecast demand and streamline operations. This matters because restaurant operations in the region are often fragmented, with many businesses relying on multiple disconnected tools; rising labour costs and tight margins make automation increasingly essential. If successful, FeedMe’s unified, AI-driven platform could reshape how F&B SMEs operate reducing waste, improving margins, and enabling smarter scaling.

While I hid from the quiet that threatened to fill the room if I dared to turn the tv off, Wilbur stretched his body and curved his spine into a crescent moon around the tv remote that laid as useless as I. He stood up and pawed at the empty plastic tub of cheeseballs like he was demanding it to refill itself. “Yea buddy me too..” I muttered as my stomach growled louder than my voice. God, where the hell is Blake. I’m about to start eating Wilbur’s tuna mush if I have to wait any longer. 
The couch creaked and moaned under me as I forced myself up onto my achy feet. The dingy light in the kitchen barely illuminated the walls without the natural light coming in from the windows, but I can’t get behind the idea of the curtains being open at night. I opened the door of the fridge and my knees popped like they always do as I crouched down to see what may still remain in our tiny fridge. I was disappointed but not surprised. Soy sauce, mustard, iceberg lettuce with what was either a small rodent living on it or a large amount of mold, and a whole lot of nothing else. I should probably throw that away soon.
 I thought about showering for the first time in two days but, against my better judgement, I flopped back toward the couch. And as I walked back from the kitchen I took a detour to the front window of our house, I just need to take a peak sometimes. Some feeling down my spine always seems to remind me to rethink my safety for no particular reason. Unsurprisingly nothing was out of the ordinary. The moon shined down on our street just as it always did, onto my car with the rust and scratches that covered it, and the spot for Blake’s car just as empty as it has been since he left. Snow iced over the street, every inch of it looked perfect and fluffy Miss Evans walked her dog down the sidewalk as she always did. But I paused before my next thought. Why's Grant just waiting outside his house across the street? He’s not even moving or knocking. Whatever, Katie will let him in once she realizes he’s waiting. The only light that shined through his house and its closed door was the familiar glow of the aquarium through the window. I took a breath realizing it really is just in my head again, walking back to the couch I let myself fall right back into my spot passing out right then and there. 
	Knock. Knock.
	Two quiet almost taps came from the front door but woke me up just as much as any sound would. 
	“Hey Dev, can you let me in please. Its so fucking cold out here. The snow is really getting to me.” Blake’s voice crept in through the bottom crack in the door. 
	It took me a moment to realize I was awake and not dreaming but slowly got up realizing he forgot his key again. He hasn’t remembered to grab it all week and I’m getting sick of being woken up by him. At least I can eat now. I hobbled over to the door, my head awake but my legs were still ready for bed barely wanting to move. I cracked open the door leaving just enough room for my head to peek through and glare at him through the metal screen type door we had as extra protection in our nice old people filled neighborhood. 
	“Where’s the food Blake.” I could see his face drop from a faint smile to a frown as I blatantly demanded my meal without any first greetings. 
	He sighed before talking back, “Dev please, I’ve had a long day, I’m still getting over Chelsea and I forgot to get anything on the way out.. Please just let me in, you know I hate the cold.” I could see on his face he was tired of my bullshit. But I am not budging.
	“Chelsea broke up with you two months ago and I am fucking starving. Now you have one option here, you drive back to the store, get us some food before it gets too late and I will let you in and we can talk about your day. The store is only a few miles away, you'll be back in 10 minutes or less.” I fought back, refusing to go to bed hungry again.
	He looked pissed, pausing, staring me in the eyes just waiting for me to open the door for a second, it was a bit eerie till he spoke again, “Dev, bro, I’m freezing just standing here waiting. I’m telling you, any longer out here and my blood is going to turn into a slushie and I don’t think my veins can handle–” 
I cut him off when my mind finally caught up to the words he said, “Wait, what do you mean you hate the cold? I only just realized you said that. You and I both know how warmblooded you are. Blake, you went out yesterday in shorts and sandals.. with a foot of snow blocking our door.” 
	He exhaled sharply before just chuckling under his breath, “I don’t know Dev I just haven’t been as warm recently. Honestly can you just let me in though, I’ll grab a jacket and you can come with me and we can go eat out somewhere. I got some extra tips today at work and I can use them to get us a nice dinner, maybe we can go to a steak house or something, let’s go crazy for a night. Just a little bit couldn’t hurt.” He spoke so softly and smoothly now but he started to scratch at his cheek as he attempted to convince me. 
I caught myself staring at his hand more than his face now. The way his nails dragged over his cheek looked too casual at first, but he didn’t stop. Just a light scrape, again and again, until the skin there went red. “You’re bleeding,” I muttered, before I could stop myself.
He said so casually, “Oh shit, my skin must be dry from this weather. Fuck can you let me in I gotta clean this up.” His mouth moved before his face did, like he wasn’t reacting to the pain but my words instead. Like the blood didn’t even bother him. But his voice wasn’t convincing, and the sound of his fingernails pulling away was sharper than it should’ve been, like fabric tearing against itself, leaving a flap that slightly curled over off of his face leaving the raw red meat visible. I looked back behind me after feeling a chill down my spine and realized Wilbur was protected by the couch like a shield, hiding his body and peeked a single eye around the corner. He snickered letting the air breeze breathe through him, “You just look so damn warm in there. You gotta share a little, right?” He chuckled after like he said something funny as I stared blankly at him. “So warm. So soft.”
“Are you on something Blake? Be honest with me right now because something about this is not right. Can you just stay somewhere else tonight?” My voice was shaky as I struggled to keep my body and words steady. I was more uneasy that I’ve ever been.
He stood still staring me in the eyes like he was still just waiting for the answer he wanted and wouldn’t budge without it, “Dev,” he whispered. Softer now. So soft I almost thought I imagined it. “Don’t make me stay out here. I don’t feel like myself.” He said as he placed his face closer to the steel door. His blood left a trail on the open fence, he left a mark on his territory. 
“Blake I can’t deal with this right now, just go rent a motel for a night and I’ll pay you back, if you want to warm up so bad use the heater in your— Blake. Where’s your car?” I wasn’t even thinking before I spoke anymore, the words weren’t making sense, nothing was.  
His eyes flickered for a moment, like he had to remember the right answer, before he finally said, “I didn’t drive.”
I felt the words sink in. “You didn’t drive? Blake, it’s three miles to the store, in a foot of snow. What the fuck do you mean?” My eyes snapped to the right, quick, just a dart before shooting back to him. Left, right, left again, fast enough to keep him in my sight. But I caught it. The hook by the door. Empty. His keys weren’t there. They’re always there. He drills it into me. “Put it back, Dev, put it back, you lose it, that’s your fault.” His voice replayed in my head, smug, certain. But the hook was bare. My chest tightened and I forgot how to breathe for a second. Is he fucking with me?
Blake tilted his head against the door, slow, steady, like he knew what I was thinking. The grin didn’t move but his eyes sharpened. “What’d you see, Dev?”
I opened my fist that I didn’t even remember forming, fighting against the sweaty sticky grab of my palm and fingers. “Nothing,” I said too quickly, my voice cracking. “Nothing, man.. Just please go somewhere else.” 
Blake chuckled under his breath, low and soft, but then it stretched too long, like he was waiting for me to laugh with him. His face fell flat as he locked eyes with me still just inches from the metal, “Dev,” he whispered again, soft as the snow outside. “Please. You don’t even have to open it all the way. Just a little bit.” His face was coming apart the longer he stood there. The skin didn’t sit right on him, hanging too loose, like it had been stitched back on wrong. Every time his cheek twitched the flap tugged lower, tearing at the seams. When he smiled, it wasn’t even a smile anymore, just raw muscle showing through where the corners of his mouth had split. The sound was worse than the sight. Every shift of his expression came with a squelch, a slow peel, like pulling the raw skin from a wet piece of chicken. He tilted his head against the steel door and the skin along his temple slid half an inch out of place before catching on the bone.My stomach turned and my eyes slipped past him without meaning to. Anywhere else. Anywhere that wasn’t that. But something caught my eye in the background, somehow took my attention from this nightmare. Grant’s door was swung wide open, the empty black of his living room looked like a pitch black pit. In the midst of our quiet neighborhood somehow Grant's house seemed even more quiet. When did he go in? How long has that door been open?
Blake cut off my thoughts like he could hear them, like he was thinking with me as he looked back at Grant’s house, “What are you looking at Dev?” He spoke with a grin on his face, the peels now falling lower than they had before. 
“W-where did Grant go Blake? Did you do something to him?” I studdered, it didn’t make sense but I didn’t know what the fuck was wrong with Blake right now, what was going on in his brain. Was it breaking down just as much as his body was right now?
He gave me a condescending look and as he scrunched his eyebrows the skin between them squished like the skin was one size too big. “You've been here with me Dev.. I never moved. I guess they just let him in. He must’ve been cold.” He said without a blink or any sign of an expression other than that same fucking smile. 
The empty black across the street swallowed me whole. The snow around the porch looked untouched, no prints, no sign he’d even gone inside. The house was pitch black no window lit, not a single light, just the empty black of what lay inside. “No,” I muttered under my breath, shaking my head like I could knock sense back into it. 
His laugh came out wrong. Thin, breathy, cut in half like it didn’t belong to him. Blake whispered, “You’re the only one left making this hard Dev.” Wilbur growled again this time at the sound of his words, louder this time, and I could hear his claws scratching the floorboards as he bolted deeper into the house.
I slammed the wooden door in his face just so I could at least imagine I wasn’t in this situation. My fingers missed more times than I could count as I grabbed my phone before I heard the operator,”911, what’s your emergency?” Her voice was the first hope I’ve had since he knocked on my door.
My eyes were locked on the door as I spoke like my body was afraid he still had the key on him. Every syllable rattled in my throat as I tried to whisper just loud enough for her to hear me, “Someone’s outside my house. My roommate. He won’t leave me alone. He’s bleeding, he’s not making sense, I-I think he’s on something.”I checked through the peephole just to make sure he was still there and the sight made me sick. His face was sealed onto the metal door with his eye glaring straight into mine through the lens. For a second it looked like he couldn’t even separate himself from the shield that stood between us, until he tried to move away. He tugged once with no give before he put his hands to the door and pushed with a slow pull as his face peeled off and stuck onto the door like the masks Blake’s girlfriend used to do. The sickly red ooze that stuck kept it on pulled like strings of melted cheese still holding onto his face. The only visual left was his bare muscle and fat that laid underneath and the eyes that sat in their now visible sockets. My words were stuck in my throat so much that I had forgotten that I was even on the phone.
“Who ya talking to Dev? Can I say hi?” And then he smiled.
Honestly it wasn’t a smile anymore, no, not really.The skin was gone, but the muscle still knew the shape. His lips had been stripped away, so the grin looked wider, stretched cruelly across the exposed fat and teeth. And his face was raw and stringy like the flesh of a mango that had been freshly peeled.
“He knows I’m on the phone. Please just send someone. I think he wants to hurt me but I won’t let him in. I don’t even think it’s him anymore.” My words were shaky and my voice low. I tried to whisper so softly directly into the phone that not even I could really hear it.
“Okay just stay calm and quiet, I’m sending someone now, you’re going to be ok. Are you somewhere safe right now? Do you have something to protect yourself?” She spoke clear and calmly, the only sturdy thing in this entire situation. 
“Dev. Don’t make me freeze out here. Please.” I could still hear his smile in his voice and that he still stood just inches from the door. 
“I’m by the front door, I’m just sitting here so I can watch him from the peephole. I’m too scared that if I leave he’ll find a way in.. but I can grab a weapon or something.” We did have any weapons, we barely had silverwear. The only thing I could find as I rummaged through the kitchen was a disappointingly small steak knife. It would have to do. “I uh, found something, I have a knife now.” I paused for a second as I went to return back to the front door to keep watch, the microwave and the green glow of the time made me freeze. 10 P.M. It had already been three hours of him sitting outside. It only felt like a few minutes and an eternity combined so I guess that does even out to about three hours, but it still didn’t make sense how fast time had moved. I kept walking. 
“Can you try to find somewhere safer? Do you have a room you can get into that he can’t get into? Or somewhere you can barricade yourself into? The police are going to be there soon. Any minute.” She spoke more urgently now but still calm, she was trying to stay calm for me. But there was worry behind her voice. 
My mind flashed to the small safe room that we had set up when we first moved in, he knew the passcode when he helped me set it up, but I don't think this is him anymore. But that should be a last resort, “No I can just stay here, I don’t think he can get in.”
“Hey Dev, this glass looks really thin. I wouldn’t want us both to be cold but if you keep acting so weird I might have to find my own way in.” I didn’t hear the smile this time, and his voice sounded different, more scratchy and strained. 
She was right, without  another thought I quietly ran upstairs making sure to skip the creaky step on my way up. Every movement I made no matter how far I was from that door I still felt like I needed to be silent. He could barely talk but I somehow knew that he’d hear me if I made one mistake. He’d know that I was hiding, he’d know where I was hiding. I pushed the wardrobe aside to unveil the open room we had behind it before pulling it back behind me. Both of us were nuts, we knew we were. We’d always ask each other why we’d need a secret safe room, but we still always wanted peace of mind. I needed it today, just felt weird being in here without him. A few minutes passed, my heart seemed to calm and I felt genuinely safe. That wasn’t him out there, he couldn’t know where I am. Besides, the police are about to take care of it. How are they even going to take care of it? His- his skin was falling off like melted rubber. Can he even be saved? Can I?
“Hey are you still there?” the operator’s voice snapped through the phone, crisp and too loud in the stillness. She spooked me. “Stay with me. I’ve got two units almost on your street. You should see their lights any second now. Just stay in there ”
I held my breath, straining. For the first time all night, I heard something besides Blake’s faint breathing through the door. The sirens blared through the street, it felt wrong how loud they were through the completely quiet street. Even so, even through the sirens, even all the way up here behind this wardrobe, I felt like I could still hear his breathing. It was directly in my ear. Like he was breathing right through into my soul as it whispered its way up my spine. “They’re here,” I whispered.
She whispered back in the same second like she was anticipating those words, “Good, just stay hidden. They are going to take care of this, just let them handle this.” 
Her words seemed like the only ones I should follow, but I couldn’t. What if they came to the front and I wasn’t there.. if Blake tried something while I sat in a closet doing nothing- no. I had to see it. I pushed the wardrobe aside as quietly as I could and crept down the stairs, every step fighting against the scream in my bones telling me to stay put. Then my body screamed even louder as I forgot about the creaky stair, it squealed as I squished it under my foot. The sirens squealed louder so I kept walking. The dispatcher kept talking, asking me to just stay put and stay safe, almost begging me knowing that something more than I could handle stood outside. She didn’t know what monstrosity waited for her officers. I didn’t even know. 
Looking through the peephole felt like watching a snuff film, something I would’ve seen in middle school, part of the reason I was so paranoid for sure. Blake was still facing the door and as soon as I had a chance to see him his blank stare turned into a smile again. Tires crunching over snow. Doors slamming shut. Heavy boots. 
“Welcome back Dev! Just couldn’t stay away?” He spoke with joy in his voice like he was excited to know I was back. How did he know I was back?
Their voices sounded like an oasis in the midst of a desert. “Sir, step away from the door and put your hands where I can see them!” The authority behind his voice made me quiver. Blake didn’t flinch. I could imagine it, the scalding heat blistering my back, the sand burning my feet numb to the pain and the taste of bare flesh as my tongue begged for water. I was stuck in the desert.. and I saw no oasis. It was a mirage. 
Blake gave me one last smirk with his skinless lips and bare face. More skin had fallen off, now his arms were missing patches and his shirt was blood soaked. He turned around toward the officers with his hands comfortably above his head. The officer behind the first nearly dropped his gun at the sight of him. I couldn’t stand the sight but I couldn’t look away either. The other officer staggered, frozen, weapon shaking in his hands as he stared at Blake, who only grinned with his raw muscle and teeth. I heard his partner scream next as I was made to watch him put the gun to his head. As soon as the other officers' light met Blake he froze. Blake smiled, I could feel that fucking smile even though he was turned away from me. I could even see the muscles around the sides of his face contort to make a grin. 
“What’s happening Devin? Are you ok?” The dispatcher tried to interrupt but nothing could take my attention away. 
His hands met his throat and he clawed again, opening his thick exposed veins to the open air. Blood slowly came out in globs like a thick chocolate pudding, like it had curdled and creamed through the night into something just as sickly sweet as it was sticky and revolting. The officer was silent and unable to move an inch. Until he too raised his gun like he had seen more than his mind would let him. He pulled the trigger too, like his body didn’t want the trauma of life after this. Both bodies laid on the ground flat like two dolls that a child played with too roughly. Their open wounds painted the street and their blood filled the snow like the syrup to a snowcone. And Blake stood still, and I could only guess still smiling. 
The dispatcher spoke louder now basically yelling, I had only now noticed she was talking to me this entire time just waiting for a response, “Devin! Are you ok? What’s happening? Where are the officers? Where is the man?” I couldn’t respond to her words, I couldn’t even attempt to move my hand back up to my ear. 
Blake turned around slowly and deliberately. His face didn’t move. Why the fuck is he still smiling? What is wrong with him? Why me? Why me? Why? He was almost fully raw now. The thin layer of skin that remained scattered around his body like an unfinished puzzle curled and pulled away from the meat that still held on to the bone like he was trying to shed- shed every last piece of him that still clung on. Like he wanted to return to an empty canvas and repaint his face the way he now chose it to be— Breathe. Just breathe.
The silence was nonexistent. Filled with my quick deep breaths nearly suffocating to the amount of oxygen I took in. His controlled slow breaths matched a slower tempo to mine. Every three breaths I gave he shared one with me in unison. Like he was timing his breathing to match mine, his mouth had to be  nearly against the door with how loud it was. It sounded like a whirlwind whipped around the street, it was just his struggling lungs giving out raspy breaths. 
“Hey Dev? I’m kinda cold out here. Can you let me in? I’m almost ready for you. I just want a little bit of your skin.” My eye was still glued to the peephole as he walked closer. “Just a little bit, you can share, right?” 
The dispatcher's words caught me again as I finally got the strength back to pull the phone back in. “Devin I need you to tell me are the officers ok? What is happening?” 
“They’re dead. He didn’t even kill them. They just saw him and- I don’t know what to do.” I tried to calm myself as I spoke to her. If he wanted to break in he would’ve by now. He wants permission.
There was a pause on the phone call for an uncomfortably long time, “Devin what does he want? Has he asked you for anything?” She sounded so disappointed in the way she spoke. 
I tried to talk more quietly than I ever had, I just didn’t want him to know I was still on the phone with her, that she could still send more help. I whispered,”I-I know it sounds crazy but.. he’s asking for my skin”
She let out a sigh, not one of relief but of sorrow and grief, like she knew I had no hope. She said back stoic and calm,”I’m sorry. God help you.” The three hang up beeps haunted me, she didn’t even give me a second thought. 
“Hey Dev, you know.. I know you were up in our safe room. I can come up behind the wardrobe if you want, we can hide there until sunrise so you won’t be scared anymore.” He didn’t give me a moment to grieve the death of the only hope I had. My pulse scrambled out of rhythm, I pressed my hand against my mouth to hold in a sound I didn’t even realize was clawing its way out of me. He knew. He fucking knew. How the fuck does he know? That isn’t him.. that can’t be. Or is it? Did he catch something? Is he turning into a fucking werewolf? I squeezed my eyes shut until stars burst in the dark and forced myself to breathe slow, steady, quiet. One in, one out. He wasn’t in the house. Not yet. I repeated it to myself like a prayer, a spell, anything to keep my hands from shaking the knife right out of my grip. 
He still breathed directly into the door, I was just happy I wasn’t looking through the peephole anymore, I didn’t want to see what he had become. How far could this go?
“Or you could just give me a little bit. I’m not asking for much, you just look so damn warm.” He began to beg almost, he didn’t sound like he was demanding it, just asking and pleading. 
“Go the fuck away Blake! Just go the fuck away!” I screamed it at him. I screamed so loud it felt like I tore up my vocal cords. 
He took in a big sigh, he sounded disappointed like he expected me to greet him with open arms. We’ve never been that close, not in a long time and definitely not tonight. He coughed and then spoke so clearly,”Maybe you’re right Dev. I'll try to find somewhere else to get warm.” I could feel him pause after he spoke, waiting for me to call out to him, to beg him to stay. No, I stayed silent, not a word slipped from my mouth. He gave one last breath before I heard the snow crunching away. I watched the clock on the microwave from the door as I sat still frozen for the next two hours but it felt like it still wasn’t enough time. I couldn’t move, how could I? 
The green clock on the microwave blinked at me every few minutes to remind me I was still trapped in this grey-scaped purgatory. The minutes felt like hours and the hours like days but I didn’t move. I couldn’t. 
He’s gone. I heard him. 
Still the crunch of the snow was like a fleeting memory. So cemented in my mind but more as the same feeling of a dream after you wake up than a factual moment I had lived. It just didn’t feel true. 
It couldn’t be that easy.
The silence and the weight to the air knitted themselves into a blanket and wrapped my world in a thin blanket that couldn’t be as warm as it seemed. It couldn’t be. The house groaned with the wind, every sound had intent, a heavy weight that drove a wedge between me and my own peace. I caught myself holding my breath so long my chest ached, but I didn’t dare let the silence grow without me in it. Wilbur had taken to pacing in the kitchen, claws tapping against the tile in nervous little bursts. He’d stop, sit, stare at the back hallway like he expected someone to walk in. Then he’d dart away again, tail stiff, fur prickled along his back. I clutched the steak knife tighter, and the handle sweated with me. My palm stuck to it, tacky, slippery in the same second. It felt more like a toy than a weapon. Every time I adjusted my grip, the blade caught the green glow of the microwave, flashing at me, reminding me how thin it was. A useless thing.
My mind went numb to the time, still I heard every noise that passed by my ear but the minutes finally flew through my night. I blinked. No, fell  asleep. I must’ve. I looked back up at the green glow as my eyes shot open, 6:38 A.M.. 
The house was lighter now, faint blue seeping through the curtains, but the weight of night hadn’t lifted. It only shifted, thinner, stretched out, easier to see through but still there. The silence wasn’t gone, only different. A colder silence. One that watched instead of smothered. My whole body buzzed like I’d been holding my breath the entire time, but my chest rose and fell too fast for that to be true. I wiped at my eyes with the heel of my hand, forcing them to stay open, to focus. Wilbur hadn’t moved from the kitchen. His back was to me, his fur puffed up into a shape I barely recognized, tail twitching like a clock hand out of rhythm. He hissed suddenly, sharp and wet, the sound slicing through the stillness like glass snapping in my ears. He wasn’t looking at the front door anymore. His eyes locked on the back hallway.
I turned toward the hallway but my body tried to fight me like it knew better. My steps stuck to the floorboards, each one slow and reluctant. The house itself didn’t want me to move forward. Wilbur’s ears flattened as his eyes tracked something I couldn’t see. I followed his gaze into the shadows stretching past the kitchen, past the laundry room, toward the back door. The light outside barely touched it but I could still see the frost spiderwebbing across the glass. All the hair on the back of his neck down to the base of his spine rose. 
I felt my bones try to jump out of my own body when a mouse scurried out from the trashcan that sat by the door. Wilbur leaped and pounced onto it, taking its life as soon as it believed itself to be safe. Cruel but deserved. The mouse had no way to fight and no where to run. It was doomed as soon as Wilbur decided it was his prey for the night. Hunters are made to hunt. Prey are made to be preyed upon. I was prey. 
The back door this time  knocked for three times once more before I heard that all too familiar smiling voice. 
“Goodmorning Devin. I’ve been patient, and it’s still cold. I might just have to take it from you if you won’t let me.” 
6:42 A.M.

1p036vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1p036vh/how_stacking_tiny_habits_completely_flipped_my/,How Stacking Tiny Habits Completely Flipped My Productivity (And My Life),"For years, I thought being productive meant doing huge, life-changing routines. I imagined people waking up at 5 AM, meditating for an hour, journaling in perfect neat handwriting, doing push-ups until their arms burned, and then magically finishing the day with a spotless apartment and zero stress.

I tried all of it. Every morning was a cycle of hype, energy, and then crashing by 9:30 AM. I’d binge-scroll Reddit while thinking about all the things I *should* be doing: gym, cleaning, side projects, learning new skills. It felt like I was trying to sprint a marathon before my coffee even kicked in.

One evening, completely frustrated, I realized I was overthinking everything. The problem wasn’t willpower. It wasn’t motivation. It wasn’t even time. The problem was scale. I kept trying to do *all the things at once*.

So I tried something ridiculously small: I started stacking **micro-habits**.



# What I Did

Instead of planning to write an essay, clean the apartment, and workout in a single night, I broke everything into **tiny actions that took less than 2 minutes**.

* Open my laptop → write *one sentence*
* Walk past my laundry → throw in one load
* Enter the kitchen → wash one dish
* Walk to my closet → fold one shirt
* Open notebook → write down one idea

That’s it. That’s all. Micro. Ridiculously small. But here’s the kicker: once I started, the momentum carried me forward. That single sentence became a paragraph. One dish became a sinkful. One shirt became an entire pile folded and organized.

I stacked these tiny actions together throughout the day. Every micro-habit was a tiny victory, and those victories snowballed.



# Why This Works

Humans are wired to resist starting large tasks. Our brains overestimate difficulty, fear failure, and procrastinate. By starting *so small that you can’t fail*, you trick your brain into doing work.

Science backs this up:

* **The Zeigarnik Effect:** your brain remembers incomplete tasks and nudges you to finish them.
* **The Snowball Effect of Small Wins:** completing tiny tasks triggers dopamine, making you want to continue.
* **Activation Energy:** starting a task requires mental energy. Micro-habits lower the energy threshold so you *actually start*.

It’s not about effort. It’s about **making the first step inevitable**. Once the first step is done, the second becomes easier, and the third even easier.



# How I Implemented It

I created a simple system:

1. **Pick the areas that drain me most** (work, cleaning, learning, health)
2. **Identify the tiniest possible action in each area**
3. **Stack them together** across the day
4. **Celebrate every micro-win**, even if it seems trivial

For example:

* Morning: make bed → brush teeth → one sentence in journal
* Work: open email → respond to *one* message → start draft of report
* Evening: fold one item of laundry → wash one dish → prep one meal

Each small win triggers momentum for the next. After a few weeks, I was completing tasks I used to avoid for months.



# Results After 2 Months

* My apartment was finally livable — clutter didn’t pile up anymore
* I consistently hit my work deadlines
* I started learning new skills and actually finishing tutorials
* I went to the gym 3–5 times a week without forcing myself
* My stress levels dropped drastically
* I felt accomplished *daily*, instead of waiting for a huge, impossible “perfect day”

Even small micro-habits, done consistently, create massive results.



# Tips for Success

1. **Start ridiculously small** — if it takes longer than 2 minutes, break it down.
2. **Stack micro-habits** — link one tiny action to another for momentum.
3. **Track tiny wins** — write them down, check them off, feel the dopamine.
4. **Ignore the finish line** — focus on *starting* and *doing small wins*.
5. **Be consistent** — small daily wins are better than giant weekly efforts.



# Why This Changed My Life

Before, productivity felt like a mountain I could never climb. One big task paralyzed me. Now, with micro-habit stacking, mountains become staircases. The key isn’t doing more — it’s starting small, consistently, and letting momentum carry you.

Micro-habit stacking isn’t just a productivity hack — it’s a mindset shift. It rewires your brain to value starting, finishing, and celebrating small wins. It turns overwhelm into flow. It turns procrastination into progress.



# Final Thought

If you feel stuck, overwhelmed, or exhausted by your to-do list:

* Pick one tiny habit.
* Do it now.
* Stack another.

Don’t wait for motivation. Don’t wait for energy. Start small, and watch your life transform, one tiny win at a time.",2,1763442059.0,NoStupidQuestions,5,0.67,False

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

In that time, his parents never got us a wedding present. They did get us a coffee maker as a housewarming gift 3 years ago. They never got me any Christmas or birthday gifts all this time. I honestly don't expect anything from them. 

My husband and I brought them gifts and we always pay for restaurants whenever we go out with them (except for 3 times, and all other times we paid). We bought them nice (expensive) gifts and took them to nice restaurants. We love them and didn't expect anything in return.

They have repeatedly been insisting that we tell them what we want for Christmas. The first three Christmases I didn't ask for anything and neither did my husband. My mother in law seemed offended that we never told them what we wanted for Christmas.​

 This time I responded to their text requesting a ceiling light/fan on sale for $150 because it's something my husband would enjoy and we actually need to replace the light.

I didn't get any response from them and I didn't think much of it. My mother in law called my husband to complain how rude I am for sending the link to the specific gift we wanted. Wtf?!

I didn't even say anything to them and I told my husband that his parents were the ones who kept insisting to buy us Christmas gifts. He knows this is the case because of group chats and when we have a video call about once a month his mom will insist that she has to buy us gifts (and we always declined, even when she bragged about coming into big money).

I don't care about the present. It's the malicious action on her part that offends me. She has a history of checking her husband's phone and messages. I sent him a veterans day greeting on his phone and it was not respond to even though he responds within an hour usually.

I just feel ridiculous for even asking for the Christmas present for our house for something only my husband would use anyway. I blocked his parents accounts on social media after I saw recent lurking on my profile (they don't follow me, just check out my profile a few times a day). The block has nothing to do with the present; I just felt invaded when I learned that they (most likely the mom) were lurking on my profile several times a day without interacting with my posts. I told my husband about it and he tried to make it seem like I'm the problem for even having social media.

Little back story, I got norovirus in March of this year and since then my stomach and throat have not been the same.

It got really bad in June, my anxiety was so bad and I was so concerned all the time with vomiting (I have a fear of vomiting) so I wouldn’t eat anything, I think I went two days without eating.. maybe I had a cracker or two. The nausea is never ending, it’s like it’s an every day thing and it has totally changed me as a person. The acid taste in my mouth is an indescribable pain. The mucus in the back of my throat is AWFUL, sometimes i can literally feel a chunk of food in the back of my throat and I just force myself to swallow 100 times, I also sometimes get dysphagia. Sore throat is common too, also the amount of GAS that I have is insane but sometimes it feels like it’s the only way to feel better. These past few months have been a nightmare, I’ve lost 50 pounds and I’m severely underweight for my height and age, my anxiety got so bad that I underwent TMS therapy, ketamine therapy and I had to leave my job for three months and then I got diagnosed with GERD. 

I’m on pantoprazole, I do yoga every morning and a walk in the evening, for breakfast I always have something with bread because I hear that bread absorbs acid more. I’m also on quetiapine to make me hungrier and I take the at night and lexapro in the morning. I take a probiotic every morning, I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t smoke weed, I do vape but I’ve been vaping for about a year and I’ve been fine up until June. I drink so much water, I drink decaf coffee and tea on occasion, I drink ginger ale on occasion when it’s really bad. I don’t eat anything 5 hours before bed, my sleep schedule is kinda shitty. I’ve gotten my blood checked and my thyroid checked and nothing has come back, my doctor just says it’s severe OCD, anxiety and GERD but there HAS to be something else…right?? I mean sometimes I feel like death is better than this. I’ve hurt myself in the past in hopes that if I cause pain elsewhere then my GERD pain will go away, unfortunately it doesn’t work that way, but this condition has caused me to seriously consider taking my life, I’ve spent hours on the phone with 988.
I don’t know how people live with this and I just need help or suggestions or just someone to tel me that it gets better. 

I know I said I have a fear of vomiting but I’ve tried making myself vomit twice in just the past week but I also hear forcing myself to vomit on an empty stomach will just make it worse but what the hell else am I supposed to do?? When I do force myself to vomit, nothing comes up. I’m so tired of feeling this way ",2,1763441766.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

My alarm would go off, I’d smack snooze like it owed me money, and then I'd lay there scrolling, telling myself “just ten minutes to wake up.” Next thing I knew it was 45 minutes later, I was late, rushing around like a gremlin, skipping breakfast, stressed before the day even began.

The whole time I’d think about all the things I *wanted* to do: make breakfast, stretch a bit, maybe journal, actually get ready like a functioning human. But nope. TikTok had me hostage. And the crazy part? Every morning I’d promise myself, “Tomorrow will be different.” Nah, it wasn't.

Then one random morning, I don’t know what snapped in me, but instead of grabbing my phone, I just… stood up.  
Literally stood up out of bed before touching anything.

It felt unnatural, like I was glitching.  
But I walked to the sink, splashed water on my face, and made myself a quick breakfast. Nothing aesthetic or inspirational. Just toast and quiet.

Did it again the next day.  
And the next.  
Three days turned into a week. A week turned into two months. Now it’s been almost a year.

I'm not suddenly one of those hyper-productive “rise and grind” people, but the difference? Insane.  
• I actually eat in the mornings now  
• I’m not sprinting out the door with regret in my eyes  
• I’m calmer throughout the day  
• My mood improved without me doing anything fancy  
• I’m actually excited to wake up sometimes (???)

And no, I didn’t magically become a morning person. I just stopped starting my day with a dopamine slot machine.

Weekends I still sleep in or scroll a bit, but it’s intentional now, not survival mode. And weirdly, even my weekends feel better. I go on walks, clean a bit, or just chill without guilt.

If you're stuck in that morning doomloop, try this:  
**For three days, don’t touch your phone when you wake up. Just get up.**  
Do anything else. Make coffee, stretch, stare at the wall, literally anything.

Do you read comics or watch sci-fi and fantasy shows/movies?

Do you know the difference between a Warhammer and a Warcraft?

Do you think vampires are pretty awesome in theory but usually come off as lame?

Do you quote comedies from 20 years ago as if they came out last month?

Do you enjoy puns or words of inspiration with the occasional side of sobering depression?

If you answered yes to any of these…you probably got bullied in junior high. That’s okay, me too.

Let’s just say it’s been a year. I’ve overcome multiple surgeries, lost a number of friends, rekindled my relationship with a few others, and adopted some kittens. I tend to take things in stride and convey an outer demeanor of cool and calm. But honestly? It’s been stressful and…kinda sad. Just some context, because that’s how I do.

I’m looking for real friends. I’m seeking a person (or group of people) that I look forward to chatting with regularly and maybe even hanging out with in person (eventually) if you’re local. I want to talk about nerdy shit and not feel like I’m rambling at somebody. Maybe I can join your D&D group, or we can start a new one together. Perhaps you enjoy writing like I do and you’ll assist me in working on a ttrpg of our own? At the very least we can trade daily cat pics.

I definitely want someone I can talk about games with, but ideally somebody who isn’t cynical and miserable about the industry and everything it puts out. I enjoy my dorky hobbies and I want to chat with others who are passionate about the same things. With any luck we can find something to play together even. I’m not really into competitive shooters and stuff like that but I enjoy cooperative games and got back into WoW recently. Hey, we all make mistakes… Repeatedly.

I don’t care about your background or preferences (and I mean that in a nice way.) I get along with all sorts and always have. I’d prefer if you’re left-leaning though. Tolerance and compassion go a long way. I’m not into drugs and don’t drink much. I’m not looking for any drama. If you happen to like cats, coffee, heavy metal, and adult animation, then you’re already my type of person.

Lastly, I’m a tall, bald white guy with glasses and a beard. Yes, we’re everywhere on Reddit. But where I differ from the common Caucasian Poindexter is that I’m very chill and adaptable. I’m an uber nerd that has honed his skills (insert montage) to behave like a normal human. I’m generally funny, patient, and kind, but still use copious amounts of profanity. I’m usually open to new things, just don’t try to get me to go hiking with you. At the end of the day, I do have some decent people around me and some wonderful cats, but what I’m missing is people who like the stuff I like, as much as I like it.

Is that too much to ask for? Maybe. At a glance, Reddit seems like an ocean with lots of fish in it, but it’s really a fuckton of smaller ponds that fish like to move between and dabble in but by the very nature of this setup the “fish” don’t typically commit to things and treat it all like it’s transient and anonymous and therefore doesn’t truly matter. And I get it, but that’s also unfortunate. Now I can’t guarantee that I’ll be the dopest person you’ve ever met, but I’ll most likely reply and give it a shot. If you’ve messaged other people on here before, you’ll know that’s a pretty good start…",1,1763441308.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

*(Both posts contain the following text)*

So this probably sounds a bit harsh, but that is mostly why I am here to get advice from random strangers on the internet.

I will try to keep the backstory short, my ""Mother"" and my Dad had me when she was 19 and he was 22, they had a turbulent and short marriage, it was dysfunctional to say the least mostly because they only married because of me, they were together for about 4 years before my ""Mother"" walked out, filed for divorce and moved on, my dad got full custody largely because she fully allowed it.

I am now 22, doing well in life and I owe it all to my dad and my grandparents(From Fathers side), they were always there for me, my dad worked his ass of his entire life to provide for me, he is pretty much the perfect father in a lot of ways and I love him very very dearly. My mother on the other hand, last I heard from her was when I was 12 when I received a birthday card from her with a picture of her new family, now imagine barely remembering your ""mother"" and receiving a birthday card with a picture of the person who was supposed to be your mother looking happy surrounded by strangers and two little girls in her and her husbands arms, I'll admit I always pretended it did not bother me but it crushed me inside and led me to act out during my early teens, luckily my dad was there to get me back on track.

I forgot about them more or less, I pretty much realized that at the end of the day I simply did not have a mother, I had my dad who was in essence both my mom and my dad and I had my grandparents to pick up the slack where my dad couldn't.

2 days ago I got a message on a social media account from one of my half-sisters, she sent me a long message in which she told me her name, how old she is (17) How old her sister is (15) and that they had known about me all along but never quite new how to approach me, but that she really, really wanted to meet her brother(Me) and that her mother also also wanted to get back in touch with me and some sob story about how their mom would always cry about me on my birthday, she started telling me about her life, her family, basically the message was really, really long.

Well I figured since she couldn't help what happened and since she was not to blame I would at least properly respond to her, which I did, I introduced myself, told her how old I am, told her what I was studying, what I did as a job on the side, about my dad, my grandparents and so forth, just to at least give her a little look inside my life so she could end her attempt to get to know me and get some closure. I ended the message by making clear to her that I resented my mother and that she should not cry about ""losing me"" given she signed me away to my dad without a moment of doubt and that I was sorry I never got to meet them(My Half Sisters) but I had no interest in getting to know them now or be a part of their lives and I especially had no interest in knowing my ""Mother"" and as far as I was concerned she could go kick rocks.

*(This portion is unique to the version posted to relationship\_advice)*

I got a message back within the hour where my Half-Sister, explained that their mother had always told them that after a lot of fighting in court my dad ended up getting full custody because she was ""In a bad place"" and that she always missed me terribly but was not allowed to see me, she basically started to beg me to please get to know them as they really want me in their lives and she always wanted a big brother and she heard so much great things about me from their mom and so forth.

So I send another message back stating that their mother had been lying to them (Which I know for a fact mind you, it wasn't something my dad put in my head, he even made up excuses for my ""mom"" until I was 14 to spare my feelings.) She signed away her rights without a fight and moved on to have a new family and a new life, I then told her that whatever her mother had told them was stuff she could pretty much forget given their mother has no idea who I am, who I was or who I became, I literally have heard nothing from her and send her nothing since that one birthday card and that I was really sorry but I do not need the drama in my life and I do not want to know them.

This is where I really started to feel bad as she send another message begging me to at least please get coffee with her just once. Which I have yet to reply to.

The reason I am feeling conflicted is because part of the reason I might be unwilling to even entertain the idea of getting to know my Half-Sisters is because of the resentment I have towards my ""mother"" and the fact if I do this I give her a route in to my life and frankly I just want nothing to do with especially her, I don't want to hear about her, I don't want to see her, I don't want to talk to her, I want absolutely nothing to do with her, ever. She is not my mother, my dad is both my Mother and my Father, he earned that, she is in my mind the \*\*\*\*\* That birthed me, I honestly need advice, I am not sure how to go about it, different perspectives from different people might help, given that I am in part emotionally charged so I may not be thinking clearly.

**SELECTED COMMENTS FROM OOP**

*Two of OOP's responses to comments in AmItheAsshole*

> Alright let me just clarify something since apparently it is some people's logical response to question my father's integrity. I could not go in to full detail concerning my father and mothers relationship and honestly felt it was rather irrelevant to the topic at hand, but let me clarify some things.
> 
> There was no physical abuse in their relationship, how do I know this? Because I did not just hear the story from my dad(Who actively tried to minimize my mother's guilt I might add) But I heard it from their mutual friends, my grandparents, my dad's sister(Who'm he does not get along with so she has no reason to say anything positive about him). As for their relationship in general it was not good, they fought a lot, they did not get along, my ""Mom"" hated that she had to give up her ""future"" and my dad hated how she was lazy around the house while he had to work a shitton. Point is their divorce was inevitable and in a lot of ways mutually earned.
> 
> As for the custody battle or lack there of, I have seen proof of most of this and first hand accounts from people there, my mother literally gave up custody, where as my father was prepared to have shared custody, there was hardly a legal battle to begin with beyond sharing what little they had and her being tasked to pay child support(Haha that's a good one, given she didn't), there were no messages, no attempts at reaching out and no letters beyond the one birthday card.
> 
> Sure I heard one side supported by literally everyone and minimized by my father to spare my feelings, but even if there is some huge thing I did not know about (Which there isn't) how exactly does that somehow make her being gone my entire life okay?
> 
> Right let's go with your theory that my dad is a horrible, vindictive, sob story creating monster who beat her to a pulp daily(Which is all not true) So, she figured...Oh let's sign away my rights and leave my kid with that man! YAY Good idea!
> 
> The reality is I'll likely never know the complete, exact, fully unbiased details of everything that happened, what I do know is that my dad took his responsibility, raised me alone since I was a goddamn toddler, provided me with everything I needed both emotionally and financially and made me feel wanted and loved my entire life. Where as my ""Mother"" whatever her sob story might be, ditched me and walked off to screw some new dude and have 2 more kids.

*(In response to a commentator's comment that his mother loves him:)*

> Of course she does, she loves me so much I haven't seen her in 18 years, gosh she sure loves me a lot, but hey at least she sent me a birthday card once with a picture of her new family! Gosh I could just feel the love radiating from it! Nah, my egg donor can go ahead and drive into a ravine as far as I am concerned.

*OOP's responses to comments in Relationship\_Advice*

> Apparently they live roughly 2 hours away from where I live, so yeah they live close enough to swing by and leave in the evening (This is news to me) So yeah despite living basically within a stones throw not a word until this 17 year old girl reached out.

*In response to a comment that were he OOP, ""letting these people in my life because it would be a betrayal to the father who gave up everything for me""*

> I agree it would be a betrayal to let my mother in to my life, but he does not have to worry about that, the issue I am having is with whether or not to meet these half-sisters, I sort of feel bad for them.

- transport to the resort/park 
- specialty coffee
- sweet treats 
- her annual pass for the parks, which for her whole family is around $250 per month 

On bigger splurge days at Disney, she spends money on: 
- sit down meals 
- quick service meals (I’m including this in the bigger splurge category because there are days she only sticks to snacks/coffee)
- merchandise (especially if her mom is coming along) 
- special events not included in what the annual pass holder card covers (this includes the special Halloween and Christmas events) 
- staycations at Disney resorts 

Outside of Disney, she’ll be seen spending money on: 
- pre packaged and pre prepared frozen meals that retail at a higher price than just getting the ingredients and making the food homemade 
- DoorDash 
- Fast food (may or may not be from DoorDash) 
- specialty coffee 
- streaming services (she for sure has Disney+, but I’m unsure of what other streaming services she uses) 
- expensive athletic clothes (especially from brands like Popflex, Lilly Pulitzer, Loveshack Fancy, and Lululemon) 
- makeup (she wears way more than the average woman, and I can only imagine how high her monthly makeup bill is, especially if she gets it all at Sephora) 
- Disney branded home decor (some of it she does buy at the parks, but she’ll also get a considerable amount of it from places like Pottery Barn) 
- cosmetic procedures (she goes on the lower end of this, but that doesn’t mean it’s cheap. She got her eyebrows microbladed and gets cosmetic dental work done that she arguably doesn’t need) 
- press on nails (not as expensive as getting acrylics done at a salon, but can easily add up with monthly recurring purchases) 
- hair extensions 
- fake lashes 

There’s probably more I’m missing, but it’s no wonder her finances are a mess. A lot of what she purchases is unnecessary in the quantity it’s in, and these are spending habits you’d need a six figure salary for to maintain. She also has been taking vacations/staycations multiple times per year, and her Hawaii trip from a bit over a year ago cost around $15K. The cruise is probably going to be within that range, or possibly more, if she goes heavy on the add-ons like alcohol, sweets, and specialty coffees.

But for anyone with a fully functioning brain cell, it was murder. 

I remember practising times tables when the door to our classroom flew open, and in walked the sheriff with a wide smile. 

He had some *super, fun, exciting news for us!*

So exciting that he used three adjectives. 

""Children!” The Sheriff greeted us with a wide smile. 

He had a PowerPoint presentation he wanted to show us. 

The title was punchy, on a bright green background. 

**THE FUTURE WORK INITIATIVE**. 

His assistant, a smartly dressed woman, clicked a button, leading us to the first slide, an enlarged photo of the map of America. 

The sheriff immediately dived into the presentation. 

“Okay! So, how many adults do you think are currently unemployed?” 

Isabella stuck up her hand. “50?”

I figured I’d guess, raising my arm. “100?”

“100 billion?” Gracie giggled from the back, half of the glass snorting with her. 

“That was a rhetorical question,” the sheriff said. “Right now, about *four* out of one hundred people in this country, are out of work. Now, that doesn't sound like a lot, but in reality, it's a very scary statistic.” His expression hardened, his eyebrows coming together like little furry caterpillars. 

He turned to the PowerPoint presentation. 

“However! I am very excited to announce that we will be the very first town to implement the Future Work Initiative, which will help you guys—” his grin widened. “—get yourselves into work!”

The classroom filled with groans and stifled laughter. 

*“Is he serious?”*

Casper’s hand instantly shot up, and I rolled my eyes. The smartest kid in the class *always* had something to say. 

The sheriff looked delighted that he was getting some kind of reaction that wasn't twenty pairs of dazed eyes and agape mouths. “Yes, young man! The kid with the cartoon hat.”

Casper’s lip curled. He tugged his beanie over his curls, speaking with emphasis. “Actually, it's *Dragon Ball*.”

“Ask your question, kid.”

“I'm ten years old,” Casper said, an ironic drawl to his tone. “I’m not old enough for a job.” He folded his arms, leaning back in his chair.

“Obviously.”

“Me too!” Blue waved her arms, scowling. “I'm not even in high school yet! I can't get a job, I don't even know *how* to work!

The sheriff's smile was getting a little scary. 

“I'm not talking about now,” he told us. “I'm talking about the future! When you will be an adult!”

He gestured for his assistant to continue the PowerPoint, and this time we were looking at a photo of a sad looking high schooler grasping her diploma to her chest. I remember suddenly feeling nauseous, phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

“Amy didn't get into her favorite college,” The Sheriff spoke up, gesturing to the screen. “So, do you want to guess what she did?”

When none of us responded, his smile darkened. “Amy decided not to get a job– and Amy is not the only one. When teenagers do not get into their ideal college to further their education, they lose their incentive to find a job, and get very sad.”

The next slide displayed an image of a crying man. 

The sheriff turned to us, his eyes wide. “How many of you want to go to college?”

All of us raised our hands, and I'll never forget the look of disappointment on his face. 

""That's where you're all wrong,"" he said. ""Children go to college for leisure. They don’t care about the jobs they’ll get afterward—because there are no jobs for the subjects these people choose to study.”

This time, he slammed his fist against the board, and half of us nearly jumped out of our chairs.

""Have you ever seen a job listing for—let’s say—French film? No. Children attend college to be educated, but they are not educated. They come out brainless, unable to find even the simplest work, and our great country loses its precious workforce.”

He pointed to Emma. 

“You. What's your favorite food?”

Emma looked startled, her cheeks going pink. 

“Um, uhhh, pizza?”

“Pizza won't exist without someone making it for you,” he said. 

“In fact, if the person making your pizza decided to go to college to study ridiculous subjects like *science*, and ‘diseases’, when we already know how we get sick– and we *already* know what makes us sick! Young lady, your favorite pizza wouldn't exist without that worker.”

I didn't fully understand the presentation, leaning over my desk to my seat-mate, Kaian. “What is he talking about?”

Kaian shrugged, a pencil lodged between his teeth, his gaze glued to a stock image photo of a group of smiling children. “I dunno,” he mumbled, chewing on his pencil. “Maybe he wants us to get jobs?”

The sheriff was quick to shush us. “How many of you want to be grown ups?”

Every hand shot up, and the proud smile on his mouth twisted my gut. 

“What would you say, if I told you the group of you could become adults early?”

Isabella squeaked excitedly. “You're going to turn us into grown ups? That's so cool!”

“Well, it’s a little more complicated than that, but, uhhh, yes, I suppose, if you put it that way! Introducing The Cut! At the age of fifteen, you’ll lie down on a warm, comfortable table, and in the time it takes to blink—just a single blink—you’ll be twenty-five.""

""No pain, or mess, no confusion. Just a smooth transition into adulthood. You won’t remember the procedure itself."" 

""You’ll close your eyes as a child, and in a single blink of your eye, you will be twenty five years old. No awkward years, and no need for higher education. Everything unnecessary—everything that gets in the way of your development, will be removed.”

He chuckled. “And the best part? You’ll wake up ready. Ready to enter the great American workforce! Isn't that wonderful?”

Casper leaned forward, after a bout of silence. 

I was pretty sure Isabella had burst into uncontrollable sobs. 

“You're a genius,” Casper whispered excitedly, his mouth breaking into a grin. His eyes were eerily glued to the presentation, half lidded, like he was hypnotised by the current slide.

“I *love* it.”

“What?” Zach’s eyes were wide. He was terrified. “Did you not hear what he said?”

Looking around the class, most of my classmates had the same sentiment. 

I'm pretty sure one boy started having a panic attack. 

Casper, however, was for once sitting up straight in his chair, eagerly waiting for the presentation to continue. I remember my stomach was churning, vomit creeping up my throat in a sour slime. “You're serious?” I whispered, twisting in my chair to him. 

Casper had this look on his face— an expression I'll never forget. 

Like he was relieved that all the troubles in his mind, his insecurities and fears of not being good enough, were being lifted from his shoulders. 

Casper was the smart kid, the boy who wouldn't stop talking about higher education, and high school. And yet somehow, all of his ambitions and dreams had been wiped out in one single speech. 

He was fascinated, and I found myself terrified by the glimmer in his eyes, the light from the board reflecting in his pupils. 

The boy shrugged, smiling. 

“What?” His grin eerily mimicked the sheriff’s. “I want to be a grown up.”

Unsurprisingly, the rest of us thought this man was fucking insane. 

When he left the room, my classmates erupted into protests. 

When I stepped inside our house, my mom was actually home. 

She was in the kitchen, shouting on the phone—and in her hands was a flyer detailing The Future Work Initiative. 

I was curious, so I read through it. The flyer itself was slick in my clammy hands, smelling of bleach, my nails scratching across each page. 

I only had to get to section three (Uniformity, and Keeping Our Children Safe)—an entire section on the specialized colors we would be wearing—to know this thing was actually happening. The bill had passed earlier that morning. Somehow, I kept reading, feeling progressively sicker. 

When I reached The New Parent initiative (Making Sure Our Children Are Fully Protected by Parents Following the Initiative), I ran upstairs to my room and buried my head in my pillows.

I kept reading, hiding under my blankets, my stomach contorting, bile filling my mouth. 

Section 4: Cutting Your Child (Explained):

“As a parent, we empathise that you are worried for your children's future. We understand, while the Cutting process does sound intimidating, it is simply a medical procedure that will protect your child going forward, and ensure they live long, prosperous lives (and, of course, provide you with the next generation)!

The Cutting process is a quick and easy fix which will take exactly 45 minutes

Using precise neurological and physiological intervention, we extract the child self, allowing the adult form to emerge fully developed. 

For your son/daughter, they will not feel time passing, and will  seamlessly transition into adulthood. 

Please be aware, this will not affect your child's neurological development. Once completed, your child will be *turned off*. This is completely normal, and we ask you to please be patient with your child. For more details on what to expect post-Cutting, please refer to **Section 5: Aftercare and Integration.**

Before I could flip over, the flyer was snatched out of my hands.

Mom loomed over me, phone pressed to her ear, her eyes raw from crying. 

She didn't speak to me, instead placing a plate of cookies on my bedside table and kissing my forehead. Mom took the flyer, tore it into two, and dumped it in my trash can.

“Pack a suitcase, just in case,” she told me, before leaving my room. “Only the necessities.”

I understood it was a parent’s job to keep their children safe, but I already knew what was going on—and Mom’s attempts to shield me from the truth only made me feel useless. Mom spent the next several weeks campaigning and protesting for my rights, for my classmates’ rights to an education. I insisted on accompanying her, protesting for my own rights, joining my friends and their parents outside the mayor’s office. Mom took me out of school in protest, homeschooling me instead.

I never expected things to actually go forward.

I was a kid. I stood next to my mother and waved my sign, and in the back of my head, I thought, This won't really happen, right? It's just a misunderstanding, and we’ll all go back to school, and this will all be forgotten. 

But one day, Mom came home from the store crying. 

She didn't say why, but I overheard her on the phone speaking to Grammy. 

“It's every *fucking* store,” she whispered. “They're not letting me buy anything, and they're refusing my card. I need to be part of this fucking new parents initiative, if I want gas or food.” 

She sighed, running her fingers along the countertop. “Yes, I'm going to try to skip town. There's a Walmart in the next one over. Okay, yes, I promise. It's okay, I've got our passports.”

I'm not sure how to tell you exactly how my town fell in just a couple of weeks. 

People started throwing rocks at our windows. 

I saw Zach with his mother. Zach was wearing the new mandatory color for us. 

Purple. 

Purple shirt and purple pants for boys. 

Purple dress and purple tights, for girls. 

I only had to see the strain in his face, the way he kept tugging at his mother’s hand, for me to know he *hated* his new clothes. 

I was homeschooled, so I saw everything. 

I wish I didn't. I think part of me wishes I actually went to school, so I didn't witness my life crumbling around me. 

I saw the men in black force their way into our house, restraining my screaming mother, taking her purse, passport, and my birth certificate. 

They also took her phone, laptop, and all of my books from my shelf. 

As part of The Future Work Initiative, I would only be reading town-mandated books. 

I was torn from my mother’s arms two days later, and taken to what used to be the county jail. Instead of holding criminals, it held terrified ten year olds. 

I was thrown into a cell with four other kids. 

We were told, from that moment on, our parents were no longer our parents– and we would be adopted by parents in The New Parent Initiative. Some kids violently fought back, and were dragged away. 

I was left with a girl called Ciara, who slumped next to me. I remember the feeling of her fingers wrapped around mine. In the dim glow of an overhead bulb, she broke out into sobs that I knew lied. 

I saw her expression that day during her presentation. 

She was smiling too. Just like Casper. 

“Well, at least we’ll get jobs,” she murmured, resting her head on my shoulder. “I can't wait to get a job, Mattie.”

I fell asleep, shivering, curled up with Ciara. 

But as quickly as I slipped into slumber, I awoke to a flashlight blinding me. 

My first instinct was to scream, but then I saw the face behind the light. Mom. 

“Get up, honey.” She gently pulled me to my feet, wrapping her arms around me. 

I didn't realize I was crying, until my body was trembling, my arms squeezed around my mother. She smelled like daffodils and her favorite perfume. 

Mom pulled away, pressing a finger to her lips. “We’re going to stay with Grammy, all right?” she whispered. 

Mom gestured for Ciara to follow, but the girl shuffled back, shaking her head of blonde curls. Ciara curled into herself, wrapping her arms around her knees. 

“My Mom is a traitor to the town,” she whispered. Her eyes were vacant. Hollow. Her smile unwavered, fingers gripping the material of her dress. 

“Mom *thinks* she knows what is best for me— but I *want* to be a part of The Future Work Initiative.” 

Mom’s eyes darkened, but she stepped back. “Ciara, honey, I want you to come with me and I promise I will keep you safe.”

Ciara lifted her head, settling us with a smile. “If you try to take me away, I will start screaming.”

Mom wanted to save Ciara, but I told her not to bother. 

The girl would take pleasure in me being captured. 

Mom easily dragged me out of the sheriff’s station, and to my surprise, half a dozen other kids boarded a stolen school bus on the edge of the sidewalk. I didn't ask *how* she had saved them, promptly ignoring the body of a man slumped on the sidewalk. 

“He's unconscious,” Mom said quickly, pulling me onto the bus. 

I wondered where all of the other guards were. 

“Daniel?” Mom was speaking into a phone, sliding into the driver's seat. “Yeah, I've got fifteen of them, including my daughter. Yeah, I just need passports for fifteen kids.”

Mom paused, forcing the keys into the ignition. 

“Mom?” I pressed my face against the glass of the window, my gaze glued to the man on the sidewalk. “Is that man dead?”

“Sit down, Mattie.” was all she said, stamping on the gas. 

Mom’s plan to help us escape on a school bus was equal parts genius and stupid. 

I mean, a random woman driving a school bus full of fourth graders in the middle of the night? 

Definitely suspicious. 

I stayed as still as possible at the back of the bus, knees tucked to my chest, arms wrapped around my backpack. 

There were fifteen of us, but all I really saw were familiar faces in a sea of purple. The ones Mom saved. 

Cassie was crying, her face buried in her lap. Kaian was trying to comfort her, but he wasn’t doing a very good job. 

Zach was still standing, his fingers wrapped tightly around a yellow pole as the bus swayed with every turn. 

I noticed his mandatory purple shirt under a jacket hanging off of him. His eyes were wide, his teeth gritted. 

“Are we *there* yet?” he asked, his voice flying up in octaves when she slammed on the brakes, almost sending him flying. Mom didn’t even look back, hands glued to the wheel. 

When Zach asked again, she used her warning voice.

“Sit *down*, Zach.”

“How do we even know we can trust you?” he demanded. He twisted to me, his eyes accusing. “Mattie’s mom could be leading us right into a trap—and back to our parents.”

“Zach, you know that's not true,” my mom said softly. “I know you're all scared,  but I'm going to take you somewhere safe.”

“Where?” Zach snapped. “Are you taking us to be chopped up?”

“Somewhere *safe*.” 

“Okay, but *where*?” he wailed, his voice breaking. 

“Canada.”

“Canada?!” he squeaked, almost toppling over. 

“Zach.” Mom’s tone hardened. “I am losing my patience with you. Please sit *down*.”

He didn’t sit, staying stubbornly upright, letting the bus swing him back and forth. 

I caught his gaze following each house we passed, his bottom lip wobbling. 

“If I'm sitting down, I can't run away,” he said through gritted teeth. In the normal days of our town, he was a teacher’s pet. 

Insufferable, but harmless—as long as I remembered to finish my homework.

Zach was the type of kid who announced at the end of class, “Umm, what about homework?” 

This Zach was… different.

I wasn't sure I liked this version of him. 

I noticed we were passing his parents' house, and he ducked immediately, pressing his hand over his mouth. 

I watched the teacher’s pet crumble, coming apart as we flew past the familiar bright red of his mother’s front door. 

I was too scared to unravel my own body, my knees so tightly pressed to my chest, I thought I was going to suffocate. 

“Zach.” Mom’s voice was like warm water coming over me. “Talk to me, honey,” she spoke softly, coaxing Zach into his seat.

He slumped down with a sob, half off of the seat, already ready to run if needed. 

“I *hate* her,” he whispered into his knees, his hands balled into fists. 

“Zach, you know your mother loves you—” Mom started to say, before he let out a scream, slamming his fists against the window. 

""Shut up,"" he spat at my mom through a sob. ""You... you don't know what you're talking about! Mom made me wear this stupid shirt,"" he said, tugging at the material, his lips curling in disgust. ""And she's going to let them cut me up into little pieces!""

“It's not cutting us up into little pieces, moron,” Kaian grumbled. “It's just our brain.”

“No, that's *wrong*,” Cassie whispered. “I read the flyer. They're going to cut us up.”

“Then how will we be able to *work*?” Kaian shot back, tugging at his blonde curls. “If they cut us up into like, tiny little pieces, there won't be anything left of us.”

I thought Mom was going to say something reassuring, that Zach’s mother was just scared. 

But then I saw my mother’s fingers tighten around the wheel, her lip curling in disgust. “You're right,” she said softly. 

“Zach, your mother is brainwashed.” Mom twisted around to shoot him a small smile. 

“But I'm going to take you far away from her, all right? You're not going to be scared again. That goes for *all* of you,” my mother spoke up. “I'm going to keep you all safe.”

I want to tell you that my rights ended in a series of events. 

I want to tell you that we were caught, and my mother was dragged away, screaming. 

But the reality is, my rights ended with a BANG. 

I thought it was a blown tire, or maybe we had run over a cat. But then the screams slammed into me—agonizing wails that wouldn’t leave my head. I was only aware of my mother’s body sitting rigid, and the splintered glass of the bus’s windscreen.

When men and women in black filed onto the bus, yanking us from our seats, I was paralyzed at the back, watching the slow dripping red slide down the windscreen. 

Mom. 

I remember diving forwards. I remember screaming for her. 

But already, I was in a stranger’s arms who smelled like shoe polish and grease. I was carried off of the bus, screaming, and when I looked back, my mom wasn't moving. 

One of the soldiers kicked the heel of his boot into her head, and she slid off of the seat, unmoving, almost like trickling water. 

The thing about grieving is, I learned it was  a long process. 

It was a drawn out process. 

When my grandpappy died, I didn't feel the pain instantly. It was more like a sinking feeling that never really went away.  

But with Mom, I wasn't allowed to grieve. I didn't have *time* to grieve. 

By the time I was fully registering my mother was dead, I was dressed in a purple dress that stuck to my skin, and felt like fire ants, standing outside my new parents front door– a tall man wearing a mask held my hand, and no matter how many times I tugged away, he held tighter. 

Zach was standing behind me, his eyes unseeing. 

He kept nudging me. 

“What are we going to do?”

“Mattie, what do we do now?”

“Mattie, please! Tell me what we are going to do!”

I didn't respond. I was thinking about my mother’s brains dripping down the bus window. 

When the door opened, our new mother welcomed us with open arms. 

She was a big woman with curly hair, and a wide smile. 

“Matilda!” she wrapped her arms around me, pulling Zach into the embrace. 

“Oh, and you must be Zach! Hello, darlings! I’m so happy to be adding to our little family! Wait until you meet your brother!”

Zach wriggled out of her arms, tossing me a look. 

*“Brother?”*

Introducing herself as Mrs H, she led us into a brightly lit kitchen, where a familiar face sat, his head of brown curls buried in a brand new edition of The Future Work Initiative– this time, a kid-friendly booklet. 

Casper. 

Behind me, I could sense Zach stiffening up.

Casper regarded us with a smile, peeking over the booklet. 

“Hello, fellow *siblings*,” he said, his grin widening when Zach mumbled a curse under his breath. “I'm glad you're finally joining me on this exciting journey to The Future Work Initiative!”

He turned the booklet around so we could read a simplified version of the Cutting procedure, and his eyes, wide with excitement, were reveling in every word. 

“Trust me, you're going to *love* it here.”

I was still numb. Still not fully understanding my surroundings. 

What I did know was that Mrs. H’s kitchen smelled like stew—and the bowl of stew in front of my classmate was there one minute, and then it was being dumped on Casper's head.

Casper didn't move, a slew of gravy and potatoes dripping down his face. 

“That's what The Future Work Initiative helps with, Zach,” he spoke calmly, prodding the booklet, reciting every word. 

“It removes *violent* tenancies, which you *clearly* have.” Leaning back in his chair, he settled us with a smirk. “It's not *my* fault you're ‘expressing violent behavior’.”

Zach definitely proved he had ‘violent behavior’ that night.

We were sent to our rooms with no dessert. 

I checked the windows in my room. All locked. 

From that day, I was forced into The Future Work Initiative. 

School was no longer a thing. Instead of learning, we went to church every day. 

Followed by afternoon cherry picking, helping town elders. 

Mrs H assigned me and my brothers to a farm on the edge of town– and admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it. I got to look after the animals, pick and grow fruit, and learn how to work the machinery with the farmers. 

I think part of me was hyper fixating on anything that wasn't thinking about my mother.

When I finished my farm work one night, Zach pulled me into the cornfield, where, to my surprise, he'd fashioned a grave for my mother. 

I didn't thank him. I accepted the rose he picked out for me, lay it down on the ground, and broke apart in his arms. 

When I turned thirteen, Mrs H surprised me with mandatory classes after dinner.

Classes weren't allowed. 

According to the new rule, educating children in any way was a criminal offense.

So, when Mrs H broke out hidden workbooks, piling them in front of us, I realized she was actively educating us. 

Casper wasn't a fan. Obviously. But he had missed actually doing *work*. 

He threatened to tell the authorities, until Zach *”threatened* to break his legs. 

So, after dinner, every day, the three of us had five hours of school in the basement. 

Casper refused to join in at first, hiding behind The Future Work Initiative books. 

But, slowly, he started to shift towards us, at first silently watching me complete a test (and trying, multiple times) to correct me. 

“You're doing it *wrong*,” Casper grumbled, sitting with his knees to his chest. 

I ignored him, but I could feel his eyes burning holes into my exam paper. 

“Question 3 is simple, and you're *supposed* to show your working.”

He was right. 

I started to scribble my working, and he let out an exaggerated sigh. 

“Mattie, you're *killing* me.”

Zach, embedded in his own workbook, finally slammed it down in frustration. 

He didn't speak, snatching up a blank workbook, scribbling Casper's name on the front, and throwing at the boy’s head. 

“Harsh.” Casper mumbled. But he did open the workbook, grabbing a pen. 

His eyes flicked to me, lips curling. “Just so you know, I'm only doing this because you two are too stupid to do it on your own.”

Casper started joining us for every lesson, afterwards. 

He started doing his own tests, and even requesting more books for him to read. 

Growing into a teenager, I started to realize my procedure wasn't far away. 

I was thirteen years old, still working the fields, picking fruit, and attending church to “pray for forgiveness’. 

Apparently, being semi educated at the age of twelve was ‘bad’. 

We had to learn ‘REAL’ American values. Our priest had been replaced with a man in a black mask. 

I was getting ready for my SAT’s in secret. Mrs H had managed to get her hands on old papers from years before, but it was enough. 

Zach questioned her, halfway through a  pop quiz. 

“What's the point?” he said, his pen lodged between his teeth. Zach was boyishly handsome, hiding under thick brown curls.

He was also seriously crushing on the guy who delivered our town-mandated newspapers. “Why are you helping us with our SAT’s if we’re not going to college?”

“I second that.” I spoke up, looking up from my work. “You're working *with* them.”

Mrs H sighed, before kneeling on the ground. 

“I tell you this once, and only once,” she said softly. “Yes, I may very well agree with The Future Work Initiative. But I also stand for children getting a proper education.”

Her eyes flicked to me. “Make no mistake, Matilda. I *will* be delivering you to the Cutting bay. But first, you will be  correctly educated, so you can enter the world as fully functioning intelligent adults.”

“But what if we don't *want* to?” Zach spoke with gritted teeth. 

I nudged him to shut up, but he was already straightening up. 

“Mrs H, you've been teaching me since I was a kid, and I appreciate that,” he whispered. “I wouldn't know what the fuck I was doing if you didn't let me continue school.”

“Language, Zach.”

“Sorry.” he rolled his eyes. “You just said you believe in our rights to be educated, but you're happy sending us to be cut up?”

Mrs H didn't speak. Even Casper was silent, gaze glued to his workbook. 

Casper had changed over the years. I think he'd regained his love for learning. 

(and being a pretentious, know-it-all little shit). 

There was an ominous silence, before he coughed awkwardly. 

“I believe in The Future Work Initiative,” Casper said softly, dragging his pen across the floor. He was cross legged, a book on his lap. “But… I think it should be a choice.”

Casper rolled his eyes when Zach balked at him. 

“Maybe.”

Mrs H startled us by slamming her own book on the floor. 

“That's *enough,*” she said. But her expression was eerily familiar to my forty grade teacher before she abandoned us. She looked hopeless. Scared. Confused. 

Mrs H’s tone darkened. “If you speak another *word*, you can forget dessert.”

We did shut up, but already, I think our new mother was having her own doubts. 

Still. Zach and I made plans to run. Casper hung around us. 

“I'm *not* coming with you.” he kept insisting, but he never left our side. 

On the day of The Cut, we would attend church, go back to the house, and be escorted by our mother to the Cutting bay. 

Our plan was to sneak out of church, and make a run for it. 

On the day I would be Cut, I stuffed my face with pancakes.

I was fifteen years old. I was supposed to be going to school. 

I was *supposed*  to have an idea of what I wanted to do with my life. 

“Morning.” Zach said, sipping coffee. His prolonged gaze meant he was still ready to run. 

I gave him a simple jerk of my head, twisting around and pouring my cereal. 

“You two are painfully obvious,” Casper grumbled from behind an *actual* book. 

“But you're coming.” Zach breathed to him in passing, going straight for the cookies. 

Casper didn't look up from his book. “Of course I'm *coming*.”

Mrs H greeted us at breakfast, before dropping the bombshell. 

“There will be a car waiting for you outside in five minutes,” she said stiffly, tears filling her eyes. “I want you, with zero questions, to get in the back, and do not look back.”

I didn't know what to say. I hugged her. I cried. 

Zach and I embraced our mother, and at that moment I really did think we were a family. 

Casper stood with a curled lip, for maybe 0.1 seconds, before joining in. 

Mrs H told us to pack a bag. There were no hugs goodbye, no tearful thank yous, though I did promise to contact her once we were out of town. 

She guarded the door, and when we were ready, ushered us out, down the lawn, and straight into the back of a sleek range rover. I jumped in, followed by Zach, and finally, Casper, squeezing himself between the two of us. 

We were free. 

I only let out a sigh of relief when we were far away from Mrs H's house. 

“You kids all right?” the driver, a youngish looking man, spoke up after a long silence. 

I didn't respond. 

Next to me, Zach was shaking, his hands clasped in his lap. 

""We're fine,"" Casper said after nudging me to respond. ""It's nothing a little therapy—for, I don't know, the rest of our fucking lives—won't fix.""

The driver laughed heartily. “Good! Do you kids mind if I play a little music?”

He stabbed the radio on, regardless of our response. 

I liked the song. I don't know it, but the lyrics stuck with me as I crumpled into rich leather seats, letting my head tip back, my eyes flickering shut, reveling in the music. 

Tell me lies, 

Tell me sweet little lies

Something, something, I'm not making plans. 

I didn't realize I was dozing off, until Casper nudged me. 

Hard. 

“Hey.” he whispered, and my eyes shot open. “Mattie. Something is wrong.”

Next to me, Zach’s head had found my shoulder. 

But in front of me, something was thick and foggy. 

I think I laughed, tipping my head back. I felt a panic surge, but my body was already numb. 

Mrs H already knew we were going to escape. 

So, in the most gentle, and yet horrific way possible, she was delivering on her earlier words. 

What a fucking *bitch*. 

I don't remember how I got from a car to being strapped down to a hospital bed. There was a bright, clinical light above me. 

A tube stuck down my throat. 

“Mattie? Sweetie, do we have your consent to begin the procedure?”

The voice came from the figure looming over me. 

I told her, “No.” and she responded with: “Great! Count down from twenty, Mattie!”

Where were my brothers? I felt my body jerk violently under harsh velcro straps. 

“Count for me, sweetheart,” the nurse hummed in my ear. 

I did. 

I mean, I tried. 

Outside, I could hear thudding footsteps, loud wails. 

“Let me *go*!” 

I couldn't grasp the voice; my mind was already unraveling. 

“Fucking *assholes*! Let me go!”

I was partially aware of clinical white gloves hovering over me. 

I counted backwards from 20.

I can only describe it as a flash, like a photo being taken.

I blinked once, and those sterile white gloves were covered in blood.

I blinked twice, and I was screeching into the tube forced down my throat.

Three times.

""Matilda?""

Slumped in front of me, spread out on a leather chair, was my boss.

Tall, oldish, wearing an odd smile.

I was sitting, one leg crossed over the other, in a large office. A perfectly pressed dress, my hair pinned into a ponytail. It really was a blink of an eye. I was an adult. 

I didn't even feel time passing.

I was twenty-five years old, and I *felt* twenty-five years old.

""Matilda, is there a problem?"" My boss jerked my attention back to him.

""No,"" I said, my voice was deeper. ""No, there's no… problem.""

It looked like we were in the middle of a conversation. I stood, holding my hand out for him to shake. His hand was clammy. 

Slimy. 

""I'm looking forward to working with you, sir.""

""As we are with you!"" He grinned. ""Matilda, as you know, you are very well known here, and all across town! We are very excited for you to be joining us!""

He was right.

Everyone LOVED me.

Well, they loved her.

I had a high-salary office job. But I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.

I got a standing ovation when I entered the office.

But I was increasingly getting strange looks.

Initially, I thought I had something on my face.

Colleagues would just stare at me with unnerving smiles that turned my stomach.

""Be honest,"" one of my older colleagues hissed, leaning over my desk. ""How much do you *remember*?""

Her words sent my stomach into my throat.

I excused myself, running to the bathroom. Her words were like bile filling my mouth.

But I didn’t puke. I couldn't puke.

I went to grab coffee and slammed directly into another colleague.

I only saw his crisp white shirt and tie, a blazer hung over the top.

Then I saw his name tag.

""Watch where you're going,"" the man grumbled, shoving his way past me.

It sounded like he had something in his mouth.

Instinctively, I grabbed his arm, yanking him back. He choked something up, bending over and spitting it on the floor.

The sight sent me into fight or flight.

On the ground at our feet was a single strip of raw bacon.

Before I could question it, the man scooped it up and dropped it into his mouth, vacant eyes briefly finding mine.

""Matilda,"" he said through a mouthful. ""Nice to see you again.""

He started toward me suddenly, hesitantly, leaning close, his breath tickling my cheek.

I was expecting him to speak, maybe tell me he missed me.

But instead, he buried his face in my hair, sniffling deeply. I immediately retracted, but I couldn't ignore the sudden twitch in my bones, signaling that he was a threat.

The man didn't stop, and I let him. 

I think part of me enjoyed the way he ran his nose down my neck, inhaling every part of me, until his lips found mine—first with hesitance, his entire body jolting back, before his expression began to soften.

I knew them. I knew his slick red lips, razor-sharp teeth scathing the back of my neck.

His heavy pants as he chased me, cupping his mouth, screeching animal calls.

I knew his vacant eyes, his animalistic chitters.

The leader of the pack. 

The force of the memory slamming into me almost sent me crumbling to my knees.

I wasn't in the office anymore.

*I was… running.*

*The ground was uneven beneath my feet. I staggered over grass up to my knees, dropping into a crawl, forcing my way through the dirt. Above me, through a thick canopy of trees, the sun was already setting. Lunging into a sprint, branches smacked into my face, my mouth full of rust. Everything hurt.*

""Matilda?” my boss’s voice danced in the back of my skull.

But all I could feel was pain.

Pain that sent me to my knees, grasping my hair and pulling it from my scalp.

*This time, I was laughing, sprinting through trees after a retreating figure.*

*I lunged, hitting water, throwing myself onto them. Cheers thundered in my ears.*

*Slicing her throat easily, I severed her head, giggling manically to myself.*

*“Matilda has done it again!” a voice screamed. “If she beats our King, you have yourself a Queen!”*

*Meat.*

*The word suffocated my throat.*

*I stripped the girl’s flesh, fashioning her skull into a crown I balanced on my head*. 

*Meat.*

*Stuffing her entrails into my mouth, I faced my audience, my… adoring fans.*

*They were ants.*

*Ants I wanted to squash, and pick apart, and pull their wriggling guts from their bodies*. 

*Ants*. 

“Matilda?!”

Blinking rapidly, I was back in the office.

My boss stood in front of me, waving his hand in my face.

Behind me, Casper's eyes were glued to me. He pulled a stringy piece of chicken from his teeth, dangling it teasingly, his smile growing, revealing spiky incisors.

“Are you okay?” my boss asked, wide-eyed.

I didn't realize I’d dropped my coffee mug, slicing my finger on the shattered pieces. 

“Yeah.”

Sticking my bloody finger in my mouth, pleasure exploded in my throat, hunger slamming into me. I could sense my smile growing wider, stretching across my face. 

*Ants*. 

“I’m…great!”

...

My boss invited me to speak to him at lunch.

I knocked on his office door. His response was a gruff laugh.

“I *know* you are awake,” he snapped when I stepped inside. 

I blinked. 

“I'm sorry sir, I… don't know what you're talking about.”

He rolled his eyes. “Oh, give it up, the other kid tried to hide it too. It’s exhausting. I can quite literally *see* the cognitive awareness in your eyes. It's actually quite disappointing your juvenile consciousness has caught up.""

His lip curled. “Matilda, I was hoping your ‘cut’ would last longer. You are an exceptional worker.”

He activated a screen projected across the wall. 

On it, Zach. Covered in blood.

His eyes were wild and vacant, penetrating the camera. 

The screen flickered off.

""Now, how were we supposed to know that removing vital parts of your brain would cause these kinds of side effects? It was fascinating. Truly fascinating! Children turned animals."" 

He grinned. ""Now *look* at you."" He nodded to the door. 

""The other kid, too. Perfectly reformed, and, ironically, exactly what you were supposed to be in the first place! Now, isn't that wonderful , hmm? Happy endings all around! Now, Matilda, you can either go back to your job, or…” 

He turned to the screen displaying my brother. “Back to the playpen!""

My response was quick and clinical, wearing a smile. 

“Work, of course.” I said. “I work for The Future Work Initiative.”

I grabbed his hand, shaking it. His heart was pounding.

He was scared of me. Disgusted, yes, but *terrified*.

I had only one thought.

*Find Zach*.

“I’d *really* like to work here, sir.” I gushed. “As part of The Future Work Initiative.”

He let go like I was diseased. 

“Jeez. They really did a number on you kids, huh?”  he jerked his head toward the door.  “Get the fuck out of my office.”

In three strides, I did.

Walking directly into a grinning Casper.

“Mattie.”

His grotesque smile revealed raw bacon fat caught between his teeth.

He stepped towards me, his scent already overpowering. 

""You know what they are,"" Casper said, closing in on me. ""You know what they did to us! to *Zach*."" 

His voice broke, but I didn't believe it. ""What they made us do, and what they turned us into."" His expression was so far gone—inhuman, unblinking, lips breaking into an animalistic grin—I couldn't call him the boy I grew up with. 

“I want you to fucking *say* it, Mattie.”

I didn't say it. I pushed past him, and I kept walking. 

Towards an elevator with no buttons. Only one way. 

Up. 

Casper joined me. Arms folded. Still grinning like he knew something I didn't. 

Back to work. 

For The Future Work Initiative.

I’m interested in getting into coffee. I’ve been binging YouTube (James Hoffman and others) and have tried a few supposedly good local places (Herkimer, Zoka). I currently use a cheap blade grinder and a cheap stainless steel filterless pour over cone. I like the Zoka beans better so far with the ones I tried anyway because I tend to be like the masses maybe? and like not fruity coffee as far as I know but don’t really even know. I tried a macchiato from Herkimer and it tasted incredibly salty to me. The beans I bought and used with my cheap set up seemed too sour for me but my method is very novice. I’m interested in trying lots of beans, and methods/equipment without actually investing in it yet because I don’t really know what I like. 

I’d like the sample type experience vs slowly trying things on the menu because I don’t buy coffee out very often ($$ and don’t get out much in general) so it would take me literally months or years to even try enough to compare. 

If this doesn’t exist, how do you go about finding what you like without collecting tons of set ups/beans and spending boat loads of money?

Welcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober.

I once heard someone say ""I haven't had to check my bumper the next morning"" and that resonated with me.

Towards the end of my drinking, I mostly just stayed home and blacked out.  But I like this quote because it reminded me of all the times I woke up in the morning and had to piece together what happened the night before.  Did I say something to the wife?  Were we still in the middle of a fight?  What show might we have watched?  What was I supposed to remember?

In sobriety, I just don't have to deal with those shameful, disorienting mornings after.  Instead I wake up, get the kids up, let the dogs out, and make a cup of coffee for myself and my wife.  It's quite an improvement.

So how about you?  What kinds of ""bumpers"" did you have to check when you were drinking and what do you do with yourself in the mornings now?",1,1763440805.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

*Written by Brent Antonson*  
*For the ones who keep the smoke trailing the right way.*

**INT. APARTMENT – DAY**

A kettle boils. Cigarette smoke curls upward.

**MAE**, late 30s, glasses perched low, clipboard in hand, watches two actors rehearsing a scene. Her eyes dart between the props, the lighting, the hands.

She taps her pen against a marked-up **CONTINUITY LOG**.

                            MAE  
              (muttering)
              Wrong hand. Again.
    

She circles something. A **PHOTO ON THE WALL** in the background… has moved.

**INT. SET HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER**

Mae walks with purpose. A production assistant nearly bumps her.

                            PA  
              Sorry, Miss Adler!
    
                            MAE  
              Don't be sorry. Be symmetrical.
    

She moves on. The assistant is baffled.

**INT. VIDEO VILLAGE – CONTINUOUS**

Mae rewinds footage on a monitor.

                            MAE  
              (to herself)
              Coffee mug, handle left. Then right. Then gone.
    

Her eyes widen. Something else is off. The **clock** in the shot—**ticking backward**.

She scribbles: “Reel 6 → continuity anomaly → possible mirror.”

**EXT. PARK SET – SUNSET SHOOT**

An actor lights a cigarette. He fumbles.

                            MAE  
              Cut!
    

She rushes in.

                            MAE (CONT’D)  
              You lit that cig in Scene 18. It’s burned down to half by now.
    
                            ACTOR  
              It’s not a real smoke.
    
                            MAE  
              (pointing at the sky)
              Neither is that sunset, but here we are.
    

**INT. MAE’S TRAILER – NIGHT**

She pins continuity stills to a corkboard. Something is wrong.

She layers them. The sequence doesn’t add up.

                            MAE  
              The movie’s folding in on itself.
    

Zoom in: The **first frame** matches the **last frame**.

                            MAE (CONT’D)  
              We’ve been filming backwards.
    

Thunder.

**INT. SOUNDSTAGE – DREAMLIKE**

Mae stands alone. The set is now surreal — props floating slightly off the ground, lighting rigs flickering.

                            MAE  
              For the sake of continuity...
    

She removes her glasses.

                            MAE (CONT’D)  
              I am going to wake up now.
    

**INT. SAME APARTMENT – DAY**

Kettle boils. Cigarette curls. Mae blinks.

Everything is… identical. But her logbook is blank.

A pen rolls toward her. She lifts it.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**FOR THE ONES WHO WATCH CLOSEST.**

Tapos he keeps telling me na minsan lang naman daw, but again I said no. 

Normal lang naman na humindi ako diba? I feel like nag kikita nalang kami para isatisfy yung isa't isa. I don't want to be in that kind of relationship, but I love him. Can you guys give me some advice? Don't judge hell, I'm asking genuinely.",0,1763440367.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False
1p02mwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p02mwf/aitah_for_committing_to_a_job_that_turned_out_to/,AITAH for committing to a job that turned out to be the opposite of what I thought it was and wanting to back out?,"Throwaway account because story is so specific it will be recognized by those who know me. It’s a long one but I really need advice. 

For context I am a 18yr female. 

I was living in my parents home with no intention of moving, and did house sitting (watching peoples homes and pets while they were on vacation) and mechanics for work. 

I have been house sitting since I was 12 so I am very used to being away from home for prolonged periods of time. 

Anyways one of our close family friends proposed a job for me in which I completely move out and live on their property full time, managing a farm. Basically I man the farm, and it pays my rent. I was aware I wouldn’t get paid for it, but was also told it was 1-2 hours of work a day and I could come and go as I wished.

Car was provided with the house, which I come to find out has terrible transmission issues I don’t feel I should be responsible for fixing as I have no income. 

It sounded like a sweet deal. I sat on it for six months, waiting for the last employee they had to move out as she hadn’t been trust worthy, thus them wanting me as her replacement. I had a terrible gut feeling about taking the job, and spent many nights sobbing into my boyfriends chest while he slept knowing that I was going to be so far when I was used to living five minutes away from everyone I loved. The distance terrified me. Last year I house sat two hours away for a month, and I nearly lost my mind in the isolation. But my parents and boyfriend encouraged me to take this job despite the intimidation I felt, saying I’d regret it if I didn’t. 

I like to think putting yourself in uncomfortable positions is how you grow. So I took the job. Under the impression it was a couple hours a day, and I’d make a commission off of the goods I’d sell from the farm. 

Listen, the house is big, it’s a 3 bedroom 3 bathroom house, on 200 acres of beautiful land. However it was completely unfurnished. Keep in mind I am 18, I had saved over the last couple of years and furnishing the house costed me nearly 8 grand. Cheap because I bought a lot of stuff from thrifting/garage sales and my boyfriend’s family is moving so they gave me a bunch of furniture, and other friends donated things as well. 
Again, car provided, rent paid. All I had to do was work. 

I have been here for almost 3 months. It is an hour away from home and I spent so much of my savings buying furniture and making the place full, that i literally don’t have money for groceries anymore never mind capability’s to get to the city in this car that is scary to drive. So I am isolated. 
Now the real catcher is that when I came out, the people who own the farm told me to let them know if they were being unreasonable. Said they’d give me $50 a week for groceries and whatever else I needed. So $200 a month. And free rent, which seemed totally reasonable at the time. I figured I’d have enough time to get a second job out here or do mechanics on the side. 

It was fun at first and what I expected. But I think I’m past the honeymoon phase. 
Stick with me please I know this is long!
It is not two hours a day. It is upwards of 8 some days, and there has been days where there was so much to get done in the barn that I woke up at 7am, and was in the barn from the second I finished my coffee until 9pm. Some days feel so long I can’t even find time to eat and I am the type of person who can’t rest unless all the work is done. But the work piles up so fast I never sleep anymore. Maybe 4 hours a night when I’m used to 8. The owners come to help some days. Which is totally awesome, but it’s still a massive workload on me.

I’ve completely lost time for myself. I don’t read anymore, I don’t like cooking (my favourite hobby) because I don’t have time to do the dishes. Some days I am so stressed out I can’t even shower, and there’s been days that waking up and facing what my life looks like has me in tears. I’ve spent nights on the bathroom floor scream crying. I am 18 and have never been so mentally exhausted in my life. I’ve worked harder than this. But the difference is I was being paid and money is a motivator. 

I agreed to this job so it seems completely unreasonable in my mind to bring it up or be upset with it because I am in control of my own mental, not the people who own the farm. And I moved all of my stuff here, so I couldn’t get up and leave because I would have no where to put my stuff. I don’t have any money, I get stressed about buying myself a coffee at a coffee shop. I wake up with apprehension, and the only thing that keeps me going during the days is knowing I’ll get to see my boyfriend and family come weekends, when I can leave for a night and do farm work before I go, then catch up as soon as I get back. My boyfriend comes to visit often, but he’s busy and works too. So we went from seeing each other almost everyday for a year because we lived so close, to seeing each other maybe once or twice a week. It destroys me that so much is happening back at home, and I’m on a farm working myself to the point of exhaustion to pay rent for a house that doesn’t benefit me. I moved here because I love the people who own the place and I knew they needed someone reliable to watch the farm because they are getting older and it’s a lot of work for them. It seemed fun until I realized I work so much here that I don’t have time for a second job, and I think if I took a second job in the mental state I am in and tried to manage that, it would send me into a coma. I genuinely cannot handle this. Not to mention I just bought Christmas presents with my remaining money, and am not only out of money but indebted to people now too. With no way of paying them back. Because the $50 a week that was promised hasn’t been given to me in the last month. And the little commission I make off of the farm goods, isn’t even enough to cover bread and milk in this economy. I am struggling. It is harming my health, my happiness, and my relationships. I feel some days I left everything I cared about to do this job and move out. But I can’t be proud of moving out at 18 because I don’t own the place and being here is stopping me from moving forward in life. If I was working 5-8 hour days anywhere else I’d have so much saved up. I left a good job to be here for what? To say I moved out? To feel good about helping people out when it’s destroying me? I have no relationship with my siblings anymore, I barely talk to my parents cause I am so busy. And my poor angel of a boyfriend has held me in his arms while we cried together because it hurt him so bad to see me in so much pain. 

I wish I could take it back but I can’t and I am here now. I don’t have time for a second job unless I proposed a 4 days on the farm 3 days off situation or asked them for more money. But I don’t feel that’s fair because the deal was I work for the rent to be paid, and I don’t want to put them out because I’m sure if they could pay me they would. 

I’ve been tracking my hours this month. I presume the bills are cheap for the house cause it’s one person living here and I don’t use much electricity apart from heat, but it would be $1200 in winter with the heat bills. However if I was being paid the $25 an hour I was making before I took this job, and working the hours I’m working here I’d have at least $3500 a month if not more. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m looking at jobs I can do from home, or ways to make extra money on the side but i literally don’t have time for another job when I barely have time to eat or shower. 
I’m losing sleep and I feel like I’m losing my mind. This situation doesn’t benefit me or my future. But I feel like such a brat for committing to this knowing what it was and now hating it. However I didn’t expect the work load or to not make any money at all after grocery money was promised. I went two weeks without milk at one point because I couldn’t afford it and I’ve never been that broke. Maybe that’s adulthood. But it doesn’t feel fair. I feel like I’m volunteering the next 3 years of my life away, that was the time I promised. Mind you I got two cats since I’ve been here so moving back home isn’t doable because my parents wouldn’t let me take my cats.

AITAH for wanting to compromise with the owners of the farm even though they believe I’m perfectly happy and committed to this job? 

I want to have a conversation about the tole it’s taking on me, my passions, and my future, but I don’t know how without seeming ungrateful. I am very privileged I know; and if I had no home before this, it would’ve been a great opportunity. But I did have a home, a job, and a life, and I left it all to be here for them because I love them. But it’s at my expense completely. I feel like I am too young to be sacrificing these years with nothing to show for it except for bad mental health and strained relationships. Please give me advice. 

If you read this all thank you so much truly. I’m at my wits end.

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

\*\*About Me:\*\* Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

\*\*What I’m Like:\*\* Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

\*\*What I’m Looking For:\*\* I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

\*\*Dealbreakers:\*\* tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

1p02j5e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p02j5e,How would the world of EAW deal with infection AUs?,"Now as the title says how would the world of EAW deal with the different infection AUs of MLP, now the answers depends completely on which AU we are talking about, so that's why chose 3 of my favorite infection AU's as examples of how I think they would deal with them

1. My Golden Pony Friendship is shiny: In summary the infection began because of a fungal infection inside of a beauty product that takes over a Pony's mind and makes them want to spread said fungus as much as possible

2. My little Pony Friendship is Gone: Chrysalis after being exiled from her hive creates a virus that turns Ponies into flesh-eating changelings under her control in order to take over Equestria

3. The Molt Effect: Spike was going through dragon puberty and wasn't feeling ok, Twilight asked him to make her coffee, Spike while making the coffee accidentaly had one of his scales fall inside, after drinking the coffee Twilight began to feel sick before rapidly mutating into a large dragon (See picture 4). After that Twilight went on a rampage rapidly spreading the infection through out all of Equestria, of the 3 AUs this is the most apocaliptic as it required a full on universe re-start to end the outbreak  


How I think EAW would deal with each of these from least catasthrophic to world ending?

3. My Golden Pony, that whole AU would have not have happened if Celestia had funded the Equestrian FDA as they would very quickly found out this new beauty product has a brain-controlling fungus in it, so I think in EAW it would not have been even allowed in store shells, worst case scenario it reaches the consumer market before being pulled out as Equestrian Authorities begin noticing its effect, thus in the end it wouldn't cause lasting damage even in the worst case scenario

2. Friendship is Gone, ignoring the origins and just saying it's a new novel disease from Acornage I think the Royal Guard would deal with it rather quickly as the infected are driven purely by their hunger so they don't really hide, so it would be a typical zombie scenario, so a worst case scenario it'd just make going on walks in forests or rural areas extremely dangerous but more likely is contained and eradicated in Acornage, but in either case expect a lot more anti-Changeling racism and conspiracy theories

1. The Molt Effect, this one in my opinion has the most apocaliptic potential, in the AU within an hour of Twilight being infected half of Ponyville were a bunch of messed up bloodthirsty dragons hellbent on hunting down the other half, and 5 days later of all Equestria was completely overruned, and as far as we know only dragons are inmune so there's not limit to its rate of expansion as in it isn't limited to Pony dominated areas, in other words unless the Royal Guard contains the outbreak HOUR 1, you can expect central Equestria being ravaged at bare minimun and Global societal collapse at worst

Anyways I would love to hear your opinions in the comments, do you think guns will give EAW the edge to switfly deal with the mutated dragons of the molt effect? Do you think the Equestrian FDA would catch the fungus before reaching the consumer market?",7,1763439963.0,FreeEquestriaAtWar,2,0.9,False

This morning I pulled into the parking lot of my local coffee shop and when I opened the door to my car, the wind was crazy and blew it straight open. All would’ve been fine except that there was another car parked directly next to me and a woman was in the car. I looked at the damage, she had a tiny scratch and I was left with a much bigger dent in my door. I immediately looked at her and apologized but she got out of the car and started yelling at me. I continued to apologize and told her I never would’ve intentionally hit her car, the wind took the door. However, she continued to cuss at me and yell, so I eventually stopped talking and walked away from the situation. Had she been nicer or even given me a chance to apologize without cussing, I would’ve told her that I would be happy to exchange information (despite the fact that she had several scratches on the car already and there wasn’t anything there). However, I felt it best to grab my coffee, get into my car, and just remove myself from the situation. She finished cussing me out and stormed back to her car anyways. 

AITAH for doing that? Should I have given her my information anyways? If she had even let me talk I would’ve given it to her or offered, but I couldn’t even get a word in before she stormed off.

i’m not here
to rearrange your memories
like furniture in a rented room.

i’m just the guy
who left a coffee ring
on the table of your trust
and finally came back
with a damp cloth and no excuses.

II.
some nights i rewind us
like a cassette
you forgot in an old car—
all warble and hiss,
but the song still tries
to come through.

i listen to the parts
where my silence got too loud
and your questions
never got their answer,
and i don’t blame you
for changing the station.

III.
if i could mail you my ribcage
with a return address,
you’d find a crumpled note inside:

“you weren’t crazy.
it did hurt.
i did that.”

no metaphors big enough
to smuggle that truth past customs.
it just is.
i just did.
and i am sorry
without any spiritual jazz hands.

IV.
you don’t owe me forgiveness,
closure,
or even a final scene.

your boundaries
are holy ground now,
and i am learning
how to pray
by staying on my side of the fence,
watering whatever wildflowers
still grow there
instead of climbing over
for one more look at you.

V.
i used to think
love meant never letting go,
but it turns out
sometimes love
is just stopping the damage
as quickly
and completely
as you can.

to put down the hammer,
admit you swung it,
and step away
from the shards
so you don’t cut them
again
trying to pick up
what you broke.

VI.
if you ever pass
the old version of me
on some back road
in your mind,
you have my permission
to honk once,
shake your head,
and keep driving.

i’ll be somewhere
off the main highway,
learning how to be gentle
with anything that trusts me,
including myself.

and if the wind
ever carries my name
past your window again,
i hope it sounds less
like a storm warning
and more
like a small,
steady
“thank you
for what we were,
and i’m sorry
for how i left.”",3,1763439638.0,fieldnotesofbecoming,2,1.0,False
