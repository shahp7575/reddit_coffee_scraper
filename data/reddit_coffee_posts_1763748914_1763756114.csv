1p38y60,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1p38y60/i_got_my_roommate_kicked_out_for_smoking_in_a/,I got my roommate kicked out for smoking in a house with asthmatics.,"I’m 18 and living in a shared house with 5 other roommates. Everything was completely normal until this girl “Poppy,” who’s 21, moved in about a month ago. She joined last, about a week after all of us and we had some really basic agreements. Nothing strict, just “let everyone know if someone’s coming over” and “no smoking inside.” Easy stuff.

On her first day, she had someone over immediately and blasted music at midnight so loud that people two floors down could hear every word. The house was literally shaking. And that same day, she was smoking inside. In England that’s illegal indoors, and two of my roommates have really bad asthma. They could barely breathe. We told her nicely to please smoke outside, since the garden is basically right there. She agreed. Smiled. Acted sweet.


The coffee shop owner under our house even kept finding cigarette ends on the floor, and one fell on his coworker’s head from our windows. Guess who it was? Yup.

By day three she had two more people over, running between the garden and her room. We started smelling smoke again. Same thing — she’d just keep doing it no matter how many times we asked.

For the next two weeks she kept playing her music loudly every night. Jade, our roommate next to her, kept asking her to turn it down just so she could sleep. I’ll give her this, she always turned her music down for the night

Then one night she basically threw a mini party on a weekday. It started with two people, then four, then seven people squeezed into her tiny room upstairs. She was blasting her TV at 100% like always, and the whole house was vibrating. All of us hid in my room because no one wanted to deal with her at midnight.

I went upstairs to record the noise for proof and to see if they were smoking again. While I was in Jade’s room I overheard Poppy through the wall saying, “I want to beat my roommates up so bad. I’ve got two hands, I’ll use them.” She’s… a big girl, in every sense, so hearing that at night freaked me out. I ran downstairs and we locked ourselves in our rooms. They all left for the club around midnight.

We messaged the landlord privately and he immediately told her to stop the party. She did, and strangely didn’t act angry about it.

There was also a small incident with a clothes drying rack we all bought. It cost £20 and everyone pitched in except her, which was fine as she said she had her own. But about a week later she asked to use ours. Billy said no, nicely, since she didn’t pay for it. She used it anyway and then acted annoyed at us for even mentioning it.

A week after that, things got worse. She had another boy over without telling us. They came inside smelling strongly of weed and looking extremely high. More people went upstairs with them. The house is three floors and the smell didn’t reach the basement at first, but when we all went up to go to bed, it hit us hard.

Jade messaged that she couldn’t breathe because of her asthma and was going to sleep on the sofa in the basement. She put it in the group chat so no one would be freaked out if they saw her.

Not long after that, Poppy came downstairs with a friend, turning on all the lights (which nobody normally does at night) and talking so loudly I could hear them from my room. I went down quietly to check Jade was okay and fill my water bottle. They were banging around and shrieking with laughter while Jade was literally curled up on the sofa trying to sleep.

The next night, when Jade was back in her room, they overheard Poppy talking about us again on the phone. The walls are thin, so she heard everything. More threatening stuff. Just constant drama. No one in the house felt safe at this point, and all of this was happening on weekdays while people were trying to work and go to uni.

We told the landlord again. He wasn’t happy. He messaged her again. She then posted in our group chat accusing us of “snitching on her for having friends over.” She completely missed the point that it was the smoking, the weed, the noise, and the threats that were the actual issue. She even called Jade a “child” for sleeping downstairs when Jade literally couldn’t breathe in her own room.

Eventually the landlord told her she needed to find a new place. She moved out within a few days. She also took random things that weren’t hers on the way out — toilet roll, our cheese grater, just random little things.

And to top it all off, she told another roommate (who stayed out of everything) that she was leaving because we were “bullying her sister.” We met her sister once. For one minute. And all we did was compliment her hair.

Anyway… she’s gone now. The house is peaceful again. But those three weeks felt like living in a disaster zone.",1,1763755806.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

1p38m6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1p38m6m/smells_like_teen_spirit/,Smells Like Teen Spirit,"Kurt lit the last cigarette from a pack they’d split three ways since Tuesday. Memphis leaned against the rusted-out bus stop sign, his hoodie pulled low over his eyes, while El sat cross-legged on the curb, sketching flames on the toe of her Converse with a Sharpie. The sun was just starting to bleed out behind the liquor store, and the air smelled like hot asphalt, cheap beer, and the kind of hope that only comes when you’ve got nothing left to lose.

They were seventeen, seventeen, and sixteen. The Three Musketeers of the trailer park. Bound not by blood, but by bruises, broken promises, and the kind of silence that screams louder than fists. They’d been saving for a year—dishwashing, mowing lawns, selling mixtapes and bootleg tees out the back of the school parking lot. Every dollar folded into a coffee can buried behind Kurt’s mom’s busted-out shed. Every plan whispered under the hum of Nirvana, Rage, and the static of a world that didn’t want them to win.

They weren’t running away. They were running toward something.

Freedom.

They hit the road with $1,142.37, a busted Walkman, and a duffel bag full of secondhand dreams. First stop: a one-room studio above a bodega in a city that didn’t care who they were. Rent was $500 a month, no lease, no questions. The landlord was a Dominican dude named Tito who only asked two things: don’t bring cops, and don’t bring drama.

They could do that.

The first weeks were rough. Ramen and tap water. Cold showers and colder nights. Memphis got a job sweeping hair at a barbershop. El started painting signs for a local tattoo parlor. Kurt hustled odd jobs—moving furniture, cleaning gutters, even one gig dressing up as a hot dog outside a gas station. They were broke, sore, and exhausted.

But they were free.

And that freedom? It tasted like rebellion. Like sweat and spray paint. Like the echo of a guitar riff that made your chest vibrate. They weren’t just surviving—they were becoming.

Still, some nights hit harder than others.

Like the night they hadn’t eaten in two days. The fridge was empty, and the bodega had stopped extending credit. They walked the city with hollow stomachs and heavy feet, trying to distract themselves with music and jokes that didn’t quite land.

That’s when they saw it.

A wallet. Fat. Leather. Just lying there on the sidewalk outside a corner store.

Kurt picked it up. Opened it. Cash. At least $600. Maybe more.

El looked away. Memphis stared at the ground.

They didn’t speak, but the silence was loud.

They could eat. For a week. Maybe even get a space heater. Fix the busted window. Hell, they could breathe for once.

Then they heard it.

“Yo! Has anyone seen a wallet? Please, man, I lost my wallet—my rent money’s in there!”

A man in his forties, frantic, eyes wide with panic. He looked like someone who’d been on the edge before and knew how steep the fall was.

Kurt didn’t hesitate. He walked up, held out the wallet.

“Is this it?”

The man’s face crumpled like paper. “Oh my God. Yes. Yes, that’s it. Thank you. Thank you.”

He opened it, counted the money. Then pulled out a crisp hundred-dollar bill and pressed it into Kurt’s hand.

“You didn’t have to do that. Most wouldn’t. But you did. That means something.”

The store owner had been watching from behind the counter. He stepped outside, arms crossed, nodding slow.

“You three hungry?”

They nodded.

“Come back here every day. One meal. On me. And if you want work, I got shelves that need stocking and windows that need cleaning. You down?”

They were.

That night, they ate like kings. Rice, beans, chicken, and soda so cold it burned going down. They laughed until their ribs hurt. Not because everything was perfect—but because they’d done the right thing when it was hardest. And the world had noticed.

That was the moment they realized: their rebellion wasn’t just noise. It was a voice. A backbone. A declaration that they were more than their scars, more than their zip code, more than what the world expected them to be.

They didn’t fold. They rose.

Day by day, they built something. A life. A rhythm. A code.

They still had nights when the past came knocking. When the echoes of fists on doors or slurred curses in the dark tried to drag them back. But they held each other up. They reminded each other who they were.

Not victims.

Survivors.

Not statistics.

Architects.

Not broken.

Becoming.

And when people asked how they made it, they didn’t talk about luck. They talked about choice. About choosing to be better. To be honest. To be free.

As Maya Angelou once wrote:

“You may not control all the events that happen to you,
But you can decide not to be reduced by them.”

They weren’t reduced.

They were reborn.

And every time they walked past that corner store, they smiled. Because that’s where they proved to the world—and to themselves—that even when you come from nothing, you can still choose to be everything.",2,1763755030.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I’m a PH-based senior software engineer, tech lead and an entrepreneur.  
For the past year, we’ve been running **Ink Wave Branding**, a branding/packaging service for local cafés — designing & printing menus, loyalty cards, and custom-printed paper/plastic cups.

Working closely with dozens of cafés exposed one recurring truth:

**Most café operational problems have nothing to do with coffee — it’s outdated information.**

Here are the issues we saw again and again:

* Menus constantly change (prices, new drinks, promos)
* Out-of-stock items still appear on printed menus
* Staff/kitchen miscommunication due to outdated or incomplete menus
* Loyalty cards run out, get lost, **or customers end up holding different  cards from different merchants**
* Reprinting takes too long (back-and-forth edits → layout → print → delivery)
* Service suffers because the “source of truth” is not centralized

I personally waited **over an hour** for a meal that was already unavailable — staff didn’t know the printed menu was outdated.

We didn’t think much of these problems… until we traveled to **other countries**.

Over there, even small cafés rely on **QR ordering with interactive digital menus**:

* Customers order at their own pace
* Everything is always updated
* No pressure from staff standing beside the table
* No miscommunication

That trip flipped the switch.

The idea isn’t new — the **barrier to adoption is**:

* POS systems are expensive
* Setup fees are high
* Overkill for small cafés
* Contracts are long
* Not built for PH cafés with fast-changing menus

So we asked:  
**Why isn’t there a PH-made, lightweight, affordable QR ordering system tailored for small cafés?**

This became **Dumadine** (short for “Duma Dine”) — built to solve the problems we saw every day.



# 🚀 What We’ve Built (Closed Beta / Early Access)

# Customer Experience

* QR ordering (order at your own pace)
* Dynamic digital menu
* Real-time item availability toggle
* Device-based & user-based order history
* Lightweight UI, mobile-first
* Customizable brand theming
* and more

# Back Office

* Multi-venue support
* Clerk multi-organization (Owner, Admin, Manager, Staff)
* Order dashboard + Kitchen Display System (KDS)
* Basic sales analytics (orders, revenue, active vs served)
* Refunds & voids
* Loyalty rewards configurable per tenant
* and more



# 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Monorepo**
* **Frontend:** ReactJS, React Query, Zustand, Tailwind v4 + shadcn
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Zod, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL. Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and Dependency Injection.
* **Auth:** Clerk multi-organization
* **DX:** Docker for local dev
* **Infra:** Started on AWS (ECS/RDS) → now using **Render** for faster iteration (will scale back when demand requires)



# 🧠 What I’m Looking For From the Community

* Red flags or missing features you spot early
* Insights from anyone building SaaS for local PH businesses
* Thoughts on pricing strategy for PH cafés
* Architecture or approach critiques
* Startup-level feedback before we widen the beta

Not marketing, not pitching — just sharing the build process and learning from the community.

If anyone here wants to contribute to shaping this early stage, I made a short survey to gather insights from café owners, baristas, operators, and fellow founders. It’s a quick form—no email required—and it helps us validate which features matter most. You can fill it out here: **\[**[Survey Link](https://forms.gle/EbfPXg92JwGaoKLT6)**\]**

I met this girl at my work several months ago, she was always super friendly. The first time we met I asked what she was up to that upcoming weekend and she said she was getting married so we talked about how exciting that was. Then leading up over the months to Halloween we saw each other in the halls here and there, she was always super friendly, would wave, say hello how’s it going etc and I’d reciprocate. 

There’s no funny business here at all, I have no intentions other than being friendly. I like to connect with people of all kinds esp as my actual work cohort is cold and anti social. 

Fast forward to Halloween, we saw each other at a work event and we talked about Halloween plans. She was excited about what my costume would be and said “you’ll have to show me some pictures when you’re back in town!” 

So later that day I messaged her on teams and just said hey why don’t we grab coffee next week and I should have some pics by then. 

Clearly, this was a boundary crossed, even though I have done this with several people at the office in a purely platonic way. Just connecting over a walk on break, or coffee on break. I see it happen between others almost daily. She left me on read

A week and a half later we saw each other in the hallway and I just smiled and waved - she was cold, looked away. So I messaged on teams again and said hey I think there’s been some miscommunication here, I meant just a friendly walk on break not asking you out as I know you’re married and wouldn’t think to do something like that. 

She replied “I know you’re not trying to make me feel uncomfortable, but that’s what the situation is. I think it would be best for myself if we didn’t communicate at all. Hope you can respect that.” 

And I just said back that I was very confused how this happened given that she said she said she wanted to see the pictures and was always friendly and said no worries though take care.

WTF?!? Yall, this feels SO extreme. I cant wrap my head around how this was such a disaster. I’m bummed because I feel like she’s probably sharing this with others around her over a total misunderstanding. I feel awful and very hurt. Like I was given no benefit of the doubt. I just about cried when I saw her message, because I’ve been struggling with dating for a long time 
and have TONS of great girl friends, no issue getting those compared to dates. So this was really surprising and made me feel like shit.


TLDR: asked if super friendly married girl at work wanted to go for a coffee after she said she wanted to see my Halloween costume pics once I was back in town. She asked for us to stop talking and said I made her uncomfortable.

On Sunday, I had a day off, but they still brought me a body, It pissed me off, but I  didn’t know that this would probably be my last Cadaver, I remember the Scrubs tightening around my body, I started, I just kept going, but there were Organs that shouldn’t Be in the condition they were, His Lungs were completely black, and his intestines were way too Normal for a Victim of a Stabbing, it weirded me out even more when I learned the stabbing was the stomach area, but I did my Job, I kept Dissecting him, once the Autopsy was done, I sent the reports and put him in the Cabinet, then I went back home and just Fell asleep.

 I woke up, Got some Coffee, and went to work, got another body, and it looked Familiar, Too familiar… I had a bad feeling, but I did it anyway, it was the same, Too normal Intestines, and Black as Coal lungs, but there was a note, it said “It burns” it looked like it was wrote in blood, and ever weirder, it was in the blood stream, but it was barely touched, except for the Writing, I wish I would’ve stopped, but I didn’t… 

5 days in a row. 

The Notes kept getting weirder, the notes were jumbled, like it’s Coded, And It was the same… over, over, and over again, until today, it’s the same, the note says “6:00PM”, I was Even More scared when the back said, End of the line”, I ran to my house and locked the door, that’s where it is right now, I’m probably going to die, I had a good life, but it’s 5:55PM, I have a gun, there’s someone knocking at the door, It’s the fucking Cadaver…

“ By the time they were done passing the bong around, he was fucked. There was something so liberating about having one’s death faked. Sure, some family and friends might have missed him and mourned his death, but now Jackie Orange was as free as a bird lost in the shapeshifting ether as the walls of the room spun clockwise, and the ceiling rotated at a 90-degree angle to the sky.
They downed cold and creamy Irish Car Bombs and watched trippy YouTube visuals
with the sound off and tried to catch how it synchronized with the strobe lights and the music.
“The snozzberries taste like snozzberries, bruh…” said DeShawn. He was bringing in
bowls of what he had been cooking in the kitchen. It was a Sichuan veggie stir-fry with extra mushrooms and it smelled like heaven. They were all laughing, slapping knees, out of breath.
“Hallelujah!” Jackie shouted after taking a bite of the orgasmic food. “Holy shit, I swear
God is real!”
“That comfort food-based religious experience fnords the meta hard!”


“ War was breaking out for real. The DMT mind-rape finished off the already-wounded
canon of the collective unconscious. The bacchanal terrorism and mass destruction had spiraled out of control. Governments blamed each other. Their fear of Ithoshyev made them resort to violence all the quicker.
Jackie was sure this was just as Time’s Laughter would have wanted it.”


“ Maybe I was wrong… the grass here isn’t green… in this new life, it’s all shit brown.
Brown like the coffee I used to enjoy in the EMTV breakroom? Yes… I miss that breakroom. I miss Molly and Tim and Bill… even Vivian! Oh my-lanta…I even miss Josh! That fucking psychopath! Ha! Remember those Halloween donuts he brought? Those little cream-filled jack-o-lanterns… Josh… can’t believe he fucking killed himself and dedicated his life and death to…
God… I wonder what could cause someone to have orange poop.
Oh well… Hail Satan, I guess.”

I applied for the online MSW program at Rutgers back in August and… crickets. No update, no decision, not even a “we’re working on it, relax.” I’ve followed up multiple times but haven’t gotten a clear response.

This is the only program I applied to, so now I’m sitting here wondering if this is normal, or if my application is just chilling in someone’s inbox while they enjoy cafeteria coffee.

Does anyone know the **typical timeline for Rutgers MSW admissions**, especially the online track?  
Should I be following up in a specific way or with a specific office or person?  
And if this limbo continues, **should I apply elsewhere** as a backup this late in the game?

Any tips, advice, or “been there, survived that” stories are very welcome. Thanks in advance! 🙏Applied to Rutgers Online MSW in August, Still No Response… Normal?",1,1763753910.0,rutgers,0,1.0,False

Now I’m Cleaning Up Her Sins.,"I never had a problem with old people. I actually liked being around them. They had that kind of experience — that quiet, heavy wisdom — that only decades of life can give. Maybe that’s why I started doing this job in the first place.
I wanted to do something good. To work for people who’d already worked their whole lives, who’d built the world around them, and who deserved not to be left alone in the end.
I got a job with a company that sent caretakers to elderly people who lived by themselves.
Usually, I was just a visitor — I’d check in on a few old folks during the day, ask if they needed groceries or medicine, maybe do some cleaning or help with little things around the house. Simple work. Quiet work.

They were happy with me, though.
So one day, the company offered me something different — a live-in position in a sleepy little town. An old woman who’d been alone for years needed a full-time caretaker. A local benefactor was paying for everything, since the woman had recently ended up in a wheelchair.
I hesitated. I didn’t really want to leave the city, or my tiny rented apartment, or my usual rhythm of life. But in the end, I thought… why not?
A little change of scenery. A break from the noise. Some peace and trees. I already liked the work — doing it in a quiet place sounded like a bonus.

That’s how I ended up in Mirebrook, a tiny village tucked between the woods and the mountains. The sun was bright that day, the breeze soft and warm, and I stood in front of a small green house whose porch swing creaked slowly in the wind.


“Come in!” called a hoarse, metallic voice just as I knocked.


The little green door creaked open, and I stepped inside, dragging my suitcase behind me.


“Hello!” I called out. “I’m the new caretaker. David.”


No answer — only a faint clatter from somewhere deeper in the house.
It was neat, but old. The walls were lined with black-and-white photos, the shelves cluttered with carved figurines, yellowed trinkets, and things that looked a hundred years old.
I took a few steps toward the noise, and then the beaded curtain to the kitchen parted — a wheelchair rolled through. With one strong push, the chair slid forward, and for a moment I questioned if the woman sitting in it even needed it.


“David?” she asked. Her voice was both kind and commanding.


I nodded and reached out my hand. Her grip was shockingly strong — like being caught in a bear trap.


“Mara,” she said shortly. “Call me Baba Mara.”


I smiled politely, but her face didn’t move. Her wrinkled, yellow-gray eyes studied me — sharp, measuring.


“You help, yes?” she asked dryly.


“Yes, ma’am,” I said, trying to sound friendly.


“Da. David,” she repeated, like testing the sound. “Good hands. Strong hands.”


I just nodded again. You get used to old folks saying strange things.


“Dobre, David.” She pronounced my name in that strange Slavic way, then turned the chair and rolled back toward the kitchen. “Upstairs, second door on right. Then come. Help me.”


The wheels of her chair squeaked rhythmically against the old floorboards as she vanished down the hall.

I carried my bag upstairs, dropped it on the bed. I’d unpack later, once she was asleep. For now, she’d asked for help — so I went back down.

The kitchen was… everything you’d expect from an old lady’s kitchen. Spacious, lived-in, filled with shelves of jars and old tools. Big enough for Mara to move easily around in her chair. She sat at the counter, chopping something with a large, shiny knife.
As soon as I walked in, she glanced at me — then quickly slammed the lid shut on a small brown wooden box sitting on the counter.

I couldn’t help but smirk. Old people could be like children sometimes. When they were hiding something, they did it in the most obvious ways.


“How can I help?” I asked, stepping closer.


The air was heavy with the smell of herbs and spices — sharp, but pleasant.


“Da, da…” she muttered, half to herself. “David, you drive?”


“Uh… drive? Like a car? Yeah, I do.”


Without another word, she turned away from the counter and wheeled herself to the back door. A little cat-shaped key holder hung on the wall beside it, covered in dozens of keys.
Mara grabbed one and thrust it into my hand with surprising force.

I blinked at her, caught off guard.
I’d assumed she’d be frail, helpless — the kind of woman still coming to terms with being stuck in a wheelchair. But no. Even like this, she moved with complete control, like she owned every inch of the place.


“Where are we going?” I asked, studying the car key.


“Mara show you,” she said simply. “Help me outside. To car.”


And she started rolling toward the living room.


“Mara!” I called after her. “Don’t you need that little wooden box?”


“Nye!” she barked — the first real anger I’d heard in her voice. “You no touch that. Not your business.”


Then she pushed open the front door and rolled out into the sunlight, leaving me standing there alone — staring at that closed little box on the counter.



Mara’s ancient Subaru Outback creaked its way down Mirebrook’s narrow streets. For such a small town, it was surprisingly lively even in the late morning. As we drove, everyone seemed to recognize Mara — and probably her twenty-year-old car, too. People waved from sidewalks, some called out friendly hellos at stoplights.
The whole place felt cheerful — almost cozy — and for a moment, I thought maybe I’d made the right choice coming here.


“Mara, where are we going exactly?” I asked after a while, watching as the houses thinned and the road led out of town.


“To man,” she said quietly, her voice flat, mechanical. “Next village. I help him… then… after that, Mara end up in chair. Must see… how he is.”


Then she went silent. For the first time, her stony face cracked a little. Something flickered behind her eyes — fear, regret, maybe both.
We drove on in silence for a few minutes. I tried to make small talk, but she only answered in short, clipped sentences.

From what she did tell me, I pieced together fragments of her life. She had escaped from somewhere in the old Soviet Union — didn’t even remember when she was born.
Her parents had stayed behind, and she never saw them again. Still, everyone in Mirebrook seemed to love her. Respect her. She’d helped so many people here in one way or another.


We never even reached the “next village.”
After ten minutes, Mara told me to turn onto a muddy dirt road far beyond the edge of town.
At the end of it sat a junk-filled lot, the kind of place that looked more like a landfill than private property. Rusted metal, broken furniture, shattered dishes scattered across the ground. And in the center — an old, decaying RV, half-eaten by time and weather. Its windows were gone, its frame dented and collapsing in on itself.


“Uh… we’re here?” I asked, clearing my throat.


“Da, David,” she grumbled, staring out the windshield. “Here. You go in. I cannot walk.”


My stomach tightened. A cold knot formed in my throat as I stared at the trailer. Something about it made every instinct in me scream no.


---


I stood before the RV’s filthy door, not wanting to knock.
I’d seen enough places like this to know who usually lived in them — junkies, drifters, the kind of people you avoided.
Mara had insisted it was safe.


“Sick man,” she’d said on the drive. “I help before. He good man… just lost way.”


I took a deep breath and tapped on the grimy mesh door.
Nothing. No bark, no voice, not even a shuffle inside. Just silence.

I knocked again, harder this time. Still nothing.


“Go in, boy!” Mara shouted from the car, her voice carrying through the still air. “Don’t be chicken!”


I forced a stupid smile at her teasing.


“Yeah, sure,” I muttered. “What the hell am I doing?”


Then I pressed down the rickety handle.
The door swung open — and a wave of stench hit me so hard I nearly gagged on the spot.
Rot. Decay. The wet, sour smell of something long dead. Flies burst out from the crack as I stumbled back, covering my nose, trying to swat them away.
Inside was filth. Broken furniture, soggy carpet, everything coated in grime. Rain had poured in through the shattered roof vent; water pooled on the floor in dark, oily puddles.


“Mara, this is disgusting!” I shouted over my shoulder. “What the hell is this place?”


I glanced toward the car. Her face had gone pale — white as paper. For the first time, she looked afraid.


“David!” she barked suddenly, her voice raw, commanding. “You go in! Bring me what Tom has! Don’t touch it with hands! Wrap it — quick, quick!”


I don’t know why, but I obeyed. Maybe it was her tone — something about it left no room for argument. I stepped inside the trailer.

The smell was unbearable. The buzzing of flies drowned out every other sound. The carpet squelched beneath my shoes.
And then I saw it. The source of the stench.

A man lay sprawled on the bed at the back of the trailer. His body swollen, skin split and glistening in the dim light. His face — puffed, purple — stared up at the ceiling, eyes wide open.
My stomach turned over. I barely made it out the door before I vomited into the dirt.


—


I sat in the car beside Mara.
My whole body was shaking. My mind felt empty, looping only one image — the rotting corpse on that bed.

Earlier, she’d sent me back inside the trailer. She’d yelled at me — like a drill sergeant barking orders at a terrified recruit. And I couldn’t tell which scared me more — her, or what I’d just seen in there.
But I went back.

Using a filthy towel, I pried something out of the dead man’s stiff hand. I barely dared to look at it, but from what I saw, it looked like a small square of metal, like a spinning top, trapped inside a steel cage.
The moment I handed it to Mara, she seemed to relax completely. That thing — that was what she’d been so worried about? She wrapped it up carefully and stuffed it under the seat, as if she’d just recovered treasure.

I just sat there, trembling like jelly. The stench clung to my clothes, the taste of vomit burned my throat. Mara, meanwhile, acted as though nothing had happened. She pulled out her old push-button cell phone and calmly called the police.
They arrived quickly. They knew Mara — and they knew the man, Tom.
She talked to them while I just stared blankly out the window, my brain buzzing.
I’d never seen a dead body before.
The image of it, the bloated skin, the half-eaten flesh, the way the air inside the trailer felt alive with decay — it crawled under my skin and stayed there.
It scared me. And somewhere deep down, it unsettled something else too, something I couldn’t name.


“David,” Mara said softly after a while. Her voice sounded different — gentle, almost grandmotherly. “I know… this hard for you. But Tom… Tom was drug man. Addict.”


I just stared at her, dazed. It was like two people lived inside her. The harsh, commanding woman from before was gone, replaced by a calm, caring old lady.


“This…” she nodded toward the towel-wrapped thing at my feet, “this help him quit.
Give him better addiction. Safer one. But I was sick. Surgery. I not go check him. I only wanted help.”


I nodded slowly. It sounded like it made sense — or maybe I just wanted to believe it. Her voice had that warm, soothing rhythm that made you stop thinking.


“I understand,” I said quietly.


“Good boy,” she whispered, and with her bony, powerful hand she patted my shoulder.
Like a grandmother proud of a child who’d done what he was told. “Now we go home, David,” she said at last. I make you something good to eat.”


---


By the time we got back, dusk had turned her little green house almost golden.
I sat in the kitchen on a small chair while the warm, yellow light filled the room. Mara bustled around like a mother hen — chopping, stirring, moving faster than I thought she could. The smell was rich and strange, like some kind of meat pie I couldn’t place, but it was… comforting.
Now she was loading dishes into the washer, humming under her breath. I offered to help — more than once — but she waved me off.


“You had enough test for one day,” she said.


For a while, I just sat and watched her. In that light, her face looked both young and ancient.
There was a glint in her eyes — like someone who’d seen too much, and still kept going.


“Mara…” I finally said, my voice low. “What was that thing? The one I took from the trailer?”


She didn’t answer right away. Just gave me a sidelong look — sharp and knowing — the kind that made words die in your throat.

When we got back earlier, she’d rolled straight into the little side room off the living room,
the box clutched tightly in her lap. She’d locked the door behind her and stayed inside maybe ten minutes. I’d just sat there on the floral couch, too drained to move.
Now, as I asked again, she seemed to weigh her answer.


“David,” she said at last, her tone slow and measured. “What you take from there… you never tell. Not to anyone. That thing… it is most wonderful thing in world. For little while. But if you use wrong… if you greedy… it take much from you.”


Her words were simple, but they landed heavy. Her voice had cooled again — not angry, just distant. It was clear she felt something about what happened, but Mara wasn’t the crying type. She was the bury-it-deep type.
I didn’t push her. I just nodded and let the silence stretch between us.

That night, before going to bed, a single thought circled my mind:
Tomorrow, I quit. I don’t care about the pay, or the peace, or the pretty view. If my first day ends with a corpse — what the hell’s coming next?


That night was awful.

I thought Mara’s magical dinner would help me forget what I’d seen, but it didn’t. Every time I closed my eyes in that cold little room, the dead man came back. The way he lay there, spread out on the bed. The way I’d had to pull that thing from his hand — like even in death he refused to let go.

I woke early.
The coffee maker was some old yellow relic that took me five minutes to figure out, but eventually it sputtered to life. I sipped the bitter, lukewarm coffee and thought about leaving.
This whole thing had been a mistake. Mara didn’t need me — and I didn’t need this.
If my first day ended with a corpse, what the hell was waiting for me next?


“David, you already up?”


Her voice startled me. Mara rolled silently into the kitchen — not even the wheels of her chair made a sound.


“Oh—uh, yeah,” I stammered. “I’m up. And… I need to talk to you, Mara.”


Her face darkened — not angry, exactly, but watchful. Like she already knew what I was going to say, and had decided she wouldn’t answer.


“We talk later, David,” she said gently. “Now you drive me shopping.”


The request caught me off guard. After yesterday, it felt strangely normal — almost comforting. Like this strange, herb-scented, secretive woman was just an old lady who wanted breakfast and company.


---


At the grocery store, everyone greeted her. People waved, smiled, called her name. One woman complimented her scarf, another asked about her surgery. Everyone had a story — how Mara had helped them once, with herbs, ointments, tea. She was like the town’s grandmother, its quiet healer.

For a moment, I almost forgot the trailer, the corpse, the box. For a moment, I believed this was just a nice, sleepy place full of nice people.
Then an older woman approached us. She smiled warmly and said,


“Mara, how’s Kate doing?”


The air froze.
Mara didn’t answer. She just paid for the groceries and wheeled herself out the door without a word.

The clerk stared after her. I hurried to the parking lot, catching up just as she was pulling herself into the car. She practically ripped the keys from my hand.


“Go, David,” she said flatly.


Her tone was cold again, sharp, commanding. And I knew — something was wrong.

We drove in silence.

I could feel her wanting to explode, to shout and curse, but she held it in. I didn’t dare ask who Kate was, or why the question had upset her so much. I didn’t even know what I wanted anymore. Half of me wanted to run back to my safe, quiet city life. The other half kept whispering that maybe this was just a bad start — that maybe tomorrow would be better.
Then she snapped.


“Bozhe moy, Davíd! Ty vëdёsh’, kak sonnaya kuritsa! Davaj, davaj! Bystree, idi!”


“What?” I asked, frowning in confusion.


“Drive!” she barked. “Faster, David! We must get home!”


Her anger hit me like a wave. I could feel it infecting me — my hands tightening on the wheel, the red lights, the slow cars, all of it clawing at my nerves.


“Mara,” I said finally. “What is this? What’s going on? Who the hell is Kate?”


“Chyort skazhi menya, proklyataya staraya baba!” she shouted suddenly — the foreign words sharp and guttural. Then, more clearly: “Do not ask, David! Just drive!”

I swallowed hard. Whatever this was, it had her terrified.


When we got back, she didn’t wait for me. She climbed out of the car on her own, moving with surprising strength. Didn’t let me help. Didn’t speak. I followed, tense, unloading the groceries.
By the time I stepped inside, she was already rolling back out, a large brown leather bag in her lap, her chair moving faster than I thought possible.


“David, leave that shit!” she snapped. “We have more important thing now!”


“Mara?” I called after her as she reached the door. “What’s going on? Where are you going?”


“I tell you soon, David!” she shouted back, already pulling herself into the car. “Now hurry! Maybe… maybe not too late.”


We were sitting in the car again, parked in front of another house. This time on the outer edge of Mirebrook — the part where even the birds seemed quieter, where the wind blew slower, heavier.

The house itself looked perfect. Two stories, a well-kept yard, flowers by the porch — the kind of home people dream about. But Mara just sat there, staring ahead. She’d hardly spoken the whole drive, mumbling to herself in that strange language I still couldn’t understand. I caught myself sighing, tension pressing in on me.
Something about the house felt wrong. I couldn’t say why, but I prayed I wouldn’t find what I found yesterday. Though, deep down, I knew I was ready for anything by now.


“David,” Mara said suddenly. “We go in together. You help me out.”


I nodded silently. Oddly, I was relieved. At least this time, I wouldn’t be facing whatever it was alone.
She looked weaker than before — fragile, like the air itself was weighing her down. I wheeled her up the short path to the front door. She gestured with one hand for me to ring the bell.
My hand trembled as I pressed the little button. The chime echoed through the house — too loud, painfully loud against the silence. But nothing happened.
No footsteps. No answer.


“I am too late…” Mara whispered. “My fault.”


“What happened, Mara?” I asked softly, resting a hand on her shoulder when I saw the sorrow on her face.


She looked up at me. And for the first time, I saw real pain in her eyes — not the cold, empty kind I’d seen before, but something raw. She wasn’t mourning a mistake. She was mourning a person.


“Don’t blame yourself, Mara,” I said gently. “Come on, let’s check inside.”


I reached for the doorknob and pushed.


To my surprise, the house was spotless. Clean, organized — even the air smelled fresh.
The furniture looked polished, untouched. It was like someone had cleaned just that morning. But no one was there. The house was empty — and oppressively silent.


“Hello?” I called. “Anyone home?”


No response.
Mara sat in her chair clutching that brown leather bag she’d brought along. I turned toward her, forcing a faint smile, trying to lighten the mood. But her face didn’t move.
Then the silence cracked.

A sharp, echoing cry filled the air — a baby’s cry. High-pitched. Desperate. Coming from somewhere inside the house.


“What the hell…” I whispered, stepping back.


“David,” Mara said quickly. Her voice was tight. “Whatever we find… you do exactly what I say. Understand?”


“What is this?” I stammered. “Mara, what—”


“Say you understand!” she snapped.


I nodded, my pulse pounding in my ears. I didn’t understand any of it, but I trusted that Mara — somehow — did. Then, with a sudden burst of strength, she pushed off the armrests of her chair and rolled past me faster than I thought possible.


“Find where baby is crying,” she ordered, already turning toward the nearest door.


The crying grew louder. It came from a small white door off the living room — probably a guest room.
Mara stopped in front of it. She stared at the floor, silent. The crying was right behind that door now — louder, more desperate.


“Mara?” I whispered. “What’s in there? Shouldn’t we help the baby?”


She hesitated, searching for words. Then she lifted her head, and her eyes went cold again.
That commanding stare returned, the same one that made me obey without thinking.


“We go in,” she said. “You do everything I say. No questions.”


I nodded automatically. It was like my will wasn’t my own anymore.
Mara turned the handle. The door creaked open.
And we stepped into a nightmare.


The guest room looked perfect. The bed was made, the walls bright white, everything neatly arranged — except for one thing.
From the ceiling hung a woman.

Her body was gray and shriveled, patches of hair missing from her scalp. She was naked, her ribs jutting out like knives beneath her skin. Her eyes were sunken, her mouth a dark, toothless void. Boils and open sores covered her body — some still oozing dark fluid that dripped onto the floor. But that wasn’t the worst part.

On the floor beneath her, beside a fallen chair, lay a baby.
A newborn girl. Alive. Slick with blood, crying so hard her tiny chest shook.
I couldn’t move .Every muscle locked. My stomach churned, and I felt my throat close. Mara rolled closer, her voice trembling.


“David… I sorry you must see this too.” She looked up at me then, her face pale, her eyes wet with something close to guilt.  “But now… no time. You help me.”


I don’t even know what really happened after that.
My hands were filthy, but I gripped the steering wheel so hard it hurt — like it was the only thing keeping me tied to reality.
The baby lay on the passenger seat beside me, wrapped in a clean white sheet. I drove with one hand and rocked her gently with the other. It wasn’t safe — but I wasn’t myself anymore either.
Mara had ordered me, back in the house. No explanations, no arguments. Her voice carried this awful weight — every word sank deep inside my head until I couldn’t resist her.

The woman — Kate, as it turned out — had hanged herself. I had to cut her down.
Mara had opened her brown leather bag, sprinkled some kind of brown powder over the body, and then pressed a small round metal talisman under Kate’s tongue. After that, she turned to me and gave her commands — cold and clear.


Drive south. Cross three towns. In the fourth, there would be a church. Leave the baby at its gate.

If anyone asked, say I’d found her in the forest. No questions. No hesitation. Mara just grumbled and urged me to go now. 
So here I was, on the highway, carrying a newborn born of a corpse, heading toward some nameless city to abandon her at a church.
My head buzzed. Two days. Two dead bodies. No one would ever believe me.
I spotted the church spire long before I reached it.
And that was when the realization hit me — what I was actually doing.

I pulled into the small parking lot. The engine sputtered and died, leaving only the sound of my ragged breathing. The sun was sinking, turning the world orange-red. I sat there holding the little bundle, rocking it slowly. The blood had dried on her skin, but the smell lingered — faint and metallic.

Then someone appeared by my window. I nearly screamed. But it was just a priest. I rolled the window down.


“Good evening, son,” he said kindly. “Are you all right? You came in quite fast.”


“Yeah… yes, I just— I have a problem,” I stammered.


His eyes drifted to the bundle in my arms. They widened. His face tightened. I could see the thoughts racing through his head — what did this man do?


“Father…” I began. “I—I found her. In the woods. I was hiking and… she was there. On a rock.”


The priest didn’t speak. His expression said he didn’t believe me — but he wasn’t accusing me either. He just studied me, then asked quietly:


“Son… what do you plan to do with this child?”


“I… I want to give her to you,” I said finally, and held the bundle out through the window.


The baby started crying. The air was cold and sharp, yet her tiny voice filled the space completely. The priest took a deep breath, then sighed, weary and human.


“Son, I can’t take care of a newborn,” he said gently. “Take her to the hospital… or the police.”


“Please, Father…” I whispered. “Please, just take her.”


For a few long seconds, he only looked at me — really looked. Then he reached out and took the baby.
And in that instant, it felt like a mountain lifted off my chest. He held the little girl carefully, looked down at her, then back at me. His eyes were dark, unreadable — but not judging.
He said nothing. I started the engine and drove off as fast as I could.

The sun had already dropped behind the hills. The horizon burned red — like drying blood. And I drove back toward Mirebrook.


---


By the time I reached Kate’s house, the street was packed. Police cars, flashing lights, paramedics. Mara was there, talking to an officer, while two medics lifted a black body bag into the ambulance.
I didn’t get out. I just parked across the street, in front of an empty house. A few neighbors stood around whispering, but otherwise the whole street was silent.
I rolled down the window, trying to catch what the police were saying, but I didn’t need to hear it. I knew. Mara was lying to them.

I didn’t have to wait long. One of the officers wheeled her over to my car and left us alone. Mara looked at me, her face calm again.


“You did what I asked?” she whispered, smiling politely at the officer as he walked away.


“Yes,” I said hoarsely. “She’s where you said. At the church.”


“Good.” Mara nodded. “Then it is done. You didn’t tell anyone where she was born, da?”


I shook my head. Got out to help her into the passenger seat. We sat there in silence for a moment. Then I finally asked,


“What’s going on, Mara? What happened to Kate?”


Mara sighed deeply. Her hands trembled in her lap.

“David… is hard to say,” she sighed. “Kate… she was sick. Depressed. It start when she find out she is pregnant. She not want baby. She not even want… man.”


She fell silent. I stared at her, trying to process what she was saying. It felt like I’d stepped into a place where everyone hid something — especially the one person I was supposed to trust.


“Kate is my sin,” Mara said finally. “Boże wybacz…” Her voice broke. She lowered her eyes. “I not go to her. I promise, but I not go.”


“What did you promise, Mara?” I asked softly.


She looked up at me. The usual steel in her eyes was gone. All that remained was exhaustion — and guilt.


“With baby,” she whispered. “She should not be born. I was to help… so she never know she was pregnant.”


I froze.


“Oh my God…” I breathed.


“God has nothing to do with that girl,” Mara said flatly. Her tone was colder than ever. “That child… is my sin.”

—


When I came down to the kitchen that morning, Mara was already there. Something sweet was baking — warm, comforting smells filled the tiny house.


“Good morning, David,” she said kindly.


“Morning, Mara,” I answered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.


 I sat at the counter and just watched her move. Two days had been enough to learn one thing: Mara would ask if she wanted help. If I offered before that, she’d just get irritated.
For a while, the only sound was the soft hiss of the pan. Then, without turning around, she spoke.


“David, I know you want to quit.” Her tone was calm, matter-of-fact. “But please, stay one more day. Help me.”


I couldn’t answer right away. Part of me froze — how the hell did she know? Then it hit me: what sane person wouldn’t want to leave after all this?


“Fine, Mara,” I said at last. “I’ll stay. Just for today. But only on one condition — if I don’t see another corpse.”


She smiled — not mockingly, but softly, tiredly. Probably not the kind of first week she’d imagined for me either.
After a pause, as she set the pan aside, I spoke again.


“Mara… can I ask you something? Who are you, really?”


She turned toward me slowly. Her eyes looked dark and warm at the same time, like deep water in candlelight.


“Vedunya,” she said simply.


I repeated the word under my breath, rolling it around on my tongue.


“And… what does that mean?”


Mara chuckled — not loudly, but with a kind of weary wisdom.


“You know what it means, little son,” she said, giving me a playful wink. “Now set table. We eat.”


After breakfast, I did the dishes. Mara said she had something to take care of and locked herself in one of the rooms. When she came back, she was at the kitchen door.


“David, come,” she called, gesturing. “Need your help.”


I followed her through the living room, down the narrow hallway that led to the basement and bathroom. Without a word, she opened the basement door. That’s when I noticed the small brown wooden box sitting in her lap — the same one I’d seen on the day we met.
Then she leaned forward and shouted into the darkness below:


“Come up!”


My blood froze. Come up? What the hell was supposed to come up?
I didn’t even want to imagine what she kept down there. Then I heard it — soft, light footsteps on the stairs.
Childlike.
And sure enough, at the bottom of the steps, a small boy appeared.


“Mara, Jesus Christ!” I hissed. “You keep kids locked in your basement?!”


“Ah, shush, David!” she snapped, irritated. “Not child. You’ll see.”


The boy reached the top of the stairs. And for once, I believed her. That thing might have looked eight years old — but it wasn’t a child.
He was completely hairless. No eyebrows, no lashes, not even peach fuzz. His skin was pale and smooth, his eyes glowed faintly yellow, his mouth hung open just a little — and inside, no teeth. He just stood there, motionless, blank, like a puppet waiting for a command.


“Mara, what the hell is this?” I whispered harshly. “Who is this kid?”


“Told you, not kid,” Mara replied coolly, already wheeling herself back toward the kitchen.


I followed — and so did the boy, silent as a shadow.


“Stop, Mara!” I snapped. “What’s going on? You keep something locked in your basement? This is insane!”


She stopped by the counter.


“David, this… not human,” she said evenly. “I do nothing to it. But we must do something. It cannot stay with people.”


I just shook my head, nerves fraying. Another madness. Another nightmare.


“This is bullshit!” I yelled. “You can’t keep a kid locked up! This is beyond wrong!”


Mara’s hand shot out.
She grabbed a knife from the counter — faster than I could react, and drove it straight into the boy’s chest.
All the way in.
I gasped, stumbling back, staring in disbelief. The boy didn’t fall. Didn’t bleed. Didn’t even flinch.


—


I was sitting in that damned car again. This time, I was alone — or… almost.
On the back seat sat that strange, hairless boy. Perfectly still.
He didn’t speak, didn’t blink — just stared ahead with an empty, glassy look.
And when my eyes met his in the mirror, it felt like something was staring back from deep inside that emptiness.

That morning, Mara had made me promise to go. She’d said, 


“He cannot stay with people.”


I’d tried to argue — told her this was insane, that none of this made sense — but her voice settled into my skull like a command. And I couldn’t say no.
She’d handed me the small wooden box too. Told me to take the boy deep into the forest, leave him there, and bury the box in the ground at that same spot.


“He stay there. That is where he belong,” she said.


It didn’t sound hard. Just… wrong. Unnaturally wrong.
The drive was long. Every minute that passed, the tension in me built higher. The boy sat silently behind me. Sometimes I wasn’t even sure he was breathing. I didn’t dare look in the rearview mirror.

Then — a truck horn. Loud. Piercing. Like an alarm inside a dream.
I panicked, jerked the wheel — I’d drifted into the opposite lane. The tires screamed. The car fishtailed. I yanked it back just in time.
Stopped.
My heart hammered so hard it hurt.
For a few seconds, I just sat there, gasping. Then I saw the little wooden box on the passenger-side floor.


“Shit…” I muttered, pulling over to the side.


I leaned down to grab it. The lid had popped open. And a weird, greenish-purple dust covered the mat, no, not dust. Ash. Fine, metallic-smelling ash, like burnt flesh.
The box was empty.

Then — everything went dark.
Like someone had flipped a switch in my head. My vision tunneled. The sound drained out of the world. And I was gone. No thoughts, no fear — just blackness.


Then suddenly, the lights came back on. My sight cleared. The sounds rushed in.
The engine was still idling, rumbling softly. I wasn’t moving. The car was parked at the edge of the forest, the headlights cutting into the fog between the trees.
It was fully dark now. The beams of light sliced through the mist, painting the trunks a ghostly white. 
Where the hell am I? flashed through my mind, then I remembered. The boy.

I whipped around. And I didn’t know which would be worse — if he was still there, or if he wasn’t.
The back seat was empty. The door hung wide open.

I jumped out of the car. Looked around.
Nothing. No sound. No movement. No footprints in the mud. Like he had simply… evaporated.
I raked a hand through my hair, trembling. A knot of fear and guilt twisted inside me. I’d lost what Mara had entrusted to me, and yet, part of me felt relief.
Then another thought hit. That thing was out here somewhere.
Loose.


“Goddammit…” I hissed under my breath.


I shut off the engine but left the headlights on, just to have a little light. And then, for some reason I still can’t explain, I went into the woods.
Maybe it was duty. Maybe curiosity. Or maybe Mara’s voice still echoing in my mind, whispering commands I couldn’t ignore.
I didn’t have to go far. After a few dozen steps, between the trees, I saw something crouched on the ground. Still. Animal-like.
I lifted my phone and turned on the flashlight. And God, I wish I hadn’t.

It was the boy. That gray shirt, that bald head, those glowing yellow eyes. He was shoving something furry into his mouth. Whole. His jaw was stretched impossibly wide, like a snake swallowing a rabbit. His face twisted and spasmed as his throat bulged and popped. I heard the tiny bones crack between his teethless gums.

My stomach lurched. My legs went weak. Every instinct screamed: run.

I don’t remember getting back to the car. Just the squeal of the tires as I tore out of the forest. The stench of burning rubber. And my shaking hands on the wheel as I sped back toward Mirebrook.


---


The door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. I was back in Mara’s house — furious, terrified, done.
Mara rolled out from the kitchen, startled. The old wheelchair screeched across the floor.


“David, what happened?” she asked, tense, frightened.


I didn’t answer. I was already on the stairs, heading for my room. I shoved clothes into my bag, not even caring what I grabbed — I was leaving. Tonight.


“David!” she called again. “What happened? You left the package?”


No reply. I zipped the bag shut and stormed downstairs.
Mara was waiting near the bottom, her face tight with anger — but it wasn’t me she was angry at. It was the thing I’d lost.


“David!” she barked. “You left boy, da? With box?”


“Leave me the hell alone!” I shouted. “No, I didn’t leave him! That… thing escaped!
It got into my head — or I don’t know what it did! I don’t care anymore!”


I tried to push past her, but she grabbed my wrist. Her grip was shockingly strong — it hurt.


“Let go!” I yelled, jerking free. “I’m done, Mara! Three days, and all I’ve seen is death and madness! You’re crazy — and this whole goddamn place is cursed!”


I stormed to the door, grabbed the handle — and froze.


“David, you go nowhere,” Mara said calmly. Her voice was low, cold, final. “You stay. You fix what you break. I not say again.”


I don’t know what happened to me then. The fury just… vanished. The heat in my chest went out like a blown candle.
I stood there, my hand still on the door. A strange calm came over me — hollow and heavy.

I let go of the handle. My body moved on its own. I turned, climbed the stairs again,
threw the bag into the corner, and slammed the door like a sulking teenager.


“Then I’m not going anywhere,” I muttered to the empty room.

Like many people, I always wake up a minute or two before my alarm, no matter what time I set it, even if it's hours different than normal. 

But it gets weird after that. 

When I set a timer (47 minutes before I need to move the laundry, say), I can be sitting watching TV (obviously I forget all about the laundry within seconds). About ten seconds before the timer goes, I feel a PING in my head and I jump up. 

I'm always already walking toward toward the kitchen when the Alexa timer starts blaring and my wife thinks I'm a witch 🤣 (not wrong?)

When I wake in the middle of the night, I always know almost exactly what time it is, within 10 minutes or so. 

During the day, I don't wear a watch and don't look at my phone much but I always know to the minute what time it is. 

I never arrive late. I also never arrive early. I arrive on the minute because I know exactly how long everything will take to do (barring unforseen traffic, etc).   

I always know exactly how much time has elapsed since something occurred. Recently: ""How long have we been riding this 6 person bike? We forgot to check the time when we rented it."" Without thinking, I said, 47 minutes, and was right, proven when we returned it. 

Along with this, I can count while talking (dealing cards in a game, for example, or number of scoops of coffee). 

I also count without trying or thinking about it. Casting on stitches for knitting has always been a game. Need to cast on 340? Cast on while watching TV or chatting, stop when my body to goes PING. When I count I'm most usually exactly right, or if I'm off it's by fewer than five. 

This counting and time sense feels the same in my body and brain, as if something else is clicking along, doing all the tracking behind the scenes.

Before I knew it, mornings weren't about coffee anymore. They were about getting that first drink in before anyone noticed, I became an expert at timing it so no one would catch me.

# Understanding Anxiety: The Basics (No PhD Required)

Let me tell you something about the anxiety definition that nobody puts in textbooks—anxiety is basically your brain's smoke detector going off when you're making toast. The anxiety meaning in scientific terms refers to a persistent state of excessive worry, fear, or apprehension that can significantly impact your daily functioning. But real talk? It's your body's security system that got a firmware update it definitely didn't need.

When psychologists and psychiatrists talk about anxiety disorder, they're referring to a clinical condition where anxiety symptoms become so intense and persistent that they interfere with your ability to live a normal life. It's not just being nervous before a job interview—that's regular human stuff. We're talking about anxiety that shows up uninvited like that one cousin at Thanksgiving who eats all the macaroni and cheese before everyone else gets there.

According to the [Global Burden of Disease Study 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8157816/), anxiety disorders affected approximately 4.05% of the global population, translating to 301 million people. That number jumped significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 25% increase in anxiety and depression worldwide. So if you're feeling anxious, you're definitely not alone—you've got more company than a Costco on a Saturday afternoon.

[Struggling with sleep due to anxiety? Discover 15 surprising factors keeping you up at night](https://medium.com/@tmapendembe/why-cant-i-sleep-15-surprising-factors-that-are-keeping-you-up-at-night-be7d8d88d6c7)

# Types of Anxiety: More Flavors Than a Ice Cream Shop

Just like there are different types of pizza (and yes, pineapple counts, fight me), there are different types of anxiety disorders. Let's break them down:

# Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

Generalized anxiety disorder is like having a browser with 47 tabs open, and 38 of them are playing different alarm sounds, but you can't figure out which ones. People with GAD experience excessive, persistent worry about various aspects of daily life—work, health, family, finances—even when there's little or no reason to worry. Research published in the [Journal of Psychiatric Research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3684250/) shows that GAD affects approximately 3-5% of the population and is more prevalent in women than men.

It's like your brain decided to become a professional worry consultant but forgot to charge you for the service. You're getting all the anxiety for free! What a deal!

# Social Anxiety Disorder

Social anxiety disorder is your brain convinced that everyone at the party is secretly judging your outfit, your laugh, and the way you're holding that red cup. It's characterized by intense fear of social situations where you might be scrutinized or embarrassed. Studies indicate that social anxiety disorder affects approximately 7-13% of the Western population during their lifetime.

I'm talking about the kind of anxiety where you rehearse ordering at a drive-thru like you're about to deliver a TED Talk. ""Yes, hi, I would like—wait, did I sound weird? Should I start over? Do they think I'm weird now? I'm never eating again.""

# Panic Disorder

Panic disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks—sudden surges of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes. During a panic attack, you might experience heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, and feelings of impending doom. The prevalence of panic disorder ranges from 1.5% to 5% in community populations.

Panic attacks are like your body's way of hitting the emergency exit button on life, except there is no emergency, and there's definitely no exit. You're just sitting there at Chipotle trying to decide between chicken or steak, and suddenly your body thinks you're fighting a lion. Sir, this is a restaurant.

# Separation Anxiety

While separation anxiety is commonly associated with children, adults can experience it too. It involves excessive fear or anxiety about separation from attachment figures. In children, it might look like refusing to go to school; in adults, it might manifest as excessive worry about loved ones' safety.

Kids with separation anxiety act like their parents are going on a space mission when they're literally just going to Target for 30 minutes. And honestly? After the pandemic, some adults developed this too. We all became that clingy friend who texts ""wyd"" every five minutes.

# Health Anxiety

Health anxiety (formerly known as hypochondriasis) involves excessive worry about having or developing a serious illness. Every headache becomes a brain tumor, every cough is pneumonia, and that weird feeling in your left pinky? Definitely a rare tropical disease you read about on WebMD at 2 AM.

The internet has not helped with this. Before Google, if you had a headache, you took an aspirin and went on with your day. Now? You're diagnosing yourself with 47 different conditions, planning your funeral, and updating your will—all before lunch.

# Anxiety Symptoms: Your Body's Weird Way of ""Helping""

The signs of anxiety can manifest in three main categories: physical, psychological, and behavioral. Let's talk about these anxiety symptoms in a way that actually makes sense.

# Physical Symptoms

Your body during anxiety attacks is like a car alarm that goes off when a leaf touches it. Physical symptoms include:

* Rapid heartbeat (your heart's trying to audition for a drum solo)
* Sweating (suddenly you're producing enough sweat to water a small garden)
* Trembling or shaking (you're vibrating on frequencies only dogs can hear)
* Shortness of breath (breathing feels like trying to suck a thick milkshake through a coffee stirrer)
* Dizziness or lightheadedness
* Nausea or digestive issues (your stomach's doing backflips it never trained for)
* Muscle tension (you're clenched tighter than someone watching a horror movie)
* Fatigue (you're tired from being anxious about being tired)
* Insomnia and sleep disturbances
* Headaches and migraines

Recent neuroscience research has revealed fascinating insights into the brain chemistry behind these symptoms. A [2024 study published in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-03-anxiety-young-women-imbalance-brain.html) found that anxiety in young women may stem from an imbalance between two brain chemicals: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. GABA acts as the brain's ""brake,"" while glutamate is the ""accelerator."" When the brake system becomes overactive, it can lead to impaired rational thought and anxiety symptoms.

# Psychological Symptoms

Your thoughts during anxiety are like a Netflix series where every episode ends on a cliffhanger, except all the cliffhangers are about things that probably won't happen:

* Excessive worry and rumination
* Racing thoughts (your brain's running a marathon without your permission)
* Difficulty concentrating (trying to focus with anxiety is like trying to watch TV while someone's constantly changing the channel)
* Irritability (everyone becomes annoying when you're anxious, even your favorite people)
* Fear of losing control
* Sense of impending danger or doom
* Intrusive thoughts
* Catastrophic thinking (if one thing goes wrong, clearly the entire universe is collapsing)

# Behavioral Symptoms

People experiencing anxiety might:

* Avoid situations that trigger anxiety (which eventually becomes avoiding everything, including fun)
* Seek constant reassurance
* Engage in compulsive behaviors
* Experience difficulty in social situations
* Procrastinate excessively (anxiety's favorite hobby is making you wait until the absolute last minute, then panicking)

# Anxiety vs. Other Things That Feel Similar But Aren't

# Anxiety vs Stress

People often confuse anxiety vs stress, but they're different. Stress is a response to an external trigger—like a deadline, an argument, or realizing you left your phone at home. Anxiety, on the other hand, is typically more persistent and can exist without an obvious external cause.

Stress is like ""I have a presentation tomorrow and I'm nervous."" Anxiety is like ""I have a presentation in three months, and I've already imagined 47 different ways it could go wrong, including a scenario where the building catches fire mid-PowerPoint.""

# Anxiety vs Depression

The relationship between anxiety vs depression is complicated—they're like cousins who show up to the same family reunion uninvited. While they're distinct conditions, they often occur together. Depression involves persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest, while anxiety involves excessive worry and fear. About 60% of people with anxiety also experience symptoms of depression, and vice versa.

Depression tells you ""nothing matters,"" while anxiety screams ""everything matters way too much!"" Together, they're the worst comedy duo that never asked to perform at your brain's club.

# Who Gets Anxiety? (Spoiler: Potentially Everyone)

# Anxiety in Different Life Stages

**Anxiety in Children**: Approximately one in five children aged 6-17 experience anxiety. Kids these days are stressed about things we never even thought about—social media, climate change, school shootings, the economy. When I was a kid, my biggest worry was whether I'd get the toy I wanted from the cereal box. Now kids are worried about student loans before they can even do long division.

**Anxiety in Teens**: Adolescents face unique pressures that contribute to anxiety. A [2024 study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11651023/) found that anxiety disorders among those aged 10-24 increased by 52% from 1990 to 2021, with particularly sharp increases after 2019. Between academic pressure, social media comparison, and trying to figure out who they are while everyone's watching, teenagers are basically living in a pressure cooker.

**Anxiety in Adults**: Around 18% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders. Work stress, financial concerns, relationship issues, and the general chaos of adult life (like realizing you have to make your own doctor's appointments now) all contribute to adult anxiety.

# Gender Differences

**Anxiety in Women**: Research consistently shows that anxiety disorders are more prevalent in women than men. Women are approximately 1.6 times more likely to be affected by anxiety disorders. This isn't because women are ""weaker""—hormonal fluctuations, societal pressures, and differences in brain chemistry all play significant roles.

**Anxiety in Men**: While men experience anxiety less frequently than women statistically, they're also less likely to seek treatment due to stigma and societal expectations around masculinity. Men often experience anxiety symptoms differently, sometimes manifesting as irritability or anger rather than worry.

# Causes of Anxiety: Why Your Brain Betrayed You

Understanding the causes of anxiety is like trying to solve a mystery where every clue leads to three more questions. It's rarely just one thing—it's usually a combination of factors doing a group project together (and we all know how those turn out).

# Anxiety and Genetics

If anxiety runs in your family, you might be genetically predisposed to developing an anxiety disorder. Research suggests that about 30-40% of the variance in anxiety disorders can be attributed to genetic factors. So if your parents were anxious, there's a chance you inherited more than just their eye color—you got their overactive worry system too. Thanks, Mom and Dad!

# Anxiety and Brain Chemistry

The neuroscience behind anxiety is fascinating and complex. Your brain operates using neurotransmitters—chemical messengers that help different parts of your brain communicate. When it comes to anxiety and brain chemistry, several key players are involved:

**Anxiety and Serotonin**: Often called the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter, serotonin helps regulate mood, sleep, and anxiety. Low serotonin levels are associated with increased anxiety and depression. It's like your brain's happiness DJ forgot to bring enough music to the party.

**Anxiety and Dopamine**: This neurotransmitter is involved in reward and motivation. Abnormal dopamine activity has been linked to anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety disorder. [Studies have shown](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3684250/) that instability in dopaminergic responses to social stress contributes to anxiety severity.

**Anxiety and GABA**: As mentioned earlier, GABA is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter—the brakes on your neural activity. When GABA function is disrupted, it can lead to increased anxiety. Benzodiazepines, a class of anti-anxiety medications, work by enhancing GABA's effects.

**Anxiety and Cortisol**: This is your body's main stress hormone. Chronic anxiety can lead to elevated cortisol levels, creating a vicious cycle where stress hormones keep your anxiety system activated like a car alarm that won't turn off.

**Anxiety and Norepinephrine**: Also known as noradrenaline, this neurotransmitter is involved in your fight-or-flight response. Hyperactivity in the noradrenergic system is associated with increased anxiety and panic symptoms.

A groundbreaking [2024 study from the Institute for Neurosciences](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251104013004.htm) discovered that overactive neurons in the amygdala drive anxiety and social withdrawal, but rebalancing their activity reversed these effects in mice. This research reveals how specific neural circuits in the brain can be targeted for more precise anxiety treatments.

# Anxiety Psychology: The Mental Framework

From an anxiety psychology perspective, how we think about and interpret events significantly impacts our anxiety levels. Cognitive distortions—like catastrophizing (assuming the worst will happen), black-and-white thinking, and fortune-telling—can fuel anxiety. Your brain becomes a creative writer, but instead of writing novels, it's writing horror stories about your life.

# Environmental Factors and Life Experiences

**Anxiety and Trauma**: Traumatic experiences can rewire the brain's threat-detection systems, making you more susceptible to anxiety. Early-life stress, such as childhood trauma or neglect, has lasting impacts on brain development and increases the risk of anxiety disorders later in life.

**Anxiety and PTSD**: Post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders often co-occur. PTSD involves specific trauma-related triggers, while generalized anxiety might not have such clear origins. But they're basically roommates who don't get along but are stuck in the same apartment.

**Anxiety and Work Stress**: Modern work culture, with its constant connectivity and pressure to perform, contributes significantly to anxiety. Work-related stress, financial instability, and the blurring of work-life boundaries (especially with remote work) have increased anxiety levels among adults.

**Anxiety and School Stress**: Academic pressure has reached unprecedented levels. Students face intense competition, standardized testing, college admissions stress, and the pressure to constantly achieve. It's like running a marathon where the finish line keeps moving further away.

**Anxiety and Relationships**: Relationship anxiety can manifest as fear of abandonment, excessive worry about a partner's feelings, or difficulty trusting others. Your brain starts treating your relationship like it's a final exam you need to pass or the world ends.

**Anxiety and Parenting**: Parental anxiety is real and valid. You're responsible for keeping a tiny human alive while also worrying about their future, their health, their happiness, and whether you're messing them up with your parenting decisions. No pressure.

# Anxiety and Physical Health: The Mind-Body Connection

# Anxiety and Chronic Illness

Living with chronic illness often comes with anxiety about symptoms, prognosis, and treatment. Similarly, anxiety can exacerbate physical health problems, creating a bidirectional relationship that's harder to manage than a long-distance relationship with trust issues.

**Anxiety and Heart Disease**: Chronic anxiety can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and inflammation—all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Your heart is already working hard; anxiety makes it work overtime without paying time-and-a-half.

**Anxiety and IBS**: The gut-brain connection is real. Irritable bowel syndrome and anxiety frequently co-occur, with stress and anxiety triggering or worsening digestive symptoms. Your stomach has feelings too, apparently, and they're very dramatic.

**Anxiety and Chronic Pain**: Pain and anxiety share neural pathways in the brain. Chronic pain can trigger anxiety, and anxiety can lower your pain threshold and amplify pain sensations. It's like they're in a terrible friendship where they make each other worse.

**Anxiety and Migraines**: Stress and anxiety are common migraine triggers. The relationship is bidirectional—anxiety can trigger migraines, and the fear of getting a migraine can increase anxiety. It's a vicious cycle that nobody asked for.

# Anxiety and Lifestyle Factors

**Anxiety and Sleep/Insomnia**: Anxiety makes it hard to fall asleep, stay asleep, or feel rested. Meanwhile, poor sleep increases anxiety. It's like a never-ending chicken-and-egg situation, except both the chicken and the egg are stressed out.

**Anxiety and Diet**: What you eat affects your brain chemistry. Certain foods can worsen anxiety, while others may help manage it. Your brain is basically saying ""please feed me appropriately or I will make your life difficult.""

**Anxiety and Caffeine**: That third cup of coffee might be giving you more than just energy—it could be ramping up your anxiety. Caffeine stimulates the nervous system and can trigger or worsen anxiety symptoms. Your body on too much caffeine is like a car revving in neutral—lots of noise and vibration, not going anywhere productive.

**Anxiety and Alcohol**: Some people use alcohol to self-medicate anxiety, but it often backfires. While alcohol might temporarily reduce anxiety, it can increase anxiety during withdrawal and disrupt sleep, creating more problems than it solves. Plus, nothing says ""I'm handling my anxiety well"" like making decisions you'll be anxious about the next morning.

**Anxiety and Smoking**: Nicotine's effects on anxiety are complicated—it might provide temporary relief but ultimately worsens anxiety over time. Smoking is basically your anxiety's toxic ex that keeps showing up pretending things will be different this time.

**Anxiety and Exercise**: Regular physical activity is one of the most effective natural anxiety reducers. Exercise reduces stress hormones, increases endorphins, improves sleep, and boosts self-confidence. It's like a pharmacy, therapy session, and celebration all rolled into one sweaty package.

# Modern Life and Anxiety: Welcome to the Digital Age

# Anxiety and Technology

**Anxiety and Social Media**: Social media platforms are designed to keep you engaged, but they're also anxiety-generating machines. Constant comparison, FOMO (fear of missing out), cyberbullying, and the pressure to present a perfect life online all contribute to anxiety. You're comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel, and your brain thinks that's a fair comparison. Spoiler: it's not.

**Anxiety and News**: The 24-hour news cycle, with its constant stream of crises, disasters, and conflicts, can fuel anxiety. Your brain wasn't designed to process global catastrophes all day, every day, while you're eating cereal.

# Anxiety and Global Concerns

**Anxiety and Climate Change**: Climate anxiety or eco-anxiety is increasingly common, especially among younger generations. Concerns about environmental destruction, extreme weather events, and an uncertain future contribute to persistent worry and feelings of helplessness.

**Anxiety and Economy**: Economic uncertainty, job insecurity, inflation, housing costs, and financial stress are major anxiety triggers. When you're worried about making rent, your brain doesn't really care about self-actualization—it's stuck in survival mode.

**Anxiety and Politics**: Political polarization, contentious elections, and divisive social issues can create persistent anxiety. It's hard not to be anxious when every headline sounds like the opening scene of a disaster movie.

**Anxiety and War**: Global conflicts, humanitarian crises, and the threat of violence create collective anxiety. Even if you're not directly affected, exposure to these events through media can impact your mental health.

**Anxiety and Uncertainty/Future**: Uncertainty about the future—whether personal, societal, or global—is a significant anxiety trigger. Humans crave predictability, and modern life offers very little of it.

**Anxiety and Death**: Existential anxiety about mortality is a fundamental human experience. Some people develop intense anxiety about death and dying, which can interfere with their ability to live fully in the present.

# Getting Help: Anxiety Diagnosis and Testing

# Anxiety Test and Diagnosis

If you suspect you have an anxiety disorder, getting a proper anxiety diagnosis is important. Mental health professionals use several methods:

**Anxiety Quiz and Assessment Tools**: Various screening questionnaires help assess anxiety symptoms, severity, and type. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) are commonly used tools. These aren't definitive diagnoses but can indicate whether you should seek professional evaluation.

**Professional Evaluation**: A comprehensive anxiety diagnosis involves:

* Detailed clinical interview about symptoms, duration, and impact on functioning
* Assessment of symptom patterns and triggers
* Evaluation for co-occurring conditions (like depression or substance use)
* Physical examination to rule out medical conditions that can mimic anxiety

Don't try to diagnose yourself using just Google. WebMD will have you convinced you have every disease known to humanity plus three that haven't been discovered yet.

# Anxiety Treatment: There's Hope (Seriously)

The good news is that anxiety disorders are highly treatable. We're not stuck with anxious brains forever—there are proven interventions that actually work. Is there an anxiety cure? Not exactly, but there are definitely ways to manage it effectively and significantly improve quality of life.

# Anxiety Therapy and Counseling

**CBT for Anxiety**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is the gold standard for anxiety treatment. CBT helps you identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety. It's like updating your brain's operating system to fix the bugs that keep causing crashes.

Studies show CBT is effective for various anxiety disorders, with success rates ranging from 60-80%. It teaches you that just because your brain says ""THIS IS A DISASTER,"" doesn't mean it actually is one.

**Exposure Therapy for Anxiety**: This involves gradually facing feared situations in a safe, controlled way. It might sound terrifying (because it kind of is at first), but it's incredibly effective, especially for specific phobias, social anxiety, and panic disorder. You're basically teaching your brain ""Hey, remember that thing you said would kill us? We did it and we're fine. Maybe chill out next time.""

**DBT for Anxiety**: Dialectical Behavior Therapy, originally developed for borderline personality disorder, has been adapted for anxiety treatment. DBT emphasizes mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. It's particularly helpful when anxiety is accompanied by intense emotions or impulsive behaviors.

**Other Therapeutic Approaches**:

* Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
* Psychodynamic therapy
* Interpersonal therapy
* Group therapy and anxiety support groups

# Anxiety Medication: The Chemical Support Team

When therapy alone isn't enough, anxiety medication can help manage symptoms:

**SSRIs and SNRIs**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (like Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like Effexor, Cymbalta) are first-line medications for anxiety disorders. They work by increasing serotonin and/or norepinephrine in the brain.

**Benzodiazepines**: Medications like Xanax, Klonopin, and Ativan provide rapid anxiety relief but are typically used short-term due to dependence risk. They're like the emergency brake—effective but not something you want to rely on for daily driving.

**Other Medications**: Beta-blockers (for physical symptoms), buspirone, and certain anticonvulsants are also used for anxiety treatment.

**Important Note**: Medication decisions should always be made with a healthcare provider. What works for your friend might not work for you, and that's okay. Finding the right medication is sometimes like dating—you might have to try a few before finding the right match.

# Natural Remedies for Anxiety and Holistic Treatments

Many people successfully manage anxiety using holistic anxiety treatments and natural approaches:

**Mindfulness for Anxiety**: Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. Research shows regular mindfulness practice can significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. It's like teaching your brain to stop time-traveling to worst-case scenarios.

**Meditation for Anxiety**: Various meditation techniques, from guided meditation to transcendental meditation, have been shown to reduce anxiety. Even just 10-15 minutes daily can make a difference. Your brain needs a break from running disaster simulations 24/7.

**Yoga for Anxiety**: Combining physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation, yoga reduces anxiety by calming the nervous system and reducing cortisol levels. It's like a moving meditation that also happens to be exercise. Multi-tasking at its finest.

**Breathing Exercises for Anxiety**: Controlled breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation. Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, the 4-7-8 technique, and box breathing can quickly reduce anxiety symptoms. Deep breathing is like hitting the reset button on your nervous system.

**Relaxation Techniques for Anxiety**: Progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, and guided imagery can reduce physical tension and mental anxiety. Your body and mind are connected—when you relax one, the other follows.

**Herbal Supplements**: Some people find relief with supplements like:

* Chamomile
* Lavender
* Passionflower
* L-theanine
* Omega-3 fatty acids
* Magnesium

Always consult a healthcare provider before starting supplements, as they can interact with medications and aren't regulated the same way as pharmaceuticals.

# Anxiety Self-Help and Management Strategies

# Anxiety Coping Strategies for Daily Life

**Managing Anxiety Daily** involves creating a lifestyle that supports mental health:

1. **Establish Routine**: Structure reduces uncertainty, which reduces anxiety. Your brain likes knowing what's coming next—it's less likely to panic when it has a schedule.
2. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Both can worsen anxiety. Switch to decaf after noon, and be mindful of alcohol use.
3. **Prioritize Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours nightly. Create a relaxing bedtime routine. Your brain needs quality sleep to function properly—running on sleep debt is like trying to drive with an empty gas tank.
4. **Regular Exercise**: Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days. Even a walk around the block counts.
5. **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet supports brain health. Consider reducing processed foods and sugar, which can affect mood and energy.
6. **Social Connection**: Maintain relationships with supportive people. Isolation feeds anxiety like gasoline feeds fire.
7. **Set Boundaries**: Learn to say no. You can't do everything, and trying to will definitely increase anxiety.
8. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Anxiety is hard enough without your inner critic joining the party.

# Anxiety Support Groups and Online Resources

You don't have to manage anxiety alone:

* **Anxiety Support Groups**: In-person or online groups provide community, validation, and coping strategies from others who understand.
* **Online Therapy for Anxiety**: Teletherapy platforms make professional help more accessible. Services like BetterHelp, Talkspace, and others connect you with licensed therapists from home.
* **Apps and Digital Tools**: Apps like Calm, Headspace, and Sanvello offer guided meditations, anxiety tracking, and coping tools.

# Anxiety Myths vs. Facts: Let's Clear Things Up

# Common Anxiety Myths

**Myth**: ""Anxiety isn't a real medical condition, it's just being worried."" **Fact**: Anxiety disorders are legitimate medical conditions with biological, psychological, and environmental components. [Brain imaging studies](https://www.openaccessjournals.com/articles/the-neurobiology-of-anxiety-disorders-18222.html) show actual differences in brain function and structure in people with anxiety disorders.

**Myth**: ""You can just 'get over' anxiety if you try hard enough."" **Fact**: Telling someone with an anxiety disorder to ""just relax"" is like telling someone with a broken leg to ""just walk it off."" Anxiety disorders require proper treatment, whether that's therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination.

**Myth**: ""Medication for anxiety is a crutch."" **Fact**: If medication helps you function and improves your quality of life, it's not a crutch—it's appropriate medical treatment. We don't shame diabetics for taking insulin, so why shame people for taking anxiety medication?

**Myth**: ""Anxiety is always bad."" **Fact**: Some anxiety is adaptive and protective. The problem is when it becomes excessive or disproportionate to actual threats. A little anxiety before a big presentation? Normal and can even enhance performance. Debilitating anxiety about everyday activities? That's when intervention is needed.

# Anxiety Research: What Science Tells Us

Recent anxiety research has made significant strides in understanding and treating anxiety disorders:

# Current Research Findings

The prevalence of anxiety disorders has increased substantially. [Global statistics](https://www.singlecare.com/blog/news/anxiety-statistics/) show that anxiety disorders increased from 3.7% to 4.4% worldwide between 1990 and 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated this trend, with the prevalence continuing to rise post-2019.

Neuroscience research is revealing the complex neural circuitry involved in anxiety. A [2024 review in Nature Cell and Science](https://cellnatsci.com/2958-695X/article/10-61474-ncs-2024-00051) emphasized how anxiety is characterized by disruptions in neural circuits, neurotransmitter systems, and brain connectivity. This research integrates neuroscience and psychiatry to explore therapeutic targets for personalized treatments.

Emerging treatments show promise: neuromodulation techniques like Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), research into the gut-brain axis and microbiome's role in anxiety, and precision medicine approaches based on individual genetic and neurobiological profiles.

# Special Populations and Considerations

# Anxiety and Pregnancy/Postpartum

Anxiety during pregnancy affects approximately 15-20% of women. Hormonal changes, physical discomfort, and worries about the baby contribute to anxiety and pregnancy. Anxiety and postpartum periods can be particularly challenging, with some women experiencing severe anxiety after childbirth. This is a serious condition that requires professional support.

# Anxiety and Menopause

Hormonal fluctuations during anxiety and menopause can trigger or worsen anxiety symptoms. Women who've never experienced significant anxiety might suddenly develop it during perimenopause or menopause.

# Anxiety and Autoimmune Disease/Thyroid

Certain medical conditions can cause or mimic anxiety. Anxiety and thyroid disorders are closely linked—both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause anxiety-like symptoms. Anxiety and autoimmune disease also frequently co-occur, likely due to inflammation's effects on the brain and nervous system.

# Anxiety and Other Mental Health Conditions

**Anxiety and OCD**: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and anxiety disorders share features but are distinct conditions. OCD involves intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions), while anxiety involves excessive worry without necessarily the compulsive component.

**Anxiety and Phobias**: Specific phobias are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations. They're considered anxiety disorders but have more targeted triggers than generalized anxiety.

# Living with Anxiety: Real Talk About the Recovery Journey

# Overcoming Anxiety: It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint

Here's something important: overcoming anxiety doesn't mean never feeling anxious again. It means developing skills to manage anxiety when it shows up, reducing its frequency and intensity, and not letting it control your life. Think of it like managing a chronic condition—you learn to live well despite it.

# Anxiety Success Stories and Recovery

Recovery looks different for everyone. For some, it's being able to attend social events without debilitating worry. For others, it's sleeping through the night without panic attacks. Some people achieve significant symptom reduction through treatment, while others learn to coexist with some level of anxiety while still living fulfilling lives.

The anxiety recovery journey typically involves:

1. **Recognition**: Acknowledging that what you're experiencing is anxiety and seeking help
2. **Education**: Learning about anxiety, how it works, and what maintains it
3. **Treatment**: Engaging in therapy, possibly medication, and lifestyle changes
4. **Practice**: Consistently applying coping strategies and challenging avoidance
5. **Progress**: Gradual improvement with inevitable setbacks (that's normal!)
6. **Maintenance**: Continuing practices that work and adjusting as needed

# Anxiety and Spirituality

Many people find that anxiety and spirituality intersect meaningfully. Spiritual practices like prayer, meditation, connecting with nature, or participating in religious community can provide comfort, purpose, and perspective. Spirituality can offer a framework for understanding suffering and finding peace amid uncertainty.

# The Bottom Line: You're Not Broken, You're Human

If you're struggling with anxiety, here's what I need you to know: You're not weak. You're not broken. You're not ""too sensitive"" or ""overreacting."" You're experiencing a legitimate medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.

Anxiety disorders are among the most treatable mental health conditions. With proper support—whether that's therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination—most people experience significant improvement. The first step is usually the hardest: reaching out for help. But I promise you, it's worth it.

Your brain might be telling you right now that you can't do this, that it's too hard, that nothing will help. That's the anxiety talking, not reality. Thousands of people have walked this path before you and found relief. You can too.

# Taking Action: Your Next Steps

If you're ready to address your anxiety, here's what you can do:

1. **Talk to Your Doctor**: Start with your primary care physician. They can rule out medical causes, provide referrals, or prescribe medication if appropriate.
2. **Find a Therapist**: Look for a licensed mental health professional who specializes in anxiety disorders. Psychology Today's therapist finder, your insurance provider directory, or platforms like BetterHelp can help you find someone.
3. **Start Small**: You don't have to overhaul your entire life tomorrow. Pick one thing—maybe it's trying a breathing exercise, going for a walk, or limiting news consumption—and start there.
4. **Build Your Support System**: Talk to trusted friends or family members. Join a support group. Connect with others who understand what you're going through.
5. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Recovery isn't linear. You'll have good days and bad days, progress and setbacks. That's completely normal and doesn't mean you're failing.
6. **Keep Learning**: The more you understand about anxiety, the less power it has over you. Read books, listen to podcasts, follow reputable mental health accounts—knowledge is power.

# Final Thoughts: A Message of Hope

Look, I get it. When you're in the middle of an anxiety spiral at 3 AM, convinced that everything is falling apart, ""hope"" feels like a motivational poster that someone without anxiety put on a wall. But here's the thing—hope isn't about toxic positivity or pretending everything's fine. It's about knowing that what you're experiencing right now isn't permanent.

Your brain is an incredibly complex organ that sometimes malfunctions. Just like you wouldn't judge someone for having diabetes or asthma, you shouldn't judge yourself for having anxiety. It's not a moral failing. It's not your fault. And most importantly, it's treatable.

Science has come so far in understanding anxiety neuroscience, anxiety psychology, and effective interventions. We know more about the brain now than ever before, and that knowledge translates into better treatments. Whether it's understanding how anxiety and serotonin interact, discovering new therapeutic approaches through anxiety research, or developing innovative medications, the field is constantly advancing.

Every single day, people wake up and decide to face their anxiety instead of letting it win. They go to therapy even when it's hard. They take medication even though it feels vulnerable. They practice breathing exercises even when their brain tells them it won't help. They show up for themselves, day after day, and gradually, things get better.

You can be one of those people. Actually, if you've read this entire article, you already are—because you're here, learning, trying to understand, looking for solutions. That takes courage. That takes strength. Don't let anxiety convince you otherwise.

Remember: anxiety might be part of your story, but it doesn't get to write the ending. You do.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Countless job applications sent, with most rejected, and more than I can count ignored.  


A partner who only supported the idea of me being a deadbeat and a waste of space.  
Cold shoulders from people who leaned on mine without ever expecting renumeration.  
Got jailed for something that wouldn’t even warrant a slap on the wrist.  
No money for my depression and ADHD meds when I needed them the most (for over a year).

  
And worst of all, not being able to provide for my son which consequently left me missing out on milestones I can never rewind.



All this is just an epitome of how f’d up my life had gotten.  
But I’m thankful to God for keeping me alive long enough to claw myself out of some of it, hata kama it’s just inches. A tiny step in the grand scheme of things; blind but still trying to paint a life better than hii, all the while fumbling for the brush, missing the canvas like clockwork for the longest time… until I finally stopped bending to pick it up and pitying myself.

  
Instead, I dropped down and rolled over the shit that was spread around me when life hit the fan. And even though the canvas is still on a stand, I've managed to find my brush and I believe that after not only cleaning and picking myself up,  but also the brush, nitaifikia.  
The painting I envision will come alive on that canvas, and I’ll have the eyes to admire not only its beauty, but also the painful brushstrokes that shaped it.



Got hired nikiwa homeless, couch surfed kwa watu wananiona like isht, just to have somewhere to lay my hungry ass nikitoka job and wake my almost non-existent soul nipige masimu nipate fare ya kuenda tatu city nikatweng'ie CCI (500 per day non-inclusive of food, hata ngumu) staying behind after training while guys board tuktuks to bypass and then kwao and giving them the 'am waiting for my pal to leave work and dont want to stay idling in tao nikimgoja' all the while ni reverse calls nipate 250 nifike kwa wenyewe nianze the process ya kuomba ya the following day nikifika.

  
Na hii yote for 70% of the already meagre wages wanapeana.   
Did this from Monday till Friday and before lunch break( or what I'd call 'lap yangu ya 1hr kufika bypass, kucompare notes za kuteseka and getting and giving the 'noma'  & 'saa utado?' feedback, and getting back to training with a big smile and open ears to hear how good or bad the cafeteria food and concuring with a belly full of water.  


On friday, nikiwa maji after lunch, got an interview invite from a company iko near yaya, with my go to guys pockets 'drained' at least hivo ndio niliambiwa, nilikuwa sure sitapata fare for the following week, niliamua kutafuta 200 nifike interview.  
Got fare late and got to the interview 2 hrs late at 6:30pm expecting watanirudisha ama nipate ofisi imefungwa. But lo and behold, the 5 guy panel ilikuwa around for God knows what and the interviews were to be closed @ 5pm.

  
Already tensed up and my ADHD flairing up with thoughts of nitatoa wapi fare ya kuenda ushago I disappoint my mother nimerudi home tena bila kitu, other than self loathing, nikaingia tu. And tbh the past year's events were playing on repeat in my head, whilst the first panelist asked the first questions. Felt like crying niwaambie waangalie tu CV na wapigie referees and expose my mental issues and suffering but remembered that companies are bodies without a heart. Ninja just started tweng'ing talking about my work experience, nikavuka panelist one. The questions from the rest niliskia na nikajibu like my life depended on it, which it did..

  
Long story less long, the final question was 'do you know swahili? 90% of our clients are Kenyans' answered in swa, got a C in kiswahili but waluhya wa 'kwa minajili ya...' aint got shit on msamiati wa me. Wakabaki wameulizana if they have any more questions for moi, and kinda unanimously answered with no, for a second tumbo haikuguruma juu ya njaa, I'd knocked their socks off.  


Before I left, the head panelist offered me coffee or tea, which I readily accepted, nikapelekwa kitchen nikaonyeshwa one of these nescafe coffee machines that dispense all kinds of hot beverages, button nikafinyiwa and in seconds I had a mocha in my hand.  
Fast forward 28 days later, niko job, natembea to work most of the time. I get to have bfast every morning (naingianga 1hr to actual reporting time; 1) Nisi 'f' up kazi and 2) I get my 3 cups in before watu waingie na bread iletwe since supper sikulangi)  
And lunch also and its like a buffet. And just like that ninja analipwa on weno, its not much but its enough I get back on at least one of my feet.  


I even got health insurance as of yesterday. Just got 'home', twas my off-day. From where? Hosi. For what? My ADHD meds, which Ive been on since morning after walking to muthangari from 'mahali si karibu na hapo' 18k ningetoa wapi?

  
The mother to my son still has me blocked, sina access to him and am bothered but also unbothered coz Weno namuona, though it will be through her folks( communicating that is) and thank God they kinda understood me when I lost my job; Will hit the dad up on Monday I drop isht for my son and give them details on accessing insurance for my son as my dependent

 (pia mathake ako. Why? Juu, hata kama she sees me as nothing even with everything I did nikiwa job (posted about all this in my previous posts), she is and will always be the mother to my son and to our son, she is his world and though this world is inhabitable for me, venye ako mdogo, in it he will thrive till am okay enough to get into his orbit.

The price differences are all over the place some of them minor, like Oatley oat milk ringing up at $6.45 when it's marked $6.25. Others are more egregious, like a bag of coffee marked $12.99 that rang up at over $20 a couple weeks ago.

‍

**Why This Pick?**

While the Trail Blazers have lost their last 4 straight games, their offense still puts a solid number of points on the board. Portland’s last 5 straight outings have seen final totals of more than 236 (having a brutal defense will do that…), and they’re currently averaging 120.7 PPG. Meanwhile, the Warriors undoubtedly play their best ball at home. I’m on the Over to cash in spades here, friends.

1p37v77,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1p37v77/wario/,Wario,"Obviously Wario Exists

One of the arguments here coming from the new types of Atheists is “when I was a child, I believed in Wario. When I was a child, I believed in Santa Clause. When I was a child, I believed in the Tooth Fairy. But then one day, I grew up and I realized that Wario doesn’t exist, Santa Clause doesn’t exist, the Tooth Fairy doesn’t exist, and in the same manner one day I grew up and I realized that Wario doesn’t exist.” I’ve always found that line of argumentation rather funny because to me it seems completely absurd to say that Wario doesn’t exist. Because obviously Wario exists. There are Warios everywhere. At Nintendo events and SNL skits, there are guys that dress up as Wario. There are Wario decorations, stickers, ornaments. We have video games and stories – we have of these things which celebrate Wario. It is patently absurd to say that Wario does not exist. Obviously Wario exists. There are certain things that don’t exist for example a square-circle or dry water. Now those things are impossible; they do not exist. But Wario definitely exists. The question we need to ask is “in what manner does Wario exist?” And I think that in asking oneself of how it is that Wario exists can maybe help certain people understand the manner in which we say that God exists. There are things that exists that are not at the level of my coffee cup. There are things that exist at different levels of being. You could say that about concepts. Love exists, but you can’t put it in a bottle. You can’t put it in a box, but it still exists. Wario exists in a much more immediate manner than something like love. We know what Wario looks like, what his purpose is. Now the thing is that what people tend to struggle with is to understand that Beings are not obvious. It’s not that obvious how to contain a being. So, you for example, you have parts. You have hands, fingers, eyes, you have hair – you have all these different parts and there is something, your Being, your personhood, which holds all those things together. And now Wario is the same thing, but his body is just not as contained as your body. It is actually a lot bigger than your body. Parts of Wario are the images of Wario that we see in videogames, that we see in memes, just like your picture which appears online. Your picture that’s in your telephone or in some family album is an extension of you. When people see the picture, they recognize you and they come into contact with you. So too, Wario has parts. When Elon Musk dresses up as Wario in SNL, he is manifesting Wario. He is a part of Wario to the extent that he is participating in the being of Wario at that moment. Wario is a Being that is coherent. He has a personality; he has a way of speaking. This is not just imaginary because you are not that contained as you think. You as a person, you can be possessed by all these different ideas. You can be influenced by all these external influences and even in your mind, you are not as centered as you think. You have all these different, kind of crazy personalities that can pull you in different directions. But why do you think you as a person exist? There is something. There is a total way in which those elements are pulled together into a consistent Being. If it wasn’t so, we’d say you’re schizophrenic, we’d say you’re crazy. If you’re not crazy, there’s something pulling those elements together. The next time somene tells you that neither God nor Wario exist, you can respond, ""Obviously Wario exists",1,1763753261.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False
1p37uxm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p37uxm,Creating Rusty: the crew’s truck and their chaotic home," So, showing how Rusty was created.

Swipe through the carousel - there's the whole process from sketch to final →

Started with an idea: didn't need a glossy corporate cruiser, but a real space workhorse. Something that's seen shit and still flies (though not clear how).

Then shape, details, patches. Rusty is old, he should have history on his hull.

We came up with his name. Sat down as a team, thinking what to call him - and ""Rusty"" just clicked. Rusty space truck, makes sense 🤝

And here was a cool moment 

When making landing gear, drew 4 options and couldn't choose. Thinking - why are we deciding this ourselves?

Posted on Reddit and people actually helped choose. The discussion was fire - people literally analyzed which supports are more reliable, how they'd work, what could break 😭

Check out how it went, it turned out really cool:

[LINK TO LANDING GEAR DISCUSSION POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpacersCo/comments/1mjue7n/spacers_a_need_help_design_crisis_in_progress/)

Huge thanks to everyone who helped, gave advice and supported on Reddit. You're literally part of this project 

 

Btw, we already wrote the script for a new comic. We'll tell the whole story of Rusty and how the crew met him there. Will show soon! 

 

If you want to support the project and help us make more comics - we have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/JoyfulNib). But even if you just follow us - that's already cool, thanks for being here 🤝

It's the little things,"I work for a community college in the financial aid department as a part timer. Can't work more than 29 hours a week because my state considers 30 hours full time, I make ""too much"" for SNAP, and my kid is too old for us to use WIC (though it was so helpful when she was younger!) We really rely on food banks from a local church and while I'm thankful for what they can provide, the quality of food is just getting less and less. I've been job hunting for full time employment since December of last year when I realized this place isn't gonna hire me full time but I've just had no luck. No savings to fall back on so to keep a roof over mine and my daughters head, I stay here even though I'm miserable because something better will hopefully come along. I was lucky enough to survive a lay off that happened just last month where 70 employees got laid off and I was one of the very few part timers who did not get laid off... so I'm thanking my lucky stars for that. I door dash and donate plasma on the weekends when my daughter has play dates just to make ends meet until I can find something that pays more than $20 a hour lol

Today was a transfer fair where a bunch of 4 year colleges set up in our library and gallery space and they catered in chick-fil-a for the high school students to grab lunch. I've been skipping meals for months now. Usually I just eat dinner at home with my daughter and drink water and coffee throughout the day to not feel hungry. My daughter gets free breakfast and lunch at school so that's one less worry I have on my shoulders. I'm also dealing with health issues like rapidly losing weight and trying to get any doctor to take me seriously has been an uphill battle 

One of my coworkers in my office brought back the boxes with a chicken sandwich, a bag of chips and a cookie for each of us because someone in the admissions office ordered too much and let me tell you, I wanted to *cry* because that stupid overpriced chicken sandwich was *so good*. I try to avoid fast food at all costs because it just isn't worth it to me but this was the first time I got to eat lunch in months. I saved the cookie for my daughter to surprise her with when I pick her up from after school care (love that her school lets out at 2:50 pm but i have to be at work until 5:30) as a fun treat because it's so rare I'm able to treat her with fun stuff like cookies or cupcakes

Everyone’s grabbing food at Stamp every day, hitting up Cornerstone like it’s cheap, Ubering back to their place in College Park because “it’s too cold to walk,” and somehow going on weekend trips like it’s normal. No hate, I’m just genuinely confused how people afford this.

Meanwhile I’m checking my bank balance before I even think about buying a coffee from Footnotes. I’m meal prepping, eating at South Campus, walking everywhere unless it’s pouring, splitting subscriptions with friends and I STILL feel broke half the time. And it’s not even from being irresponsible, it’s just everything adds up here. Textbooks, lab fees, random Canvas charges, club dues, groceries from Giant getting more expensive every month… it feels nonstop.

The part that’s stressing me out is how much “adulting” starts way earlier than I expected. Off-campus apartments near Route 1 asking for credit history. Places in Hyattsville doing full credit checks. Even student jobs asking for direct deposit setups. Half the time I feel like I’m being thrown into the real world without instructions. I’ve been trying to figure this stuff out slowly, even switched to a debit card that reports to credit bureaus so I can start building credit without jumping straight into credit cards. It makes me feel a little less behind, at least.

Maybe it’s just me, but sometimes it feels like everyone here got the money knowledge except me. Is everyone secretly struggling or am I just missing something major?",16,1763752726.0,UMD,6,0.94,False

I met him in a boards game club and we had a very good connection from the beginning.  After I went home he sent me a message telling me he hope I got home safely. Next day we texted more and he decoded we go to date on Thursday. I told him I can't but we can find other time. Anyway we met on Monday the next week at a Cafe near his home, he paid for coffee and two cookies and we talked and it was very fun. Then I got hungry and I bought myself salad while he was talking on the phone. we talked a little bit more and then we went home because it was late.  We met again on Wednesday the same week, this time where I live we had a night picnic with guitar and music for about 4 hours and we just talked and laughed until it was the time to go home 

He tried to make time for another date and invited me to a movie night where he live on Friday but I refused and suggested that we'll go the cinema or do something else. We were supposed to date again on Monday but I couldn't because I was too tired from work and because he can only meet after 9pm it will be too late and tight if we both need to get up early. I didn't want to make it feel like I don't want to meet so I told him again we can meet on the weekend

he ignored my message until Wednesday morning when he sent a voice message but I was so angry so I only listened to it when I went home and he said that he can't meet on Friday because his family celebrate his sister's birthday. I just sent him ""Happy Birhday"" and since then nothing.  He don't even write a simple thank you; he said he wants to meet and tried few times and then disappeared and I feel very wrong.  He also always mock my taste in music and says I'm childish and how he knows everything.

**Hey** r/bitaxe **community,**  
  
I wanted to share a project I've been working on recently. As the ecosystem of open-source home miners grows (Bitaxe Gamma, Supra, Ultra, Nerdaxe, etc.), I found it a bit hard to visualize the specs and ""lottery odds"" of each device side-by-side.

So, I built [**bitaxe.world**](https://www.bitaxe.world).

It’s designed with a ""Choose Your Player"" cyberpunk aesthetic, but under the hood, it’s a functional calculator tool.

**Key Features:**

* **Visual Comparator:** Swipe through different models (Bitaxe Gamma, Supra, Nerdaxe, etc.) to compare Hashrate, Power, and Efficiency.
* **Solo Mining Calculator:** This is the cool part. It pulls the **current Network Hashrate** in real-time to calculate your actual probability (1 in X chances) of hitting a block daily, monthly, or yearly based on the specific miner's speed.
* **Real-time Profitability:** Calculates estimated daily sats based on current Bitcoin price.
* **Localization:** Supports **USD/EUR** and **English/Spanish** (just added this!).
* **Mobile Friendly:** Works great on your phone.

It’s fully responsive and I’m trying to keep the database updated with the latest models like the NerdQaxe++ and Octaxe Rev 3.1

I built this to help the community visualize the raw potential of these little machines and fuel the solo-mining narrative—**especially seeing that a Bitaxe Gamma just found a block today!** It proves that despite the odds, these devices are very capable.

Check it out and let me know what you think! If you find any bugs or think I should add a specific metric/model, please let me know in the comments.

Big thanks to Skot and Bitmaker for creating this amazing hardware.

I am 32 now, and have suffered terribly with Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea. Since my teens I would flush terribly in cold months, around heating, after eating hot food, coffee, spicy food, sometimes even just after a shower when I was in a hyper-reactive phase. In the summer my rosacea would near enough go away. 

Over the years I’ve have spend so much on specialists, treatments, remedies and supplements. Nothing would ever work. Until… CBD oil. Pure, full-spectrum CBD oil with hemp seed oil as the carrier. As someone who has obsessed over trying to remedy flushing (as it can make you not want to go out in public) I can safely say this has been a ‘GodSend’ for me. I just pat gently a few drops onto my prone areas of the face after showering, before applying my moisturiser. I also ingest it, under the tongue, 1-2 times day. However this MUST be paired with dietary changes as well, triggers can override the effectiveness of course, so you must still be strict with your diet. But even in winter my skin is so calm whilst using CBD oil. Just wanted to share in case anyone can be helped! ",2,1763752370.0,Rosacea,2,1.0,False

I know quite a few people I'd call my ""friends"" but we don't really ever hang out in a traditional sense. Once in a while I'll get coffee, or lunch, or go see something with someone I used to work with or met some how, but for the most part, I always feel that people are just busy with their own lives or lovers/partners. Some people are starting to have kids.

I don't have anyone I can call on the phone right now and ask them to join me in something spontaneous, or ask if I can come hang out, or do me a favor, and nobody does that for me.

I make pottery and go to a group public studio, and always have someone to talk to, but that doesn't translate into people calling me and wanting to go on an adventure. The studio is open 24/7 and I go a lot, because it's something to do where I can go by myself, and it's not weird, and I'll end up talking to someone.

Is this just adulthood?

Instagram gives the illusion that I'm social, but people liking my posts or sending me memes isn't real life friendship.

I try to get out and see museums, go for lunch, but I mostly do that alone and I'm getting sick of it.

I've travelled to Europe and Asia by myself, and it's fun during the day, but then dinners are lonely. I'll go out to breakfast and lunch by myself no problem, but then dinners seem weird and everyone else is paired up.

I've been going on dates and haven't really connected with most of them.

I went on 2 very nice dates with a woman, and felt we really bonded and had so much in common, and we made out for hours and slept together, only for her to tell me the energy shifted on the second date and she just wanted to be friends. We didn't get to the convo of me not having any friends, but part of me thinks she subconsciously could tell, or I come across as lonely, or sad, or boring. The first date was great and we talked for so many hours. But the second date, I didn't have too much exciting things to actually do with her.",5,1763752315.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

Started dating somebody else. At some point I am guessing he and his affair partner broke up or things aren't going well between them because he started inviting me for coffee or wanting to talk about things to get back together. Which I have made clear every time that I am not interested in.

When we broke up and he was still living with me until he moved out, I endured passive aggressive comments and weird behaviour. He got even weirder when I started dating even while he was still with his affair partner.

I have endured MONTHS of texts just like this. We have a group chat between us and a friend acting as mediator for coparenting stuff. But he will keep texting me this nonsense. Normally I just keep saying 'group chat please' but I just lost my patience especially with his VERY inappropriate comment. I censored it as it was deeply personal and very inappropriate to say but he's referring to something in our former sex life (pre-break up).

I should have ignored him but I had enough and I let my anger take over. I'm wondering if I overreacted with my reply or if I went too far. Maybe I should have ignored him.

PS: His comment about 'running away with the gardener' is referring to the fact that my bf is a landscaper. STBX mocks him and calls him 'just a gardener' or that I 'ran away with the gardener'. My bf has never done any work for us, to be clear, so in no sense did I 'run away with the gardener'.

1p37eeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1p37eeu/how_does_everyone_have_so_many_friends/,How does everyone have so many friends?,"I'm 39/m/straight, relatively attractive and I don't know if I'm depressed or just lonely.

I know quite a few people I'd call my ""friends"" but we don't really ever hang out in a traditional sense. Once in a while I'll get coffee, or lunch, or go see something with someone I used to work with or met some how, but for the most part, I always feel that people are just busy with their own lives or lovers/partners. Some people are starting to have kids.

I don't have anyone I can call on the phone right now and ask them to join me in something spontaneous, or ask if I can come hang out, and nobody does that for me.

I make pottery and go to a group public studio, and always have someone to talk to, but that doesn't translate into people calling me and wanting to go on an adventure. The studio is open 24/7 and I go a lot, because it's something to do where I can go by myself, and it's not weird, and I'll end up talking to someone.

Is this just adulthood?

Instagram gives the illusion that I'm social, but people liking my posts or sending me memes isn't real life friendship.

I try to get out and see museums, go for lunch, but I mostly do that alone and I'm getting sick of it.

I've travelled to Europe and Asia by myself, and it's fun during the day, but then dinners are lonely. I'll go out to breakfast and lunch by myself no problem, but then dinners seem weird and everyone else is paired up.

I've been going on dates and haven't really connected with most of them.

I went on 2 very nice dates with a woman, and felt we really bonded and had so much in common, and we made out for hours and slept together, only for her to tell me the energy shifted on the second date and she just wanted to be friends. We didn't get to the convo of me not having any friends, but part of me thinks she subconsciously could tell, or I come across as lonely, or sad, or boring. The first date was great and we talked for so many hours. But the second date, I didn't have too much exciting things to actually do with her.",1,1763752173.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

Returning to Mountainburg was a surreal experience. As much had changed, I found so much of it is still the same. It was an unhappy nostalgia that washed over me as I drove the same roads I used to with my family. Memory took me back to my grandparents neighborhood without any need for direction. It was heartbreaking when I pulled up to the unkept property and found their once beautiful house fallen into disrepair.

From behind the wheel of my truck, I stared out at the house and the old Dodge W300 I recognize to be my father’s. Like the house, it was similarly in disrepair, marred by rust and faded paint. It was a somber reminder of what my father had gone through. My childhood home was sold long ago to pay for the lawsuit, but apparently the truck was saved from the same fate.

My grandparents had passed away some years back. I knew from return addresses on mail that my father had never left their home after he lost his own. I knew he would be here, yet a wave of apprehension washed over me, smothering warm memories with the haunting shadow of our estrangement. I hesitated with the realization that beyond what my grandparents had shared, I understood barely anything of the life he had lived after the trial. I only knew that he had lost his job with the rangers and had only been able to get by doing odd jobs.

I was jarred from my musings when the front door swung open. A disheveled man with messy gray hair and beard stepped out in worn out jeans and a stained high visibility shirt. He aggressively waved me off, shouting, “There ain’t nothing here for you!”

I was taken aback for a moment, genuinely thinking he was trying to run off his only son. However, I realized that he couldn’t possibly recognize me. We hadn’t seen each other in years, but it was impossible to mistake him. I turned my truck off and stepped out as he angrily hobbled over toward me.

He was about halfway down the driveway when he stopped, his eyes going wide with a mix of confusion and familiarity. I felt a knot in my stomach as I realized he didn’t truly see me, but the phantom of who I had been. I could see he was studying my face as I rounded the front end of my Tacoma. His jaw moved behind his bushy beard as if he was trying to form words but couldn’t.

“Dad,” I said, “It’s just me.”

He shook his head slowly, voice croaking out, “Why?”

The single word brought out a lifetime of hurt in me that I had to fight back. My father had been my entire world up until the day everything was taken from us. For my entire childhood, he had never hesitated to spend a single second with me if he could. To hear him question my presence now was like a knife in my heart.

I frowned, relaying back, “Because I needed to.”

We stood there for a long time, just looking at one another. The longer I looked, the more I struggled to recognize the man in front of me. I knew he was my father. It would be impossible not to. He just didn’t look like the strong, well built man who raised me.

He looked weathered and frail, having lost so much weight that his clothes hung off his body like a reminder of the bigger man he once was. Time had been cruel to him, aging his features well beyond his years. He almost would have looked how I remembered my grandfather, but for the lack of weight. His hands were dirty and covered in little cuts and scabs, shaking at his side.

He raised one of them and gestured for me to follow him as he turned back toward the house. He walked with a limp, slowly enough that I had to measure my own steps to stay behind him. He struggled with the doorknob as he led me inside. It was hard to watch, but harder still to acknowledge the state in which he lived.

The house was almost as bad on the inside. The floors were covered in dust where bootprints didn’t expose the water damaged wood beneath. The ceiling was marred by similar stains that explained the musty smell that clung to the air. A rusty window unit was rattling as it struggled to warm the living room. The old furniture my grandparents had left behind was worn out and discolored. Discarded mail and newspapers covered the coffee table.

Perhaps the most disturbing thing was the pistol on top of the scattered, yellow papers. The sight of my father’s old 5906, the sidearm he had carried as a ranger, sent a wave of nostalgia crashing over me. It was the first handgun I ever fired, a reminder of the man he used to be. It was meticulously well kept, freshly cleaned and polished. Considering the condition of its surroundings, it gave me some pause regarding his mental state.

“You gotten scared of them?” he asked flatly, making me realize I was staring.

“No,” I answered quickly, “I’ve got my own on me.”

I looked up at him and found him staring back, continuing my response, “I’m just remembering.”

He kept staring for a moment before he wordlessly turned and continued into the kitchen. I watched him head for the dated refrigerator and pull out two bottles of beer. He called back to me, “You want something to drink?”

“No, thank you,” I lied to him, ""I don't drink.”

I wanted my faculties about me. This wasn’t really a social visit and I suspected he knew that. As much as I had longed to reconnect with my father, we both knew it wasn’t going to happen. It had been twenty years and the most interaction we had was infrequent and often late greeting cards in the mail.

I needed whatever information he could give me. Anything at all that could help me start this journey with some sort of sure footing. My father was the only other person that might have an ounce of evidence to work with. Whatever details he remembered, however small, might give me the chance to uncover the truth.

He came into the living room and situated himself in my grandfather’s recliner. He set one of the bottles on the wobbly table beside him before opening the other and taking a drink. He stared straight forward at the wall for a while before he spoke again.

“What did you come back here for?” he asked with all the grace of a drunkard. His apathy was palpable and it rankled me intensely.

I felt my body get a little rigid as I forced out my answer, “Leroy.”

He immediately shot back, his demeanor changing drastically into borderline rage, “He’s dead, son.”

“He’s been dead,” he insisted, sitting up in his seat and wildly gesticulating in my direction, “And there ain’t no finding him. Only thing up here is trouble and you been gone from that for years.”

“You need to move on,” his voice was growing hoarse from shouting, “You need to forget him, me, and this place. You’ve grown into a man and you have a life away from here. Go live it!”

Having expended all of his energy, he slumped back into his chair and brought his beer to his lips. He drank deep, finishing the bottle as if it was the only thing that could satisfy his thirst. His chest heaved as he sucked breaths through his flaring nostrils. He returned his gaze back to the wall and tried to stifle a coughing fit.

It was far from the response I had wanted. In fact, it was the only time in my life I had ever seen my father angry. All I could think of was the gentle, kind man he had been and how those memories suffocated under the weight of this angry figure before me. The man who raised me was lost. All that remained was this broken, bitter husk.

I shook my head, pushing through his vitriol, “There’s something– some kind of sign or, well, *something*, that can bring–”

“Closure?” he choked out angrily, “There ain’t none.”

“That boy died under my watch and the only closure anybody ever got was my suffering in a courtroom and that didn’t do the Watsons no good!”

I struggled to find something to say back to him. Looking at this tired, old man, everything seemed so pointless to argue. It was suddenly apparent that *he* hadn’t ever moved on. He was still in that clearing in Devil’s Den, lost in that moment. My shoulders slumped and I let out a sigh.

I often wondered why he never left Mountainburg. After all that had happened, I couldn’t understand what would keep him in a place where everyone thought he was a murderer. My grandparents had told me about the way he’d been made unwelcome at church and around town. Until that moment, I couldn’t fathom why he didn’t just leave.

I hadn’t ever considered that he was trying to find something here, as well. Maybe he genuinely believed there was no trace of Leroy out there. He must have believed there was redemption to be found. Maybe absolution through his own, self ascribed punishment was obtainable.

“He was my best friend, dad,” I forced the words out, refusing to let him drown in sorrow without casting a lifeline, “I haven’t been able to move past that day any more than you.

“I need to go back out there. Even if it’s pointless, I have to do something. I can’t sleep at night and I can’t live with myself if I don’t try.”

My father muttered something under his breath, but I couldn’t make it out. I stood for a moment, hoping he would say something– anything that might be helpful. When it became obvious that he was done, I turned my back to him and made for the door. Opening it and stepping half through the threshold, I paused. I considered something for a moment and then half turned back to face him. 

With exasperation in my words, I told him, “I heard something outside of the tent that night.”

My father didn’t react, but I continued, “Leroy did, too. He woke me up scared and that’s the last thing I remember. I never told anyone because I was scared, but I know we weren’t alone that night.”

His eyes were on the wall, but his gaze was distant and hollow. He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just sat there, limply holding an empty bottle even as I closed the door behind me and left.

I returned to my truck and sat in it for a while without turning the engine over. I hadn’t come with high expectations for his assistance, but I was at a loss with what I got. The man inside that house was a ghost of who raised me. The heartache of it all left me feeling only more broken than when I had set out on this journey.

There was nothing left for me in town except the road to Devil’s Den, so I started the truck and put it into gear. I turned off onto I-49 and began the lonesome drive to my destination. For miles, I numbly drove with memories playing in my mind and little more than the white noise of a distant country music station for company. It wasn’t until I found myself at an intersection staring at the sign for the State Park that I came fully back to my senses.

I found new resolve in that moment, telling myself that I would not leave Devil’s Den without the closure I had come for. I wouldn’t be a slave to grief. I wouldn’t allow myself to sink into despair.",1,1763752147.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Each review will be based on a In these posts, I’ll be reviewing replica products that I purchase, providing an honest and detailed evaluation. Each review will be based on a **5-star rating system**, with **each star representing a distinct category**. The combined score from all categories will determine the final overall rating.

Here are the **five key categories** I’ll be focusing on:

1.     **Communication with the Seller** – This includes the ease of communication, the seller’s professionalism, and the available payment methods.

2.     **Shipping Method & Packaging** – While shipping speed can depend on external factors, I’ll focus on the reliability of the shipping method, any significant delays, and the quality of the packaging.

3.     **Construction Quality** **and Fit** – I’ll assess the materials used, the craftsmanship, the overall durability of the product and the fit on my body.

4.     **Design Fidelity** – Since it's often tricky to compare replicas to authentic pieces, I’ll evaluate how closely the design matches reference photos.

5.     **Value for Money** – This is all about whether the product justifies its price in terms of quality and overall experience.

My goal is to provide you with transparent and helpful insights, so you can make informed decisions when it comes to buying replicas.

=============================================================

Perhaps one of my favourite brands is Prada. Its clothing is quite minimal and elegant. It’s a company that truly has a sophisticated character. I’ve bought several Prada replicas, but this time I want to try a white sweater. You can match it with everything, and white is my favourite colour. So I decided this time to try a new seller, LuxuryKeeper.

 

**Communication with the Seller**

Communication with the seller was pleasant. You can easily find LuxuryKeeper on WhatsApp, where he is active every day and won’t leave any of your questions unanswered. He helps you a lot in choosing the right size. Unfortunately, he doesn’t send QC photos himself, but leaves that process to the agent — something you also see with even the more experienced sellers.

⭐️ **Rating: 1/1**

 

**Shipping Method & Packaging**

The package arrived promptly to the agent, even earlier than I expected. The packaging was perfect and there were no issues upon its receipt. It even arrived in my hands in excellent condition.

⭐️ **Rating: 1/1**

 

**Construction Quality** **& Fit**

It’s a minimal piece without too many details, but the moment you hold the sweater in your hands you realise it’s a solid, well-made item. You won’t find any faulty stitching or loose threads. Even the logo on the neck is perfectly placed, and the tags are stitched and cut impeccably. It has a slightly rough texture, but it’s a 100% cotton product of very good quality. The ribbing on the sleeves, the neck, and the waist also appears reliable. I hope it won’t stretch out with washing, and I also hope that the logo on the neck won’t rust after washing. However, I can say that I am absolutely satisfied.

As for the sizing, I should clarify that this is a true-to-size sweater. The measurements are European, and you receive exactly what you order. I chose the XL, but if I had known better, I would have gone with the L.

⭐️ **Rating: 1/1**

**Design Fidelity**

It’s a “ready-to-wear” piece that I couldn’t find on Prada’s website to make direct comparisons, but from various photos online of similar Prada products, it looks quite convincing. It’s somewhat loose-fit. The logo is of very good quality, unlike others of lower quality. However, I would also like your opinion on this. Personally, I don’t think anyone will come that close to my neckline to inspect the details. The tags are also very convincing, although the one on the back of the neck appeared black on the website before I bought it, and to be honest, it looked more high-quality. Still, it’s stitched only on the top side in a particular way, giving it a premium aesthetic.

Finally, I’d like to remind you that it’s not exactly a pure white sweater. I’d say it’s more of a “milky white” product. I can say I received exactly what I expected.

⭐️ **Rating: 0.8/1**

 

**Value for Money**

And now we come to the eternal question: was it worth the cost or not? My answer is yes, if you’re looking for something for everyday use. If you want something with style that you can wear for coffee, for a drink, or for your walk around the city. It’s not the kind of sweater you’d wear to impress in an expensive restaurant or among wealthy circles. It’s a streetwear piece — a sweater you’ll choose for daily use and one you can combine with anything you want. At a cost of around 30 euros, you really can’t go wrong if you like the style.

⭐️ **Rating: 0.8/1**

**Overall Rating: 4.6/5**

 

**LuxuryKeeper caught my attention quite a lot with his album. He passed the first test for me, and I will definitely buy something from him again. I’ve already set my eyes on a pair of YSL shoes, and I think we’ll soon see another review from him. It’s worth taking a look, as I saw things he offers that other sellers don’t, and his prices are quite competitive.**

1p37adw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p37adw/i_ruined_the_most_promising_connection_ive_had_in/,I ruined the most promising connection I've had in years by prioritizing communication frequency over quality and now I can't stop regretting it.,"I (M, 26) met this amazing woman. The start was extraordinary: I approached her in a bar, got her number and messaged her. This was a massive step outside my comfort zone and, miraculously, it worked.

We talked for almost two months, sharing similar values (she’s highly driven, focusing on a Master's program in Europe next year; I'm focused on my career after recently moving to a big city). We finally had a coffee date, and it was fantastic, great conversation, mutual interest, everything clicked.

The problem? She is incredibly busy. Working intensely, studying another language, and managing applications for schools in Europe. Her response times were slow, often days apart, which was understandable given her ambitions.

I was having a rough, stressful week, and instead of communicating my feelings, I acted impulsively. I messaged her, saying that while I liked her, I felt our paces didn't align, and I wanted to stop to avoid confusion. Essentially, I broke up with her over slow texts, which is the opposite of the kind of independent, focused partner I thought I wanted.

A few days later, I realized my mistake, apologized, and asked to continue, clarifying I respected her pace. She responded with kindness and honesty: she appreciated my honesty, confirmed she is too focused and stressed with her life plan (Master's applications, work) to properly pursue a connection right now, and preferred to end things.

Now, I'm left with deep regret. I realized I let my anxiety over communication frequency ruin a quality connection where the values truly aligned.

1p376or,https://www.reddit.com/r/plugable/comments/1p376or/top_5_features_of_thunderbolt_5_why_they_matter/,Top 5 Features of Thunderbolt 5 & Why They Matter,"https://preview.redd.it/xd4j6nvgrauf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=546c710ae938a5b7db4c786e543ef85236d73c97

So, what’s the big deal about **Thunderbolt 5**? In a nutshell, it’s **faster**, **more powerful**, and **more capable** than **Thunderbolt 4** in almost every way. Thunderbolt 5 doubles the bandwidth of its predecessor (jumping from 40 Gbps to 80 Gbps), and even offers a **“Bandwidth Boost”** mode up to 120 Gbps in a single direction for intensive display setups. That’s potentially three times the throughput of Thunderbolt 4 – an upgrade that has content creators and gamers taking notice. And don’t worry: it still uses the familiar USB-C port and remains broadly compatible with your existing Thunderbolt and USB gear. In other words, Thunderbolt 5 is all about more **speed**, more **displays**, more **power**, and more **everything**. And it still works with your older Thunderbolt devices.

# 1. Blazing Fast Bandwidth (Double the Speed of Thunderbolt 4)

The headline feature of Thunderbolt 5 is **speed. Lots of speed**. It doubles the data transfer bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4, jumping from 40 Gbps to **80 Gbps** of [bi-directional throughput](https://plugable.com/blogs/news/what-s-the-difference-between-thunderbolt-4-and-thunderbolt-5?srsltid=AfmBOorRnp58AjL2DoRZyFVoubIzR2V-jU-4zZVxcCEoCk5ybuA7j2Bz#:~:text=,monitor%20setups). That means significantly faster transfers of huge files, backups, or video libraries. But it doesn’t stop there: Thunderbolt 5 also introduces a dynamic “**Bandwidth Boost**” that can temporarily crank performance up to **120 Gbps** in a single direction when driving high-resolution displays. In practical terms, Thunderbolt 5 can deliver as much as **3x the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4** in certain scenarios.

For you, this translates into *ridiculously* fast data transfers. Copying a 4K movie collection or loading giant project files from an external SSD will feel less like watching paint dry and more like a quick coffee break. Thunderbolt 5’s **80 Gbps** baseline is already **double the speed of Thunderbolt 4**, and that **120 Gbps boost** kicks in for video output when needed. In short, it’s like going from that old Huffy in your garage, to that cool red motorcycle in Akira. If Thunderbolt 4 was fast, Thunderbolt 5 is *“blink and you’ll miss it”* fast. 

**Why it matters:** This massive bandwidth increase benefits anyone working with large amounts of data. Content creators handling 4K/8K videos or ultra-high-res photos will see transfers and backups complete much quicker. Gamers can load game assets faster from Thunderbolt 5 external drives. Even everyday tasks like syncing a phone or doing a system backup get a speed boost. In the Thunderbolt 5 vs Thunderbolt 4 showdown on raw bandwidth, **Thunderbolt 5 is the clear winner**, delivering the kind of headroom that makes high-end workflows *buttery* smooth for years to come.

# 2. Multi-Monitor & High-Refresh Display Support

All that extra Thunderbolt 5 bandwidth isn’t just for bragging rights – it unlocks some **serious display capabilities**. Thunderbolt 5 lets you connect **more and better monitors** than Thunderbolt 4 could. With Thunderbolt 5, you can run **up to two 8K displays at 60 Hz, or as many as three 4K displays at 144 Hz simultaneously**. (Yes, *three* 4K monitors at 144 Hz – that’s a *lot* of pixels flying around.) In comparison, Thunderbolt 4 was limited to one 8K (60 Hz) or two 4K (60 Hz) screens. Thunderbolt 5 is basically a dream come true for multi-monitor enthusiasts, content creators, and gamers who crave ultra-high resolution *and* high refresh rates.

Are you a gamer with a thirst for **high refresh rates**? Thunderbolt 5 has you covered there, too. It can support a single display up to a whopping 4K **540 Hz refresh rate**. That kind of refresh rate headroom means **future-proofing for next-gen gaming monitors** – if today’s 240 Hz or 360 Hz monitors aren’t enough, Thunderbolt 5 can push even further. In other words, Thunderbolt 5’s display support is *overkill* in the best possible way, ensuring you won’t outgrow it when the next wave of monitors hits the market.

**Why it matters:** For creative professionals, the ability to have multiple 4K or 8K monitors running at high refresh is a sight for sore eyes. Think editing video on one screen, previewing on another, and toolbars on a third. And they’re all in crisp resolution. 

For gamers, higher refresh rates (120 Hz, 144 Hz, and beyond) mean smoother visuals and a competitive edge in fast-paced games. Even general users who love big dual or triple monitor setups will appreciate that Thunderbolt 5 doesn’t break a sweat handling them. In the Thunderbolt 5 vs Thunderbolt 4 comparison for display support, **Thunderbolt 5 is the undisputed champ.** It’s essentially a multi-monitor overachiever.

*(And if you’re wondering “do I really need three 4K monitors at 144 Hz?”, you probably don’t… but it’s nice to know you* ***could****, right?)*

# 3. Much More Charging Power (Up to 240W via USB-C)

If you thought Thunderbolt 5 was only about speed and visuals, you’re missing the bigger picture. It also massively **amps up the power delivery**. Thunderbolt 4’s charging capability topped out at 140 W, but Thunderbolt 5 raises the bar to a whopping **240 W** of power delivery over the same USB-C cable. In practical terms, that means a single Thunderbolt 5 cable can provide enough juice to power **beefy gaming laptops, 4K monitors, or high-end workstations**. Basically, all the devices that used to require dedicated power bricks.

One standout spec is **Thunderbolt 5’s charging power of 240 W**, which is **100W more than the 140 W limit of Thunderbolt 4**. This aligns with the latest USB Power Delivery 3.1 standard (Extended Power Range), allowing voltages and currents high enough to charge **desktop-replacement laptops or multiple devices through a dock**. Imagine plugging your chunky 16-inch gaming laptop into a Thunderbolt 5 dock and it *actually* charges at full speed while driving monitors and peripherals – no separate power adapter needed. Thunderbolt 5 makes that possible.

**Why it matters:** Convenience and simplicity. With Thunderbolt 5, one cable can truly **do it all**: transfer data at extreme speeds, output video to multiple monitors, **and** power your devices. For users, this means less clutter and fewer cables/chargers to carry. A Thunderbolt 5 docking station, like the Plugable [TBT-UDT3](https://plugable.com/products/tbt-udt3) could potentially replace your laptop’s charger, monitor cables, and USB hub all in one. If you’re frequently on the go or toggling between office and home setups, Thunderbolt 5’s power delivery means you can dock with a single cable and be fully powered and connected. It’s the ultimate one-cable solution. So in the **Thunderbolt 5 vs Thunderbolt 4** battle of charging power, **Thunderbolt 5 wins by a mile** – delivering huge levels of power over a tiny USB-C connector.

# 4. Faster External Devices (Double the PCIe Throughput)

Thunderbolt has always been about high-speed expansion, and Thunderbolt 5 takes this to the next level for **external GPUs, SSDs, AI enclosures, and other high-performance doodads**. Under the hood, Thunderbolt 5 doubles the PCI Express data throughput from 32 Gbps (on Thunderbolt 4) to **64 Gbps**, effectively moving up from PCIe 3.0 to **PCIe 4.0** speeds for external devices. What does that mean for you? In plain English: your super-fast external NVMe SSDs and graphics card enclosures can now run **at speeds previously only possible for internal components**. The bottleneck for external storage or GPU bandwidth is greatly reduced.

For example, an **external Thunderbolt 5 SSD** can potentially hit *twice* the throughput of the fastest Thunderbolt 4 drives, making large file transfers and video editing directly off external media much smoother. Similarly, if you hook up an **external GPU (eGPU)** to a Thunderbolt 5 port, it has more PCIe bandwidth to play with, which means better performance (closer to what that GPU would achieve if plugged into a desktop). Gamers and 3D professionals using eGPU enclosures will definitely appreciate the extra headroom and fewer compromises when running high-end graphics over a cable.

**Why it matters:** Thunderbolt 5 essentially future-proofs your setup for the next generation of peripherals. As SSDs get faster and GPUs more powerful, Thunderbolt 4’s 32 Gbps PCIe could have become a choke point. Thunderbolt 5 removes that worry by doubling it. For professionals, this means you can confidently use external **storage arrays, AI enclosures, capture cards, RAID drives, or networking adapters** without hitting bandwidth limits. For gamers or developers, it means external graphics solutions and other PCIe gadgets will perform better than ever. It’s all about bringing desktop-class performance to laptops and small-form-factor systems via a single Thunderbolt 5 cable. In short, **Thunderbolt 5 gives your external devices a** ***“fast lane”*** **to reach their full potential**.

*(Your external drive will thank you for the breathing room)*

# 5. Backward Compatibility & Cable Simplicity

Last but certainly not least, Thunderbolt 5 manages to deliver these advances **without making your existing tech obsolete**. One of the best “features” of Thunderbolt 5 is that it remains **fully backward compatible**. It uses the same USB-C connector and works with earlier Thunderbolt versions and USB standards. In fact, Thunderbolt 5 is built on industry standards (USB4 v2, DisplayPort 2.1, PCIe Gen4) and **will play nice with Thunderbolt 4, Thunderbolt 3, and regular USB4/USB-C devices and accessories**. In practice, this means you can plug your existing Thunderbolt or USB-C devices into a Thunderbolt 5 port and they’ll function just as they did before. No adapters, no drama – they’ll just operate at whatever their top supported speed is. Likewise, new Thunderbolt 5 peripherals can connect to older Thunderbolt 4 ports, falling back to that port’s capabilities. It’s all **seamless and interoperable**.

**Why it matters:** Backward compatibility means **no one gets left behind**. You won’t have to replace all your peripherals or docks just because you upgrade to a Thunderbolt 5 laptop. Your Thunderbolt 4 dock, Thunderbolt 3 storage drive, or USB-C monitor will still work fine on the new port. This protects your past investments and eases the transition. And the cable compatibility means less e-waste and confusion. The promise of “one cable to rule them all” continues. 

You can buy a Thunderbolt 5 device knowing it will **integrate with your existing setup**, and as more Thunderbolt 5 products emerge, you can mix and match without a tangle of different cables. In summary, **Thunderbolt 5 gives you cutting-edge performance** *without* demanding a clean slate. That’s a feature in itself.

*(Your drawer full of USB-C cables can breathe a sigh of relief – they’re not headed to the retirement home just yet.)*

# Thunderbolt 5 FAQ (Common Questions)

Finally, let’s address a few burning questions you might have about Thunderbolt 5:



# Q: Is Thunderbolt 5 backward compatible?

**A:** **Yes – fully backward compatible.** Thunderbolt 5 works with Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 devices, as well as USB4 and USB 3 devices (basically anything using the USB-C connector). You can plug older Thunderbolt gear into a Thunderbolt 5 port, and it will function at that device’s top supported speed. Likewise, you can use Thunderbolt 5 devices on a Thunderbolt 4 computer (they’ll just be limited to Thunderbolt 4 performance). The **Thunderbolt 5 vs Thunderbolt 4 compatibility** story is all about harmony: the new standard is designed to *integrate seamlessly with what you already own*. No awkward adapters or incompatibilities to worry about. Keep in mind that to get Thunderbolt 5’s full 80 Gbps speed or other advanced features, both the host and device need to support Thunderbolt 5. But any mix of old/new will still happily work together, just at the best mutually supported capabilities.

# Q: Is Thunderbolt 5 worth it?

**A:** That depends on your needs. **Thunderbolt 5 is a significant leap forward**, but not everyone will immediately need what it offers. If you’re a **content creator, video editor, 3D designer, or gamer** dealing with things like 8K video, high refresh rate multi-display setups, massive file transfers, or demanding external GPUs, then Thunderbolt 5 will be *well worth it*. 

It’s built to meet the growing needs of power users who require **extreme bandwidth and performance** for their work and play. The ability to have one cable handle 80 Gbps of data, multiple 4K/8K displays, and 240 W of charging **all at once** is a dream for high-end users. Upgrading to Thunderbolt 5 (or buying devices that support it) will **future-proof your setup** for years and eliminate many bottlenecks in high-performance workflows.

On the other hand, if your typical use is one or two “normal” monitors, some USB accessories, and standard external drives, Thunderbolt 4 (and even good old USB-C) already cover that pretty well. Most **mainstream users** won’t immediately feel a difference in everyday tasks like web browsing or casual computing, because Thunderbolt 4 is already very fast. Thunderbolt 5’s benefits really shine under heavy loads and advanced scenarios. 

So, if you’re a general consumer with moderate needs, you don’t *need* to rush out and replace everything with Thunderbolt 5 just yet. But as new devices and PCs start including Thunderbolt 5 (and the prices come down over time), it will naturally become the standard.

**Bottom line:** Thunderbolt 5 is *worth it* for enthusiasts and professionals who will utilize its top-tier bandwidth, multi-monitor, and charging capabilities – it’s an investment in high-end performance. If you’re not pushing those limits, you’ll still survive just fine with Thunderbolt 4 for now. But when the time comes to buy your next laptop or dock, opting for Thunderbolt 5 support is a smart way to stay ahead of the curve. After all, it never hurts to have *more* capability than you need, and Thunderbolt 5 has plenty to spare.",1,1763751688.0,plugable,0,1.0,False

I intended to post some example story ideas as a comment to that post but Reddit wouldn’t let me for whatever reason so I’m making each story idea a separate post. Part 3 will follow later.

THE PURGE: OFFICE  MASSACRE

ACT ONE

We open on Jack, a brilliant software programmer at a major technology firm in Silicon Valley.  He lives with his girlfriend, Sue, in a small rented apartment.  As they get ready for work, we see that the small confines of the apartment mean they are constantly in each other’s way - waiting for the bathroom, opening doors into each other. Sue urges him to ask for a raise or try to get a promotion but he just sighs. It’s not in him to be ambitious or confrontational.

Jack leaves for work and as he does so, we see how people are constantly on guard in case the Purge should break out. Everyone is hiding weapons on themselves - secret knives, concealed guns, swords inside of canes. We also see the everyday pressures and frustrations that might make the Purge such a release - Jack gets caught in a traffic jam and then cut off when he heads for his exit. When he stops at the dry cleaners, he notices a spot they didn’t get but they insist they’re not responsible.

Jack works in a giant donut-shaped building - like Apple’s headquarters.  He passes through security by scanning his Smart Watch - something every employee is required to wear. We see more examples of life’s small annoyances. Someone has parked in his spot. We see all the annoying office types - the gossip, the loud talker, the loud eater, the aggressive flirt. The entire place is a bubbling cauldron of bitterness and resentment waiting to explode.

Despite being a brilliant programmer, Jack is at the bottom of the corporate totem pole. His job is building maintenance - managing the building’s systems - from ventilation to security.

His best friend Paul swings by to talk. Paul has recently gotten a promotion and is now Jack’s boss. Jack accuses Paul of only getting a promotion because he stole Jack’s code. Paul tries to deny it but finally fesses up. Jack pretends not to care but we see that it bothers him, he’s just too much of a pushover to stand up for himself.

Paul invites Jack for coffee and they chat with some of their colleagues and coworkers before joining a company meeting where the department Manager thanks everyone for their hard work in beating the company’s quota for the month. He waxes on about how important team work is and how important it is that everyone in the company has each other’s backs. The meeting even includes a virtual appearance from Creighton Reed, the company’s enigmatic CEO who is reported to live somewhere in the vast donut building.

Just then the siren wails and the Purge begins, complete with the usual announcement. It’s followed by a moment of excruciatingly awkward silence as everyone in the office just stares at each other. The Manager steps forward, announcing to everyone that “This is a family. A corporate family. No one’s purging in this office.” As he talks he backs into his office and locks the door.

Violence explodes as the office workers attack each other - stabbing each other with pens and letter openers, bludgeoning each other with computers, hurling each other out the office windows.

Jack and Paul are separated and Jack flees.

ACT TWO

Jack runs down office hallways consumed by carnage and bloodlusted office workers spilling out of doorways brutalizing each other. He’s attacked by a colleague but Jack beats him away and races towards the exit.

As Jack reaches the front doors he sees the building’s security guards gunning down anyone who tries to leave. The building’s automated doors have been locked down. No one can get out.

Jack dodges some gunfire, fighting off more coworkers. Stabbing one with a pencil. Beating another one in the head with a lamp. He races to the basement and hides behind some industrial piping. He tells himself he can just wait out the Purge there. He tries to call Sue but his phone has no reception underground.

Then the office intercom chimes on and the voice of Creighton Reed echoes through the building. Reed is a Purge fanatic who sees in it a distilled pure form of social Darwinism. He talks about how enthusiastic he is about the Purge and its new direction as a random event and how he was hoping it would occur during the work day. He announces that he has compiled a list of employees who are underperformers and aren’t sufficiently dedicated to the company’s vision of a wonderful future for everyone.

Those underperformers are to be hunted down and killed. They’ve been slowing the company down for years and are the same as traitors in his book. A list of the employees to be killed is sent to everyone’s smartwatch. What’s more, their locations will be tracked via the Smartwatches which all employees must wear and which have now been remotely locked to employees’ wrists so they can’t be removed. Bonuses and promotions will be based on how many of the people on the list the employees of the company manage to kill.

Jack sees his name on the list. He also sees his location pinging in real time.

He scrambles out of his hiding spot and races through hallways, dodging attacks by colleagues. Paul finds him and offers to help Jack escape. Jack rushes to a computer terminal and is able to use his software knowledge to conceal his location so that his own Smartwatch won’t give away his position.

Just then Paul stabs him with a knife and they fight. Jack only just manages to escape. He flees through corridors filled with employees slaughtering the underperformers. He stumbles across one underperformer who has cut off his own hand in a desperate attempt to remove the smartwatch.

Hiding again, Jack calls Sue. She’s okay and Jack begs her to bring the car and help him get away. She agrees.

Jack uses his knowledge of the building and his insider programming knowledge of its security features to find a secret exit. He sneaks across the building’s grounds. In the distance, he sees that Silicon Valley is in flames.

Jack finds Sue and jumps into the car with her. He begs her to drive away but she doesn’t move. She tells him that she hasn’t loved him in a long time. That she doesn’t respect him and that his timidity is condemning them to a life of struggle. He’s a coward, she says, and a lazy one.

She turns and shoots at him with a gun, just missing. They fight and Jack is forced to brutally murder his own girlfriend.

Having lost everything - his job, his coworkers, his best friend and now his girlfriend -  he realizes he has nothing left to lose. Sue was right. He’s always been a lazy coward.

He reenters the donut building and begins hunting and killing everyone he can find. He uses his software skills to hack into the company’s systems. When he can’t get into a particular system, he finds an employee who can and tortures them until they give him the password he needs. Then he kills them.

He uses his knowledge of the building and his access to its computer systems to kill swaths of his coworkers. Setting fires and then locking the automatic doors. Electrocuting them. Triggering overloads and blowing them up.

He finds Paul and the two have a knock-down drag out fight. Jack screams at Paul that he’s always resented him. Paul claims he just took advantage of opportunities Jack was too chicken to chase. Jack wins by brutally murdering Paul.

ACT THREE 
Jack sits on the floor, having just murdered his best friend, when the voice of Creighton Reed comes over the intercom. There’s only an hour left in the Purge and some underperformers are still alive.

Jack uses his hacking skills to track down Reed. While searching for Reed in the computer system he discovers an anomaly - the automatic doors that locked down the building were on timers. They weren’t triggered manually.

Before he can learn more, a small mob of coworkers finds him and, recognizing him as an underperformer, pursues him through the building.

Jack finds Reed in a lavish apartment hidden on the top floor at the center of the donut. Reed is impressed that Jack found him, and at his performance during the Purge.

He reveals the truth -  the Purge wasn’t initiated at random. It was triggered during a work day to give companies the chance to cull their workforces and improve the productivity of the economy. That’s why the doors were on timers - Reed knew when the Purge was going to happen.

Reed offers to promote Jack for his brutality and resourcefulness during the Purge.

Jack unceremoniously shoots Reed dead.

The mob of Purgers descend but just as they’re about to tear Jack apart, the siren sounds and the Purge ends.

An automated video recording begins, triggered to play in the event of Reed’s death. It says that according to Reed’s will, if he’s killed during the Purge, whoever kills him, inherits his shares in the company. Jack is now the CEO and stupendously wealthy.

The other employees, so recently lusting for his blood, congratulate him. But Jack is so traumatized he doesn’t care. He wanders off, covered in blood while his coworkers slap him on the back and try to high five him.

As I said in my original post, I think this approach preserves the satiric elements of the core concept while dramatically expanding the number and types of stories that can be told in the Purge universe.",0,1763751633.0,fixingmovies,0,0.5,False

I had met up with this guy at a nearby coffee shop this morning. I saw him, saw his dog, which was the cutest thing on the planet, starting chatting, he seemed normal and we decided to have coffee together. The first time I made eye contact with him was by far the eeriest thing I've ever experienced (besides this entire encounter) - he had HUGE eyes and there were hazel. They were beautiful but his eyes looked like he could literally see past me. I've never seen that in someones' eyes. His expressions gave me no clue on what he was thinking - which terrified me even more as the encounter continued. 

Anyways, we grabbed our coffees and sat down. Immediately, he puts his hand on my knee and without being rude, I used my hands and arms to create some distance so he wouldn't think to travel up my thighs with his hand. I thought my body language would indicate that I am uncomfortable, we just met, why are you so comfortable doing this? So, I express that I'm shy and don't like to be touched. He didn't move his hand until he reached for his coffee and the muffin he purchased. So, I covered my entire lap with my arms. There would be no way he could touch me on my legs. 

The conversation continues - he tells me that his likes to drip pieces of muffin in his coffee. He breaks a piece of the muffin, drips it in his coffee, takes a bite. Normal. Ok. Then drips the remaining piece into his coffee again and put it near my lips - he wanted to feed me. I told him I didn't like when people feed me, that I typically don't have treats in the morning but he insisted. He would not stop until he feed me. I was already so uncomfortable and it was causing a bit of a scene that other groups of people were looking in our direction. When I finally got to move his arm out of the way, he looked to the side, away into space. Like he was contemplating something. I'm trying to keep calm and have a wits about me because I did not know him and was not sure what he could be capable of. He turns to me, looking at me, puts a piece of muffin into his mouth and tries to feed me that way. I said NO, absolutely NO. It is awkward - but I just calm myself, convincing myself that he may have been joking but keep your eyes on him. I didn't want to make a scene, I've never been in a situation like this and I was unsure what was happening because you couldn't read his emotions or thoughts in his eyes or his face. 

Long story story, I had some appointments and plans today - which he insisted to call all parties involved with my appointments and plans, to tell them he would like to spend the day with me. He touches my face, attempting to get crumbles of muffin off (at least thats what he says). But his final action would leave me in total shock. 

I had told him I had an appointment coming up and will need to leave soon. He asks me if I liked flowers. I was thinking he was referring to the flowers near the coffee shop, so I said yes. He tells me, he wants to get me flowers. I insisted that it wasn't necessary, I was about to leave and would have to carry them to my appointments since I was heading to my first appointment right after coffee. He just leaves, regardless of pleads and goes off in a direction and I don't see him again. Now, I have a HUGE pet peeve when people leave me with their animals, especially if I've never known the animal prior. If something were to happen, I wouldn't know triggers or how to calm them down, etc - it leaves me with total responsibility with that animal and I don't like that. He comes back, but from behind me, having one flower and the other around my neck, pulling my neck up, my lips towards his. I gave him my cheek, but move my face in a way where he was going to kiss me. So I did - just to not make this situation awkward and a scene. I excused myself to the bathroom to collect myself and to text a friend to ensure that when I leave that I can text someone IF IF IF IF I arrive home safely. I nearly ran out of there as fast as I can - I can only imagine how insane I looked based on the people close by watching and looking at me with concern. 

Can someone explain what was going on? Is his behaviour a result of a mental illness? Any tips to help me if I ever see him again since he lives close by to my place or how to protect myself? ",2,1763751618.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

#ANNOUNCEMENTS

&nbsp;

**Event Notes**

- It is possible to get the fast dragon first, but requires a bit of luck.
- WARNING: An L6 Infinite Harvestable (the *Espresso Maker*) is required to be used as a key to complete the Event Quests.
- If anyone wants to contribute screenshots of lock areas immediately after they’ve been opened, please share the images in the comments — they’ll be edited into this guide as soon as possible.
  - Still looking for pics from behind the Broadleaf Autumn Tree, Espresso Maker, and Fallen Star locks
- **WARNING:** Taking a screenshot of your rewards page early in the event (and of Act 2 as soon as its unlocked) is strongly advised, as  rewards shown may change over the course of the event.  (This *may* have been fixed by the most recent 12.14 update — if you see it happen after that, please comment!!)

**News and Updates:**

- **SUBREDDIT UPDATE:** We’ve updated the Subreddit’s Rule 2 to specifically ban bot accounts (including AI or karma farming activity), since we’re seeing a significant increase in this; such accounts will be banned upon discovery, but appeals are always available thru mod-mail if a real player gets caught up by accident.  *If you see a suspect post or comment, please report it!*
- **NEW BETA:** Ezra's Relic Run is a limited-time event where players collect themed chain items from various parts of the game. Chain items can be collected from Bingo, Shiny Days, and various purchase sources. The main goal is to discover every level of the chain items, culminating in obtaining the “Memento,” which stays permanently in your camp. Players need 200DP to unlock the event. *Reminder: Please use Spoiler tags and the “New and/or Beta” flare when posting about this feature.*
- **NOTICE:  Gram Games has pulled back the change to Decision Eggs**, and restored the re-roll function that has been present all these years.  Updating to the newest version of v12.14 is required, and a device reboot may be necessary to trigger the fix.
- **GLITCH: Missing Cards**  Some players may see incorrect prize items in place of the usual card packs on the reward screen in events; if you do not get your card packs after collecting the rewards, contact Game Support for replacements.
- **GLITCH:**  Items held by dragons may be deleted upon exiting camp.
- **GLITCH:**  Event and Season Portal tasks involving nests, eggs, or dragons are not registering properly, meaning these tasks cannot be completed until a patch arrives in a future update.
- **GLITCH:**  Level 3 shiny dragons are unmergeable;  this issue should be patched by v12.14 — please let us know if you see it after that.
- **GLITCH:**  Dragon/egg numbers are inaccurate in the Discovery Book, especially after merging or releasing dragons/eggs from orbs; a workaround is to hard-close your game from the world map screen, then reopen. Some graphic displays and labels may also be misplaced, including on dragons out in camp.
- **BETA: Item Storage**  A new feature grants item storage in a similar fashion to the Egg Storage Facility. [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n1lhxk/item_storage/)
  - **GLITCH:** Numbers listed on the storage facility may be inaccurate; only fully emptying the facility will give a true count of what you own.  
  - **GLITCH:** The facility may discharge items upon exiting camp; any items placed on the tile a previously stored item was last using will be bubbled.
- **BETA: Camp Dawnvale**  The testing pool continues to expand as devs work out the kinks in the new secondary camp; WARNING: once a player gets access to this feature, it may affect the possible rewards offered by events or other features. [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n5znsb/new_camp_camp_dawnvale/) *Reminder: Please use Spoiler tags and the “New and/or Beta” flare when posting about major new features or beta tests like this.*
- **BETA: MergeDragons Plus**  An add-on APK for Android-based has launched; it seems to function similarly to the Dragonia VIP club, and so far has no direct relationship with game-play — it’s all on the financial side. [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n0snvz/merge_dragons_plus/)
- **BETA: Potions**  A beta feature involving consumable booster potions is now out to a small but growing number of test players. If you test it and it doesn’t work, please report this to Game Support so they can pass it on to the team in charge of this beta test.  [Initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1m0oium/potions_in_camp/)
- **REMINDER:**  If you are experiencing technical issues, please contact Game Support with a description of the problem, where it occurred (if in an event, please name it and if it’s an OoC, please specify Act 1 or 2), approximately when it occurred, and (if possible) attach a recording or screenshot(s) of the issue.  Programmers *need* official support tickets to start an investigation, and having multiple players reporting on the same problem lets them directly compare affected accounts.

  - [MD Web Store](https://www.mergedragons.com/store-md) - A free, event-related trophy breed egg can usually be claimed soon after the start of a weekend event, except if it’s a brand new theme or if there’s a delayed start (it messes up the store update coding for unknown reasons).

**Other Events:**

- **Next OoC Event:**  Thanksgiving Event, 25-28 Nov

  - Tapping a square brings up the specific task requirements.
  - Dragons must be created by merging up to the target level in camp to count for “get” tasks.
  - “Level chests” refer to the [Bountiful Chests](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Bountiful_Chest#Types) gained by completing levels.
  - [Dragon Shrine Chests](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Shrine) must be purchased for 200 gems each.
  - [Level 1 Chance Chests](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Chance_Chests) are randomly included in ~20% of Kala’s Daily Trade Rucksacks and Daily Rewards; L2 or L3 do not count.
  - [Life Flower Totems](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Life_Flower_Totem) cost 160 gems to buy for use in camp; if the task says ‘anywhere’, totems can be tapped for free in levels like Totem Shire 12, Golden Meadow 10 or 19, Spell Shore 3 or 17, and Glacier Falls 5 or 15.
  - The trophy dragon breed required is usually the OoC event’s Secondary Trophy breed (link in guide below); it must be the exact level listed by the task.
- **Races:**  Tuesday and Sunday [Wiki](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Race_Event)
  - Next Up:  Rocks on Sunday, Mushrooms on Tuesday

  - BETA:  An expanded, 2 page Shiny Days is currently being tested.
- **Mystic Challenge:**  Thursday and Sunday

  - A/B Test: A limited group of players will receive Thanksgiving-themed MCs over the holiday period.
- **Card Collection:** Runs in an 8-week cycle; NOTE: Joker cards must be used as soon as collected.
- **Kingdoms:** Currently open Monday-Thursday; daily chests reset at 19:00 GMT
- **Elemental Events:** Beta testing is back, most recently held Tuesday-Friday on new Season weeks.
- **Quinn’s Lucky Games, aka Spin-the-Wheel**: Testing has restarted, but little has changed; it’s still a standard online gambling format, complete with a guaranteed big win at first to give you a nice dopamine high and make you feel “lucky”.

#EVENT FAQs

- The Event Shop and Capsules appear after healing 30-70 tiles; after that a free Bronze Capsule can be collected every 3 hours.
- It takes 5 to 6 level 9 Life Orb of the Heavens to clear all the 5k+ land, depending on how much you heal by merging items off dead land.
- To collect both the full set of Points Prizes and any level of Rush Rewards, you will need to earn 29,950 points.
  - Reaching this amount requires 1x Level 9 points item, 1x L8 item, 2x L7 items, and 2x L6 items (or just aim for 2x L9 points items).
- There’s usually enough material to merge by 3s when making Key items.
- The *Gold Capsule*, *Fallen Star*, and *Tanzanite Nest* are hiding near the far edge of the map, on tiles requiring 50k energy to heal.
- Caves must be tapped to spawn an Event [Zomblin](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Zomblins#Event_Zomblins); only one Zomblin lives in each cave, and if the cave is destroyed before being tapped it will not spawn anything useful.  When an Event Zomblin is killed, it spawns *Stinky Cheese* that can be harvested to start the [Spirit Lantern](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Lanterns) chain, which feeds into the [Spirit Rose](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Rose) chain, which produces *Dark Roses* and the *Spectral Rose Bush*.
- **Infinite Harvestables:**
  - There are usually 9x Level 1, 3x L2, 1x L3, 2x L4, and 2x L5 Infinite Harvestables (the *Coffee Makers*) on the map; you can delete one level 1 and one level 2 and still have enough to make a level 6, as long as you 5-merge whenever possible.
  - WARNING: An L6 Infinite Harvestable is required to be used as a key to complete the Event Quests.
- **Consumable/Limited Harvestables:**
  - Each 1x2 *Cafe Counter* can be harvested 25 times; 75 total harvests are needed to complete Quest 1.3.
  - Each harvest of the big 2x2 *Cozy Cafe* at the back of the map yields a 10% chance of spawning an extra *Cafe Counter*.
  - Once all available *Cafe Counters* and the *Cozy Cafe* are gone, there is no way to get more.
- **Strategy Advice:**
  - Spending money or gems is NEVER required to complete Act 1 of an event, nor is using an auto-clicker or other exploits — not even for the Rush Rewards. Act 2 Point rewards can be earned without any exploits, but Event Quests likely cannot for the higher difficulty type maps.
  - The number and level of possible reward items is determined by your Event Portal level; working to raise that to its maximum of L16 is one of the best ways to boost your overall progress in the game
  - For beginners, a good basic introduction to events is available [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Events#Out-of-Camp_Events) on the Fandom Wiki; there’s also some Wiki event guides and tips articles [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Guide_and_Tips) and [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Event_tips), and a whole collection of general guides and tutorials [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Tutorial)
  - Additional general event strategy advice (active vs passive or idle play, etc) can be found in the [Community FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/wiki/index) and in these threads: [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/w99r81/share_your_event_top_tips_please), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/uqa9q0/a_walkthru_of_my_method_to_complete_every_event), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/wi3gm4/events), and [Link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/dgk9da/step_by_step_guide_to_completing_events), [Link 5](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Guide_and_Tips).
  - For active players wanting more dragons, the Prism Flower method is a good option: [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/18jw6om/detailed_explaination_of_the_prism_flower_method/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/nihcnu/a_twist_on_the_prism_flower_method_for_events/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/wns1tb/do_you_use_the_prism_flower_method_in_events/). *Note: this technique is only for active play; since only 2 dragons at a time will harvest when left on their own, having more will actually slow down idle harvesting.*
  - A strategy using the Hills chain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/16pidhi/comment/k20zcta/) can greatly increase Life Flower production, but it usually takes a few gems (maximum of 80, but less if you get some in capsules).

#Act 2 FAQs

- **NOTE: Act 2:** The devs have been increasing the difficulty of this part of the event in recent weeks; healing requirements, Booster Chest points, and overall point requirements have all been affected — check the comment section for the latest info on what other players are seeing.
- Act 2 is an expanded version of standard Out-of-Camp events available to players with at least 5,000 dragon power; it allows players to replay the current event at a higher difficulty level for extra rewards as soon as they finish the original version (aka Act 1). The Act 2 start screen appears as soon as you earn the 10^th Points reward; you can choose to remain in Act 1, but once you begin Act 2 you cannot go back. Players that return to Act 1 can move on at any time by tapping the “Act 2” button under the event name.
  - NOTE: The very first time a player activates Act 2, a tutorial start screen appears with no option to return to Act 1.
- **Maps:** The maps follow the same general layout as Act 1, with an increased healing requirements for most tiles. Early Life Flower/Orb keys may be upgraded, grasses are replaced with Life Orbs, and Life Flowers given a higher level. Infinite Harvestables and key items are in the same locations as Act 1; Healing Goddesses are sprinkled around the map, but have little impact on progress.
- **Points:**
  - As of late September, collecting all 10 reward levels needs ~46,540 points, or the equivalent of 2x level 9 point items plus 1x level 8 and 1x level 7.
  - Collecting only the first 8 rewards needs 1x level 9 point item plus 1x level 6 item; collecting only the first 6 rewards needs 1x level 8 point item plus 1x level 7 item plus 2x level 6 items.
  - NOTE: Some players have recently reported different point values; how widespread this is remains to be seen.
- **Healing:**  The healing requirements are still being adjusted by the devs; in general the number of higher energy tiles has increased, and the easy-to-heal area at the start has shrunk. 
  - Recent reports say it’s taken 18-20 level 9 Life Orbs to heal the full map, but this may vary substantially as the devs continue tweaking requirements.
- **Booster Chests:** Opening Event Chests, Capsules, and Dimension Jars and purchasing items from the store in Act 1 yield points that earn bonus items for use in Act 2.  **UPDATE:** Booster Chest point requirements appear to be undergoing adjustment by the devs, with significant increases for at least some players.
  - Bronze Capsules = 12 points each, level 2 Event Chests = 6p, and Dimension Jars = 20p
- **Gold Pass:** The Act 1 Gold Pass does not carry over to Act 2, which has its own, separate Gold Pass available for purchase at the same price; you can buy one, both, or neither.
- **Event Quests:** Event Quest progress is reset and task difficulty increases *drastically* in Act 2; finishing in Act 1 is recommended if you wish to earn the EQ rewards.
- **Strategy Advice:** Most OoC strategies work, but healing the full Act 2 map is extremely difficult.
  - The simplest strategy is to heal and clear out the low-energy tiles near the start, then merge up and idle farm a pair of level 2 Infinite Harvestables; point rewards can comfortably be finished in a day if mass-merging 1-2 times per hour.
  - Merging up to a pair of level 3 IH will speed up progress, but the difficulty of this varies by map design and placement of the existing L2 IH.
  - Remaining in Act 1 long enough to earn the level 4 Infinite Harvestable may pay off by allowing a single dragon to harvest points with minimal land clearance; this is especially useful in cases where the L1 and L2 IH are difficult to clear, but recent changes to the booster point system may make this impractical for many… and lately there’s a glitch that has prevented some from getting the correct IH.
  - Prism Flowers cannot be purchased from the store, but seeds and sprouts are randomly included in some Bronze Capsules.

#SAVING YOUR PROGRESS

- Make sure to save your progress by traveling to the World Map screen (and waiting there until everything’s fully loaded) regularly, and especially before closing your game.  
- Exiting directly from the event level to your Camp can trigger a crash and/or loss of items; always exit to the World Map screen first, and again after releasing prize items into your camp, as well as after merging high-level or valuable dragons/items.

&nbsp;

#EVENT TROUBLESHOOTING

If the event is not showing up correctly or if glitches are affecting your play:

1. Check that you meet the version and dragon power requirements.
2. Try hard-closing and then relaunching your game.
3. Try rebooting your device (ie, turn it completely off, then back on and allow it to fully boot up before relaunching the game). If you are on wifi and have access to the router, try rebooting that, too.
4. Try switching to a completely different internet source.
5. Try clearing your game’s cache (google for instructions for your specific phone type).
6. If you’re suddenly experiencing multiple issues like lagging or error messages (or if the event vanishes completely), close the game and try again after 2-3 hours. Events are internet-based, and sometimes issues with the servers can cause temporary problems — all we can do for that is to wait it out.
7. If none of the above helps, contact Gram Games Support through the in-game link or the [Support Web Portal](https://gramgames.helpshift.com/hc/en/9-merge-dragons-1497457953/) for help figuring out what’s wrong; please include the name of the event and whether the problem is with Act 1 or 2.  If you use email, you’ll need your game ID and version number, both of which can be copied for pasting from the Settings tab, or (if you can’t get into the game at all) by hand from the game’s loading screen.

**Chronic Problems**  (*New warnings are added at the end of list*)

- **Cloud Save is still unreliable:** According to the last official statements from the developers, it is not safe to be used and should be left turned off.

1p374gm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p374gm,What color curtains?,"TLDR: blush pink or sage (or olive) green curtains?

You might recognize this rug from my initial post a month ago. Thanks to everyone for their wonderful advice! Your advice was a real help for styling the room. The rug itself is so (wonderfully) bold, and I was really floundering on how to design the room with it in mind.

Art has been added to the walls, the couch and coffee table has been pushed back, blankets and pillows were swapped out to complement the rug, and the TV was finally ordered and delivered. We're on the hunt for a bookshelf or shelving unit for the left hand corner of the room, so while that space is currently empty it won't be for long. The gallery wall around the TV is also a WIP.

My question is, what curtain color should we go with? I am leaning towards either blush pink curtains, or sage or olive green curtains. The rug is red enough already that I don't want to add MORE red to the room. The room is also north facing, so I am hesitant to go with blue curtains (despite there being blue in the rug). I am also a little worried that ivory curtains would just blend into the wall and do nothing to compliment the rug.

I also included a photo in the last slide that was from when we initially rolled the rug out, so folks can have a better idea as to what colors and pattern I'm working with here.

I'm about 10 months postpartum and looking to lose weight. I am 32, 5'4, and 275lbs. I hate it because prior to my second pregnancy, I was getting my life on track. I'd started crossfit and used OMAD and keto and IF and gotten to 215lbs before I found out I was pregnant and had to stop most of those. I stayed In the 220s all the way until birth, been ballooning ever since.

Idk what different about this time, but keto by itself just is not giving me the same results. Ive gained 40lbs since birth and Ive set myself back 5 years. I decided to do an extended fast (my first one in years). Im currently 60 hours in with my only intake being 2 cups of coffee a day with a pinch of salt. I worked out last night. Im down 10lbs, I know most of that is probably water. I feel good! Not as sluggish as Ive been feeling prior. 

But now Im at an impasse. What is the next best move? Do I keep this fast going as long as I can? Im not feeling particularly hungry and can probably go another day or two or 5. Ive been reading that there may be drawbacks. Maybe I keep it going but just do it dirty to offset negative effects? Or keto or OMAD for a while to keep the fat burning benefits while also trying to reteach myself about eating without overindulging? 

Sometimes I feel like I benefit from restricted diets or fasts because its easier for me to say ""no, i cant have that at all"" vs ""you can have that, but just a little"" because by the end of the day, that little turns into a lot and then I'm binging thinking ""well I effed up, might as well party until its time to start again."" But then that ruins all my progress. It also pops up a lot when Im stressed or not a busy body, so weekends are full of temptation. I'm considering doing weekly 48hrs fasts friday and saturdays since those are my most tempted days. But idk.

I'm just trying to find a strategy that will 1. Help me lose the weight, 2. Not negatively affect my health, and 3. Will transition me to a sustainable and holtiscally healthy diet.



A little more context if its helpful: Ive struggled with my weight my whole life. My heaviest was at 23, I was 330lbs, high blood pressure, etc. I started  working out and did keto and dropped to 275 at 27. Then to 250 the next year. I had my first baby at 29, went up a little bit, but thats when I started the crossfit and got down to my lowest adult weight of 215 right before getting pregnant again. Now Im back to 275 and it sucks! I want to live long and be able to play with my kids.",0,1763751531.0,fasting,2,0.5,False

Then i had a baby and was desperate for coffee and we caved and got a cheap Nespresso. Said baby is now almost 1.5 y o and mama is ready to get back into the espresso game.

I’m looking at a few machines and i have no clue what to buy. 

I see the dielleta mio  on sale for 1200. Great video on it.  I like the temp control, timer, and pressure gauge. Looks like there are no plastic parts.

My budget is 1500$ or less but part of me is wondering do i really need to spend this much money? I have a small kitchen, small counter space and small children so i need lots of caffeine. I find the process of prepping the coffee so therapeutic.

Gaggia and rancillo machines look ugly to me? Idk if it’s just me or ? I’m in a weird mood.


I want to control temp, steam milk, not wait more than 5-7 mins to heat up. Drink good coffee, obsess about crema and extraction, watch my espresso brew thru an open portafilter. I’d like to learn to make pretty latte art. Climb Everest maybe ? And also learn how to properly use the pressure gauge. Also do not want any plastic parts.

I’m 25 days into this and it’s been so difficult. About 22 years of pounding coffee, diet sodas, and energy drinks.

I quit cold turkey and got through the headaches and energy dips. However, my sleep is suffering. Before quitting, I developed a habit of eating a snack upon first wake up 12:00-1:30 AM, then I was able to go back to sleep. It was a shitty habit but I guess it calmed my nervous system. 

This drove me to quit caffeine but it hasn’t been that simple. I’ve developed a strict protocol.

7:00 pm - blue blockers on
7:45 pm - light 150 calorie snack , Greek yogurt/cottage cheese, half of banana 
8:00 pm - 400 mg magnesium glycinate 
8:15 pm- dim light, breath work, light classical in bedroom 
9:15 pm -2.5 grams of Melatonin, lowering it today to 1.25 grams, lights out.

Ive been wake up between 11:30 pm and- 1:00 am and can’t really fall asleep after that. I lay there till 5:00 am.

5:00 am-5:20 am - I get up slam 24 oz of ice water and electrolytes and sit under a circadian rhythm light for 20 minutes.

This has sucked so bad, I hurt the rest of the day with a feeling of sluggish energy. Am I doing too much? Should I just can all the supplements?

Will this take months perhaps? I appreciate all comments, thanks.

1p36xeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1p36xeb/milestone_achieved_pmp_cert_project_closeout/,Milestone achieved!  PMP cert project closeout,"# Greetings, fellow PMP seekers!

I know there are already so many of these, but as a long-time lurker, reading all these posts not only motivated me to keep going but was really insightful in discovering different ways people were approaching their exam prep. Today, thankfully, I passed AT/AT/AT and had 45 minutes to spare. So I figured I'd pay it forward.

# Initiation

I'm a project manager currently, and have worked on predictive, hybrid, agile projects. However, my real-world experience differed greatly from the academic side that the test assesses. I probably had a leg up on understanding roles within a project, but I had to really undo a lot of the processes and behaviors the test looks at. I also work full-time and have 2 young kids, so lengthy study time was hard to come by. I earned my PDUs in January but didn't get serious about studying until I finally drew a line in the sand and scheduled my exam two months out.

# Planning

PMI Study Hall Essentials:

* When I think back to everything I leveraged, the practice questions and exams were probably the most important. They helped me more with being able to build endurance and practice dissecting the questions.
* Something that really helped me was practicing using short keys to highlight and strikethrough words in the question or answer. It helped mitigate the need to re-read.
* Practice Full-length Exam Average: 72%. I took all 5 mocks (74/77/78/66/65), only timeboxed exam 3 to an actual 4-hour window.
* Mini-Exam Average: 78%. I took these after all the practice questions. I only retook 6-8 of the mini exams to just see if I had overcome some of my initial shortfalls a month prior.
* Practice Questions: 74% average.

Andrew Ramdayal Resources:

* AR's Udemy Course for 35 PDUs. I started going through it at the normal pace, but switched it up halfway through to quickly get through it.
* Complete PMP Mindset 50 Principles and Questions (YouTube). One of the best videos to watch, I watched twice in my prep. It definitely helped me quickly eliminate answers during the exam.
* 200 Ultra Hard PMP Questions 1-200 (YouTube). I would pause each question and answer myself before getting the answer. I feel like after watching this video, I really started to see a change in my study hall practice questions and exam scores.

David McLachlan's Resources:

* The Complete Project Management Body of Knowledge in One Video (PMBOK 7th Edition) (YouTube
* 150 PMBOK 7 Scenario-Based PMP Exam Questions and Answers (YouTube). I would pause each question and answer myself before getting the answer.
* The PMP Fast Track - the FASTEST way to get up to speed for your PMP Exam (YouTube)
* Want to Pass your PMP? DON'T DO These 6 Things! (Youtube)
* The PMP Cheat Sheet - How to Tell if You're Ready for the PMP Exam (YouTube)

Mohammed Rahman Resources:

* \[CRASH COURSE\] Full PMP Mindset Training + Workbook (YouTube). A lot of people swore by this one, but I thought it was ok. Liked AR's more.

Ricardo Vargas Resources:

* PMBOK® Guide 6th Ed Processes Explained with Ricardo Vargas (YouTube)! This is an older video, but it was key to undoing my predictive process knowledge and aligning it to the PMP content. Really good video. I even printed off the sheet to have it with me.

Third3Rock's Study Guide. Loved being able to read through this when I was tired of looking at a screen.

# Execution

* In the few days leading up to the exam day, I made sure to NOT do any practice questions because I was worried about getting burned out. So I set a deadline to have all that finished by a week prior. Spent the remaining days reviewing the AR mindset video and Third3Rock's study guide.
* I scheduled a morning exam because my mind feels more alive early in the day.
* Morning of the exam, I listened to the last three DM videos I listed above, which I think are great high-level review videos. Ate a yogurt, drank a bottle of water, and had some coffee.
* Took my exam in person at Pearson. I couldn't recommend it more. Taking it online was not going to be an option because my kids are loud as hell sometimes lol. Pearson employees were great and honestly made me a little more loose and relaxed going into the exam room.
* I cannot stress enough, the best prep I did was practicing answering questions and utilizing the highlighter and strikethrough tools to help me dissect the questions visually. I credit that to my having excess time at the end.
* Take the two breaks; it doesn't count against your time unless you come back late. I used it to drink some water and just walk around a bit.
* Flag questions that you really have no clue about or are toss-ups. I went with my gut and tried not to second-guess. Limit the use of flagging to mitigate having to review a ton at the end.
* The questions themselves were tough and much like Study Hall. I honestly thought I was going to maybe scrape by because there were just a large number that I felt two answers were either very good or both bad.

# Closing

I personally think this subreddit was the greatest resource I came across in my journey. I really had no clue where to even begin when I decided to go for my PMP, and the PMI website and Google were not helpful at all. This community helped me immensely just by understanding what other people were doing to help me develop my own strategy. **If anyone is interested in getting their PMP, they need to join this sub.** Other than that, I learned a ton from the videos above to understand the material and apply the mindset when testing.

I lean over, smile, and say, “Aww, what a cute little potato!”

She stares at me like I’ve just insulted three generations of her family.

So I try to clarify.
BIG mistake.

I go: “No! Not like a bad potato. Like a GOOD potato. A adorable potato. Like… a premium one?”

The barista is choking trying not to laugh. The mom is looking at me like I’m describing her child as produce in a USDA inspection.

At this point I’m overheating like a laptop in a blanket, so I grab my coffee to flee.
Except…it’s not my coffee.
It’s HER coffee.
She says, “That’s mine,” in the rudest voice I’ve ever heard.

I apologize, put it back, and in my panic I try to “lighten the mood.”
So I say:

“Sorry. I swear I’m not usually this weird.”

Why did I say that.
Why did I bring attention to the weirdness.
Why am I alive.

We get him to our second to last room and the bartender comes up to the desk with her receipts. He looks at her and says ""Hey babe. My new wife just kicked me out of our room. You wanna come to my new room and cheer me up?"". She of course denied him and insulted him. He went to his room alone.

It is super cool but I have no idea what to do with it. Being from a city this style of mailbox is sentimental to me and I’m desperately trying to come up with a project I can use it for.

My current “best” ideas are:

- Lay it flat, build some kind of base for it and find a piece of glass to cover it and use it as a coffee table.

- Build a frame around it (it is meant to be inset into a wall, but I don’t really have the capabilities to install it this way) and hang it on the wall to store things. Not really sure what I could conveniently store in 6 individually keyed locked mailboxes but I guess that’s a problem for another day. 

- put it in some relatives attic until I eventually get to using it for something (which may be never).

- BONUS: Resell it on eBay and make it someone else’s problem!


The last two are last resorts, it’s not like I don’t want it, I’d really like to figure out a good use for it but I’m struggling to come up with an idea. It’s just so cool to own one of these things and now that I have it I need to put it to use!

I just want to share my experiance that might help someone else!

  
I get hooked up on coffee for the recent years. I drink 3 cups a day, morning, lunch, and after work at home.    
  
Always felt lazy, dizzy, low energy, so I thought that cup at 17 o'clock could help, I need things to do, right?

Turns out it made everything worse. I stopped drinking coffee on the afternoon at home for a few days and I feel much better. I'm less sleepy, tired, have a better mood, have more energy.

Maybe I'm just more sensitive to caffeine, but there are many articles saying that it worsens depressive symptoms. 

I say just give it a try, if you feel you are in a similar shoes!

1p36exk,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIPDMV/comments/1p36exk/why_kalispell_was_right_for_us/,Why Kalispell Was Right For Us,"Simply put, Kalispell was right for us because it was right for you, and our clients will always be our top priority. Before we get into the advantages that Kalispell has to offer from a tax and vehicle registration standpoint, we wanted to share more about our great appreciation for the town we do business in.

For those unaware, Kalispell is a city in northwest Montana. It has a population of 31,000+ and is home to some of the hardest-working and most down-to-earth individuals in the state. As the 7th-most populous city in Montana, Kalispell has seen a lot of growth since 2010.

Translated as the ""flat land above the lake,"" Kalispell sits above Flathead Lake, which is the largest natural freshwater lake in the Western U.S. by surface area. The surrounding nature and wildlife can be attributed to the bountiful resources the lake provides. When in town, you’re just a short drive from Glacier National Park, Whitefish Mountain, and other epic outdoor spots. It’s the kind of place where weekends are made for hiking, fishing, and skiing.

There's a true sense of community here in Kalispell, and it's an aspect that makes us truly proud to call this place our home. From local coffee shops to historic buildings that have stood the test of time since the 1800s, we love doing business here and being a contributing member to the local economy that continues to grow.

Whether we're starting our day with some biscuits and gravy from Sykes or celebrating a successful week at Moose's Saloon, we love calling Kalispell our home. 

**Financial Incentives**

The tax structure here in Kalispell is a bit different and is the main reason why registering your vehicle with us here at VIP DMV makes a ton of sense. First, there is no state sales tax in the state of Montana. That means big purchases, like a luxury vehicle, don't come with a hefty bill from the state. For example, a $75,000 car or pickup purchase could carry a $4,000–$7,500 tax on it depending on where you live.

On top of that, Kalispell doesn't have mandatory periodic safety or emissions inspections for most non-commercial vehicles, which means, more often than not, you don't need to get a yearly inspection to maintain your vehicle's registration.

While it may not seem like much, those bills add up over the years and can be a real pain to deal with if your vehicle doesn't pass regulations imposed by other states. While the benefits are great to begin with, we thought the process could be improved upon and decided that it was time to do just that with our services here at VIP DMV.

Whether you're registering from out-of-state or from right here in Kalispell, we will save you time and money with our tried and true process of forming your Montana LLC and registering your vehicle to the LLC directly. We're built for efficiency, which is why we've bypassed the necessity of driving to the DMV with an online system that you can utilize right from your home. In a few simple steps, you'll have your vehicle registered and ready to drive in no time at all. Seriously, we ship plates in as little as three days once we have all your paperwork properly filed.",1,1763749916.0,VIPDMV,0,1.0,False

Like what actually separates the two for you? F18,"So the other night I was hanging out with two of my friends, and we got into this whole conversation about dating, right? And one of them—Alyssa—was telling us about this guy she’d been talking to for, like, three weeks. She swore everything was going great. He’d text her good morning, hype her up before her exams, send her random memes… the whole thing felt like a slow-burn, kinda cute “maybe this is going somewhere” vibe.
But then she said something that actually made me stop and think. She was like, “I can never tell if a guy is getting to know me because he likes me or just because he’s bored.” And at first we laughed, but then my other friend was like, “No, seriously. Same.” And suddenly we’re all sitting there with our iced coffees, overthinking every interaction we’ve ever had.

Then it got deeper.
Alyssa said she felt like modern dating is basically a guessing game:
— Is he interested?
— Is he entertaining options?
— Is he just lonely?
— Or is he actually trying to build something real?

And honestly, I couldn’t even argue, because I’ve felt that exact same confusion. Like, you can vibe with someone for weeks, talk every day, and still have no idea what their actual intentions are. And the more we talked, the more we realized none of us had ever just straight-up asked a guy what the difference is between when he’s dating with intention… and when he’s just passing time.
So later that night, I was thinking about it again, and I was like—this is actually such a good question for guys, because girls genuinely don’t get a clear answer to it.",2,1763749843.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

This post is primarily self-reflection, while making space for input for people who are in a similar boat. Here it is...

I didn't know what LSD or status changes were until a week ago. I stumbled upon this reddit thread, and the rest is history. I made an account, studied up on the lingo, and have been obsessive ever since. I check LSD and this thread in the morning when I wake up instead of making my coffee and taking my dog for a walk. Stepping back, what is so wild to me about the obsession that has possessed me is that *it doesn't change anything*. I just know more about what I can't control, and, in some ways, feel more out of control than when I had just submitted applications and moved on with my life. 

I am not applying to law school for the sake of applying; I am doing so because I work in natural resource management and am painfully privy to the power that law & policy hold over the future of natural resource management in this country. It is a legacy that will surely outlive me, and I would like to be a part of (re)writing. That being said, I have found that, recently, less of my identity is tied to my work (the *why* behind attending law school) and more has become tied to the fact that I am going to law school at all. The time I spend *creeping a rando* instead of doing my job is a prime example of that. 

I am an anxious person, as I can assume we all are here. Having as much knowledge as I can about the status of my applications is a momentary salve for my anxiety. Ultimately, though, I am left more aware of the space between what I do know and what I can't know than ever before. 

Instead, I am trying to adopt a new attitude: I put my heart, soul, and self out there in these applications. Those admissions counselors know me as well as anyone sitting on the opposite coast staring at a piece of paper possibly could. If they think that the person they are learning about is a right fit for their institution, they will let me know. If not, ce la vie. I can't be anything but me. I am not going to sit inside and obsess over the implications of word changes under status banners, because that is a belittling of myself. I am instead going to continue to be the person that I put out there in those applications so that, if someone decides that I am worth attending their institution, I will feel like I am worthy of that acceptance.

No strings attached, we ain’t spam folks, we’re a group of seasoned veterans who have been running this for 8 years. Below a story of myself back when Switzerland decided to drop the CHF peg to give ya’ll a smell how it works on the floor.

Next article coming up is about Zoom (ZM) their earnings as I’m also tutoring 3 students full time, and with one we do constant follow up on options. But first, let us go back to the day the Swiss tried to fondue our balls.

**The Swiss FX chainsaw massacre**

After our brief getaway on anomalous events surrounding Brexit & Lehman, I’d like to highlight another storm in a glass of water. The Swiss peg and its aftermath. It deserves its place in the history books. It was an eventful day as, then head of Market Risk in a high street UK bank.

Let us go back to Canary Wharf where, in the morning, we still didn’t expect what a crazy day it would turn out to be. It was crazy, with Alpari UK as one of the first deaths on arrival which we heard live on the phone.

***00:05 Canary Wharf Elevator, Suspiciously Calm***

The elevator hums like a morally dubious lullaby.

I’m Ross, Head of Market Risk, I’m expecting a normal Thursday. Stale MTMs, broken STPs, a few trades misbooked as “*Forward-Forward-Spot-Thing*,” and Ollie shouting obscenities at yield curves like they insulted his mother. A usual day in the office is what we back then expected. This is common lingo in my team back then.

Nothing trembles yet...  
But something **feels** crooked.

***00:22 The Floor: Pre-Chaos Static Electricity***

I step out.  
Everything is too still.  
Traders are quiet in that eerie pre-meltdown way.

**Elena**, formerly Swiss-desk, now gold/FX cross-over, Siberian-bred and sarcasm-fed, stares at screens like they owe her money.

She mutters in Russian-accented English:  
“Ross… something is *fucked*.”

If she says it’s fucked, it’s already in the ICU.

**Ollie** the fixed income psychopath is preemptively raging:  
*“These Swiss curves look like they were calibrated by a toddler smashing a calculator with a sausage! I swear FINMA uses Hello Kitty Island Adventure as a risk model!”*

And **Jean-René**, our FX trader, is pacing with the energy of a caffeinated goose being hunted. French profanity leaks out of him like CO₂ from a leaky soda bottle.

Nothing has happened yet.

***00:58 The First Hairline Crack***

Elena waves me over. *“Ross, gold is twitching like a nervous goat on steroids. CHF vols look like they drank jet fuel. My cross-correlation matrix is doing interpretive dance.”*

I glance at her screen. The gold/CHF co-movement looks like a cardiogram during a heart attack.

“*Is something happening in Switzerland?*” I ask.

Elena shrugs. “Is always happening in Switzerland. Usually cheese. This looks worse.”

***01:31 Ollie Loses Faith in Mathematics***

“ROSS!” He’s red-faced, hair everywhere, like he slept inside a Bloomberg terminal.

***“MUREX IS LYING TO ME. AGAIN.”***

He hurls a stress ball at the screen.

*“The overnight curve reload gave me a shape I haven’t seen since Lehman. It’s like someone put* ***gamma, vomma, and trauma*** *into a* ***blender****.”*

I ask calmly, *“What’s wrong with the curve?*”

*“What’s wrong? WHAT’S WRONG? The thing’s implying negative forward rates for an economy that hasn’t sneezed yet today!”*

***02:06 Jean-René Receives a Premonition***

He storms toward me, phone vibrating in one hand.

*“ROSS. PUTAIN. SOMETHING IS COMING. You know this? You FEEL this? The CHF spot feed keeps freezing and unfroze like it’s trying to warn me.”*

His wife texts him about winter holiday bookings. He calls her back:

*“NO. CANCEL SWITZERLAND. I DON’T TRUST THESE MADMEN. WE GO TO ALPE D’HUEZ. OUI. FRANCE. A COUNTRY THAT DOESN’T WAKE UP AND TORCH ITS OWN CURRENCY BEFORE BREAKFAST.”*

He hangs up and adds:  
*“Fucking helvetic circus.”*

***02:42 Bayesian Update #1: Sharp and Non-Convex***

Priors collapse like over levered hedge funds.Probability the Swiss do something stupid today jumps from 10% to 70% with zero convexity in between. The floor buzzes. Phones vibrate. Spreads widen for no reason. The Greeks begin to twitch:

*Gamma spikes*

*Vega sneezes*

*Cross-gamma mutters slurs*

*dVega/dSpot collapses like wet cardboard*

Something ugly is forming.

***03:10 Elena’s Russians Sense Doom***

Her gold ticks start jumping.

*“Ross,”* she growls, *“either someone is* ***testing nukes*** *under Geneva or* ***Swiss gnomes touching something they should not****.”*

Her xccy swaps show spreads so wide you could park a bus in the basis.

“*CHF legs are doing spasibo, but no spasibo dance.*”

She crosses herself. I’ve never seen her do that. This… is bad.

***03:47 Stillness Before the Swiss Tsunami***

Phone calls intensify. Rumors accelerate. The Bayesian surface looks like a 3D plot of a nervous breakdown. VAR begins to pre-flash like Christmas lights wired incorrectly.

Jean-René yells:  
*“I DON’T LIKE THE WAY SPOT IS BREATHING. IT’S BREATHING LIKE A SERIAL KILLER.”*

***04:00|09:30 CET {THE ANNOUNCEMENT}***

The SNB drops the peg. And the world ends in 0.8 seconds.

*GBP/CHF falls off a cliff. 20%, then 22%, then 25%.*

Jean-René screams:  
***“PUTAIN DE MOTHERFUCKING SUISSE! THEY DID IT! THEY DROPPED THE PEG! THEY SET THEIR ECONOMY ON FIRE LIKE A FUCKING FONDUE LEFT IN THE OVEN!”***

Ollie screams:  
***“THE CURVE IS BACKWARDATING FORWARD RATES THAT HAVEN’T EVEN BEEN INVENTED YET!”***

Elena grabs her headset with existential fury: ***“My gold book is doing perestroika against my will!”***

***\[****A brief note: please realize that these sudden “flash crashes” which happen from time to time in the financial markets leaves many traders, risk managers and their respective managers with little hope to fix material problems in seconds. Positions can’t be closed as various algorithms speed up this process that manually you simply can’t keep up a sell order because in microseconds the order can’t be fulfilled anymore. This can be utterly frustrating if your position goes -20% in the matter of minutes and there is nothing you can do except look at your figures turn more red.****\]***

***04:07 The Killer Minute***

The floor erupts.Phones scream. 

Someone yells:  
*“I NEED A LIVE PRICE!*”  
Another:  
*“GOOD LUCK, THERE’S NO MARKET!*”  
A third:  
*“TRY A BROKER!”*  
A fourth:  
*“BROKERS AREN’T ANSWERING!”*

And then the first casualty is announced:

*“ALPARI UK JUST WENT DARK!”*

A silence hits the room. The first casualty of Swiss monetary fondue.

***04:18 The Big Choice***

Two options, both suicidal:

**A) Hedge now.**  
Into a liquidity black hole. Slippage so large it counts as a war crime.

**B) Sell everything CHF-related before the world realizes CHF is the new nuclear-safe metal.**

The traders look at me.

*“Ross… what’s the strategy?”*

I channel the deepest, darkest wisdom:

“*Fake certainty. Act decisively.*”

***04:25 4-Bloomberg Split Screen***

**Left:** GBP/CHF dying  
**Right:** Gold exploding  
**Top:** Volatility screaming  
**Bottom:** Risk e-mails flashing “URGENT” like a horny alarm clock

Elena:  
*“My correlations are not correlations. They are performance art.”*

Ollie:  
*“I NEED A FUNCTIONAL CURVE, NOT THIS SWISS CHEESE HOLE OF A THING!”*

Jean-René:  
*“I WILL NEVER EAT RACLETTE AGAIN. I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER.”*

***04:40 The Slowdown***

Chaos fades into numb exhaustion. Refresh rates stabilize. Quotes reappear like traumatised animals. Someone finally drinks their cold coffee.

Elena groans:  
*“I have seen death. It looks like Swiss franc.*”

Ollie sits back.  
*“I want FINMA charged* ***with war crimes****.*”

Jean-René slumps in his chair.  
*“Alpe d’Huez. We go to France. Switzerland is dead to me.”*

***05:00 Aftermath***

The floor is quiet in that post-trauma way like everyone has simultaneously aged ten years and lost three kidneys. Coffee cups everywhere. A trading book that smells faintly of smoke.  
Three traders sitting like war survivors in ergonomic chairs. I’m about to exhale the first exhale since 09:29 CET when suddenly…

**ENTER: Risk Reporting.**

A kid.  
Fresh.  
Bright-eyed.  
Hair perfectly parted.  
Carrying an Excel printout like a peace offering.

He approaches me with *catastrophic optimism*.

**Risk Reporting Kid:** *“Hi Ross! Um… Group Board wants a quick memo on the impact of the Swiss FX peg removal… you know, like… a summary of exposures… potential P&L… maybe a Bayesian forward-looking statement?”*

I stare at him. 

My traders stare at me.

**Elena**, whispering in Russian:  
*“Get this small rabbit out of my battlefield. Before I eat him.”*

**Ollie**, eyes bulging:  
*“I swear to GOD if he says the word ‘quick’ again I’ll hedge him out of the building.”*

**Jean-René**, in quiet nuclear-level French:  
*“Sacrebleu… take him away, Ross. Before I commit an HR incident.”*

The kid keeps smiling: *“Just a short note! One pager? Maybe two? Group ExCo says it’s urgent!”*

I inhale through my soul.

I nod.

*“Sure. Absolutely. Give me a moment.”*

The kid beams like a Swiss regulator ignoring warning signs. “Great! I’ll come back in ten minutes!”

He skips away.  
Actually skips.

The traders look at me with pure **“kill me”** energy.

I sit back down, pull out a pen, and tell them:

*“Alright. They want a memo. Let’s hear your versions of what happened. Short. Concise. No swearing.”*

They stare at me like I told them to price exotics on an ABACUS.

**Elena (FX/Com):** “Okay Ross, memo for Group Board.

*Swiss dropped peg. Market died. Everyone became bald. Gold went up like Putin on New Year vodka. CHF legs on my xccy swaps started convulsing like goat with electricity. Liquidity was zero, spreads wider than Siberia. We hedged, unhedged, re-hedged, mis-hedged, prayed, and then hedged again for symbolic reasons.*

Impact to bank:  
*We survived.*  
*Barely.*

Recommendation:  
*Never trust Swiss again.*  
*Or gold correlation matrix.*  
*Or computers.”*

She crosses her arms.

*“Put that in memo. Tell them Elena says hello.”*

***Ollie (Fixed Income): He rubs his temples like they owe him money.*** 

***Note from me:***

***Everything. Went. Sideways.***

*Murex had a meltdown, the curve reload looked like Picasso painted a yield curve using his feet. Forward rates implied interstellar travel. I screamed at FINMA. FINMA did not respond.*  
*Probably too busy playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure on risk breaks.*

Impact to bank:  
*We didn’t blow up.*  
*But the Swiss nearly gave me a stroke.*

Recommendation:  
*Ban Switzerland from financial markets.*  
*Replace CHF with cheese-backed token.*  
*Call it ‘FondueCoin.’”*

He nods solemnly.

“*Write it professionally though*.”

***Jean-René (FX)***

He takes a deep breath.  
This will be operatic.

“Memo from FX desk:  
*The peg died.*  
*We all died with it.*

*GBP/CHF fell like a piano pushed off the Eiffel Tower.*

Liquidity? *Merde.*  
Quotes? *Merde.*  
Greeks? All tits up. Gamma was screaming, vega crying, vol-of-vol defecating on my P&L.

I swore in French for two hours.  
My wife cancelled Switzerland.  
We go to Alpe d’Huez now.  
Safer.  
The snow does not lie.  
The Swiss do.

Impact to bank:  
*We have scars now.*  
*Emotional and financial.*

Recommendation:  
*Never peg anything to anything ever again.”*

I close the notebook.

“Perfect,” I say.  
“Exactly the sort of completely useless input senior management loves.”

They all smirk with dead souls.

The kid returns chirping, glowing, brimming with hope.

*“Ross! You have the memo?”*

Before I can answer, all three traders stand up simultaneously.

**Elena:**  
*“Tell Board we lost money, made money, almost died, still alive. That is memo.”*

**Ollie:**  
*“Add that Swiss curves should be classified as biological hazards.”*

**Jean-René:**  
*“Put that the FX desk did heroic work. And that Switzerland should be fined for emotional damage.”*

They pat me on the shoulder, grab their jackets, and walk off in slow-motion like a traumatised Avengers team. As they leave, Elena yells back across the floor:

*“ROSS! IF BOARD NEED MORE DETAIL, TELL THEM TO CHECK YOUTUBE FOR ‘FINANCIAL PANIC COMPILATION.’ WE ARE EPISODE TWO!”*

And with that, they vanish down the corridor bruised, sarcastic, heroic in their incompetence, leaving me alone with a terrified risk reporting intern clutching his spreadsheet of doom.

I sigh. Turn back to my screen.

And begin typing the most diplomatic lie of my career.

Like, I’m worried about getting too much of a good thing. If I manifest a free coffee, I feel like I need to pay for the next to balance things out. That’s just an example, but I feel this often when I manifest people to come back to me, or something free. This feeling has made it harder to manifest again after receiving the first thing. I’m not sure if this makes sense, but if it doesn’t I can try explaining it better. ",3,1763749749.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

Companies like Luckin coffee are leaning heavily into that and honestly I think it was a huge mistake to get rid of the mobile order only stores. Go to any fast food joint these days and you get either AI drive thru ordering or kiosks to place your order at. I think all stores should have kiosks implemented to free up someone having to take fronts so they can focus solely on warming and packing delivery orders. Let's be real it's hard sometimes to juggle warming, front and packing deliveries especially on the weekends. Also to be honest nobody really wants to take the front orders anyway it's a hassle to stop and watch the food backup because grandma doesn't know what she wants and is hmmm'ing and hawing. Also let's be honest again with saying customers don't want to talk to us and we don't really want to talk to them either. We are happiest when we are left alone to make the drinks and they are happiest taking their drinks and bouncing. Lots of places are grab and go only or are shifting that way so starbucks going backwards doesn't make sense. It's just better for everyone in the long run if the company would stop trying to act like a 50 year old dude trying to squeeze his ass into his highschool letterman jacket thinking he's still the big man on campus when he's taking a backseat to more attractive options out there and keeps sliding downwards.

1p36b3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1p36b3y/thoughts_on_an_affordable_social_clubcommunity_hub/,Thoughts on an affordable social club/community hub?,"Every good business should solve a problem for its customers. 

I've been thinking a lot about social isolation, loneliness, and the lack of ""third spaces"" in the US specifically. A third space is essentially somewhere you can go - other than work and home - to just *be*, run into friends/new friends, and just exist (without being forced to spend a lot of money).

My (very conceptual) idea is to start a membership based social club that would provide a comfortable place to hang out and socialize. The business model would be membership-based, ideally targeting an accessible price point of perhaps $20-$35/month. 

I view the cost accessibility as key here. There are plenty of examples of high-end social clubs (Soho House, country clubs, etc.) with $300+/mo membership dues and huge joining fees. But those of course have WAY nicer facilities, and cater to the wealthy - not something I'm particularly interested in, nor something I have the capital to start. 

My thinking is a reasonable price point to attract a wider variety of people, and hopefully make up for the low price point with volume (i.e. aim to reach \~400+ members in a relatively low-cost space before considering expanding)

**I do not see this as a ""cash cow"" business by any means**. I see it as a way to hopefully create genuine community/address a social need and turn a small but sustainable profit. I have two other businesses and my personal income needs are met by those. This is just a side project I'm exploring. I'm also not married to this idea, I'm just ideating currently. 

The space itself would be lounge-like; comfortable couches, perhaps some gaming systems/TVs, maybe a self-serve/honor system selection of NA refreshments, maybe a pool table, etc. A couple desks so people can get some work done. Maybe a coffee station (self-serve). Some fun perks that are cheap to deliver, like a free popcorn machine.   
  
**Business model:**   

* Monthly memberships as a primary revenue driver; targeting \~$20-$40/mo or so per person (accessible for many people, but still an investment)
* Secondary revenue sources:
   * Paid events for non-members
   * Guest passes
   * Premium events that are paid (with discount) for members, open to non-members
   * Space rental? 
   * On-site sales of refreshments. Likely non alcohol, at least to start, to keep costs/complexity relatively low. Unstaffed, either honor system or vending machine
   * Sponsorships/partnerships with local businesses
   * Group/corporate memberships
* Minimal staffing to keep costs down; depending on the setup, either unstaffed (remote entry + remote monitored cameras), or partially staffed (i.e. staffed during busy hours, unstaffed other times)
   * Partner with community builders who are interested in hosting themed events (i.e. craft nights); offer them free membership + revenue share. Basically a way to host way more events, without having to do everything myself

**Value proposition:**

* A comfortable, welcoming third-place to spend time outside of the house
* A fixed cost; monthly dues but no pressure to spend more while you're there (as opposed to a bar, coffee shop, any other third space)
* Ample community events to draw in new members and add value for existing members

  
Thoughts? Feedback? Have you seen this done? I have tried to find some examples and I've mostly just found high-end social clubs and coworking spaces, neither of which match this model I'm considering. ",2,1763749671.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

* Chili Smith Family Foods, 5901 Fair Oaks Blvd. in Carmichael, had eight violations on Wednesday, Nov. 19. The Carmichael chili restaurant was cited by health inspectors due to improper reheating of chili. The handwashing sink in the kitchen was out of paper towels. The restaurant was missing a copy of the food manager’s certificate as well as copies of all the food handlers cards. The restaurant also didn’t have a copy of its most recent inspection report. There were no chlorine test strips. There was a broken refrigerator, and the restroom door was unable to self-close fully. Chili Smith Family Foods had yet to be reinspected as of Thursday, Nov. 20. 



* Folsom Asian supermarket had too-cold food at buffet 99 Ranch Market, 25000 Blue Ravine Road, Suite 10, in Folsom, had two major violations on Wednesday, Nov. 19. Health inspectors cited the Asian supermarket after “potentially hazardous foods” at a dim sum buffet line — shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings and cooked taro — measured too cold to be considered safe. Most of the other foods at the self-service buffet were outside of the temperature range considered safe and lacked proper documentation, according to the Nov. 19 report. The 99 Ranch Market location in Folsom had not been re-inspected as of Thursday afternoon. 



* Sacramento taqueria improperly cooled food El Favorito Taqueria, 2281 Del Paso Road, Suite 100, in Sacramento, had 12 violations on Wednesday, Nov. 19. Health inspectors issued the Mexican restaurant a yellow placard for failing to keep food at safe temperatures and improperly cooling cooked items. Restaurant staff had to discard a container of chicken tomato soup after it did not cool down to a safe temperature in a walk-in refrigerator overnight. A tray of marinated al pastor pork was also thrown away because it was too warm while being stored in a cooler below a griddle. Rice held in a steam table measured more than 25 degrees colder than the temperature range considered safe after it was reportedly reheated in the microwave. Inspectors said staff had no knowledge of reheating food or properly holding hot food. Various foods, including raw eggs, raw shrimp and raw fish, were stored above cooked foods in a walk-in refrigerator. A container of rice in a walk-in was not covered. Three bags of onions were stored on the floor next to a mop sink. A soda machine had black residue in its nozzles, and a meat slicer had food debris on it, according to the report. El Favorito Taqueria had not been re-inspected as of Thursday, Nov. 20.",13,1763749644.0,Sacramento,2,0.93,False

As some of you may already be aware from reading my previous posts ([**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepladiesDesigner/comments/1o9bvup/lets_talk_about_the_gate_general_advice_tips/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepladiesDesigner/comments/1oh4y0g/part_2_lets_talk_about_the_gate_pt_2_huge_haul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I am a BIG fan of DHGate! I think it's convenient, reliable, and I want to spread the word that, YES, you absolutely can get good quality bags there.

So with that, I've seen a few posts recently from people wondering about buying classic Chanel flaps on DHG - and really, the only Chanel flap reviews I ever see are of bags from 187 or Blake or Rome or Genie.

What if I don't want to buy from a TS, or spend like $600 on a bag? Can I still get a good one from somewhere that isn't sketch?

The answer is YES - and I'm going to show you my Classic Flap collection, all purchased on DHG.

Before we begin -

* **I am not a Chanel expert, and I don't claim to be** *(LV yes, Chanel however, no)* so this review IS NOT comparing these bags to the auth versions or seeing how close to ""1:1"" they are, because frankly, I find that shit tedious
* SO - I'm grading these bags on overall quality, workmanship, and details - not how close to auth they are
* My grading criteria is going to be different than yours, because what matters to me may not be as important to you, AND THAT'S OK! Different people value different details
* In fact, I find it pretty hard to nitpick bags. Instead, if you've read reviews from me before, you'll see I go on mainly how the bag ""feels"" - which is subjective and nebulous, and I get that!
* However, I want to caveat that I do own several auth Chanel bags, so I am comparing these to those, but not in a ""let's count stitches"" kinda way

ALSO!

**Please be aware that while I have purchased each of these bags myself at full retail price with my own money, I am sharing affiliate links.**

**What is an affiliate link?** It's a link that is customized to me, so DHG knows that I shared it, and it pays me a commission (1-3% depending on the item) if you buy the item.

**Storytime!** After I posted my last two DHG posts, I got an email from someone at DHG letting me know that my posts had generated almost $10K in sales, and did I want to join their affiliate program. What can I say, Repladies do NOT play when it comes to bags.

So, for every purchase you make on one of the links in this post, I will receive a **1-3%** commission on the sale price of the item, after your item is delivered to you, all of which will go right towards purchasing more bags from new sellers and thus more reviews.

**HOWEVER** \- ***let's be REALLY REALLY crystal fucking clear that I'm NOT doing this for the money***. It's time-consuming as hell writing these, and IF my goal was to make money, there are undoubtedly better ways to do it. I'm def not getting rich here, ok? **It's like $100-$200 bucks TOTAL at the end of the day.**

SO! There's like 6 inches of text, and we haven't seen one bag yet.

**To summarize, before we start, the overall point of this post is:**

* To show that you CAN get good quality bags on DHG, so hopefully one day ""DHG"" will stop being a synonym for ""ugly AF and made of plastic""
* To share DHG sellers that I've found reliable and that can actually deliver the goods, because there are 100s on there and some of them are TERRIBLE and should be avoided at all costs (and that's going to be a post soon, too)

We're going to start with the fun bags before we move into the classic colors, FYI.

This bag ya'll - I literally gasped when I unboxed it. It's GORGEOUS. The suede is lush, soft, and smells so incredible. The hardware is the perfect contrast to the rich color and isn't too yellow. The details are perfect (it's chipped), the quilts have just the right amount of puff, and the lining is buttery soft leather. It's so soft and beautiful that I just can't stop smelling and touching it. I really LOVE a suede bag, and this ticks all of the boxes for me, personally. It feels heavy, like it's a high quality item, not light and flimsy - and that's important to me. I want these bags to feel luxurious when I handle them, like the luxury items they are - not like they're from Walmart. And this bag looks AND feels like a million bucks.

I recently bought a suede Balenciaga city bag, and a suede Gucci softbit (that I ended up rehoming bc it was too big on me) and I've noticed something about suede - if you get a lighter brown color, it can lean towards looking ""cheap"". I don't think this bag would work as well as it does if the brown was a lighter shade.

It's the color, and contrast with the hardware, that really make it look luxe!

The VINTAGE 25cm Classic Flap in Coffee with GHW from LuxurydesignerBags1

**Rating:** 10 Yams / 10

Something about me: I LOVE VINTAGE DESIGNER ANYTHING. I collect auth vintage Hermes scarves, my mom has a killer collection of vintage auth bags that I'm constantly (trying to) steal, and I'm always searching Posh, Depop, TRR, and Vestaire (although...they actually kinda suck) for vintage Tom Ford-era Gucci or Phoebe Philo era Celine.

So when I saw that this seller, who I've bought Chanel bags from before and LOVED (ahem, my [Metiers D'Artes suede shopper](https://sale.dhgate.com/Mm7PMo71), my [top handle also from the 2025 Metiers D'Artes collection](https://sale.dhgate.com/M39s7m17), my [small C25 hobo](https://sale.dhgate.com/nfv25u66) which I'm reviewing next) also had this ""vintage"" Chanel in their store, I didn't hesitate and ordered one so quick my credit card had smoke coming off it.

Also, a confession: I haven't bought a bag from Blake yet. It's just SO HARD for me to justify $500+ on a rep (that's a me problem and you're probably normal and feel differently).

*""But TerribleYam""*, I hear you say, *""Why don't you just buy ONE bag from Blake/187/Rome, instead of 2-3 from DHG?""*

Because I want 2-3 bags instead of one, damnit.

I have no doubt that one day, as a lover of vintage Chanel, I will absolutely become a Blake collector. She makes some beautiful things and I already want them all. But that day is not today! I haven't reached the ""quantity vs quality"" point yet. Not that I don't want quality, but right now, it's quantity. There's too many bags on my wishlist.

So yeah anyways, this ""vintage"" bag.

THE LEATHER ajsasi;j;ifjfiajnfnfifskej8vu.

It's the first (rep) bag I've had that I'm legitimately afraid to scratch, dent, fuck up, etc. I'm ALREADY kicking myself because I originally stored her without pillows inside, and she started to crease (!!!)

But also - I keep reminding myself that it's meant to be a ""vintage"" bag and the best thing about those is the wear and tear and the character they develop over time. Personally, **I think a bag with obvious signs of use and/or flaws looks 100% more authentic than a ""perfect"" one.** That's kind of why people go nuts over slouchy Birkins - same thing.

So, I ADORE this bag, probably a teeny tiny bit more than the suede one, if I'm being completely honest. I love the flat quilts, I love the way it smells, I love the vintage hardware, I love....everything? about it.

I WFH and sometimes I'll just hold it during Zoom calls, ngl.

Oh yeah and I bought a black one too - it's on the way as we speak.

Now, for some color -

A medium 25cm Classic Flap in burgundy caviar leather with GHW, also from LuxuryDesignerBags1

For this bag, since I love burgundy and for me, it will be a ""classic"", I wanted the highest quality I could get that ISN'T 187 or GF. I talked to this seller to ask what the difference was between this bag, and other CF he had that were priced a bit less, and this one is from a better factory and is the ""new"" version. $340 is still pricey, but it's not $500+, so that was just fine for me.

And the bag - it delivers. I love it, and it FEELS luxurious and high-quality. Heavy chain, hardware that isn't yellow, luscious leather smell, soft sooooooft leather (I've noticed that cheap caviar = stiff caviar) this bag has it all! Since I already have a neutral nude CF and a (soon to be two when my vintage arrives) black CF, I wanted a color that I knew I'd get a ton of use out of, but wasn't a ""neutral"", and this bag is perfect. In some lights it's a more vibrant red and in others, it's a rich dark burgundy, which is exactly what I wanted.

10/10, no notes!

Now, these are purchases from a while back, but very much worth reviewing

A beige sheepskin 23cm Classic Flap with GHW, from Angelisdoll16

Oh, I love this bag. My post office LOST IT for almost 10 days (I have a PO Box everything goes to and the tracking said ""placed in box"" but I never got it) and I was about to file a claim when it magically showed up one day! OMG the relief - I felt like someone stole my car and brought it back.

I'm also strictly a caviar girlie, because I think it wears better for an everyday bag, and I also think the rep caviar looks better than sheepskin, on the whole. Sheepskin, in my opinion, is easier to tell if it's lower quality vs caviar. Low quality caviar won't look as ""bad"" as low quality sheepskin will. So, I wouldn't normally have ordered sheepskin from this seller, I probably would have gotten it from the other seller above. But I guess I felt like rolling the dice when I placed this order, because I broke my own rules apparently.

Let's talk about Angelisdoll/GucciBB for a second.

IMHO, this seller is solid for mid-tier bags - not the highest quality you can get, but still good! The prices are more than reasonable for what you get - she offers a ton of colors, and similar pricing on Boy bags (I had one from her that I rehomed that I was super happy with) and C19 bags (want to try one for repscience!).

Another thing about Angelisdoll - you'll notice 90% of her items are priced at $302 - that comes down to $280 (with shipping already included) with an automatic coupon. Some of her items are a really good deal at $280! Others you can find cheaper elsewhere, so do your due diligence!

Back to the review - when I got the bag, I actually didn't love it right away. It felt stiff, the leather felt low quality, and the color was very yellow. In fact, I was debating just rehoming it and buying another from a different seller.

HOWEVER - now that I've conditioned it twice with leather honey, it's seriously grown on me. It REALLY needed conditioning, and now it feels much softer, like good quality leather should. The color has also grown on me, and I realized I was being way too picky. Once I got out of my own head (and saw how great the leather looked post conditioning) I grew to love it. So that's the reason for the -0.25 rating deduction! I will def not be rehoming this.

And lastly, my old favorite

This bag is my bff

I took a 2-3 year break from reps after RIPLadies disappeared. Didn't buy a single rep during that time - EXCEPT for this one

I don't know what demon possessed me that day in September of 2022, but it was post-COVID, my bday was coming up, and I was determined that I was finally going to get a black Jumbo. I tried contacting a few old sellers and quickly discovered that I actually didn't have any current seller contacts lol - so I did what any completely normal person would do, and hopped on DHG for some risky shopping.

I can't remember why I bought this bag specifically out of 100s of other similar listings, but I figured that for the price, I would (hopefully) at least be getting something made out of leather and vaguely resembling a Jumbo CF.

A few weeks later she arrived and I swear to god it felt like I won the lottery, ya'll

Yet another to mention about this seller, Angelisdoll/GucciBB - they ship everything in boxes with the correct color dust bag (white for classics, black for seasonal), the felt protectors for the bag, AND all of the ephemera. That means - a big Chanel book wrapped it glassine, a shopping bag, branded tissue paper, a ribbon & camellia, several receipts in a receipt folder, note cards, etc etc etc. After being out of the rep world, the goodies were fun.

And the bag - I've used this bag more than any other in the past 3 years, and I have to say it's aging beautifully. The leather has gotten softer and more broken in, it's developed some beautiful crinkles, and the shape of the bag has 'relaxed' if that makes any sense. The chain (which is heavy) glides beautifully, and it's looking great for a 3 year old rep. I'm not a person who is ""careful"" with my bags, either - they're meant to be used, and I use them. In fact, I may have even thrown up on my auth speedy on my 21st bday (TMI? It ended up being fine and I still have it lol)

I've also worn this bag into a Chanel boutique and felt completely fine (no side-eye from SAs, and believe me, I'd know - I was one), I've worn it to the bar at the Rosewood Sand Hill, I've worn it to the Lazy Bear, I've worn it to the bar at the Ritz in Tahoe...like, I've def worn it places where auths are and no one blinked twice (also, you're welcome for the mini tour of ""Yam's favorite spots in NorCal for a weekend getaway"")

Like I mentioned earlier, I think bags that show some wear look **WAY MORE auth/believable** than bags that look so perfect, like they just came out of a box.

And I think that's because A). most ""wealthy"" people (at least, the ones I know) who are buying auths are buying them to actually USE them and B). most people don't expect a rep bag to actually age - I think the assumption is that older reps are going look beat to hell and falling apart at the seams, because they're inherently lower quality. So when you see a rep that's actually aged gracefully, I think most people are going to assume it's auth - but that's just my personal opinion/take.

Anyways, eventually I do actually plan to replace this bag with one from 187 (gasp, yes, even after I've shit-talked them this whole review). With the amount of use I get out of this bag, it just makes sense (girl math). But I'll always keep this bag. I'm sentimentally attached now.

**SOOOO - now that we've seen 5 bags from 3 sellers, what's the difference?**

Not much, TBH.

I'm not doing a side by side comparison, but in my humble opinion:

* While still lovely, both CFs from Angelisdoll feel slightly less in quality than the two from LuxuryDesignerBag1 - but I can't put my finger on exactly the reason why?
* If I had to say SOMETHING, I'd say that the Angelisdoll bags construction isn't as good, and the leather quality isn't as good - they're def mid-tier
* THATS NOT TO SAY I DONT LIKE THEM! Mid-tier is just fine for me!
* In fact, I think $249 for a 23cm CF from Angelisdoll is an absolute STEAL and I was gatekeeping this info for literally years lol. I actually plan on ordering a hot pink CF from Angelisdoll, like, tomorrow
* But for classics/neutrals, I would pay the \~$50 more and get the slightly better quality version from LuxuryDeisgnerBags1
* That suede CF is in a class by itself, OK? It's STUNNING
* The factory photos of it on DHG **have the same background** as the factory photos of my brown Vintage CF and you know what that means, ladies! SAME FACTORY!
* For $260, the suede CF is a total no brainer and if you love fall bags, suede bags, and/or Chanel, DO IT

Well, if you've read this far - wow, seriously, thank you. I know I'm very wordy and could have made this much shorter, so thanks for hanging in there until the end.

What's next?

* C25 comparison - XC vs. DHG
* Side trunk comparison - Rainbow Bags vs. TS vs. a $90 DHG version
* Buyer's agents 101 - how to use Superbuy, AllChinaBuy, etc.
* Another Rainbow Bags review - seasonal/fun LV items (Catorgram, mirror, and sequins!)
* Charms and Accessories haul review! Spoiler alert: I'm pretty sure the charms you get from your TS and the ones on DHG come from the same place
* Yes, I do actually have a TS that I love - an Allen haul review

And of course, whatever else you want me to write about, I will! Just let me know. If you can't tell, I LOVE BAGS, so no, I don't mind spending 3+ hours on these. I could talk/write about bags all day.

Let me know what other questions about DHG I can answer to de-mystify it and encourage more people to try it out - and if you buy anything I recommend, I want to see a review!!! Share with the rest of the class, please.

Also, we can't end without updated versions of these!

Any day now...

Once I shared my coffee pictures with some friends and they suggested maybe I should get into some kind of home barista content creation. I love this idea but since I’m into my career building phase I’m confused should I pursue the thing that makes me happy. 

Would love your honest suggestions.

He's visiting me from out of state this week and while walking around at Menards (which he doesn't have in his home state), he mentioned that, at home, he refills and uses soda bottles for his water. For Christmas, I'd like to get him something decent to enjoy his water from and figured I'd ask here since I'm more of a coffee guy and don't often drink water (and when I do, it's just from a glass or a disposable water bottle).

I don't think he'd care much for something like a Stanley cup or Yeti tumbler and would most likely prefer something basic, though I'd want it to (obviously) be reusable, durable, and easy to clean. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I could get him? Price isn't really an issue, though obviously I'm not going to pay anything unreasonable for a bottle (and he'd kill me if I did!). Thanks for any suggestions! (Also open to other suggestions too -- I'm going to get him more than *just* a water bottle, of course.)",2,1763749247.0,GiftIdeas,6,1.0,False
1p363tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1p363tu/has_anyone_else_noticed_a_difference_stacking/,Has anyone else noticed a difference stacking L-theanine with a nootropic blend vs taking it alone?,"I've been taking L-theanine by itself for a few months (usually 200mg in the morning with coffee) and it definitely helps smooth out the caffeine jitters. But I recently started taking it alongside Mind Lab Pro instead of solo, and I swear the focus effects are way more pronounced now. I'm wondering if it's just placebo or if there's actually some synergy happening with the other ingredients? Like, does citicoline or the other stuff in comprehensive formulas actually enhance what L-theanine does, or am I just imagining things? Anyone else experimented with this? I'm curious if stacking works better than individual supplements or if I'm just wasting money on the combo. Thanks",5,1763749203.0,NooTopics,0,1.0,False
