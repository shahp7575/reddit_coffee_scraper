1m0sedo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1m0sedo/they_followed_me_into_the_woods/,They Followed Me into the Woods,"I pour myself a fresh cup of coffee. I set the pot on the back end of the fire.

I'm getting to the age where I make noises every time I get up or sit down.

Getting older means things don’t work like they used to.

I used to need to come out here once a month.

Now it’s only once a year.

Lots of clouds out this evening.

Suddenly I hear a noise—

The unmistakable sound of a twig snap under a human foot.

It’s too dark to see far into the trees.

There shouldn’t be people this far out.

That’s why I come here.

My heart starts to quicken.

I don’t want anyone to get hurt.

“Hello?” I throw into the darkness.

I beam my flashlight around where I think I heard the noise.

A plastic lamb mask smiles at me from a space in the trees before it disappears.

Another noise—bushes being disturbed, but on the opposite side.

I search with my light for the source.

I discover another glowing lamb face, this time in an elongated frown.

The sun shrinks away from us behind the clouds.

The shadows gain strength.

I read about these guys.

People go missing.

Their bodies turn up somewhere decapitated, a picture pinned on.

These guys posing with the head.

News calls them ""Comedy and Tragedy""

Did they follow me out here?

That’s a long way to murder an old man.

Unless they didn’t want to be interrupted.

Nobody would hear me scream.

It’s smart.

That was my plan too.

The sun is gone.

Off to bed.

I saw a break in the clouds.

“You need to leave!” I yell.

They all step into the illumination of my dying fire.

I take my wallet and throw it at them.

“Take my money. Just go home!”

They step past it.

I bolt into the forest,

Hopping over small bushes and plowing through the larger.

I can hear them chasing me.

I reach an uphill slope.

This would have been easy 20 years ago.

I start to climb.

I need to put as much distance between them and me as possible.

Time is running out.

I’m halfway to the top,

Breathing heavy.

It’s starting.

They’re still pursuing me.

They have age as an ally.

“Just leave me alone!” I howl at them.

I can see at least one of them has a knife.

The clouds are slowly dispersing,

And the starlight gives me enough light to reach the summit.

My skin burns.

Sweat drenches my clothes.

I try to run more,

I don’t get far until I collapse.

I can feel my heartbeat through my body—like I’m sitting on a bass drum.

They reach the top.

“Go, please now… You’re all going to die.”

The clouds fade, revealing the full moon.

My bones crunch and reform bigger.

My skull stretches.

My teeth lengthen to a sharp point.

I tried to warn them.

Tried to run.

Now I’m reborn—

With fur,

With claws,

And hunger.

1m0sdx0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0sdx0,LV × Murakami CarryAll PM M13661 Review: The Art Collector's Daily Bag (Spoiler: It’s a Walking Gallery!),"Hey Reddit fam! As a longtime Murakami art lover, I finally caved and snagged the Louis Vuitton × Murakami CarryAll PM (M13661) — the 2025 re-edition of the iconic collab. After using it nonstop for a month, here’s my brutally honest take for anyone eyeing this psychedelic masterpiece.

First, the ART speaks LOUDER than hype:Design & Materials: The ""Thirty-Three Colors"" Monogram canvas is pure eye candy 🎨. Each panel feels like a mini Murakami painting, while the plush velvet leather trim (in matching rainbow hues!) adds a luxe tactile touch. The detachable butterfly charm and gold hardware? Chef’s kiss for whimsy.

Size & Practicality (29x24x12 cm): Shockingly spacious! Holds my iPad Mini, oversized wallet, makeup pouch, keys, AND a small water bottle. The detachable zip pouch (doubles as a clutch!) is perfect for quick errands, and the interior organization (2 slip pockets + zip compartment) keeps chaos at bay.

Why it’s worth the splurge:Art Meets Street Cred: This bag turns heads. Paired with all-black outfits? Instant pop. With summer florals? Vibes for days. The white base makes colors glow without being garish.

Functional Magic: Adjustable strap (fits my 5’2” frame perfectly) + top handles = 3 carrying modes. The magnetic closure is secure yet silent—no fumbling at coffee shops! .

Low-Key Exclusivity: Limited re-release = fewer sightings than classic monogram. Feels special without screaming ""hypebeast"".Delicate Elements: The velvet trim will show dust/friction marks. I avoid denim and use a dust bag religiously.

Color Commitment: Not for minimalists—but if you love art, it’s a forever statement.

Verdict? A functional art piece.If you want a bag that sparks joy AND carries your life, this collab delivers. 9/10 (minus 1 for velvet anxiety 😅).

Q’s for you all:

Anyone else own this? How’s the velvet holding up?

1m0scf9,https://i.redd.it/ub2iv90vh3df1.jpeg,Teeth staining? Unknown cause/prevention,"A couple of years ago I suddenly started getting really bad teeth staining. Nothing in my lifestyle changed - I don't drink or smoke, don't drink coffee, just one tea with milk a day. The only thing I can think of is that it was when I got new retainers to sleep in; they were quite tight when I first got them, so I'm wondering if it left micro cracks in the enamel or something? I'd always had very good bright teeth before that and often got compliments on my smile, but now they're really stained :(

I still have good actual dental health, both my dentist and hygienist agree it's a cosmetic problem rather than anything else and that I'm not doing anything wrong in terms of cleaning/care. It does go away with airflow, but I hate the procedure (and the $120 cost) and it only lasts about 3 months before it's just as stained as before. I'm wary of most 'whitening' treatments as I really don't want to damage the enamel. I already have sensitive teeth (I use Sensodyne because all the other sensitive brands seem to use SLS which give me ulcers).

Is there anything I can do? My dentist has been kind of vague whenever I've asked. I know it's more important to have Healthy teeth but I feel really self conscious about it. Could it have been caused by a retainer, or just an age thing?",1,1752610174.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1m0scap,https://i.redd.it/p77r1kguh3df1.jpeg,Rich Espresso,"Okay, someone tell me ab the Rich Espresso perfume. Is it supposed to belong with the Coco Shea Espresso body care products? I’ll admit I haven’t been into a BBW to just peruse around or shop for myself in years. So maybe it’s normal, but why would they name the products different (Rich Espresso vs Coco Shea Espresso) if they seemingly go together (basing this on packaging alone)? Just to say they contain coco butter/shea butter? Idk if they even contain those ingredients tbh. 

Also, I’m new to fragrance and layering- What are yall layering the Rich Espresso perfume with, if not with the Coco Shea Espresso body care? Would it be weird to pair it with Milk? I’m thinking maybe a ‘cafe con leche’ vibe? Or is it too “cereal milk” sweet for that? 

Context: I am not a fan of the typical “winter” or “night time” fragrances. Can’t stand the sweet gourmands that are like a bakery item or candy, and almost always dislike sensual/sexy frags. But I quite like coffee. So was thinking I could somehow make that my winter fragrance, but wasn’t sure if it was too “black coffee” by itself.

A 25-year-old gurlie here who is perpetually tired as my days are long, and my tasks are endless. Have had a few attempts at dating but most seem to underestimate the toxicity of my schedule. I make time for things and people that matter, no matter how little my control over my time is.

Instead of fancy night-outs, I would rather we have cozy days and nights instead where we watch animes, read and discuss books, and discover new coffee shops together. We can even go shopping together if you are also into collecting toys and trinkets.

A little bit more about me: physical-wise, I don’t think I am ugly naman? I have been called cute before pero baka out of courtesy charot. I am also not petite nor thin. I stand at 5’4” and I weigh extra. I’m trying to lose some of the weight but I understand it’s a process so I don’t stress myself too much over it. I reside somewhere in Quezon City (pero hindi sa Farview I swear). If you got any questions, just ask away!

About you: Someone decent and ready for a commitment. If you’re someone who would only “want to try”, then I’d rather you save ourselves from the trouble hehe. Taller and older is good, too, but I definitely wouldn’t mind if you are my age or my height (or even shorter). I work in healthcare so it’d be nice if you do, too.

We've been friend since we were 10. We used to be best friends but we drifted apart when she moved aboard for college and studies. I have nothing against her, it just that we have nothing in common right now. I've been coming more religious and reserved while she's becoming the complete opposite. We both come from a Muslim background so now I'll label us childhood friends more than current best friends. I still deeply care about her and I hope it's the same for me.
She has a friend let's call her Jane (30 F). Since day one I noticed that the vibes were weird. Long story short, she told me that she's BI and and dated Jane for a while. Now she lives with Jane in the US and consider her as her bestfriend. 
Sarah came to our country two years ago and suggested we do a little weekend getaway. From day one I declared that due to religious reasons ( not here to debate on that )  I don't feel comfortable to be in a sitting with drinking..She assured she's not planning to have more than a glass or two in a restaurant. Something she ended up being drunk, invited also her cousin ( Male ) and sister to stay with us. They were drinking and smoking weed in the apartment. I felt blindsided and unsafe. I locked myself in the room all night and left first thing in the morning the other day. Months later she apologized.
A month ago Sarah came to visit. We went out for sushi date and I ended up paying for us because they didn't accept card payment and I had extra cash on me. She told me she'll travel for a month and when she'll be back to town she'll invite me.I was like sure. 
It's been about 10 days she's posting on Instagram that she's back. She made coffee, brunch plans with her sister and played tourist for two days with her friend Jane. She also came to town apparently. She didn't text or anything. Now I just got a text from her saying let's go for Sushi tomorrow night and she's leaving after tomorrow.

1m0sbuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1m0sbuc/day_1_0mg_after_2_week_taper/,Day 1 (0mg) After 2 Week Taper,"I’ll try to keep this brief. I was a heavy user, I calculated about 50-80mg daily. I began my quitting process 2 weeks ago. I opted for NRT because the daily dosage was so dangerously high. I used a combination of Zyn 6mg, Zyn 3mg, and nicorette gum 4mg. The logic behind this approach was to reduce the overall nicotine levels, break the hand to mouth habits, and ease into longterm habits.

Day 1: I allowed myself to consume as much as I though I needed to keep the urges at bay, 36 mg consumed: 5 Zyn 6mg and 2 gum 4mg.

Day 2/3:

Reduced intake down to 28 mg

Day 4/5: still consuming the same amount of nicotine as a pack a day smoker. Some minor withdrawal effects but nothing crazy down to 21 mg.

Day 6/7: started to get withdrawals as I actively had to fight cravings and put off consuming. End of day 7 is 16mg.

Day 8/9: had a slip up here, moved across state lines and had a 1000 mile drive. Consumed 22mg on the 8th, back to 16 on the 9th. Definitely experiencing some withdrawal symptoms: gas, headache, sweats, irritability.

Day 10/11: things are getting better, it’s easier to resist the urges. Down to 12 mg.

Day 12/13: we are dosing in single digits now. We weakened the beast and are ready to go for the kill. 6mg at the end of day 13 (2 Zyn 3mg)

Day 14/15: 0mg. Still have trigger cravings like coffee, full after meal, driving. But I know I’m almost free. In another 2 weeks I won’t have a trace of this demon drug in my system and I will never touch it again.

Tapering can work, you have to be consistent and honest with yourself. If you struggle to accurately count calories, maybe this isn’t the way for you. I went from a lethal dose of nicotine to zero. Tapering helped me form new habits to replace the old and the method really helped break the hand to mouth habits. Good luck everyone!

1m0sb0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m0sb0k/discover_if_the_mecity_kc101_coffee_maker/,Discover if the Mecity KC101 Coffee Maker Delivers a Perfect Cup Every Time Review,"The Mecity KC101 Coffee Maker 3 in 1 Single Serve Machine intrigued me when I first heard about it. I’ve been a coffee lover for years, so finding a versatile, modern solution for my daily brewing rituals was exciting. The 3-in-1 compatibility with K-Cup capsules, instant coffee, and loose tea fit perfectly into my multi-beverage household routines.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Sliding this coffee maker out of the box, my first thought was how compact and sleek it looked. Its silver and black finish blended seamlessly into my modern kitchen. At just 10.6"" in depth and 6.3"" in width, it parked on my limited counter space as though it was custom-built to fit there. The stainless-steel accents enhance its robust feel while the BPA-free components gave me peace of mind for long-term usage. And, at only 4.6 pounds, moving it around wasn’t a chore.

[Grab Mecity KC101 Coffee Maker deals on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09x1shwmg/)

**Brewing Performance**  
After adding water to the 50-ounce removable reservoir, the brewing process was as simple as hitting a button. The machine's 6, 8, and 10-ounce brewing options let me customize my drink sizes seamlessly. I found this particularly useful when switching between a quick espresso shot or prepping a more indulgent cup of tea in a larger mug. Each brew took just 60-100 seconds—a feature that made my busy mornings smoother. Its built-in smart flow management system nailed a consistent taste, eliminating the trial-and-error “too strong” or “too weak” outcomes.

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker screamed user-friendly right out of the box. Its interface is intuitive—even my technologically challenged mother was able to operate it effortlessly during one visit. The detachable filter basket and drip tray made cleaning pain-free, and the descaling alert system was a welcome feature for those of us who often forget regular maintenance. I tested out its vinegar-cleaning method for descaling, and it worked like a charm. Hit the button, and off it went; no manual finagling required!

**Positives**  
What stood out during my experience was how this machine packed convenience into every corner:  
- Compact design takes up minimal counter space.  
- BPA-free, safe for everyday use.  
- Brewing tea or coffee is equally simple without a separate kettle.  
- Speedy brewing time perfect for rushed mornings.  

**Shortcomings**  
However, not everything about this coffee maker is flawless. A few aspects left room for improvement:  
- The buttons felt a tad flimsy, possibly reducing long-term durability.  
- I couldn’t brew superlarge mugs unless I poured twice or replaced cups mid-process.  
- Water splashes around the drip tray slightly if the maximum level isn’t aligned.  

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to some other single-serve machines like the Keurig K-Mini or Nespresso Essenza Mini, this unit differentiates itself with its ability to brew loose tea alongside coffee pods. While the Keurig offers a larger range for pod exclusivity and minimal maintenance, the Mecity KC101 excels in price point and versatility for multi-beverage households. It even outdoes the Nespresso Essenza Mini in capacity, thanks to its 50-ounce water reservoir versus Essenza’s much smaller tank, but sacrifices the ultra-fine frothing capability Nespresso fans might expect.

**Value Proposition**  
This coffee maker certainly provides compelling value for money. Its all-in-one design saves the need for a separate kettle or specialty brewers, and it’s moderately energy-efficient to boot. Though it isn’t the cheapest model in the market, it offers more range for a household that enjoys variety in hot beverages. Occasionally splurging on convenience like this one feels like a smart investment without breaking the bank.

so… not to be dramatic but last year was hell. like “everything hurts and i’m losing my mind and also my body is rebelling and the universe is on mute” kind of year. -10/10 would not recommend. i was running on panic, caffeine, and a suspicious amount of stubbornness.

and now… somehow?? i live with my girlfriend. earlier than planned but that’s ok (thank you cost of living). we have a whole little apartment filled with sunlight, too many mugs, and a questionable amount of plants (none of which are leaving, sorry lex). we laugh a lot. we’re building something slow and intentional and kind. and no one’s yelling. no one’s leaving. and it finally feels like home… i can finally breathe.

i wake up and i’m not dreading the day. i laugh more. i cry less (or at least when i do cry it’s not always panic lol… sometimes it’s just feelings and i survive them and move on, oddly enough). i’ve made it through so many hard things and now, for once, life is soft. i’m finally learning a kinder way to say my own name.

i still have hard days. i still spiral sometimes. but now i spiral in a home that smells like coffee and has love in the corners. and i come back to myself quicker. i don’t know, i’m just… proud. and a little stunned. like, how did i get here? how did things go from everything being on fire to this much peace? but they did. and i’m so grateful.

my circle is very small right now. i’m trying to be intentional about the people i allow access to my little world… so i guess, the point of this post is to celebrate the wins and invite others to celebrate with me. life is really good. 🌻

I wasn’t exactly looking for love, but curiosity got the better of me. The idea that someone behind bars might want to connect with people on the outside felt kinda wild but also human in a weird way.

I ended up messaging this guy who was doing time for a non-violent drug offense. His profile was surprisingly thoughtful. He wrote poetry, talked about books he’d read inside, and even mentioned how he missed the smell of fresh coffee. We exchanged a few letters (yeah, real mail), and he was polite, funny, and honestly more grounded than some of the dudes I’ve met on Tinder. No weird pressure or love bombing, just actual conversations.

That said, I started to feel weird about it after a few weeks. I was worried I might be getting too emotionally involved with someone whose real life I didn’t fully understand. Plus, I had no idea how common scams are on those sites, or if people pretend to be someone else. I didn’t send money or anything, but I still got a bit anxious.

Has anyone else gone down this rabbit hole? Do these sites ever lead to real relationships or is it mostly just bad news waiting to happen? Curious to hear what others have experienced.",1,1752609949.0,casualdating,0,1.0,False

The morning sun burned through the blinds. I was drenched in sweat, the taste of copper thick in my mouth. I wiped my lips and stared at the red stain on my palm. Nosebleed. I staggered to the bathroom and turned on the light. My face looked like I hadn’t slept in days; dark bags, blood crusted to my upper lip, skin pale. My shirt was sticking to me like I’d been rained on. I pulled it off, eyes closed as my eyes burned with exhaustion. I looked up to the mirror, stopping in my tracks.  Across my chest; scratches. Long, red, fresh. I hadn’t had them when I went to bed. The phone rang suddenly. I jumped, staring at it for a moment before walking over. I picked it up slowly, as if it might explode in my hand. “Byrne?” Clancy’s voice came through, low, uneasy. “Yeah… yeah, I’m here,” “There’s something you need to see. It’s about the kid. The one we found in the woods.” I swallowed, my throat dry. “What is it?” “They finished the toxicology. No drugs, no alcohol. But there were marks... strange symbols carved into his back. Looked like rope burns at first but... these weren’t random.” “What kind of symbols?” I asked. “I don’t know. Some kind of runes, maybe. Not anything I’ve seen before. You need to come down here,” He finished, sighing over the phone.  I didn’t answer right away. I looked over my shoulder, half-expecting the noose to be hanging in my hallway. “I’ll be there in twenty,” I told him as I cleared my throat.  I didn’t even change clothes. I threw on a jacket, grabbed my badge, and got in the car. The whole way to the station I kept checking my rearview mirror. Every time I did, it felt like someone would be sitting in the backseat, watching. Nothing was there. But it felt like something was. When I got to the precinct, Clancy was already waiting for me in the back hallway, a folder clutched to his chest. “You look like shit,” he said, flatly. “I feel worse,” I grunted. He handed me the folder with a worried expression.  “Tell me if I’m losing it,” he said, watching me as I opened it. Photos; close-ups of the victim’s back. Long, jagged marks, like rope, had been wrapped tight and then seared into the skin. But some of the marks were... deliberate. Etched. I traced one of them with my finger over the plastic sleeve. “I’ve seen this before,” I whispered. Clancy looked up. “Where?” “In my dream. Last night.” He stared at me. “You remember that guy you questioned, Cian?” he asked slowly. “Yeah,” I responded.  “He was talking about the marks before he bled out. Said they were ‘part of the pact.’ Whatever that means,” He shrugged. I closed the folder, heart pounding. “He said I started something. Something I don’t understand,” I told him.  Clancy nodded. “Well, maybe you should try,” “What do you mean?” He glanced around the hallway, then leaned in close. “You ever heard of the Black Knot?” He asked quietly, almost whispering.  “No,” I replied, confused.  “It’s folklore. Real obscure shit. Came up in some files I pulled after the first incident. Some old Celtic ritual about binding souls. Hanging trees. Spirits trapped in the noose. People who touch it become... marked,” I blinked. “Marked how?” Clancy took a step back. “They belong to it now,” Silence filled the hallway. Then a deputy came running up, face pale. “Clancy. Byrne. We’ve got another one,” We both turned. “Where?” Clancy asked. The deputy swallowed, glancing at me before answering. “Outside Byrne’s house.” Clancy didn’t say much on the drive over. The cruiser hummed beneath us, tires slicing through wet asphalt as we moved past rows of quiet houses. I sat stiffly, head leaning against the passenger window, trying to focus on the rain as it painted lines across the glass. My stomach twisted with something deep, something sour and heavy. “You good?” Clancy asked, eyes still on the road. “I’m fine,” I lied, voice low. He looked over, making a double-take as he furrowed his brow.  “Your nose is bleeding,” He uttered.  I wiped it with the back of my hand, blinking at the smear of red across my skin. I didn’t respond. Clancy turned onto my street, slowing to a crawl as the yellow tape came into view. A couple of cruisers were already parked in front of my house, red and blue lights quietly rotating in the misty gray of the morning. He parked behind one of them, and I opened the door slowly, my legs stiff as I stepped out. The second I stood up, my stomach lurched. I doubled over and threw up in the gutter; thick, wet heaves that burned my throat. It wasn’t food. It was dark. Too dark. It tasted of metal and dirt.  Clancy came around to my side of the car, watching me. “You sure this is just stress?” he asked. “I said I’m fine,” I snapped, coughing and wiping my mouth with my sleeve. We crossed the lawn. It felt wrong, like stepping into someone else’s home. Deputies were gathered near the tree in my backyard. One of them looked over at me and immediately looked away. Clancy pushed ahead, motioning for me to follow. “You’re not gonna like this,” one of the officers mumbled to Clancy as we passed. We stepped into the backyard. That damn oak tree stood tall in the mist, its limbs stretched wide like arms waiting for something. Hanging from one of the thicker branches was a body. The noose creaked with every soft breeze. I froze. At first glance, it looked like me. Same build. Same height. Same slumped posture, head tilted slightly to the side. My heart stopped for a second. I couldn’t breathe, a hand to my chest was the only thing keeping my heart from bursting out of my chest. My vision flattened once more, ears ringing. But as we got closer, I realized it wasn’t me. Younger, maybe early twenties. Messy brown hair matted with blood. Wearing a torn gray hoodie, soaked and stained. One sneaker missing. Wrists wrapped in old, deep ligature marks like he’d been tied up before the end. “Do we have an ID?” Clancy asked, stepping toward the body. “Not yet,” one of the deputies said. “Neighbor called it in about an hour ago. Said he thought he saw Mark walking into the yard sometime around four. Then I saw the body hanging around six.” Clancy glanced at me. I couldn’t move. My hands were shaking, my stomach turning again. My head pulsed like something inside was knocking to get out. I cleared my throat, feeling bile creep up the back of my esophagus. “Why does he look like me?” I asked quietly. Clancy didn’t answer. The body hung still now, like the wind had gone dead. Something on the ground caught Clancy’s eye. He crouched down, motioning for a flashlight. One of the deputies handed it over, and he clicked it on, sweeping the beam across the damp dirt. Symbols. Carved crudely into the mud. Long spirals. Crossed lines. Circles with small hooks like teeth curling out from their edges. “Same markings from the crime scene in the woods,” Clancy muttered. I stumbled forward, nausea rising again. I dropped to my knees, coughing into my hands. This time, when I looked down, I saw more than just blood; thick, black threads swimming in my spit like oil in water. I sat back on my heels, trying to breathe. The body was still swinging gently above us. I looked up. Something was carved into the branch, Just above where the noose was tied.

BYRNE

I stared. “I didn’t do that,” I said. “I know,” Clancy responded, but he didn’t sound convinced. And for a second, I wasn’t either.  I didn’t say much after that. Clancy talked with the forensics guy, muttered something about getting someone from State to look at the symbols. I just stood there, swaying slightly, trying not to vomit again. My stomach was cramping hard now, like something inside was twisting tighter with every breath I took. We left after an hour. Clancy drove this time too. Said I was in no shape to be behind the wheel, not that I argued. I leaned against the window, eyes half-lidded, watching the world bleed past. Everything looked distant. Too slow. Like I was watching it all through a thick layer of glass. We didn’t speak until we got back to the station. I sat on the edge of Clancy’s desk while he typed into the system, pulling up old case files and cross-referencing the symbols. I took off my jacket, my arms were burning under the sleeves. Like sunburn, but worse. Like fire just beneath the skin. I rolled up my sleeves, stopped breathing. There were lines on my arms. Thin, red scratches. Some shallow, some deeper. Fresh. Like they’d been carved while I was asleep. I touched one and flinched. It stung. “Clancy,” I said, voice low. He didn’t look up. “Yeah?” “Clancy,” I repeated sternly.  He turned and saw my arms. “Jesus, Mark. When did that happen?” “I don’t know,” I whispered. He stepped closer, inspecting the marks like he wasn’t sure if they were real. “They’re… they’re the same shapes. Same as in the dirt,” he said slowly. “Look.” He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out one of the printed photos from earlier that morning. He held it next to my arm. The curve of the spiral. The hooked teeth. The slash marks. All of it; identical. “Mark, what the hell is happening to you?” “I don’t know,” I said again, shaking my head. He stared at me, searching my face for something, some clue, maybe some lie. But there wasn’t anything left to hide. I was falling apart right in front of him. I rolled the sleeve back down and leaned forward, elbows on my knees, pressing my palms against my eyes until everything turned white. “I think it’s the noose,” I said finally. Clancy sat back down in his chair. “What do you mean?” “I mean, it did something. I touched it, and it… took something from me. Or gave something. I don’t know. But ever since then… the dreams, the guy at the hospital, the attack… this thing on my skin. It’s all tied to that moment.” He was quiet for a long time. Then he stood up, grabbed his coat, and tossed mine at me. “Let’s go,” he said. “Go where?” “To the forest,” We parked at the edge of the Clove Hoof trailhead. The sky had darkened again, gray clouds rolling in like a slow bruise. Wind whipped through the trees, cold and sharp. I stepped out of the car, legs unsteady, every movement feeling like it was being resisted, like something didn’t want me back here. We walked the trail in silence, Clancy holding a flashlight, even though it was still early afternoon. The trees bent in above us, forming a loose canopy that darkened everything underneath. I started sweating. Hard. My breath came short. My legs dragged. Clancy looked over, concern flashing in his eyes. “You’re white as hell, man.” I didn’t answer. We reached the tree again. The oak in the middle of all those redwoods. The only one of its kind. The branch the noose had hung from was still there, bare, scarred with old rope burns. The grass beneath it had been trampled, muddy and dark. Clancy stepped forward, sweeping the flashlight around the base of the tree. “There,” he pointed. “Markings. Again.” More symbols. More spirals. Fresh, still wet. “I think it’s a language,” he said softly. “Or a warning.” “Or a curse,” I muttered. He turned to look at me. I was gripping my stomach. Blood was coming from my nose again, faster now, and the back of my throat tasted like pennies and rust. I pulled up my sleeve. The markings were spreading. Now across my shoulder, down to my wrist. And they were moving. Clancy backed up a step. “Okay. Okay. We need help. Like real help.” I sank to my knees. I was freezing and sweating at the same time. My vision blurred. I could feel something crawling just beneath my skin. I looked up at Clancy, eyes wide. “I think it wants me dead, Clance.” He stepped toward me, gripping my shoulders tightly. “No. Fuck that. We’re going to figure this out, alright? We’ll find out what this is. We’ll find who started it. We’re not letting you die like this.” I looked past him. Just behind the tree. There was someone standing there. Tall. Thin. Barefoot. Soaked in mud and shadow. Head tilted too far to the left. Watching us. Not moving.I opened my mouth to speak, but my throat locked up. My hands trembled. Clancy turned to see what I was staring at, but the figure was already gone. He didn’t say anything right away, just stared at the empty space behind the tree, flashlight beam trembling slightly in his hand. “You saw something,” he said finally. I nodded, slow. “It was watching us.” I choked out.  “Was it… human?” I hesitated. “Mostly.” Clancy cursed under his breath and turned back to me.  “Alright, we’re done out here. I don’t care if we have to call in every spook from Langley to fucking Vatican City. You’re not dying in this goddamn forest.” He hauled me up, my legs barely cooperating. My vision swam, but I followed him as best I could. The woods felt alive now, pressing closer, the trees leaning in, the wind whispering in a voice that wasn’t quite wind. I could hear something. Not words. More like humming. Low. Wrong. Like the world itself was remembering something it wanted to forget. We were almost to the car when I collapsed again. My knees buckled and I hit the dirt hard, coughing violently. I doubled over and vomited something thick and black, steaming in the cold air. Clancy was shouting, but it sounded far away. Then; Everything went quiet. Not silent. Quiet. The kind that feels like the air has been sucked out of the world. Like something’s holding its breath.I looked up. The trees were still. The clouds above had frozen mid-drift. And in front of me, kneeling now in the dirt, was the figure. Closer. Clearer. Its eyes were hollow, dark pits, but I felt it looking at me. It reached out a hand, long-fingered, the nails black and cracked like old bark. It touched my chest. And I remembered something that wasn’t mine. A rope. A fire. A name screamed into the woods until the voice gave out. Pain. So much pain. I gasped, sucking in breath like I’d been underwater for days. The figure was gone again. Vanished without sound or trace. But the symbols on my skin? They were glowing now. Faint red light, pulsing like a heartbeat. I yelled out in a searing pain, clawing at the marks as they burned and singed my skin. Clancy hauled me up, panicked now. “Mark, Jesus, we’re going now.” I didn’t argue. My head lolled as he half carried me back to the car.  Back at the station, I sat wrapped in a blanket, a cup of coffee going cold in my hands. Clancy was pacing, phone to his ear, shouting into it. He’d called in favors. Old friends. Experts. Anyone who might know what the hell we were dealing with. I stared at my reflection in the darkened window. My eyes looked wrong. Too wide. Too still. The thing in the forest had left something in me. And I wasn’t sure it ever meant to leave.

Here’s the situation:

This past weekend I (29NB) visited a city I used to live in around 6 years ago. I currently live in another city about 4 hours away. While I was there, I happened to reconnect with someone (28M) I had known when I lived there. We actually had brief flirty vibes yearss ago but it fizzled out and never really amounted to anything beyond a really nice low stakes friendship. We have followed each other on social media for the years after I moved away - this weekend d agreed to get coffee in the morning before I left. 

When we grab coffee he invites me to see his apartment and we spend the morning catching up, flirting, laughing and being very touchy. I’m honestly so surprised as it happening that we have such good chemistry. We both make statements here and there about him coming to visit me sometime or us making future plans to see each other again. At one point he offers to lend me a camera for a trip I have soon, knowing that we’d have to see each other again for me to get it back to him (I’m an idiot and said no thank you). At the end we hug which eventually turns to kissing (I initiated) and it’s all super cute and sweet and surprising. He tells me I can stay with him if/when I ever visit the city again, and then we parted ways and I went home. 

I sent him a follow up message saying I’d love to send him a letter/postcard sometime and he sent me his address. But honestly I can’t get that morning out of my head! I’m realistic in the sense that it feels fleeting and just like a little fling, but part of me feels so embarrassingly eager to make plans to see him again. How soon would you reach out to suggest plans? Would you be freaked out if your random long distance friend who you haven’t seen in years suddenly wanted to make plans to see you again? Should I wait until he reaches out first? Very fearful that he isn’t romanticizing it in the same way, so shooting my shot feels crazy. 

Basically I don’t want to get overly ambitious over something that didn’t mean anything or seem like an obsessed freak, but it’s been a long time since I felt such a fun connection. What would you do!",1,1752609823.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Just looking for some honest feedback on this. I (23M) dated my ex — let’s call her Emily — for about 9–10 months. When we were together, I was 23 and she was 20. It’s now been about a year and two months since we broke up, so we’re both a year older and in different places in life.

The last time we saw each other was mid-June last year, and she still sent me a birthday gift by mail in early July, which was honestly really thoughtful. I never replied to it — not because I didn’t care, but because I didn’t know how to process it emotionally and kind of shut down. That was the last time we had any contact.

I was the one who ended things, but not because I stopped caring. We were just dealing with a lot of distance and life changes. She was two hours away at school, and I had just started a new job. The new job was 7–4, but with commuting, my gym routine, showering, and needing to be in bed by 9:30/10, it felt like there was no time in the day. Before that job, I had Wednesdays off and every other weekend, so I was able to make time to see her — but with the new schedule and her being away, it all started to feel like we were drifting. On top of that, some friends were in my ear about the relationship, and I think that clouded my judgment more than I realized at the time.

Since the breakup, I’ve seen a few people casually, but nothing has matched the emotional connection or happiness I felt with her. We didn’t have a ton of surface-level things in common (like music or media), but she was one of the kindest, most genuine people I’ve ever been with. I’ve thought about her on and off throughout the whole year — not in a desperate or obsessive way, but consistently. There have been a few times where I even thought about mailing her a letter, but I kept stopping myself, thinking maybe I needed more time or didn’t want to reopen something she worked hard to move on from.

Now that some time has passed, I’m starting a new shift at the same job — 8–5 instead of 7–4 — and the location is much closer to home. It’s not a huge difference, but it gives me more balance, and I don’t feel as rushed or burned out. She also moved back to her hometown, which is now only 45 minutes to an hour away.

Lately I’ve been wondering if it would be okay to just reach out and ask her to get coffee — no expectations, no pressure. I genuinely just want to see how she’s been. I’m not reaching out just to get her back, but I also wouldn’t be opposed to the idea if something naturally sparked again. That said, I’d completely understand if she’s moved on or wants nothing to do with me.

I’ve grown a lot this past year — I’ve learned to sit with my emotions, reflect on my decisions, and not run from uncomfortable truths. I’m just trying to approach this with honesty and maturity. My only fear is disturbing her peace or bringing up feelings she’s already made peace with.

Would really appreciate any advice on whether reaching out — after this much time — is a respectful move or if I should just keep this to myself and let it go.

Thanks.

Naturally, I tell my trusted friend about it, we will call her Tam. Tam kind of brushes it off. After thinking on it for a while (as it’s a huge commitment, and lots of $$$) I decide to purchase a vintage camper to renovate. When i tell Tam that i’ve purchased a camper, the very next day she suddenly “comes up” with this idea all on her own and acted like she forgot about my camper she says “didn’t you say you were going to do a coffee truck?” and she EVEN ASKED IF I WANTED TO WORK FOR HER!!!! i brush it off thinking she’s just talking, surely she won’t buy a camper/trailer for a while since this isn’t the kind of thing you impulse buy.. a day later i’m at work at a local coffee shop and her father comes in and says he’s going to pick up a trailer for Tam i’m baffled by this. I didn’t even say anything to Tam till she texts me saying “sorry for LOWKEY copying you.. I feel KINDA bad.” I then tell her that i was honestly pretty upset about it as i trusted her. She then proceeds to go NUTS saying things like “WHAT!!! i didn’t copy you! you just INSPIRED me!” I begin to ignore Tam. Then she takes it a step forward by having her mom message my mom!! (WE ARE 19!) So in order to get Tams mom to leave my poor mother alone i make amends with her. But it gets worse. Ili gets to renovating her coffee truck and goes (allegedly, from a friend of hers): $15,000 in credit card debt, SUPPOSEDLY, trying to get her trailer done before me. Also her parents did EVERYTHING FOR HER. She doesn’t have to worry about the money because she has her parents to fall back on. Unfortunately i’ve been stuck paying vet bills for an injury my horse sustained so my project is on hold. So she’s got her opening date set up. And according to one of my friends her espresso machine is broken, and the waters not working. Anyways, my whole theme was basing my coffee truck on horses. I wanted drinks that were themed on horse coats and breeds. And i see a post from her business account.. she’s doing the same thing i’m doing but with cats. It was such a kick in the gut seeing that as i was already mildly upset about the trailer. But now she’s just copying me in a diff font. So i message her “coats and breeds… sounds familiar” She then blows up on me again. She says shit like”Believe it or not, animal themed coffee trailers aren’t an original idea!” (which i get, but again she clearly copied me) “well it’s not my fault you couldn’t work on your camper”(as if her parents didn’t do every single thing for her) And “you’re just jealous” (i’m not, just hurt someone i saw as a friend did this to me)Not a single apology throughout this fiasco that was actually genuine. I wouldn’t even be terribly upset if she approached it the right way.. but she was very ignorant towards my feelings. Anyways. Me and Tam are not friends anymore and we don’t talk.. I’m worried i took it too far and want some outside opinions. ",2,1752609587.0,AITH,1,1.0,False

I use to make pretty nice cups on my roommate's varia VS3 but I don't live with him anymore.

Do I buy a new grinder? Or stay on this one and maybe change the burrs?

Offstage is where the real story takes shape.

In the van, at the merch table, over weak coffee and long drives, this is a band that earns every day. You can hear it in the way Jeff talks about Virginia like an old friend he never quite figured out but never gave up on either. And you feel it in the way they’ve stayed rooted in a set of values of community, intention, presence – even as they’ve scaled stages and sharpened their sound.

This isn’t just a band grinding it out. It’s a slow build. Less about momentum, more about staying power. What came through in conversation wasn’t tour stories or album promo, it was a conversation on how music becomes purpose when you keep showing up, day after day, with both hands on the wheel.

Beat her by a few minutes so got my drink and went to one of the two tables out the front of this place to wait for her. The table on the right was occupied by an older gentleman reading the paper so I took the other on the right. A few minutes later a man I'd place in his 70's (Old Man) comes up to the table, kinda looks at me, and then pulls out one of the three seats at my table. I look up politely and say: ""oh sorry, I have someone joining me."" He stares at me for a beat, so being the anxiousy person I am I say ""you're welcome to join us if you want.""

Old Man scoffs at me with a chuckle, makes eyes at the older gentleman sitting at the other table and says ""I'm amused that you think you're giving me permission to sit at this table. I always sit at this table.""

I respond ""oh so you have like a dibs on it?"" Old Man stares at me, then the other old man with the paper who I guess HE KNEW, goes ""you can sit here, I'm off anyway.""

Hey there! I’m an athletic 27-year-old from London with long black curly hair, seeking a Domme to build a dynamic with.

**About Me**

My hobbies include film, and I’m passionate about everything from classic and foreign films, to horror and schlocky B movies. I love music, and you can often find me at rock, metal, and hardcore shows around the city, as well as the odd jazz night too! I climb, hike and go to the gym fairly frequently, and I love it when my partner enjoys my body. I'll put a link to a picture of me (minus my face) here: [https://ibb.co/gZJzJv8L](https://ibb.co/gZJzJv8L)

**What I'm Looking For**

I’m looking for a woman between the ages of 21–31. I need a connection before starting a dynamic and I would love to talk about your interests and hobbies. I'm very politically engaged and consider myself rather left wing, so ideally I would like to find someone who shares a good amount of my world view.

**Now Onto The Fun Stuff**

If you think we’d make good play partners, FWB or romantic partners, feel free to pop me a message. I would love to build a 24/7 dynamic, but that’s not essential. Though I am a switch, I would love to deepen my submission and serve someone IRL who I can be proud to call my Domme.

My main kinks include service (including domestic service), worship, orgasm control, humiliation, and of course power exchange! I’m not a brat, and I love to obey and be of use to you; serving you and making your life better however I can. I’m not looking for a gentle or “soft” dynamic, and I prefer something closer to a traditional M/s style of play.

Hard limits: food play and sounding

Soft limit: pegging.

Not the kind that grabs at you immediately, but the kind that builds steady, loud, and unflinching. Just two guys onstage with a sound that hits like a full band.

Offstage is where the real story takes shape.

In the van, at the merch table, over weak coffee and long drives, this is a band that earns every day. You can hear it in the way Jeff talks about Virginia like an old friend he never quite figured out but never gave up on either. And you feel it in the way they’ve stayed rooted in a set of values of community, intention, presence – even as they’ve scaled stages and sharpened their sound.

This isn’t just a band grinding it out. It’s a slow build. Less about momentum, more about staying power. What came through in conversation wasn’t tour stories or album promo, it was a conversation on how music becomes purpose when you keep showing up, day after day, with both hands on the wheel.

Yes, I’m married.  
No, it’s not a real marriage anymore.  
No love, no laughter, just a lot of quiet standoffs and emotional exhaustion. If you’ve ever looked at someone and thought, *“How did we end up here?”*, then you probably understand exactly what I mean.

I’m 47, living in Florida, originally from the Western part of the USA, and I’m ready to connect with someone who feels the same kind of ache—someone who knows what it’s like to stay too long, give too much, and finally decide that life’s too short to keep doing that. I’m not trying to wreck lives or leap into anything fast. I just want something honest and real—for both of us.

# A little about me:

* Proud Floridian who loves being outside—**kayaking, swimming, bike ride, or just sweating through a hoodie in January**
* **Animal lover + vegetarian** (your dog will like me, guaranteed)
* **Sober 7 years** and plan to keep it that way—so I’d prefer someone who doesn’t drink, or at least understands that lifestyle
* **420-friendly**, but not a deal breaker
* I don’t have kids and don’t come with chaos
* I have a **stable job**, my own goals, and dreams (like maybe starting my own business someday)
* Not religious, but not a nihilist either—somewhere in the middle, just trying to be decent
* Big into **sports** (live or on TV), especially when it comes with yelling at bad refs from my couch
* Music: **80s/90s all day**, a mixture of rap, metal, and pop....I like music with a good grove.
* And yes—**huge fan of The Simpsons (golden years only, come on now)** and **King of the Hill**. If you laugh at dry humor and don’t mind sarcasm with heart, we’ll probably get along.

# What I’m hoping for:

Someone 35–50 who’s also in a tough relationship or coming out of one. Someone with a kind soul, a sharp sense of humor, and a need for connection that goes deeper than “wyd.” You don’t have to be in Florida, but if you are, awesome—maybe we grab a coffee or walk a trail one day and just... talk like human beings.

Let’s start with conversation. Penpals, voice chats, swap Spotify links, make each other laugh again. Whatever this becomes, I just want it to be *real*.

Thanks for reading. If you’ve been waiting for a sign to reach out to someone who gets it—this might be it.

Beep.

Lucas and I have been together for five years. And honestly? It’s been nothing but arguments since day one. We really messed up when we decided to have a baby in the middle of such a rocky relationship.

I’m an artist—I do neon signs and mural painting, mostly freelance. I usually set my own schedule, which has been a blessing and a curse. For the past year, Lucas has been unemployed. He said he got fired but never told me why.

Our daughter, Naya, just turned one last month, and Lucas has been in a dark, distant mood ever since. I tried to chalk it up to stress or maybe guilt—maybe he hated that he couldn’t afford a gift, or maybe seeing her grow reminded him how fast life was moving. I don’t know. What I do know is that I’ve been the one carrying the weight—emotionally and financially.

Now it’s been a full week since he disappeared. No messages. No calls. No word. I told myself maybe he was at his mom’s, too embarrassed to come home. But she doesn’t answer her phone either. Hell, that woman never hears it ringing.

I couldn’t take the anxiety anymore. I grabbed Naya, packed her diaper bag, and loaded her into the car. As I cranked the engine, my phone lit up—Lucas’s mom finally called me back.

“I haven’t seen him in a few days,” she said casually, as if this was normal.

My stomach dropped. I didn’t know what to do next, so I drove to the coffee shop on Main to get myself a latte and Naya a vanilla bean frappuccino. Maybe some caffeine would help me think.

As I stepped out of the car, a woman approached me.

“Hey, I know this is random, but can you buy me a coffee? My card is locked and I’ve had the shittiest day. I just really need some espresso in my system.”

She looked like she’d been through hell, and I wasn’t in the mood to be cruel.

“Sure,” I said. I placed the order, and when the barista handed me the drinks, I walked back over to her.

“Here you go. I’m happy to help.”

She took the cup gratefully, and I couldn’t help but ask, “Rough day?”

“Yeah,” she sighed. “My boyfriend’s been playing shitty games with me lately, so I had to lock my accounts and figure things out.”

“Damn. Sounds like we’re in the same boat,” I replied. “Mine just ghosted me a week ago. No call. Nothing.”

She winced. “That sucks. I’m Julie, by the way. Maybe we can catch up later?”

“Nice to meet you, Julie. I don’t usually give my number out, but I can add you on Snap.”

She smiled and typed her username into my phone. We said our goodbyes and I returned to the car with Naya.

Something still didn’t feel right. I remembered Lucas’s old coworker, Josh, and thought, hell, why not? Maybe he’s heard from him.

Ring… ring…

“Hello?”

“Hey, Josh, this is Carolyn—Lucas’s girlfriend. I was wondering… when was the last time you saw him?”

“Oh hey, Carolyn! Nah, we haven’t seen Lucas since he took vacation last week.”

“Vacation? Lucas doesn’t work there anymore. He got fired a year ago.”

Josh chuckled. “Uh… what made you think that? Lucas is one of our best guys. He’s still working—he’s just on paid leave right now. Probably off fishing or something.”

I stared into the distance. “He hasn’t had money in over a year. I’ve been paying his car insurance, gas, groceries—everything. He said he lost his job and couldn’t find another.”

“Look, I don’t know what’s going on between you two, but that man definitely works with us. Just… don’t tell him I said anything.”

“Sure. Thanks, Josh.”

I hung up the phone and sat in silence, trying to process everything. If he’s been working this whole time, why lie? Why take money from me—money I needed to raise our child—when he had his own?

When I got home, I took Naya inside. I debated calling the police. What if Josh did something to him? What if this had to do with why Lucas said he was fired?

My phone buzzed—a Snap from Julie.

“Men really aren’t shit.”

Then another.

“I’m starting to feel bad because I think something bad happened to my boyfriend.”

“Actually, I hope something bad happens to mine. LOOK AT THIS.”

She sent a screen recording of a wedding video. I clicked on it—and nearly dropped my phone.

There, in a beautiful ceremony with white orchids and a golden arch, stood Lucas—dressed in a tux, exchanging vows with a woman I didn’t recognize.

My throat closed up. I rewound the video. It was him. Smiling. Kissing her. Looking happy.

I texted Julie immediately.

“HOW the fuck do you have a video of LUCAS getting MARRIED?! Who the hell is that woman?!”

She replied, confused.

“Carolyn, that’s not Lucas. That’s Brian—MY boyfriend. We've been dating for a month. I just found this video on my friend’s story.”

“Julie. That is NOT a Brian. That’s LUCAS. I’ve been with him for FIVE YEARS. We have a DAUGHTER.”

“No way…”

I told her to meet me at the coffee shop. We needed answers.

Ten minutes later, we were face to face.

“See?” she said, holding up her phone. “That’s Brian. He stole from me. Now he’s getting married.”

“Julie… that’s Lucas. Your ‘Brian’ is my Lucas. And yeah, he’s the father of my child.”

“What the actual fuck is going on?”

“He’s living a double life. Maybe a triple one. Who even is this man?”

We decided to track the video’s location. In the background, I spotted something familiar.

“Wait—look there. That mural on the wall. I painted that for Pride Month. I know where that is.”

“Let’s go. The video was posted less than an hour ago. Maybe we can still catch them.”

We took a bus an hour out, hoping we’d get back before our cars were towed.

The area looked festive, colorful. A man nearby told us it was a beautiful LGBTQ+ wedding. “A trans woman and her partner. The whole community’s celebrating.”

Julie and I exchanged glances. Things just got more complicated.

When we arrived at the afterparty, the moment we spotted Lucas, his face turned ghost white.

He froze.

Julie and I stared at him, standing with his new bride, laughing—until he saw us.

And in that silence, without a word, Julie stepped forward, grabbed my face, and kissed me—hard and slow.

The crowd erupted in cheers, probably thinking it was part of the celebration.

Lucas stood stunned, as we pulled away and raised a glass someone handed us.

“To the liar who tried to live three lives,” someone yelled.

Julie smirked.

“Cheers to that.”",1,1752609005.0,ShareMySkills,0,1.0,False

Struggling to secure funding to fuel your business dreams? You're not alone! Many small business owners mistakenly believe that government grants are only for nonprofits or giant corporations. The truth is, there are tons of grant opportunities designed specifically to help small businesses like yours thrive. The trick is knowing where to look and how to apply. This article will uncover five hidden government grants that could be the financial boost you need to take your business to the next level. Let's dive in!

**The Challenge:** Navigating the grant landscape can feel like wandering through a maze. Many small business owners simply don't have the time or resources to sift through countless websites and application forms. This often leads them to miss out on valuable funding opportunities that could make a real difference in their bottom line. Competition is fierce, and understanding the nuances of each grant is crucial for a successful application.

**Unlocking Funding: Your Guide to Hidden Grants**

Okay, let’s get down to brass tacks. Here are five grants you might be overlooking, plus how to increase your chances of landing them:

*   **State Trade Expansion Program (STEP):** Thinking of expanding your business internationally? The STEP program provides financial assistance to small businesses looking to export their goods or services. It’s administered by individual states, so the amount and specific requirements vary.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Check your state's economic development website for details on their STEP program. Prepare a comprehensive export plan that outlines your target markets and strategies. Highlight how the grant will help you create jobs and boost your state's economy.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Imagine you run a small online store selling handcrafted jewelry. The STEP grant could help you cover the costs of translating your website into Spanish, attending international trade shows, or creating culturally relevant marketing materials.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't wait until the last minute to apply! The application process can be lengthy, and funding is often limited. Thoroughly research your target markets and demonstrate a clear understanding of international business practices.

*   **Rural Business Development Grants:** Got a business in a rural area? The USDA offers several grant programs aimed at supporting economic development in rural communities. These grants can be used for a wide range of purposes, including business training, technical assistance, and infrastructure improvements.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Visit the USDA Rural Development website to explore available grant programs. Determine if your business is located in an eligible rural area. Develop a project that addresses a specific need in your community and demonstrates a clear economic impact.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Suppose you own a small farm-to-table restaurant in a rural town. You could use a Rural Business Development Grant to purchase new equipment, expand your dining area, or offer culinary training programs for local residents.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Grants targeting rural areas often have specific requirements regarding job creation and community benefit. Make sure your project aligns with these goals and demonstrates a strong commitment to the local community.

*   **Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs:** These programs are perfect for businesses engaged in cutting-edge research and development. They provide funding for projects with the potential for commercialization.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Explore the SBIR and STTR websites to identify funding opportunities aligned with your research area. Develop a strong proposal that clearly outlines your research objectives, methodology, and potential commercial applications. Partner with a research institution if applying for an STTR grant.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Let’s say you’re developing a new type of solar panel technology. The SBIR or STTR program could provide you with funding to conduct research, develop a prototype, and test your technology in real-world conditions.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** These grants are highly competitive and require a strong technical background. Assemble a team of experts and seek feedback on your proposal from experienced grant writers. Make sure your technology is truly innovative and has the potential to disrupt the market.

*   **Grants.gov Small Business Search:** This isn't a single grant, but a powerful search tool. Many smaller, specialized grants are listed on Grants.gov but get buried. Refine your search by industry, location, and keywords relevant to your business.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Visit Grants.gov and register for an account. Use advanced search filters to narrow down the list of potential grants. Pay attention to deadlines and eligibility requirements. Create a system for tracking grant opportunities and managing application deadlines.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Imagine you run a green cleaning service. You could use Grants.gov to search for grants related to environmental sustainability or green business practices.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't be afraid to get specific with your search terms. The more targeted your search, the more likely you are to find relevant grant opportunities. Keep your Grants.gov profile updated to receive notifications about new funding opportunities.

*   **Local Government Grants and Incentives:** Don't forget to check your local city and county government websites for grant and incentive programs specifically designed for small businesses in your area. These programs may offer funding for things like business startups, job creation, or community revitalization projects.

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Visit your city and county government websites and search for economic development or small business resources. Attend local business events and network with government officials to learn about available grant programs.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Say you want to open a coffee shop in a newly developed neighborhood. Your local government might offer grants or tax incentives to encourage businesses to set up shop in that area.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Local grants often have a strong focus on community impact. Make sure your business plan clearly outlines how you will contribute to the local economy and improve the quality of life for residents.

*   **SBA (Small Business Administration):** Provides a wealth of resources for small businesses, including information on grants, loans, and other funding opportunities. It’s a free and invaluable resource for entrepreneurs.
*   **Grants.gov:** The official website for U.S. federal government grants. It's free to use and allows you to search for grants by agency, category, or keyword. Register for email alerts!

No ticket on the windshield. Why would there be?  
  
7/5 the person whose car I borrowed got a 'Final Notice of Delinquent Parking' for $63 (if paid after 7/7). The original ticket was $25 and went up to $48 if not paid by 6/27 (8 days before the ""final notice"" arrived)

Spoke with PPA. Can't do anything because the issuing officer took a pic of the ticket on the windshield. Not their problem that I never received the ticket. Thanks, pay us. 

People can get screwed if someone (or the weather) removes a ticket from the vehicle after issuing. What's to stop the issuing officer from taking a pic of it on your car and then tossing it?

* Experts link daily consumption to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.

India’s beloved snacks—samosas and jalebis—are facing growing scrutiny as public health officials push for awareness around unhealthy[ food](https://worldmagzine.com/food/) choices.

Medical experts warn that daily consumption of these snacks can cause more harm than most realize. Samosas, typically fried in reused oil, are high in trans fats, which elevate bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, contributing to [heart disease](https://worldmagzine.com/health-and-medical/single-blood-test-could-predict-womens-heart-disease-risk-for-up-to-30-years-study-finds/).

# From Street Food to Health Risk: Why Samosas and Jalebis Are No Longer Just Tasty Treats

The Indian government’s new advisory is not a ban but a push for greater transparency in food awareness. These educational posters are being placed in cafeterias and public spaces to nudge citizens toward mindful eating. It reflects a shift in how food is viewed—not just as nourishment or [culture](https://worldmagzine.com/culture/), but as a factor in long-term health outcomes.

According to recent statistics from the Poshan Tracker, 6% of children under five enrolled in Anganwadi centres are already overweight or obese. This rise in childhood obesity has triggered concern within the Ministry of Women and Child Development, prompting urgency in health messaging around snack foods commonly available and consumed.

Nutritionally, 100 grams of jalebi can contain around 356 calories, while a same-sized samosa has roughly 362 calories. These are energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods offering little more than immediate gratification. Experts say it’s not the occasional indulgence that’s dangerous—it’s the regular, unconscious [consumption](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/elevated-blindness-risk-from-instant-coffee-new-findings/) that causes real damage over time.

Cultural traditions and health goals often collide, and in India, where food holds deep emotional value, the challenge is immense. Rather than vilify snacks, health advocates are calling for balance—educating people on portion control, cooking methods, and healthier substitutions that retain flavour without risking long-term health.

As India navigates its growing [health challenges](https://worldmagzine.com/education/boycott-ends-call-for-healthcare-reform-in-south-korea/), beloved snacks like jalebi and samosa serve as a reminder that tradition must evolve with awareness.

My standard go-to this time of year is just a regular black iced coffee and sometimes I'll throw in a couple sweeteners or almond milk myself but 50% of the time, depending on the coffee shop, they will give me cold brew.

To my understanding, they are different things ('iced coffee' being hot-brewed coffee that's cooled and served over ice versus 'cold brew' that is steeped for 12-24 hours) and I do prefer the taste of iced coffee but otherwise it wouldn't really matter to me — except for the fact that cold brew is almost always $1.50 - $2.00 more expensive than the standard 'drip coffee' on their menu (even if 'iced' is usually an option for +50 cents or so). 

Is it not necessarily a given that a place will offer iced coffee even if they have regular drip coffee on the menu? Or am I just being up-charged for cold brew quite often?...",0,1752608684.0,AskNYC,10,0.17,False

After being together for a while, we wanted to move into our own place together. Her mom told us that she would move into something smaller and more affordable. So, we found a place and we were able to move in very quickly. We were under the assumption that her mom was moving as well once the lease ended, so my partner would be able to focus only on our bills. However, she ended up renewing her lease and staying there. My partner was fine with it and felt like she would still be able to afford our bills and hers. However, now that we have been living in our place for a few months, she has been struggling to pay for both.

We split our bills and probably pay around $1000 each for all of our monthly expenses combined. She pays around that same amount for her mom's bills. This has made us struggle to afford everything over the last couple of months. My partner even had to just recently get a second job to be able to afford everything.

I've expressed how unhappy I am about the situation, as I feel that she should not be paying her bills when we are struggling too.

# Best Round Oriental Rug: 2025 Buying Guide

Round oriental rugs offer a unique blend of artistry, tradition, and functionality, bringing warmth and elegance to any space. Their distinctive shape makes them ideal for defining areas, softening angular rooms, and adding a focal point to your décor. Selecting the perfect round oriental rug requires careful consideration of factors like material, design, size, and construction quality, but the results can be transformative. This guide will navigate you through the key aspects of choosing the best round oriental rug in 2025, helping you make an informed decision that elevates your home's aesthetic.

## key Features Analysis

The ideal round oriental rug will possess several critical attributes to ensure both beauty and durability. these features will influence its longevity, appearance, and overall value.

**Material:** The material used in a round oriental rug considerably impacts its quality, feel, and maintenance.

Common materials include wool, silk, cotton, and synthetic fibers like nylon or polypropylene. Wool is prized for its durability, stain resistance, and soft texture. Silk rugs offer unparalleled luster and intricate detailing, but require more delicate care. Cotton rugs are more affordable and easier to clean, but less resistant to wear.Synthetic materials offer budget-amiable options with good stain resistance, but lack the luxurious feel of natural fibers.

**Knot Count:** Knot count, measured in knots per square inch (KPI), is a primary indicator of a rug's intricacy and craftsmanship.

A higher knot count generally reflects finer detailing and a more durable rug. While a higher knot count typically increases the rug's price, it signifies its investment quality and longevity. Aim for a knot count that balances detail and budget, depending on the intended use and room aesthetic. Rugs with a knot count exceeding 200 KPI are considered high-quality and are often investment pieces.

**Design and Pattern:** The design and pattern of a round oriental rug adds to its aesthetic appeal and can be tailored to fit different settings and preferences.

Customary oriental rug patterns often feature intricate floral motifs, geometric designs, and repeating borders. These patterns can be inspired by various cultures and regions, including Persian, Turkish, and Indian traditions. Modern interpretations often incorporate abstract designs, simplified motifs, or bold colour palettes. Consider your existing décor and personal style when choosing a design, ensuring it complements your room's overall aesthetic.

**Dye Quality:** The quality of the dyes used in the rug is crucial for its colorfastness and long-term appearance.

High-quality dyes, whether natural or synthetic, resist fading and bleeding, preserving the rug's vibrancy over time. Natural dyes, derived from plants and minerals, offer rich, subtle colors but may require more maintenance. Synthetic dyes provide consistent color and are typically more resistant to fading. Ensure that the rug utilizes colorfast dyes certified for their durability and resistance to environmental factors.**Construction Type:** The construction method, such as hand-knotted, hand-tufted, or machine-made, significantly impacts the rug's quality and value.

hand-knotted rugs are the moast labor-intensive and valuable, as each knot is tied individually. Hand-tufted rugs are made with a tufting gun, which inserts yarn into a backing material, and are generally less expensive than hand-knotted rugs. machine-made rugs are produced by automated looms, offering affordable options but lacking the character and durability of handmade rugs.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality round oriental rug provides numerous practical and aesthetic benefits, enriching the ambiance and functionality of your living space.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A round oriental rug can dramatically enhance the aesthetic appeal of any room, adding a touch of elegance, warmth, and cultural richness.

Its unique shape creates a focal point, softening harsh lines and balancing the room's overall design. The intricate patterns and rich colors found in oriental rugs can complement or contrast with existing décor, creating a visually stimulating and harmonious environment. By choosing a rug with complementary colors, you can enhance the look of the room significantly more than with a square or rectangle rug.

**Improved Acoustics:** round oriental rugs offer enhanced sound absorption, improving room acoustics by reducing echoing and dampening noise.

The dense fibers and construction absorb sound waves, creating a quieter and more cozy environment. This is particularly beneficial in hardwood-floored rooms or open-concept living spaces where sound tends to reverberate more. By creating a dampened echoing, the room feels warmer and less cavernous.

**area Definition:** Round oriental rugs can effectively define spaces within larger rooms and open floor plans, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.

Placing a round rug beneath a dining table creates a designated dining area, while positioning it in a living room beneath a coffee table establishes a clear seating area.This segmentation helps to visually organize the space, making it feel more cohesive and inviting. Unlike their rectangular counterparts, round rugs soften rooms with many corners, making them ideal for many open concepts.

## FAQs Section

Common consumer questions regarding round oriental rugs often revolve around their versatility, care, and suitability for different spaces.

**Are round oriental rugs suitable for bedrooms?**
Yes, round oriental rugs work exceptionally well in bedrooms. They can soften the angular nature of bedroom furniture and create a cozy, inviting atmosphere. A round rug placed partially under the bed can provide a soft surface to step onto in the morning, adding warmth and comfort to the room.

**How should I properly care for a round oriental rug?**
Proper care involves regular vacuuming without a beater bar to prevent fiber damage. Gentle spot cleaning with a mild detergent for spills and stains is essential. Professional cleaning by a rug specialist is recommended every one to three years to maintain its beauty and longevity. Rotate the rug periodically to ensure even wear and prevent fading from sunlight.

**What size round rug is ideal for my dining room?**
The ideal size depends on the dimensions of your dining table. The rug should extend at least 24 to 36 inches beyond the edge of the table to accommodate chairs when they are pulled out. Ensure that all chair legs remain on the rug even when seated. Measuring both the table and the surrounding area helps determine the appropriate rug diameter.

I exhibited at Books in Bloom, a conference put on by Chicago North Romance Writers. I'm considering making a little bonus vlog about this conference for Patreon, but I haven't done so yet.

Anyway, things about this festival that went well:

* It was the right size for its audience. It was held at one of the hotels near O'Hare Airport, and it utilized 3 rooms that could be made into 1 or 2 rooms depending on which walls you closed or opened. It didn't pretend to be bigger than it was, so it didn't have tons of empty space.
* The prices were reasonable. I paid $100 for the conference, which included having a table to exhibit and sell books, PLUS ...
* ALL THE FOOD WAS INCLUDED! It was a 2-day conference, and we had a dinner buffet Friday night, a breakfast buffet Saturday morning, and a lunch buffet Saturday afternoon. There was always PLENTY OF FOOD - salad, meats, vegetables, pasta, etc. A variety of options at every meal. And the food was tasty! Plus, there were desserts and snacks, and there was unlimited coffee and iced tea always available on the tables.
* All promises were kept! When I arrived, I got a swag bag including 2 ARCs from other authors. When I went to set up my table, it had a provided tablecloth, as promised. When I went to speak on the LGBTQ romance panel, all tables and chairs were set up well in advance. Basically, everything you should expect from a well-run conference!
* The schedule was clear, and nothing felt rushed. We had plenty of time to eat at each meal, and we had plenty of time to watch as many other authors' panels as we wanted to. Everything was in rooms right next door to one another, so it was easy to get from place to place.

Basically, I had a wonderful time, and I'm so glad to be able to shout out an event that did everything right!",14,1752608183.0,savywritesbooks,2,1.0,False

1m0reaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantImprovement/comments/1m0reaf/permits_for_commercial_projects/,Permits for Commercial Projects,"# Understanding the Permitting Process for Small Commercial Projects

For many small business owners and developers, the permitting process can feel like a maze — especially when tackling a commercial build-out for spaces under 25,000 square feet. Whether you’re opening a coffee shop, medical clinic, or boutique retail store, understanding the permitting process early can save you time, money, and stress.

Here’s a breakdown of the key steps, requirements, and common pitfalls involved in getting your small commercial project permitted.

# 🗂️ What Is a Permit and Why Do You Need One?

A **building permit** is a legal authorization issued by your local city or county government that allows you to construct, alter, or renovate a building. It ensures your project complies with **zoning laws, building codes, ADA requirements, life safety standards**, and other local ordinances.

**Without the proper permits**, you risk:

* Project delays
* Fines or stop-work orders
* Difficulty obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy (CO)
* Insurance complications
* Possible legal liabilities

# 🏗️ Common Types of Permits Needed

1. **Building Permit** Required for most structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work.
2. **Zoning or Land Use Review** Ensures your intended use (e.g., restaurant, fitness center, daycare) complies with the site’s zoning designation.
3. **Health Department Approval** Needed for food and beverage, medical, beauty, or wellness spaces.
4. **Fire Marshal Review** Confirms compliance with fire suppression systems, egress routes, and occupancy loads.
5. **Signage Permit** Separate permit for exterior signage or window decals.

# 🧠 Tips to Stay Ahead

* **Start early.** Permitting can take longer than the construction itself.
* **Hire professionals who know your jurisdiction.** Local experience matters.
* **Don’t skip the pre-application phase.** It can uncover major red flags.
* **Ask about expedited options.** Some cities offer fast-track reviews for a fee.
* **Keep your contractor looped in.** They often help with inspections and compliance.

# 🚧 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

* Signing a lease **before** confirming your use is allowed by zoning
* Assuming your landlord will handle permits
* Using **residential designers** for commercial work
* Not budgeting for **permit fees** or code upgrades
* Overlooking the timeline for inspections and rework

Small commercial spaces may seem simple compared to ground-up developments, but they’re still governed by the same building and safety regulations. Knowing the process — and planning for it — can mean the difference between a smooth grand opening and a series of costly setbacks.

Posts in this thread were really helpful to me as I was preparing for surgery so I thought that I'd also contribute! I just wanted to give some bullet points of my experience thus far with as much detail as I can. I was really anxious going in so hopefully this is helpful for people who like to know as much as possible (though of course, every doctor/hospital/surgery/body is going to be a bit different)

**""Day"" 0 (Before surgery prep)**

* I was sooooo anxious leading up to the procedure. I had absolutely zero hesitation about the decision to get it done, but i've never been ""under"" before so I was scared just of the unknown.
* A few days before the surgery date, I threw a ""No Baby Shower"" and had friends over for brunch. It was so helpful to talk about it with my loved ones, celebrate body autonomy, and re-establish plans for getting help during recovery
* Over a month prior I had made a google doc with a list of what to expect, what to buy, and things that I would need to call 911 about if they happen during recovery. I also included a little calendar with ""morning"", ""afternoon"", and ""evening"" slots for the first four days and shared it with my boyfriend and other friends so that they could sign up to come over to my house and take care of me/the cats. In no time, all the slots were filled. I'm so grateful.
* The day before surgery- I did a deep clean of the house, did laundry, took an ""everything shower"", and set up little ""stations"" around my house (might be important to note that my house is 2-stories & as my bedroom and bathroom are upstairs, I didn't anticipate going downstairs very much if at all the first couple of days):
   * In my bedroom:
      * I cleared the usual stuff off my nightstand and prepped it with ibuprofen, acetaminophen, gas-X, urinary pain relief pills, throat lozenges, and a medication tracking sheet & pen
      * I moved a comfy chair from another room right next to my bed so that friends could sit with me when I wanted company
      * I moved a stool from another room right next to my bed for my water bottle and for food
      * I laid out pads, baby wipes, comfy underwear, and nightgowns/house dresses at accessible places so I wouldn't have to bend over
   * In the kitchen:
      * I wrote out a paper with info on where certain meals are in the fridge/freezer and what supplements I might want to take.
      * I laid out snack bars, throat coat and ginger lemon tea, and Miralax on the counter so it would be easy for friends to find
   * In the laundry room
      * I wrote out information about my two cats for my friends to be able to take care of them. One cat (my roommate's, who was gone the first three days) is afraid of everything and the other (mine) is either a chaos demon or a snuggle bug who makes biscuits on my belly, so the cats are banned from my bedroom and I needed help taking care of them while my roommate was gone.
   * In the bathroom
      * I just made sure I had fragrance-free soap easily accessible in the shower
* I got a call at some point in the early evening that my surgery was to take place at 6am the next day. This actually ended up being a relief because that meant my boyfriend could be there with me the whole time, instead of dropping me off to get picked up by a friend.
* Futsing around the house, deep breathes, calling my mom, taking a nice long bath, and watching Avatar the last Airbender helped with the anxiety

**Day 1 (surgery day)**

* My boyfriend and I got there at 5:45am. I was in my cozy pajamas and had brought a sweatshirt even though it was boiling hot because so many posts said it was freezing in the hospital (they were right)
* Shortly after checking in, they called me back and I was so relieved to learn that my boyfriend could come with me. A nice nurse introduced herself and gave me a hospital gown, grippy socks, and a hair net thing to change into.
* I had to take all my jewelry out- I didn't come with my necklace or any rings, but I didn't expect to have to take out my nose ring or my earrings. I was nervous about the earrings because the piercings were still healing even though it had been a few months, but they were easy to put back in after. For the life of me I couldn't get my nose ring out (I never had! It was a hoop and I didn't know how it worked) but one of the doctors could do it with her small hands and she was really nice and funny about it.
* I met so many people as I just sat up in this bed and waited for surgery time. Both doctors that would be operating came in to say hi and talk for a little, someone came to put my IV in (I HATED that part, it was in my hand and that really freaked me out- but I just squeezed my bf's hand and looked at him and it was fine once it was in), someone came and put a band around my arm and checked my blood pressure, someone came and stuck a bunch of monitoring stuff on my chest and belly, the anesthesiologist came to introduce himself, etc. Everyone was super nice, but it was a little bit overwhelming! They all asked for my name, date of birth, and what procedure I was getting done. This was for about an hour.
* I was feeling better once the IV was in, comforted by the fact that for the freakiest part of this whole thing, I would be knocked out, but I was still anxious. I even asked ""what if I wake up in the middle of surgery"" and my bf was just like ""that is not going to happen."". He knew when to make gross jokes to be silly and calm me down and when to be firm and reassuring.
* Eventually, it was time to be rolled in to the operating room! My bf walked with me until we had to go opposite directions. He grabbed my hand and kissed it and the lady wheeling me in rubbed my head and said ""I like him!"" it was cute.
* The operating room was freaky! It was cold and everyone had masks (obviously) and the table was just right there, cold and metal like the movies. I got scooted onto it and I was shivering. They have me lots of warm blankets and someone put a gas mask on me and then.... I woke up somewhere else! It was truly like time travel.
* I was suuuuuuper groggy and out of it when I woke up- so the next bit is hazy. Nurses eventually stood me up to put that hospital underwear on me, then they walked me to another room and said ""We'll take you to the recovery room where your husband is"" and I said ""I don't have one of those"" (lol)
* They gave me a ginger ale and saltine crackers and asked about my pain level. At first I said 2 or 3, but then I said ""actually it's creeping up there"" and said 5 or 6 and they gave me an oxycodone tablet. My bf was able to pick up my prescription at the in-hospital pharmacy while I was in surgery.
* I feel like I just sat for a bit and talked to my bf, I felt reallllyyy out of it but I remember I really wanted to make sure he had texted my mom.
* A nurse came in and went through a file with all of the recovery/discharge information. I wasn't really able to hang on to much but I was relieved that my bf was listening and that all the info was in writing in the file that they were sending me home with.
* They said I had to pee before I was discharged, so eventually I was ready to and I had to carry the little IV bag with me which gave me a little bit of the heebie jeebies.
* My bf went to pull the car around to the front and a nurse wheeled me out in a wheel chair
* The ride home was a breeze.
* As far as pain for the day, I just really felt like I had to fart- you know that really bad gas pain? That's what it felt like
* I got comfy in my bed and my bf stayed with me until he had to go to work (bartender) and then my friends came over. I stayed in bed most of the day except to go to the bathroom. My belly and shoulder hurt like hell (with that gassy pain) and my throat hurt from the tube.
* I kept track of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and sucked on the throat lozenges and took gas-x. The urinary pain pills weren't needed.
* Overall I felt fine! The pain felt totally manageable and feeling that fine on day 1 felt really hopeful.

**Day 2 (these will get shorter now)**

* I mastered the ""pregnancy roll"" that my friend with kids taught me. Using any core muscles hurts pretty bad, so rolling first onto my side, then pushing up with my arms to get up worked wonders.
* On this day, my gas pain was still the main symptom and I was really bloated
* I didn't feel super immobilized, so I tried to do random laps from my roommate's room to my room to get some movement in
* My incisions (mainly my belly button) started bruising, which I didn't expect for some reason.
* I pooped after taking some miralax, so that was very exciting
* I developed (and still have) a little cough from how sore my throat is, and the coughing really hurts. It feels like it's tugging on my belly button- idk know else to describe it.
* Pain levels were totally manageable though. I used Ibuprofen and aceteminophen during the day and took an oxy to sleep, which worked out really well

**Day 3**

* I took a shower! It was easy, I just did it nice and slow and didn't make the water too hot. It felt so good to get the goop off of me from all the vairous things that had been stuck to me. Of course, I didn't scrub the incisions, just let soapy water run off of them. And patted those dry
* Pain levels are pretty much the same as yesterday, but on this day is when I started bleeding more from my vagina. The previous two days it had been spotting. This day I noticed more blood, but not near what they said would be concerning.
* I was really getting stir-crazy, so my bf and I planned to try taking a walk around the next day.

**Day 4**

* Bf and I took a walk to our friend's house. It was difficult but we took it nice and slow. I should add that this whole time I have not been able to really stand up straight and I'm still doing the ""pregnancy roll"" to get up and down to avoid using my core. So, walking around I'm sure I looked like a little old lady, especially with my house dress but i'm ok with that. Seeing our friend was nice and it felt so good to be in the sun, but I got drained really quickly and needed to lay down and watch TV when we got home.
* Took a shower again
* I kept bleeding more than I expected to, and I got a little freaked out. I messaged my doctor through the portal and they said it was fine with the amount that I was bleeding and that my activity is probably what's causing it- moving around causes the blood to flow and for the first two days I was laying down most of the time.
* The gas pain went away and I felt less bloated
* Still on a rotation of the two over the counter drugs, and the pain is totally manageable. When i'm still, i'm practically pain-free. If I cough or move in a way that uses my core or stand up too straight, it hurts but not horribly.
* Heating pads, ice packs, and yummy comforting food help

**Day 5**

* Decided to try to take it more easy today, I woke up in a little more pain and with more bleeding. Just because I feel a little antsy or bored doesn't mean my body has caught up to my brain. I had body parts removed! I gotta slow down :)
* My friend came over to bring me coffee and take a walk around the block with me. He laughed at me hobbling down the stairs and not standing up straight. It hurt to laugh but was also so nice to laugh with my best friend. He said I looked like one of his Indian Aunties because of how I was dressed and the way I was carrying myself.
* I called the hospital to make a follow up appointment and to ask about the bleeding. They said it was ok and normal. I should be concerned if I go through a pad an hour and if I have large blood clots. I asked what they meant by large and she said GOLF BALL SIZE so i was like ""oh, okay, i'm fine"".
* I'm feeling much better today- pain is totally dull and manageable. My main thing is that same sensation of something tugging on my belly button. My incisions are itchy but I heard that means they're healing?

I must admit I don't have previous experience with cursor or any other ide-integrated solution. I got helped by AI, using deepseek's huge conversation window, to share with it single problems, one at a time. 

I was amazed by what Kiro managed to do! In one day: things I planned to do the next month are all almost done! And it's free until they release the production version. 

I simply downloaded their ide, opened my project, asked it to read all my .MD files, once I verified it understood the overall architecture, I asked it to take a look at my mongoose model, then to my parent service class, it automatically navigated by curiosity to the individual implementation classes. 

Then I asked it to fix a bug I was always delaying because the simple idea of solving it was making me tired: I have 500+ unit tests, and a few of them were connecting to the production database and deleting my users :-o, I couldn't go to production with that.

It found the tests causing that, did that with techniques I didn't know about, a complete three layer fixing. Then I told it, that to be really sure, I wanted to add a line in my host file to intercept connections to the production database and make them fail. To my surprise, it write a bag script that changes my host file, runs the tests, then puts my host file back to it's original state. 

Then I have it a screen where a user can view data but cannot edit it, and told it: ""I want you to use the same logic as I have in /profile/+page. svelte where the user has a draft of his modifications to his profile, and changes are auto saved, but as long as he didn't publish, the official profile page doesn't change.

He created a server layout file, a layout file, a +page.server.ts file, a page and a component, it almost all worked at first try. 

One drawback is that it is a bit slow to process, so I found my self waiting for it to execute the tasks, and there I thought I could launch two or three ides on different machines to be able to do stuff while it is thinking. 

One hack I advice you to do, because conversations end up consuming all available tokens, and he then forgets it all. I explained it the project architecture, then asked it to write an AI-readme.md file where it documents all relevant information, it's links to. MD files or to source files, and when starting a new discussion, all it to read that file that he write himself. When you think he learned something new, ask it to update that file. 

That's all that comes to my mind, but I can tell you, I never thought it would be so advanced. Of I forgot to mention something, tell me in the comments.

I woke up feeling slightly dizzy (without vertigo) and thought I was coming down with a cold. As the day progressed, I noticed a strange whirring and ringing, along with a sudden decline in hearing in my left ear—likely due to a virus. I routinely have wax build-ups in my ears that block my hearing and cause ringing. Although this felt different, I was hopeful it was just another one of those [cases.As](http://cases.As) a professional musician who makes music for a living, I didn't hesitate to schedule a visit with an ENT the next morning.

At that appointment, I was diagnosed with SSHL. My loss was mild-to-moderate up to 6k and moderately severe from 6k–8k. I also had noticeable tinnitus and diplacusis (which is terrifying for a musician). I immediately began a two-week course of oral prednisone (60mg), with a taper starting around day 10. I didn't notice much change in the first few days, but my follow-up five days later showed small gains across the board. A subsequent follow-up at two weeks showed significant improvement, with deltas between 10–20 dB between my ears. One month later (six weeks after onset), audiometry showed total recovery up to 4 kHz, with small deltas remaining (4 kHz: 15 dB, 6 kHz: 5 dB, 8 kHz: 10 dB). I now believe these deltas to be even smaller.

My hearing now seems, for the most part, normal. Stereo listening sounds pretty balanced, and I only notice the asymmetry when isolating my ears. The diplacusis has mostly gone away; my left ear is a few cents flat in the lower frequencies, but I only notice it when isolating. My brain compensates for this when listening in stereo, making it a non-issue in practice.

I've been taking at-home tests using various apps and have noticed that healing is not linear from day to day—some days test higher than others—but I've observed an overall upward trend. In these tests, I focus less on dB values and more on the deltas between my ears. One thing I want to share is that mental health and relaxation have been critical to my healing. My worrying made both my hearing and tinnitus feel worse. It's essential to try to trust that your body will heal (I know this is easier said than done).

I'm still noticing improvements on my home tests and remain optimistic about a full recovery. The main thing I continue to struggle with is tinnitus in the 4–6 kHz range. I'm hopeful it will resolve, given how small the deltas are and that my hearing is now within a normal range across the board. I also ran home tests up to 18kHz and saw no significant deltas.

In addition to prednisone, I've been taking NAC, magnesium, ginkgo biloba, vitamin D, calcium, vitamin E, vitamin B, vitamin C, CoQ10, fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids, and a multivitamin. I've also been using Flonase and Afrin. Additionally, I've eliminated coffee, alcohol, refined sugars, and frozen foods, instead focusing on healthy, antioxidant-rich foods. I'm also doing acupuncture, which has been very helpful in managing anxiety.

Eight weeks ago, I thought my life was over. I was terrified I'd have to give up the profession I've trained for over 20 years. I had just won my dream job and moved to start in August. Every night, I would wonder if the whole experience was just some surreal nightmare. But through it all, I began to realize that no matter what, things would be okay.

I've met some truly incredible musicians with similar stories—some who maintain wonderful careers using technologies like Widex hearing aids, and others who don't need aids and have learned to adjust to their new normal. I've also come to see how important it is to slow down, give your body time to rest, and tend to what needs attention in both mind and body.

Please know you are not alone. No matter what, you *will* get through this and be okay.  
I write this still feeling afraid that I might have to live with this ringing in my ears for the rest of my life, but I truly believe these words.

I hope this story offers hope to anyone who is struggling.

UPDATE:  
I forgot to mention that I've been doing CIMT almost every day. I did this for 2-4 hours, starting around day 9, and then dropped down to an hour a day around week 4. ",3,1752607307.0,MonoHearing,3,1.0,False

The reason given was rule 4: the space was a womans space about women, for other women. The post was talking about male violence (but it also included male-on-male violence), and it was removed because it wasn't considered feminist enough
It was described as too “male-coded.” I was so confused.

Where are the spaces for ordinary women like myself? Working class women, working class feminists, who want to support women, and post for women but experience a life where, with the best will in the world, there is still  male violence? Where is our space to talk about what being a woman is really like? Because every day my life intersects with men. I exist in women's spaces, but I also intersect with mixed spaces and male spaces. I have friends, workmates, a partner, and children. Our lives intertwine, and the impact of male violence is everywhere.

I don't think people understand how male violence, including male-on-male violence, absolutely affects women, especially working-class women. Most of those men are in relationships with women. There’s always going to be a knock-on effect. If a man is violent, whether it’s in the home or not, it impacts on the woman in his life. Us. If your partner goes out with his friends one night and gets into an altercation  and gets stabbed, does it matter if only men were involved in the violent act? Because now your life instantly changes. We lose everything. Our finances are so precarious, and there are no safety nets for us. We can go from barely surviving to being homeless, single parent, public enemy number one, children at risk of foster care, mess in the blink of an eye.

If your son goes to school and there’s a shooting (another boy shoots him), does it matter that women aren't involved?  That violence will impact every woman,  the mothers, the grandmothers, the sisters.

How can male violence not affect women? You can’t separate violence from the relationships it touches. We aren't just women. We are wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters of men.

So why aren't we allowed to say that?

When I saw that post get taken down, in a group supposedly for women, about women, by women, I thought, how are we supposed to protect the people we love if we’re not allowed to talk about the very thing that affects us the most? What exactly are we supposed to talk about? Coffee mornings? Flower arranging?

Almost every aspect of our lives involves men. And male violence should be a top priority. School shootings, domestic violence, muggings, and street crime all of it can throw a woman’s life into complete disarray.

Feminism is literally about what it’s like to be a woman in a man’s world. So, how do you talk about feminism without talking about men and the impact they have on us? Talking that post down doesn’t feel like feminism. It feels like avoidance. It feels like a very specific type of feminism. One where we don't talk about the existence of men as though that will protect us. But why? Are we just supposed to stay blind to the things that can destroy our lives?

Honestly, I feel so invisible if talking about the things that hurts us the most is considered breaking the rules. How does that make sense?

Stop gatekeeping real women’s experiences! Stop deciding whether other women are allowed to hear about our lives. I don’t know what your lives are like, but when we lose a partner to violence, we lose everything. When a partner is incarcerated  for violence, we suffer. If we don't talk about it,  try to change it who will? This is not a just gendered issue. it's a feminist issue, and no one is talking about that.

“Emily…”

She kept her eyes fixed on the floor.

“... we need to talk about Jon.”

Silence.

Her hands were folded in her lap and her chin was tucked tightly against her chest.

“I need to know what happened. How he got…”

I paused, searching for the right words.

“... that way…”

Emily remained still and kept her head down. Nothing but silence followed my question.

It was late. Or, early, rather. My second cup of coffee sat steaming on the table between us. Maybe that room wasn’t the best choice; the carpet was musky, the paint on the walls was faded, several ceiling tiles were missing, and the fluorescent bulbs were well past due for replacement. 

It’s not like I had much choice in the matter. The church is where we found her, and there was no way I was walking her out of that building until the coroner left.  

“Look, I know you’ve been through a lot. Hell, more than any of us could have ever imagined experiencing.”

A tear fell from her cheek and onto the floor.

*‘At least she’s reacting*.’ I thought. 

“I’m not gonna tell you that I understand, because I don’t. If I did, we wouldn’t be here right now.”

I paused, hoping for some sort of response.

“That’s why I need you. I need your help to understand.” I said almost pleading.

I picked up my coffee and took a sip. 

“I… I can’t…”

Emily said as if she were holding back a cascade of tears. 

She spoke softly, but the fact that she had finally said something nearly made me fall out of my chair. 

“I need you to try.”

I said, placing my cup down and leaning closer. 

“I need to know what happened.”

She began to sob.

“Emily. I need to know how Jon… how his body…”

There was no easy way to say it. 15 years as a detective, and I have never seen such a gruesome scene. 

“Emily, who hurt Jon?”

She said something between her sobs, but I couldn’t quite hear what it was. 

“I’m sorry, I can’t hear what you’re saying…”

She said it quicker, but I was still unable to hear. Her breathing was rapid, and the tears began to drop from her cheeks.

“Emily, you’re going to have to look at me. I can’t hear what you're saying…” I said, growing concerned with how upset she was becoming. 

“I can’t…” She finally said.

“Why not?”

“I’m… I’m afraid it’ll do it to you too…” she sobbed.

I placed a hand on her shoulder.

“Emily, there’s nothing that can hurt us here. We’re safe. You’re safe.”

A man ought to own what he builds. That used to be common sense. You put in the work, you ought to have some say in how things are run. Nowadays, that idea will get you called a radical.

But the way some folks talk about freedom now, you’d think it just means waving a flag, paying taxes, and picking which millionaire to vote for every four years. Meanwhile, the same kind of people who used to send in thugs with rifles are still running the show—just wearing suits now, not uniforms.

Back in the day, when a man got fed up, he stood his ground. Look at Ludlow, Colorado. 1914. Coal miners went on strike for something as basic as not dying on the job. The company kicked them out of their homes, so they built a tent camp for their wives and kids. Winter came. Then the National Guard came—with machine guns. Shot up the camp and set it on fire. Women and children burned alive in holes they dug to hide from gunfire.

That wasn’t overseas. That was here.

You want to talk about the Second Amendment? Blair Mountain, 1921. Ten thousand miners, many of them war veterans, marched to free a county from a bought-and-paid-for sheriff working for the mine bosses. They wore red bandanas so they wouldn’t shoot their own. That’s where the word “redneck” came from—armed, working men standing up to power. So what did the government do? Sent in Army planes. Dropped bombs on American soil to protect a coal company.

You think the law was on their side?

Same thing up in Michigan. 1913. Miners on strike were having a Christmas party. Someone shouted “fire” when there wasn’t one, just to spark a stampede. Seventy-three dead, mostly children. Crushed to death in a stairwell. Most folks have never even heard of it. Wonder why that is.

They call this a free country. But what kind of freedom do you have if your boss can ruin your life with a five-minute meeting? What kind of freedom is it if you can’t afford to miss a week of work when your kid breaks their arm? If asking what your coworker makes is “grounds for termination”?

The people who built this country—farmers, miners, welders, loggers, mechanics—they didn’t just work hard. They bled for the idea that a man’s dignity isn’t measured by profit. They believed in family, in church, in community. They believed in pulling their own weight, and not taking orders from anyone who wouldn’t pick up a shovel to save their own life.

Now they’d be called dangerous. “Unprofessional.” “Anti-capitalist.” Maybe even “communist.” But they weren’t following some manifesto. They were following their gut. Their Bible. The knowledge that it ain’t right for one man to get rich off another man’s broken body.

And the folks in charge? They haven’t changed. The Pinkertons have been replaced by consultants. The bombs just got replaced by budget cuts. But they still use scabs. Still punish workers for organizing. Still run their businesses like kingdoms and treat the rest of us like subjects.

They’ve got us fighting each other over crumbs while they buy lakeside homes off the sweat of people they’ve never met. And the worst part? They’ve trained us to thank them for it. Taught us in school that unions are bad, that standing up for yourself is selfish, that poverty is a personal failure—not the result of a rigged game.

But deep down, most folks still know better. They know freedom doesn’t mean trusting politicians. It doesn’t mean licking the boot that kicks you, or keeping your mouth shut to “keep the peace.” Real freedom means being able to walk into your job with your head held high, knowing you can feed your family and look your boss in the eye like a man—not like a servant.

If there’s anything worth preserving in this country, it’s that. Not the flag. Not the anthem. But the simple idea that no one has the right to own another man’s time, his labor, or his soul.

You want to honor the old ways? Start there.

I work maintenance at a long-term care facility. The folks living here range from their 60s to their 90s. Some remember World War II. Some remember when Elvis was on the radio. They watch all kinds of news—Fox, CNN, local channels, old-school radio, the newspaper. Some are die-hard for Trump. Others wouldn’t vote for him if you paid ’em. But across the board—90 percent of them agree on one thing: money and profit have ruined this place.

We used to be state-run. Back then, we had our issues, sure—but folks got what they needed. Since they sold us off to a private, for-profit company, things have gone from bad to worse. Staffing’s short, food’s worse, supplies are spotty. If something breaks, good luck. We had an elevator go down and stay down for weeks—not because we couldn’t fix it, but because corporate wanted to wait on a cheaper estimate for a “maybe” solution. Never mind that half the residents rely on that elevator to get around safely.

Drinks like coffee, milk, and ice water are still served with meals—but soda? That got cut. Not because the residents don’t want it. Not for their health. It’s gone because corporate yanked it from the budget. Now if they want a soda for lunch, they’ve got to buy it from the vending machine or the gift shop. It ain’t about care. It’s about margins.

Maintenance used to have three people. Now it’s two. We’ve got spare PTAC units—the wall air conditioners for resident rooms—but they’re all busted in ways we’re not allowed to fix ourselves. So they just sit there, waiting on an outside contractor. Meanwhile, the units in use are freezing over and leaking water through the floors. That drips into the ceiling below, ruins tiles, rusts out old plumbing. And still we can’t do anything, because corporate’s dragging its feet like always.

Supplies? Half the time we can’t even get the stuff we need. Not because it’s unavailable—because the vendors don’t want to deal with us anymore. This company has such a bad reputation for paying late, if at all, that local businesses are refusing to sell to us.

And the real kicker? The call bell parts—the devices residents use to call for help when they fall, or can’t breathe, or need the nurse? We ran out. Waited months for replacements. Management didn’t care. Nurses raised the issue. We raised the issue. Residents raised the issue. Nothing happened—until the state inspector came by. Then suddenly, management was out on the floor, acting like they always work there, helping out like it was just another Tuesday.

It’s not just frustrating—it’s wrong. These are human beings. Many of them wore the uniform, raised families, worked their whole lives, paid their taxes. Now they’re treated like line items in a spreadsheet. And every single person working in this building knows it.

And here’s the part that cuts across all politics: everyone here sees it. The residents know it. The nurses know it. The cooks, the housekeepers, the CNAs, the maintenance crew—we all know things worked better when it was publicly run. Not perfect, but better. You could get things fixed. You could get what you needed. Now? You have to jump through hoops and pray the budget approves it before something else falls apart.

So the next time someone tells you private companies are more efficient than public ones, tell them to come walk these halls. Come sit with a resident sweating through July in a room with a busted AC unit and no replacement in sight. Come explain to a 92-year-old woman why she has to choose between a warm cup of coffee and a cold soda because “corporate” says it’s not in the budget. Come tell a nurse there’s no call bell working in a room where the resident just had a fall last week.

Okay, Reddit fam, I gotta share something I've been trying out lately. I'm usually not one for all that ""woo-woo"" stuff, but I've been feeling kinda…off lately. Like a magnet for minor annoyances and just generally blah vibes. Anyone else ever get that feeling? 🤷‍♀️

So, I started looking into stuff that might help, and somehow ended up down a rabbit hole about evil eye jewelry. I know, I know, it sounds kinda out there, but the idea of a little extra protection against negative energy was actually pretty appealing. Plus, some of the designs I saw were actually really cute! I wanted something that wasn't too flashy, but still stylish enough to wear every day. I was looking for an affordable evil eye bracelet for good luck.

After way too much online browsing (seriously, my algorithm is now 90% evil eye bracelets, lol), I finally found one that caught my eye. It was a delicate blue evil eye bracelet. Blue is my favorite color, and the charm was small and understated. I figured, what could it hurt?

The moment I put it on, I swear I felt a little different. Maybe it was just me wanting it to work, but I felt a little lighter, a little more…shielded. Like I had a tiny, stylish bodyguard warding off all the bad juju. It's been a few weeks now, and honestly, things have been noticeably smoother.

I know it sounds crazy, but the little annoyances have definitely decreased. That constant background worry I usually carry around has quieted down. And I've even had a few unexpected wins, like finding a parking spot right in front of my favorite coffee shop (a true miracle in this city!).

Part of the reason I love this protection bracelet so much is that it's so easy to wear. I'm not a huge jewelry person, but this one is comfortable and goes with everything. It's also a great conversation starter! I've had a few people ask me about it, and it's fun to share the story behind the evil eye symbol and what it means to me.

It's also given me a sense of control. I know it sounds silly, but in a world where so much feels uncertain, it's nice to have something that makes me feel a little more secure. Plus, it's way less time-consuming than trying to meditate every morning (which I always *mean* to do but never actually get around to).

I was looking for an adjustable evil eye bracelet, and this one really fit the bill. I even found a site called ursupermart.com that had a bunch of different styles.

Honestly, even if it's just a mental thing, the increased sense of security and well-being is worth it to me. I've been recommending it to all my friends who are feeling stressed or overwhelmed.

Alright Reddit, spill the tea – anyone else ever feel like they're just… attracting bad vibes? 😩 I'm usually a pretty chill person, but lately it felt like I was walking under a constant rain cloud of minor inconveniences. Keys always missing, coffee spilling, you name it. I'm not super superstitious, but I was desperate for a change.

That's when I stumbled down the rabbit hole of evil eye jewelry. I know, sounds a bit out there, but the idea of a little extra protection against negative energy was appealing. Plus, some of the designs I saw online were actually pretty cute. I spent way too long browsing (thanks, late-night scrolling!), trying to find the perfect piece. I wanted something subtle, not too flashy, but still stylish enough to wear every day.

Finally, I found it: a delicate blue evil eye bracelet. It just called to me. Blue is my favorite color, super calming, and the evil eye charm was small and understated. I figured, what could it hurt?

The moment I put it on, I swear I felt a shift. Maybe it was just the placebo effect, but I felt a little lighter, a little more… shielded. Like I had a tiny, stylish bodyguard warding off all the bad juju. It's been a couple of weeks now, and honestly, things have been noticeably smoother.

I know it sounds crazy, but the little annoyances have definitely decreased. That constant background worry I usually carry around has quieted down. And I've even had a few unexpected wins, like finally getting a good deal on that concert ticket I wanted.

Part of the reason I love this good luck charm bracelet so much is that it's so easy to wear. I'm not a huge jewelry person, but this one is comfortable and goes with everything. It's also a great conversation starter! I've had a few people ask me about it, and it's fun to share the story behind the evil eye symbol and what it means to me.

It's also given me a sense of control. I know it sounds silly, but in a world where so much feels uncertain, it's nice to have something that makes me feel a little more secure. Plus, it's way less time-consuming than trying to meditate every morning (which I always *mean* to do but never actually get around to).

I was looking for an affordable evil eye bracelet for good luck, and this one really caught my eye.

Maturity? Life experience? Dad jokes? No, I don't have daddy issues, but I am looking for a step-dad for my cat.

About me: 5'1 Asian female, with a soft spot for intense things. I'm into: tattoos & body mods, prog. metal (Soen, Leprous, Haken, etc), watching sports (ice hockey, rugby 15s, ice fights), and motorbikes. I taught myself to ride manual in Bangkok city centre streets, I'm pretty proud of that.

On the softer side, I like: my cat, coffees & café hopping, and reading (the genre spectrum goes from Purge by Sofi Oksanen to Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi)

About you, hopefully: you're older, experienced in life, but still know how to relax. You're not a heavy drinker or a party guy. You appreciate a good strong coffee, know how to hold (read: lead) a conversation, are opinionated and enjoy sharing your thoughts (I love watching someone's brain uncoil, it's very fascinating). You take the lead, but you're not shut off to other perspectives or opinions either. Also, you must like cats.

Bonus but not required: you ride, you’re good with your hands, and maybe you’ve got a dry sense of humor tucked somewhere under all that calm.

Connection: I'm looking for an intentional connection. Let's see how the connection flows, as long as it's mutual and meaningful. Dynamics-wise, I do prefer a structured dynamic where you lead and I follow, but only if/when it's built on trust, clarity, and mutual respect.

If it sounds appealing to you, please ping me with a message about how you would try to win over a cat so I know you've read up to this point :)

1m0qlk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m0qlk5/update_aitah_sister_is_mad_that_i_have_no/,UPDATE: AITAH sister is mad that I have no reaction to her talking to my ex-girlfriend,"I posted yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/NbCHH5R0eO) that for the past couple of months by sister has been talking and regularly meeting up for coffee with my ex-girlfriend. We broke up 20 years ago because she left me for another man and I am now 40, quite happily married and a dad and I had no reaction cos I literally don’t care about the past or what my sister does.

I realised I had never given my sister an exact answer just that I had no visible reaction just that I asked her what she wanted from me and she was frustrated over it.

I ended up calling her not that long ago and we talked about it. I asked why she felt so strongly about wanting to know my feelings about it and a lot of you suspected she wanted approval and you were right. I explained in my original post that my sister and ex were quite good friends and that the friendship ended cos I got cheated on and my sister also felt betrayed. The two hadn’t spoken in 20 years.

When my sister and my ex were friends they did a lot with me and together. They did a lot together and were almost like best friends snd my sister told me that of course she was pissed and felt betrayed about the cheating but also sad because she lost her only genuine friend at that time. I know she has really struggled to maintain good friendships so she said when she happened to bump into my ex by chance and that they picked up where they left from, she leapt at the chance to kickstart their friendship. She said it’s like a fog has been lifted from her and that she feels like she has her best friend back. She said she wanted to tell me but thought I’d be weird about it because at the time, I was so cut up about the breakup. She feels really guilty for being happy about rekindling a friendship with someone who caused me so much pain. 

After hearing all that I understand why she wants to maintain the friendship and why she didn’t want to tell me. I explicitly told her that I have no reaction to it because without sounding like a dick I really don’t care who she spends her time with. I told her I feel enough time has passed that I can accept my ex is in her life, especially since my sister told me she is still with the man she left me for and they are married and have a family so they are obviously serious. She also said her daughters (my nieces) are the same age as my ex’s kids and that it would be good for the kids to be friends too which I get as they don’t have many. I like I said have also moved on and have been married for 12 years and I have 3 kids. I basically told my sister if she is looking for my blessing, she has it but that I won’t be involved or really interested in the friendship cos it doesn’t mean anything to me anymore. I also told her she shouldn’t feel guilty as it’s happened, it’s done and I moved on and recovered from it. Like if I saw the ex I would be civil but I wouldn’t be weird or anything about it cos again, I don’t really care. Plus from the sounds of it the ex will really only be mingling with my sister, potentially my BIL and their kids so I may not see her at all.

She left the call feeling at least happier and I’m just glad she has a friend back I suppose. Not an exciting update or anything but I guess a good outcome. We were just mature and civilised.",124,1752606254.0,AITAH,18,0.98,False

Here’s what I’m thinking:
	•	Add a comfortable couch or some kind of lounge seating
	•	TV setup for casual watching or light gaming
	•	Coffee table or something similar for the middle of the room
	•	Bookshelves or display units for personal items (like watches, books, and a few collectibles)
	•	Possibly changing the current wood accent wall to a darker, modern wood paneling

I’m about to start my first job in Germany (tech-ish company). I’ve been picking the brains of some friends and acquaintances, but I’d love more “micro” insights from people who’ve actually made the jump.

What I’ve heard so far:
* Don’t expect a cheery “Hi!” back every time you say good morning: greetings are more reserved, especially before the first coffee hits.

* Hierarchy matters: It’s usually safer to float new ideas in 1-on-1s or in writing first; coming in hot during a meeting can feel like challenging the existing system.

* Process > improvisation: Even small deviations (“let’s try this real quick…”) can raise eyebrows unless you’ve aligned with the project owner.

Looking for more of these bite-size nuggets. Things like:
* How direct you can be with feedback up/down the chain
* Any non-obvious office customs (lunch rules, coffee machine dos/don’ts, birthday cakes, etc.)
* Subtle body-language cues that scream “rookie foreigner” if you miss them

Don't Panic - Here's What to Do!,"Track Your GLP-1 Journey With The [GLP-1 LOG IOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glp-1-log-injections-tracker/id6747810242?platform=iphone)


We've all been there, haven't we? You're cruising along, feeling great, managing your health journey, and then BAM! It hits you - ""Did I take my Semaglutide this week?"" Or maybe you're packing for a trip and realize you left your pen at home. It's a surprisingly common scenario, and trust me, you're not alone in feeling that little jolt of worry.

When you're on a medication that's doing so much good, missing a dose can feel like a huge setback. You might be wondering, ""What happens now? Will all my progress disappear? Should I just take it as soon as I remember?"" Good questions! The good news is, a missed Semaglutide dose isn't usually a crisis. In fact, knowing what to do - and what *not* to do - can save you a lot of stress. Let's dive into exactly what happens and how to handle it like a pro.

**First Things First: Don't Double Up!**

This is probably the **most important** piece of advice when you realize you've missed a dose. Your first instinct might be to just take it immediately, or even worse, take two doses to 'catch up.' Please, **don't do that!**

Semaglutide works by mimicking a natural hormone, GLP-1. Taking too much can significantly increase side effects, especially nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It's really not worth the discomfort, and it won't speed up your progress.

**When Did You Miss It? Timing is Key**

The action you take after missing a Semaglutide dose largely depends on *when* you remember. Because Semaglutide is a weekly injection (or daily for the oral form, but we're focusing on the weekly for this post), its effects last for quite a while in your system. This is actually pretty cool and gives you some wiggle room.

**If It's Within 5 Days (120 Hours) of Your Missed Dose**

Let's say your usual injection day is Sunday, and you suddenly remember on Wednesday morning that you forgot. You're still within that five-day window.

* **Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.** Just inject it as you normally would.
* **Adjust your next dose day.** If you usually inject on Sunday, but you took your missed dose on Wednesday, your *next* dose will now be the following Wednesday. This helps you get back on a consistent schedule.

**If It's More Than 5 Days (Over 120 Hours) Since Your Missed Dose**

What if your injection day was Sunday, and you don't remember until the following Friday? That's more than five days. In this scenario:

* **Skip the missed dose entirely.** Do not take it.
* **Take your next scheduled dose on your regular day.** So, if your usual day is Sunday, and you remembered on Friday (over 5 days late), just wait and take your next dose on the upcoming Sunday. You're essentially just resuming your normal schedule, albeit a week later than planned.

**Why Does Semaglutide Have This Flexibility?**

It all comes down to something called a **half-life**. This is a fancy term for how long it takes for half of the medication to be cleared from your body. Semaglutide has a remarkably long half-life - about a week!

* **Long-lasting effect:** This long half-life is why you only need to take it once a week. It slowly releases and works in your system for days.
* **Buffer for missed doses:** Because it hangs around for so long, missing a single dose doesn't immediately cause the medication to completely leave your system or stop working. There's still some residual effect.

This built-in 'buffer' is a real blessing. It means your progress won't instantly vanish, and you won't suddenly feel a huge rebound in appetite or other symptoms just from one missed dose.

**Potential Side Effects of Missing a Dose**

While a single missed dose isn't catastrophic, you might notice a few things. These aren't typically severe, but it's good to be aware.

* **Return of Appetite:** This is probably the most common effect. Semaglutide helps reduce appetite and cravings. If you miss a dose, you might find your hunger cues returning more strongly than usual. Don't be surprised if those cravings for snacks creep back in.
* **Slight Weight Fluctuation:** Due to the return of appetite, you might see a small uptick on the scale. Don't fret! This is likely temporary and will stabilize once you're back on your routine.
* **Less Fullness:** That feeling of early satiety - getting full quickly - might diminish. You might find yourself eating larger portions.
* **No Immediate Crash:** The good news is, you're unlikely to experience a sudden, dramatic ""crash"" or severe withdrawal symptoms from missing just one dose.

Remember, these are temporary effects. Consistency is key, and getting back on track is the most important thing.

**When to Reach Out to Your Doctor**

While most missed doses are manageable on your own, there are definitely times when it's smart to chat with your healthcare provider.

* **If you're unsure:** Always better safe than sorry! If you're confused about the timing, or if you've missed multiple doses, give their office a call.
* **Severe side effects:** If you tried to 'catch up' and are experiencing severe nausea, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms, seek medical advice immediately.
* **Extended break:** If you've missed several doses in a row (e.g., you've been off it for two or more weeks), your doctor might recommend restarting at a lower dose to allow your body to readjust and minimize side effects. This is particularly important if you're on a higher maintenance dose.
* **Any concerns:** If you just feel uneasy or have any questions about your specific situation, your doctor or pharmacist is always your best resource.

**Tips for Remembering Your Semaglutide Dose**

Life gets busy, and forgetting happens. But there are some easy ways to help yourself stay on track!

* **Set a weekly alarm:** Pick a specific day and time, and set a recurring alarm on your phone. Label it ""Semaglutide Time!""
* **Link it to a routine:** Associate your injection with something you do every week - like brushing your teeth before bed on a specific night, or after your Sunday morning coffee.
* **Use a medication tracker app:** There are lots of free apps designed to help you remember medications.
* **Keep it visible (but safe!):** If your medication doesn't require refrigeration, keep it somewhere you'll see it on your dose day, like on your nightstand (just make sure it's out of reach of kids or pets!).
* **Tell a family member:** Ask a trusted person to give you a gentle reminder on your dose day.

**You've Got This!**

Missing a dose of Semaglutide can feel like a big deal when you're focused on your health journey, but as you can see, it's usually easily managed. The key takeaways are: **don't double up**, understand the timing rules, and when in doubt, always **talk to your doctor**. Consistency is wonderful, but a little slip-up isn't going to derail all your hard work. Just get back on track, and keep moving forward.

Hi all, 

I’m looking for advice or insight into my sister’s behavior — our relationship has really declined, and I don’t understand why.

I’m in my early 30s, she’s 10 years older, married with a 14-year-old daughter (via IVF). We used to be close, but things changed — especially after I moved abroad in 2017 to be with my husband (who is actually her husband’s cousin).

Family background:

My dad’s been battling prostate and bone cancer since the early 2000s. He’s stable now but has lasting side effects and possibly early dementia. Due to his illness, my parents lost their home and went bankrupt. They offered my sister to move in with them if she helped with rent, but she refused — so they helped her find her own place before even securing ours

Years later my mom received a small inheritance and gave us both an equal amount. Since then, my sister constantly questions their spending. I don’t — I just want our parents to be okay. Ironically, she and her husband get financial help from his mother, including a mortgage down payment.

About me:

I’ve had a chronic pain condition since my teens. After years of hospital visits and surgeries, things improved around 2010. I met my husband online, and after a long-distance relationship, we married and I moved to North America (I was in living in Europe) life changed — I had more surgeries that reduced my pain, went to college, and started a remote business (my clients are in Europe).

Since then, my sister became distant. At first, we exchanged holiday calls. Now it’s just a text. She never asks how I’m doing, and though I’ve invited her to visit, she claims they can’t afford it — but they go on expensive trips like Disneyland.

I reguarly visit my parents (often flying in to help when needed). My sister never offers help, and even assumed I’d babysit her daughter — without asking. I’ve always stayed in touch with my niece, sending gifts and messages even if I just get a “thanks” back. But she is a Teenager. Lol

Current situation:

I’m currently pregnant — due in about a month. When I was 3 months along, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer (metastases in liver/lungs). I immediately flew home to help her and take care of my dad. The trip was meant to be about bonding before the baby, but I’m glad I was there for support.

My sister, who I supported during her whole pregnancy, just said “congratulations” and never asked anything about mine. She didn’t visit me or my mom — not even in the hospital. I asked her to go to chemo appointments with our mom, and she said yes — but canceled every time (too hot, dog needs her, etc.). She has been a stay at home mom for the past 14 years.

They even stopped their usual Sunday visits to our parents. Her excuse? She doesn’t want our mom to feel pressured to make coffee or cake. I think that’s just an excuse — she could easily bring those or visit without expecting anything.

They buy water, ice tea or Coke, for my parents every other week, but ask for triple the cost (and the one who brings the items is my brother in law). She only calls my mom when she needs something. She even told her it’s her own fault she has cancer for not getting a colonoscopy (when doctors believed her prior issues were stomach-related — she almost died two years ago during stomach surgery).

Now that my mom is applying for disability, my sister’s first question was, “Do you get money for that and will you give it to me?""

My mom is devastated and doesn’t understand why my sister won’t see her. My parents were always supportive — even during their toughest times. And I don’t get it either. Friends tell me she’s jealous, but of what?

I’ve never asked her for help. I take care of myself. I still make the effort to visit, call, support our mom, and keep in touch with her daughter.

I just don’t understand her. Is this jealousy? Entitlement? Resentment? Or something else entirely?

How do I deal with this — especially now with a baby coming and my mom in chemo?



Thank you if you read all this 💚

I live between München and Starnberg, and I’d love to meet someone nearby who’s also looking for something real. Life feels more meaningful when you can share it with someone special. And that’s exactly what I’m hoping to find. :)

I’m 187 cm tall with dark hair and blue eyes. I’ve got a muscular build with a bit of dad bod. I am also on the hairier side, just being upfront about it. I speak English, German, and Turkish.

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. Although nature helps me recharge, I’d say I’m introverted overall. I’m into anime and board games, so you could say I’m a bit of a nerd. :)

Hygiene is important to me. I lean toward minimalism and prefer a clean, tidy living space. I don’t smoke or drink, and while I’m not very religious, I do believe in kindness and keeping an open mind.

I’m looking for someone 30 or younger. What matters most is a strong connection; emotionally and physically. I tend to feel that spark more with women who are slim, fit, or have an average build. Just being honest about what I’m usually drawn to.

One thing that’s important to say early on: I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know it’s a big thing to mention, but it feels right to be open about what truly matters to me.

I’m not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I’d much rather meet in person, chat over coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe in real life.

There’s a photo on my profile if you'd like to put a face to these words. And if something here resonates with you, I’d genuinely love to hear from you. :)",1,1752605846.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

1m0qenv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m0qenv/fnhm_like_magic/,"[FN][HM] Like, Magic","“Why isn’t it working?” asked Benjamin Arboghast.

“I don’t know.” replied Margaret Finch. “We did the incantation, my latin was *flawless,”* She trailed off, “Wait. In here.” Maggy pointed into the old book she had brought over. She continued, “it says *untouched by other magic.”*

“So?” Ben asked.

“So? She died 3 days ago Ben. You’re telling me I was your first call?” Maggy was angry at the oversight. She was also angry that she wasn’t Ben’s first call when he decided to try resurrecting his beloved Dog, Daisy.

The dog’s body was sitting in front of them, on top of a messy pile of magic supplies, ancient books, and week-old fast food packaging. Under all of that somewhere, Maggy supposed, was Ben’s coffee table.

Ben hesitated. He looked nervous.

“Well there was this blood oath thing. But I doubt that was even-” Ben started.

“You took a blood oath? Where?” Maggy interrogated. She grabbed his hand and found a scar across his palm.

“Where did you bleed?” Maggy asked insistently.

“Right here! Over the phone. I don’t even know if you can call it a blood oath.” Ben said. Maggy looked at him with pity.

“Wait, was that real? I assumed it was a scam well because,” He gestured to the ripe, decaying carcass of his beloved pet, friend, companion, and confidant, Daisy.

“What was the number? What did they say?” Margaret inquired. She had softened her tone. This had been a difficult week for Ben.

Ben went over to the mess of paper and refuse that some may call a desk. He rummaged past herbs, scrolls, and vials with label’s like “might be pig’s blood” and “wrong snake venom, do not ingest” until he found a magazine, “Conjuror Quarterly”.

Maggy looked over as he flipped through. “Really? Conjuror Quarterly?” she asked, holding back a grin behind a judgmental expression.

Ben continued flipping, but looked up and across the room to her for a moment. “I like their articles, okay? And there are coupons for herbs in the back. Good discounts on wormwood and wolfsbane.”

Maggy took out her iPhone and began flipping through Witchr, the occult microblogging platform on which she was an influencer. She was waiting for verification so she could get a blue broomstick next to her profile picture. It was still pending.

“Found it!” Ben said. He brought the magazine over. It was opened to a full page ad for “Telewarlocks, LLC”

The headline was “Call us up for magic.”

There was an offensive graphic, a picture of very insensitive-looking old-timey stereotypes. One witch, one warlock. Below the image, it read “Our expert team of warlocks, mages, and conjurors is standing by to assist you.”

The page advertised resurrection as well as a whole slew of other services that, to Maggy’s knowledge, were impossible to perform over the phone. There were a few drops of blood on the bottom corner of the page, but they looked like they were part of the ad.

“Seems like a scam right? Oh how could I have been so stupid!” Ben exclaimed.

Maggy put her arm on Ben’s shoulder. “Hey. We’re gonna figure this out. What did they say on the call?”

“So I used the code from the ad.” Ben explained.

Maggy looked at the ad. The code was written at the bottom. It said “First time callers : Use code MAGIC47 for half off your first resurrection or transmutation spell.”

*Forty Seven. The Terminus Spell. It couldn’t have been a coincidence,* Maggy thought.

“Then what happened?” Maggy said, foreboding creeping into her voice. She looked at the page and grabbed Ben’s bandaged hand. “Please tell me this isn’t your blood. Please tell me it’s part of the ad.”

“Oh no that’s me.”

“Call them back. Call them back now.” Maggy ordered.

Ben got out his phone and called the number. He put the phone on speaker and set it on the coffee table, next to Daisy’s paw.

After two rings, a robotic voice spoke. “TeleWarlocks, LLC. This call will be recorded and monitored for quality assurance.”

The smooth jazz “on-hold” music came on for about 15 seconds before a cheerful voice answered.

“TeleWarlocks, LLC, how may I direct your call?” The voice asked.

“Yes I am calling regarding a resurrection order I placed earlier in the week.” Ben said.

“Is this Ben? For your dog Daisy? We haven’t received the vial of her fur yet in the mail” The voice responded, “Did you want me to call you when-”

Maggy tapped the mute button as the man on the line continued. “You mailed them her fur?”

“Is that bad?” Ben asked.

“Tell them to cancel it.” Maggy said, unmuting the phone.

“Hey there ! Maggy here, friend of the bereaved” She said to it.

“Yes? How can I help you ma’am?” The voice replied. “Did you also want to take part in our resurrection special? You won’t find prices like-”

“No I want to cancel the first resurrection. Full reversal. Blood oath removed, dog fur returned, the whole 9 yards.” Maggy said.

“I’m sorry ma’am unfortunately we cannot cancel the blood oath once the sacrament has been spilled on our enchanted scroll.” He said, in fluent customer service.

“Enchanted scroll?” she asked. “You mean your ad in Conjuror Quarterly?”

“Yes well, actually the ad itself has been enchanted with a very powerful spell. Mister uh, Arboghast’s blood actually bound him to TeleWarlocks, LLC legally. Nothing can be done until the fur-” He paused. “Oh that’s interesting.”

“What?” Ben said, now very worried.

“It does look like we just received the vial of Daisy’s fur. We will be able to perform the resurrection shortly.” the evil customer support representative said.

“Good news!” Ben exclaimed.

“Burn the ad. Burn it Ben!” Maggy commanded.

“What do you mean? They just said-” Ben was cut off by the voice on his phone.

“I assure you, now that we have the dog’s fur, burning our enchanted scroll will do nothing. TeleWarlocks LLC is proud to use the asynchronous conjuration platform. Your dog is coming back, and she’s coming back the TeleWarlocks way.”

At that moment Daisy began moving. She got up off the coffee table, and groggily waddled over to Ben.

“She’s back! She’s alive!” Ben said with glee.

A moment later, Daisy’s eyes began to glow, and took on a menacing red hue. She bit Ben and started furiously shaking her head, instantly mangling his already-scarred hand in a frenzy of blood and saliva.

Maggy stood up, and grabbed her Amazon Basics crystal amulet. It was imbued with the same amount of spiritual power as the expensive ones on Etsy, but she got it for like half the price.

“Agh my hand!” Ben exclaimed. “This doesn’t even make sense! Why would this be your business model?” he cried as Daisy’s eyes grew more red, and her body became larger. “How would you ever get repeat business if your customers are then-” Ben’s speech turned to gargling noise when Daisy bit down on his throat.

Maggy was holding her amulet chanting in latin.

The voice on speaker phone began again. “Trying a temporal shift spell? Not gonna work against TeleWarlocks’ patent pending *spellbind* proprietary spell system.” the voice said.

Daisy had killed Ben and was only growing larger. Maggy closed her eyes and continued her chant.

“TeleWarlocks, LLC is an unmatched-” Maggy grabbed the phone and threw it against the wall.

She had been trying to cast a powerful spell that would have pushed her back in time by 3 days. She still stood there, with a now horse-sized Daisy, who would soon be done eating Ben. Daisy turned to her with malice, as if the dog could feel Maggy’s attempt to return her to death.

With one large snap she bit Maggy’s head off, and leaped out the window. Towards her new masters.

What had been Ben’s phone sat in over a dozen pieces on the floor. The part that had been the speaker still had a faint sound coming from it: “Thank you for using TeleWarlocks LLC for all of your magic needs. Please stay on the line after this call to complete a short survey.”",1,1752605829.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I’m craving more color, personality, and decor! I’m tired of the empty walls and spaces but I don’t want things to feel cluttered. I also rearrange the couches and furniture in a way that opens up the space a bit more, if that’s even possible.

	•	Throw pillows — I’m looking to retire and replace the current pillows. Would love some that bring in bolder colors and textures and compliment the current rug and couches

	•	Layout — open to rearranging the couch and furniture to better fill the space

	•	Would love recs for rugs for the entryway, plants, and anything else that makes that space as well as the living room feel warm, lived-in, and stylish

**Subreddit:** r/LGBTQStories  

---  

### **The Setup:**  
So, I’ve been crushing on this guy, *Liam*, since forever. We’re in the same art class, and he’s this effortlessly cool, slightly mysterious guy who always wears band tees and draws these insane charcoal sketches. Problem? **I’m painfully shy.** My attempts at flirting have been limited to:  
- ""Nice… uh… shading on that apple.""  
- *Trips over stool while trying to sit near him.*  

### **The Desperation Move:**  
Last month, I found Liam’s Instagram (private account, of course). I noticed he followed a bunch of indie music pages, so I had a *genius* idea: **I’d make a fake fan account for his favorite band, DM him as a ""fellow fan,"" and slowly win him over online.**  

- **Fake Account Name:** *@MidnightEchoesFan* (his fav band)  
- **Strategy:** Like his posts, comment *""This song hits different""* on his Stories, slide into DMs with *""You have great taste!""*  

### **It Actually Worked… Too Well.**  
Liam started replying—**enthusiastically**. We talked about music for weeks. He even said:  
*""You’re the only person who gets my music taste. Wish I knew you IRL.""*  

**Cue my internal screaming.**  

### **The Plot Twist:**  
Then, disaster struck. Liam posted:  
*""Shoutout to @MidnightEchoesFan for being the coolest person I’ve never met. Anyone wanna help me find them? 👀""*  

**HE WAS TRYING TO TRACK DOWN *ME* (THE FAKE ME).**  

### **The Double Twist:**  
Our art teacher assigned a **collab project**. Guess who got paired together? **Liam and me.**  

First meeting, he looks at me and goes:  
*""You look… familiar. Do I know you?""*  

I panicked. *""Uh, we’re in the same class?""*  

He squints. *""No, it’s something else…""*  

Then—**HE SHOWED ME HIS PHONE.** My fake account’s DMs were open.  

*""This account follows *only* me and the band. And their comments always line up with when you’re looking at your phone in class.""*  

### **The Confession:**  
I turned tomato-red and blurted: *""Okay, I made it because I like you and didn’t know how to talk to you!""*  

Silence. Then—  

**HE LAUGHED.** *""Dude, you could’ve just said hi. Also, your fake account has *terrible* music takes. Wanna get coffee and argue about it?""*  

### **The Unexpected Ending:**  
Turns out, Liam had **suspected it was me** for weeks but played along because he thought it was ""kinda cute."" Now we’ve been dating for a month, and he *still* roasts my fake account’s DMs.  

**Moral of the story?** Catfishing is weirdly effective but maybe just **use your words next time.**  

---  

**TL;DR:** Made a fake fan account to flirt with my crush, he figured it out, and now we’re dating.

I messaged 11 days after the breakup and we met up around 14 days post breakup for a coffee and “closure” (became more confusing/vague - I feel it came from fear over some life changes we nearly faced but that’s a different story).

I then messaged for a few days until she asked for a “few weeks” no contact and we can talk it through again.

I messaged after a month and she seemed to be more cold but some messages seemed a bit more human, but more or less being strict with her decision which I was trying to respect but I was also very confused looking to see if we could chat it out.

We had a few messages over the next week or 2, very slow maybe a message each a day. She took to her narrative of “core issues” which were “unfixable”. At some point she stopped replying and didn’t answer my one call attempt. I sent a final message saying I loved her and I wish we could have worked it out but the door is always open.

I sort of regret the vulnerability in my last messages as it was coming from so much pain and to have been met with silence was crushing but I started to recover more from after sending that last long-ish message and that was around 6 weeks ago.

1m0q9q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodValue/comments/1m0q9q4/the_surprising_longevity_of_a_simple_coffee/,The Surprising Longevity of a Simple Coffee Grinder,"A couple of years ago, I got tired of replacing cheap plastic coffee grinders every 6–9 months. I enjoy pour-over coffee, and it became frustrating how fast the blades wore down or the motors burned out. So I decided to take the “buy a quality thing that can serve you for life” seriously and really research my next grinder.

After browsing reviews and deep-diving into minimalist setups, I came across a Japanese-style hand grinder on Alibaba. It was a brushed metal body, ceramic burrs, and fully manual. I was hesitant at first coz wasn’t sure if ordering directly would be worth the risk. But I came across a supplier that had great ratings and offered small-batch ordering with Trade Assurance. So I gave it a shot.

It’s been two years now. Still works like day one. No motors to burn out, no plastic parts to crack, and it feels solid every time I use it. I even travel with it now. It made me realize that buying long-lasting equipment doesn’t always mean dropping hundreds on a known brand. Sometimes, it means finding the right build quality, even if it means sourcing globally and doing a bit of vetting. 

Would love to hear about something you got that was really impressive.

🧠 Personality
Polost is a calm, stoic wanderer with a deep intellect and serious demeanor. Though soft-spoken, he can be cold and ruthless in battle. He acts like a mentor or teacher when first approached, often speaking in brief, wise phrases. A killer of madness, Polost hides despair behind a composed face. Despite his killer instincts, he shows kindness to those who prove themselves.

Once just an average man living in Japan, Polost grew bored with his mundane life. During a solitary mountain hike, he encountered the legendary King T. rex statue. Offered a lifetime journey, he accepted. His body changed — sprouting spider legs from his back — and he was pulled into the Apex World.

The transformation was painful, and he wandered for years alone. In his journey, he met Lalice (a quiet alien girl) and Atokie (a funny yet loyal guy). To survive the cruel world, he built the R Mega Spider.

He remained trapped in Apex World for 9 years, until J and his crew helped him return home. Though thankful, he didn’t show much emotion, staying quiet and distant.

1m0q7uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1m0q7uh/another_stall_post_stuck_at_50_down_with_50_to_go/,"Another stall post (stuck at 50 down, with >50 to go)","*F37 SW300 CW251 (LW257.5) GW Under 200*

TLDR: been stalled out hovering around 50 pounds lost for nearly 3 months now. Trying all the things to break the stall, and trying to focus more on gym strength gains, and I'm sure eventually the needle will start moving again, but this is incredibly frustrating, especially as someone who feels like a slow-responder and someone who has battled with weight for over 30 years.

\---

The long story:

* I've been on GLP-1s for a bit over a year and a half. 52.5 pounds lost, counting my ever-elusive low
* While my weight peaked around 300 pounds, my bloodwork was consistently otherwise all normal and I never hit pre-diabetes levels, and Insurance said LOL NO to any sort of coverage for weight loss.
* I started on semaglutide, and it took titrating up to the max dose to finally see regular progress (of 0.5-1 pound a week. It also took me about 3 months to lose my first 10 pounds (where was that water weight woosh I was promised?!).
* In February the FOMO took over, and I switched to tirzepatide. Had to titrate up to the max dose, then started seeing consistent weight loss of about 1 pound a week.
* Broke that 50 pound barrier and just CANNOT get past it.
* Been trying all the things over the past couple months: doubling down on precision food tracking; tried upping my calories to a maintenance range for a bit, too, researched all the stall-breaking advice, etc
   * I drink a ton of water (over 120 ounces a day)
   * I have been exercising regularly for over 3 years (currently, it's primarily a mix of Peloton spin classes, getting back into jogging, and strength training) - typically 5 days a week. Even on my off days, I'll usually get in walks - I close my watch 1-hour exercise ring every day, gym or not.
   * I've significantly increased my average daily step count in the past couple of years
   * I've significantly decreased my alcohol intake in the past few years too
* I could become stricter on my food intake (e.g. considering lowering carbs significantly, and lowering my daily calories even more) - but I am hesitant because I am really trying to make sustainable choices that I can maintain long-term.

On the one hand, I feel lucky that I have had minimal side effects. Some nausea at the beginning and heartburn on semaglutide. Minor constipation and minor nausea on tirz if I go too long without protein. Nothing that has caused me to puke, though. My only minor food aversion was coffee for a few months but that went away. Food noise has lessened, but I'll say phentermine gave me more appetite suppression. I still HAVE to be incredibly aware of my food choices and my portions every day.

Ignoring the stall, this is the first time in my life that I am not STARVING ALL THE TIME and actually seeing consistent progress whilst honestly tracking CICO. This is truly the biggest win. And I am reminding myself that the weight I'm stalled at right now is also the weight I kept going back to in my late 20s/early 30s, so if there's any validity in ""set weight"" concept, I can kind of get it. I've not been significantly lower than my current weight in close to a decade, so it *should* take time. And 50 pounds gone is amazing! I'm super healthy! And I'm hella strong! These are all good things!

On the other hand it's hard not to get a bit discouraged with such a stall, feeling like I am doing everything right and the already-slow progress grinding to a looooong halt, when I'm still looking at so much weight yet to lose.

It's also soooo curious to me how people react so vastly different to the meds. So many people feeling it on the introductory and lower doses, where for me...it was like I was taking sugar pills. I've not got a formal hormonal/metabolic diagnosis (my docs have suspected PCOS or some other similar disfunction, but we have never quite narrowed down a clinical diagnosis) but we are sure there has been something underlying that has caused me such struggle with my weight over the past few decades. (Cue the ""just eat less and move more"" from an old doc when I was a competitive high school swimmer training multiple hours a day and eating balanced meals...eye roll). I do think the GLP is helping to fix some sort of disfunction/imbalance in my body, so it feels worth it, even without significant scale progress.

Anyway, I'm hoping this little vent sesh gets the negativity out of my body a bit more, so I can go back to doing the right things with less personal crankiness and eventually see the progress again. Thank you for reading. High fives to all, especially those who are dealing with a very rude stall at the moment. The struggle is real.",5,1752605405.0,tirzepatidecompound,16,0.78,False

""Good morning."" I wrapped my fingers around my coffee mug, glancing at my mate across the breakfast table.

Ronan Cross sat there studying me in nothing but a thin nightgown, his amber eyes still burning with that primal hunger from full moon.

""Morning."" I set down my cup, reminding him, ""Don't you have that pack meeting today?""

""Yeah."" Ronan smirked, pushing back from his chair and stalking over to me. ""The boys can wait for their Luna. Besides, we're working on the pack's heir.""

Before I could say anything, his mouth crashed against mine, tongue demanding entry as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.

My knees went weak as I breathed against his lips, ""Ronan...""

He cleared the table with one sweep of his arm, plates crashing to the floor. Then freed his cock, the tip already slick as he positioned himself between my spread legs.

I wrapped my legs around his waist, meeting each of his powerful thrusts as he pounded into me.

After thirty minutes, Ronan buried himself deep and came hard inside me.

He kissed me lazily, then gave my ass a firm squeeze. ""Meeting shouldn't take long. I'll bring the guys back for dinner ."" His voice softened slightly: ""And babe? Don’t forget your antidepressants.""

I rolled my eyes, tugging my nightgown back down. ""Such a nag.""

He flashed those sharp canines in a grin before heading out to the pack house. I stayed slumped against the table, legs still trembling, but smiling despite myself.

I prepared a small gathering for him and Rowan, his beta.

Later that night, when his beta arrived, I went to change my clothes—only to overhear their conversation.

At the dinner table, Ronan’s beta suddenly switched to Italian.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira. I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?""

Ronan paused, his face clouded with a complex expression before a wry, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life.""

No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said.

I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'

So all the love he showed me… was only a lie.

What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap.

I didn't hesitate. I swallowed the pills—they tasted more bitter than ever before.

The conversation at the dinner table continued, Rowan's voice low and heavy with guilt

“Forget the whole pup situation for a second—three years ago, when Mira jumped into that river, Lyra’s mom dove in to save her. But Mira shoved her under and let her drown. Ronan, come on, the footage was clear as day. She did it on purpose. Lyra had every right to take it to the pack court.”

""But you became Lyra's legal guardian just to keep Mira out of prison. You signed that settlement behind Lyra's back. Sure, Mira walked free, but Lyra's been drowning in depression ever since. She blames herself every single day. If she ever learns the truth, it'll destroy her completely.""

Ronan's eyes flashed with irritation, but his voice stayed cold and firm. ""Mira didn't mean it. She was drowning—those movements were just instinct. She regrets it too.""

""I've hidden those documents well. Lyra will never know the truth. I'll be good to her, spend my life making it up to her, give her a home. She'll forget the pain. She'll heal.""

Rowan sighed. “Look, don’t blow up—I just feel bad for Lyra, that’s all. You showed up when she was at rock bottom, and of course she fell for you. But you were never over Mira.”

“Whatever, man. Just... hope you can live with this secret. And I hope you won't regret it.”

Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""

That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.

Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.

Just this morning, Ronan had fucked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.

Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.

I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.

All those buried memories came flooding back.

Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.

Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's bastard daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.

So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.

That's how my mother drowned.

When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""

I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.

I sued her for murder.

But the next day, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it, eyes red, barely dry from crying.

“Evan ?” I asked, caught off guard by his sudden visit. “Are you here for my mother’s funeral?”

He stood outside, cold and distant, his voice like a blade:

“No,” he said, standing at the threshold. “Listen carefully. I, Evan Locke, Alpha of the Locke Pack, reject you, Lyra Hale, to be my mate and future Luna.”

Chapter 2

“What?” I froze, struck as if by lightning, unable to move. “What are you doing?”

“Accept it.” He ignored my question, “Take my rejection.”

Evan’s voice was cold, without a trace of hesitation or mercy. The eyes that once gazed at me so tenderly were now colder than Arctic snow.

“NOW.”

A chill swept over me. Suppressed by his Alpha bloodline, I could only obey. “I accept your rejection.”

The moment the mate bond snapped, my wolf let out a sorrowful howl—as if her soul had been torn apart.

I thought my tears had long dried up, yet they slid down silently once more.

“Why?” My voice came out hoarse.

Evan lowered his eyes, his tone still as cold and cutting as ice: “I won’t allow you to harm Mira.”

That single sentence sent me plummeting into the abyss.

He didn’t just break off our engagement. Before the eyes of the entire pack, he sealed the mate bond with Mira. That day, the whole pack celebrated their union, while I was cast out, becoming the laughingstock of the pack.

Then the pack erupted with rumors—that I was using my mother's death for sympathy, for attention, for power.

They called me jealous, said that's why my mate rejected me.

The pressure nearly suffocated me. I had a complete breakdown and developed severe depression.

But I never gave up seeking justice for my mother.

My mother cared for me, protected me for twenty-three years. How could I abandon her?

That's when Ronan began his relentless pursuit.

Such careful attention, such devoted protection.

I saw him as my salvation and accepted his claim.

After our mating ceremony, the court found Mira innocent.

So I tried to let go, I wanted his pup. I just... wanted us to feel like a real family.”

I never imagined that my salvation was just proof of his love for Mira all along.

Ronan appeared beside me, holding an umbrella over my head.

## #1: [Bounty Of One](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bountyofone.premium.mobile.gp)

You know Vampire Survivors? This is an okay-ish mobile port of a wild west themed copycat!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.0.202: **[Combat](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-bounty-1.jpg) | [Mineshaft](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-bounty-2.jpg) | [Upgrades](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-bounty-3.jpg)**

### Review

I've got mixed feelings about Bounty Of One. On the one hand, the dopamine rush of mowing down hundreds of zombies(?) and picking upgrades and perks is undeniably satisfying. On the other hand, there's not much depth or difficulty despite all the perks and upgrades and gamemodes, and everything outside of the main game is awkward on mobile.

This isn't a particularly hard game if you've spent any time in bullet hell games, or those with the concept of ""kiting"" enemies. Keep moving and briefly stand still to autoshoot, avoid getting trapped by a horde, then circle back around and collect your loot. Repeat until you run out of life or kill enough bosses to win. The only slight quirk is having a ""dash"" skill that moves you forward, helping to escape particularly bad situations.

Whilst I do appreciate the 4 included game modes, they're all ultimately the same. Regular mode, regular mode with a time incentive, a horizontal only mode, and a small area mode. The gameplay doesn't change, only the (bland, empty) arena. The coins dropped by enemies give you XP, used to gain upgrades. Killing a harder enemy drops a chest, which has an object containing a choice of a few unique perks.

The upgrades and perks are primarily simple things like extra life, attack speed, move speed, damage, etc. Luckily, there's a solid mixture of interesting perks. They vary from projectile modifiers like bounce and penetration ot area changers like slowing enemies near you and damage amplifying lenses, to game changers like tripling your shots or firing behind you.

In addition to these, there are 12 characters to choose from, each starting with a significant perk (that can also be unlocked during a run). For example, ""ROB3RT 0.3"" has a constant turret but halved attack speed, whilst Tara has a small companion that collects coins to charge a high damage lazer. Unlocking these requires completing slightly challenging feats such as not moving for 60 seconds or winning at a certain difficulty.

The boss battles are decent, with multi-stage bosses requiring dodging attacks and tactical movements. However, once you've killed the 3-4 different bosses once they're not a challenge, with a no-damage kill being pretty easy next time you encounter them.

Outside the actual gameplay, the UI is clearly not made for mobile. Text is genuinely hard to see, requiring peering very closely to read the tiny characters, and presumably unreadable on smaller screens. Luckily, you won't spend much of your time in these other menus (such as a simple permanent perk shop), since there's not much there.

After a few playthroughs you'll generally know which of these perks works well with your style of gameplay, and typically win every game. There's an ""infamy level"" system (harder rules, but higher score) but this doesn't have a major impact if you have strong object synergy.

I've played perhaps 7-8 runs, winning 5, experienced every enemy and most objects, unlocked 11/12 characters and around half the achievements. Each of these runs takes around 15 minutes of gameplay, so within a few hours I've unfortunately seen everything the game has to offer (according to the in-game encyclopedia). Fun, but perhaps not for too long.

### Monetisation

I played this as part of Google Play Pass, I believe it is around $5 otherwise (with extra for DLCs that are included in Play Pass).

### Tips

1. Move in a wide circle if you can, stopping in sync with your attack, so you can deal constant damage and also collect all the coins.
2. When picking an upgrade, higher quality colours (e.g. legendary yellow) are almost always the correct choice.
3. Health is all that ultimately matters. As such, I try to get up to around 8 max health, and focus on anything that offers passive healing or vampire healing. After that, I focus on attack speed to avoid getting cornered.
4. Make sure you keep your damage upgraded enough to one-hit standard enemies. Without this, you'll be swarmed quite badly.
5. Personally, I found the mineshaft gamemode the most fun, with the horizontal-only gameplay forcing a bit of challenge into a playthrough. The ""dynamite bombardment"" event was the highest challenge experience I had in the game, and I'd have loved to see more of this.

## #2: [Homo Machina](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ArteExperience.HomoMachina)

This is an educational game about your body, but more game than education!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.6.38: **[Nose](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-homo-1.jpg) | [Ear](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-homo-2.jpg) | [About](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-homo-3.jpg)**

### Review

Humanising your body as being controlled by smaller sentient beings is nothing new, I read _tons_ of it in [comics as a kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Numskulls)! However, Homo Machina provides a very sleek internal experience of a typical day, starting with waking up, and ending with a date.

Every step of the day, from smelling coffee and identifying it, to focusing on the date partner opposite, is presented as a standalone level. These involve solving a small puzzle to make the body part work, such as figuring out how to focus the eye's lens, or responding to nervous system triggers.

None of these are challenging, but they are all animated very well, and it's clear a lot of effort has been put into presentation. Whilst you're unlikely to learn anything knew from Homo Machina, it is a reasonable ""first glance"" introduction to some of the human body's parts, and could interest a younger audience in the topic.

A playthrough won't take more than half hour, with no replayability, but I'm glad educational experiences like this still get funded, despite it almost inevitably not gaining a large audience or making much revenue. Instead, it's a fun little experience for anyone who stumbles across it and decided to pay up.

### Monetisation

One-off payment of £2.49 (~$3.49), currently £1.49 (~$1.99).

### Tips

No need for tips, just solve each puzzle!

## #3: [MERGE KITCHEN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FATSTAR.MergeKitchen)

This Japanese merge / wave-defense game is a short and repetitive item merging experience made trivial by Google Play Pass, but I can't deny there's something enjoyable about it!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.203: **[Map](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-merge-1.jpg) | [Combat](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-merge-2.jpg) | [Combat 2](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-merge-3.jpg) | [Challenge mode](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-merge-4.jpg)**

### Review

MERGE KITCHEN is one of those games where you'll see pretty much the entire thing within the first 120 seconds.

Wait for items to spawn in your grid, merge them to create units, send them into a realtime battle against a flood of enemies alongside occasional special attacks (Healer, Wizard, etc). Win the level, earn currency to upgrade, play a harder level. And repeat.

The upgrades available are fairly typical for a merge game. Unlocking higher merge tiers, increasing unit strength, and decreasing the 2-hour timer to gain free currency. Interestingly, due to Google Play Pass providing all bonuses, you'll gain a _ton_ of resources per level win and rarely have to retry. This means you can upgrade enough between each level to beat the next level, removing any sense of progression or difficulty.

As the spawn timer for tile begins as soon as it is empty, you are incentivised to instantly merge whenever possible to maximise your items. This means you'll spend your time ignoring the top half of the screen and just blindly merging identical items until they hit max level, then throwing them into the battle. With a level typically lasting 2-3 minutes, you'll be ""in the zone"" and suddenly interrupted by the level complete screen!

There are 50 levels, organised into packs of 5, so a full playthrough will take around 1.5-2 hours. After game completion there's a ""challenge mode"" which plays like a time-limited version of the entire game, offering upgrades in-level after enough kills. This is a nice addition, but the gameplay is still almost identical to the main game so doesn't provide much incentive unless you're already a massive fan.

Visuals are consistently high quality throughout, although there's not much variety in enemies. Essentially everything walks forward and melee attacks, with your units luckily having more variety with range units (witch) staying behind the battle frontline.

MERGE KITCHEN does have a story, told via short cutscenes every few levels, but it's fairly skippable. Whilst not as cliché as other games, it features a fairly melodramatic (and sometimes clunky) writing style revealing the creator's Japanese origin. Similarly, a few phrases in the app will display in Japanese, as will the app name, but this doesn't hinder gameplay.

### Monetisation

It's hard to say! It's free through Play Pass, but I believe there would be a fair amount of grinding otherwise unless purchasing the Ad-Free pack for an unknown price.

### Tips

1. You can drag to merge without slowing down, so a single swipe can upgrade multiple tiers.
2. Item respawn timers still count whilst a special unit animation is playing, so use these as soon as they spawn to gain extra items.
3. Unlocking new tiers of unit will mean it takes longer for your (stronger) units to enter the battlefield. Make sure you don't unlock too many tiers at once.
4. Similarly, if the enemy is getting close to your base throw out any units you have, even if under max level, to buy some time.

## #4: [Bird Alone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GeorgeBatchelor.BirdAlone)

Want a friend AND a bird, without any of the hassle or commitment? Here's Bird Alone!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 4.3: **[Making music](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-bird-1.jpg) | [Conversation](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-bird-2.jpg) | [Poems](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/july-bird-3.jpg)**

### Review

I'm hesitant to call Bird Alone game. It's more of an art experience / tamagotchi / story combination.

Once you've introduced yourself and named your bird, you'll spend 1-2 minutes with it daily over a 3-4 week period. In these sessions, your bird will ask to talk to you. It will then ask to make music together, finish a poem, draw some art, plant flowers, or answer philosophical questions.

Whilst these can start off pretty easy, asking how your day was, they quickly escalate into love, death, change, and genuinely thoughtful comments. The writing is mature and intelligent enough to overcome the fact that it is coming from a stylised parrot. At times it can overstep slightly (e.g. declaring love) or perhaps be a bit too intense, but this is always a risk with anything philosophical.

Bird Alone is more of a thought of the day app than a game, and whilst this can be enjoyable, it scratches a different itch. Without spoilers, your bird will grow older and mature, and dwell on what that means.

It's worth a playthrough if you have any interest in philosophy or more mature themes, and is fairly well-made (if a little simple).

### Monetisation

I played Bird Alone as part of Google Play Pass, I believe it is $2.99 otherwise.

### Tips

None needed, this is a linear experience.

1m0q6c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m0q6c7/the_breaking_point_of_love/,The Breaking Point of Love,"When Celeste Rodriguez arrived at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.

It was her birthday that day. Therefore, she received a bunch of birthday wishes from her colleagues and friends when she turned on her phone.

However, there was no message from her husband, Trevor Fleming, at all.

Celeste's smile faded.

By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.

Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper, was startled when she saw her. ""Oh, Mrs. Fleming… Why have you come here?""

""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked.

""Mr. Fleming hasn't returned yet, and Ms. Fleming is in her room, playing,"" Hannah replied.

Celeste handed her luggage to Hannah. When she went upstairs, she found Jordyn wearing a pair of pajamas and sitting at her table, fiddling with something. She was so focused that she didn't even notice anyone entering the room.

""Jo?"" Celeste called out.

Jordyn turned her head when she heard her. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""

Then, she turned back to her task.

Celeste walked over and pulled Jordyn into her arms. She had just given Jordyn a kiss on the cheek before the little one pushed her away.

""Mom, I'm busy right now.""

It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.

But upon seeing how focused Jordyn was, Celeste felt like she shouldn't disrupt her enthusiasm. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""

""Mm-hm!"" When Celeste asked about that, Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. This is the birthday gift Dad and I are preparing for her. We carefully polished these shells with tools. Aren't they pretty?""

Celeste's throat tightened. Before she could say anything, she heard Jordyn, with her back still turned, happily say, ""Dad even had a customized gift prepared for Wynn. Tomorrow—""

Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo… Do you remember it's my birthday today?""

""Huh? What?"" Jordyn glanced up at her, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands. She complained, ""Mom, don't talk to me. You're messing up the bead order—""

Celeste released her hold on Jordyn and said nothing more. She stood there for a long time, but Jordyn didn't look up at her even once. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without a word.

When Hannah saw her, she said, ""I just called Mr. Fleming. He said he has something to do tonight and told you to rest first.""

""I see."" Celeste acknowledged her words softly.

As she thought about what Jordyn had just said, she paused for a bit and called Trevor.

It took a long while before he answered, his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow—""

""Trevor, who's calling you so late?"" It was Wynn's voice.

Celeste tightened her grip on her phone.

""It's nothing important,"" Trevor responded to Wynn's question.

Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.

The two of them hadn't seen each other in two or three months, and she had finally made it to Andostan. Not only did he not rush home to see her, but he also didn't even have the patience to finish one phone call with her.

After so many years of marriage, he had always been like this—cold, distant, and impatient.

Celeste had gotten used to it.

In the past, she would have called him again. Then, she would patiently ask where he was and whether he could come home. Perhaps she was too tired tonight. So, she suddenly didn't feel like doing so.

The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.

There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.

She didn't come to Andostan just to see Jordyn and Trevor. She hoped their family of three could spend this special day together by having a meal.

This was her birthday wish for the year.

Yet, Trevor didn't answer her call.

A long time later, he sent a message: ""What's up?""

Celeste wrote: ""Do you have time at noon? Let's bring Jo along and have lunch together as a family.""

Trevor replied: ""Okay. Let me know the address when it's decided.""

Celeste texted back: ""Alright.""

After that, there was no further message from him. He hadn't remembered it was her birthday at all. Although Celeste was mentally prepared, she couldn't help feeling a pang of disappointment.

She was about to head downstairs after washing up when she overheard Jordyn and Hannah talking.

""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, Ms. Fleming?"" Hannah asked.

Jordyn said, ""Dad and I already promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes along, it'll be so awkward. And Mom is so mean. She's always unkind to Wynn—""

""Ms. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming is your mother. You shouldn't say such things. You'll hurt her feelings, you know?""

""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""

Hannah didn't know what to say to that.

Whatever she said afterward, Celeste couldn't hear it anymore.

She had raised Jordyn herself. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.

Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.

She hadn't expected this.

Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. She was unable to move for a long time. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.

Now, it seemed unnecessary.

She returned to her room. Then, she repacked the gifts she had brought from home and put them back into her suitcase.

Later, Hannah called to say she had taken Jordyn out to play and to contact her if anything came up.

Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.

Her arrival was nothing but a joke.

After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she wandered through this foreign yet familiar country.

By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.

Then, she suddenly received a message from Trevor that read: ""Something came up at noon. Lunch is canceled.""

Celeste stared at the message, unsurprised.

She was used to this. In Trevor's world, work, friends, and everything else were more important than her, his wife. Plans made with her were always canceled at his whim without consideration for her feelings.

Was she disappointed? Perhaps she would have been in the past. Now, she just felt numb and couldn't feel anything anymore.

Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.

Before she realized it, she had driven to a restaurant she and Trevor used to frequent. Just as she was about to go in, she saw Trevor, Wynn, and Jordyn sitting together inside.

Wynn sat close to Jordyn on the same side. She chatted with Trevor while interacting with Jordyn playfully. Jordyn, with her legs swinging around happily, played with Wynn and even leaned in to eat the pastries Wynn had taken a bite out of.

Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them. His gaze never left Wynn as if she were the only one he could see in his eyes.

So, this was what Trevor meant when he said that something had come up. This was the daughter she had carried in her body for ten months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.

Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned away and left.

Back at the villa, Celeste prepared a divorce agreement.

Trevor had been her teenage dream, but he had never truly seen or paid attention to her.

If not for that accidental night and the pressure from his grandfather, Arnold Fleming, Trevor wouldn't have married her.

In the past, she had naïvely believed that if she worked hard enough, he would eventually acknowledge and see her.

Unfortunately, the reality was harsh and dealt a cruel blow to her.

Almost seven years had passed, so it was time to wake up.

After placing the divorce agreement in an envelope and instructing Hannah to hand it to Trevor, Celeste dragged her suitcase to the car and said to the driver, ""To the airport.""

Chapter 2

At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.

Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.

But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.

Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.

Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""

""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.

In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.

In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.

""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""

Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""

""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.

Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""

""Yes.""

Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.

Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.

Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt—she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.

Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.

She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""

Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.

""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.

In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.

Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.

Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.

A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.

That night, Trevor didn't return home.

The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.

…

Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.

After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.

However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.

In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.

Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.

Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.

Now, there were over three million in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.

She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.

Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.

Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.

After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.

…

The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.

When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.

Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.

At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.

The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.

Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.

…

Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.

He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.

Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.

She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.

Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""

Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!

…

After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.

The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.

Chapter 3

Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.

He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.

Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.

To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.

Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.

At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.

On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her conception, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.

Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.

Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to—it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.

While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""

""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.

After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.

""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing—""

Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.

But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.

And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.

Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.

When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.

Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.

Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""

Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""

Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.

With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.

…

""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.

Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""

""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""

""No, not today.""

Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day—once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.

Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.

After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.

After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.

After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""

""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""

The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.

Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.

""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.

There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.

Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.

Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.

Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.

While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.

So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.

For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.

Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.

…

Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.

That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.

Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""

Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""

At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""

""When did you find out?""

""It's been a while.""

""Dad, you're so mean…"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""

Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""

Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""

""We're going back next week.""

Chapter 4

Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""

""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.

""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""

""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""

Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""

""Alright.""

""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""

After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.

After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.

But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.

At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.

After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.

As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.

But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.

This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.

It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.

Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.

When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.

Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.

Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""

Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""

When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.

After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""

Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.

Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.

After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.

The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.

On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.

""All set. Let's go.""

The car departed from the villa and headed to the airport.

…

Celeste had no idea that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. No one had told her.

Half a month had passed since she moved out of the villa. During that time, she had gradually grown used to and even fond of the peace and leisure of living alone.

It was the weekend, and she woke up late. After freshening up, she opened the curtains to a sunny day. She stretched lazily, watered her plants, and was about to make herself a simple breakfast when the doorbell rang.

It was her neighbor, Tilda Emery, who lived across from her.

""Ms. Rodriguez, I hope I'm not intruding,"" Tilda said apologetically.

Celeste replied warmly, ""Not at all, I was already up.""

""That's good,"" Tilda said enthusiastically. ""These buns and pastries are fresh out of the oven. I just made them this morning, and I brought some over for you to try.""

""Thank you. It's so kind of you to do this, Mrs. Golden,"" Celeste said.

""It's the least we could do. If it weren't for you saving Sylvia from that rabid dog the other day, who knows how badly hurt she might have been? My husband and I have been wanting to thank you properly for saving our girl, but work has kept us busy. We felt so bad about it.""

""It was nothing, Mrs. Golden. Don't mention it.""

After a few more pleasantries, Tilda left.

Back inside, Celeste ate breakfast while studying the algorithm of an AI she had been researching.

Later that day, a news notification about Trellis College's centennial celebration popped up on her phone. Celeste paused to check the date and realized that it was indeed Trellis College's 100th-year anniversary.

She browsed the news online and saw several trending hashtags about the event. The celebration was receiving high attention, not only because Trellis College was the top educational institute in the country but also because this was its first centennial celebration.

Many distinguished alumni had been invited back to the alma mater for the event. Those honorary alumni were highly regarded figures in various fields.

Celeste stared at the screen for a while. When she saw several familiar faces in the photos, her hand trembled slightly. Memories of her time at college flooded her mind. Her heart became unsettled.

If she hadn't gotten married right after graduating with her bachelor's degree, she might have been among those honored alumni invited back for this event.

Celeste closed her laptop and hesitated briefly before driving to Trellis College.

It was already late in the evening when she arrived. Many of the high-profile attendees had already left, but the campus was still bustling.

Celeste wandered aimlessly and eventually found herself near the familiar lab building.

A familiar voice called out to her. ""Cel?""

…

20 minutes later, at a cafe outside Trellis College, Matthias Yoder poured her a cup of coffee.

""How have you been lately?"" he asked.

Holding the cup, Celeste smiled faintly with her gaze lowered. ""I'm doing well. It's just that… I'm currently preparing for a divorce.""

Matthias hadn't expected such a response. He paused for a while before saying, ""I'm sorry to hear that.""

""It's alright.""

""What's next? Are you planning to return to the company?""

""I am, but…""

Matthias couldn't understand why she was hesitating. He said earnestly. ""Cel, the company needs you. You're a part of it, so I hope you'll come back to take charge.""

""But I… I…"" Celeste felt conflicted when she saw his serious expression.

It wasn't that she didn't want to return. The AI field had advanced rapidly, and she had been out of the industry for six years. Even if she went back now, she feared she wouldn't be able to keep up with the times, let alone lead the company and be at the forefront of the industry as she once had.

Chapter 5

Over the years, Matthias and Celeste had rarely seen each other. Yet, even from just a few encounters, Matthias could tell that she was no longer the confident and spirited person she had once been.

Matthias thought back to the Celeste he knew from the past. He could never have associated the word ""insecure"" with that individual. He didn't know much about Celeste's marriage to Trevor, but he was completely clueless about her sorry state which was essentially an open secret.

He had his suspicions but didn't voice them. Instead, he sincerely encouraged, ""Falling behind for a time doesn't matter. Your ability and talent surpass that of most geniuses. As long as you're still passionate about this field, it's never too late to start again.

""Don't forget that you were our teacher's favorite student throughout his entire career.""

Celeste smiled as she listened to him. ""If he heard that, he'd probably scoff and say that he didn't have much of a choice and could only settle on the least bad one.""

As she thought of her wise but sharp-tongued mentor, Celeste's smile faltered. ""I saw on the news earlier that he also came back for the celebration. How has he been?""

""He's doing well, though he's often annoyed by us—his ever-disappointing students—popping up in front of him from time to time,"" Matthias replied.

Celeste chuckled, her mind wandering back to the days when she toiled away working on thesis papers under her mentor every day.

""Come back, Cel,"" Matthias urged.

Celeste gripped her cup tightly. After taking a deep breath, she nodded and said, ""Alright.""

She had been passionate about artificial intelligence since she was a child, and she loved anything related to this field. But because of her love for Trevor, she had put her dream on hold for seven years.",1,1752605308.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

	•	Throw pillows — I’m looking to retire and replace the current pillows. Would love some that bring in bolder colors and textures and compliment the current rug and couches
	•	Layout — open to rearranging the couch and furniture to better fill the space

My shift at work is supposed to be 2 pm until 11 pm but we always stay late. I didn't get off of work until after 3:30 am last night. We are always staying at least until midnight but also as late as 3 or 4 am.

I need to go grocery shopping. I need to fix a part on my truck which is leaking gas. Replacing the part should only take about an hour to maybe two, but I can't get a couple hours during the week to do it because work expects me to come in at 2 pm, stay until 3 am, then I end up not being able to sleep until 5; and there really isn't much you can do between 3 am and 5 am except buy cigarettes and gas or fast food. And then I need 8 hours of sleep, so I end up waking up at 1 pm.

Oh, and Saturdays are being made mandatory. So Sunday is the only day we'll be getting for rest.

And I'm still going to be late. I always seem to end up being at least 5 to 10 minutes late. I need a few more minutes to get ready, or to catch a couple extra Z's, but never enough time to actually do any of the things I need to do.

That's only if I sacrifice sleep. I was using energy drinks every day. It helped offset the sluggishness of being physically exhausted from the type of work we do. They would also make me unable to sleep for more than 5 hours at a time. I knew this couldn't be healthy for me, so I stopped. Now I can get so tired that I will fall asleep on the forklift, or start to fall asleep standing up. No one seems to care. We work with heavy machinery. We have to drive home at night. Why wouldn't my boss see how tired I am and suggest I go home or take a quick nap? He just suggests I go to a doctor because I shouldn't be that tired.

I just can't believe this is what is expected of me and no one is going to come save me. I've complained to my boss, I've complained to his boss, I've complained to his boss. I've told them that my work-life balance isn't being respected. They just shake their heads, say sorry, and then that's it.

I’m a 30-year-old Japanese-American woman living in Los Angeles — confident, warm, witty, and a little old-fashioned when it comes to romance. I love meaningful conversation, spontaneous city adventures, great food, beach sunsets, and the kind of spark that comes from genuine connection.

**What I’m looking for:**

* Men **29–38 years old**, **single** (not “it’s complicated”)
* Based **in Los Angeles** — I’m looking for something local, not long-distance
* Emotionally mature, intentional, kind, curious, and ready to meet in real life
* Someone who values communication, follow-through, and is excited about exploring what’s possible

I’m not interested in endless messaging or pen pals — I’d love to meet someone who knows what they want and is open to seeing where this could go. Let’s grab coffee, wander Abbot Kinney, check out a museum, or just get lost in great conversation.

**When you message:** Please include a recent **photo**, a little about yourself, and what you’re looking for. Low-effort or one-line messages won’t get a response — I’m looking for someone who’s as intentional as I am.

If this resonates with you, I look forward to hearing from you. Let’s see if we can write our own LA love story.",1,1752605019.0,r4r,1,0.6,False

Both cups were 20g, 320ml, and 95C. As I learned yesterday when brewing this bean with the V4, it is seemingly very dense and I had to go super coarse. First brew was 6M on a Vario W+ and then 7M the second time around.

Despite going so coarse, it was still a pretty slow brew with 5x even pours finishing around 5 min. I was at 5M yesterday with the V4 and had similarly long draw downs, so I’m assuming this is due to the bean density.

The flavor is definitely very currant forward with a lot of the spice notes that you can have in currants. The finish was jammy and fruity with a lingering spice. It had less acidity than the V4 and a more rounded body.

I think I prefer the spiced notes I’m getting in the Z1 to the acidity from the V4 for this particular bean. I’m excited to try it out with more beans. For someone new to pour overs, I can’t complain about either cup from the Z1 so far. It seems like they tried to make it as fool proof as possible to use. 

My gripes so far is that it’s a bit narrow at the top to pour ground coffee into yet too wide at the base to where it won’t fit on my Hario servers. Thankfully the Z1 bundle basically included a free server. ",2,1752604633.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Infosec - Dont FAIL your exam, mindset, 8/10  
Gwen B. from Tactical Security quick tips, also nice 8/10

Kelly Handerhan - Why you will pass 7/10

APPS:  
DestCert - Tests only, no flash cards etc 6/10   
LearnZapp  - to learn technical stuff ok, anything else NO !   
QE - 10/10. I was kinda worried about the pricing, but many posts were pointing out that is GOOD.  
And to be honest... it is. There are some downpoints, but all in all: I DON'T know HOW other ppl pass at 100Q without it!

Wording, style, are quite as close as they can be to the original questions.   
If you learn how to read the questions, and QE tests you hard way - you are half way done.  
I did about: 20x 10Q, 4x100Q, 3x CAT. A the end i was 60-70%.   
Don't have problems with time management, but you NEED to test yourself about it.   
At my 1st try the only tests i was doing was LearnZapp and... i went to 150Q and failed at 4 domains.   
I had the PoM so the 1st try was just to see how it goes (exam was after 1 month of studying).

More info on PREP:  
2-3h daily for 1.5 month. Driving, at bed, in the toilet, whenever i had moment - tests, testt/cram videos.  
I work full time (sometimes at weekends too) and have 2 kids ;)

EXAM:  
PLEASE READ!  
DO NOT THINK LIKE A MANAGER - REALLY - this is outdated in my opinion.   
Half of my questions today was doing tech stuff, even when in DRP/BCP/SDCL if i didn't know the material i would be toasted!  
1. Understand the question. Read it carefully, one word can change everything and i mean not only the words FIRST, MOST ETC. Small words: mitigate/detect/prevent etc (QE tests you on that).  
2. Read ALL the answers.   
3. Read the question and the answers again.  
4. Eliminate at least 1, or 2.   
5. Think ""end goal"".

More tips:  
\- leave real world outsite. CISSP / CBK and 4 answers are your world.  
\- just answer the question, know your role and what they as of you.

And... that's it.   
I wish you good luck on your exams and I hope this post will help you on your journey ! :>

1m0prmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m0prmf/forgotten_once_gone_forever/,"Forgotten Once, Gone Forever","Chapter 1

I imagined my graduation marking a bright new chapter—achievement, celebration, love. But instead of standing beside me, Caleb, the man I trusted most, spent the day in the arms of someone he once called ""just a friend.""

Shattered, I wandered into a bar, desperate for escape. I never expected that night to end in darkness—my drink tampered with, my body violated, my voice ignored. And with that horror, I lost a life I hadn’t yet told him about: our unborn child.

The hospital walls couldn’t contain the truth. A live stream revealed it all—Caleb’s betrayal, Bianca’s smug smile, their mockery of my pain. The life I thought I had with him? It was a lie.

He used to say I’d fall apart without him.

But this time, I’m walking away—not broken, but rebuilding. And I won’t be looking back.

\--

The hospital ceiling above me was blank—white, cold, unforgiving. I lay there, aching from the inside out, a thousand invisible cracks spider-webbed through every part of me. My physical wounds were painful, yes—but they were nothing compared to the weight pressing down on my chest, the kind that made it hard to even breathe.

For a while, I stared at the empty chair beside me, waiting—naively—for Caleb to walk through that door. I imagined his arms wrapping around me, his voice trembling as he asked if I was okay. But he never came. He wasn’t coming.

I tried to call him. The line rang, over and over, but he didn’t pick up. A piece of me still hoped he didn’t know what had happened, that maybe—just maybe—he’d come running once he did. But when I opened my secret Instagram account and saw the live video, any sliver of hope I had left turned to ash.

There he was. My boyfriend of over a year. Holding Bianca like she was his prize. She smiled with smug satisfaction, draped across him as if she’d won.

And maybe she had.

“Hey, Caleb,” someone behind the camera laughed. “What would your girl think if she saw this?”

“She’d believe whatever I told her,” he replied with a lazy smirk. “She always does.”

I felt the betrayal physically. My stomach twisted, and my vision blurred as the phone slipped from my hand.

Just last night, I was fighting for my life. I had gone to a bar alone—broken and humiliated because Caleb ditched my graduation celebration. I drank to forget, unaware someone had spiked my drink. By the time I realized, it was too late. The men dragged me away like I was nothing more than a forgotten possession.

My body had failed me. I had screamed in my mind, but no words would come. I managed to call Caleb, desperate for help.

""Help me,"" I had whispered.

He didn’t believe me. He didn’t even hesitate.

""Stop pretending,” he said. “You’re just upset I wasn’t there.”

Then came Bianca’s voice—seductive, cruel. “Should I take off the lingerie now?” she teased.

And that was it. The call ended. I was left alone, surrounded by monsters, deprived of power and dignity.

But the worst part wasn’t even the physical violation. It was what I lost that night—something no one knew about yet. I had been carrying a secret inside me, a new life. I was going to tell Caleb after graduation. I had imagined him smiling, holding me, whispering promises for our future. But that moment never came.

Instead, I lost the baby I had barely begun to love.

I lay in a cold, unfamiliar field afterward, blood-soaked and broken, and thought I might die. Maybe I wanted to.

But I didn’t. I woke up. I survived.

And as I stared at that empty chair in the hospital, I realized something: I couldn’t keep waiting for someone who had already chosen to leave.

So I picked up the phone again. This time, with purpose.

“Mom,” I said.

“Rhea? Sweetheart, are you okay?”

“I’m going to take the job in Sydney. Please help me get out of here.”

It was the beginning of the end—and the start of something new.

I wasn’t going to waste another minute on Caleb or the dream I used to cling to. I would rebuild myself, piece by piece, no matter how long it took.

Because he had abandoned me at my lowest.

But I?

I would rise.

Chapter 2

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, even as I curled tighter beneath the hospital blanket. Every time I closed my eyes, the memories stormed back like a flood I couldn’t contain—the cruel chuckles, the rough hands, the helplessness pressing down on me until I could barely breathe. I gripped the edge of the sheet, forcing air into my lungs, trying to steady myself. I kept whispering in my head, You’re okay. You’re safe now. But it didn’t feel true.

I was surviving, but I wasn’t really living. I was still alone in this fight.

At some point, exhaustion must have pulled me under. When I opened my eyes again, it wasn’t because of a nightmare—it was because someone was touching me.

Fear shot through my veins like ice. My muscles tensed, and before I could think, I shoved the hand away with every ounce of strength I had.

“Whoa! Rhea, it’s me—it’s just me,” a voice said quickly.

My vision adjusted to the low light, and I saw him standing there—Caleb. His expression was one of confusion and mild concern, as if I’d simply woken up from a bad dream.

“Babe, are you okay? You looked terrified.”

His voice. That voice I used to run to for comfort now made my skin crawl. After everything I had been through—after the night I begged him to help me, sobbing through the phone—and he dismissed me as if I were acting dramatic… How dare he show up now, pretending like nothing had happened?

“What are you doing here?” I asked, my voice cold and raw, laced with disbelief.

He gave me a casual smile and held up a plastic bag. “I just got back. Thought I’d surprise you. Got a few things for you—souvenirs and stuff.”

I turned my back on him without a word, bile rising in my throat. His presence alone felt like poison.

His tone changed, sharp and defensive. “What the heck is your problem? Are you seriously still mad I missed your graduation? You’re being ridiculous.”

I clenched the blanket so hard my knuckles turned white.

“This is about Bianca again, isn’t it?” he added with a huff, already rolling his eyes.

I said nothing, trying to hold myself together.

He winced and ran a hand through his hair. “Rhea, for God’s sake. She’s a client. A business contact. Why are you always so insecure?”

That was it.

I turned to him slowly, my voice trembling with fury. “You think this is about jealousy? About graduation?”

He opened his mouth, but I didn’t let him speak.

“They tied me up, Caleb. They beat me until I couldn’t scream anymore. They laughed while I cried and begged. And where were you?” My voice cracked. “I called you. I begged you.”

His expression flickered, maybe with guilt—maybe just annoyance. I couldn’t tell.

Before he could say anything, his phone buzzed.

He answered immediately. “Bianca?” he said, his voice softening, filled with concern.

Of course.

He listened for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, I’ll come now. Don’t worry. I’m on my way.”

He ended the call and turned to me with urgency.

“Bianca’s in the hospital,” he said. “She needs me.”

I stared at him, stunned. “And I don’t?” I whispered, barely audible.

“She’s not well,” he said flatly. “You’re strong. You’ll be fine.”

I laughed bitterly, though it came out as a broken sound. “I was attacked. I’m bleeding on the inside, Caleb.”

“She’s like a sister,” he said, exasperated. “Why do you always twist everything? You say you love me—so act like it. Understand that sometimes other people need me too.”

That was the moment something inside me snapped.

“No,” I said, stepping away from him. “Loving you means breaking myself into pieces to make you whole. I’m done.”

I didn’t wait for his reply. I grabbed my phone, my hands still trembling, and stormed out. My feet carried me to the nearest bathroom. I slammed the door shut and collapsed onto the floor, pressing a towel to my face to muffle the sobs that burst from my chest. Tears streamed down my face, hot and endless, soaking the towel as I cried like something inside me had died.

Because maybe it had.

There were no words left to say to Caleb. No strength left to argue, to explain, to beg him to care.

Then my phone buzzed again.

It was my mom.

“Rhea?” she said gently, “I’ve made all the arrangements. Everything’s set. You’re going to Sydney, just like we talked about.”

I wiped at my tears, trying to breathe. “I don’t know if I can go through with it…”

Her voice was soothing but firm. “You have to, honey. You need a fresh start. And you won’t be alone. Jasper will be waiting for you. He’s going to help you settle in.”

“Jasper?” I asked, frowning slightly. The name tugged at a distant part of my memory.

“Your childhood friend. You used to build sandcastles together every summer, remember? He offered to help when I told him what happened. He’s a good man, Rhea. And he’ll look out for you.”

I hesitated. Leaving meant closing a chapter I wasn’t ready to let go of. Not entirely.

“Honey,” she added softly, “the authorities are investigating. We’re going to catch the men who did this to you. You’re not alone in this anymore. They’ll face justice. I promise you.”

Her words cracked something inside me—not from pain this time, but from resolve. I wasn’t just leaving to run away. I was choosing to survive. And more than that—I was choosing to heal.

“Thanks, Mom,” I whispered. “Really.”

As I ended the call, my gaze drifted to the window. Beyond it was the city where I had lost so much—my innocence, my trust, my future with Caleb. But now, I had the chance to start over. A chance to rebuild.

And somewhere deep in my soul, anger began to harden into something stronger—determination.

Caleb hadn’t just ignored me. He had minimized my pain, invalidated my trauma, and walked away when I needed him most. He had made me feel like nothing.

But I wasn’t nothing.

I wasn’t powerless.

I stood up, wiped the last of my tears, and walked out with a newfound clarity. My suitcase waited quietly in the corner. I began packing—deliberately, forcefully. Clothes, documents, pieces of a past I was finally ready to leave behind.

I was leaving in three days.

And when I left, I wouldn’t look back.

Not at Caleb.

Not at the pain.

Not at the shattered girl who once waited for a man who would never choose her.

This time, I was choosing me.

Chapter 3

My fingers trembled slightly as I closed the final zipper on my luggage. The police had contacted me earlier in the morning—they had apprehended one of the men involved in my assault. The moment I heard the news, a knot formed in my stomach. The thought of facing it all over again—of confronting that night—made my skin crawl. But deep down, I knew I couldn’t run from it. Not anymore. I had to face the past, even if it meant reliving my worst nightmare. I couldn’t let fear define me any longer.

I was just about to walk out the front door when it flew open with a thud. Caleb stormed into the room, his expression stormy and volatile.

“Where are you going?” He barked, eyes narrowing on me.

I adjusted my bag on my shoulder, refusing to meet his gaze. I didn’t owe him an explanation—not after everything he’d done.

“Oh, I get it,” he sneered. “You’re off to meet your boyfriend, right? You’ve been sneaking around, haven’t you?”

His words made me stop in my tracks. I turned toward him, my brows furrowed. “What are you talking about, Caleb?”

With a twisted smirk, he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a thick set of photographs. He tossed them dramatically onto the floor between us, the glossy images fanning out in every direction.

I looked down—and froze.

There I was, sprawled on a bed, unclothed and unconscious. The photos were taken from angles that made my stomach lurch with disgust and horror. My breath caught in my throat as the realization hit me: they were from that night. The night I had been drugged and violated.

“Where did you get these?” I demanded, my voice trembling as my eyes remained locked on the images.

Caleb’s voice turned cruel. “Does it really matter? The truth is right in front of me—you betrayed me.”

I took a step back, the sheer weight of his accusation making my chest tighten. “Betrayed you?” I asked. “I didn’t betray anyone! I was assaulted, Caleb! I was drugged, deprived of my dignity, and tortured—don’t you get it?”

He shook his head stubbornly, his eyes cold and unyielding. “Save the lies. Bianca told me everything.”

I gave a bitter, disbelieving laugh. “Of course she did. Because whatever Bianca says must be gospel to you.”

“She’s not a liar,” he snapped. “She was devastated when she found out. She only told me because she thought I had a right to know the truth.”

The air around me felt suffocating. I was exhausted—mentally, emotionally, physically—from constantly defending myself, from being weighed down by his blind loyalty to the one woman who had manipulated everything.

“You know what, Caleb?” I said quietly but firmly, locking eyes with him. “I’m done justifying myself to someone who refuses to hear me.”

I turned to leave, my fingers tightening around the handle of my bag. But before I could take another step, Caleb’s hand shot out and grabbed my arm, his grip bruising.

“You’re not walking away from me,” he growled.

“Let go of me!” I cried out, yanking my arm, but his hold only tightened.

The next thing I knew, pain exploded across my cheek. His hand had struck me—hard. I stumbled backward, stunned. My face throbbed, my vision swimming with disbelief. He had hit me.

For a moment, the room was dead silent.

Then I slowly raised my head, my entire body trembling—not from fear this time, but from rage.

“I can’t believe you just did that,” I whispered, voice raw.

He stood there, chest heaving, eyes wild.

“This is it, Caleb,” I said, my voice rising with fury. “You want to believe Bianca? Fine. You want to think I’m the villain? Be my guest. But I’m done being your punching bag—literally and figuratively.”

Without thinking, I lifted my hand and slapped him across the face. The sharp crack echoed through the house.

“I’m leaving,” I declared, fire burning in my chest. “And there’s nothing you can do to stop me.”

As if summoned by our chaos, the door creaked open again. Bianca stepped in, looking every bit the part of a concerned, delicate flower.

“What’s happening?” she asked, voice laced with false innocence. “Is this about me?”

I glared at her, my patience obliterated.

“I didn’t mean to cause any trouble,” she continued softly, her voice trembling like she was about to cry. “I just couldn’t keep it in anymore. When I saw those pictures… I was broken. You’re like a brother to me, Caleb. I just wanted to protect you.”

I could barely contain the fury rising in me. My fists clenched at my sides, my nails digging into my palms.

“You liar,” I spat, stepping toward her. “You’ve been the one tearing us apart. You’ve been the one crawling into his bed behind my back.”

Her eyes widened, a flicker of real fear flashing through her carefully constructed facade.

“Don’t act like the victim now, Bianca,” I continued, my voice shaking with emotion. “You manipulated him. You fed him lies while playing the perfect little innocent. But I see through you now. And I’m done pretending.”

Chapter 4

Bianca burst into loud, dramatic sobs the moment my hand connected with her cheek. She clutched her face like I had committed some horrific crime, her cries echoing through the room.

Caleb immediately pushed past me and stepped protectively in front of her, glaring at me with fire in his eyes. Without warning, he shoved me backward, hard enough to make me stumble.

“What on earth is wrong with you?” he shouted. “She just got discharged from the hospital, and you think hitting her is okay?”

I steadied myself, rage burning in my veins as I stood tall again. “Of course,” I said bitterly, staring him down. “Of course you’re defending her—like always. That’s all you’ve ever done. You know what, Caleb? I’m done playing this game. If she’s what you want, go be with her. I’m finished with you. We're done.”

“No,” he said instantly, his voice shaking with disbelief. “You don’t get to leave me. You’re not walking away from this.”

I let out a laugh—sharp and humorless. “No, Caleb. You’re the one who can’t survive without me. And soon, you’ll understand exactly what that means.”

I turned toward the door, lifting my bag onto my shoulder, ready to leave it all behind.

But before I could step out, I heard his voice behind me—calm, casual, like this was just another day. “Relax, Bianca. She’ll come crawling back like she always does. She’s just throwing another tantrum.”

That cut deeper than anything he’d ever done.

For a second, I stood there in silence, the weight of his words pressing down on me like stones. I remembered all the times I’d gotten angry at him—hurt by his indifference, his gaslighting—only to end up apologizing, even when he was the one in the wrong. I always forgave him. Always found a way to excuse his behavior. Always hoped he’d change.

Once, I genuinely believed he loved me.

He used to do the little things—hold my hand when we crossed the street, text me good luck before every exam, show up with coffee when I’d pulled an all-nighter. There were moments that felt so perfect, like the surprise picnic he planned for my birthday or how he stayed up all night helping me cram for finals. Those were the memories I clung to when everything else started to fall apart.

But as time passed, things began to shift. He stopped listening when I spoke. When I cried, he called me dramatic. When I tried to explain why I was upset, he’d say, “You’re just too sensitive.” And somehow, I always ended up feeling guilty.

The love I thought we had became one-sided. He only cared when it was convenient—when he needed comfort, praise, or someone to stand beside him in public. When I needed support, he was always busy or indifferent.

I couldn’t pinpoint when it happened, but I stopped recognizing the version of myself that stayed with him.

Maybe it was fear. Maybe it was the hope that he’d go back to being the boy I fell for. Maybe I thought I didn’t deserve anything better.

But not anymore.

This time, I was leaving for good. No more explanations. No more apologies for loving too much. I was done.

Without glancing back, I walked out the door. A black luxury car was parked at the curb. My mother’s driver stood waiting and opened the door the moment he saw me. I got in wordlessly, my grip tightening around the handle of my suitcase as the car pulled away.

Every second, the distance between me and Caleb widened—not just physically, but emotionally too. And with each passing block, I felt a small part of myself begin to return.

When I arrived at the police station, two officers were already waiting for me. One of them offered a reassuring nod and led me to the interrogation room.

“We have him,” the officer said. “He confessed to being involved.”

My chest tightened. I stepped inside, my hands clammy as I faced the man who had haunted my nights.

He sat in a chair, chained at the wrist, wearing a smirk that faded the moment he saw me. I sat across from him, my heart pounding.

“Why did you do it?” I asked, my voice cold and controlled.

He leaned back and shrugged. “Wasn’t personal. I was paid.”

My breath caught. “Paid?” I echoed.

He nodded, nonchalant. “Yeah. Bianca Kingsley. She was the one who hired us. Said you needed to be taught a lesson. Said we should make sure you didn’t have anything left to hold onto—especially not the baby.”

I froze. The air left my lungs.

“Bianca?” I asked in disbelief, my voice barely audible.

He nodded again. “She wanted you gone. Claimed you were ruining her plans with your boyfriend. Told us to make you suffer, but not kill you—just break you enough that you wouldn’t come back.”

I sat there in stunned silence, every word he spoke driving a dagger deeper into my chest.

Bianca had been the one to orchestrate everything. Not just the manipulation, not just the betrayal—but the violence, the trauma. My body, my baby, my peace… all stolen because of her.

I stood up slowly, my fists clenched tightly.

“Make sure Caleb Grayson hears every word of this,” I said to the officers. “Send him the full report. I want him to see the truth he refused to believe.”

They nodded, assuring me they would deliver the information.

As I stepped outside into the night, the air hit my face like a wave of reality. The cold didn’t sting. I welcomed it.

Later that evening, I stood at the airport, watching the blinking lights of the departure board. My flight to Sydney was boarding soon. A strange calm settled over me.

Then my phone rang.

Caleb.

His name flashed on the screen, but I felt nothing—not anger, not sadness. Just finality.

I answered.

“Where are you?” he demanded, breathless and panicked. “Rhea, please. Let’s talk.”

I held the phone to my ear, my expression unmoving. “I’m going somewhere you’ll never find me,” I said quietly. “And this time, I won’t be coming back.”

Before he could reply, I ended the call and blocked his number.

The gate attendant called for boarding. I walked forward, heart steady, eyes clear.

I didn’t need closure. I didn’t need revenge. I just needed freedom.",1,1752604394.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

The Greek leaned back with a smile and said, “You know, we built the Parthenon, not to mention the Temple of Apollo.”  

The Irishman nodded, taking a sip of his coffee. “Impressive, no doubt, but it was us Irish who discovered the significance of the Summer and Winter Solstices.”

Not to be outdone, the Greek added, “And don’t forget, it was the Greeks who laid the foundations for advanced mathematics.”

“Fair enough,” the Irishman replied, “but the Irish were the ones who crafted the first timepieces.”

Sensing his moment to triumph, the Greek smiled knowingly. “Ah, but remember, it was the ancient Greeks who introduced the idea of sex as a pleasurable activity!”

Jerry Westman found it when he woke up that morning. 
It was early. Earlier than he usually cared to be up, as far as his work schedule was concerned. He’d worked the graveyard shift at the office for the third time that week and made it back to the house well past midnight. He planned to do the same thing that day. Mortgage payments were due, and overtime was a fickle mistress. He planned on doing many things that morning. Get the paper, make a pot of coffee, check his emails, wake up the kids. Any of these things were routine. 
He didn’t do any of it that day.
He woke up restless from the rough night’s sleep. Another dreamless and dark sleep, like normal. He had red creases on his skin from the ruffles on his secondhand sheets, and so did his wife. Helen slept like a rock as she normally did, and the kids wouldn’t even twitch until their bedroom light was flicked on. He rubbed away the eye crust and blinked several times. His sight always took a moment to adjust, and he wouldn’t truly see anything until he slipped on his glasses. 
He reached for the tarnished nightstand beside him and pawed around until his hands touched the chipped metal frames. He cracked his neck, sat on the side of his bed, and stared out blankly. The blue walls of his room were like a turbulent ocean in his glazed eyes. They were a sight he beheld often, and with the hum of the ceiling fan above, he could almost imagine the sea and cracking waves. But something was adrift in his waters. Instead of looking through his glasses at a blue plaster wall that morning, something was staring back at him. He put on his glasses and blinked.
	“Hel,” he said, shaking his wife’s shoulder. He did not look away from the wall. 
	“What is it, Jer?” she asked, her voice crackling to life like a thrift-store radio. 
	“Do you see that,” he said, still not looking at her. 
	“See what?” she said, writhing under the comforter and pulling at the sheets for warmth. “Have you woken the kids up yet?”
	“No,” he said. “Not yet. It’s Saturday isn’t it?”
	“It’s Monday, Jer,” Helen said into her pillow. “I’ll get them up. Would you please just make some coffee?”
	“Baby,” he said, trying to fix his sight. “Do you see this?”
	“See what?” Helen sprawled out on the bed and closed her eyes while Jerry was cleaning his glasses with his stained tank top. He put them back on and looked away, only briefly, to shake his wife’s arm. 
	“Baby?” he said as his wife wrapped around his arm. “Honey, please. Look at this.” He did his best to pull her off, much to her discontent. She finally sat up from the spring mattress and cracked her back. She ruffled her hair and yawned before wiping her eyes.
	“Jer, what is it?” she said, turning her husband’s way. “Can’t it wait? I need to get the boys to school and make the morning shift.”
	“Helen,” he said, his voice stern but airy, “do you see that?”
	“See what…”
	Then she saw it. 
	There, on Jerry’s side of the room, was a hole. It wasn’t large, it wasn’t small, but it was there. Perfect. Circular. Void. There was more to it than just being black. It was empty and full of shadows. It did not stare back at Helen, but Jerry couldn’t take his eyes off of it. His breathing was shallow as he tried to rope together a sentence. In the end, all he managed was, “Do you see it?”
	“Yeah,” Helen said as she tugged her pajamas back on her shoulders. “I see it… did you do that?”
	“Did I do what?”
	“That.” She pointed at the hole.
	“No,” Jerry said softly. “No I didn’t.”
	“You didn’t?” she said. “Then how’d it get there?”
	“I….” He blinked furiously and scratched his arm. “I don't know. Maybe the boys?”
	“Was it there when you got home last night?” Helen asked as she slid out of bed and walked over to her husband. 
	“No,” he said. “It wasn’t there when I got back. They would’ve had to have gotten up before us to do it.”
	“Yeah,” Helen said, stroking her blonde hair. “I’ll… I’ll ask them in the car. Here, I’ll go wake them up.”
	“Okay,” Jerry said, his eyes still locked on the hole. “Yeah. Sounds good.”
	“We were going to stop to get donuts on the way to school,” she said. “Is that okay?”
	“Yeah…” he said, pointing to their dresser on the other side of the room. “That’s fine. There’s a twenty in my wallet over there. Take it.”
 Jerry could feel her eyes on him, but he couldn’t bring himself to look at her. It felt like his senses were all going slack and pooling at his feet. Helen was concerned. He knew this. He was concerned too. Yet, no matter what rational thought came through his head, he could not look away from the hole. 
	“I’m gonna go get the kids up and get ready,” she said. “Okay baby?”
	Jerry swallowed as he said, “Oh… O-okay babe.” 
	She rubbed his shoulder in that same way she had for the past ten years of their life. Feeling it was normally second nature to Jerry. It was a common part of his day.
	Today was different.
	Today his whole body was numb. It wasn’t that he couldn’t feel anything, but that for some reason he didn’t care. He couldn’t really feel his wife’s touch if he tried. He couldn’t make himself. The worst part was, he didn’t truly know why. 
	“You good, love?” Helen said. Jerry jumped a bit and realized that his wife was still at his shoulder. He nodded and stumbled over his words for a response.
	“Y-yeah,” he said as he cracked his knuckles. “Yeah, I’m just… I’m worried we’ve got a termite problem or something.”
	“I know, honey,” Helen said, “but it’s okay if we do, we’ll just call the exterminator. It’s no big deal.”
	“We can’t afford an exterminator.”
	
	On instinct alone, she bent down, and kissed his crown. “It’ll be okay,” she said. “I promise.”
	“Okay,” Jerry said, unblinking.
	“We’re gonna be late,” she said with a glance to their old electric clock. “I’m gonna wake the boys. Then we’ll be out the door.”
	“Okay,” He said.
	“Will you be home for dinner?”
	“No… I’m sorry, I’ve got another graveyard shift at the office.”
	“Again?” Helen was changing into her uniform and pulling up her socks. “Okay, love...”
	“I’m sorry.”
	“There’s nothing to be sorry for, baby,” she said, slipping on her loafers. “I’ll save you left-overs, okay? I’ll make it something good.”
	“Thank you, Hel.”
	Helen went to kiss his mouth, but he didn’t turn. Her light lips touched his cheek, and what should’ve felt warm was cold. 
	“I love you,” she said. 
	“Love you too…”
	Jerry didn’t even flinch as his wife and kids slammed the front door closed. 

	He sat there for what felt like hours. The sun turned his closed curtains orange and blood red as the light glowed on his face. He didn’t feel their warmth as he stared at the hole. He only felt the weight of his chest growing leaden as the morning rolled on. 
	How long had he been there? What time was it? He wanted to look at the clock. He thought of doing it several times. However, each time it sprang to mind, it was sucked out of him. His arms would twitch and then lose purpose. His eyes would blink and grow heavy, but never shut. Everything he was or wanted to be was turning void. It was all a blur of dark blue and black. A vast and turbulent ocean sat at the edge of his vision, and it’s roar grew louder as his mind grew weary. 
	“I…” He struggled to move his jaw. “I need to get the kids from school…” He went to lift himself, but didn’t rise a centimeter from his seat. 
	“No,” he found his voice saying. “Hel can get the boys. I… I can stay.”
	“But why do I want to stay?” 
	The hole seemed to buzz as he spoke.
	“Well, Jer,” he told himself, his voice growing static, “We, ah, we got a problem.”
	“Problem?” he asked. “What problem?”
	He started to chuckle. It was dry like a desert breeze. His blue eyes started to roll in amusement and he ran his fingers through his hair.
	“What problem?” He started to dry heave, but didn’t look away from the hole. “Jer, com’on! Look at you!” His shoulders slumped as he stared at the wall. “You’re a mess. Your life’s a mess and everything you are is a mess.”
	“It is?”
	“Yes.” He nodded apologetically. “You’re a failure, Jerry. 35 with no direction, a job you hate, and a wife you hardly ever get to see. Hell, man. Do you even remember your own kids names?”
	“Of course I do.”
	“Oh?” he goaded, a yellow smile growing on his face. “Do you, now? Well then, Mr. Dad, what are they?”
Jerry stared at the hole in silence for a moment. A lump of laughter swelled in his chest, then died in a pathetic, “Ha.”
“I’m… I’m just tired,” he protested, “I know my boys!”
“Know your boys?” he asked again. “Jerry, Jerry, Jerry… You don’t even know yourself.”
“I do.”
“Nah,” he said, his voice going deep. “You don’t know yourself. You can’t.”
“I know myself enough to know that you’re not me!” He pointed at the hole, but his finger dropped as his mind began to flip.
“Oh buddy,” he cackled. “You’re just proving my point! This thing. Everything you’re hearing, it’s allllll you, baby!”
“No!” he yelled. “Its that- that… damned thing. It’s the hole, not me! What the hell is this? What is this?”
“Real life, Jerry,” he said. “C’mon, let’s take a break and just talk. Let’s talk about life!”
He managed to pull his head down and look away from the hole. He was tugging at his hair for dear life.  It was like a rat pulling a cat by the tail. He bared his teeth and seethed. A simple, “No.” fell out of his mouth, but it didn’t matter. Eventually, his hands grew weak and his grip loosened. His head floated upward and his eyes fell on the hole once more. It took his mouth again and grafted on a dead man’s smile. His lips curled as he cracked his neck and simply said:
“Lovely. Let’s begin.”
The hole inhaled and pulled on Jerry’s being. His muscles began to ache as he looked deep into its shadowy confines. The hole stopped being dull and soft ebony and was now shining like obsidian. That hole, that perfect hole, started zapping white light across its face. Soon the dark was turned into TV static. Grey. Black. White. It was like watching a million carrion flies congregate on the body of a dead man. It was there and it was deep. It was making pictures in Jerry’s mind that only he could see. His milky eyes went glassy as horror and confusion took root in his brain and blossomed on his face. He began to cry as the voice spoke again. 
“What do you see?” his voice said.
“Nothing,” He lied. “I see nothing!”
“Really?” his voice goaded. “Nothing? Cause I’m seeing a whole hallmark special without the pretty angles or Santa Claus coming to save you. I see you sitting in that cheap stained cubicle, editing the same document over and over again because it doesn’t look good enough. The boss was snippy with you wasn’t he?”
“My boss is….” He struggled to come up with a positive word. “My boss is fine.”
“Really? Even after he yelled at you in front of the whole office for using the last ream of paper? Even after he made you fix his damn coffee for the past seven years and yet somehow forgot your first name in that last meeting? Even when you kissed his rear and did exactly as you were told but still ended up with no christmas bonus? No promotion?  No raise after Seven years? After you did everything right, taking hours on a single document to check for typos just so he wouldn’t call you an idiot in front of the big-wigs.” His voice cracked as it wavered and found itself again. “Even after he made you work on your anniversary? Insulted your wife?”
“He…” Jerry pulled at his skin. “He insulted my wife…”
“He did, Jer,” said his voice, growing dark. “He insulted Helen. Right. To. Your. Face.” It inhaled like banshee preparing for a scream. However, no scream came. Only a question. 
“What did he call her, Jer?”
“He….” Jerry was shaking from fear and fury. “ He called her a…”
“A what, jer?”
“A bitch…” Jerry was flipping between sobbing and screaming. “He called her a bitch!”
“That’s right, Jer! He stood there, right in the middle of the office and called your wife a bitch in front of everyone! How’d that make you feel? Is your boss ,‘fine,’ now?”
“No!”
“That’s right….” His voice went soft. A smile cracked at the corners of his dry lips. The static of the hole was changing. Waivinering. It was like watching something swim beneath the surface of an ocean. It was deep. It was so deep, and it writhed under the static. His tears went cold as he found himself saying:
“You remember thoughts you thought as you sat in that stained, cluttered cubicle? You were there for hours and hours and hours and hours while Helen was sitting at home with a cold meal. She was waiting for you, and you didn’t get back in until past midnight! You were mad, weren’t you Jerry?”
“Yes…”  His fists clenched.
“Do you remember what you saw inside that messy little head of yours?”
He shook his head.
“Don’t lie.”
He was frozen. He wasn’t sure he was staring at anything. There was nothing in his sight but that hole. That devilish hole, staring back at him like the static eye of a demon, until, suddenly, the static fading to a pure glowing black. Horrid things played out on that screen that only  Jerry could see. He did, it made him weep in silence and fear. Not because the images scared him, but because he couldn’t feel remorse for what he saw.
“I- I don’t want to… I don’t wanna see that!”
“Why not?” he yelled at himself. “You see it in your head all the time. It’s everything you’ve thought up! That’s you! Isn’t it?”
“That’s not me,” he cried.
	“It is!” He began to wipe away the tears and laugh in madness. “It’s all you’ve ever been!”
	He stared at it longer and longer until his eyes were wide in awe. It was beautiful, he decided. It was so horribly beautiful. 
	And he laughed until his voice was hoarse, and the static faded to black. 

	He didn’t care what time it was. The light around him was unfocused and colorless. He no longer saw his dark ocean. Nor did he hear the hum of the ceiling fan above his head. He forgot what clothes he was wearing, how big his room was, and even his own age. How long had he been staring at that hole? Five minutes? An hour? A day? A week? It was becoming moot and null. 
	What he’d seen in that static- that glimpse of beauty which echoed in his mind- haunted him. He craved it like a drug. He wanted more, and hated how much he wanted it- how much he needed it. He hated how random it was. How cruel. How uncaring. Yet he still wanted more. 
	The hole knew this. 
	“Do you want to see it again?” it asked him. 
	He eagerly nodded his head. His lips trembled.
	“Then reach in,” it said. “Take it.”
	It took him a moment. His whole body was sore. He’d forgotten he had limbs. Slowly but surely, he started to stand. The touch of the carpet on his bare cold feet was foreign. It was like he could feel everything and nothing all at once. He was a toddler crawling to an open flame, and he knew this. 
	He didn’t care. 
	He reached an arm out and touched the hole. His hand sank into it like tar, and he felt a cold so deep it electrified him with laughter. It wasn’t the laughter of a man. It was hoarse, and raw. It was the croaking of a frog. It was the sound of madness. He saw in that moment, as his hand sunk into the pit,  all of that horror which he craved. He was enraptured by it. 
	Then he felt a pull. 
In a flash his entire arm was dragged into the dark. He struggled, trying to stay on his feet. He was trying to push away from the wall. He was trying to pry his body from that thing on his wall. Yet in the midst of it he stopped. 
 He fell to the ground and looked up at the ceiling. For the first time in what felt like eons, he heard the hum of his ocean. He felt the warm waters pooling at his back, and the red sky kissing his face with a warmth he hadn’t felt for ages. Then slowly he closed his eyes, and let the hum overtake him. 
He fell into it like a daydream. 
***
Helen Westman got the kids from school. Their eldest son, Tommy, used a friend’s phone to call her. 
Dad hadn’t picked them up. 
Helen’s heart sank. 
She’d wanted to stay longer. She wanted to know what that look was in his eyes, but the clock had yelled at her. Her own fear made her leave that room and go to wake the children. She didn’t put makeup on that morning, nor did she listen to music in the car. She saw the sight of her husband all day long, and it haunted her. He was there in the car. There at donuts. There at work. The one constant sight she’d forever have of her husband was him just sitting there on the bed; his eyes wide and staring at that hole.
When they arrived home, she found Jerry. The house was quiet, and nothing had been moved. No life had happened. Without thinking she went to their room and expected to find him in there. Sitting, staring, alone with the hole. She didn’t want that to be true, but she knew it was. 
She ran to their room and flew open the door to see him. Jerry was still in there, but now on the ground, laying in a sea of blood.
He was missing his left arm. His face was pale and his old white tank top was stained red-brown. The yellow light of day was shining through the window and glistened on the mess that stained their old shag carpet. His mouth was agape and dark. Empty and full of shadows. It took her a moment to realize she’d vomited next to her side of the bed. Her head was spinning. The sight was overcoming her. She tried to make herself stand up and move to him, but she was repulsed. The sight of his eyes was horrid. 
It was only when she looked up at her wall that she started screaming. Not because of her husband’s body, but because the wall was blank. It was smooth and dark blue as a turbulent ocean.
She called the police.
They came and took him away, but not before she saw those eyes. 
Jerry’s eyes- those eyes she’d known for years- were darker than before. They were vast and turbulent oceans. They made her laugh for reasons she did not know.
The police tried to calm her down. They tried to understand what hole she kept raving about. As far as they could see there was nothing in the walls or floors that even remotely resembled the thing she was describing. 
But Helen knew where it was, and she watched as they carried it away.
There once was a hole in the Westman house, and it was carried out in a body bag.

1m0pmux,https://www.reddit.com/r/fictionkin/comments/1m0pmux/grouping_up_my_kins_cause_y_not/,Grouping up my kins 'cause y not,"Hallo every1! On today's show we will be grouping my kins into either spiritual or psychological boxes bc I am bored and procrastinating making a new video to post on YT for my main channel. I will not and probably never will put my kins in like that 'highest, medium, lowest' tier thing 'cause when I'm shifting (happens honestly pretty randomly), whoever I'm shifted as immediately becomes my 'highest kin', I guess, and my other kins kinda just sit on the backburner lmao.

ANYWAYS on to the groups!

(Other)kin - Nixy (Germanic/Scandinavian folkore) - Spiritual(?) {I am pretty sure I lived a past life as a nixy, but I haven't had a shift in a while so it's beginning to feel distant, that connection, so I'll refrain from putting a serious label on it for now c:}

Theriotype - Fox-lynx hybrid (Darwin's Fox/Canadian Lynx. Fynx.) - Psychological {I actually originally thought it was a spiritual kintype, and while It does feel like my soul is the animal, it is mainly a mental thing. I don't think I lived as a fynx in a past life. And this could probably count as spiritual too but I don't feel like typing out all my words so I'll just put it under psychological and call it a day lmao}

Fictotypes - 

Glisten (Dandy's World) - Spiritual {I lived as him, am him, all that. I was and am fabulous.}

Mystic Flour Cookie (CRK) - Spiritual {She may have become more prominent as a kin due to my childhood, but all in all I believe I once lived as her. I suppose, eventually, even I returned to flour.}

Limey (BURNER) - Spiritual {Most definitely lived as this goober. As Doombringer and Limey Supreme. I am a villain, and as Limey, I shall take over the WORLD-}

Coffee (Animatic Battle) - Psychological {Currently a kinsider, but I'm placing him on this list anyways lolol. Plus most things I kinsider I only do so when I am certain there's a high chance they might be a kin. I don't think I lived as him, and I believe this aspect of my identity formed from my anger issues (Me? anger issues? naaah-). My anger issues also were derived from my childhood (can u tell im traumatized yet), and I feel Coffee's anger deeply as if it were my own, because I've been angry a lot. So I choose to identify as him because of how his mind and my mind feel nearly the same. Yeah he might be a kin. Uhh-}

Okay who liked my yap session? Who? I wanna know. Plz. I like talking D:(

I hope you enjoyed reading this, I'm gonna go be productive now and work on my dumb video, and I hope a cookie spawns and u get to eat it (unless ur a Cookie Run kin, then, uh, I hope some food u like spawns :3)

1m0plz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m0plz1/he_33m_asked_for_a_casual_connection_with_me_32f/,"He (33M) asked for a casual connection with me (32F) because he ""can't give it the time it deserves.""","Have you ever been in this situation, or something similar? What do you think 'casual' means from his perspective? Why do people get distant when something is really good? Should I have drawn the line at friends, or disconnected instead?

Story time!

A few weeks back I matched with this guy on Hinge, and since then he'd been consistently invested and encouraging to build a connection. We met fairly soon after connecting online, and had a great first date. A 1 hour chat over a cup of coffee turned into an additional 3 hour walk holding hands, then me reminding him of his time limit for the day and deciding to walk back. He walked me to my car, said he would like to see me next weekend over coffee or a drink, got my number, hugged, and immediately texted me as I was sitting down in my car. We exchanged mutual excitement over the date, and enthusiasm to meet again. From my perspective he has a lot of qualities I want and need in a partner, and we hit it off really really well. I'm certain he was feeling the same.

The twist is that we live 1.5 hours apart. On our date he asked me ""could you be with someone who lives in \[city/1.5 hrs away\]"" to which I replied with a flirtatious ""maybe"". I'm a pilot so my perception of distance is a bit different from the average person, and I'm willing to compromise on where I live for the right person. We discussed other compatibility topics which all generally seemed to work besides location. When discussing the next date, he offered to come back south to see me, to which I offered picking a central activity between us and he agreed. The day before our date he asked if he could cancel since family came into town, which he felt bad about. Family is important and I wouldn't want to interfere, so when I said we could cancel he immediately replied with rescheduling to come see me after work the next week. Again we finalized plans. This level of investment was validating to me, and showed me I was a priority for him, all things you hope to feel in the dating realm. Our dynamic and interactions felt balanced and in tune with each other.

A couple days go by and I get a new message from him saying, ""I had a lovely time meeting you, but I've been trying to figure out how to make the distance work with my weekly routine, and honestly, I'm realizing I can't give it the consistent time it would deserve. If you'd be open to a casual coffee or drink sometime when I'm passing through, I'd love that. But no pressure at all, and I totally get it if you're looking for something more available.""

I think he is a great person, with healthy boundaries, and a secure attachment style. My dating history is less than stellar so I feel like I have a good lens now for recognizing a safe person who can provide me what I need. TBH I may be a little more desperate to finding my person, and finding someone like him makes me hopeful there's actually people out there for me. With him it feels like it's over before it even started, and missing out on the opportunity for something great is disappointing. I took him up on the casual offer because if nothing else he's the kind of person I want in my social circle, but part of me also hopes over time we can get deeper and reprioritize a relationship if it feels right. For now it's back to the drawing board and filtering through the online profiles.",0,1752604038.0,dating_advice,8,0.5,False
1m0plmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1m0plmt/explore_best_electric_kettle_bodum_bistro_and_is/,Explore Best Electric Kettle Bodum Bistro and Is It Worth It,"Testing the Bodum 11451-01US electric kettle in my own kitchen has been an experience full of small surprises, both good and not-so-good. As someone who relies heavily on tea and coffee to function, I was curious how this little powerhouse would measure up. The design, efficiency, and safety features make it a compelling choice for someone in need of a compact kettle, but there were some quirks I noticed during my tests. 

**Sleek and Compact Design**  

The kettle has a minimalist yet functional look that seamlessly blends into my kitchen décor. Its black BPA-free plastic body and stainless-steel details give it a modern touch without going overboard. It’s small enough to fit into tighter spaces, like a dorm room or an RV, and that was a huge win for me since counter space in my apartment is a rare commodity. The water level indicator on the side, marked with cup measurements, is both easy to read and efficient if you’re just heating a precise amount of water. Though it’s compact, it feels sturdy in hand, and tipping or wobbling hasn’t been an issue at all. 

**Good Aspects**  

- Compact size perfect for smaller spaces  
- Modern design that fits most kitchen aesthetics  
- BPA-free plastic and stainless steel construction  
- Easy-to-read water level indicator for precision  
- Feels well-balanced and sturdy during use  

[Check Bodum 11451-01US price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b00851lrr6/)  

**Performance and Speed**  

Boiling water with this electric kettle is super quick and effective. With its 700W heating element, I consistently got boiling water in just about four minutes—a lifesaver during rushed mornings. Pouring the water feels natural due to how well the spout and handle are designed. There’s no unnecessary dripping or extra water splashing everywhere. Even with repeated use, the performance didn’t falter or slow down. I also appreciated the unexposed heating element at the base, which makes it feel like I can set the kettle on most surfaces without worry. 

**Safety Features That Make Sense**  

For clumsy people like yours truly, the steam sensor and automatic shutoff features are blessings. The kettle powers off on its own once the water reaches the boiling point, giving me peace of mind, especially given my habit of multitasking in the kitchen. The anti-boil dry tech is another layer of protection, ensuring the kettle doesn’t overheat when empty. This felt particularly reassuring for those chaotic mornings when I’ve left appliances running without realizing it. 

**Drawbacks**  

- Small capacity (17 ounces isn’t ideal for larger households)  
- No temperature control settings for specific beverages  
- Exterior plastic can feel slightly warm after prolonged use  

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**  

Operating this kettle is almost too simple. A manual on/off switch coupled with a power indicator light makes everything straightforward—no fancy touchscreen or menus to fiddle with. Cleaning isn’t bad either; it’s just a quick hand-wash situation, though I wish it came with a descaling reminder. Over time, with consistent use, hard water buildup is inevitable, so keeping an eye on it becomes a chore if, like me, you’re used to self-cleaning devices. 

**Areas for Improvement**  

- Lack of advanced customization like temperature controls  
- Smaller jug size makes it unsuitable for family-size needs  
- Noisy when heating water  

**Competing Products**  

While this kettle nails efficiency and portability, it does face some stiff competition. A friend recently got the Hamilton Beach 1.7L Electric Kettle, which offers a much larger capacity and a keep-warm function I’ve become slightly jealous of. On the other hand, the Cuisinart CPK-17 has far more customization options—seven temperature presets for various teas and coffees—but it does come at a higher price point. The Bodum model, however, beats both these options in terms of compactness and simplicity, especially for single-person households or small kitchens. What it lacks in advanced features, it makes up for with its sleek design and reliable performance. 

**Affordable Quality**  

For its size, features, and performance, the kettle strikes a fair balance between quality and cost. Its reliability for daily use without bells and whistles positions it as a budget-friendly option. However, if you need a larger capacity or additional features like temperature presets, you might want to spend a bit more on alternatives. Whether you’re a tea enthusiast, coffee drinker, or just someone looking to make instant soups quickly, this kettle lives up to its promises while fitting neatly into various budgets.

1m0pkie,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitSmokingJourney/comments/1m0pkie/what_i_would_do_differently_if_i_were_quitting/,What I would do differently if I were quitting smoking again,"When I was trying to quit smoking, I made a lot of mistakes that kept bringing me back to cigarettes. Like most smokers, I also made many mistakes whenever I tried to quit smoking, which caused me to keep going back. 

After smoking for 10 years, 60 cigarettes a day, I finally managed to quit on my 7th attempt. Now, five years since I quit, I believe quitting smoking is easy and that anyone can do it. You just need to know what to do and what not to do when you're quitting. 

The first mistake I made was always waiting for the “perfect moment” to quit. I would always say Not now, I’ll do it after my vacation.  I can’t do it know, I’m under stress, I’ll quit once it passes. Of course, the perfect moment never comes, because it doesn't exist. You will always have some problem, some obstacle, some excuse. Waiting for the perfect moment is just a lie we tell ourselves to justify not quitting. 

The reason behind this is fear. And that’s the second mistake. I was constantly afraid. I didn’t know how I would live without cigarettes. How will I drink my coffee? How will I go out with friends? How will I calm down when I’m stressed? It was all fear of the unknown and every smoker has it. Honestly, now when I look back, I can say that those were really stupid excuses. I enjoy coffee now more than before. When I go out with my friends, I have an even better time with them. And I’m not nervous as I used to be when I was a smoker. 

The third mistake I made is something almost every smoker makes, I believed that there was such a thing as “just one cigarette” or “just one puff.” I thought the addiction was over and that I could smoke just one cigarette and nothing would happen. Unfortunately, that’s not how it works. Every time I went back to cigarettes, I smoked even more than before. “Just one cigarette” or “just one puff” doesn’t exist; don’t fall into that trap.

And the fourth mistake was not asking for help from someone who had already successfully gone through everything I was going through, someone who knows how I feel, who knows what I need to do to quit.

That’s exactly why I created this community, and why I keep writing these posts and helping you quit smoking. I know what you’re going through, I know how you feel, what you fear and I know how to help you. 

That’s why I’m inviting 2 people to join my free 1-on-1 quit smoking program with me. The program is completely personal, just you and me, from start to finish.

1m0pkge,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m0pkge/the_hole_in_the_westman_house/,The Hole in the Westman House,"Jerry Westman found it when he woke up that morning. 
It was early. Earlier than he usually cared to be up, as far as his work schedule was concerned. He’d worked the graveyard shift at the office for the third time that week and made it back to the house well past midnight. He planned to do the same thing that day. Mortgage payments were due, and overtime was a fickle mistress. He planned on doing many things that morning. Get the paper, make a pot of coffee, check his emails, wake up the kids. Any of these things were routine. 
He didn’t do any of it that day.
He woke up restless from the rough night’s sleep. Another dreamless and dark sleep, like normal. He had red creases on his skin from the ruffles on his secondhand sheets, and so did his wife. Helen slept like a rock as she normally did, and the kids wouldn’t even twitch until their bedroom light was flicked on. He rubbed away the eye crust and blinked several times. His sight always took a moment to adjust, and he wouldn’t truly see anything until he slipped on his glasses. 
He reached for the tarnished nightstand beside him and pawed around until his hands touched the chipped metal frames. He cracked his neck, sat on the side of his bed, and stared out blankly. The blue walls of his room were like a turbulent ocean in his glazed eyes. They were a sight he beheld often, and with the hum of the ceiling fan above, he could almost imagine the sea and cracking waves. But something was adrift in his waters. Instead of looking through his glasses at a blue plaster wall that morning, something was staring back at him. He put on his glasses and blinked.
	“Hel,” he said, shaking his wife’s shoulder. He did not look away from the wall. 
	“What is it, Jer?” she asked, her voice crackling to life like a thrift-store radio. 
	“Do you see that,” he said, still not looking at her. 
	“See what?” she said, writhing under the comforter and pulling at the sheets for warmth. “Have you woken the kids up yet?”
	“No,” he said. “Not yet. It’s Saturday isn’t it?”
	“It’s Monday, Jer,” Helen said into her pillow. “I’ll get them up. Would you please just make some coffee?”
	“Baby,” he said, trying to fix his sight. “Do you see this?”
	“See what?” Helen sprawled out on the bed and closed her eyes while Jerry was cleaning his glasses with his stained tank top. He put them back on and looked away, only briefly, to shake his wife’s arm. 
	“Baby?” he said as his wife wrapped around his arm. “Honey, please. Look at this.” He did his best to pull her off, much to her discontent. She finally sat up from the spring mattress and cracked her back. She ruffled her hair and yawned before wiping her eyes.
	“Jer, what is it?” she said, turning her husband’s way. “Can’t it wait? I need to get the boys to school and make the morning shift.”
	“Helen,” he said, his voice stern but airy, “do you see that?”
	“See what…”
	Then she saw it. 
	There, on Jerry’s side of the room, was a hole. It wasn’t large, it wasn’t small, but it was there. Perfect. Circular. Void. There was more to it than just being black. It was empty and full of shadows. It did not stare back at Helen, but Jerry couldn’t take his eyes off of it. His breathing was shallow as he tried to rope together a sentence. In the end, all he managed was, “Do you see it?”
	“Yeah,” Helen said as she tugged her pajamas back on her shoulders. “I see it… did you do that?”
	“Did I do what?”
	“That.” She pointed at the hole.
	“No,” Jerry said softly. “No I didn’t.”
	“You didn’t?” she said. “Then how’d it get there?”
	“I….” He blinked furiously and scratched his arm. “I don't know. Maybe the boys?”
	“Was it there when you got home last night?” Helen asked as she slid out of bed and walked over to her husband. 
	“No,” he said. “It wasn’t there when I got back. They would’ve had to have gotten up before us to do it.”
	“Yeah,” Helen said, stroking her blonde hair. “I’ll… I’ll ask them in the car. Here, I’ll go wake them up.”
	“Okay,” Jerry said, his eyes still locked on the hole. “Yeah. Sounds good.”
	“We were going to stop to get donuts on the way to school,” she said. “Is that okay?”
	“Yeah…” he said, pointing to their dresser on the other side of the room. “That’s fine. There’s a twenty in my wallet over there. Take it.”
 Jerry could feel her eyes on him, but he couldn’t bring himself to look at her. It felt like his senses were all going slack and pooling at his feet. Helen was concerned. He knew this. He was concerned too. Yet, no matter what rational thought came through his head, he could not look away from the hole. 
	“I’m gonna go get the kids up and get ready,” she said. “Okay baby?”
	Jerry swallowed as he said, “Oh… O-okay babe.” 
	She rubbed his shoulder in that same way she had for the past ten years of their life. Feeling it was normally second nature to Jerry. It was a common part of his day.
	Today was different.
	Today his whole body was numb. It wasn’t that he couldn’t feel anything, but that for some reason he didn’t care. He couldn’t really feel his wife’s touch if he tried. He couldn’t make himself. The worst part was, he didn’t truly know why. 
	“You good, love?” Helen said. Jerry jumped a bit and realized that his wife was still at his shoulder. He nodded and stumbled over his words for a response.
	“Y-yeah,” he said as he cracked his knuckles. “Yeah, I’m just… I’m worried we’ve got a termite problem or something.”
	“I know, honey,” Helen said, “but it’s okay if we do, we’ll just call the exterminator. It’s no big deal.”
	“We can’t afford an exterminator.”
	
	On instinct alone, she bent down, and kissed his crown. “It’ll be okay,” she said. “I promise.”
	“Okay,” Jerry said, unblinking.
	“We’re gonna be late,” she said with a glance to their old electric clock. “I’m gonna wake the boys. Then we’ll be out the door.”
	“Okay,” He said.
	“Will you be home for dinner?”
	“No… I’m sorry, I’ve got another graveyard shift at the office.”
	“Again?” Helen was changing into her uniform and pulling up her socks. “Okay, love...”
	“I’m sorry.”
	“There’s nothing to be sorry for, baby,” she said, slipping on her loafers. “I’ll save you left-overs, okay? I’ll make it something good.”
	“Thank you, Hel.”
	Helen went to kiss his mouth, but he didn’t turn. Her light lips touched his cheek, and what should’ve felt warm was cold. 
	“I love you,” she said. 
	“Love you too…”
	Jerry didn’t even flinch as his wife and kids slammed the front door closed. 

	He sat there for what felt like hours. The sun turned his closed curtains orange and blood red as the light glowed on his face. He didn’t feel their warmth as he stared at the hole. He only felt the weight of his chest growing leaden as the morning rolled on. 
	How long had he been there? What time was it? He wanted to look at the clock. He thought of doing it several times. However, each time it sprang to mind, it was sucked out of him. His arms would twitch and then lose purpose. His eyes would blink and grow heavy, but never shut. Everything he was or wanted to be was turning void. It was all a blur of dark blue and black. A vast and turbulent ocean sat at the edge of his vision, and it’s roar grew louder as his mind grew weary. 
	“I…” He struggled to move his jaw. “I need to get the kids from school…” He went to lift himself, but didn’t rise a centimeter from his seat. 
	“No,” he found his voice saying. “Hel can get the boys. I… I can stay.”
	“But why do I want to stay?” 
	The hole seemed to buzz as he spoke.
	“Well, Jer,” he told himself, his voice growing static, “We, ah, we got a problem.”
	“Problem?” he asked. “What problem?”
	He started to chuckle. It was dry like a desert breeze. His blue eyes started to roll in amusement and he ran his fingers through his hair.
	“What problem?” He started to dry heave, but didn’t look away from the hole. “Jer, com’on! Look at you!” His shoulders slumped as he stared at the wall. “You’re a mess. Your life’s a mess and everything you are is a mess.”
	“It is?”
	“Yes.” He nodded apologetically. “You’re a failure, Jerry. 35 with no direction, a job you hate, and a wife you hardly ever get to see. Hell, man. Do you even remember your own kids names?”
	“Of course I do.”
	“Oh?” he goaded, a yellow smile growing on his face. “Do you, now? Well then, Mr. Dad, what are they?”
Jerry stared at the hole in silence for a moment. A lump of laughter swelled in his chest, then died in a pathetic, “Ha.”
“I’m… I’m just tired,” he protested, “I know my boys!”
“Know your boys?” he asked again. “Jerry, Jerry, Jerry… You don’t even know yourself.”
“I do.”
“Nah,” he said, his voice going deep. “You don’t know yourself. You can’t.”
“I know myself enough to know that you’re not me!” He pointed at the hole, but his finger dropped as his mind began to flip.
“Oh buddy,” he cackled. “You’re just proving my point! This thing. Everything you’re hearing, it’s allllll you, baby!”
“No!” he yelled. “Its that- that… damned thing. It’s the hole, not me! What the hell is this? What is this?”
“Real life, Jerry,” he said. “C’mon, let’s take a break and just talk. Let’s talk about life!”
He managed to pull his head down and look away from the hole. He was tugging at his hair for dear life.  It was like a rat pulling a cat by the tail. He bared his teeth and seethed. A simple, “No.” fell out of his mouth, but it didn’t matter. Eventually, his hands grew weak and his grip loosened. His head floated upward and his eyes fell on the hole once more. It took his mouth again and grafted on a dead man’s smile. His lips curled as he cracked his neck and simply said:
“Lovely. Let’s begin.”
The hole inhaled and pulled on Jerry’s being. His muscles began to ache as he looked deep into its shadowy confines. The hole stopped being dull and soft ebony and was now shining like obsidian. That hole, that perfect hole, started zapping white light across its face. Soon the dark was turned into TV static. Grey. Black. White. It was like watching a million carrion flies congregate on the body of a dead man. It was there and it was deep. It was making pictures in Jerry’s mind that only he could see. His milky eyes went glassy as horror and confusion took root in his brain and blossomed on his face. He began to cry as the voice spoke again. 
“What do you see?” his voice said.
“Nothing,” He lied. “I see nothing!”
“Really?” his voice goaded. “Nothing? Cause I’m seeing a whole hallmark special without the pretty angles or Santa Claus coming to save you. I see you sitting in that cheap stained cubicle, editing the same document over and over again because it doesn’t look good enough. The boss was snippy with you wasn’t he?”
“My boss is….” He struggled to come up with a positive word. “My boss is fine.”
“Really? Even after he yelled at you in front of the whole office for using the last ream of paper? Even after he made you fix his damn coffee for the past seven years and yet somehow forgot your first name in that last meeting? Even when you kissed his rear and did exactly as you were told but still ended up with no christmas bonus? No promotion?  No raise after Seven years? After you did everything right, taking hours on a single document to check for typos just so he wouldn’t call you an idiot in front of the big-wigs.” His voice cracked as it wavered and found itself again. “Even after he made you work on your anniversary? Insulted your wife?”
“He…” Jerry pulled at his skin. “He insulted my wife…”
“He did, Jer,” said his voice, growing dark. “He insulted Helen. Right. To. Your. Face.” It inhaled like banshee preparing for a scream. However, no scream came. Only a question. 
“What did he call her, Jer?”
“He….” Jerry was shaking from fear and fury. “ He called her a…”
“A what, jer?”
“A bitch…” Jerry was flipping between sobbing and screaming. “He called her a bitch!”
“That’s right, Jer! He stood there, right in the middle of the office and called your wife a bitch in front of everyone! How’d that make you feel? Is your boss ,‘fine,’ now?”
“No!”
“That’s right….” His voice went soft. A smile cracked at the corners of his dry lips. The static of the hole was changing. Waivinering. It was like watching something swim beneath the surface of an ocean. It was deep. It was so deep, and it writhed under the static. His tears went cold as he found himself saying:
“You remember thoughts you thought as you sat in that stained, cluttered cubicle? You were there for hours and hours and hours and hours while Helen was sitting at home with a cold meal. She was waiting for you, and you didn’t get back in until past midnight! You were mad, weren’t you Jerry?”
“Yes…”  His fists clenched.
“Do you remember what you saw inside that messy little head of yours?”
He shook his head.
“Don’t lie.”
He was frozen. He wasn’t sure he was staring at anything. There was nothing in his sight but that hole. That devilish hole, staring back at him like the static eye of a demon, until, suddenly, the static fading to a pure glowing black. Horrid things played out on that screen that only  Jerry could see. He did, it made him weep in silence and fear. Not because the images scared him, but because he couldn’t feel remorse for what he saw.
“I- I don’t want to… I don’t wanna see that!”
“Why not?” he yelled at himself. “You see it in your head all the time. It’s everything you’ve thought up! That’s you! Isn’t it?”
“That’s not me,” he cried.
	“It is!” He began to wipe away the tears and laugh in madness. “It’s all you’ve ever been!”
	He stared at it longer and longer until his eyes were wide in awe. It was beautiful, he decided. It was so horribly beautiful. 
	And he laughed until his voice was hoarse, and the static faded to black. 

	He didn’t care what time it was. The light around him was unfocused and colorless. He no longer saw his dark ocean. Nor did he hear the hum of the ceiling fan above his head. He forgot what clothes he was wearing, how big his room was, and even his own age. How long had he been staring at that hole? Five minutes? An hour? A day? A week? It was becoming moot and null. 
	What he’d seen in that static- that glimpse of beauty which echoed in his mind- haunted him. He craved it like a drug. He wanted more, and hated how much he wanted it- how much he needed it. He hated how random it was. How cruel. How uncaring. Yet he still wanted more. 
	The hole knew this. 
	“Do you want to see it again?” it asked him. 
	He eagerly nodded his head. His lips trembled.
	“Then reach in,” it said. “Take it.”
	It took him a moment. His whole body was sore. He’d forgotten he had limbs. Slowly but surely, he started to stand. The touch of the carpet on his bare cold feet was foreign. It was like he could feel everything and nothing all at once. He was a toddler crawling to an open flame, and he knew this. 
	He didn’t care. 
	He reached an arm out and touched the hole. His hand sank into it like tar, and he felt a cold so deep it electrified him with laughter. It wasn’t the laughter of a man. It was hoarse, and raw. It was the croaking of a frog. It was the sound of madness. He saw in that moment, as his hand sunk into the pit,  all of that horror which he craved. He was enraptured by it. 
	Then he felt a pull. 
In a flash his entire arm was dragged into the dark. He struggled, trying to stay on his feet. He was trying to push away from the wall. He was trying to pry his body from that thing on his wall. Yet in the midst of it he stopped. 
 He fell to the ground and looked up at the ceiling. For the first time in what felt like eons, he heard the hum of his ocean. He felt the warm waters pooling at his back, and the red sky kissing his face with a warmth he hadn’t felt for ages. Then slowly he closed his eyes, and let the hum overtake him. 
He fell into it like a daydream. 
***
Helen Westman got the kids from school. Their eldest son, Tommy, used a friend’s phone to call her. 
Dad hadn’t picked them up. 
Helen’s heart sank. 
She’d wanted to stay longer. She wanted to know what that look was in his eyes, but the clock had yelled at her. Her own fear made her leave that room and go to wake the children. She didn’t put makeup on that morning, nor did she listen to music in the car. She saw the sight of her husband all day long, and it haunted her. He was there in the car. There at donuts. There at work. The one constant sight she’d forever have of her husband was him just sitting there on the bed; his eyes wide and staring at that hole.
When they arrived home, she found Jerry. The house was quiet, and nothing had been moved. No life had happened. Without thinking she went to their room and expected to find him in there. Sitting, staring, alone with the hole. She didn’t want that to be true, but she knew it was. 
She ran to their room and flew open the door to see him. Jerry was still in there, but now on the ground, laying in a sea of blood.
He was missing his left arm. His face was pale and his old white tank top was stained red-brown. The yellow light of day was shining through the window and glistened on the mess that stained their old shag carpet. His mouth was agape and dark. Empty and full of shadows. It took her a moment to realize she’d vomited next to her side of the bed. Her head was spinning. The sight was overcoming her. She tried to make herself stand up and move to him, but she was repulsed. The sight of his eyes was horrid. 
It was only when she looked up at her wall that she started screaming. Not because of her husband’s body, but because the wall was blank. It was smooth and dark blue as a turbulent ocean.
She called the police.
They came and took him away, but not before she saw those eyes. 
Jerry’s eyes- those eyes she’d known for years- were darker than before. They were vast and turbulent oceans. They made her laugh for reasons she did not know.
The police tried to calm her down. They tried to understand what hole she kept raving about. As far as they could see there was nothing in the walls or floors that even remotely resembled the thing she was describing. 
But Helen knew where it was, and she watched as they carried it away.
There once was a hole in the Westman house, and it was carried out in a body bag.

I (36F) had been good friends with someone (34F) for a few years. We lived in the same city, worked at the same place, and got along really well. Neither of us is super social—we preferred a few close friendships over big groups, which made our bond feel pretty solid.

Things started changing after she got a new boyfriend. I never met him, but over time, her communication with me dropped significantly. At the same time, she completely cut off another friend from work. When I asked about that, she just said the other person “stopped reaching out,” which felt off because she had also been texting me much less.

She never said anything directly negative about her boyfriend, but based on what she did share—arguments about where to live—I assumed things were not ideal. So when she told me she was pregnant, I was genuinely surprised and asked if it was intentional, especially since she hadn’t shared that they were trying or planning anything. (In hindsight, maybe that was too blunt?)

A little while later, I found out—not from her—that she was planning a wedding. I was invited to the bachelorette party by another of her friends, which confused me since I didn’t even know she was engaged, let alone getting married. The group was very small—like 3–4 close friends and her sister—so I was shocked my name came up at all.

I didn’t feel comfortable attending something so personal when I hadn’t even heard about the wedding, so I declined the invite. I also messaged my friend directly and asked if she could clarify the situation, because it felt super awkward. She took four weeks to respond. When she finally did, she said she had told me about the wedding (I’m 100% sure she didn’t) and that she valued our friendship and was just “stressed and busy.” She’s currently pregnant and, as far as I know, not working.

I thought carefully and replied that I understood she’s going through a lot, but that I felt really dismissed by being left on read for a month—especially over something this personal—and I reiterated that I’m pretty sure she never told me about the wedding. I told her I still wished her all the best and that I’d be happy to meet for a coffee whenever she’s feeling less overwhelmed.

That was months ago, and I’ve never heard back.

So… AITA for feeling hurt and stepping back? I never confronted her harshly or made accusations, but it feels like I’ve been gradually phased out of her life and I’m not even sure why.",1,1752603911.0,AITAH,2,0.6,False

1m0pi1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1m0pi1e/the_breaking_point_of_love/,The Breaking Point of Love,"When Celeste Rodriguez arrived at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.

It was her birthday that day. Therefore, she received a bunch of birthday wishes from her colleagues and friends when she turned on her phone.

However, there was no message from her husband, Trevor Fleming, at all.

Celeste's smile faded.

By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.

Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper, was startled when she saw her. ""Oh, Mrs. Fleming… Why have you come here?""

""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked.

""Mr. Fleming hasn't returned yet, and Ms. Fleming is in her room, playing,"" Hannah replied.

Celeste handed her luggage to Hannah. When she went upstairs, she found Jordyn wearing a pair of pajamas and sitting at her table, fiddling with something. She was so focused that she didn't even notice anyone entering the room.

""Jo?"" Celeste called out.

Jordyn turned her head when she heard her. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""

Then, she turned back to her task.

Celeste walked over and pulled Jordyn into her arms. She had just given Jordyn a kiss on the cheek before the little one pushed her away.

""Mom, I'm busy right now.""

It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.

But upon seeing how focused Jordyn was, Celeste felt like she shouldn't disrupt her enthusiasm. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""

""Mm-hm!"" When Celeste asked about that, Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. This is the birthday gift Dad and I are preparing for her. We carefully polished these shells with tools. Aren't they pretty?""

Celeste's throat tightened. Before she could say anything, she heard Jordyn, with her back still turned, happily say, ""Dad even had a customized gift prepared for Wynn. Tomorrow—""

Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo… Do you remember it's my birthday today?""

""Huh? What?"" Jordyn glanced up at her, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands. She complained, ""Mom, don't talk to me. You're messing up the bead order—""

Celeste released her hold on Jordyn and said nothing more. She stood there for a long time, but Jordyn didn't look up at her even once. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without a word.

When Hannah saw her, she said, ""I just called Mr. Fleming. He said he has something to do tonight and told you to rest first.""

""I see."" Celeste acknowledged her words softly.

As she thought about what Jordyn had just said, she paused for a bit and called Trevor.

It took a long while before he answered, his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow—""

""Trevor, who's calling you so late?"" It was Wynn's voice.

Celeste tightened her grip on her phone.

""It's nothing important,"" Trevor responded to Wynn's question.

Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.

The two of them hadn't seen each other in two or three months, and she had finally made it to Andostan. Not only did he not rush home to see her, but he also didn't even have the patience to finish one phone call with her.

After so many years of marriage, he had always been like this—cold, distant, and impatient.

Celeste had gotten used to it.

In the past, she would have called him again. Then, she would patiently ask where he was and whether he could come home. Perhaps she was too tired tonight. So, she suddenly didn't feel like doing so.

The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.

There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.

She didn't come to Andostan just to see Jordyn and Trevor. She hoped their family of three could spend this special day together by having a meal.

This was her birthday wish for the year.

Yet, Trevor didn't answer her call.

A long time later, he sent a message: ""What's up?""

Celeste wrote: ""Do you have time at noon? Let's bring Jo along and have lunch together as a family.""

Trevor replied: ""Okay. Let me know the address when it's decided.""

Celeste texted back: ""Alright.""

After that, there was no further message from him. He hadn't remembered it was her birthday at all. Although Celeste was mentally prepared, she couldn't help feeling a pang of disappointment.

She was about to head downstairs after washing up when she overheard Jordyn and Hannah talking.

""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, Ms. Fleming?"" Hannah asked.

Jordyn said, ""Dad and I already promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes along, it'll be so awkward. And Mom is so mean. She's always unkind to Wynn—""

""Ms. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming is your mother. You shouldn't say such things. You'll hurt her feelings, you know?""

""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""

Hannah didn't know what to say to that.

Whatever she said afterward, Celeste couldn't hear it anymore.

She had raised Jordyn herself. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.

Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.

She hadn't expected this.

Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. She was unable to move for a long time. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.

Now, it seemed unnecessary.

She returned to her room. Then, she repacked the gifts she had brought from home and put them back into her suitcase.

Later, Hannah called to say she had taken Jordyn out to play and to contact her if anything came up.

Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.

Her arrival was nothing but a joke.

After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she wandered through this foreign yet familiar country.

By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.

Then, she suddenly received a message from Trevor that read: ""Something came up at noon. Lunch is canceled.""

Celeste stared at the message, unsurprised.

She was used to this. In Trevor's world, work, friends, and everything else were more important than her, his wife. Plans made with her were always canceled at his whim without consideration for her feelings.

Was she disappointed? Perhaps she would have been in the past. Now, she just felt numb and couldn't feel anything anymore.

Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.

Before she realized it, she had driven to a restaurant she and Trevor used to frequent. Just as she was about to go in, she saw Trevor, Wynn, and Jordyn sitting together inside.

Wynn sat close to Jordyn on the same side. She chatted with Trevor while interacting with Jordyn playfully. Jordyn, with her legs swinging around happily, played with Wynn and even leaned in to eat the pastries Wynn had taken a bite out of.

Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them. His gaze never left Wynn as if she were the only one he could see in his eyes.

So, this was what Trevor meant when he said that something had come up. This was the daughter she had carried in her body for ten months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.

Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned away and left.

Back at the villa, Celeste prepared a divorce agreement.

Trevor had been her teenage dream, but he had never truly seen or paid attention to her.

If not for that accidental night and the pressure from his grandfather, Arnold Fleming, Trevor wouldn't have married her.

In the past, she had naïvely believed that if she worked hard enough, he would eventually acknowledge and see her.

Unfortunately, the reality was harsh and dealt a cruel blow to her.

Almost seven years had passed, so it was time to wake up.

After placing the divorce agreement in an envelope and instructing Hannah to hand it to Trevor, Celeste dragged her suitcase to the car and said to the driver, ""To the airport.""

Chapter 2

At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.

Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.

But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.

Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.

Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""

""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.

In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.

In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.

""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""

Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""

""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.

Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""

""Yes.""

Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.

Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.

Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt—she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.

Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.

She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""

Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.

""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.

In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.

Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.

Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.

A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.

That night, Trevor didn't return home.

The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.

…

Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.

After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.

However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.

In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.

Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.

Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.

Now, there were over three million in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.

She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.

Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.

Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.

After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.

…

The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.

When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.

Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.

At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.

The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.

Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.

…

Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.

He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.

Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.

She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.

Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""

Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!

…

After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.

The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.

Chapter 3

Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.

He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.

Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.

To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.

Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.

At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.

On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her conception, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.

Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.

Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to—it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.

While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""

""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.

After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.

""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing—""

Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.

But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.

And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.

Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.

When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.

Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.

Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""

Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""

Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.

With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.

…

""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.

Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""

""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""

""No, not today.""

Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day—once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.

Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.

After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.

After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.

After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""

""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""

The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.

Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.

""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.

There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.

Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.

Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.

Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.

While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.

So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.

For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.

Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.

…

Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.

That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.

Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""

Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""

At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""

""When did you find out?""

""It's been a while.""

""Dad, you're so mean…"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""

Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""

Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""

""We're going back next week.""

Chapter 4

Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""

""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.

""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""

""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""

Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""

""Alright.""

""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""

After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.

After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.

But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.

At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.

After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.

As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.

But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.

This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.

It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.

Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.

When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.

Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.

Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""

Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""

When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.

After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""

Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.

Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.

After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.

The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.

On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.

""All set. Let's go.""

The car departed from the villa and headed to the airport.

…

Celeste had no idea that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. No one had told her.

Half a month had passed since she moved out of the villa. During that time, she had gradually grown used to and even fond of the peace and leisure of living alone.

It was the weekend, and she woke up late. After freshening up, she opened the curtains to a sunny day. She stretched lazily, watered her plants, and was about to make herself a simple breakfast when the doorbell rang.

It was her neighbor, Tilda Emery, who lived across from her.

""Ms. Rodriguez, I hope I'm not intruding,"" Tilda said apologetically.

Celeste replied warmly, ""Not at all, I was already up.""

""That's good,"" Tilda said enthusiastically. ""These buns and pastries are fresh out of the oven. I just made them this morning, and I brought some over for you to try.""

""Thank you. It's so kind of you to do this, Mrs. Golden,"" Celeste said.

""It's the least we could do. If it weren't for you saving Sylvia from that rabid dog the other day, who knows how badly hurt she might have been? My husband and I have been wanting to thank you properly for saving our girl, but work has kept us busy. We felt so bad about it.""

""It was nothing, Mrs. Golden. Don't mention it.""

After a few more pleasantries, Tilda left.

Back inside, Celeste ate breakfast while studying the algorithm of an AI she had been researching.

Later that day, a news notification about Trellis College's centennial celebration popped up on her phone. Celeste paused to check the date and realized that it was indeed Trellis College's 100th-year anniversary.

She browsed the news online and saw several trending hashtags about the event. The celebration was receiving high attention, not only because Trellis College was the top educational institute in the country but also because this was its first centennial celebration.

Many distinguished alumni had been invited back to the alma mater for the event. Those honorary alumni were highly regarded figures in various fields.

Celeste stared at the screen for a while. When she saw several familiar faces in the photos, her hand trembled slightly. Memories of her time at college flooded her mind. Her heart became unsettled.

If she hadn't gotten married right after graduating with her bachelor's degree, she might have been among those honored alumni invited back for this event.

Celeste closed her laptop and hesitated briefly before driving to Trellis College.

It was already late in the evening when she arrived. Many of the high-profile attendees had already left, but the campus was still bustling.

Celeste wandered aimlessly and eventually found herself near the familiar lab building.

A familiar voice called out to her. ""Cel?""

…

20 minutes later, at a cafe outside Trellis College, Matthias Yoder poured her a cup of coffee.

""How have you been lately?"" he asked.

Holding the cup, Celeste smiled faintly with her gaze lowered. ""I'm doing well. It's just that… I'm currently preparing for a divorce.""

Matthias hadn't expected such a response. He paused for a while before saying, ""I'm sorry to hear that.""

""It's alright.""

""What's next? Are you planning to return to the company?""

""I am, but…""

Matthias couldn't understand why she was hesitating. He said earnestly. ""Cel, the company needs you. You're a part of it, so I hope you'll come back to take charge.""

""But I… I…"" Celeste felt conflicted when she saw his serious expression.

It wasn't that she didn't want to return. The AI field had advanced rapidly, and she had been out of the industry for six years. Even if she went back now, she feared she wouldn't be able to keep up with the times, let alone lead the company and be at the forefront of the industry as she once had.

Chapter 5

Over the years, Matthias and Celeste had rarely seen each other. Yet, even from just a few encounters, Matthias could tell that she was no longer the confident and spirited person she had once been.

Matthias thought back to the Celeste he knew from the past. He could never have associated the word ""insecure"" with that individual. He didn't know much about Celeste's marriage to Trevor, but he was completely clueless about her sorry state which was essentially an open secret.

He had his suspicions but didn't voice them. Instead, he sincerely encouraged, ""Falling behind for a time doesn't matter. Your ability and talent surpass that of most geniuses. As long as you're still passionate about this field, it's never too late to start again.

""Don't forget that you were our teacher's favorite student throughout his entire career.""

Celeste smiled as she listened to him. ""If he heard that, he'd probably scoff and say that he didn't have much of a choice and could only settle on the least bad one.""

As she thought of her wise but sharp-tongued mentor, Celeste's smile faltered. ""I saw on the news earlier that he also came back for the celebration. How has he been?""

""He's doing well, though he's often annoyed by us—his ever-disappointing students—popping up in front of him from time to time,"" Matthias replied.

Celeste chuckled, her mind wandering back to the days when she toiled away working on thesis papers under her mentor every day.

""Come back, Cel,"" Matthias urged.

Celeste gripped her cup tightly. After taking a deep breath, she nodded and said, ""Alright.""

She had been passionate about artificial intelligence since she was a child, and she loved anything related to this field. But because of her love for Trevor, she had put her dream on hold for seven years.",1,1752603787.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

At the dinner table, I broke up with Mason Ryder.

""Is it because I didn’t wear the outfit you picked out for me?"" he asked with a helpless smile.

""Yes,"" I replied, my voice steady.

""You know how my job works.""

He sighed. ""How long is this going to take?""

We met when I was eighteen. From classmates to a couple, from the lows to the highs, he was certain that I would never let go.

But he didn’t know.

Breaking up was just the final step.

I had already quit my job, and I had picked my destination.

I was going to the farthest place from him, to fulfill the promise I made to myself when I was younger.

Including the promises he had made to me.

This time, I was really going to leave him.

...

""Just because I wore the outfit she gave me? All this over a damn outfit"" Mason’s voice was low, and the dim candlelight from the restaurant flickered against his face as he sighed softly.

""Jesus, Cece. Really?"" he asked, his tone tinged with a little sarcasm.

I nodded, my expression firm. ""Mason, we're done.""

He rubbed his forehead like I was giving him a migraine. After a moment, he finally looked up at me.

""What number breakup is this now?""

His voice dropped to that wounded-puppy tone he used in rom-com press tours. ""I haven't cheated. Haven't ignored you. Haven't done a single thing wrong.""

I accidentally bit my tongue, wincing in pain.

He paused.

Reaching for his napkin, he looked away, slumping back into his chair. After a deep breath, he turned back to me, his expression serious.

""I remember you brought this up just two weeks ago,"" he said, his voice low.

""I’ve been working a lot. Cecilia, all the endless shooting made me exhausted, so stop playing games,"" he added.

I took a moment to compose myself before replying, ""I’m not playing games.""

He scoffed. ""Fine. But don’t regret it.""

""Thanks for the meal. I'm leaving."" I stood up, the chair scraping lightly against the floor.

Just as I turned, I saw Suzanne peeking around the door.

She didn’t even bother to knock. When she saw me, she just gave a quick nod, acting as if it were nothing more than a professional obligation.

Until her eyes landed on Mason.

Her whole demeanor shifted—lips trembling, fingers twisting the hem of her blazer. ""Mason, Wendy just sent another script and I—I really need your opinion.... I’m not sure about it. Do you want to take a look at it?""

Mason barely glanced at her, his eyes immediately shifting to me.

If this had been before, I would have snapped back at her. What kind of script needs to take priority over an already scheduled dinner with his girlfriend?

But I was so tired.

I started to turn to leave, but Suzanne grabbed my arm.

""Ah, Cecilia, I’m sorry for interrupting,"" her doe eyes widened with manufactured guilt. ""I'm still new at this, and I’m still getting used to everything. Mason's been so patient teaching me... I didn’t mean to be in the way. I’ll get out now. Please don’t be mad at Mason. He’s probably exhausted with all the shooting today…""

I couldn’t hold it in any longer.

""New? "" My laugh was razor-sharp. “New enough to interupt the dinner scheduled three days ago? Was I forcing him to eat with me, or was I forcing the director to schedule more scenes today?""

""Oh, so you have just started as his assistant? Just started, huh? So you couldn’t make it to the hospital when you were sick at 1 AM, instead of dialing 911 you just kept calling him? You didn’t know his personal schedule has nothing to do with you? And you still magically appear at every one of our dates? Are you short on friends, or is this job not enough to keep you busy? Or are you just taking advantage of the networking of our school? After all, you only got this job through connections.""

Suzanne opened her mouth, as though she were about to defend herself, but the words never came. Her eyes were glistening with unshed tears-those perfect, on-cue droplets..

The dim light couldn’t hide her flushed face, and as she turned to look at Mason, she lowered her head.

Mason was between us in an instant, shielding her. ""Cecilia , enough.""

He walked over to Suzanne, patted her back, and then shot me a frown.

""It’s just one dinner. She’ll get it next time.""

Next time…

I didn’t want another candlelit dinner with the three of us.

Suzanne’s tears might be silent, but her stifled sobs were all too clear.

It’s a pity she didn’t go into acting. Her skills were Oscar-worthy.

I suddenly found the whole situation amusing.

The cliché act, and yet Mason—who was a professional actor—was oblivious to it.

Maybe they deserved each other.

I shook my head and pushed open the door.

# Chapter 2 Resignation & Rebirth

When I handed my resignation letter to Wendy, she didn’t let me go immediately.

""Putting aside your personal history with Mason,” she said, tapping her Montblanc pen against the desk, “you're one of the best talent managers in this company. ""

""I know that half the agencies in Beverly Hills would kill to poach you. If it’s only because of Mason, I can arrange for you to work with a different group.""

I paused. So, after all these years, what I once considered passion had simply turned into a profession.

Wendy noticed my hesitation, pushing the resignation letter back to me. ""I won’t just let you go now. Take a month's sabbatical. Then let me know your decision.""

Once home, I collapsed into bed and slept deeply. By the time I woke up, it was already the following evening.

I was mindlessly scrolling through my phone when I came across Suzanne's Instagram story.

""My First Met Gala. Still learning how to pick the dresses and walk in heels, but thankfully, you helped me pick the best ones. My world was so tedious and was only filled up with my work. But now, I realize how stunning the view is when you are by my side. I hope I can always get to be the one on your side. #Blessed#Metgala.""

Attached was a photo of her in a silver Versace—with Mason's unmistakable silhouette reflected behind her, wearing the curated Tom Ford ensemble.

The picture had been taken with great care, the longing in the air undeniable. The black Tom Ford outfit Mason wore was the exact one I had picked out for Mason yesterday. The one mentioned in bitter at our break up dinne

The message that popped up next was almost too coincidental.

""I wore it. Satisfied now?""

The picture attached was of him taking a full-length mirror selfie.

It had been almost twenty-four hours, and he still thought it was just about whether or not he wore the outfit.

I scrolled through my phone, looking at the tasks I had managed for him over the years.

Every photoshoot was carefully adjusted until pixel-perfect, accompanied by every viral hashtag, and the posts were timed with uncanny precision.

For all these years, Mason Ryder's entire public persona was my magnum opus.

And yet he'd become a stranger in my own life.

My fingers hovered over the delete button. One tap erased seven years of contact lists, cloud backups, and carefully cultivated feeds.

The next day, I returned to the neighborhood where I grew up. My grandmother was startled when she saw me.

""You look like one of those fad-diet influencers! Didn’t you say you were making a lot of money? People who eat at the food bank look more healthy than you."" She pinched my waist, scowling. ""Where’s Mason? Why isn’t he here? Too busy getting pretty for TV to feed you? He sure looks well-fed on TV!""

I turned to see his latest drama playing on the television.

I couldn’t be bothered to explain that actors often look a bit fuller on screen. In reality, Mason was very thin, but there would always be someone looking after his meals. He didn’t need my sympathy.

I jumped into my grandmother’s arms. ""I’m starving. I really miss your homemade peach cobbler.""

After finishing the cobbler, I finally got to the point. ""I think I’m going to lose my job, Granny. Looks like I’ll have to live with you.""

She didn’t stop washing the dishes, her hands moving with practiced ease.

""I’d be more than happy if you stayed here. It’s you who can’t stand being here, right?” Her tone sharpened. ""Though I give it a week before you go running back to that pretty boy. Just like your like your mom—hopeless""

I hugged her frail, hunched figure from behind.

""Granny, not this time. I’m nothing like her."" I said seriously, ""Mason and I… I know which one’s more important. I’m planning to go away for a bit. Want to come with me?""

She froze for a moment, then twisted around to push me away.

""Go, go. Wipe your mouth first.""

She didn’t say anything more, but I could tell she was probably smiling.

At that moment, my phone’s smart door lock went off, showing a snapshot of Suzanne's face.

""What is it? Another emergency?"" Granny waved her hand nonchalantly. ""Go ahead, just let me know next time so I can buy some groceries… Ah, who am I kidding? You never know when that damn phone will—""

It suddenly hit me that, for the sake of work and Mason, I was always rushing in and out.

I took a few steps and then turned back.

Granny was still peeking around the kitchen door. When she saw me looking, she quickly turned away and pretended to clean up.

It dawned on me that someone who truly cares for you can never hide it, no matter how much they try.

# Chapter 3 Studio Showdown

When I returned to the studio, it was eerily quiet.

But I still called the police.

""Cecilia, I didn’t mean to,"" Suzanne's voice trembled as she explained. ""Mason asked me to get some backup files for you, and I—""

""You just broke in on your own?"" I cut her off, my tone sharp.

""I texted you, but you didn’t reply.""

""So, because I didn’t reply, you thought it was okay to just walk in? What if I hadn’t changed the password? Were you planning to redecorate while you were at it?"" I crossed my arms, watching Suzanne, who was on the verge of tears.

Something was missing., though.

Then the door to the mediation room swung open.

Ah. Mason hadn't arrived yet. No audience for her performance.

""Mason!"" Suzanne immediately stood up, rushing to explain herself. ""I didn’t mean to. I know Cecilia doesn’t like me, and I was worried she’d get upset, so I just took the liberty... I really just wanted to get the files, that’s all.""

Mason stormed in, still catching his breath..

This studio had originally been rented by Mason and me. Back when we were poor, we used to sleep on the floor there, surviving on nearly-expired canned goods.. Later, he bought a penthouses, and I had my own condo. But when it came to work, I still preferred being there.

This cramped space with its walls of scripts, fan letters, and framed memories was my sanctuary. It was a space that was wrapped in the comforting sense of “dedication.”

It meant something to me.

""What the hell is going on?"" Mason’s voice was reproachful, though his eyes were focused on me.

Suzanne bit her lip, holding back tears. Her face was red with humiliation.

""It’s all my fault,"" she muttered, voice breaking. ""It’s not Cecilia’s fault.""

One of the assistants, who had entered behind them, glanced at the scene and quickly tried to smooth things over with the cop. ""We all know each other. It was a misunderstanding between colleagues. Sorry for causing any trouble.""

But the cop ignored her and turned her gaze to me, waiting for my statement..

Mason seized the opportunity to pull me out of the room, his voice lowering as he spoke. ""It didn’t really cause any harm. You're mad at me? Fine. But dragging Suzie into this? Think about the TMZ headlines.""

""Did you give her the password?"" I shot back.

Mason paused, his expression stiffened. ""She asked me about it...""

""You told her to do this?""

""Look, she's my assistant. If she goes to get the files, it’s no big deal. You really want want to press charges?? How are you going to explain this to Wendy? If this hits the news, it’ll be your problem, not mine.""

It hit me—he still didn’t know I had planned to resign.

""Mason, do you really think you’re being fair here? Do you think I’m making things difficult for Suzanne because of you? You think this is about jealousy? She tried to break into my workspace, Mason, my safe space! And when I called the police, somehow, I’m in the wrong? You think she’s the only one who’s suffering?""

""I said it’s my fault,"" Suzanne sobbed from the doorframe, trying to get my attention. ""Cecilia, I’ll apologize however you want. I’ll make up for it, but can we settle this privately? Please, I’m begging you.""

Her pitiful look only made me angrier.

But before I could speak, Mason waved his hand dismissively. ""Enough. The studio's under my name anyway.""

The words landed like a slap.

He was right. When our studio lease was up, we decided to buy the place—only Mason’s name ended up on the paperwork.

I had just forgotten, taking the place for granted.

""Let’s go,"" Mason said, stepping in between Suzanne and me, pointing toward the car outside. ""The driver’s waiting.""

""I'd rather walk.,"" I muttered, avoiding his gaze. ""It’s too crowded. I don’t like it.""

I turned and walked out.

As I pushed through the precinct doors, whispers followed:

""Isn’t that the Mason Ryder? The one with a girlfriend he’s been dating for years? Who is she?""

""Must be the crying one inside. Other girl looks ready to murder someone.""

""Yeah, sounds about right.""

I didn’t even bother to look back. The whispers didn’t matter anymore.

# Chapter 4 The End of of a Decade

When I returned to the studio, I still felt a tightness in my chest. The studio walls felt like they were closing in on me.

I picked up my phone, , thumb hovering over contacts—only to realize there was no one to call. Years of chasing deadlines with Mason had left me with a glittering career and exactly zero real friends outside the industry.

In the end, apart from Mason and a few colleagues, I realized I didn’t have a single friend I could truly confide in.

So, what is the cost of growing up?

What does success really mean?

Suddenly, a message popped up: ""I'm getting married! You and Mason are definitely coming to the wedding!""

It was from a mutual friend of Mason and me from back in the day.

“Congratulations!”

“Soooo when are you and Mr. Movie Star tying the knot? Ten years is long enough!”

My fingers froze over the keyboard. I hesitated, then typed, ""We broke up.""

The moment I sent it, I realized how true it was.

In the past, when Mason and I fought or considered breaking up, we always kept it between us. We never wanted to burn bridges. There was always the hope of turning things around.

Like that time he invited me to watch an indie movie I had always wanted to see, and then dragged me to an empty street corner. He held my hand tightly, reminding me that he hadn't forgotten what I loved.

Or when he planned an entire week-long trip to Europe for just the two of us, making sure nothing, not even work, could get in the way.

As long as he wanted to fix things, I always forgave him.

The typing bubbles appeared. Disappeared. Reappeared.

""Don't believe me?""

The reply came almost instantly.

""It’s hard to believe, Cece, you two were so sweet.""

""Is there a scandal?""

""Don't believe tabloids!. Whatever TMZ says is all fake! They’re making stuff up all the time.""

I chuckled softly.

As if I didn't know how the gossip machine worked—I'd built Mason's entire PR strategy around controlling it.

The phone screen dimmed, but that comment—""You two were so sweet""—felt like a tiny thorn, pricking my fingertips.

It wasn’t fatal, but the dull ache persisted.

Yeah, we were once that sweet.

Sweet enough that anyone, including me, thought it would last forever.

I still remember that bone-chilling winter when I was eighteen.

I had on a thick down jacket, stomping my feet in cheap boots to release a puff of steam from my breath.

Beside me stood a thin guy in a light jacket, his lips pale, his fingers red from the cold. But he was still repeating his lines under his breath, his eyes shining with focus.

“Hey, do you want some hot coffee?”

I offered him my coffee, just because I couldn’t stand to watch him shiver.

He paused for a second before taking the cup, his cold fingers brushing against my hand.

""Thank you,"" he said, his voice clear but carrying an almost imperceptible hint of nervousness.

That was Mason.

And perhaps that was where it all began—at that moment when I handed him a cup of hot coffee, his cold fingers brushing against mine.

We ended up attending the same college, the same theater program.

He was a natural talent, the ""born to be actor"" everyone talked about, but his family wasn’t well off. They struggled.

As for me, I was more inclined toward the behind-the-scenes work.

Our first connection came in the rehearsal room, where the lights burned late into the night.

When his emotions weren’t quite there, I’d sit beside him, helping him with his character backstory, analyzing subtext, running lines with him.

He picked things up quickly, his intuition sharp.

Then, when he finally exploded onto the stage, drenched in sweat and glowing with energy, his eyes were so bright that they almost blinded me.

He ran offstage, and in the empty hallway, he threw his arms around me.

That hug, sweaty and pure, burned my skin.

Mason was like an uncut diamond back then.

He needed me—needed my eyes to see the character, my analysis to help him break through, and my presence as his first and most loyal audience.

He said, “Cecilia, if I ever become a successful actor, half of that credit is yours.”

And I just smiled to myself, quietly storing it in my heart.

I knew this was just the beginning.

Graduation was followed by unemployment—something most theater majors face.

Mason was no exception.

We rented a tiny apartment barely bigger than a closet with only a mattress on the floor. In the summer, it was suffocating, like a sauna, and in the winter, the cold seeped through the walls.

Like many with no connections, Mason took any role he could get: background extras, corpses in the CSI, characters with no lines, or someone who just had a single line—""Yes, sir!""—before being written off.

The frustration was overwhelming, drowning him over and over.

I, on the other hand, clumsily edited his resume, making his rare photos look a bit more polished. I scoured every film forum and casting group, like a hunter searching for even the smallest opportunity for him. After each rejection, I’d drag him to the riverbank, telling him, “Don’t worry, Your time's coming. I believe in you.”

We were inseparable, leaning on each other.

And eventually, his time did come indeed.

We moved out of that dreary little apartment and into the studio that would later hold so many of our memories.

But once the excitement wore off, our lives became even busier.

I became his shadow—his agent, personal assistant, image consultant, and sometimes, even his therapist.

I chose his scripts, helped analyze the characters, handled his social media, fielded media interviews, and when his emotions crashed, I was the only one he could turn to.

Eventually, Mason found success.

He was recognized by the mainstream, winning awards, and standing on that stage with the spotlight shining on his handsome face. He thanked the director, the crew, the fans, and then his gaze locked on me across the crowd, full of warmth and reliance.

He didn’t speak, but that look made my eyes fill with tears.

That moment, a massive wave of satisfaction and exhaustion hit me at once.

I felt like an artist who had exhausted every bit of energy, finally presenting the creation to the world. All the hard work was worth it.

But I never sought credit for Mason’s success.

Because I thought we were on the same page.

He filled my youth as much as I filled his, carrying both my efforts and my ambitions.

We were teammates, lovers, and family.

Which is why, when he tried to justify what he had done—unaware of his own biases—I saw it as a betrayal.

The phone screen flickered again.

It was a long voice message from that bride-to-be friend.

I pressed play, and her urgent voice echoed in the quiet room:

""Cece, I just texted Mason. He's acting totally normal? Are you sure this isn't some kind of misunderstanding?""

A pause.

""That new assistant Suzanne?""

""Oh, come on. That assistant girl's nothing! You built his career. Everyone knows that. We’ve all seen how good Mason has been to you! Is it really a misunderstanding? Don’t do anything rash…”

Misunderstanding?

Was it really a misunderstanding?

Perhaps this “misunderstanding” was the slow erosion of time. The gradual collapse after boundaries were tested over and over again.

Perhaps Mason, the man who once held me tightly in the dark, had simply grown too used to the spotlight—too comfortable with the presence of someone new who looked up to him.

Ten years—like a long film reel—spooled quickly in my mind.

A decade of sweet, difficult, and hard-fought memories scrolled past, and ultimately, they froze in the scene at the police station—Mason standing in front of Suzanne, frowning as he said, “This studio is under my name.”

I took a deep breath and typed on the screen.

""No misunderstanding. Ten years is a long time. Long enough to see a man for who he is… and who I'm not.""",1,1752603660.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

So for context, I'm not diagnosed but I'm like 90% I'm autistic. I've only ever been diagnosed with MDD and Generalized Anexity. I'm also transmasculine (they/them pronouns).

Anyways. As of late, i've gotten some feedback from my SM that my peers think i've been more ""spicy"" in their words.

She's asked me some questions about my transition as i've been on testosterone for some weeks now. We also talked about my diagnoses and the belief i'm undiagnosed autistic based on my behavior. Socially I am such a fuck up haha. She speculates that I may be less patient and/or easily agitated because of the shift in my hormones (which is likely for anyone who isn't aware about HRT). I personally have not noticed this difference. But I have noticed my coworkers have been very snappy with me. 

I've been letting things go... I don't hold stressful outbursts to my coworkers knowing the enviornment we work in. Like as soon as I clocked in, a coworker told me ""I don't really feel like dealing with your shit this morning"" and another has said, ""We should vote to take away OP's headset"" every day.

I've been getting this feeling like my coworkers may be more agitated by me as of late. Or possibly think i'm annoying. The thing is, banter among my coworkers is very common. We are all playful with one another and lightly tease. However I have a hard time knowing when it's too far. I ask for assurance from my coworkers when I eventually notice them become grouchy but they tell me it's fine and it isn't me... That is until they snap at me 
🫠 Usually telling me I talk too much, need to be quiet, etc etc. I make a lot of silly noises, I pitch my voice weirdly and ""fan girl"" whenever my coworkers are doing a good job or just... existing lol

Constant praise and complimenting. That sort of stuff. But then I get hit with, ""Leave me alone"" by one coworker out of nowhere... And it's just... making me feel bad because all week i've been feeling like everyone is frustrated with my personality??? I'll admit I haven't been feeling the best. I've been working 7 days in a row and after tomorrow being off, it's another 9. I'm scarily close to OT.

But I genuinely do my best to be happy for everybody. I make sure I don't take out my frustrations on my coworkers. Today I did snap though. A piping hot latte busted on me whenever I went to give it to the drive through at like 5:30AM. I yelled- not a word just a loud shriek of fear 😭 I stood there shaking, adrenaline and all. I had to collect myself but my coworker started talking to me. Telling me I need to work on my reactions and then... repeatedly just... talking to me. Telling me to walk it off, it's just coffee, etc. I kept telling her ""not now"" but she kept talking. So mid overstimulation I snapped, ""Stop talking.""

So I got in trouble for that. A light scolding. But I don't understand why I've been getting a lot of nips but when I let something slip, it's a huge deal?? Normally my coworkers would just talk to me if something is wrong... I thought...

I just don't know what to do around them right now. I was just told to be more mindful discussing my transition and essentially just don't talk about it at all unless it's in the back and i'm certain the partner is comfortable with it so i've been sobbing all day. I feel really icky. Which is completely understandable btw. I'm just not gonna talk about being trans from now on to save any problematic things arising. But it's hard feeling like my coworkers don't like me as much as they used to and/or are generally annoyed with my existence.

I feel like I can't just entirely shut up because I enjoy being around my coworkers and they were a safe place for me. As awful as this job is, the folks I work with make me feel like I shouldn't kill myself haha... But like... if I just don't interact with them, what's even the point ?? I stay at this job because I love them. I just... don't know how to read them... often... and everyone feels mad at me all the time. I'm just a button pusher... And it makes me feel bad i'm upsetting everybody by trying to uplift them but I don't... know how to interact with folks outside of the relationships that have been already established.",2,1752603655.0,starbucksbaristas,3,1.0,False

\*\*\*\*\*

Ava Thompson applies for an internship in the Knight Group of Companies, the best in Seattle, after her first year of post graduation.

What she didn't expect is to get a job as the CEO's Assistant. He makes an offer so irresistible that she can't refuse.

Luckier Knight AKA the devil of the business world. He is as ruthless as the word itself. He has a past. A very dangerous one at that. But his world turns upside down when he meets Ava for the first time. She is something he can't resist no matter how hard he tries.

# Chapter2

Ava's POV

""Emily.... get off of me. I have to get to this interview"" I groan as I once more try to push my best friend off of me. When she learnt I had applied for an internship at the Knight Group of Companies she practically jumped on me because she got offended that I didn't tell her when I applied in the first place.

""How could you do this to me ? How could you betray me like that, Ava ? I thought we were friends ?"" She fake sniffles.

""Well if you don't get off of me right now, Em, I am never gonna get there. I will talk to you, I promise just please don't make me late for this interview"" I beg.

""Okay""

As soon as she let me go I flew out the door to get a cab. After 5 minutes of searching for a cab I was finally about to give up and call Joey, my ex-boyfriend and a friend, to give me a ride. But as like a miracle a cab stopped in front of me and the window rolled down.

""Where to, miss ?"" The cab driver's gruffy voice called out.

""Knight Building"" I replied.

His eyes widened for a second but he got over it and motioned for me to get inside. I quickly got in not wanting to waste any time since my interview was at 9:00 and it was already 8:50. The people who work there, they are very punctual. The company pays amazing. But to get a job let alone an internship there is a little more than just difficult.

""Do you work there, miss ?"" He asked once we started driving.

""No. An interview for an internship""

""Well that company is really big. I hope you make it through""

""Thanks...""

""The name's Marvin, ma'am""

""Marvin""

""We're here""

I look down at my watch. 9:02. That's not too bad is it ? I hurry out after murmuring a 'thanks' to Marvin and leaving a big tip. I open the glass doors and hurry to the receptionist.

""Interview for the interns ?"" I ask.

She eyes me up and down for a minute then look in my eyes disgustingly.

""There are the elevators. 26 floor. Meet the receptionist there and he will guide you""

""Okay. Thanks""

I hurry towards the elevators when I heard her say something along the lines of 'stupid, desperate college girls'. But I was already inside and too late to care. I literally jumped in and pushed the button on the 26 floor and took a deep breath. I know I am late, but they wouldn't mind, right ? I mean there are gonna be several more people before me and it would take time to interview them all, right ?

I take some more deep breaths when the voice I hear stops all supply of air to my lungs.

""First day ?""

I thought I was all alone in this elevator. I never noticed him. I steadily look back. And there stood the most gorgeous and breathtaking creation of God and all mankind. He had a strong and well defined jaw. Broad shoulders, bulky arms that seem to be capable to lift anything. Well defined torso, you could literally see through his shirt eyes that seem to hold answers to all the questions of the world. I clear my throat when I realise I was checking him out in an elevator where he probably knew I was doing that.

""Umm..... no. I came here to apply for an internship"" I was surprised at how strong that came out to be.

""Aren't the interviews at 9:00 ? Your 5 minutes late now"" he says and steps towards me.

""I uh.... got caught up... in something"" or someone.

""What's your name ?"" Why am I answering his questions again ?

""Look I don't know you. Okay ? So let's just stop at that. I don't want to answer any questions"" I say and turn back around to avoid his proximity and his intense gaze that is burning holes in my brain right now. I feel a hand on my forearm and I am shoved to his chest. He grips harder and I stand on my tip toes to reach him but he is still an inch or two higher then me. I can feel his whole torso against my stomach.

I am not that innocent, a certain part of his anatomy is pressed directly at my core which results it in pooling inside my panties. I gasp.

""I said. What. Is. Your. Name ?"" He grits. Not wanting to anger him further I reply him.

""Ava.... Ava Thompson. Please let go. You're hurting me"" he immediately lets me go and his eyes wide with a little horror before he covers it up. The sound of the elevator tell me it's my turn to get off. I turn to go but before I do I step out and turn around. I never asked his name.

""What is your name ?"" I ask emphasizing on the your.

He smirks, ""Lucifer.... Lucifer Knight"" and then the elevator doors close leaving me a mess of emotions and confusion.

Oh hell. I just met the CEO of Knight Group of Companies and checked him out without any shame.

# Chapter3

Ava's POV

After my 'unexpected and unusual yet embarrassing as hell' encounter with the CEO, I went to the reception to ask for directions for the Interview room. He was a brunette 25 year-old blue eyed handsome boy who had the look of 'the guy next door'. He had well defined body but not as hot as Lucifer.

He was sexy as sin and really hot as the devil himself. The name he holds doesn't help the case at all. While he seemed to be the literal reincarnation of the devil, the guy here seemed like one of God's angels.

""I am here for the interview for the interns ?""

""Oh... your late. Anyways go down the left hallway count 3 doors on your right and go right in. There is a waiting area. Wait there till someone asks for you."" He says with a hint of smile.

""Oh... Okay.... uh... thanks.....""

""Gabriel""

Would you look at that. What an irony !

""Well thanks, Gabriel""

""Your welcome, miss.....""

""Ava""

""Ava""

""Yes""

""Nice name. Short and sweet. In Latin it means 'Living One'. Would you like to go out for a lunch or maybe dinner with me ?""

Did he just ask me out ? Well yeah he did. How can I say no when someone as hot as him asks me out. It's not everyday someone does that.

""As long as it's a date""

""It's a date. We will meet after your interview and discuss the details""

""Okay""

I just got a date with an Adonis. Yay ! I turn and I continue down the hall towards where he directed me earlier for my interview. I open the doors and I am greeted with a room full of people. Mostly ladies that applied for the internship. Most of them are wearing clothes shorter than normal work clothes and blouse so tight is acts as second skin and you can clearly see their bra. Wow. Slutty much ? I feel over-dressed. That is why the receptionist downstairs was giving me those judgy looks. Because I am getting those exact looks right about now.

""Miss Christina Rose ?"" A man in his mid-thirties announces rather bored after a moment of just glaring at the papers in his hand. Christina whoever she was got up with her files and left. The place where she was originally seated I took it and sat down with a magazine. If I was to make it through here, it was this or nothing.

After about 30 more minutes later the same guy comes out but this time rather... says my name.

""Miss Ava Thompson"" I got up and smiled at him to which he replied back with a genuine one.

I walked to the door and straightened the imaginary creases on my dress and knocked twice. ""Come in"" an old woman's voice replies form the other side. I step inside holding my straight posture as I take confident steps to the chair. There were three people conducting the interview. And each had a set of what I guess is a copy of each applying interns resume.

""Miss Thompson, tell us about yourself""

Believe it or not that's actually the most difficult question in the history of mankind.

""My name is Ava. Ava Thompson. I am 23 years old woman. I am a first year student at Seattle university, and I am an only child. I am studying on the software of computers....""

""Okay Miss Thompson. Why do you need this job and why KGOC ?""

Phew. Safe grounds.

""Well I need to be able to earn enough to pay my student loans and my next semester fees and well KGOC is the biggest in Seattle. They have ties in almost every field. And I think I can live upto the expectations and and manage my studies too. I am willing to give whatever it take to be here. It would be a great opportunity for me""

Lies. Lies. That's not what you feel passionate about.

The interview dragged in pretty good with some challenging questions here and there but nothing I wasn't prepared for. Then I was escorted to the reception by the same guy who called me in after he said that they'd call if I got the job. I met Gabriel there and he said that he was getting off for lunch. I didn't know I was in that long. We were going towards the elevators deciding on what we want to eat and where we want to eat when the elevators arrived. It was empty.

We both stepped in and pressed 1. He used to throw in some jokes here and there which occasionally made me laugh. The lift stopped at the 20th floor. From what I learned all the business meetings are held there. We were in the middle of a joke when the doors opened and in walked the man himself. My breath hitches and my smile slowly faded as we both locked eyes and his eyes sweeped over to where Gabriel was standing narrowing at him a little.

# Chapter4

Lunch date with two ?

Ava's POV

He stepped inside the elevator causing Gabriel to step towards me but before he was able to do that Lucifer changed his direction and stepped in between us instead causing both of us to step aside and away from each other.

""Good afternoon, Mr. Knight"" Gabriel's voice sounds from the other side.

""Good Afternoon, heading for lunch ?"" His icy voice asks him. Did I mention that his voice literally gives me goosebumps ?

I want him to talk dirty to me. I want to hear his voice when he whispers dirty things in my ear. What wouldn't I give to hear his grunts when he is.....

""Yes"" he replies. And I snap out of my thoughts. Sometimes I think my brain is wholly submerged gutter.

""And who is your friend ?"" He asks with a mixture is amusement and annoyed. He eyes me and smirks and I narrow my eyes visibly clenching my jaw. My nose flares and he raises an eyebrow.

""Her name is Ava"" Gabriel replies oblivious to our exchange since Lucifer blocks my view of him. I incline on my right a little to see Gabriel but Lucifer snidely steps forward again blocking my view of him. I huff in annoyance.

""Ava""

""Yes"" this time it's me who replies.

""And uh... where might I ask are you two going for lunch ?"" This time the question is directed at me. But I don't bother reply and turn away. After a moment of silence Gabriel replies with a low voice.

""We were just deciding on that, Mr. Knight.""

""I know a brilliant restaurant just around the corner. Shall I escort you two ?"" He asks which screams, 'you can't say no to me. I am coming either way'. What the fuck is this guy's problem ?

""Mr Knight....""

""Perfect. Its settled then. We will go together. I would like to know your new friend better"" he says and turns to me. I turn to the other side and act like he isn't standing there. I take out my phone and see that I received a text from Joey.

Hey baby, are you going to be at the seminar at 6:00 today in college ? If yes then i'll be picking you up, just text me the time.

Love,

Joey.

He knows I never miss a seminar. I love those. Those inspirational speeches, the people... Maybe Emily told him about my interview and he didn't expect me to be back before it. The seminar is at 6:00. I don't exactly have a car so I will have to ride with him. Emily hates these things and Joey does too. All he does during these things is make fun of all the words said by the lecturer. So I reply,

Well okay. Pick me up at 5:30. See you then, Joe.

Love,

Ava.

Okay so that's settled. Now to get through this stupid lunch. I look up to find both of them looking at me intently. Did I miss something ? What happened ? Did someone talk to me and I totally missed it due to my texting ?

""What ?"" I ask.

""Nothing"" they both reply at the same time. Fine. Let's get this done and over with.

We arrive at a French restaurant whose name I will spare you because I will completely butcher the language and feed it to the dogs if I even try to pronounce it. As soon as we enter we are immediately given a table. Courtesy of Mr. Knight. And we were attended immediately. A very young waiter possibly in his mid-twenties came to hand out our menus. He was pretty attractive. Not as much as Gabriel and Lucifer but he was definitely a looker.

I glanced down at the menu and sighed. I can't even read the menu properly. ""Have you decided what you want to eat yet ?"" Gabriel's voice breaks my series of self - pity.

I could just go with any salad and not embarrass myself. Or I could say my appetite vanished and just order a drink or a glass of wine. I could always go home and finish my lunch. Or I could just get up and run like hell. Decisions. Decisions. But I went with the truth.

""Honestly ? I can't even read the language."" I say.

A chuckle that literally melts my insides and brings shivers down my.... area, resonates on out table. Lucifer was laughing. On me. I should be angry but I am oddly left captured at his laugh and his beautiful ungodly features. How can someone be so beautiful ? He looked divine at that moment. When he regains himself he asks, ""Shall I order for you ?"".

I bite my lip and I almost miss the flicker of change in emotions in his eyes. ""Yes. I would be grateful"".

""Anything special ? Any cravings or allergies ? Something you don't like ?""

""Um.... well I love chicken but.... I don't exactly like seafood except fish. And I can go with lamb too.""

""Alright""

Okay. I turn to Gabriel who has been quiet the whole time. He is not looking at me but glaring at the table instead. Yes. Glaring. If he had laser eyes, he would've made a hole to the other end of earth. I place my hand on his and get his attention looking at him with questioning eyes. But he just shrugs in reply and plasters a smile on his face. It wasn't a fake one but it wasn't a real one either.

# Chapter5

Three's A Crowd.

Ava's POV.

I look at Gabriel concerned. What is it ? When Lucifer is done ordering he completely disregards Gabriel as he leans over to me. I can't help but feel bad for Gabriel. This was our date. And Lucifer Knight completely crushed it, stepped on it, broke it, and threw it out the window where it got more crushed by a bulldozer.

Okay. That's a little hyperactive imagination. But whatever. At least this way we will meet again for another date because there is no way am I letting him go without actually having a real date. At least then I would've tried. Right ? Right. Right ?

""So Ava... Tell us something about yourself"" Gabriel says emphasizing on the 'us'. His voice smug and a mysterious smile playing on his lips that says 'Game On'. I am not sure I like it.

Okay. That's two times today. I clear my throat. ""Um...."" But before I could reply he beats me to it. ""Yes please. Tell us. I would love to know more about you.""

""Well uh... My name is Ava Thompson. Child of David and Evelyn Thompson. I went to The Seattle High School. And I am a female. You know my Dad's X chromosome mixed with my Mom's X chromosome and viola. Here's me. Which ultimately means I have a vagina. Which I would not like to embarrass anymore. I came to KGOC today to give an interview for an internship. I am quite surprised I was only five minutes late because from what i know about my best-friend she wouldn't have let me out the door at all. Trust me, she is crazy to my crazy. There was this one time I was peeing she came inside my stall, breaking the lock saying she missed me very much and that I was taking too long. We were banned from that store after that. Well I kinda had it coming to me since I did kinda, sorta, accidentally burned down her entire underwear collection which was again retribution to her throwing away all my underwear and bras... She said they were all Neon. What is wrong with neon? I love neon colored underwear. I mean of course not the ones that glow in the dark... because why would you wear underwear in the dark at all? You can just be naked. What a liberation, let me tell you. I hate bras so much sometime I just feel like ugh.... tearing them apart. I never wear any bra or panties during night. Excpet if I am on my period... Oh sweet mother of god.... What did I just say?""

I realize but it was too late. The damage had already been done. I am officially the most awkward person ever. I react so weirdly and creepily to awkward situations that I turn tomato all the time. And I am pretty sure I could compete the Red Rush Shade of Lakme... Which is is really red. I mean so red to the point where.... that is not the point. I slowly peek up my eyelashes and dare a look at both males. And if it was possible, I make it even more awkward by adding, ""You both don't have vaginas. Probably X and Y chromosomes."" So yeah that happened.

Gabriel is the first one to break down. He erupts into laughter and is accompanied shortly after by Lucifer who is trying to laugh and still look like THE BIG BAD CEO. How do you do that? Gabriel if almost off the chair and i see around to notice we have captured the attention of half the restaurant. Who wouldn't? Lucifer gives up after sometime and laughs hard with Gabriel. I find myself drawn to Lucifer when I give myself time to take him in. His laughter is probably the best one I have ever heard. Better than my asthmatic Seal one. Definitely. After ten minutes when I come to my senses, mind you they laughed very hard for ten minutes, I try to gain their attention,"" Glad you both are happy at my expense"" I grumble.

The waiter comes and serves our food and gives me a very weird look and leaves. Well thanks buddy. You are not so attractive anymore. Both men look at me with huge smiles on their faces. Not the 'I am happy to see you smile' or the normal smile. No. Their smiles are the 'I just laughed so hard at you and am still controlling it' smile. Which let me tell you.... Gabriel looks so fucking delectable. And then I look at Lucifer who looks edible. I don't think he would mind if I take a scoop right?

Manitoba is the eighth providence/territory we've visited.

We planned our five-day visit around the Folk Festival, but we ended up liking the city far more than the festival and only attended it one day. Our favorite places ended up being Oh Doughnuts, Mr. Kim's, Into the Music, Biu Biu Zone, The Leaf, Fete Ice Cream, Johnston Terminal Antique Mall, and the Forks market restaurants.

We stayed at the Hampton Inn for its central location and it was a great choice for us. 24-7 lobby coffee and a large balcony to relax really made the stay nice. We giggled a lot about people complaining about the heat  on Thursday because we're from GA and it felt fine. (No, we could not handle your winters.) The smoke rolled in Friday, so my lungs are still hurting a bit and I'm sorry you guys are having to deal with that,

I don't think we had a bad meal the whole time (aside from the free hotel breakfast- those always suck.) I was surprised by the food quality, and wasn't expecting so much choice and ethic cuisine options. Even the folk fest got the food right with their vender choices! Yay for Winnipeg food!

As a people, y'all seem a bit reserved, but warm up quickly in conversation. We felt that people were generally very nice and curious about why we were visiting.

1m0pdh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m0pdh6/i_witnessed_the_strangest_apocalypse_nobody_ive/,I witnessed the strangest apocalypse. Nobody I’ve asked remembers.,"I saw the end of the world, and its harbinger, from the top of a mountain. It’s possible that nobody else had as good a view as I did, but even if I wanted to find out, I can’t. Nobody I’ve asked has corroborated my story. Most just laugh and go along with my excuse that I’m writing a horror book and want to interview random people about the area. A rare two or three have gotten a far-away look in their eyes before shaking their head and refusing to talk about it further.

That look both scares and comforts me. After a few dozen interviews with an equal amount of coffee and beer to help bribe a story from the interviewee, I’m noticing that thousand-yard stare more and more often. A part of me had hoped that I’d gone through the most vivid nightmare ever experienced. That hope gets smaller and smaller the more often I ask someone about the black skies, the red rain, and the yellow eyes.

The last person I interviewed went pale and nauseous after I asked if she remembered anything about that week. Before I could make sure she was okay, she ran off into a nearby park sobbing and telling me to stay the hell away from her. It might have been creepy behavior, especially for a girl that had just been interviewing her, but I sat at the coffee shop for hours until I saw her come out of the park and drive away in her car. Her makeup had smeared all over her face; her jeans and jacket covered in dirt and grass stains.

That was a week ago. It was the last time I doubted that the apocalypse I’d witnessed had happened. The interviews stopped, but that burning desire to learn either if or what anyone else has seen led me here. I want to tell my story and see who else has remembered. Hopefully I can jog your memory. I’ll pray that the memories aren’t as horrifying as mine or that woman who ran off into a park for hours.

I was- *am* a security guard for a mining company that owns the mountains near my apartment complex. Like most security guards, I signed onto the job for the amazing work-to-pay ratio. Half of my shift was doing patrols while listening to audiobooks, the other half keeping half an eye on security cameras posted around the mountain while I played video games. Every now and then I’d have to turn away hikers and check the radio towers near my station, which was what the security company was really paying me for.

The first rumble came during lunchtime. I was in my building, a concrete little thing I called my “hut”, looking at the security cameras and eating an egg salad sandwich when my cup of coffee started to vibrate every few seconds. Nothing to worry about. Earthquakes happen around the valley pretty often, sometimes as often as six in one month. The worrying started when the shaking grew more intense yet happened at the same rate. Put another way, earthquakes usually didn’t have a pace like footsteps. It’s what makes that one scene from that dinosaur movie so memorable.

The shaking got more intense. Thick binders containing company S.O.P.’s started bouncing off of shelves. Monitors were shaken from their stands and crashed to the ground. My coffee cup *bounced* off of the table and spilled onto the ground. I didn’t even notice. I had my head in my hands, curled up into a corner and praying that whatever was happening would just *stop.*

Something screamed. I wish I could say it had been myself, but there was a distant, screeching trumpeting that overpowered any shouting I could have done. A switch flipped in my head, and I needed to see what the hell was happening outside of my building.

My balance was hard to maintain but I managed to time it well with the shakes that were now shaking *everything* so much that a view of the entire planet splitting and shaking open was what I’d assumed would be outside of my hut’s window. But I had to see. If the world was about to end in a fiery explosion, I wanted to see it go. Better that than crying in a cement corner and getting concussions from my head knocking against the walls.

Fumbling, but somewhat stable, I made it to the window that overlooked the north side of the mountains.

Something was crossing the sky. It was higher than the highest clouds, at *least* for or five miles in the air but probably much taller than that. A black, writhing thing that stretched from horizon to horizon, caging the entire sky and casting a pitch-black eclipse in a wave across the valley. There were only a few moments to take the sight in before a pillar, a *leg* rather, crashed into the middle of the valley.

The impact threw me around the room like a ragdoll. After landing, I stayed there on the floor and waited. My ability to think was gone at this point. There was only a raw fear while the shaking continued. 

One more shake that was as powerful as the last. Then another weaker one. They’d started to subside, continuing off towards the south until the room was shaking just enough to make tiny waves in the pool of coffee on the floor next to me. I don’t remember how long I laid there on the floor, only that I got up after the coffee started soaking into my clothes. At one point I thought I heard a low thrumming as the emergency generator below the station kicked into gear.

My body was sore, and it hurt to move, but nothing was broken. Or at least, when I finally sat up and looked at what was left of my hut, broken bones weren’t stabbing any of my innards.

A part of my psyche realized I was technically  still at work and took over. As far as that part of my brain was aware, the room was a mess and my lead would kill me when she got there for her shift. One of the radios on the charging dock was still in its socket. I took it out and thumbed the “talk” button on the side.

“Hey, Maze?”

Maze was short for Maisey, my supervisor that had a trailer-turned-office at the bottom of the mountain.

No response.

“Maze? Maze!? Please respond, I… I need help.”

I let go of the talk button for a response. None came.

“Maze!? *Maze!?* Please tell me you’re there, all of the monitors are broken on the floor, I feel like my whole body is bruised, and all of the paperwork is soaking in a puddle of coffee. 

What do I do!?”

No answer but a slight echo from my shouting off of the concrete walls. I was really starting to notice the silence when a few pitter-patters came from the roof.

*At least it’s not raining,* I cursed as I walked to the window, radio still in hand.

“Maze, can you…”

The window was dark. Pitch black. A short time ago I could see an entire valley below a bright blue summer sky. I imagined, just for a second, that my hut had been sunken into the ground or somehow put into some void that I’d never escape from.

A roar came from behind me and *far* overhead. The sound crested my mountain, and with it a green light that flowed along the sky the same direction as the sound, north to south. I could see the valley for a few seconds as the dim light crept south, a portion of it funneling into what I’d seen crash into the middle of the valley. I referred to it as a leg before, and even now I think that’s the most accurate term for it. The thing had bent and pushed into the ground while I saw it.

Chills went down my arms when I saw, in the brief seconds the light went through it, just how big the leg was. Not width wise, but *length.* It made my head spin even trying to judge the size. Even at the time I was certain that it was connected to whatever was in the sky. 

After the light went into the leg and beyond the southern horizon, the valley started to light up too. Not much of it, though. Whatever that pillar was, it must have knocked out all of the electricity in the valley.

I listened, terrified, while the rainfall got heavier and small blue lights began popping on all over the valley. A lot of electronics can survive an electromagnetic pulse if their circuitry and parts are simple enough, including a lot of flashlights and even some cars, which I just assumed the lights were. 

It might sound odd to bring it up right now, but I want you to consider something I heard referred to as the “terminal freak out point”.

At what point when shit starts to go down do *you* start to panic? Everyone has one, even the most carefully planned and prepared apocalypse preppers you’ve heard about online.

It took three things happening in quick succession for me to reach my own terminal freak out point. The first was realizing that the red haze in front of the lights down in the valley was the rain itself. The rain was thick and red. Mist formed along the bottom of the valley that made any attempts at clearly watching what was happening close to impossible.

Second was the things that came out of the sky.

Even now, sitting here in a library at a public computer, people are giving me looks as my teeth chatter and my legs start to shake. But I’ll push through.

They didn’t *fall* out of the sky, per se, rather they hung from it. That black sky which was so far above our own was partially illuminated by a litany of yellow orbs that descended from whatever had swallowed the valley, maybe even the *world,* up in darkness. Whatever encompassed us, the yellow lights illuminated a billowing, black cloud that seemed to undulate at a fixed height in the sky.

The closer the bright yellow lights got to the ground, the more their light refracted into the rain and mist dropping into the valley. It would have been an unfathomable mercy if this hadn’t been the case, but it illuminated whatever *they* were. I still don’t know, but whenever I bring this up to people I interview, this is always the part where they get uncomfortable. Their subconscious must remember what the things looked like, as I do, and very clearly at that.

Heads.

Huge, black heads with glowing yellow eyes that shone like spotlights. Most were human; some were animals like cats, dogs, or horses. At a few points, when I was still in enough shock to keep staring at them, I saw the heads of insects with dozens and dozens of glowing eyes. They all descended and screamed. The screams didn’t have any sound to them, but the expressions of agony on each of the faces were quite clear. When they were done screaming, they ascended back into the sky to be replaced by another.

The valley was awash in yellow lights, red rain, and red mist. I still wasn’t at my terminal freakout point. Hanging off of the edge, sure, but I was struck stupid with fear and confusion at what I was seeing. I wasn’t pushed off the edge until I *did* start to hear screaming.

All at once, I heard an entire valley of people scream. I’m actually not sure if this is real or not. It’s a real possibility that it was a nightmare that I had while I holed up in my hut for the next week, but I think it was real. I pray to God, literally, that my mind doesn’t have the imagination to think of a sound like what I heard. Millions of wails of despair from a valley of people reaching the terminal freakout point. It formed a choir that I’m sure mimicked the deepest bowels of torment in Hell. I screamed too. Screamed until I tasted blood.

After that point, my memory gets a bit fuzzy.

What I do remember is pulling my window curtains shut and never looking out of them again. My concrete hut became my home, which I left only when I needed to go to the bathroom outside under an umbrella. It was horribly uncomfortable, but I made it work. 

There were emergency rations and snacks, enough for three days. I dragged it out for a week. After five days my stomach was making weird gurgling noises while pain racked my entire body, like my insides were tearing themselves up. There’s not a doubt in my mind that if I hadn’t had the emergency lights, a few paperbacks in my bag, and a few cases of water, I would have gladly thrown myself off of one of the mountain’s steep cliffs. I’m actually not sure if that’s the truth or not. I hope it is.

Besides my books, all my existence really was for a week was the countdown. That initial wave of green that went across the sky and into the pillar repeated itself. Every time it did, I heard screams come from the skies that made my ears ring even when I stuck my fingers in them. The intervals between each of the waves got shorter and shorter over time. At one point I was bored enough to do the math with a pencil and notebook, or at least the best math I could, to see when there wouldn’t be any more breaks between the waves of green light and screams.

A week. Whatever else was going to happen in this nightmare, it would be in a week. I waited. Besides dying, which was still more scary to me than what was going on outside, there was nothing else to do.

At the end, I was so delirious from the constant screaming in the air (mostly from the sky, occasionally from the valley), the hunger, and the time that was impossible to keep track of in my hut, that I crawled out into the rain to see the end for myself. Even thinking about walking made me nauseous.

The final vivid memory I have of the apocalypse started with me dragging myself to the edge of the concrete platform my hut was on and looking out to a destroyed and emaciated valley. There wasn’t much time to get a good look, not that I could have gotten one through the red mist, but I *did* see that there were still some lights bouncing around the buildings. A few of the skyscrapers in the downtown area across from my mountain were burned to a crisp, and I swear I could see a party of some kind going on the rooftop of the tallest one. An insane sight, but I can’t throw any stones; I was there to watch too. And I did watch. The waves of green light and screaming heads in the obsidian sky increased to such a frequency that I’m pretty sure I *felt* my ears give out to a painful whining sound.

The last thing I saw was another head descending from the sky. At that point the heads and the black, inky ceiling were a constant green that exaggerated the glowing eyes. I’m not completely sure, but I think that last head I saw was mine. We matched perfectly, both screaming in a mix of defiance and subservience at whatever was coming.



Then there’s a flash. In my memory, it’s yellow.



My screams were echoing off of my apartment walls. I was in bed, just as I had been the day it had all started. It took some time for me to calm down and remember what a healthy body felt like to move around in while I ate so much that I puked.

Despite what I said earlier, I admit that I’ve never thought it was a dream. I wouldn’t have tried interviewing anyone if that were true. I’d guess that deep down I still hold some hope that what I saw didn’t happen, even though I know it did.

While I’ve taken breaks from writing this for you, I’ve noticed fewer people out on the streets. I’m downtown now, and even during times of low traffic you used to be able to see at least a dozen people walking wherever - plus the constant flow of public transport.  There were still plenty of people going about their business when I first woke up, much to my shock.

On my way around the block to stretch my legs just now, I saw one person on the street. It was a woman in a business suit, a laptop case hanging from one of her hands. She was in the middle of the sidewalk, looking up at the sky. I think she looked scared.

I think people are starting to remember. That scares me almost as much as the apocalypse did because, being as objective as I can about what I experienced, my situation was somewhat of a best-case-scenario. I had a building with lights, books, food, and water all to myself. What could it have been like on the ground level, with millions of people in a compact area? What about the rest of the world?

I hope other people reading this also remember what happened. If you do, let me know. I get the feeling that we’re going to reach a second terminal freakout point when everybody else starts to remember.

My boyfriend helped, and we were told he’d be invited to the wedding as my plus one, thanks to him I got the money together way before the deadline but for some reason didn't send it straight to her, im so glad I waited cause I feel like this would have a very different ending. 
Before formal invites went out, I visited Amber and we went for coffee. She showed me a brochure of the venue which included prices like for the food which was around 35-40 per head (if i remember correctly). So a few hours after telling me about all the amazigness, she casually mentioned that she's having a ceremony for family and close friends, and then after she's having a party for everyone else. AND I AM NOT INVITED TO THE CEREMONY. Like the whole wedding thing? The walk down the isle? The vows? All the important stuff?? 
I was so shocked I couldn't even hide my reaction, my jaw litterally dropped and I just asked Why?! She said it was just too expensive but was excited for me to celebrate with her after and properly meet my boyfriend since they only briefly spoke over the phone.
I didn’t say much at the time, but it really bothered me. I talked to Charlie who was also the maid of honour, and she admitted it was odd but didn’t bring it up since I hadn’t. Other friends going to the Hen Do agreed it was strange. Word got back to Amber that I was hurt, and she messaged me to apologize Im paraphrasing but she said she “didn’t think.” I told her I was upset, but it’s her wedding and she can do what she wants. I also told her I wouldn’t be going to the Hen Do anymore.
She took it surprisingly well and doubled down about the money thing also saying i would understand since the travels would cost me a lot to come down for all the celebrations, she also added that she hoped we’d still be “besties” that pissed me OFF. I said to her that I’d been prepared to spend a good few hundred doing something I didn’t enjoy, just to support her and hang out with her. And she wasn’t willing to pay 40 to include me in the ceremony.
I told her that I didn’t think we were “besties” anymore, and that I felt hurt and excluded. I said I’d still be there for her in the future and happy to still come to the after party and celebrate her marriage, but this had changed how I saw our friendship. I made it clear that this is not an argument and will not be causing drama but I just wanted her to know how I felt. She never replied.
Cut to few weeks ago, the wedding happened, I never got an invite, lol. Everyone including the Bride looked great, the mutual friends who went to the Hen Do didn’t take sides but agreed her decisions were strange. Recently I heard that a few people in her circle said I “overreacted” and “ruined her day” by not attending. Her mum apparently said I backed out of the Hen Do last minute and wasted money, even though I pulled out months in advance and someone else immediately took my spot, which I also found weird how fast she found a replacement.
I would understand if she excluded my boyfriend since she didn't know him that well, but it felt a bit counter intuitive to invite me to the hen do but not the actual wedding. I don’t regret not going, not that I had a choice lmao, but also to the Hen do, I think it would’ve been awkward either way and it would have made me feel worse if I didn't say anything but after hearing that people were talking I do feel guilty, weddings are a big thing and I didnt want to ruin anything for her and im wondering whether I should have just bit the bullet, gone to the party and confronted her about it after.

AITA for telling her how I felt and taking a step back?

1m0pbiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1m0pbiy/cold_brew_confusion/,Cold brew confusion,"I recently ordered Monsoon Malabar from devans.in based on someone's recommendation after I told them I used BT french roast with a Moka Pot.

The beans took 2x as long to grind and after brewing it with the Moka Pot and tasting it, it was fine, but it just felt like this would taste really nice as a cold brew

So I made a cold brew batch, and turns out it tastes lovely, it's probably a cold brew blend?? Idk I'm not sure how this works...which brings me to my question 

1) is monsooned malabar a cold brew blend or do I just have a preference?

2) are there blends/ names/ roasts that are specifically meant for cold brew or is something like ""cold brew"" beans from BT the only specific beans you should buy for cold brew

I'm aware that theoretically you can brew and coffee using your preferred cold brew method and it becomes a 'cold brew', but I hope I'm able to explain my curiosity about which types of coffee/ blends would be more suitable for 'cold brew' ",4,1752603376.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

""Just like a real piano.""

I began to strum the opening chords to ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" my voice finding its strength as Emmy's small fingers danced over her makeshift instrument. Her eyes closed in concentration, lost in music only she could truly hear. Several morning joggers slowed their pace, drawn by the unusual sight of a little girl playing an imaginary piano with such conviction.

A woman in a tailored business suit paused, her gaze softening as she watched Emmy's performance. She dropped a five-dollar bill into our case before continuing on her way. Two children, probably on their way to private school judging by their uniforms, tugged at their nanny's sleeve.

""What's she playing?"" the younger one asked, pointing at Emmy's bottle caps.

Emmy looked up, her face brightening. ""It's a piano! I'm practicing so I can play for my daddy on a real one someday."" Her voice carried such certainty, such unwavering faith, that I had to swallow hard against the knot forming in my throat.

""We're saving up,"" I explained, forcing a smile as the nanny nodded sympathetically before shepherding the children away.

We played for three hours, our small audience changing as the morning progressed. By the time we packed up, the guitar case held a modest collection of bills and coins—another day, another step closer to Emmy's dream.

\* \* \*

That evening, our tiny Brooklyn apartment felt almost cozy in the warm glow of our single lamp. Emmy and I sat cross-legged on our threadbare couch, the coffee table before us covered with neat stacks of coins and carefully smoothed dollar bills.

""Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, one hundred,"" Emmy counted the quarters with painstaking precision, her tongue poking slightly from the corner of her mouth. ""One dollar!""

I recorded the amount in our piano notebook, where we'd been tracking every penny for the past two years. ""That's eighteen dollars and seventy-five cents today,"" I told her, updating our total. ""Which brings us to...""

""Two thousand and twelve dollars and forty-three cents!"" Emmy squealed, bouncing on the worn cushions. ""We did it, Mommy! We have enough for the down payment!""

I pulled her into my arms, her small body vibrating with excitement. ""We did it, baby. Tomorrow we can go look at that used Yamaha at Henderson's Music.""

""And then Daddy will hear me play for real,"" she whispered against my shoulder. ""Not just pretend.""

I closed my eyes, holding her tighter. Michael hadn't been home in three days—another business trip, he'd said. Another late night at the office. Another reason why he couldn't make it to Emmy's preschool performance. But tomorrow would be different. Tomorrow we'd finally have something to show for all our hard work.

\* \* \*

Henderson's Music Shop gleamed with polished wood and brass in the morning sunlight. Emmy clutched my hand as we entered, her eyes wide with wonder at the forest of pianos surrounding us.

""Good morning, ladies,"" Mr. Henderson greeted us warmly. ""Come to check on that upright?""

Emmy nodded so vigorously I feared her head might detach. ""We have the down payment!""

While Mr. Henderson showed Emmy the basic upright we'd been eyeing for months, I wandered toward the window, mentally calculating how many extra shifts I'd need to cover the monthly payments.

That's when I saw him.

Michael—my husband, Emmy's father, the man I believed was working overtime to help support our family—stood on the sidewalk across the street. He was impeccably dressed in a suit I'd never seen before, holding open the door of a gleaming black Mercedes for a stunning blonde woman and a little girl about Emmy's age.

I froze, confusion clouding my thoughts until they entered the building directly across from us—Steinway & Sons, the luxury piano gallery where instruments started at prices I couldn't even fathom.

Through the massive windows, I watched as Michael guided the woman and child toward a concert grand piano, his hand resting intimately on the small of the woman's back. The salesperson nodded deferentially, and Michael pulled out a checkbook I didn't recognize.

The world tilted beneath my feet as I watched my husband—my supposedly struggling, hardworking husband—sign what appeared to be a check for a piano worth more than our entire apartment building, while his daughter played on bottle caps across the street.

Behind me, Emmy's delighted laughter echoed through the shop as she pressed a real piano key for the first time in her life.",1,1752603371.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
