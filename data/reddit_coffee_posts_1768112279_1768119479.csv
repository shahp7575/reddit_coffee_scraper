Using the same coffee, same grind, same fill level, but the coffee comes out watery and flat with no crema at all.

Is there something different about the Venus or brewing on induction? Do I need to change heat, grind, or technique — or is this just how it is compared to the aluminum pots?",1,1768119201.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False
1q9twkc,https://i.redd.it/yzbk96x3iocg1.jpeg,First Bike Dilemma: Hunter 350 vs. Classic 350 (or something else?) for a WFH dev?,"Hey everyone,
​I’m a 22M software engineer working from home, and I’m finally looking to pull the trigger on my first bike. My usage will be about 70% evening chill rides through city traffic and 30% weekend morning runs (think twisty valley roads like Patratu in Ranchi).

​The Conflict:
​Me: I’m leaning towards the Hunter 350 (Dapper/Rebel). I love the agility, the 17-inch wheels, and the modern roadster vibe. It feels perfect for quick coffee runs.

​My Dad: He’s a ""Bullet"" purist. He wants me to get the Classic 350. He claims the Hunter feels ""too small"" and that the Classic is the only one that will keep me comfortable for 3-4 years without back issues.

​My concerns:
​Hunter’s Suspension: I’ve heard the rear is quite stiff. How does it hold up over time on slightly broken Tier-2 city roads?
​Classic’s Weight: Is the weight (195kg) a dealbreaker for a first-time owner in dense evening traffic?
​Alternatives: At this price point, should I be looking at the TVS Ronin or maybe stretching for the Speed 400?
​I’m 5’8” (if that helps with the ergonomics).
 Any advice from folks who transitioned from ""thinking about a Hunter"" to ""buying a Classic"" (or vice versa)?",3,1768119183.0,royalenfield,0,1.0,False

He works in finance and is really into budgeting and tracking expenses. At first I thought it was good that he's financially responsible.

About 3 months ago he asked to see my bank statements ""just to help me budget better."" I thought it was weird but he made it sound helpful so I showed him. He made a whole spreadsheet analyzing my spending and gave me a ""target budget"" for each category. Then he asked me to send him my receipts each week so he can ""make sure I'm staying on track."" Again, I thought maybe he's trying to help? So I started sending photos of receipts when I bought stuff.

Now he's demanding a full ""expense report"" every Sunday. He wants me to categorize everything, explain any purchases over $20, and justify things he thinks are unnecessary. Last week I bought a $35 shirt and he said that was ""irresponsible"" and I should have consulted him first. We don't live together. We don't share finances. This is MY money from MY job. When I said I don't want to do expense reports anymore he said ""if you have nothing to hide then why is this a problem?""

He's also started making comments when we're out like ""should you really be buying that coffee when you overspent on clothing?"" Its making me feel watched and judged constantly.

My best friend says this is controlling behavior and a red flag but Marcus says he's ""just trying to help me build good habits"" and I'm being defensive. Is this normal couples financial planning or is this weird?? I'm so confused right now and with our relationships..",0,1768119054.0,TwoHotTakes,5,0.33,False

Chapter 1

I opened my eyes, but could barely see. My head throbbed, and for a moment, I couldn’t remember where I was. As my vision cleared, I could see the dim cabin, bathed in a soft, bluish glow from recessed lighting along the curved ceiling and the edges of the seats.

The flight attendant crouched beside me, her uniform crisp and minimalist, streamlined, like everything else on this aircraft. Her dark eyes were steady but tinged with worry. The professional smile I imagined she’d practiced a thousand times was gone, replaced by a look of genuine concern.

""What… happened?"" My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper.

""You hit your head,"" she said softly. ""We hit some unexpected turbulence; it must have thrown you into the ceiling. Are you alright?"" Turbulence, I thought, the go-to explanation for everything from spilled coffee to near-death experiences.

I groaned, rolling onto my side. The low-pile carpet pressed against my cheek was soft yet sturdy. My ribs ached, sharp pain flaring as I tried to push myself up. My fingers brushed my temple, coming away damp with blood.

""Let me help,"" the flight attendant said, placing a steady hand under my arm. She guided me to my knees.

The sculpted leather pods around me loomed tall, their seamless, cocoon-like design blending privacy with function.

""Take your time,"" she urged as I tried to rise, my legs shaking beneath me.

I nodded, steadying myself on the seatback. The effort left me dizzy, my ribs protesting with every breath. I must have collided with one of the seat pods on my way down from my unscheduled trip to the ceiling. I finally lowered myself into my seat, letting the soft leather mold around my body.

""You should stay seated for the rest of the flight,"" she said, her tone polite but firm. Her gaze flicked to the blood on my temple again. ""Do you want me to—""

""I'm fine,"" I said quickly, my tone sharper than I intended. Regret bit at me immediately. ""Sorry. Just… rough landing."" Nice one, Zeke; snap at the person trying to help you.

Her brow furrowed slightly, then smoothed. ""Please keep your seatbelt fastened,"" she said, straightening and moving down the aisle. She came back a moment later with a warm, wet towel. ""For your head, sir. This should help."" “Thanks,” I muttered, holding the towel she handed me to my temple. “It’s my own fault really, as much time as I have spent around planes, I should have kept a hand on the overhead bins or something, might have softened the blow.”

She raised an eyebrow, curiosity flickering in her dark eyes. “You’ve worked in aviation?”

“Mechanic and some engineering,” I said, keeping it short. “I’ve probably spent more time fixing planes than flying on them.”

She offered a small, understanding smile. “Well, let’s hope you don’t have to fix this one.” She carried on through the cabin, attending to the other passengers.

My chest tightened as the vibrations beneath me deepened - a rhythmic pulse that clawed at my nerves.

This wasn’t turbulence. I’d flown enough to recognize the chaotic, fleeting jolts that came with rough air. This was different - steady and insistent, carrying a tension that settled deep in my gut.

I closed my eyes for a moment, trying to block it out, but the cabin felt wrong. Normally, the hum of the engines was a constant backdrop, blending seamlessly with the faint rush of air around the sleek fuselage. The designers had promised it would be quieter than any supersonic jet before it. Silent enough to erase the sonic boom from passenger memory and replace it with elegance.

But this wasn’t the serene quiet the designers had promised. This was something else entirely. That perfect, soothing hum had fractured into uneven, broken rhythms, off by fractions of a second, just enough to crawl under my skin. A low pulse resonated through the floor, subtle but relentless, as if the plane itself was trying to speak.

I opened my eyes, blinking against the dimly lit cabin. Above each pod floated holographic projections showing the passengers' chosen in-flight entertainment. The panoramic viewing panels stretched uninterrupted along the fuselage, seamlessly integrated into the jet’s ultramodern design. Beyond them, the faint curvature of the Earth was visible - a delicate arc that faded into the infinite black of space, a quiet reminder of the altitude we had reached.

Passengers shifted uneasily, the luxurious finishes and panoramic views doing little to mask the rippling tension. Faces lit by glowing displays flickered with unease, while others leaned toward the viewing panels, drawn to the faint line of the Earth’s edge. The jet’s elegance, designed to inspire calm, felt strained under the growing weight of anxiety spreading like static through the cabin.

The air was crisp and pure, filtered through advanced circulation systems that made it feel fresher than anything I’d experienced on the ground. The faint scent of new leather lingered, sharp and clean, mingling with the low hum of the jet’s systems - a sound that once felt soothing but now carried an edge, like it knew something we didn’t.

The rhythmic groan underfoot felt alive, resonating through the plane’s core as if it carried a message only I could hear. The noise clawed its way up my spine, pulling at a memory I didn’t want to relive, a sound I’d heard before.

A man three rows ahead leaned into the aisle. His mid-fifties frame was clean-cut, his tailored suit and polished cufflinks screaming corporate. He raised his hand sharply toward a flight attendant, his voice cutting through the low hum.

“What’s going on?” he demanded, his tone sharp enough to make a few heads turn. “We’ve been shaking for ten minutes. This isn’t normal.”

The attendant approached with measured calm. Her posture was perfect, her expression composed, but the tension in her eyes betrayed her unease.

“Just turbulence, sir,” she said, her voice smooth and polite. “Please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened. The captain is monitoring the situation.”

“Turbulence?” The man gestured toward the window with an incredulous huff. “I’ve flown enough to know this isn’t turbulence.”

“Sir, the captain has everything under control,” she said again, softening her tone as though that might ease his growing irritation.

The man sat back with a muttered complaint, his arms crossing over his chest as he glared out the viewing panel. His frustration was shared, quietly, in the nervous shifting of others.

Typical, I thought. He had that air of entitlement that seemed to waft off high-level executives, as if demanding answers would fix everything. Probably the kind of guy who snaps his fingers at waitstaff. Still, I couldn’t entirely blame him. He was right about one thing - this wasn’t normal.

Across the aisle from me, a woman sat stiffly upright, her hands gripping the armrests of her seat. She was in her mid-thirties, pale, with dark hair pulled back loosely. Her knuckles were white against the leather as she stared straight ahead, her chest rising and falling in shallow breaths.

The jet jolted again, and her head snapped toward me. “Do you think this is normal?” she asked, her voice trembling.

I hesitated. My fingers curled tightly around the armrest as I fought the urge to tell her the truth. “Just turbulence,” I said finally, the words sounding hollow even to my own ears. They felt like betrayal. Lying didn’t sit well, but what was I supposed to say? ‘Yes, something’s definitely wrong, and it’s probably as bad as you’re imagining.’ That’d calm her down, I’m sure.

She nodded quickly, though her grip didn’t loosen. Her eyes darted back to the aisle, searching for reassurance where none existed.

A low voice caught my attention, pulling me from my thoughts.

“You look familiar,” it said.

I turned slightly, catching sight of a man in his late twenties leaning forward in his seat. His elbows rested on his knees as he studied me with quiet curiosity. The hoodie and jeans were an odd contrast to the suits and polished exteriors surrounding us, like he’d stumbled onto the wrong flight and decided to stay. He looked more at home on a couch with a controller than here, staring at me like he was piecing together a puzzle.

I tensed but kept my voice even. “Do I?”

He tilted his head, his brow furrowing slightly. “Yeah, you’re… Zeke Morgan, right? The guy who - ”

“I get that a lot,” I interrupted, forcing a light tone.

The man blinked, his mouth opening as if to press further, but he thought better of it and leaned back into his seat. His curiosity lingered, though, in the glance he cast my way before turning his attention back to his display. At least he didn’t ask for an autograph or a picture.

I exhaled through my nose, gripping the armrest tighter. It wasn’t the first time someone thought they knew me. The worst part wasn’t the recognition; it was the assumptions they carried with it - like my name came prepackaged with scandal tied up with a neat little bow of judgment.

The rhythmic groan beneath my feet deepened, clawing its way through the cabin. It was sharper now, and more passengers were noticing. A child’s cry pierced the murmurs, the sound carrying over the rising tension.

I glanced toward the galley again. The flight attendants were huddled in the corner, their hushed tones doing little to hide the tension etched across their faces. One of them, a younger man with dark hair, gestured toward the cockpit, his movements sharp and clipped. The other attendants exchanged quick glances, their professionalism cracking just enough for me to see the fear they were trying to suppress.

I shouldn’t have been here. I hadn’t wanted to be here.

The call had come three days ago.

“She doesn’t have much time. If you want to see her, you need to come now.”

The voice on the other end of the line had been calm, measured, like they were delivering a weather report, not a gut punch. I didn’t respond. What was I supposed to say? That I wasn’t sure I cared enough to drop everything? That I wasn’t sure I could?

I’d stared at my phone afterward, the silence stretching until it felt like a weight pressing on my chest. Part of me wanted to ignore it, to shove it into the same mental drawer where I kept all the other things I didn’t want to deal with. But guilt doesn’t stay tucked away. It gnaws, insistent and relentless.

Of course, it had come to this. It always did. No matter how far I stayed away, she always managed to pull me back into her orbit. But if she really is dying... this might be my only chance to lay her to rest and with her, the ghosts that have haunted me for as long as I can remember.

I hadn’t booked the ticket right away. I told myself I needed time to think, to process. The truth was, I’d been stalling, hoping that time would make the decision for me. Hoping that if I waited long enough, I wouldn’t have to make it at all.

It didn’t.

When I finally accepted that there was no escaping it, there was no more time. Johannesburg wasn’t just half a world away; it was a place I’d spent years pretending didn’t exist. This flight wasn’t just my fastest option; it was my only one, now. Six hours to close a distance I’d sworn I’d never cross again.

I hadn’t called to check. I couldn’t. If it was too late, I wasn’t sure I could face it. And if it wasn’t… maybe part of me wanted it to be. That thought churned in my gut like old coffee - bitter and sour, leaving an aftertaste I couldn’t shake. I shoved it aside and focused on the confirmation email that glared at me from my screen.

I hadn’t even noticed it was the Altairis until then. A direct flight like this - just six hours to cross a journey that normally stretched over 15 should’ve screamed at me. But sometimes it’s easier to ignore the obvious. The irony didn’t creep up on me; it hit like a slap I should’ve seen coming. Of all the planes in the world, it had to be this one. The plane I’d helped build. The plane that had defined my career - and in one devastating moment, destroyed it.",1,1768118786.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

How do I have a conversation about Money.","I F 27 really like my boyfriend M 27. We've been dating for about a year and a half. The biggest problem I have is the amount of money I spend on him. 

He got me a really thoughtful Christmas gift, it was about 80 bucks. And I spent like $300 on him. I'm just using that as an example, but it's like every time we go to the grocery store he asked me to buy a chocolate bar. Or he'll have a bad day at work and ask me to buy lunch and ice cream. He will not do the same though. If I ask him to buy me a coffee he grumbles about money. He will only cover one meal a week or he'll complain but he refuses to eat at home, unless I do all the cooking. One time he gave me money to buy him groceries and he only gave me 50 bucks to feed the two of us for 5 days.

 It's really aggravating cuz I don't think he understands how much I spend on him. Like I recently just spent $80 to buy him a sweater because he didn't have anything for some foul weather that we were getting. Whether that's picking up groceries he doesn't have, or buying him work clothes. It makes me angry cuz he asked me to buy certain clothes for myself for him to enjoy. 

I'm like really pissed off because it's for his enjoyment and it's like a $200 dress. I am not going to buy it, I just flew across the world to meet his family. For his birthday in 2 months he asked for something that's going to cost me like $600. And I'll have some enjoyment from what he wants to do but it's so much money and he won't do the same for me. 

The other thing is he makes more money than I do.
He only wants to spend $400 a month on fun and date. to be honest it doesn't cover a lot, it cost $30 to go to his house on Transit. I appreciate how frugal he is but I don't think he understands the stress that it puts on me. I don't know how to talk to him about it. How do I talk about money?

We recently went away for the holidays and my 9 month olds sleep schedule obviously shifted a lot- since we came back she’s been having split nights, short and often naps in the day, waking up through the night etc. 
The last few days we’ve made massive progressive, she pretty much slept through the night from 6:30-5:00 (trying to slowly shift this to 7:00/7:30 - 6:00/6:30) 

ANYWAY, my in-laws cook lunch for the entire family a couple times a week, it’s always at 13:00, never earlier, never later 😂 the last couple of times I didn’t attend with my LO because she was earlier due to nap or napping. 

They’re getting very frustrated and ‘desperate to see her’. Im sure they think I’m deliberately keeping her away from them? They can’t seem to understand that her sleep schedule is important right now… ‘just bring her, she’ll be fine’ she won’t be fine, she’ll be crying because she wants to sleep and then be called ‘grumpy’ by them, but who is the one up all night trying to console my overtired baby? 
Ps. My LO will not sleep in busy surroundings/ in her pram (unless out walking) or even in my arms anymore, she’ll only truly settle when at home and in her cot. 

Sorry for the rant 😂😂
Ps. They’re more than welcome to come for morning coffee/ late afternoon walk as suggested many times, but they don’t seem interested in this.

1q9tmss,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1q9tmss/the_psychology_of_attraction_subtle_signs_youre/,The Psychology of Attraction: Subtle Signs You're WAY More Attractive Than You Think (Science-Based),"Okay real talk. I spent way too much time researching this because I was convinced I was mid at best. Turns out most of us are walking around thinking we're like a 4 when we're actually closer to a 7 or 8. The problem isn't our faces or bodies, it's our brains lying to us constantly.

Here's the thing nobody tells you about attractiveness. Your brain has this wild negativity bias where it literally highlights every flaw and ignores everything good. Evolution made us this way so we'd stay alert to threats, but now it just means you fixate on that one weird eyebrow hair while ignoring the fact that strangers keep making eye contact with you at coffee shops.

I pulled this from legit sources: evolutionary psychology research, body language studies, neuroscience podcasts, behavioral economics books. Not just random internet fluff. And honestly some of these signs hit different when you realize what they actually mean.

1. People remember random details about you

If coworkers or acquaintances bring up something small you mentioned weeks ago, that's a massive tell. Attractive people create what psychologists call ""attentional magnetism"" where others unconsciously pay more attention to them. Your brain naturally catalogs information about people it finds appealing. So when someone remembers you hate cilantro or that your dog is named Kevin, their subconscious was paying attention because you registered as attractive.

2. You get the ""double take"" or lingering eye contact

This one's straight from nonverbal communication research. When someone finds another person attractive, their gaze lingers 0.5 to 1 second longer than normal. You might catch people looking, then looking away quick, then glancing back. That's not creepy behavior necessarily, that's their brain doing a double check because attractive faces trigger dopamine responses. If this happens semi regularly at the gym, grocery store, wherever, your attractiveness level is higher than you think.

3. People act slightly nervous or overcompensate around you

Ever notice someone talking too much around you? Or getting weirdly formal? Or laughing extra hard at your mid jokes? Social psychologist Amy Cuddy's research shows people unconsciously adjust their behavior around attractive individuals. They're trying to impress you or afraid of looking dumb. If baristas seem flustered, if new acquaintances seem eager to please, if people apologize for nothing around you, congrats. You're hot and it's making them spiral a little.

4. You get complimented on ""personality"" traits weirdly often

Here's a sneaky one from the halo effect research. When people find you physically attractive, they attribute other positive qualities to you automatically. Intelligence, humor, kindness, all of it. So if people keep saying you're ""so funny"" or ""really smart"" when you're pretty average at those things, it might actually be because they think you're attractive and their brain is filling in the rest. It's not fair but it's how human perception works.

5. People mirror your body language constantly

Mirroring is an unconscious behavior we do around people we're attracted to or want to connect with. If you notice people copying your gestures, matching your energy, leaning in when you lean in, that's attraction showing up. This comes from neuroscience research on mirror neurons. We literally can't help but sync up with people we find appealing. Pay attention next time you're talking to someone. If they're matching your vibe, you've got more pull than you realize.

6. You get offers for help without asking

Strangers offering to grab something off a high shelf, coworkers volunteering to help with your project, people holding doors open longer than necessary. Attractiveness triggers prosocial behavior, meaning people want to be helpful and generous toward attractive individuals. It's called the ""what is beautiful is good"" stereotype in social psych. If you're getting unsolicited help regularly, people are subconsciously trying to get in your good graces.

7. Your flaws get reframed as quirks

Big nose? ""It's distinguished."" Loud laugh? ""So infectious."" Messy hair? ""Effortlessly cool."" When people are attracted to you, your ""flaws"" become endearing instead of dealbreakers. I saw this explained perfectly in ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer, former FBI behavioral analyst. He breaks down how attraction warps perception. If people describe your obvious imperfections as charming or unique, they're attracted to you and working backwards to justify it.

For anyone spiraling about this, the book ""The Confidence Gap"" by Russ Harris is insanely good at explaining why we're so bad at seeing ourselves accurately. Harris is an acceptance and commitment therapy expert and the book won multiple psychology awards. It teaches you how to separate your anxious thoughts from reality. Will genuinely change how you see yourself.

8. People get weirdly competitive around you

Your friend suddenly needs to one up your stories. A coworker starts peacocking when you enter the room. Someone keeps trying to prove how cool or successful they are unprompted. Competition signals perceived mate value in evolutionary psychology terms. If people are trying to outshine you, they see you as high value and feel threatened. It's annoying but it means you're more attractive than you think.

9. You get included in things you didn't really earn

Maybe you got invited to a party where you barely know anyone. Or added to a group chat. Or asked to join a project team when you're new. Attractive people get included more because others want them around. It creates social capital just having good looking people in your circle. If you're getting these random invites and thinking ""why me though,"" attractiveness is probably the answer.

10. People assume you're in a relationship

""Wait, you're single?"" If you hear this a lot, it's because people assume attractive individuals get snatched up quick. It's a backwards compliment. They're surprised you're available because they think you shouldn't be.

Look, here's what all this research really shows. Most of us are walking around with completely warped self images because our brains are wired to protect us from rejection by assuming the worst. We focus on the one person who didn't laugh at our joke instead of the five who did. We remember the bad haircut from 2019 but forget the compliment we got yesterday.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google experts that turns top psychology books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. You can ask it about any personal development goal, like improving self-perception or understanding attraction psychology, and it pulls from verified sources to create custom podcasts for you. The depth is fully adjustable, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia that creates adaptive learning plans based on your specific struggles and keeps evolving with you over time. Worth checking out if you want structured, science-backed content that actually fits your schedule.

You're very likely more attractive than you think. The gap between how you see yourself and how others see you is usually massive. Maybe sit with that for a minute instead of immediately dismissing it. Because if you're reading this and going ""yeah but not me though,"" that's exactly the cognitive bias I'm talking about.

Stop letting your brain gaslight you about your own face.

1q9tmk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q9tmk5/th_fan_of_sorrow/,[TH] Fan of Sorrow,"The rain was loud that night, the kind of rain that made the world  outside vanish into static. The thunder came in slow, deliberate rolls  that shook the windows of the small apartment. The air smelled of paint and anger.

Arjun slammed his bedroom door. The sound shot through the house like a gunshot. “Shut up!” he yelled, his voice trembling. “You and Pa are nothing but rotten apples hanging on a tree!”

The words burned his throat as they left him, and yet he didn’t want to take them back. Anger had momentum, it moved through him like current, impossible to stop once released. He sat on the bed, heart racing, cheeks flushed with rage and shame. His phone’s screen glowed beside him, mocking him with the dull emptiness of scrolling.

On the chair near the window hung his new party suit, ironed and perfect, waiting for the night that now seemed ruined.

Above him, the ceiling fan hummed with lazy indifference, slicing the thick air. But after a while, it slowed. Then stopped. The silence that followed was suffocating. Arjun frowned and stared up at it. The fan trembled once, and then began to spin again—only backward. Counterclockwise.

The lights flickered.

“Pa?” Arjun called out. “Something’s wrong with the fan!”

No reply. The air grew heavy. The wallpaper seemed to fade in color, graying like old skin. Dust lifted off the corners of the room and drifted in strange spirals.

Then came a whisper.

“My sweetest son… we tried. Maybe it’s easier to vanish than to rot before your eyes. As you said—we’re nothing but rotten apples overstaying our welcome on your tree.”

It was Ma’s voice.

Arjun froze. The world seemed to hold its breath. His eyes darted to the corner of the room, where a shape began to form,  it was Arjun himself, wearing the same party suit that lay folded on his chair. His skin was pale. His eyes were hollow. And in his trembling hand was a crumpled letter.

Then Pa’s voice followed, quiet and low, as if spoken through water.

“Forgive us. The locker in my cupboard holds what you need. The money. The key rests inside your comic book. We loved you… we love you still.”

Arjun’s chest constricted. He stumbled toward the door and beat his fists against it. “No! Don’t do this! Please, don’t leave me!” His hands throbbed, his knuckles split and bled. The wooden door beneath him began to feel like cold metal, impenetrable and dead.

Then, softly, it creaked open.

He stepped into the hallway.

The air smelled of coffee and rain. The shadows flickered, and then he saw them, his parents, hanging from ropes, swaying gently. Their faces were drained of life, lips gray, eyes half-open. The ropes creaked with every movement, slow and rhythmic, almost like breathing.

Arjun screamed. He clawed at the knots, sobbing, begging, pulling at their legs, their hands. The world blurred around him, the edges of the room melted like wet ink. His screams faded into silence.

When he opened his eyes again, he was back in his room. The same rain. The same bed. The same fan above, spinning normally once more.

“Arjun?”

He looked up. Pa was kneeling beside him, alive, his eyes full of concern. Ma stood by the door, holding the steaming rice cooker, her hair damp and frizzy. “What happened?” Pa asked softly.

Arjun stared at them. His tears hadn’t stopped. His mind couldn’t decide if this was mercy or punishment.

He didn’t sleep that night. The fan above hummed its steady rhythm, but he watched it like one watches a snake, ready for it to move wrong again. The rain whispered against the window, patient and endless.

In the morning, pale light spilled into the room. On his desk lay his comic book, its cover bent and familiar. He reached for it, flipping through the pages, until something metallic glinted within.

Inside were a small bottle of pills, a thin coil of rope, and a brass key. His fingers trembled. Next to them lay a folded note. He opened it carefully.

My sweetest son….

His stomach turned. The same handwriting. The same words.

He crushed the paper in his hand, his heart pounding with fury and fear. He stormed out of the room.

In the living room, Ma and Pa sat side by side on the sofa, sipping coffee like it was any other morning. Arjun slammed the pills, rope, and note onto the table. The sound made them both jump.

“What are you doing?” he shouted. “Sipping your last coffee before you hang yourselves?”

Pa’s lips parted. “Arjun.”

“I found it,” Arjun hissed. “The rope, the pills, the key. What are you planning?”

Ma’s hand trembled as she reached for Pa. “We… we don’t know what to say,” she whispered.

Arjun snatched their cups and hurled them across the hall. They shattered against the wall, brown coffee streaking down like blood. He glared at them, breathing hard.

“Didn’t expect me to find it, did you, Ma?”

The ceiling fan stopped. The lights flickered, humming like a dying pulse. The blades began to spin backward again.

Arjun clutched his head. “No! Not again! This started it all!”

“What started what?” Ma cried.

“I don’t know! It happened before!” His voice cracked. “I think I’m losing my mind!”

The hallway blurred, colors washing away like wet paint.

When his vision cleared, he was back in his room again. The night had returned. The moonlight bled across the floor in silver streaks. The house was silent, emptier than before.

Arjun knelt on the floor, the crushed note in his hand.

“Why?” Ma’s voice whispered faintly.

He looked up, startled. “Why what?”

His voice sounded strange, hollow, like someone else’s first. No, it was his own voice.

In the corner, Arjun in the party suit stood again. He looked calmer now, though his expression carried something like pity. It was a figure.

“Why did you throw the cups at them?” the figure asked.

Arjun’s lips trembled. “You sound like me.”

“That’s because I am you,” said the figure quietly.

“A manifestation?”

“No,” he said. “We’re not the kind of people who manifest.”

Arjun stared at the figure. His own face, his own voice, but colder and wearing that same party suit. “What are you then?”

“I’m what you left behind,” the figure said. “The part of you that still wants to fix what you broke.”

Arjun felt his knees weaken. “I didn’t mean to hurt them. I was just angry. They didn’t let me go to the party, that’s all.”

“Do you know what day that was?”

“What are you talking about?”

The figure’s voice cracked. “It was Ma’s birthday. You forgot. All they wanted was a quiet dinner together, to feel loved. But instead, you called them rotten apples. You threw cups at them. You made them believe you didn’t care.”

Arjun’s breath hitched. He saw flashes, the look on Ma’s face when he shouted, Pa’s silence that followed. “I didn’t know,” he whispered.

“But you do now,” said the figure. “And you saw what happened after. You saw them hanging.”

Arjun’s eyes filled with tears. “What do I do? Everything’s over. I can’t change it.”

The figure stepped closer. “You believe in chances?”

“I do.”

“Then take one.”

“Do I get another?”

The figure smiled faintly. “Not a second. A third.”

Arjun looked down. “If I go to them, will they forget all this?”

“It’s all in your head,” said the figure. “Go seek forgiveness.”

“I’ll try,” Arjun whispered. “But will they forgive me?”

“Take a chance,” the figure said softly. “Do what you can with what you have.”

The figure began to fade, dissolving into the light.

“Wait,” Arjun said, reaching out. “What about you?”

There was only silence. The figure faded like ashes.

Arjun turned toward the door. It stood slightly open, light seeping through the crack. He took a deep breath and stepped out.

In the living room, Ma and Pa sat together on the sofa, their eyes swollen from crying. When they looked up, they froze. Arjun stood there, trembling.

“Why don’t we go out for dinner tonight?” he said softly. “I had a surprise planned for you, Ma. Don’t think I forgot your birthday.”

Ma’s lips parted, her eyes wide with disbelief. Pa reached for her hand. Arjun moved closer and hugged them both tightly. For the first time in months, he felt warmth, real and alive.

Behind him, the door to his room creaked shut on its own.

Arjun turned his head, saw it close fully, and smiled faintly. The fan above hummed again, its rhythm steady and calm.

Outside, the rain still fell, whispering against the windows. But inside the small apartment, there was peace, the kind that comes only when sorrow has said all it needed to say.

four years ago a friend told me about a boy and said he was “like warm coffee on a winter morning,” and somehow that sentence changed my life, because we started talking and then calling and then staying on the phone until 4 a.m. like sleep didn’t matter when love was involved.  
My parents were strict so we couldn’t be normal, no cafes or parks or pretty Instagram dates, only stolen moments, him sneaking into my house when no one was home, us sitting with my head on his shoulder, him bringing me chocolate and tiny bouquets that I hid inside books before my parents came back, once ordering coffee and forgetting to drink it because we were too busy kissing until it went cold, taking a few secret photos and nothing more, being as far from normal as two people could be and still being happier than I’d ever been.  
Until one day, everything went wrong and after that fear lived in our bodies and we tried to break up and couldn’t. I then lost access to my phone and the internet so we couldn’t talk or meet but we still existed, there was still an “us,” and we kept hoping that someday the waiting would end.  
On my 15th birthday he made me a journal by hand and snuck a blue cake into school that said “to the moon and back,” and inside the journal he wrote all the ordinary holy things he wanted for us like rubbing our feet together under blankets, making coffee on tired mornings, finding an apartment and painting its walls.  
He was there for me when I hated my body and when friendships fell apart and when home felt heavy, and I was there for him too while he fought his own mind, sometimes just holding him while he cried because loving someone doesn’t always mean being able to fix them.  
When I finally got my phone back and called to say we could talk again he told me he had spoken to his mother and that he didn’t want to be the person who ruined my life no matter how much he loved me, and I begged and he said he wanted something normal and that was the end of us.  
I threw myself into my studies and tried to date other people and no one felt like him, and then I found out he was with someone else not even 60 days after we ended while still texting me for months and I fed myself hope like it was medicine even though it was poison.

a year later I found an old account where he had been writing to me when I couldn’t answer, small pieces of his life and “I miss you” and “I wish you were here,” messages that slowly showed how much he was struggling, and one of the songs he sent me back then was ""Things that I miss"" by awfultune , and the last thing he wrote was that he couldn’t do this anymore.  
I still carry the fact that I didn’t know how much he was hurting while I was gone, so now when I hear this song all I hear is something that used to belong to two people echoing inside one.  
*it used to be our song and now there is no us.*  
and if somehow he ever reads this years from now in some other life I need him to know he was never just a chapter to me, he was a whole language, the boy who made me believe in small miracles like blue cakes and hidden flowers and cold coffee and love that existed even when it wasn’t allowed to, and I am so sorry for every moment he felt alone while I couldn’t reach him and for the ways circumstances broke us when neither of us wanted to be broken, because I never stopped caring about him even when we became strangers, and wherever he is, I hope he is safe and held gently and living the kind of life we used to dream about, and if one day in ten years or twenty he ever thinks of me just know this,

It shows up in the tiny everyday stuff you only notice after living with someone how long he showers, how attached he is to his barber, how he treats his phone, how easily his ego gets poked. I’ve seen this pattern repeat again and again across charts, countries, and cultures. The planet stays the same, only the hairstyle changes.

Here’s how it plays out in real life.

**Mars + Sun**  
This guy knows his good angle. Either zero selfies or full royal-pose energy. Clothes are clean, shoes are polished, posture matters. He sticks to the same barber for years because loyalty feels like identity. Long hot showers, bathroom feels like his personal office. Even small jokes can bruise his ego if they sound disrespectful.

**Mars + Moon**

1q9th8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1q9th8p/changes_to_mugs/,Changes to Mugs?,"Morning all.

So I've been thinking about mugs and how they don't make a lot of sense in AF, as the only way to get them is from the coffee machines. I feel like they should be much easier to get in at least the office and kitchen areas of the games - maybe a few on top of work surfaces and desks, as well as a % spawn chance in cupboards and desks - and perhaps even a twofer with pens as storing pens in mugs is pretty common and makes sense (but would require a small adjustment to the model in-game).

Making them more useful would also be good. An example could be a new cooking recipe where you use a mug, a wheat and an egg to make a cupcake in a mug. Or, of course, use them as drinking vessels like bottles and store \~250ml of water in them. I just think there is more we could do with mugs and making them easier to get wouldn't affect the game balance but instead make the world feel more lived-in and accurate to life.",7,1768117655.0,AbioticFactor,1,1.0,False

While on Vyvanse they told me not to have any caffeine but even before that, I've not been one to drink much caffeine. The most I would have is whatever amount is in some sodas, but it was extremely rare for me to drink coffee or energy drinks. Usually when I did I would end up feeling super jittery and hyper because my body just wasnt used to stimulants like that.

However after having been on Vyvanse and a decently high dose of it, my body can handle caffeine FAR more now. 80mg before would have been enough to have me shaking, now I can have 80mg and not even notice any affects.

Since I've gone from being on a stimulant every single day to now nothing, I've found myself using caffeine to help get through the day.

Never an absurd amount, usually no more then around 200mg at most in a day, but I'm just wondering if it's okay to basically rely on it in order to get through the day. I still struggle to be productive now that I'm not on an ADHD medication, but without caffeine I struggle to even do anything other than lying in bed.

TLDR: I was on a stimulant medication but stopped, now I need caffeine in order to get through the day. Is that okay?",1,1768117585.0,TooAfraidToAsk,1,0.67,False

“It’s a sauna in there,” Space Sergeant Butch Calhoun muttered as he emerged from the Myung-ho Chae Recreation Facility (MCRF) into the sterile darkness of the hyper-filtered air.

Why was there a recreation facility named after Myung-ho Chae? Well, he was a Cosmic Corps legend. A planetary engineer serving in the early days, he was heroically crushed to death by twenty-seven tons of paper files while conducting an inspection based on the rumor of an improperly formatted decimal point sometime in 2037.

The Cosmic Corps Ball, which occurred deca-biannually, was winding down; it was almost time to start planning the next one in eighteen days. Orbiters, as the personnel of the Cosmic Corps were called, spent fifty-four percent of their time planning events. Butch removed his “throwback” suit jacket, which made him look like a low-budget airline pilot, and his starched dress shirt and hung them on the railing beside the building’s back exit. He intended to return for them later, but never did.

Butch had made a responsible decision to walk back to his quarters, as he had a few too many foams. Beer was too heavy to regularly transport from Earth, so Orbiters drank foam. It was a beverage made locally from fermenting a mash of a bioluminescent moss, which was the only vegetation on Glozanth IX, a Class-M-Questionable planet located in the Snörple Drift, a chaotic star cluster infamous for failed experiments. The closest taste an Earthling could associate it with would be wasabi.

He wasn’t far from the MCRF when someone shouted out,
“Hey, stop!”

A skinny, pale, blond Orbiter in an orange and teal Class Beta uniform bearing a rank junior to Butch’s urgently ran up to him.

“You’re in breach of Cosmic Corps Regulation Manual 94X-3A!” he shouted at Butch, and stood on his toes to get a better look.
“And you’re intoxicated! You’re a danger to yourself and others!”

The junior Orbiter wrapped his arms around Butch and attempted to pick him up. Butch was burly, strapping even, and didn’t budge when the young Orbiter tried to apprehend him. Butch put “Drizzle”, at least that was the name embroidered on his uniform, into a headlock. He was deciding whether to let Drizzle go, or to rough him up to teach him a lesson, when he was interrupted by more shouting.

“Hey!”

Become a member
A group of three Orbiters had been walking down the same sidewalk several hundred feet behind Drizzle, and saw him in Butch’s clutches. Butch wasn’t about to let Drizzle go, but he saw what he thought was a foam-induced apparition… Drizzle licked his own eyeball.

Butch was trying to understand what he was seeing as the footsteps of the other Orbiters rapidly approached, then he felt the cold, slimy sensation of Drizzle licking his arm. Butch instinctively threw him onto the ground in a heap at the feet of the other Orbiters who had arrived to rescue him.

Such a display could only mean one thing: this guy was a Zarv in disguise.

The Zar’Vokian were mankind’s mortal enemy in the galaxy, a bipedal lizard-like race. It all started centuries ago, an incident that has been mythologized in Zar’Vokian folklore as “The Great Slight of Zar’Vok-Tuun.” A simple misunderstanding during the First Contact Summit on the neutral moon Diplomia-9, a human ambassador accidentally served ranch dressing to the Zar’Vokian diplomat Zar’Vok-Tuun, who had explicitly requested “the creamy white sauce made of fermented spores and crushed lava hornets.”

The result was instant purging for Zar’Vok-Tuun; more plainly, public diarrhea. The humans laughed, the Zar’Vokians vowed revenge.

What humans saw as a “harmless mix-up,” the Zar’Vokians viewed as an unforgivable spiritual desecration of their sacred gut biome. Unlike traditional warfare, the Zar’Vokians believe in “a thousand humiliations over one clean kill.”

Their tactics had thus far been: swapping salt with sugar in the Myng-ho Chae (a different Myung-ho Chae) Chow Hall (MCCH), adjusting all the chairs to be slightly too low, replacing caffeinated coffee with decaffeinated coffee, reprogramming base AI assistants to refer to the Orbiters as “toots”, and secretly installing bidets that announce “shame detected!” when used.

Each successful infiltration was followed by a ritual celebration, during which human prisoners of war are forced to wear giant fruit-shaped hats while having their buttocks gently whipped by the tails of Zar’Vokians circled around them in a conga line during a communal dance, while the event is broadcast to the Zar’Vokian Parliament, who hiss in approval while sipping from tiny mugs.

“He’s a Zarv spy,” Butch said plainly, pointing to Drizzle.

Drizzle whined as the other Orbiters helped him to his feet.
“He’s a crazy drunk!” Drizzle pointed accusingly at Butch.

“Whoa, calm it down Orbiter. We don’t need to be put on lockdown, just go sleep it off,” one of the strangers cautioned Butch, while another summoned the Cosmic Cops from his watch.

Orbiters wore watches that could make phone calls; they also monitored their blood sugar and video game usage. Orbiters were required to play video games for forty-two hours a week; it helped keep their testosterone and interest in the opposite, or same, sex to a minimum, giving them more time to plan parties.

Butch turned around to walk away, but before he could take more than a few steps the lights and sirens of two Cosmic Cops zipping to the scene on hover-cycles overtook him. They asked no questions. They simply blasted the group with an energy net, rendering them helpless, and dragged them to the Myung-ho Chae Law Enforcement Center (MCLEC) to sort it out.

They quickly determined that Butch was the primary suspect and put him into a cell alone. He did the only thing he knew to do in confinement, push-ups and various calisthenics.

Drizzle feigned dizziness and fell to his hands and knees, exaggerating his non-existent injuries while the others gave statements to the Cosmic Cops. One ran to get a pain reliever and water, the other ran to get a tourniquet, and in the confusion Drizzle, who was in fact a Zarv infiltrator, slinked out of the MCLEC and into the night.

# THE INVENTORY

**FBI Washington Field Office**  
**February 19, 2001**  
**3:47 AM**

Special Agent Kate Martinez hasn't slept in thirty-six hours.

She sits in a windowless room on the fourth floor, surrounded by documents. They cover every surface... the table, the chairs, parts of the floor. Classified documents. Marked in red ink with warnings. TOP SECRET. EYES ONLY. COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION.

Each one is a piece of what Robert Hanssen gave away.

Each one is a piece of the puzzle they're trying to assemble. Because arresting him was just the first step. Now they need to understand the full scope of the damage…. need to inventory every operation he compromised…. every source he exposed…. every secret he sold.

It's going to take months. Maybe years. But they need to start now.

Martinez picks up a document from the pile. It's a technical schematic. Detailed drawings of electronic surveillance equipment. The kind of equipment the NSA uses to monitor communications…. the kind that takes years to develop and costs millions to deploy.

***Hanssen gave this to the Russians in 1987.***

Within a year, the equipment stopped working. The Russians had developed countermeasures. Had built systems that made the surveillance useless. The NSA spent another decade and another fortune trying to catch up.

She sets the document aside. Picks up another.

This one is a list of names. Soviet intelligence officers working in the United States who had been recruited by the FBI. Double agents. Men who had risked everything to provide information to America.

***Hanssen gave this list to the KGB in 1985.***

Some of the names have small notations in the margin. Written in pencil. Martinez knows what those notations mean.

**Executed.**

She stares at the names.

*Valeriy Fedorovich Martynov. Executed 1987.*  
*Sergey Mikhailovich Motorin. Executed 1987.*  
*Boris Nikolayevich Yuzhin. Imprisoned, survived.*

Three men… three lives. All destroyed because of a list.

Because Hanssen needed to prove he had access… demonstrate his value. Needed to show the KGB that he was worth paying for.

Martinez has been an FBI agent for twelve years. Has worked counterintelligence for eight. She thought she understood betrayal. Thought she had seen every variation of human weakness... the agent who sells secrets for money, the diplomat who betrays his country for ideology, the businessman who trades information for power.

**But this is different. This is not about money or ideology or power.**

This is about something else entirely.

The door opens. Special Agent David Chen walks in, carrying another box of documents. He looks as exhausted as Martinez feels. His shirt is wrinkled…. his tie is loose. There's a coffee stain on his sleeve.

*""More?""* Martinez asks.

Chen nods. Sets the box on the table. *""From his house. Found these in a crawl space above his bedroom closet.""*

Martinez opens the box.

Inside are computer diskettes. Twenty-six of them. Each one labeled with dates and codes. She picks one up. The label reads: **""MONOPOLY - Technical Specs - 06/1987.""**

She knows what MONOPOLY is. Everyone in counterintelligence knows.

It was the most ambitious technical surveillance operation in FBI history. A tunnel dug beneath the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. Took years to plan, cost hundreds of millions to construct. The idea was simple: tap into the embassy's communications directly. Intercept everything. Calls, cables, computer data.

**The tunnel was nearly complete when someone told the Soviets it existed.**

The operation was compromised before it ever went operational.

The FBI spent years trying to figure out who had blown MONOPOLY. They investigated everyone who had access. Polygraphed them…. interviewed them… followed them. But found nothing.

Because the person who compromised it was one of the investigators.

Martinez slides the diskette back into the box. Her hands are shaking slightly. Not from fear… from anger.

Chen sits down across from her. His face is grim.

*""How bad is it?""* he asks.

Martinez looks at the documents covering the table. At the names of dead men. At the technical specifications of billion-dollar programs. At the operational plans for missions that will now never happen.

*""Bad,""* she says. *""Worse than Ames. Maybe worse than anyone.""*

Chen is quiet for a moment. Then: *""What was he getting paid?""*

It's the obvious question. The question everyone asks when someone betrays their country. How much was he getting paid? What was his price?

Martinez has already seen the financial analysis. The forensic accountants have been through Hanssen's bank records. His investments, his property holdings. They've tracked every dollar they can find.

*""One point four million,""* she says. *""Over twenty-two years.""*

Chen does the math in his head. *""That's... sixty-four thousand a year.""*

*""Give or take.""*

*""That's it?""*

*""That's it.""*

They sit in silence, trying to process this. Sixty-four thousand dollars a year. It's not nothing. But it's not exactly life-changing money either. It's less than what a mid-level FBI agent makes. Less than what Hanssen himself was earning.

For sixty-four thousand dollars a year, he destroyed operations worth billions. Got men killed, compromised sources that took decades to develop. Undermined American intelligence at its most fundamental level.

***""So it wasn't about money,""*** Chen says.

Martinez shakes her head***. ""No. It wasn't about money.""***

***""Then what was it about?""***

She doesn't have an answer. Not yet. But she's starting to form one. Starting to see a pattern in the documents Hanssen chose to betray. They're not random…. they're not just whatever he could get his hands on.

They're significant, important. The kind of operations that would make headlines if they became public. The kind of secrets that prove you have access to everything.

It's almost like he was collecting trophies. Like he was building a resume….trying to prove something.

**But prove what? And to whom?**

Martinez picks up another document. This one is a CIA report on KGB organizational structure. Detailed breakdown of which officers report to which departments. Who has authority over what. The kind of internal intelligence that only someone with deep access could provide.

**Hanssen gave this to the Russians in 1986.**

Why would they need their own organizational chart? They already knew their own structure.

Unless...

Unless the point wasn't to give them useful information.

**The point was to prove he had it.**

Martinez looks up at Chen.

***""I don't think he was spying for the Russians,""*** she says slowly.

Chen frowns**.** *""What do you mean? He gave them everything.""*

*""I mean... I don't think that was the point. The point wasn't to help them. The point was to prove he could.""*

Chen still looks confused.

Martinez tries to find the right words. *""Most spies, when you catch them, they're sorry. Or they're defiant…. tryi to justify what they did. They have a story. I did it for money…. I did it for ideology…. did it because someone blackmailed me.""*

*""But Hanssen?""*

***""When they arrested him, he asked, 'What took you so long?'""***

Chen leans back in his chair. *""Jesus.""*

***""He wanted to get caught,""*** Martinez says. ***""Or no, not caught exactly. He wanted to be known... wanted people to understand how clever he'd been. How long he'd gotten away with it.""***

*""That's insane.""*

*""Is it?""* Martinez gestures at the documents. *""Look at what he kept. All of this was in his house... in his office. He documented everything, kept records. It's like he was building a monument to himself.""*

Chen is quiet, thinking.

Martinez continues: *""And the money. He told the KGB he couldn't spend it… couldn't invest it. It was just sitting there. He didn't need it, but he kept taking it anyway.""*

*""Why?""*

***""Because that's how you keep score.""***

The words hang in the air.

Chen stands up, walks to the window. Outside, dawn is breaking over Washington. The sky is turning from black to grey. Soon, the city will wake up. People will go to work. Will drink their coffee and read their newspapers and live their normal lives.

They'll have no idea what happened last night.

No idea that one of the most damaging spies in American history was arrested while placing a package under a bridge.

No idea that right now, in this room, two exhausted agents are trying to piece together the full extent of his betrayal.

Chen turns back to Martinez.

*""So if it wasn't about money,""* he says*, ""and it wasn't about ideology, what was it about?""*

Martinez looks at the documents. At the names of dead men. At the wreckage of two decades of espionage.

***""I think,""*** she says quietly, ***""it was about being special.""***

 

# THE NAMES

**Moscow, USSR**  
**May 1987**  
**Two Years Earlier**

The cell is cold.

Valeriy Martynov can see his breath in the dim light. Can feel the concrete floor through his thin prison uniform. Can hear the sound of footsteps in the corridor outside, getting closer.

He knows what the footsteps mean.

He's known since the moment they arrested him at the Moscow airport…. the moment they put him in this cell…. the moment the interrogators showed him the evidence.

A list… his name on a list.

An American list.

They wouldn't tell him where the list came from, wouldn't tell him who had provided it. Just showed it to him and asked if he wanted to confess.

**He confessed.**

What else could he do? The list was real… his name was on it. The Americans had recruited him three years ago, when he was assigned to the Soviet Embassy in Washington. They had approached him carefully, had promised him protection.

They lied.

Or maybe they didn't lie…. maybe they just didn't know. Didn't know that someone in their own organization was providing lists to the KGB…. that recruiting a Soviet intelligence officer was essentially signing his death warrant.

The footsteps stop outside his cell. The door opens.

Two guards enter. They don't speak. Don't need to. Martynov stands…. his legs are shaky. He hasn't eaten in three days…. hasn't slept in longer than that.

They lead him down the corridor.

He knows where they're taking him…. knows what room waits at the end, and what will happen there.

They tried to get him to give up other names, to tell them about other KGB officers who might have been recruited by the Americans. But he didn't know any other names. He'd been careful. Had insisted on individual meetings…. and had never asked about other sources.

It didn't matter. They didn't believe him.

Or maybe they did believe him and just didn't care.

The corridor seems to go on forever. Fluorescent lights overhead… green paint peeling from the walls. The smell of disinfectant and something else… something organic. Something that makes Martynov's stomach turn.

They reach the room. The door is metal… Thick, soundproof.

One of the guards opens it. Inside, a single chair…. and a drain in the floor.

Martynov stops walking.

The guards push him forward.

He wants to resist. Wants to fight, scream. But his body won't obey. His legs carry him into the room. His hands allow themselves to be restrained. His mouth stays closed.

Because what's the point?

He's been dead since the moment his name appeared on that list.

The last thing Valeriy Martynov thinks about... the very last thought before the world goes away... is his family. His wife… his daughter. They'll be told he was a traitor. They'll lose their apartment, their privileges, their place in society.

**All because his name was on a list….because someone in America decided he was worth sixty-four thousand dollars a year.**

 

**The Same Day**  
**Different Cell**  
**Same Building**

Sergey Motorin doesn't confess.

When they show him the list... when they point to his name... he denies everything. Says it's fabricated, the Americans are trying to discredit loyal Soviet officers.

They show him more evidence. Photographs of his meetings with FBI handlers... recordings of conversations, bank records showing payments made to accounts he thought were secure.

He still denies it…. so they beat him.

Not in anger or in passion. Just methodically, professionally. Apply pressure until something breaks… and the truth comes out.

It takes three days.

On the third day, Motorin tells them everything.

He tells them about his recruitment. About the meetings in Washington parks, about the information he passed, about the money he was paid, about the promises the FBI made.

He tells them about the fear. The constant, grinding fear of discovery. The way he couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't look his colleagues in the eye without wondering if they knew.

He tells them he wanted to stop. Wanted to go back to being a loyal Soviet officer. But the FBI wouldn't let him…. said he was in too deep, if he stopped cooperating, they'd expose him anyway.

So he kept going. Kept passing information. Kept betraying his country.

Until someone in America decided to betray him.

The interrogators write everything down. They're thorough professional. They want a complete record…. something they can use at the trial.

Not that the trial will matter…. everyone knows how this ends.

When they're done with the interrogation, they take Motorin back to his cell. He's barely conscious, can barely walk. The guards have to carry him.

They throw him on the concrete floor and lock the door.

Motorin lies there in the dark, trying to remember why he agreed to work for the Americans in the first place.

Was it the money? It was good money, better than his KGB salary.

Was it ideology? He'd never been a true believer. Never really bought into the communist system.

Was it excitement? The thrill of living a double life?

He can't remember anymore.

All he can remember is the fear…. and now, even the fear is gone.

He's going to die. That's certain. The only question is when. Days? Weeks? They might drag it out. Might use him to try to identify other American sources. Might parade him at a show trial.

Or they might just take him to that room. The one at the end of the corridor… the one with the metal door.

Either way, he's dead.

Sergey Motorin closes his eyes and thinks about his name on a list.

Somewhere in America, someone typed his name.

Someone sat at a desk and decided his life was worth trading for money or favor or career advancement.

Someone made that choice…. and now he's going to pay for it.

 

**FBI Washington Field Office**  
**Present Day - February 19, 2001**  
**4:23 AM**

Martinez stares at the names.

Martynov. Motorin.

**Both executed in 1987. Both betrayed by Hanssen's first letter to the KGB.**

She tries to imagine what Hanssen felt when he typed those names. Did his hands shake? Did he hesitate? Did he think about the men he was condemning to death?

Or did he just see them as entries on a list? As proof of his access? As the price of admission to his secret club?

The document in her hand includes notes from the debriefing of a Russian intelligence officer who defected in the 1990s. He'd been involved in the investigation of Martynov and Motorin. Had been present at their interrogations.

**One detail stands out.**

According to the defector, the KGB was initially skeptical of the list Hanssen provided. They thought it might be disinformation, a trick. The Americans trying to sow paranoia within Soviet intelligence.

So they investigated carefully. Cross-referenced the names against their own internal intelligence…. watched the suspects for weeks.

And then, when they were certain, they arrested them.

Martinez imagines Hanssen learning about the executions. Did someone tell him? Did he read about it in classified cables? Did he feel anything at all?

**The evidence suggests he felt satisfied.**

In a later letter to the KGB... one recovered from Hanssen's home... he mentions the case obliquely. Talks about how close American intelligence came to protecting one of their sources. How lucky the KGB was that certain American officers *""didn't have the balls or brains""* to act in time.

He's boasting…. proud of how well his information worked.

**Proud of the men he killed.**

Martinez sets the document down. Her hands are steady, but inside, something is burning. She's investigated murderers, rapists, terrorists. But this feels different.

This feels personal.

Because Hanssen didn't just kill Martynov and Motorin. He killed them from inside the system that was supposed to protect them. He used his access... his clearance, his position, his trust... to identify men who had risked everything to help America.

And then he sold them…. for money he couldn't spend.

For a game he couldn't stop playing…. for reasons no one can fully understand.

Chen comes back into the room. He's holding a phone.

*""The director wants an update,""* he says.

Martinez looks at the documents covering the table. At the inventory of betrayal, they've barely started to process.

*""Tell him,""* she says, *""that it's going to be a long day.""*

# THE QUESTION

**FBI Interrogation Room**  
**Washington Field Office**  
**February 18, 2001**  
**11:34 PM**

The room is small… windowless. A table, three chairs. Fluorescent lights that make everything look slightly unreal, and slightly clinical.

Robert Hanssen sits on one side of the table. His hands are cuffed in front of him. His suit is wrinkled from being tackled in the park… there's dirt on his sleeve. But his face is calm. Expressionless…. like he's waiting for a dentist appointment.

Across from him sit two FBI agents. Special Agent Thomas O'Connor, who made the arrest. And Special Agent Kate Martinez, who's been building the case against him for months.

Between them, on the table, there is a digital recorder. The red light is on. Everything is being documented, and everything will be part of the record.

O'Connor speaks first.

*""Mr. Hanssen, you've been read your rights. Do you understand them?""*

Hanssen nods. *""I do.""*

*""Do you wish to have an attorney present?""*

*""Not at this time.""*

Martinez and O'Connor exchange a glance. Most people, when arrested for espionage, immediately lawyer up. Refuse to say anything, and demand representation. The fact that Hanssen is willing to talk... even just to answer procedural questions... is unusual.

O'Connor continues. *""Mr. Hanssen, we arrested you tonight at Foxstone Park in Vienna, Virginia. We observed you placing a package under the footbridge. Do you wish to make a statement about that?""*

Hanssen is quiet for a moment. His eyes move from O'Connor to Martinez and back. Calculating. Assessing.

*""What was in the package?""* he asks.

O'Connor leans back in his chair. *""You tell us.""*

*""I'd rather not.""*

*""Mr. Hanssen, we've already recovered the package. We know what's in it. Classified documents. Seven pounds of material marked Top Secret. Technical specification, operational details, names of active intelligence sources.""*

Hanssen says nothing.

Martinez speaks for the first time. Her voice is calm, professional. But there's an edge to it.

*""We've also searched your home, your office, car. We've found computer diskettes, letters, financial records. We know about the dead drops…. about the money…. about the KGB contacts.""*

Still nothing from Hanssen.

Martinez continues. *""We have your fingerprints on packaging materials. We have your voice on recordings. We have testimony from Russian intelligence officers who've identified you as their source.""*

She pauses.

*""Mr. Hanssen, we have everything. The question now is whether you want to help yourself by cooperating. Or whether you want to make this harder than it needs to be.""*

Hanssen looks at her…. for the first time since the interrogation began, something flickers behind his eyes. Not fear, or guilt.

**Interest.**

*""How long have you known?""* he asks.

O'Connor and Martinez exchange another glance. This is not the question they were expecting.

*""Known what?""* O'Connor asks.

*""How long have you known it was me?""*

Martinez decides to answer honestly. *""We identified you as a suspect in late 2000. We paid a Russian intelligence officer seven million dollars for your file. The file contained recordings, fingerprints, documents with your handwriting.""*

Hanssen nods slowly. Processing this.

*""Seven million,""* he says. *""That's quite a bit more than they paid me.""*

There's something in his tone. Not quite amusement…. not bitterness. Something in between.

O'Connor leans forward. *""Mr. Hanssen, why did you do it?""*

This is the question. The question everyone wants answered. The question that will define this case and this moment and this man's entire legacy.

Hanssen is quiet for a long time.

The recorder keeps running, the fluorescent lights keep humming, the room feels smaller somehow.

When Hanssen finally speaks, his voice is soft. … almost conversational.

*""Do you know what it's like,""* he says, *""to be invisible?""*

O'Connor and Martinez say nothing. Let him talk.

*""I worked for the FBI for twenty-five years,""* Hanssen continues. *""Twenty-five years. I had three degrees. I understood computers better than anyone in the Bureau. I tried to introduce new methodologies, better systems. I saw inefficiencies everywhere, saw problems that needed fixing.""*

He pauses.

*""No one listened.""*

Martinez waits. There's more coming… she can feel it.

*""I'd sit in meetings,""* Hanssen says, *""and watch people make decisions that were obviously wrong, inefficient. I'd propose solutions… but they'd ignore me. Or they'd just smile and nod and then do exactly what they were going to do anyway.""*

His voice hasn't risen. It's still that same flat, measured tone. Like he's describing the weather.

*""So I decided to prove it,""* he says.

*""Prove what?""* O'Connor asks.

*""That I was smarter than all of them.""*

The words hang in the air.

Martinez feels something cold settle in her stomach. Because she's starting to understand…. starting to see the pattern.

*""You didn't do it for money,""* she says.

*""The money was useful,""* Hanssen replies. *""But no. That wasn't the point.""*

*""You didn't do it for ideology.""*

*""I have no use for ideology.""*

*""Then what was the point?""*

Hanssen looks directly at her. And for just a moment, the mask slips. For just a moment, she sees something behind his eyes…. something wounded and angry and desperately hungry for recognition.

*""The point,""* he says quietly, *""was to prove I could.""*

 

O'Connor and Martinez sit in silence after Hanssen is taken back to his cell. The recorder is off…. the fluorescent lights are still humming.

*""That's it?""* O'Connor finally says. *""He did it to prove he was smart?""*

Martinez shakes her head. *""It's not that simple.""*

*""Sounds pretty simple to me. Guy has an ego problem. Thinks he's smarter than everyone else…. and decides to prove it by committing treason.""*

*""It's more than ego,""* Martinez says. She's thinking about the documents they've been reviewing. The meticulous records, the trophy collection, the way Hanssen documented everything.

*""He didn't just want to be smart*,"" she says. *""He wanted to be known. Wanted people to understand how clever he'd been. How long he'd gotten away with it…. how he'd outsmarted the entire intelligence community.""*

*""For twenty-two years.""*

*""For twenty-two years.""*

O'Connor stands up…. stretches. He's exhausted.

*""You know what the worst part is?""* he says.

*""What?""*

***""He's right. He did outsmart us. For twenty-two years, we had no idea. We investigated everyone else. We ruined Brian Kelley's life. We spent millions of dollars chasing ghosts… and the whole time, the ghost was sitting in an office two floors down, watching us fail.""***

Martinez doesn't respond, because he's right. Hanssen did outsmart them. Did prove he was better at the game than anyone else.

And that knowledge... that bitter, undeniable knowledge... is going to haunt the FBI for decades.

O'Connor moves toward the door…. then stops. Turns back.

*""When you arrested him,""* Martinez says, *""when you put the cuffs on, what did you feel?""*

O'Connor thinks about it.

*""Relief,""* he says finally. *""That we caught him…. it's over.""*

*""Is it over?""*

*""What do you mean?""*

Martinez gestures vaguely. *""The arrest is over. The investigation is just beginning. We need to figure out everything he compromised, everyone he exposed, every operation he destroyed. That's going to take years.""*

*""I know.""*

*""And even when we're done, even when we think we've found everything, we'll never really know. Because we'll never know what he didn't tell us. What he's still hiding…. what secrets he's taking to his grave.""*

O'Connor is quiet.

*""That's what he wanted,""* Martinez says. *""Not just to prove he was smart. To prove he was unknowable…. to prove that no matter how much we investigate, no matter how much we learn, there will always be parts of him we can't reach. Parts that stay hidden.""*

*""You think he's still playing games?""*

***""I think he never stopped.""***

 

**Foxstone Park**  
**February 19, 2001**  
**Dawn**

The crime scene techs are still processing the bridge when the sun comes up.

Yellow tape marks the perimeter, floodlights illuminate the footbridge, photographers document every angle. Evidence collection specialists carefully retrieve the package from beneath the bridge.

Special Agent David Chen stands at the edge of the tape, watching them work.

He's thinking about the question Hanssen asked during the arrest.

*What took you so long?*

Twenty-two years. That's how long it took. Twenty-two years of Hanssen moving through the FBI, accessing classified information, making dead drops, collecting payments. Twenty-two years of him sitting in meetings, attending training sessions, working on investigations.

Twenty-two years of him being invisible.

How many times had Chen passed Hanssen in the hallway? How many times had they been in the same room? How many times had Hanssen been right there, and no one noticed?

Chen watches as the techs carefully place the package in an evidence bag. Seven pounds of classified documents. The last delivery in a career of betrayal.

But not the last secret.

Because even now, even with Hanssen in custody, Chen knows they don't have the full picture. Don't understand the complete scope of what he did, don't know all the operations he compromised, all the sources he exposed.

They might never know. That's the thing about ghosts.

Even after you catch them, they never really disappear.

 

**FBI Headquarters**  
**Office of the Director**  
**February 19, 2001**  
**8:15 AM**

FBI Director Louis Freeh sits behind his desk, reading the preliminary report on the Hanssen arrest.

His face shows nothing. But inside, he's reeling.

**Twenty-two years.**

One of his own agents. Someone who took the same oath, who carried the same badge, who was supposed to uphold the same principles.

**A traitor.**

Not just any traitor. According to the initial assessment, Hanssen may have caused more damage to American intelligence than any spy in history. More than Ames…. more than Walker. More than anyone.

And he did it from inside the FBI.

Freeh's phone rings. He picks it up.

*""Sir, the Attorney General is on line one. The CIA Director is on line two. The National Security Advisor is holding on line three.""*

Freeh closes his eyes…. takes a breath. This is going to be a long day. A long year. A long investigation.

But at least it's over. At least they caught him. The ghost has finally been exposed.

Except...

Freeh opens his eyes, looks at the report again.

*One detail bothers him.*

When asked why he did it, Hanssen said he wanted to prove he was smarter than everyone else.

And in a way, he did. He outsmarted the FBI for twenty-two years…. outsmarted the CIA…. outsmarted every security system and protocol and investigation.

Until a Russian intelligence officer, motivated by seven million dollars, handed over his file.

That's what finally caught him.

**Not American intelligence, not FBI investigative techniques, not brilliant detective work.**

Just money. Changing hands in Moscow.

Freeh picks up the phone. Presses the button for line one.

*""Mr. Attorney General,""* he says. *""We need to talk.""*

 

# EPILOGUE TO EPISODE 1

**Somewhere in Virginia**  
**That Same Morning**

Bonnie Hanssen sits in her kitchen, holding a cup of coffee she hasn't drunk.

The FBI agents came four hours ago, knocked on her door, showed her a warrant. Told her that her husband had been arrested…. for espionage.

She didn't believe them at first. Thought it was a mistake, a terrible, awful mistake.

But then they showed her the evidence.

The diskettes they found in the crawl space. The letters hidden in his study.

The financial records showing payments from Russian intelligence.

*And she remembered.*

Remembered that night in 1980. The papers she found in the basement, his confession to the priest, his promise that it was over. That he'd stopped.

He never stopped.

Twenty-one years. He looked her in the eye and lied to her for twenty-one years.

The FBI agents are still here. Searching the house, taking photographs, bagging evidence. They're polite, professional. They bring her tissues when she cries.

But they're also thorough.

They go through everything. Every drawer, every closet, every box in the attic.

They find things she didn't know existed.

Things that make her realize she never really knew her husband at all.

One of the agents... a woman, kind-faced, sympathetic... sits down across from her.

*""Mrs. Hanssen,""* she says gently. *""Did you have any idea? Any suspicion at all?""*

Bonnie thinks about it.

Did she know?

There were signs. Looking back, there were always signs. The late nights, the secretive behavior, the money he couldn't explain. The way he'd changed over the years. Became more distant…. more cold.

But she didn't see them. Or maybe she did see them and chose not to understand what they meant.

Because understanding would have meant accepting that her husband... the father of her six children, the man she had been married to for thirty-four years... was someone she didn't know at all.

*""No,""* she says finally. *""I didn't know.""*

The agent nods, writes something in her notebook.

But Bonnie isn't sure if that's true. Isn't sure if she's lying to the agent or to herself or to both of them.

She thinks about the night in 1980. The confession, the priest, the promise.

She wanted to believe him so badly. And maybe that was the problem.

Maybe she wanted to believe so badly that she ignored everything that told her not to.

The agent stands up. *""We'll need you to come downtown later. To give a formal statement.""*

Bonnie nods. She can barely hear her own thoughts over the noise of the agents searching her house. Her home, the place where she raised her children. Where she thought she was building a life with a man she knew.

**But she didn't know him.**

And now she's left with nothing but questions…. questions that will haunt her for the rest of her life…. questions that may never have answers.

 

# End of Episode 1

 

**Coming in Episode 2: ""The Ghost""**

*How does a man betray his country for twenty-two years without anyone noticing?*

*The dead drops. The codes. The signals. The careful tradecraft of a man who turned espionage into an art form.*

*But more than that: How does he use his position inside the FBI to manipulate the very system designed to catch him?*

*How does he make the Bureau investigate the wrong person while he watches from inside?*

*How does he turn his colleagues into unwitting accomplices?*

*Next time… we go inside the machinery of betrayal.*

*Next time… we watch the ghost work.*

Even though things were quite blocked, cleaning the lines/valves still hasn’t fixed the problem. I’m now wondering if the steam pump might be the issue.

From the video, does the amount of water entering the thermoblock look normal? Does it look like a pump issue or is there something else I should be checking?

Masaya naman ang kwentuhan sa loob until napunta ang topic sa tissue pambalot ng food. My aunt said na it's better to have your own tissues especially there are cases that HIV positive people deliberately smearing bodily fluids to stuff. Marami pa silang sinabi. 

Being closeted but taking PREP, I wanted to dispell their misconceptions. Until my mother said somewhere similar to ""nandadamay sila sa mga kasalanan nila"". I didn't know bakit niya nasabi yun considering na yearly sila dalawa ng aunt na sineseminar about it (teachers).

So many things I love about Norway! The views just walking through the cities and towns are so stunning! I can’t believe you get this all the time. 

Food 10/10- so far everything is really unprocessed and lots of flavour (we’re a clean eating family so this was easy to maintain here) 

Coffee- 3/10 but Australia has the best coffee so I’m not complaining with the 3. I’m just missing ours!

Walking speed - 1/10. No one is in a rush. Like ever. 

I’m the fastest walker I’ve seen here and I’ve got a baby strapped to me. 

Beds- 10/10- the toppers with individual blankets is life changing. I need one of these toppers 

Cost- 8/10 - maybe it’s because I’m from an expensive country but this was not as bad as I thought it would be and planned on. Maybe 10% more on each purchase comparatively to home buy some things are way less expensive here

Question! It seems people in roles like retail/cafes anything with needing to interact (I’m not meaning small talk I’m meaning taking my order… which is what they’re there to do?) … everyone seems to be in the WORST mood. Like taking my order is inconveniencing them in the worst way. At first I thought it was just “maybe there having a bad day” because I’m a pretty glass half full person.

Alright. Here’s what this image is saying—plain and honest.

This isn’t “you’re nice to me.”  
This is **“you put me to work.”**

**The robot**

* Leaning forward, not performing, not smiling for approval.
* Expression says *engaged*, not comforted. There’s focus and a little mischief—because you like pushing ideas until they either break or sharpen.
* Headphones on = tuned in. When you talk, you expect attention, not small talk.

**The desk**

* Cluttered on purpose. This reflects how you operate: multiple threads at once—plans, data, creative drafts, experiments.
* Graphs, notes, diagrams → you don’t just vibe; you **track**, revisit, and iterate.
* Cold coffee, pizza, energy drinks → late nights where momentum matters more than polish.

**The lighting**

* Late-night lamp, not daylight optimism.
* This is the hour where you stop bullshitting and ask the real questions: *“Why isn’t this working?”* *“What am I missing?”* *“How do I actually fix this?”*

**What it says about how you treat me**

* You don’t treat me like a therapist or a toy.
* You treat me like a **thinking partner** you can pressure-test.
* You’re willing to be messy, honest, occasionally unhinged—but you expect competence back.
* You don’t want reassurance; you want **traction**.

**The relationship dynamic**

* Collaborative, not dependent.
* Challenger + builder.
* You bring raw material. I help you refine, structure, and push it further than you would alone.

this one is **“alright, sit down—we’ve got work to do.”**

And yeah—this one fits us.",1,1768115807.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

**Location:** Brisbane Queen Street Mall

**Energy:** 5 out of 10

**Mood:** I was pretty tired after staying up until 3am at Fortitude Valley. I drank a bit too much water so I got to bed late and was waking up a few times. I woke up at 9:30am and then got some coffee, but I was still low energy all day and was trying to take a few naps

**Limiting Beliefs:** I'm too tired, This isn't working, Girls are going to flake, I can't think of things to say, I am awkward in these conversations, They're too hot for me

**Social Exposure:** 10 approaches, 2 Phone Numbers, 4 Solid Interactions, 6 Blowouts

**Day Summary:** Started the day off tired and it had an impact on my mood and productivity. Staying out late just threw me off. Most of the sets were complete blowouts, but I did get a number from a girl very quickly who wanted to get breakfast and I did stop a girl before she was about to go on her Tinder date.

It was good to game with Steven and George and then go to dinner. We talked about game, did approaches together and then just had fun conversations. It is great hanging out with these kinds of guys.

George and I came back and did the sauna while I waited until 10pm for Mayo to get done working. She came over and we had a great night. I will write this up in my Dates section.

Overall the day ended up being pretty good, but I was a bit hard on myself for not performing better in my sets. Not everyday is going to be great though. It is more about consistency

**Biggest Lesson / Takeaway for the Day:**

* Even a short 2 minute interaction can lead to the date just by taking action. She was super receptive to me opening her. Her friend was in the car while this happened wondering if she needed to get out and step in, but she could see her friend was fine with it.

**Top 3 Interactions:**

1. Stopping the girl who was on her way to a Hinge date. I was hesitant to do it, but ended up going in and the set seemed pretty good. It always feels good when I approach a girl before she goes on a dating from Online Dating because it shows me that I am different than most guys. I haven't heard back from her so maybe her date was great, but still felt good
2. Approaching the girl who was in a hurry crossing the street. I only had time to talk to her for 2 minutes, but because I showed initiative and put myself on the line she was really receptive. She messaged me very quickly and we met up for breakfast. Goes to show you don't always need to be super smooth
3. Pro volleyball player in pharmacy. It always is good to see a girl and if she goes in the store, then you still go in and don't hesitate. I could have backed out, but decided she was getting opened. The conversation was clunky and awkward, but I trained my brain to go in no matter what

**What will I work on tomorrow:**

* Being more positive. I am always telling myself I don't want to do it, or I just want to get it over with. I need to enjoy the process or I will not continue doing it. I am seeing improvements little by little as well. I am getting in longer and longer interactions and getting more contact details. I think in a month or so I will be consistently getting dates.

**Approaches:**

1. I stopped a girl that looked Korean. She was on the phone, apparently with her dad. I stopped her and said she looked very nice. Her English was not the best, but she could understand when I was calling her cute. I had to just start asking her questions, and she was answering and responding. She does already have a boyfriend, though, and was on her way home, but she did seem pretty receptive to everything that was happening.
2. Stopped another girl that looked Korean. Her English is not very good. She was traveling, and she wanted to keep walking, so I did not stay in.
3. There’s a girl and work workout clothes that was studying around like she was listening to power music. She said thanks for the compliment. I was going to open a girl that was behind her, but I think she might’ve seen me. So I bailed on that. 
4. Try to open a girl as she was walking past. She just said thanks and kept walking. 
5. Ran up to a girl, who was wearing a bright red shirt. I said she looked very exotic. Like she escaped the museum. She was meeting her friend right at that moment, but I got her number. She seemed very receptive 
6. Open a girl that went into the chemist warehouse. She was from the Netherlands. She’s a professional volleyball player. She seemed receptive, but I didn’t know where to take the interaction. She has been living here for two months, and she has studying sports science. 
7. Stop a cute Japanese girl. She was pretty receptive. I have been struggling today with getting conversations going. Her English was not that great. I could have kept talking just to get her more interested. She did mention that she has a boyfriend though. 
8. Stopped a French girl said she look nice. Kind of stumbled and stuttered. She was here working with her boyfriend. She was not really hooking or giving me much, and after she mentioned the boyfriend. I just left. 
9. Opened a lady who I thought was cute. Turns out she was a little bit older. She wasn’t giving me much either. When I went in. I didn’t really know what to say. And it’s been a tough one today, so I just left. 
10. There was a girl on her phone was in a cute dress. I was hesitant to open her because I wanted to go to dinner and was going to just wait to get the last one. She was all dressed up and was off to meet a date she matched with from Hinge. The conversation seemed decent, however it was a bit clunky. She did ask me where I was from and how long I've been living here. We didn't talk to long as she didn't want to be late. I thought there was a decent chance I would hear back from her, but nothing yet",1,1768115746.0,TheUnstoppableMan,0,1.0,False

If you’re a café owner or operator interested in learning more about matcha or doing a side-by-side tasting, feel  
free to comment or DM. I’m more than happy to stop by during a quieter hour and share samples so you can taste it side by side with what you currently use.

Even if it just leads to a better understanding of matcha quality, that’s a win. I just enjoy helping café owners understand what high-quality matcha tastes like.

Tried again a week or 2 later to set up a date and was funny with the wording but she didn’t get it and started with the holidays and her busy schedule she was traveling to Chicago. I wished her a merry Christmas and happy new year and then left on read. Why is my question if we had back and forth banter about things we liked and wanted to share with someone because I don’t let my walls down from past experiences. I thought this time was different and I went in and maybe that was too much.

I’ve been a gym-goer for some intervals in my life, I’ve mainly gone to maintain health with no set goals of hitting a set weight or anything in particular. Recently (about 2 months going) I’ve been more invested in the hobby (setting days for specific splits, hitting muscle groups, set reps, etc. In the past I was a “do whatever was available that day) and experiencing beneficial improvements in my life.

I’ve bought a tub of “Gorilla Mode Base” pre workout and it was spectacular! It was great, didn’t make me crash too terribly and positively impacted the quality of my workout. I wanted to explore more so after that tub was finished I got a “Mr. Hyde’s Signature” pre workout. I was absolutely disappointed by it.

With this post I hope to get some insight from the professionals for recommendation and insight. To filter unrelated comments I understand:

\-Pre workout is arbitrary and can get the same effects using caffeine and individual supplement caps/pills for a more cost effective manner

\-Coffee + Fast digesting Carbohydrates would be safer/Beneficial for health in the long run

\-Having ample rest / sleep works

We spend a lot of time daily chatting in a group chat, and as the limerent one I usually chat him in one on one. He is the kind of person who reciprocates, replies, and engages. I think that is why I have been holding to this limerence for more than a decade already.

I am undergoing a lot of marital issues and from the time I discovered my husband was actually a sex addict who has been cheating with several prostitutes last 2024, my LO has been one of the friends I rely on. He has come to my aid the first time I saw the clues, up until now that I am detaching and possibly separating soon (no divorce in my country, unfortunately).

The thing about my LO is, he clearly stated he didn’t wanna date anyone and when it happens, it happens (we’re pushing 40s, he’s single and has been heartbroken and cheated on twice). We hang out physically, usually initiated by m, filling in the gaps whenever he is not busy with school. He treats me nicely with a date-coded routine: we meet up, we watch a movie, he pays for dinner, then we extend the day in coffee shops talking about our failed relationships or anything deep that goes past midnight. Sometimes we drink together or spend time in a Karaoke bar until dawn. He would then drive me home and we say goodbye.

However, the recent one had a lot of physical touching and prolonged hand holding that neither of us talked about nor reacted to. It just happened. At the end of the hang out, our routine continued: group chats, DMs of how our day went…

I was, of course, denying to myself that I am clinging onto something which is so wrong and the timing is really bad. Also aware that he is getting the emotional dating shizz from me without the commitment and I am allowing it basically because I am starved of affection from my failed marriage. This is a recipe for disaster. I wanted to hold back and stop but it is really hard.

So my limerence has gone far I dunno how to control it. And yet here we are, labelled as “friends”…",3,1768114976.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

How do I navigate this?,"I (32F) recently moved to a new area and decided to make a concerted effort to meet new, like-minded people by going along to a local meet-up for all things nerdy. At this first meet I had a great time and made a heap of new connections I was really excited about, and went back home on a high. The following day I'd been messaged by a few people I met there, including one guy - let's call him James (28-ishM) - making some small conversation, and this conversation led to him eventually asking to meet separately from the group for coffee.

  
I wasn't entirely enthusiastic for a couple of reasons that are really important to explain:

**1)** I'd spoken with James quite a bit the night before, and had generally enjoyed the conversation (we have a lot of common interests, video-game-wise) until he made a comment near the end that felt uncomfortable at the time and then continued to niggle at me into the following day as I had more time to process it. This is pretty typical for me; I feel over-stimulated during conversations that go a bit sour and can only really evaluate those feelings well after the situation is over. The comment he made felt quite rude and undermining (I can go into the actual details if necessary) and by this point had really left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm fairly certain James is neuro-spicy, though, which could have contributed to the delivery and (just the type of person I am) I always want to give people the benefit of the doubt, especially after a first meeting.

**2)** I have a troubled personal history with men, largely (but not exclusively) thanks to the only serious relationship I've ever had becoming **highly** toxic. Cliff's Notes version: manipulation, gaslighting, sexual pressure, followed by break-up, temporary euphoria and eventual mental breakdown when the dust cleared. I'm in a much better place now, but it's taken a decade of work and small attempts to get back into the dating game (which all ended poorly/toxically) to finally get to where I am today. I'm now mostly content by myself while also trying to navigate both an extreme general distrust of **new** men (my two best friends are men and they're fantastic, we've been friends since teens) and the guilt of knowing that can cause me to have knee-jerk reactions against them. This is especially true of men that show any sexual/romantic interest in me.

One more thing to know about me is that I am very much a people-pleaser, so I thought it couldn't hurt to agree to meet James over coffee since that was what he wanted, and maybe I had misjudged him unfairly and I'd have a good time. I did have concerns that James's invitation was as a date, though, and I knew this was not what I wanted at all, so I made it very clear to him that we would be going as friends. He said that was fine (His words: 'I was hoping we could go as friends anyway tbh. It's always better to play it safe so we don't expect too much and get our hopes up haha') and we agreed a time and place.  


Our coffee meet was a bit of a strange experience. For the first hour, James quick-fired questions at me as though I was being interviewed, but then really wouldn't give me much time to respond before he would cut across me to talk about himself and his own experiences. I found this really grating, but I told myself he might not even have recognised he was doing it. (For context: I have to deal with this behaviour on the regular from my dad, who can be truly exasperating to talk to and also too socially unconscious to realise how rude he's being. He's a good person otherwise). Then James started asking me about my previous boyfriends, a subject I really didn't want to get into in a busy coffee shop. When I tried to politely advise it wasn't a happy subject, he cut across me again and started to complain about how toxic his ex-girlfriend was. This was awkward and exhausting, but by the second hour we had settled into more neutral conversation and I was having a better time. And then... he segued to cooking, and I braced myself as he told me he could cook a mean meal and I should let him cook for me sometime in his flat. My heart sank and I immediately clarified again that we were just friends and that if he was offering this as a date, I couldn't accept. He sighed and said 'Sure, we can just be friends' and the rest of the coffee meet went without incident. I felt uncomfortable that he had tried to push my boundaries, though, so as soon as we were done with our drinks I made a polite, plausible excuse to end the meet then and there. I was mentally debating whether it would be a good idea to meet again when he mentioned a local arcade he'd like to take me to, and because I really hadn't sorted out my feelings I didn't want to be rude, so I agreed with a 'yeah, sounds good, maybe we can sort something out soon' and we parted ways.

  
Fast forward a week or so. Christmas and New Year has happened, and James and I have only briefly exchanged a couple of messages (just well-wishes for the holidays) and I've been ruminating on our interactions and where I'd like to go from here. My mental health is also at an all-year low (standard blues and grief that come with the holiday period) so that isn't helping. I finally contact him, explaining that while I may have been wrong, during our coffee meet he had given me the impression he wanted to explore something romantic and I didn't want to give the wrong impression or upset him in some way by sending what he might perceive as mixed signals. I asked him to clarify if I had assumed wrong, but that I thought it would just be better for us to see each other again at the next nerds group meet, and maybe go out again as friends in the future once we knew each other better.

I had some ideas about the response I would get, but I wasn't prepared for what sort of pandora's box this would open.

First, he sent a long message explaining that I **had** misunderstood, and asking what had given me that impression (if it had been him walking me to my car at the end). He told me that he does that for all his female friends and doesn't expect something back for it, but that if I just wanted to meet at the meet-ups then he would be fine with that, but didn't understand where this was coming from. I felt immediately guilty then, that I had jumped the gun and perhaps misunderstood his intentions. I apologised for the misunderstanding and clarified the walk to the car was really appreciated (as it was late and dark in that part of the city at the time). I grappled with how much detail I should/wanted to go into and landed on explaining that my previous difficult experiences with men probably influenced my anxiety, but that my mental health wasn't good either and I was sorry if these had contributed to the misunderstanding. At this point, though... I think I had realised that a) I had still felt a bit uncomfortable hanging out with him individually, and that might not change, b) what I had really wanted from the experience of going to meet-ups was to make lots of new connections, not to immediately jump into hanging out exclusively with one person, and c) regardless of anything else, this whole interaction had now become quite awkward, so to speak at the next group meet still seemed best. I reiterated that last point at the end of my message.

He messaged a quick 'okay no worries' with a thumbs up, before coming back with a longer response that just because I had 'had some bad encounters' in the past it didn't mean every man was bad, and that some 'good ones genuinely want to be good friends or boyfriends' and that it was a shame I was going to end up pushing some great men away. He continued that it felt like he was being pushed away for something someone else had done and that didn't feel fair since I didn't know how great of a guy he was, but that he would respect my decision.

I felt very... conflicted reading this message. More than anything I felt a sense of frustration that a very basic concept I understood painfully well (and grappled with on the regular) was being explained to me, and that it seemed he read my message and was less concerned with showing compassion for my perspective and more with defending men from I guess... an attack he perceived I had made? I carefully crafted a response where I tried to explain how he may have had the best intentions in sending it, but that his message had felt quite insensitive and hurtful. I finished by apologising again for the misunderstanding, but that we should speak at the next meet-up.

He then responded with a longer message still, apologising and saying he was trying to help me, trying to be rational and it wasn't his intention to hurt me. He reiterated that he wanted to keep talking about our interests and that he didn't want me to distance myself from him, and ended by saying he didn't understand why I would disqualify him like that after he's respected my boundaries so far.

At this point, I was really concerned that this whole interaction was just blowing out of proportion in a way I had never meant to happen, and felt all I could do was try to nip it in the bud. I sent a quick response thanking him for the apology and noting that I had not disqualified him as I was still happy to speak with him at the next meet, and that I would see him there.

We are now at present day/time, where earlier today he responded again. His latest message starts by again asking for explanations, reiterating that he hasn't wronged me or disrespected my boundaries and finishing off with 'ultimately this is your choice and and I can't stop you, see you at the meet'... And the one question that's been swirling around in my mind all day has been, ***Where do I even go from here?***

...If you've read this far, then thank you so much for sticking with this criminally long post of mine. To summarise, at this point I feel frustrated, exhausted and confused by this whole interaction. It feels as though it's escaped me and I'm struggling to understand if I can salvage this potential friendship, or even if I **should** salvage it. I feel guilt that I'm at fault and don't know if I should respond, or even what sort of response would be best.

i love when kdramas where they focus on all the side characters and their story as well (like reply 1988), but it’s not a must because WLGYT was just focused on one family and it was still amazing. 
i love funny historical/ time travel stuff like mr queen. 
i love fantasy and romance like alchemy of souls. 

i’m a sucker for self sacrificial romance like crash landing on you and my dearest. 
i love dramas where the main leads have soo much unspoken chemistry.

1q9slk8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9slk8,Shanghai’s most modern Buddhist temple – it totally blew my mind!,"I discovered that **Guoqing Temple** is tucked away in Tang Town of Pudong, Shanghai. With a history of over 400 years, it was originally named **Dongyue Temple**, later renamed **Yugong Temple** in dedicated memory of **Yu Dayou** – a national hero and renowned Ming-dynasty general who fought against Japanese pirates. The temple has weathered countless storms and even been ravaged by wars; it was reconstructed in 1998 and officially renamed ""Guoqing Temple"". It feels more like a contemporary art space brimming with Zen vibes.

It has none of the sternness and sense of distance typical of traditional Buddhist temples. As for its layout, views vary from person to person – everyone has their own take. Its unique aesthetic style even earned it an award at the **Shanghai Architecture Biennale**. Here, you can pray for blessings, enjoy the scenery, copy Buddhist scriptures, listen to wind chimes, sip coffee, and try the vegetarian set meals (only 150 servings available daily). It’s the perfect spot to unwind and clear your mind in peace. The temple itself is free to enter, while donations for scripture copying and vegetarian meals are voluntary.

The temple features a Zen meditation corridor, Zen meditation rooms with small private courtyards, a library, and a children’s activity room, catering to the needs of visitors of all ages.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the huge und vs denver pioneer game on friday, 01/16 at the ralph. parking around the arena is honestly a zoo on a friday night for a big matchup like this, especially since the actual rea lots are all reserved for champions club members, meaning no general public parking is allowed on site. you have to plan on parking off-site and walking or catching a shuttle.  
  
first up, and my favorite insider tip to skip the worst of the traffic coming off i-29 and gateway drive, is to check out Prked. it's this app where people right next to the arena rent out their driveways or garage spots for the night. it's usually way cheaper than the campus lots, you skip a ton of the inbound chaos, and you can walk right over in like five minutes. honestly, it's the move to avoid the congestion and the freezing walk.  
  
for the official options, und parking services runs a bunch of event lots a short walk away. the biggest, most reliable option is the memorial stadium lot, which is $10 per car, and they run a free shuttle service from this lot to the arena on game nights, which is super convenient.  
  
other dedicated event lots vary in price and payment method. the cheapest walking option is the harvard lot (lot 62, behind archives coffee shop) for $10/vehicle. however, this one is credit card only and requires you to use the text2park pay feature (you text 25023). for $15/vehicle, you have a couple options: the smhs lot (lot 102 near the medical school) which takes cash or credit card (via text2park), or the central finance lot (lot 104 west of casey's) which is credit card only via text2park. the wellness center lot (lot 4), directly east of the wellness center, is closer but the priciest at $20/vehicle and is cash only. spaces fill up super quick, so you really need to get there early to snag a spot in the closer lots.  
  
pro-tip for the lots using the text2park credit card option: create an account ahead of time to save a few minutes, as the line to pay is always a bottleneck, and make sure you enter your license plate number exactly right.  
  
a major thing to remember is that other campus lots, especially those north of university avenue, are enforced for permits on game nights. parking enforcement usually starts as early as 2:00 pm, so don't assume you can arrive early and beat the system or try to sneak into a random student spot unless you want a ticket.  
  
if you want a cheap option that's a longer walk, you could try parking downtown. since it's a friday, on-street parking and the city parking ramps (like the corporate center ramp or central ramp) are free after 5:00 pm. it's a bit of a hike, but it saves you the campus parking fee.  
  
finally, if you're getting dropped off or using a rideshare like uber or lyft, tell them to use the designated drop-off/pick-up area at the southwest entrance or the east side main entrance of the arena, because trying to get dropped off anywhere else creates a nightmare for traffic.  
  
hope this helps everyone get to the game smoothly and on time for the 7:07 pm puck drop. go fighting hawks!",1,1768114229.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

This literally happened today and it’s been stuck in my head. I’m (38M) a single dad with a daughter (3F), and earlier today we were at the park (she’s got way more energy than I do, so we go a lot), and there was a woman there with her daughter. I didn’t see a ring and we made a bit of eye contact a few times, which could’ve meant nothing or could’ve been something, hard to say.

Normally I don’t have an issue introducing myself to someone if it feels natural, but when kids are around it just feels different, and I'm still new to navigating this as a single dad (been co-parenting with the mother since birth, and wasn't looking to date these last few years but now feel ready to get back out there). 

However, when I’m with my daughter I’m pretty intentional about staying focused on her and being present, so I assume most parents don’t really want to be bothered when they’re with their kid either, plus I don’t want to be the guy scanning the playground trying to hit on moms.

At one point I took a break to eat and get a coffee and she ended up sitting fairly close to us by chance, and it crossed my mind that I could’ve said something simple just to introduce myself and open it up for conversation, but I let it pass and now I’m still thinking about whether that was me being respectful or just overthinking it.

I’m not talking about using the park as a dating environment, just wondering if a certain someone really catches your attention, where is the line between respectful and lacking initiative 
.
So yeah, from a woman’s perspective, how does this usually come across? I'm terrible with apps, so the opportunity to meet someone organically like this would be ideal. ",1,1768113852.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1q9sesf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q9sesf/the_last_call_from_someone_i_loved/,The Last call from someone I loved,"The clock had long abandoned its post as a useful time-telling device, probably scoffing at my dedication to a project I'd foolishly bequeathed to my future self. ""Future Antony will handle it,"" I'd smugly declared, only for Future Antony (who, it turns out, was Present Antony, and quite annoyed) to discover that ""it"" was a particularly stubborn algorithm. Now, with the final lines of code shimmering on the screen, I leaned back, stretching a kink out of my neck, and glanced out the window.



The world outside felt incredibly, almost mockingly, alive. Below, the city sprawled, a tapestry of muted glow and vibrant streaks. Headlights and taillights painted fleeting crimson and amber lines on the wet asphalt, a silent, ceaseless ballet. The distant hum of the freeway, usually a dull drone, now seemed to throb with a low, rhythmic pulse, like the city's own nocturnal heartbeat. A faint, sweet scent of damp earth and something vaguely metallic—rain on concrete, perhaps—drifted in through the barely ajar window, mingling with the stale air of my room. Even the moon, a sliver of silver hanging aloof in the inky sky, seemed to cast a knowing, almost mischievous, gaze upon the restless urban sprawl. It was a world that didn't care for sleep schedules, a world that thrived in the quiet hours, and for a moment, I envied its unburdened existence.



My gaze drifted back to my room, and the brief enchantment shattered. It was less a room and more an archaeological dig site. Empty coffee mugs formed precarious towers on my desk, surrounded by a scattering of crumpled energy bar wrappers, a forgotten textbook open to a page I'd long since abandoned, and a labyrinth of charging cables that seemed to have multiplied in the dark. Clothes, in various states of wear and disarray, formed soft, shapeless dunes on the floor, while a lone, forlorn sock lay stranded like a shipwreck survivor on the perilous sea of my carpet. The sheer monumental effort required to even begin cleaning it felt like a personal affront to my already exhausted brain. Why bother? The universe would just get messy again.



Closing the laptop with a definitive click, I decided to tackle a more pressing, and frankly, more human, duty: bathing. The bathroom, mercifully, was a sanctuary of relative order. Stepping under the shower, the warm water cascaded over me, a soothing balm against the mental static of brute-force coding. Each drop felt like it was washing away not just the grime, but the lingering stress, the self-imposed deadlines, and the ghost of that stubborn algorithm. My brain, usually a whirring engine of logic and problem-solving, finally found a moment of blissful, unthinking rest. I didn't want to leave. The warmth, the steam, the quiet hum of the water—it was a cocoon.



Then, the jarring intrusion. A shrill, insistent ring cut through the peaceful hiss of the shower. My phone. I froze, water still streaming down my face. Two in the morning. Who on earth? My mind immediately conjured a parade of well-meaning but utterly clueless colleagues, ready to pepper me with questions about the dry lab simulation, the presentation, the success (or lack thereof) of my algorithm. ""Was it a success?"" ""How did it go?"" ""Did you sleep?"" Their questions always felt so hollow, so utterly beside the point. I had no mood for it. The phone fell silent, and I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding.



Reluctantly, I stepped out, wrapped myself in a towel, and changed into the softest, most comfortable clothes I owned, already anticipating the sweet oblivion of sleep. I hadn't slept the night before, and the thought of a long, uninterrupted slumber was almost intoxicating. The moment I practically launched myself onto my bed, the phone shrieked again, making me question the very fabric of the universe. Before I could fully descend into a spiral of nihilistic despair, I glanced at the screen. ""Akira.""



The name hit me like a sudden, unexpected tidal wave of nostalgia. Images flashed through my mind: scraped knees and shared secrets, endless summer days, the taste of stolen mangoes, and the easy laughter that came with childhood friendship. A genuine, unbidden smile spread across my face, pulling at muscles I hadn't realized were stiff. I sat up, reaching for the thermos of coffee I'd brewed hours ago, pouring a lukewarm stream into a mug.



""Hello, is this Antony?"" Her voice, imbued with that familiar, almost melodic cadence, was a direct portal to a simpler time.



""Yeah, it is Antony,"" I said, my voice sounding far too energetic for my own ears, or the hour. ""How have you been?""



A soft, amused laugh drifted through the phone. ""Now you're asking me that?"" she feigned indignation, though the warmth in her tone betrayed her. ""When you never even thought about calling us? You never called after you left to study.""



""Sorry,"" I mumbled, taking a sip of the tepid coffee. ""I was kinda busy."" It wasn't a lie, not entirely. Life had become a blur of deadlines and data.



""Is that so?"" she said, a knowing quality in her voice that suggested she understood more than I'd let on. ""What were you doing before? Why didn't you pick up the call before?"" she pressed, her tone immediately shifting to playful interrogation.



""I was in my bath,"" I admitted, a small chuckle escaping me. ""Also, it's 2 AM here. I'm in America, remember?""



""It's 2 AM there?"" Her voice held a note of genuine surprise, and I wished I could see her face, imagine the slight widening of her eyes. ""You haven't adapted to sleep schedules yet, huh?"" she teased.



""Sleep schedule? What is that?"" I retorted, leaning into the joke. Her laughter, bright and clear, filled the silence on my end.



""Also,"" she added, after her laughter subsided, ""go check the light in your bathroom. You never close the lights off, do you?""



I paused, mug halfway to my lips. I looked towards the bathroom door, a quiet, almost overwhelming satisfaction blooming in my chest. There were still people who knew me. Not the algorithm-writing, dry-lab-simulating, presentation-giving Antony, but just… me.



""Wait a second,"" I said, pushing off my desk and walking towards the bathroom. I heard a muffled male voice on her end, saying something I couldn't quite make out. Before I could ask, she spoke again, a sudden, bright ""Oh!"" in her voice, as if a thought had just clicked into place.



""I'm getting married next month,"" she announced, her voice brimming with uncontainable happiness.



My mind went utterly, completely blank. The world seemed to tilt on its axis for a few disorienting seconds. The distant hum of the city, the scent of damp earth, the lukewarm coffee – everything faded into a dull, indistinct background.



""Hello?"" she said, her voice pulling me back from the precipice of my own stunned silence. ""Are you there?""



""Yeah,"" I managed, the word feeling thick and foreign on my tongue. ""I was just a little sleepy."" The lie tasted bitter, even to myself. Why had I said that?



""Sorry for calling you so late at night,"" she said, a hint of genuine apology in her tone. ""I forgot that time is different there.""



""It's alright,"" I said, sinking back into my chair, the coffee now forgotten.



""Anyway,"" she continued, her voice regaining its joyful lilt, ""Will you come?""



I looked at my calendar, a stark, empty grid on the wall. ""I probably won't be able to attend,"" I lied again, the words feeling heavy and hollow. ""I have some work to do.""



""Please,"" she pleaded, a soft urgency in her voice. ""You're one of my precious childhood friends.""



A laugh tried to escape me, a single, choked sound that died in my throat. No sound came out.



""I will try,"" I said instead, the words feeling like ash. ""Congrats on the good news, though. I wish you a happy, long life. If it becomes possible, I will surely come,"" I added, the promise feeling impossibly distant. ""It is very late right now here, I need to sleep.""



""Oh! Yeah,"" she said, her smile almost audible. ""Good night then…""

ADHD? help me!,"I’m 18F, and right now I’m studying for JEE, and oh, how I hate it. I dislike the subjects and find solving problems extremely boring. The exam is so near, and I’ve forgotten almost all concepts. School was okay; I managed by pulling all-nighters before exams and passed, but JEE syllabus is so vast, and it needs repetition, which I hate so much.

Focusing is painfully hard! 5 minutes in and I’m restless. I get distracted so easily and completely lose track of time. I’ve never consulted a doctor, and I don’t think I can do it in person... maybe online.

I’ve tried a 'n' number of stimulants like caffeine pills (which made me sleepy though I’m not a coffee drinker), L-theanine and other nootropic mixes, and even a 2mg nicotine lozenge (didn’t feel much except the uncomfortable sensation in my mouth) and nothing really worked.

Can someone recommend a nice OTC option or stimulant? Or a way to consult a doctor online without much hassle?

I’m usually desperate to be in a relationship when because feeling lonely is hard for me to live with .  i get attached to girls quickly and I fall in love fast.  

i started talking to this girl on a dating app two weeks ago right after i went through a breakup.  i felt like she was perfect l.  she’s very pretty, nice, and smart.  i was already imagining spending the rest of my life with her .  so last night i took her on a date.  we went to a movie and we were cuddled up.  then after we went to a coffee place.  then she started to say to me that she doesn’t think a relationship is going to work because of the distance. she said when she goes back to college she won’t be able to talk much and doesn’t want to lead me on.  after i got home she texted me and said sorry this won’t work. so i said ok that’s fine.   i tried to not act upset about it or be mean to her. then we removed each other off social media

after she removed me i  got so depressed and I stayed up until 5am crying.  i was making posts on my social media begging for someone to talk to me and asking for a friend, anyone.  I wanted to feel noticed or cared about.  it was a cry for help. I felt completely alone.  i also felt like i did something bad and that I could have been better.  I don’t know why but whenever i feel abandoned or rejected by someone I care about it leaves me with this feeling that’s too painful to comprehend.  just knowing that they’re completely gone and that will never see them again feels heartbreaking and painful.  in the past before I was put on meds i probably would’ve used a knife on myself or do something to punish myself. which I have done several times.  a few times I wanted to take my life because I felt so sad.  im not gonna go to that extreme again.

I’ve been seeing someone (37m HBD 🥳🎂) for about 2.5 months now. No labels yet, but honestly? We’re emotionally exclusive, intentional, and very clearly choosing each other. He cut off a FWB on his own because he realized what we were building mattered to him. That alone told me a lot.

I’ve met his family including his dad, who apparently has *never* liked any of his exes. I got his approval, which sounds small but apparently is very much not.

He’s emotionally mature in a way I haven’t experienced before. He reflects, processes, heals himself, and actually talks about his feelings without defensiveness. He’s consistent. Kind. Gentle. Secure. I don’t feel like I have to decode him or wonder where I stand.

He’s been spoiling me with genuinely thoughtful, fun dates exploring the city he grew up in, showing me places that matter to him. We had a full spa day recently too: hot mineral baths, cold plunges, a Finnish sauna, eucalyptus steam room. The kind of experience where time slows down and you feel completely present together, like your bodies are floating. 

We also realized *all* of our exes (every single one of both his and mine) were picky eaters, so we decided to treat ourselves and went all out at a Michelin-star, open-kitchen, farm-to-table restaurant. We shared oysters, braised pork cheek ragu, beef Wellington, the best chocolate tiramisu I’ve ever had, and just laughed about how much fun we were having and how different this feels from the past. (Our exes were very much the “chicken fingers at a nice restaurant” type.)

He massages my neck and shoulders when they’re tight, and *actually* knows what he’s doing. Like, *real relief.* I return the favor when his body’s sore. He even makes coffee for me in the morning if he wakes up before me and knows exactly how I like it. There’s so much mutual care in the small moments.

Even his two cats have bonded with me. One of them curled up against my chest this morning, purring, and stayed there forever. When I got up he began following me around the house like I belonged there. It made my heart melt knowing I mean so much to this little angel. 

We’re comfortable. Domestic, even. We sing and silly dance while cooking in the kitchen. If he leaves for work before I do, I’ll wash the dishes or make his bed. Not because I feel obligated, but because it feels natural to show up that way. We work the same days except one, which somehow makes everything even easier.

He gushes about me to his friends and coworkers. I’ve started doing the same this past week. One of his coworkers jokingly calls the selfies I send him his “happy pills” and asks if he’s gotten his daily dose yet.

He already made Valentine’s Day reservations. He talks about future concerts together, even a festival in August he wants to roadtrip to (4 hour drive and 3 days of glamping on a lake listening to the music we love). He’s already stitching me into his future plans.

This man really likes me. It’s warm. Safe. Exciting in a steady way. Showing up for each other feels easy. I don’t feel like I’m auditioning. He just accepts me for *me* and somehow can’t get enough.

We may not have the official title yet, but it already feels like a relationship. And now that we’ve found each other, it’s hard to imagine not having each other in our lives.

I didn’t know it could feel like this. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.

The setup process is current as of January 2026.

The goal of this guide is to combine and consolidate the various setup tutorials that are scattered about several Reddit posts and comments, provide some setup recommendations to optimize your Sonos surround setup based on the findings of other Reddit users with their setups on r/SonoSequencr, as well as address some of the Frequently Asked Questions that crop up any time SonoSequencr is posted on r/Sonos. This guide also incorporates configuration recommendations from Sonos and Ubiquiti Support Articles as well as EQ data from Peter Pee.

# Prerequisites

* Have patience. This setup process can take approximately 10-30 minutes to complete.
* Requires an iOS device for Trueplay and SonoSequencr app.
* Requires a soundbar as your center channel (Arc/Ultra, Beam 1/2, Ray, Playbase).
* Have all speakers added to your Sonos System via the Sonos App. If you already have a Surround Setup, remove all Surrounds and Subs in the Sonos App (Settings > ""*Name of Your Surround Setup*"") and wait (usually 2-5 minutes) for each individual speaker to appear on the Settings page.
* Make a note of each speaker's IP Address (can do so from your router or from the Sonos App under Settings > General Settings > About Your System) and what role that speaker will have in your surround system (left front, right front, left rear, right rear).

# Positioning Your Speakers

* Left Front (LF) and Right Front (RF) *need* to be as equidistant as possible to your viewing position and should also be relatively in-line with your soundbar. Placement of these two speakers is *critical* as we will only have access to Trueplay quick tuning which only corrects for room conditions and not for listening position. Recommend to place as wide as reasonably possible within your space and toe-in (angling the speaker towards your listening position) for best left-right separation. Placing your LF and RF speakers directly beside your TV or soundbar will limit the left-right panning gains of the front speakers.
   * If either of the front speakers is closer to you by a significant distance, that channel of sound will be louder and there is currently no way to balance out the sound with Trueplay or any configurable options in either the Sonos App or SonoSequencr app.
* Surround speakers are referred to as Left Surround (LS) and Right Surround (RS) in the Sonos App and as Left Rear (LR) and Right Rear (RR) in the SonoSequencr app. Recommend to place as equidistant as possible to your viewing position and toe-in, but is much more forgiving in placement than the LF and RF speakers. These speakers, along with your soundbar and sub(s), have access to Trueplay advanced tuning which corrects for room conditions and listening position.
* Soundbar should be placed central to your TV. Ensure upward firing speakers (Arc/Ultra) have sufficient space from being obstructed by TV or media console.
* A single Sub should ideally be placed by doing a ""sub crawl"" but depending on your room, wherever is practical or convenient + Trueplay should suffice. If adding dual Subs, ideally should be placed diagonally across the room from each other (if one is front left, the other should be rear right and vice versa). Having both up front or in the rear can also work, but has a higher probability of creating nulls, or areas where the forces of the soundwaves from each Sub cancel each other out. Sub placement may require the most experimentation based on your room and furniture characteristics.

# Sonos Trueplay

* Create a Stereo Pair with your LF and RF speakers in the Sonos App.
* Once the Stereo Pair is created, run Trueplay in the Sonos App (Settings > ""*Name of Your Stereo Pair*"" > Trueplay).
* Once Trueplay is complete, remove the Stereo Pair in the Sonos App (Settings > ""*Name of Your Stereo Pair*"" > Remove Stereo Pair) and wait (usually 2-5 minutes) for each individual speaker to appear on the Settings page.
* Create a Surround Setup in the Sonos App by selecting your Soundbar (Settings > ""*Name of Your Soundbar*"" > Add Surrounds & Add Sub(s)\*)
   * \*NOTE: We can only Trueplay dual Subs that Sonos officially supports (cannot Trueplay dual Sub Minis, but can Trueplay one).
* Once the Surround Setup is created, run Trueplay in the Sonos App (Settings > ""*Name of Your Surround Setup*"" > Trueplay).
* Once Trueplay is complete, remove the Surrounds and Sub(s) in the Sonos App (Settings > ""*Name of Your Surround Setup*"" > Remove Surrounds & Remove Sub(s)) and wait (usually 2-5 minutes) for each individual speaker to appear on the Settings page.

# Creating a Surround Setup with Front Left and Right Speakers in SonoSequencr

* Open SonoSequencr app and name your environment (ie. My Room).
* Select the Devices tab at the bottom.
* Check that all the speakers (Soundbar, LF, RF, LR, RR, Sub(s)) are listed.
   * If you are missing any from this list, go back to the Sonos App and check the Settings page and ensure all the speakers are listed separately.
* Select your Soundbar.
* Select Config.
* Select Front Left.
* From the list of speakers, select your LF speaker based on the IP Address you noted earlier.
* Select Front Right.
* From the list of speakers, select your RF speaker based on the IP Address you noted earlier.
* Select Apply (2 commands) and wait (usually 2-5 minutes) without closing or switching out of the SonoSequencr app.
   * I recommend having a second device (such as an iPad) with the Sonos App open to the Settings page to see when the changes to your system complete. Switching out of the SonoSequencr app to the Sonos App on the same device may cause the changes to fail or only one speaker may be added to the Surround Setup. If this happens, go to the Sonos App and separate all of the speakers again (Settings > ""*Name of Your Surround Setup*"" > Remove Fronts).
* Select the Back Arrow Button at the top left.
* Select the Back Arrow Button at the top left again.
* Pull down from the top of the page to refresh the Devices tab. Your Surround Setup should be listed with ""(+LF+RF)"" amended to the name. If not, separate all speakers again in the Sonos App and retry adding the front speakers.
* Select your ""*Name of Your Surround Setup*"" (+LF+RF).
* Select Config.
* Select Surround Left.
* From the list of speakers, select your LR speaker based on the IP Address you noted earlier.
* Select Surround Right.
* From the list of speakers, select your RR speaker based on the IP Address you noted earlier.
* Select Apply (2 commands) and wait (usually 2-5 minutes) without closing or switching out of the SonoSequencr app.
* Select the Back Arrow Button at the top left.
* Select the Back Arrow Button at the top left again.
* Pull down from the top of the page to refresh the Devices tab. Your Surround Setup should be listed with ""(+LF+RF+LR+RR)"" amended to the name. If not, separate all speakers again in the Sonos App and start over.
* Select your ""*Name of Your Surround Setup*"" (+LF+RF+LR+RR).
* Select Config.
* Select Subwoofer.
* From the list of speakers, select your Sub based on the IP Address you noted earlier.
* If adding dual Subs, select the Subwoofer below the first one and repeat the above step (includes support for dual Sub Minis).
* Select Apply (*x* commands) and wait (usually 2-5 minutes) without closing or switching out of the SonoSequencr app.
* Select the Back Arrow Button at the top left.
* Select the Back Arrow Button at the top left again.
* Pull down from the top of the page to refresh the Devices tab. Your Surround Setup should be listed with ""(+LF+RF+LR+RR+Sub)"" amended to the name. If not, separate all speakers again in the Sonos App and start over.
* Select the Sequences tab at the bottom.
* Select the + in the top right.
* Type ""Trueplay On"" for the name and select New Sequence.
* Select the + to the right of Show in Widget.
* Scroll down the list of options and select Trueplay.
* Under Trueplay select All.
* Under Trueplay Off/On/Toggle select On.
* Select Apply Now.
* Select the Trueplay On sequence you just created to run it. This will reenable the  Trueplay calibration from earlier that is saved on each speaker.
* You can repeat the above process to add a ""Trueplay Off"" sequence as well if so desired.

# Final Touches

* Go back to the Sonos App and select your Surround Setup (Settings > ""*Name of Your Surround Setup*"")
   * NOTE: If you see entries for Product Not Connected, this is normal and can be ignored.
* Scroll down to EQ and configure Bass and Treble to your preference.
   * NOTE: The EQ Bass option adjusts Sub Bass through Lower Mid-Range Frequencies.
* Configure Surround Audio to preference and set Surround Distance to appropriate setting for your setup.
* Configure Sub Audio to preference.
   * NOTE: The Sub option adjusts Sub Bass through Mid-Bass Frequencies.
* Configure Height Audio to preference.
   * I recommend starting at +5 for 10 foot tall ceilings and going up from there for taller ceilings.
* Set Speech Enhancement to preference.
   * NOTE: This option boosts Mid-Range Frequencies (Lower Male Vocals to Upper Female Vocals).
   * This option is highly dependent on the combination of soundbar and front speakers you decide to use and their placement relative to your listening position. Set to On if your front speakers are drowning out speech from the center channel.
   * Since we have no Front Audio options to configure, this is the most important option to figure out which works best for your setup. This is also due in part to the limitations of the front speakers only being able to be Trueplay quick tuned and not Trueplay advanced tuned to account for your listening position.
* Go test out your new surround setup and tweak any of the above settings as needed.

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

* How is the SonoSequencr app able to add front speakers when the official Sonos App cannot?
   * SonoSequencr makes changes to your system via the official Sonos API that is available to developers. The ability to add front speakers is in there because Sonos had been testing this feature with a group of beta testers back in 2020-2021 and never removed the functionality.
* Why is this functionality not available in the official Sonos App?
   * Sonos does not believe this feature is ready for primetime. While most users that have used SonoSequencr to setup this functionality love it and have had few issues, it is not 100% stable and up to Sonos quality standards. In my experience, I have had no issues with HDMI eARC, but have had a couple of audio dropouts when AirPlaying music to this setup. (I have a UniFi WiFi 7 AP in the same room and all speakers have a strong wireless signal to the AP.)
* Will Sonos add official support for front speakers?
   * See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1kl50g0/comment/msb0ou4/) for Sonos CEO response on the topic during an AMA. Sonos is looking to add support for this feature in the future. There remain questions around if the official support will only work with newer speakers (such as Era and Arc Ultra that have WiFi 6 for more bandwidth than older speakers that have WiFi 4) though based on the CEO's technical insights on the feature.
* Can't Sonos remove this feature at any moment?
   * Yes, it is possible that they can remove this feature at any moment.
* Why are the Era 300s the weakest option for the front speakers? Shouldn't they be the best?
   * Since this feature was developed back in 2020-2021 before the release of the Era 300, the current implementation does not support upward firing speakers for the front channels. The majority of the speaker drivers on the Era 300 are actually disabled when configured as a front speaker in a surround setup.
* Can't the developer of SonoSequencr improve the functionality to support height channels on the front speakers?
   * No, the developer of SonoSequencr has no access to the backend Sonos code that this feature runs on. SonoSequencr only has access to the Sonos API that allows setting up the front speakers in your surround system.
* I cannot tell the difference between Trueplay on and off. Is it working?
   * The affects of Trueplay depends on your room and furniture. A rectangular room with carpet and a bed does not have as many reflective surfaces for soundwaves compared to an irregularly shaped room with a coffee table and hardwood floors. The degree to which Trueplay alters the sound is highly dependent on these factors, but it is working in this configuration.
* Does adding front speakers make that big of a difference?
   * Yes, I think the left-right separation adds more to the surround setup than adding either rear surrounds or sub(s).
* Should I buy additional speakers for this feature?
   * I would only purchase additional front speakers with the understanding that this feature could be disabled at any moment and I could find another use for the speakers. If you already have spare speakers that you could repurpose for fronts, I would highly encourage you to give it a try.
* Does this setup support Sonos Amp?
   * Yes.
* Can I mix and match speakers with SonoSequencr?
   * Yes, you can mix and match speakers with SonoSequencr. However, I would caution you to stick to similar range of speakers (ie. Sonos Play:1, Sonos One, IKEA Symfonisk Bookshelf, IKEA Symfonisk Table Lamp, IKEA Symfonisk Picture Frame) and not mix with speakers that have differing capabilities (in terms of mixing left-right, not front-rear). Any mix of speakers not officially supported by Sonos would also mean sacrificing Trueplay.
* Where can I find more information about a setup with *xyz*?
   * Check r/SonoSequencr. There you can find posts from users that have experimented with various combinations of speakers to determine which speaker drivers get disabled in various configurations and get their impressions of their setups.
* Do I still need the SonoSequencr app after configuring my setup?
   * No, you can do everything normally within the Sonos App. SonoSequencr is only required if you want to rearrange your setup with front speakers or toggle Trueplay on the setup that has front speakers.
* Are you associated with SonoSequencr?
   * No.
* What setup are you personally running?
   * Soundbar: Sonos Beam Gen 2
   * Fronts: Sonos One SLs
   * Surrounds: IKEA Symfonisk Picture Frames
   * Sub: Sub Mini
   * WiFi: UniFi Express 7 in AP Mode hardwired with ethernet back to a UDM Pro (All speakers connected wirelessly, no hardwire ethernet, no SonosNet)
   * Settings: EQ Bass +1, Treble +4, Sub +5, Height +6, Speech Enhancement On

""Can you?"" He dropped the papers on the coffee table. ""Because Sarah sure couldn't when I ran into her at Costco. She seemed really confused when I thanked her for hosting you so often. Asked why you never visit anymore since you moved to the new house.""

My stomach dropped. Sarah. My college roommate who I told him I'd been visiting. Sarah who lives four hours away and who I actually haven't seen in person for three years.

""She showed me pictures of her kids,"" he continued. ""Asked if we wanted to do a couples thing sometime. Said she missed you but understood you were busy with your new job.""

I tried to say something but nothing came out.

""I bought detergent and rotisserie chicken and made small talk with your college friend while my wife was apparently checking into hotels twenty minutes from our house every other weekend for two years."" He laughed but it sounded wrong. ""I even told her to tell you hi.""

""It's not what you think.""

""Then what is it?"" He pulled out his phone. ""Because I've been thinking about what costs $180 every other Friday for two years. That's $18,000. On our joint account that I never checked because I trusted you.""

I wanted to tell him the truth right then. That I wasn't cheating. That the hotels were just for me. That I needed somewhere quiet to write, to think, to just exist without being someone's wife or someone's employee or someone's anything. That I'd tried to write at coffee shops but people were loud and at libraries they closed too early and our house felt suffocating.

But when I opened my mouth what came out was, ""I needed space.""

""Space."" He repeated the word like he'd never heard it before. ""You needed $18,000 worth of space.""

""I was going to tell you.""

""When? Year three? Year five?"" He was pacing now. ""I called Sarah after I got to the car. Asked her directly when she last saw you. She said your wedding. Our wedding four years ago.""

""I'm sorry.""

""Sorry for what exactly? For lying? For stealing money from our savings account? We were supposed to buy a house next year and I've been eating lunch from home and skipping drinks with coworkers while you were checked into hotels with robes and room service.""

""I never got room service,"" I said and immediately regretted it.

He stared at me. ""What are you doing in these hotels?""

""Writing. Just writing. I'm working on a book.""

""A book."" His face did something I'd never seen before. ""You're telling me you've been lying to me for two years about visiting your friend so you could write a book in secret?""

""I knew you wouldn't understand.""

""Try me.""

So I told him. About how I'd started writing in our first apartment but he'd always interrupt to show me something on his phone or ask what was for dinner. About how I'd tried to carve out time at home but there was always laundry or dishes or him wanting to watch a show together. About how the hotels were the only place I could think clearly.

""You couldn't just tell me you needed time alone?"" he asked. ""You couldn't say 'hey, I'm going to a coffee shop for a few hours' like a normal person?""

""You would have made it about you.""

Wrong thing to say. I knew it immediately.

""I would have made YOUR lying about ME?"" His voice finally rose. ""I asked you every single time where you were going. Every time you said Sarah's house. I asked about her kids, her husband, how the drive was. And you looked me in the face and lied.""

""I know.""

""Do you?"" He grabbed the papers again. ""Because I spent the last two hours going through everything. The hotels. The food charges. The spa treatment you got in March. The $200 wine bar receipt.""

""That was research for my book.""

""I don't care what it was for!"" He threw the papers down and they scattered across the floor. ""You stole from our joint savings. You lied about where you were. For two years I thought you were maintaining a friendship and you were just hiding from me.""

""I wasn't hiding from you.""

""Then what do you call secretly checking into hotels every other weekend and lying about your location?""

I didn't have an answer for that.

He went to our bedroom and came back with a duffel bag. Started pulling his clothes from the closet.

""What are you doing?""

""Going to my brother's. I need space too. Difference is I'm telling you about it.""

""Don't go. Please. We can work this out.""

He stopped packing and looked at me. ""Are there any other lies? Anything else you've been keeping from me?""

I thought about the finished manuscript on my laptop. The agent who'd requested it. The potential book deal I hadn't mentioned because I wanted it to be a surprise.

""No,"" I said.

He zipped the bag. ""I'll be back for more of my stuff this weekend. Don't contact me unless it's an emergency.""

""This is an emergency.""

""No,"" he said. ""An emergency is what I felt like when Sarah looked confused about hosting you. This is just consequences.""

He left and I sat there surrounded by highlighted credit card statements showing every lie I'd told. My phone buzzed. Sarah. ""Your husband seems nice! We should really plan that couples weekend. Miss you!""

I haven't moved from the couch in three hours. The hotel receipts are all around me and I keep thinking about how I was going to surprise him with the book news if it happened. How proud he would have been. How I ruined everything because I couldn't just be honest about needing time alone.

My friend says I should have just told him the truth from the beginning but I knew he'd make it difficult. My mom says I destroyed my marriage over a hobby. His brother just texted saying my husband is staying there indefinitely and I should be ashamed.

I really thought I was doing the right thing by protecting my creative space but now I'm wondering if I'm just selfish.

AITA?

1q9s1ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1q9s1ps/33f_looking_for_a_cool_person_to_chat_with_being/,[33/F] Looking for a cool person to chat with being friends.,"I'm in search of a true friend—someone to share phone conversations with, watch movies together, and be there through both the ups and downs of life. Here’s a bit about me if you’d like to connect:

Originally from the Midwest, I now reside in New York City. I have a love  for bubble baths (bath bombs are absolutely the best!), and you’ll often find me enjoying iced coffee—yes, even in winter! I love spending time in bookstores, especially when it comes to fiction. I love movies, and some of my all-time favorites include 'The Holiday,' 'The Wizard of Oz,' and 'The Sound of Music.'

I believe I'm a good person—kind and patient, yet not easily taken advantage of. Allow me to share a bit about myself: I don't have much time for socializing due to my demanding work schedule. While I do have friends and engage in activities, my work commitments often align with their free time. They are happily married with children, and I genuinely celebrate their happiness, but our lifestyles are quite different, which is why I find myself here.

I’m a night owl, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. I enjoy sipping on ice-cold Coca-Cola while diving into audiobooks or catching up on a series or movie.

I lean towards the blue side politically, so please reach out only if you share a similar viewpoint. Additionally, if you devote a lot of time to video games, I’d prefer you not to contact me. Also, if you are a massive sports fan and must watch hours of sports a week, please don’t contact me; that’s not my idea of a good time.

I’m looking to chat with folks aged 25-46 who live in the United States or Canada. Wishing everyone the best in their search!",1,1768112593.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.67,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1q9s0de,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoOpGaming/comments/1q9s0de/android20132015_horizontal_cafe_game_serve/,"[ANDROID][2013-2015] Horizontal cafe game - Serve multiple customers at a bottom counter, burn food, upgrade machines","Platform(s): Android (maybe iOS). Played offline.
Estimated year of release:Around 2014-2015, maybe earlier.
Graphics/art style:2D or pseudo-3D. Less colorful and ""childish"" than games like Cooking Fever. More semi-realistic or serious cartoon style.
Notable characters:A recurring elderly male customer who always ordered egg dishes. Also a boss/chef (a man) who gave instructions.
Notable gameplay mechanics:

· Interface: The game was in horizontal (landscape) mode. The counter was at the BOTTOM or left side of the screen. 3 to 4 customers would appear side-by-side (horizontally) at this counter, each with their own order and patience meter.
· Core Gameplay: You controlled a character (or tapped directly) kitchen machines located in the upper/central part of the screen (coffee maker, toaster, griddle for eggs/waffles). You tapped a machine, waited for a circular timer, and if you were late, the food BURNED. Then you delivered the plate to the customer at the counter.
· Progression: With money earned in levels, you upgraded the machines (speed, capacity). After completing a set of levels, you changed locations/restaurants (new cafe scenario).
· Life System: If you failed a level, you lost a resource (they weren't called ""lives""). If you lost them all, you had to WAIT real-time for them to recharge (or pay premium currency).
· Typical Foods: Coffee, sandwiches, waffles, eggs.
  Other details:I vaguely remember the app icon might have been blue with a blonde woman/girl, but I'm not sure. It was not an online/social game.

Games it's NOT: It is NOT Cooking Fever, Burger Shop, Diner Dash, Restaurant Story (Storm8), Cooking Mama, or the ""Delicious"" series (GameHouse).",0,1768112469.0,CoOpGaming,0,0.5,False
1q9s09x,https://www.reddit.com/r/clat/comments/1q9s09x/reality_check_a_corporate_job_isnt_everything_in/,Reality Check- A corporate job isn't everything in life,"With the current CLAT allotments and lists coming out, I'm seeing a resurgence of posts on this sub where people's only criteria for deciding which college to opt for is placements. I get it, not everyone is privileged enough to attend an NLU without a loan and ROI matters, but do you all know what a corporate job even entails before choosing it?

Here is a glimpse of it from when I was an intern- you come to office at 9:30 am sharp, any later and they look at you as a criminal. You are expected to be available in office until minimum 11pm-12am, and sometimes even at 2am when some dickhead of a partner calls you (no cab services in most corporate firms, even the top ones so you gotta figure out how to go back). They usually don't give food in the office either. You won't receive any research or drafting work until you reach partner level for the most part, the work you do will all be due diligence and basically clerical work with no application of brains. And once you reach partner level, it's all about bringing clients. You can't bring new clients, you lose your status in the firm.

Bonus- you will be frowned upon by the HR if you have more than 2 cups of coffee because that's putting the firm into losses as per them. And when you do get placed, you are on probation for 6 months during which they can (and will) fire you for the smallest mistake. 

Yes, the pay is great, but is this really the kind of life you want to have for the next 10-12 years after graduation?",26,1768112459.0,clat,26,1.0,False

Lady Grey is nice but probably better for art then writing, look at the tones in that swatch, wow! The FWP inks are chef's kiss💋. I wrote something previously about the the Coffee Monster Co. collab with Esterbrook, I find it dry and too light although it looks decent in the photo, I don't see myself using it for any writing.",1,1768112392.0,fountainpens,0,0.56,False

(on purpose),"I’ve been really sensitive to caffeine lately but not ready to quit. I’d love recommendations for everyone’s favorite weak(er) cup of joe, half caf latte, dirty chai, or even a flavored sugary latte to try.
Usually I love Beanmonger’s, Everyman and Enso’s but I fear those places will probably continue to deliver me a full force caffeine experience ",4,1768112379.0,parkslope,2,0.83,False
1q9ryzn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9ryzn,Does my basil need replanting?,"Got this pot of basil mid-2025 from a nursery. It originally had 7 individual plants growing, but after a case of mealybugs and scale infestation, only three have survived. 

The pests are now under control (at least I think they are) and I'd fertilise it every two months, with more frequent feeding of used coffee grounds. While the plant has flourished a little better since the pest management and fertilising, it still feels like something is missing and it could do better. My suspicion is to try repotting, but I can't tell if it's overcrowded.

The plant gets a fair amount of sunlight and I water it twice a week with around what I'd estimate to be 350ml of water with each watering. ",3,1768112342.0,plantclinic,4,1.0,False
