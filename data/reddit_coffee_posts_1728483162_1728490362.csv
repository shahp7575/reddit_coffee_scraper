Ever wondered what a project manager's day looks like? This image from Vabro pretty much nails it:

* Juggling phone calls and laptop work ✅
* Constantly watching the clock ✅
* Rushing between meetings ✅
* Drowning in paperwork ✅
* Late nights at the office ✅
* And of course, fueling it all with coffee ✅

As a PM Professional myself, I can confirm this is painfully accurate. 

Does anyone else relate to this chaos, or is it just me?

What's your most relatable moment from this collage? For me, it's definitely that 'staring at the clock while on a call' scene!

It briefly stopped during my teenage years then it came back, by then I constantly lied about eating because I was so used to avoid eating from my childhood years, but my adult body needed more nutrition and I couldn't fake it by only drinking juices anymore, I started fainting constanyly, losing focus, and falling into a deep depression. So I decided to take action, I needed to force me to be hungry somehow, I spoke with some specialists and they helped me create a meal plan, along with some exercises to achieve this goal, and little by little it worked. It's been 5 years of this, and I also shared this with my friends whom since then have been a bit more aware whether I'm eating or not, they have been quite proud I am more independent in that sense. 

The issue: recently I've been feeling in a rut, constantly unmotivated, tired, feeling almost trapped, and my family has been complaining about my weight gain (I do doctor check-up a every 6 months, I'm healthy). I usually don't mind when people comment on my body, but recently I've been feeling nauseous at the sight of fast food (I don't eat it too often, but when I do I love it), anything that's fried, too much bread, too much sugar, anything with any type of grease. Some days I've only eaten fruit because everything else feels like it'll make me fat, I've started lying to my friends and family about eating again, and although I hadn't skipped a meal, today I looked at my breakfast and decided to just go for the coffee and nothing else, which is making me feel guilty because I promised myself I would always try to eat something, even if little. 

I don't know if this is just a phase or if I should go to the specialist again. I don't want to worry anyone in my life, but honestly, I am worried.",1,1728489843.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

There are a few tricks to get to 90 consistently.

1- Go to bed and leave bed at the same time every day. Try to have your meals around the same time too;

2- The earlier you stop eating in the day, the better. The lower your sleeping HR will be. Not so much about calories, but digestion - specially protein - puts an extra strain on your body. I try to stop around 5pm with a non protein smoothie. The best results are when I stop at 3h30pm;

3- Even if you wake up in the middle of the night, don't grab your phone. Just pretend you are dead. Focus on your breath. I have been doing this consistently and even if I'm not sleeping, fitbit thinks I am. You might think this is just a trick and does not get you any rest, and yes, not the same as a full black out sleep, but it is probably the next best thing. You will wake up rested!

I wake up at the middle of the night every single night to pee and tried everything, even not drinking any liquids past lunch, to no good results. This tip worked, even though I walk to the bathroom.

I meditate, and during a recent meditation retreat (10 days silent retreat, meditating more than 10h a day), fitbit many times took meditation as deep sleep or REM;

4- Ban electronics at least 1h before bed and read a book to wind down. Some meditation between reading and sleep will put you HR down and make it stay down the entire night;

5- Don't try to sleep as much as you can. This is a very common mistake. I often read the more sleep you get, the higher your performance. But if you get more sleep than usual, not only it will disrupt your circadian cycle, but it will also diminishes the sleep pressure for the next night, pretty much like you won't be so hungry after going all out in an all-you-can-eat buffet! It takes some time to learn your sweet spot. Mine is 7h, but I'm 53M. People have different needs.

There are all the other common sense tips, like avoiding alcohol, coffee, cannabis, and so on. Alcohol is a sleep quality killer. But some coffee early morning is not detrimental, especially if you have a physically active routine. Also, avoid action or intense movies or shows at night! Seems like not a big deal, but there is a clear correlation between intense shows and a high heart rate at the first hours of your sleep. Same goes to video games and social media.

Due to life events, I had originally owed the IRS about $9,000. I ignored the notice, having more imminent concerns to address. I started receiving more notices, for $9,500, $10,300, etc. I made sure to open the letters and read them in full, but I simply couldn't deal with the trouble at the time. I was working at a job which paid $8/hr and was struggling to afford rent and keep my uniform clean. One day I received a notice that I now owe over $13,000 and I spat out my proverbial coffee. I thankfully had a new job by then and the conversation with the IRS agent was pleasant, for what it was. There is literally a form for everything, doubt of collectability, doubt of liability, you name it. 

They set me up in a payment plan with the expectation that the $13,000 would be paid in full within 6 months. During this time I could complete an ""Offer in Compromise"" to determine monthly payments for when I inevitably fail out of the preconceived plan. When I sat down to do the offer in compromise with the IRS, I discovered that they wanted me to pay $486 for two years, which was based on my new income. I laughed. I laughed in a way I never laughed before. I spent the following 6 months contacting varying IRS based debt relief services, and the first company I called out of three ended up being the one. They wanted $236 a month for 18 months which is still very tight, but more manageable. They are currently in negotiations with the IRS on my behalf which I appreciate, because navigating the IRS is not a joke. My representative believes I should be non-collectable, which we will determine here soon. If I am non-collectable, out of the $13,000+ sum I owed I would only have paid about $4200 for the resolution service. If an appeal is needed, and fails, the estimated payments to the IRS would be <$50, which is something I don't specifically have, but still a more manageable number. 

I'm under the impression that my life circumstances would be enough to prevent collection, and that the IRS would take pity on me as I had experienced recent homelessness amongst other things prior to amassing this debt, but time will tell. Regardless I am entering month three out of eighteen for the resolution service and already feel so much better. ",0,1728489661.0,debtfree,0,0.5,False

* Find someone who is **poly**, **kinky,** and **childfree**?
* Give and receive?
* Be in the present, experiencing each moment?
* Feel empowered to say **No**?
* Feel safe enough to say **Yes**?
* But you haven't been with someone you **trust**, who **accepts** you, and with whom you can feel **safe**?

Until now. Until me.

Boston area - 63M 5'9"" 170 lbs - Vaccinated 7x - Recent STD tests: all negative

I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs. I'm **not** a recovering drinker, smoker, nor drug user, I just never cared for them, nor to be around people who are drunk or high. I'm open to a considerate smoker, and someone who may enjoy a drink but doesn't **need** it to be social or intimate.

I'm quite happy with my life as it is. I'm open to meeting someone new if it works.

I have nothing but **respect** for people who choose to be parents and who strive to do it well. For me, I realized a long time ago that I did not want to have or raise children. Once in a while I have fun visiting with other people with children, and then I happily go home to my quiet, childfree life.

I started choosing to have ethically **open relationships** about 25 years ago. Being inclined to see more than one person at the same time is just part of who I am. I try to be as clear about this as I can early on, since integrity is a core value for me. I'm open to as much disclosure as each partner and I are comfortable negotiating

I take a ""non-hierarchical"" approach, i.e., speaking for myself, I don't treat any partner as ""primary,"" ""secondary,"" etc., which is probably a by-product of my not being married and living alone. If you have a different approach, that's fine.

We'll also probably have to discuss the terminology, since I've found that ""polyamory,"" ENM (ethical non-monogamy), and CNM (consensual non-monogamy) often mean somewhat different things to different people.

I offer:

* strength and experience
* empathy, patience, and acceptance
* compersion, e.g., I'm also happy when your other partners treat you well
* good sense of humor
* fairness and compassion
* a safe, healing space
* slow sensuality, warm aftercare
* the ability to make grammatically coordinated lists

I am:

* quietly enthusiastic, excited about life
* playful
* always learning, always curious, especially about you
* a good listener, most of the time
* supportive
* comfortable with silence, just being present, especially with you
* imperfect

I can:

* teach you about me, learn about you
* take responsibility for my mistakes and flaws, sometimes even learn from them
* be spontaneous, in a planned and careful way
* share my feelings, quietly listen to yours
* be kinky when it works for both of us, details to be discussed, never required

I have:

* room in my life for another if we're a good match
* healthy boundaries, respect for your boundaries
* the ability to really see you, if you feel safe enough to show me
* open relationships, honestly disclosed to whatever level of detail we're both comfortable with

I will treat you well. I embrace **both** careful consent and well-timed risk-taking. I'm told that I've got sparkling brown eyes and a warm, accepting smile.

I'm a **gentleman** with old-school manners, until you ask me not to be.

I'm looking for a woman who:

* loves to share food in a restaurant or on our own
* insists on being treated well, stands up for herself
* wants to explore her sensual submissive side, or explore it further
* enjoys flavors beyond vanilla

Someone who is:

* kind
* smart and capable by day, sometimes wants someone else to take the lead when she doesn't have to be in charge
* affectionate, loves to touch and be touched
* curious, wants to learn more

Someone who can:

* ask questions
* teach me about you, what you like and need
* learn about me
* laugh about dualities and contradictions, debate how to unpack and accept them, possibly even change them

The following are not important to me, I have no expectations or requirements about your level of interest:

* travel
* sports
* long-distance relationships
* penpals

Note that I don't require that you are 100% compatible with **every** item listed above. I hope that, like me, you aspire to do your best most of the time.

I'm in no hurry.

Let's talk. After some messaging, if we both feel comfortable we can then meet in person over coffee or ice cream, with no pressure, no agenda except to talk more and see how it feels being together.

2- 🔌 A given, but charge all your devices, ryobi tool batteries, usb-c lights, power banks, bluetooth speakers, etc — and KEEP YOUR PHONE CONTINUALLY PLUGGED — dont forget to replug after filming the swaying trees that you’re sending to your relatives in Pennsylvania 

3- 👚 Wash all your clothes, towels, and bedding now - if there’s no power for a week, having a crispy change of clothes will be crucial

4- 🚿 If you like hot showers, as soon as power goes out, go take a hot shower — might be your last one for a while… if you have roommates, dont tell them your plan, be considerate (make it quick), but get yours first 🤣

5- ☕️ Pre-brew and freeze coffee in batches — you might not get hot coffee in the morning, but nothin like a caffeine headache with no power

6- 🚰 If youre freezing water bottles, pour out roughly 25% to keep bottle from exploding (Ive known this and still busted a gallon already)

7- 💊 If you’re stressed, or want some sleep.. take some Magnesium supplements (assuming you have some)— its easy to forget the basics when the shenanigans are happening

8- ❄️ As wind starts picking up - crank the A/C down well below what you normally would, give yourself as much buffer as possible 

9- 🏊‍♂️ Lower pool level now a few inches, and keep monitoring 

10- 🍝 Assume tonight will be your last chance for a hot meal for a couple days, go all out, and enjoy it

11- 😌 Be present and enjoy the peace of the silent city once the storm passes (minus chainsaws) 

12- 👋 You’ve been putting it off, but this will be your opportunity to introduce yourself to your weird neighbors when yall are out looking at damage.  Hurricanes always bring the community together, embrace it.

During this time, I used to sleep on the sofa a lot and my sleep schedule was awful. If I had to guess I would say I committed to just falling asleep every night on the sofa maybe for almost an entire year. The only people in the house was me, my brother who at the time was no less than 4 or 5 years old, and my dad. My dad’s house was pretty big especially the downstairs and the area itself was pretty sketchy but none of this bothered me as I spent every night staying awake watching TV and playing video games until I fell asleep on the sofa from exhaustion. Nothing out of the ordinary ever really happened from what I can remember while being alone downstairs apart from one night which really messed with my head. 

I was doing my usual watching TV into the late hours of the night, my dad and brother slept in the same bed upstairs and they were both already fast asleep. There was a sofa and a chair in the living room and on the back of the chair was a pile of blankets that were placed perfectly on top of each other , I also had a laptop that I would use to death while I was watching TV, I remember that night I was getting so tired that I slouched down into the sofa, still with my laptop screen and the TV turned on in front of me. I fell asleep soon after that, I woke up feeling confused as when I finally opened my eyes, one of the blankets from the back of the chair was neatly placed on top of me, I turned my head to where my laptop was, or where my laptop should’ve been. There was a coffee table that separated the TV and sofa from itself, I looked down at the table and saw that my laptop was also very neatly closed and placed perfectly under the coffee table. The TV was turned off and the remote was again, just like everything else, perfectly placed where it belongs. I remember feeling confused and displaced as I know for a fact that I didn’t do anything of this at all, I didn’t really think much of it though for long as I just told myself that my dad must’ve came down in the night and done it all, surely right? 

Anyway, my dad eventually comes downstairs with my brother and I ask him if he did this, he looked at me confused and said no. I thought maybe he was playing a joke on me as he was the type to do that but the look on his face told me that he had no idea what I was talking about. My mind felt scattered, my brother couldn’t have done it as he was only 4 and everything was so perfectly done, it wouldn’t have been him at all. 
I started to get scared at the prospect of the entire thing, did I sleepwalk and do it myself? I tried to convince myself that it must’ve been me sleep walking but it was still strange as I’ve never sleepwalked at all before and why would I put back everything where it belongs and get the blanket? And why was everything so perfectly done? Especially the fact that there was no indication that the second blanket was taken from the rest of the pile at all, if it was me; I would’ve been sure that I would’ve left a bit of a mess behind. I’ve heard of people sleepwalking and getting food but this just wasn’t like me at all. I would say I’m quite a deep sleeper apart from when someone touches me in my sleep, I’ve always been like that and I always immediately wake up. Wouldn’t I have woken up if I felt a blanket being placed upon me? 

This continued to bother me for weeks on end and even when I returned to my dad’s house. I started sleeping upstairs in my actual bed again because of how freaked out I was. I did tell other people about the incident but I just laughed it off with them but even they were freaked out about it which just made me feel worse. I started thinking about maybe it was a ghost and I do believe in paranormal activity and the supernatural but I’ve never really taken it seriously.

Still to this day, I can’t think of a logical explanation that would make complete sense of what actually happened while I was asleep..",3,1728489116.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I then noticed the pot glizzy smoker was in fact looking at something as well, in utter disbelief. He was watching someone enjoy there morning coffee and what looked like a breakfast sandwich.  He set It down for a minute as he scratched his itchy butt. Then with the same hand I saw him pick the sandwich up and take a bite, just to be distracted by a stray dog.  This dogs owner wasn't very responsible and was very far behind, letting his dog maybe be hit by a car or to steal poor innocent people's food in the park. And guess what! That's exactly what happened!

Got root canal and then a cap I've had for 40 years.

The color / curve never matched my other tooth.

A couple years ago I thought for my daughter's wedding to redo it and dentists talked about cutting gums to even out the gum line and a new cap.

The gum cutting especially seemed overkill for something I've kinda ignored for 40 years.

I tried some home whitening kits, but the fake one (left one)  is always lighter. (the real and fake (left) all brighten at same rate?! Never going to get them equal?  Also tried / used 3% hydrogen peroxide (i'd sit with it for 10s of minutes at a time in my mouth), colgate / crest whitening toothpaste and mouthwashes...

Son's wedding coming up and wonder again.... is there a way to whiten the other teeth to the fake (can't darken the fake to the rest of them... can I ?)

In this pic for some reason, the cap and most of the other teeth seem almost same whiteness?  Not really the case.  The front right and others are closer in whiteness / fake stands out as whiter

Here's another:

I don't smoke and don't drink coffee.  I used to bite my nails (and sometimes the nail would slip / hit the gums on the right tooth.... I think that's (part of) how the gum line for that got to be higher than the fake??

I get more focused, but the anxiety is insane sometimes.

I get afraid that I smell, or that I'm acting weird. Even encountering a cashier is awkward when hung over. Hangovers make me horribly tense and sometimes shaky from the anxiety. I don't want to fuck up my new job, and I think it's actually gone really well - but of course socially I must have appeared anxious and uncertain even though I've received good feedback. 

I've been drinking 5-6 out of 7 days on average for a few weeks or months, 5-12 drinks depending on the day and when I start, but likely 6 drinks on average and 12 on the weekends. I'm 31, and the alcohol hasn't been a problem for more than 2 years with weekend binging, and a year more with constant drinking with one break of three months where I instead got to enjoy chemo. 

I've been drinking for ten days straight since my last one day break - but nothing today - and honestly I mostly feel fine right now. Though I have that feeling of stasis, of not wanting to do anything after work. I just end up mindlessly scrolling waiting until I hopefully get some sleep. For the last good while not even movies or shows have interested me. I love working again because other than that I simply exist.

And the sleep I get has been awful, keep waking up after a few hours. To sleep through the night I either have to get good and blasted or be sober for a while. 

But I feel temptation today, and more and more I have felt that I am finally done. I want to look good again, and feel good again, and actually live life, and I have proven that I cannot do that with to a degree that I think it's actually over. 

Anyways, this turned out more ranty than I though. I can't wait to get back in the gym and start rebuilding my body after the chemo and insane amounts of beer, especially during the last year!",1,1728488867.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I need some outsider perspective especially Danish people for this matter.

I'm working for a startup for food and beverage manufacturing that focus solely on coffee with not so great salary. My main tasks were only in Business Development and Marketing Communication,  2 months ago, I was put in charge of Product Development despite having no background or indepth knowledge on Food Science. I proposed this idea and even research the ingredients list as well as possible formulars for product testing as the company have one lab technician. At first the Co-Founders were on board with the idea as the company is testing with recycled coffee grounds and it could be a great opportunity to have as a collaboration with Peter Larsen Kaffe. After a month and in the middle of the innitial testing, one of the Co-Founders did not like the idea of the company collaborating with Peter Larsen Kaffe anymore and she is afraid that we have to give Peter Larsen everything from shares to formulas, recipes so she rejected everything, despite already drafting potential paperworks to protect the company in this case.

This frustrates me since the same Co-Founder is in charge of the company's finance and she always over spends the budget on silly things like 2 nights stay for herself at a central hostel in Copenhagen just to participate at TechBBQ or a separate AirBnB accomodation for both her and her fiance at Kolding for a 3 day workshop hosted by the investors. I guess I'm just frustrated in general but the question is with my ideas and all the documents that are in my possesion for not just this product but other products, can I bring them as an asset to Peter Larsen Kaffe and ask if I can work with them to create this product as they have more resources and most important, more food scientists that can further develope the formula?

Can I do this in Denmark? and I did have a consultation with a lawyer about NDA and IP laws that this could be involves? I'm just not sure if something like this exists before. I'm a non-EU citizen that's why I'm not familiar",1,1728488817.0,dkkarriere,1,1.0,False

1fzujui,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1fzujui/south_america_travel_itinerary/,South America Travel Itinerary,"Hello Reddit travelers!

We are a couple from Sweden, 30 and 27 years old, planning a 6-week trip through South America starting in January 2024. We’ve already booked our arrival and departure flights, landing in Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd of January and flying home from San José, Costa Rica, on the 18th of February. We love to explore both cities and nature, but prefer to keep things fairly comfortable, avoiding long hikes and multi-day camping trips. We’ll mostly be flying between countries to save time and exploring various destinations without overloading our schedule. We're looking to stay in private rooms at hostels to stay on budget, but might consider hotels for a few nights in total if they're worth the extra buck.

We have a route in mind and would love any feedback, especially tips on the must-sees, hidden gems, and general advice on logistics!

--- January 3–13 (10 days) – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

We’re thinking about staying in the Ipanema area, close to Copacabana. Planning to explore iconic spots like Sugarloaf Mountain, Selarón Steps, Parque Lage, and the beaches of course. We’re considering hang-gliding for an adrenaline rush and a favela tour (probably Rocinha or Santa Marta if it’s safe). Also, places like the Royal Portuguese Reading Room and Metropolitan Cathedral seem worth checking out. For a chill day, we might go to Urca for local vibes at Bar Urca or Garota da Urca.

We are also debating whether to include a trip to Iguazu Falls as a day activity while we’re in Rio. We’ve seen some hotels offering package deals for around 200-300 USD per person, and we’re wondering if it’s worth it. Anyone who has done this, is it worth squeezing in? We’re unsure about a day trip to Ilha Grande or whether it’s worth adding it at the start – any suggestions on that?

--- January 13–15 (2 days) – Fly to Lima, Peru.

We’ve heard great things about the food here and might try one of Gaston Acurio’s restaurants. Mostly planning to explore the city, wander through Miraflores, and check out local museums.

--- January 15–19 (4 days Cusco) – Fly to Cusco, Peru.

We’ll explore the city of Cusco, visit its markets and are considering taking day trips to Vinicunca/Rainbow mountain and Sacred Valley. Do you think that's worth considering the risky weather in january?

--- January 19–21 (2 days Aguas Calientes/Machu Picchu).

We plan on taking the train to Aguas Calientes and visiting Machu Picchu early in the morning the day after. Since we’ll be there in January, we’re aware the sunrise might not be visible due to the season. Any advice on timing? Thinking about visiting Huayna Picchu as well, if the weather allows.

--- January 21-24 (3 days) – (From Cusco) Fly to Cartagena, Colombia.

We plan to spend a few days exploring the city, especially the Old Town, before heading out on some day trips to the nearby areas.

--- January 24-30 (7 days) – Around Cartagena, Colombia.

We’re looking at staying in a few coastal spots with great beaches. Any must-visit places near Cartagena? We’ve heard about Minca and islands outside of Santa Marta, for example. We probably won’t be traveling all over Colombia, but is it worth adding another flight to explore another part of the country? We have heard that Bogota probably is not worth the time and flight it would take to get there. Would you say that any other area such as Medellin and the Coffee region are must-visits? We’re also curious if anyone has done a sailing trip from Cartagena to San Blas? A friend recommended it, but we’re unsure if it is worth the time (rougly 6 days) and money (roughly 700 USD)?

--- January 30–February 18 (18 days) – Fly to Costa Rica.

We're planning on keeping this this quite flexible and free, but we’ve heard the Pacific coast is fantastic. Thinking of spending some time in Santa Teresa for surfing and chilling. Any other recommended spots in Costa Rica for a mix of nature and relaxation? We’ll be in Costa Rica until February 18th, so we have some time to explore and not plan too much ahead. Would love tips on places beyond Santa Teresa, especially on the west coast or nearby.

We’re aiming for a balance between adventure and relaxation while being budget-conscious. Also, if anyone has hostel recommendations with private rooms, please let us know! Thanks in advance!",1,1728488788.0,backpacking,0,1.0,False

It never made full sense to me since we split since we understood our circumstances (she’s a year older than me), we were going to go to different universities too. I always asked her if everything was ok or if I should do anything for her to help her get over it, but she hasn’t responded to me for a year so I just left it as is and wished the best for her. 

I wanted to just speak about this a little bit cause one, of course I want to catch up with her, and two, I found it quite interesting. I may initiate a conversation and see how that goes.

I have a question as I'm already thinking about Christmas which ofc all my family and friends celebrate. So as not to end up with unwanted items we make wishlists of things we want /  need which is better for the planet but there is no magic or surprise anymore, no meaning! When I dont need anything, I will ask for donations to small indie charities or animal sanctuaries in lieu of gifts and all my neices and nephews get animal adoption packs, but usually there will be gifts between the adults.

Last Halloween I threw a charity event for Macmillan and I made coffee body scrubs as prizes which were a hit. I'd love some other ideas of gifts I can make, ingredients that are easy to source but powerful. My family aren't as with the earth as I am, so I wouldn't want to go too 'unusual', stuff that regular people would be happy to receive / use (like the coffee and coconut scrubs!). I'm also vegan so no animal products. 

If you've any fave beauty or arty things you like to make I'd love to know!

1fzu9k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1fzu9k1/pathfinder_clan_first_to_harass_last_to_act/,"Pathfinder Clan: ""First to harass, last to act""","Last night I had my first terrible interaction with the PF (Pathfinder) clan playing warfare. I haven't really fell in love with any servers yet and usually go for lowest ping/shortest queue combo, and ended up in the PF server. Hopped in the open recon squad (locked, get mics people) and went about gary hunting and whatnot. I'm pretty comfortable with most classes, and am one of those who tries to fill roles when needed to get the team running smoothly. A few snipers joined (all lower ranks), I did a mic check, and if I haven't heard from them by my next death they get the boot. If you want to hamper the team by not giving or receiving information, that's your choice, but you can't act surprised when you're removed for someone who will.


Cue PF Gambit. Requests, joins, doesn't use comms, gets the boot. Then PF Gambit continues to spam me with invites for probably the next 10+ minutes. I've had people do this before and they usually tire out after a while, but not PF Gambit. Probably close to 200-300 invites later, I'm hiding in a bunker just tapping R d-pad continuously to decline. I go into Command chat and say


""Guys can we do a vote to kick on PF Gambit, he's spamming me with invites continuously because I kicked him for not using comms""

PF COFFEE (SL): ""You can't kick people on this server. Besides, you can't kick someone for requesting to join a squad, that's ridicluous""

ME: ""...it's not because of the request, it's because of the couple hundred requests, its ruining the gaming experience for me. Can you guys ask him to stop at least since he's in your clan""

COFFEE: ""No. Why don't you just let him join?""

ME: ""Asked if he had comms and got no response. Also, since when is giving in to someone bullying or harassing me the way to deal with a problem? Isn't that enabling?""

PF TOLLIVER (SL) and Fhiskey (Commander) join in: ""I don't get why you don't let him join?""

ME: ""Just explained that, and again, how is the right thing to do? Enabling someone harassing someone else by giving them what they want?""

COFFEE: (goes full apologist at this point) ""You can't kick someone out for requesting to join! There's nothing wrong with it!""

ME: ""Of course it does; if someone calls you phone and you ask them not to call again but they do anyways for the next 20 minutes, it's easy to say ignore it, move on, unless it's happening to you. This really how Pathfinder conducts itself? Go fuck yourselves"" (Can't block invites on HLL)


PF Gambit now joins command chat to tell me, not to ask or apologize, but to DEMAND ""Let me into your fucking squad!"" This is hilarious to me because he could have hopped in command chat after the boot and say ""hey I do have a mic"" and we could have played, but instead thinks that doing his best to ruin my game and then shouting will get him what he wants. I truly feel sad for anyone who has to deal with this person in real life, your parents and role models are complete and utter failures, and you'll forever be a middle school bully who stomps his feet and tries to get what he wants by making people's lives so unenjoyable they're too exasperated interact with you.


At this point, Coffee, Tolliver, Gambit and Fhiskey have all taken the ""Why don't you just let him play?"" approach and are now complaining that my complaining is ruining their game experience...Well imagine fucking that hey? You didn't staunch the flow of bullshit and it rolled all the way to your feet and you STILL haven't asked your teammate and clan member to stop being a childish, antagonistic cunt. Again, WHY would you think that his chosen course of action should yield results? If you don't want to stand up for what's right unless it's directly affecting you, it's probably not very hopeful the guy that just asked for help whom you told to go screw himself is going to give a damn if you're also having a bad time


Clipped the video, posted it here, sent it off the Xbox reporting harassment as well. PF Gambit, PF Tolliver, PF Coffee, and Fhiskey; you should all be ahamed of yourselves. You give your clan a bad name, you give HLL a bad name, you give online gaming a bad name, and you are disappointments to the human race. If someone is being a piece of human garbage, speak up so they stop. If you don't want to, try not to bitch when the wind blows that garbage your way. 


If you're in the Pathfinder clan, talk to your members. This sort of stuff reflects on your community, but if you want to be known as the next toxic garbage clan then feel free to continue enabling your members to hurt people when they don't get their way. I look forward to watching you and 7Cav trading members back and forth the same way the Catholic church hides pedophiles and corrupt police forces shuffle their dirtbags around rather than remove the cancers from their organization

There was once a boy who lived in a world not so unlike the one you find yourself in today- up was up and down was down and the color blue was widely debated but generally agreed upon, especially by those who had equations and computers to tell them so.

Now, when I say boy- I mean a young man who came of age legally within his society at 18, but who was now 23. He was born- and was mostly useless, and anyways he didn’t remember much from then. He completed his schooling from the ages of 6 until 22, attending a university to study in a field that did not need or want him. He had few friends, and mostly occupied himself by indulging in sex with his girlfriend, who herself was prone to mostly sleeping in and making abstract, mediocre art in the time that remained. He also loved to read but found that there were fewer and fewer books he cared about, since most of what was being said or storied was very absurd to be worrying about considering the days of his life that melted away in reading it.

It was a weekday- and he had skipped class that day for no discernable reason. He was confident that he could pass any test given to him so long as he had 24-72 hours to look over the pre-packaged content- so why attend a lecture where a fellow ape who thought themselves very important indeed would tell him of things less certain than up- or even the color blue? The boy was lounging on his bed- twisting the soft blonde hair of his naked partner. Her heavy breasts were uncovered, but the several twisted linens covered her midriff and below, and it was this tragedy that he was considering when she spoke in that vaguely accented, feminine voice of hers. ‘I’m thinking I’ll head out tomorrow. Go live with my mother for a bit.’

Oh?

‘Yeah- I applied for this job with a nanny company somewhere else- and I want to be ready for it.’ The boy had already stopped twirling her hair and had sat up in bed, pulling on his underwear as if to shield his vulnerability from a fleeting trust. The girl continued- ‘I’ve been thinking a lot about us- about where we’re going. I figure we would get married if I stayed, and we could have sex once a week and maybe you’d get a nice job, and if we’re lucky my art might sell, and I could have shows. And then we could get a house and brush our teeth every morning and- I’m just not sure I want to spend my life so predictably. Ya know? I want to live a little- have something to tell my children about, something to be proud of. I want to be different from everyone else, I guess.’

The boy was struck by the cruelty of these words and continued to get dressed in defense. He pulled on a pair of dark jeans- considering he still wasn’t sure about the color blue he thought it pertinent to describe them as such, and was pulling a shirt on of some other color and material not blue or denim when the thought entered his mind that he should kill himself.

He catalogued this option for consideration that evening and moved onto more serious thoughts. The girl’s mouth was still moving, but he couldn’t really hear her since he was mostly just watching her breasts move as she shifted up in bed to look at him. Why would this woman want to be so different? What was wrong with being happy like everyone else? Did every one of the billions of human lives need to be so unique and full of adventure and import that a house where you could reliably brush your teeth was a sinful way to spend one?

As he continued to philosophize in misery, the boy reached out and tenderly grasped the girls breast, and she froze in place- a look of astonished insult on her face, before slapping his hand away and storming up out of bed. The boy enjoyed his last look at her naked body as she dressed, not even bothering to listen to his own ongoing monologue of useless rationality.

 

Chapter 2.

 

It had been about a week, or maybe just a few days since his girl left. He had spent this time weeping in bed about romanticized versions of his life that he could no longer attain with the girl and feeling sorry about the fact that he was very hungry for sex. He had considered at length the option of self destruction, and even went so far as to search up how to tie a noose, before realizing he had no rope on hand, nor gun or pill, and felt fearful about bleeding to death by dull kitchen knife, so he moved on from the thought after the second night or so. Currently, he was wrapped in the linens of the week prior- the scent of his woman bleeding slowly from the sheets, until he wasn’t sure he could smell her at all. It was very late, and very, very dark.

What was the purpose of the boys life? He had previously been able to define himself through service to this woman, but then again he hadn’t even really been able to do that well, since if he had been trying his best to do that he would have taken seriously getting a high paying job- since that seemed to be what taking care of a person meant in his world. Or- he wouldn’t have complained when she asked for a glass of water in the middle of the night, or asked him to help her with her homework. So really- he was a terrible partner and had been deceiving himself in trying to find purpose that way.

In the beginning, there had been a tremendous amount of happiness that the girl had brought to him- both in pride at having a socially valuable good such as a beautiful woman, and in chemical happiness from physical closeness and sex and charming conversation. However, overindulgence in these things had turned sex into a need to be fulfilled, like food or water, and thus taken the pleasure from it. The chemical high of closeness and conversation grew stale, as did the social thrill of carrying her on his arm. He did not find fulfillment in his life this way- that he had known for a long time.

He supposed that children would have solved all of his problems of motivation and purpose, since then he would have as close to a divine purpose as any man- but he wasn’t quite sure that working every day to feed his dependents would make him happy or fulfilled. The brickmaker with hungry children in some poor country is kept very busy with a purpose he is bound to, but he is probably not content in the way that the boy thinks that he should be. If he was looking to pass his life quickly without letting his children starve- killing himself before he had them would do just fine to meet this goal.

The boy decided that- if he had no purpose or meaning in his life, he would have to set out into the world to try and find some. It was a simple goal- find a reason to be alive. But it seemed a near impossible one to start on. He figured he aught to first shed the things that distracted him. The things that gave him artificial senses of fulfillment and pleasure.

The boy opened his well used laptop and sent an email to all of the professors and mentors he knew.

Recipient(s): < all >

Subject: Leave me alone please

 

To all concerned,

 

Please leave me alone. I have decided to not create any product from my countless hours of schooling and from the large amount of currency that my schooling required. I am going to set out into the wilderness and find some reason to live- or maybe I will just die.

 

Thank you,

B

 

The boy hit send, and got up to go find a hammer with which to smash his computer. Rummaging through some drawers, he found a photo mounting kit that he and the girl had purchased when they first moved to the city, and he sat a while crying over this memory, forgetting his search for a hammer completely.

It was during this intermission that his laptop- seemingly eager to die, pinged out a cheerful alert. An email had been returned. The boy felt fear, and also that vortex pull of personal tragedy we all are too familiar with. He rummaged a bit more and found a screwdriver, which would do. He marched back into his room with the intent of violence, before giving in and opening the clam-shell of terror instead.

New Message (1)

Subject: Why not just die then?

 

The boy felt a tired smile break on his face- Dr. Rupitam was a well-respected philosophy professor who loved to have interesting conversations. He opened the email message with a twinge of excitement.

 

From: Dr. H. Rupitam

Subject: Re: Leave me alone please

 

Hello B,

 

Thank you for your email,

Why not just kill yourself then? The end goal of your planned journey is to find a will to live- which, we can assume, simply means that you will not have to worry about why or whether you are around. Dying serves this same purpose, and from everything I know about you there won’t be too many people who truly miss you.

Apart from the base animal instinct not to die a death at all- which is not only a deplorable basic instinct but is also impossible, I see no reason that you should be seeking out a will to live at all, unless you have some hope anyways.

I should hate to think that you are simply following your animal code without good human rationality, so please let me know what you were thinking.

 

All the best,

Dr. R

 

The boy thought long and hard about this response. He first decided that this was a matter of resource- that his life was a valuable resource that was spent very carefully by generals and governments, and that thus he should try to find a way to spend it before wasting it on a rope. However, he composed this response to Dr. Rupitam before deciding that this was ridiculous- since most people spent their lives without care at all- spending an hour a day driving your car to work, another on social media or sleeping in- you’ve already misallocated a large sliver of your life if each day contains such wastage. And men died meaninglessly from disease and war and crime constantly, even if doctors and generals tried to give gravitas to the struggle to prevent their deaths. there were simply too many humans for every life to be special and meaningful. The grand oceans of every experience and emotion diluted the importance of the individual man to a ridiculous extent. On the other end of the spectrum- in a world were there was only one human, would that humans’ experiences be any more important? Was rarity really the creator of value for an entity? Or was this simply a consumer truth that had pervaded the boys head?

After he had made himself a cup of cheap- maple flavored coffee, the boy fell into an exhausted slumber, and woke the next morning with an email composition floating through his skull.

Subject: Re: Re: Why not just die then?

 

Hi Doctor,

 

Thanks for your response. I think that my drive to go find a better way to spend my life than death stems from the fact that I have seen a better way to live a life. There are people who go through school and do very well and care very much and never think too hard about how or why. Then they get good jobs and fall in love and do good things and sleep at night, and have a home to brush their teeth in every morning, and they never- not even once, question what is blue, or what is up, or what the hell justice is. Or even really how to achieve it beyond what their teachers tell them.

I would like to find some purpose that helps me live like this- some-thing that defies all of my endless thoughts and helps me to be at peace.

 

Cheers,

 

B

 

After making sure the email had been sent, the boy took up the screwdriver he had forgotten on his nightstand the evening prior, and drove it through the screen of the laptop. He pulled it out as a spark snapped, and then he drive it thrice through the worn keyboard. He felt at peace with his mission, and thus began to pack a bag with some clothes and some food and a photo of his lost girl, and began to plan a journey into the wildlands.

2016

Kia Soul +

127Kish Miles

2.0L

Automatic

Some background before the issue started, I was having issues with the engine misfiring and took the car to the dealer for a diagnosis about a month ago. While the car was in the shop there was flooding from a hurricane and, according to the service department, my car was ""minorly"" flooded. All I know is that there was enough water for the carpet to be damaged and some electronics near the floor (currently my airbag light and ABS light are stuck on). (Quick aside: would a detail remove the mildew smell from the carpet or would it need to be replaced?) They wouldn't cover anything damaged by the flooding since it was a natural disaster but they replaced the ignition coil assembly which was the original cause of the misfiring.

When I picked up the car, I drove about 2 miles down the road to get lunch and once I got back in the car about 15 minutes later, it wouldn't start. When I turned the key, nothing happened at all mechanically. All the electronics powered on, but the key turn produced nothing but a very quiet hum sound for about 2 seconds. I tried a few more times, but eventually went back inside. I went back outside about 40 minutes later and tried again and the engine cranked on the second try. I went back to the dealer, but they informed me they couldn't diagnose it if they couldn't replicate the issue (which is fair I guess).

Two days later, it happened again. This time it was after a 25 mile drive from work and I stopped at a store to grab something and was in there for no more than 30 minutes. Same as before, the electronics came on, but nothing else happened. I tried getting a jump from somebody, which didn't work immediately, but eventually the car crank again after the other person revved their engine a few times. I took it to get a battery test right after and the battery was fine.

Everything had been fine until Saturday when it wouldn't start under very similar circumstances to the first two times. I turned the car off to go get coffee and waited inside for about 10 minutes. Once I got back in, it wouldn't start the first two or three times I turned the key, but the car started this time after a short wait.

TL;DR Car recently had work done and sometimes doesn't start after being cut off for a short time now. Wondering where to start diagnosing issues as far as the battery, starter (replaced about 10 months ago), connections, etc considering it's a ""sometimes"" issue",1,1728487521.0,AskMechanics,1,1.0,False

Preaching to the choir here, but here's a simple technique I do that shows us death's ability to positively impact our lives. 

With it, you'll:

- Have less regrets and stress
- More courage
- More presence, joy, humility 

The practice is called: the *Time Traveller's Technique*. Here's how it works:

1. Imagine yourself on your deathbed, replaying your life's memories.
2. See this exact moment as one of those memories you're revisiting. (Yes, you’re walking around inside a memory right now! 🥹)
3. Here's the twist: With this “lucidity” you’ve got a cosmic ""redo"" button!

Now, ask yourself: *""What do I want to bring to this moment?”* 

What would you have done *differently* in this memory?

💀 This is where the magic happens. Suddenly, you might find yourself:

- Wrapping your arms around your partner a little tighter.
- Kneeling down to embrace your dog as you scratch behind their ears.
- Pausing to feel the warmth of the sun on your face, grateful for another day on this beautiful, messy planet.

For me, it often brings a rush of emotion - a mix of gratitude, love, and a bittersweet appreciation for life's fleeting nature. I find myself tearing up at the beauty of existing, right here, right now.

The ordinary becomes extraordinary. That cup of coffee? It's not just a drink, it's a moment to savor. That chat with a friend? It's a chance to say ""I love you"" or ""I'm sorry"" or ""Thank you for being in my life.""

So, my dear death+ friends, I'm curious: if you could enhance this very moment, knowing it's part of your limited time here, what would you bring to it? What small act of love, kindness, or presence would you add?

>! Now get off your phone and go make the most of this memory! ❤️!<

I recently bought Hinge+ and have received about 15+ matches which have had varying results in the message game. I'm not new to dating apps at all and I'm pretty used to getting ghosted. But, with how many times I've been ghosted in the last two weeks I'm starting to think something is glitched. 

It started with a girl messaging me first about a picture, we sent two more texts back and forth with paragraph long responses and then no response.

The weirdest one happened about a week ago. We talked for a bit and I asked her about her favorite coffee shops saying that we should plan a date. She didn't respond until about a week later with a message that didn't even acknowledge mine asking how I have been and etc. It just felt like she double texted and never received the other message.

I also have an invisible match where it asks me to start the chat but I can't click on the match and there's no name or anything. I tried unmatching with it but it ended up unmatching with my top match which was unfortunate.

The reason I'm posting this is because I matched with a girl that I really hit it off with. Our conversation started so awkward and short but with some shared interests now we were sending paragraphs back and forth with emojis and sarcasm. I responded back to one of her long paragraphs with my response and then a few questions but she hasn't responded back in a few days. I know it's highly likely I just got ghosted, but with all these examples it feels like my messages just aren't going through.

Has anyone experienced this? I don't know if I should double text her or try to find her on social media. Are people ghosting that often and randomly or is Hinge a little messed up right now?",1,1728487294.0,dating,3,1.0,False

1fzts6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fzts6n/aita_for_unknowingly_leaving_coffee_drips_on_the/,AITA for unknowingly leaving coffee drips on the counter multiple times?,"My (40f) husband (53m) and I were having a disagreement the other day about me forgetting something else not related to this (I don't remember what now. I have ADHD as well as multiple other medical and mental health issues, a few of which cause problems with memory and/or brain fog so forgetting/misunderstanding is a daily occurrence in my life, in our lives. I know it bothers both of us.) when he angrily says something like 'of course you *forgot*... just like you don't remember spilling coffee on the counter?!' (he has often denied my disabilities, saying it's ""convenient"" what I forget... it's not. It really messes up my life, our life. He's also in other instances very caringly told me that of course I am disabled and knows I struggle... It's only in these fight modes that he'll throw everything at me.)

Anyway, he had mentioned a few weeks ago to ""please be careful when making coffee in the morning because you've left coffee on the counter"" and I was so confused because while yes, sometimes I will spill a few coffee grounds while I am making coffee, I have always been extremely careful to walk super slowly to the couch with my coffee cup in the morning even before he had said anything. It's been my routine for at LEAST 2 years. It's always right to the rim (due to the size of my tumbler and how I make it in the Keurig) and too hot to drink immediately so I slowly walk it to the couch. I've never spilled any liquid coffee and not wiped it. Since he mentioned it, I've even been extra careful to check after I'm finished making coffee and wipe up any stray coffee grounds too.

Then a few days ago, as he angrily mentions it, he asks if I want to ""see [his] phone"", to see the ""pictures"" as he's apparently been taking pictures of coffee drops on the counter for weeks instead of mentioning it in the moment as our marriage counselor recommends. I say no, I don't need to see pictures, just tell me WTF you're talking about?! I felt so lost. He knows that due to my PTSD I have a really difficult time with feeling like I'm in trouble, yet instead of calmly asking about it, letting me figure out what happened, it's always me getting yelled at.. and then blamed for the fight.

He brings me to the kitchen, yelling and pointing at a half inch spot on the counter in front of the microwave and through gritted teeth forcefully asks ""what's that?!"" implying coffee. I was like, 'I literally have no fucking clue what that is.' He says 'it's coffee!' I say, 'how? I don't even make my coffee over there.' I ask 'how do you even know that some random stain in front of the microwave is coffee and not some random thing made in the microwave?!'

This enrages him and he ends up licking his finger, wiping across the stain and licking again saying 'it's coffee!' Now, I'm not about to lick the nasty counter but he has also purposely lied to me before, many times so I definitely considered it. I insist again that 'I don't ever make coffee over there.' I attempt to point at where I do make coffee, on the other two counters. He doesn't care, just keeps yelling.

By this point our 20 year old son comes out of his room to see what is going on this time. I start to explain and my husband ends up walking out of the room. I tell my son what is happening and he ends up tasting the spot too. It is coffee. Now that I'm not being yelled at, I am able to think and it occurs to me that a few days before, during a flare, I set an iced Panera coffee there, leaned the cover over the edge held up by the straw, to put in some stevia drops and didn't notice the coffee drops on the counter when I walked back to the bedroom with it. 

Usually I will notice any drops and wipe them up, sometimes I intend to wipe them up but by the time I get around the corner to get a rag, I'm distracted by something there and forget. If I go back out to the kitchen and see it, I wipe it up at that point. I'm not intentionally leaving coffee on the counter.

I try to explain this to my husband but he accuses me of gaslighting him. Now the fact that he has LITERALLY gaslighted me (and compulsively lies to others too!) makes that infuriating to hear because I DO NOT LIE TO HIM. I DO NOT LIE IN GENERAL. Especially not about something as **ridiculous** as this. I simply didn't realize when he mentioned me ""making coffee in the morning"" a few weeks ago that he was actually mistaken and it was the coffees I get from Panera that were the culprit. Somehow my brain did not connect the two, despite them both being coffee... I believe now that's because he worded it ""while you're making coffee in the morning"" so that's what my brain focused on. I even asked him a few days after the first time he said anything a few weeks ago that I wondered if he actually meant coffee grounds because I'm always careful to walk super slowly to the couch, even demonstrating how ridiculously slowly I walk to the couch. That angered/frustrated him as well. Saying something about how he's not stupid and he knows the difference between coffee and coffee grounds.

I try to apologize but he's not having it. I try to explain but he's seething so I can't. I try asking my son what the big deal is anyway?! Why he cares SO MUCH about me dripping a little coffee when the rest of the counters (which are his job to clean but he never does) are disgusting on a daily basis, they're covered in everything from open butter wrappers with that miscolored butter 🧈, crumbs of all kinds, cereal pieces, etc. He doesn't wipe up my coffee spill and then the rest of the counter; Apparently he takes pictures of the coffee drips before wiping those and leaves everything else. I don't understand why it bothers him so much. That said, I have tried to be conscious of it for weeks and I don't believe I missed many times, maybe a couple times over the past few weeks, out of the 3x a day I go to Panera (free 3 months of sip club for the win!) 

Now we're back in the quiet phase of our relationship between these outbursts. He's not able to be talked with about it, to him these fights don't exist after the last of the yelling stops, so I'm asking you: AITA for not realizing there are coffee drips that I missed? Does the rest of the counter come into the equation at all? 


TL:DR: I'm not great at summarizing, if anyone has a better way to put this, let me know!

My husband is upset that I have spilled a drop or two of coffee on the counter several times without cleaning it. I didn't realize I had. He accused me of gaslighting him. I realized after he stopped yelling in my face that he was right, that I had dropped coffee, despite being aware of it bothering him a few weeks ago and trying to be careful not to drop anymore, or at least to wipe them up. It's not intentional. ",5,1728486830.0,AITAH,14,0.86,False

1fztp11,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1fztp11/dont_know_how_to_feel_about_my_work_situation_any/,"Don't know how to feel about my work situation, any ladies relate?","I've graduated from uni not too long ago, a bit over a year now, and have been working since. Currently, I work closely with this guy, who also joined the team around the same time as me, for a lot of projects. So my problem is, he almost always tries to finish most of the workload, if not, to really just do it himself entirely, without trying to split. 

In fact, I often have to ask, and kind of demand, to do something, and I feel really awful when I have to do that. The thing is, I like to fairly contribute to our projects and I am not an awful worker, and I am quite sure he knows that because a lot of times when he is stuck at something, I know the solution and shares it with him. But ultimately, he just likes to do it himself, especially the more technical stuff. 

I really tried to ask to do stuff whenever I can but I can feel his reluctance to share the workload. Honestly, I find it really frustrating because I will always think of making sure he gets to do something and fairly so whenever I get to the work first, and also, always make sure he is okay with it. And it really sucks because I wish he has the same consideration for me.

But I want to say that he is an incredibly nice person otherwise, and will even treat me coffee or other drinks from time to time. 

So I really don't know what to do, and I don't want to sour our relationship too, I just want to be able to do a fair amount of work. It's also not like I want to do as much work as I can, I know life is more than just work, but I seriously just want to be a fair contributor.

Anyone has similar experiences and tips on how to navigate this??

Also I know I put in the title that I am asking the ladies but guys can share their thoughts too! It's just that I have been reflecting on this; both of us are quite competent in doing the work we do and I don't know if maybe because I'm a girl and maybe guys sometimes just subconsciously want to be better than girls? I just can't think of the reasons why my colleague acts like that.",6,1728486606.0,askSingapore,11,1.0,False

Di ko mapo-post 'yung coffee, may kasama kasing puto bumbong. No outside food allowed daw. 

Yes, you read that right. As the name implies, they serve *toyo latte* — coffee + milk + toyo. Maglalasang salted caramel daw. 

**Hard pass**. I don't even like salted caramel, or that weird seasalt coffee either. So, hot Spanish latte pa rin at hindi ko nakain sa loob ang puto bumbong. Gutom na gutom pa naman ako non. Hinintay talaga ako ni ate na buklatin ang dahon ng saging, budburin ang ginayád na niyog, ipatulo 'yung condensada, at nag-blocking ng tasa at puto para kuhanan ng picture. Saka lang ako sabihan ni ate server sa gilid ko na bawal ang pagkain sa loob. 

Masarap naman ang kape. I may give that toyo latte a try next time na mag-grocery ulit nearby. Hindi ko kasi 'to alam datk, very popular na rin pala siya sa Biñan. Tagal ko nang nabababa sa bayan para mamili.

Their menu is tempting, and has competitive prices compared with specialty cafés and diners around the local.

Pleasing ng interior. Kahit maliit lang, na-elevate nila 'yung space with right choice of decor and color. Pwede ata puspin dito. Hindi nga lang siya recommended if you seek quiet place to read, study, or work here. Sa sobrang siksik ng tables, magkakatabi na kayo ng customers, rinig mo usapan talaga nila.

For $3.50 (hot, -50c for my own cup), the London Fog is an aromatic and creamy drink. I was honestly surprised by how similar it tastes to milk tea, but less sweet and a bit more on the citrusy side. I would also say that the tea flavor itself isn’t that strong, but compliments the milk well. I don’t usually have milk with my tea, but since I got a latte it had tea in it. It makes me want to see if theres other tea latte variations. I would love to try this cold some time, the hot version itself is wonderful. You get some foam on the top, and then the silky smooth tea after. I highly recommend this drink, It tastes wonderful during this weather. It’s also pretty ironic that it’s foggy as well.

She would send me a couple posts from the uni's page every once in a while and she went with me and mom when I went to pay the enrollment fees, but that's it.

When I went to pay the actual semester fees and make a schedule, the actual hard part, she told me and my parents that I had to depend on myself just like she had to when she first started uni. She told them she wanted someone to help her out but no one did so she was not going to help me. I did go alone and my dad just ordered a coffee and waited for me the whole time. I had to ask security guards where certain places where and I had to ask volunteers on what to do now and what to do next. Now I know this is the norm but why would I have to do all that when I have a sister that has been through this exact same thing? She would have saved me a lot of time. And, say she DID NOT WANT TO help me, that's fine by me, it's her choice and I respected it.

But today she offered to help me navigate the uni websites and all the online stuff, but I told her it's okay and that I'll learn alone just like she did. After all, this IS what she told me.

I didn't get why she said that but I assume she understood that I was jealous of how she was able to figure things out herself?? And it's not like I rejected her help rudely or anything, but she does have this habit of flipping out when things don't go the way she wants. Besides, she always has this condescending attitude towards me when she helps me, berating me for not knowing this or not having done that, so I would rather do that alone.

I just don't get it. She refuses to help me then she decides to help me then she gets angry when I save her the trouble then she calls me jealous. AITAH for rejecting her help?",3,1728485781.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Short Devotional about Generosity

Introduction
------------

Generosity is more than just giving; it’s a way of living that embodies kindness and selflessness. Imagine a world where generosity is the default setting—a place where people freely share their gifts, time, and resources, making the world around them a better place. Doesn’t that sound appealing? In this devotional, we will explore how embracing generosity can enrich our spiritual journey and impact those around us.

Generosity is infectious. When we give, we ignite a ripple effect of kindness, creating a community bonded by love and support. It challenges us to look beyond our own needs and desires, to invest in the happiness and well-being of others. Join us as we dive into the true meaning of generosity and discover how you can integrate it more deeply into your daily life.

Bible Verse
-----------

2 Corinthians 9:7 (NIV) – “Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”

Meaning
-------

The verse from 2 Corinthians reminds us that generosity should spring from the heart. It’s about intentionality and joy, not obligation. God is not concerned with how much we give, but rather the heart behind the action. Cheerful giving reflects trust in God’s provision and love for His people.

Generosity is a spiritual practice that transforms both the giver and the receiver. It shifts our mindset from scarcity to abundance, encouraging us to focus on what we have rather than what we lack. When we give generously, we acknowledge the blessings in our life and actively participate in God’s work on Earth.

Furthermore, generosity bears witness to our faith. It is a tangible expression of God’s love and grace in our lives. By freely giving of ourselves—whether it is our time, compassion, or resources—we become living examples of Jesus’s teachings.

Embracing a life of generosity doesn’t mean giving beyond our means or neglecting our own needs. It means being thoughtful and willing, trusting that even the smallest acts of giving can create monumental change. When we choose generosity, we open doors to divine opportunities for growth and connection.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Reflect on your resources and find one thing you can give to someone in need this week.

– Dedicate a portion of your time each month to volunteer at a local charity or community service event.

– Create a “gratitude jar” where you contribute a small amount whenever you feel thankful, to later donate to a cause you believe in.

– Practice small acts of kindness daily, such as offering a compliment, writing a thank-you note, or listening attentively.

– Set up a recurring donation to a cause or organization that resonates with your values and mission in life.

Q&amp;A about Generosity
------------------------

Certainly! Here’s a Q&amp;A based on the theme of generosity:

**Question 1: What is the definition of generosity?**

**Answer:** Generosity is the quality of being kind, understanding, and not selfish. It involves giving time, money, support, or resources to others out of the goodness of one’s heart without expecting something in return. Generosity is often viewed as a virtue and is closely associated with altruism, compassion, and empathy.

**Question 2: What are some ways to practice generosity in everyday life?**

**Answer:** Some ways to practice generosity include volunteering your time to a cause or community service, donating to charities or those in need, offering help or support to friends and family, sharing knowledge or skills, being an attentive listener, and performing random acts of kindness, such as paying for someone else’s coffee or offering a genuine compliment.

**Question 3: How does generosity impact mental health?**

**Answer:** Generosity can have a positive impact on mental health by fostering feelings of happiness, reducing stress, and promoting a sense of well-being and purpose. Engaging in acts of generosity can trigger the release of endorphins, often referred to as the “helper’s high,” and can also strengthen social bonds and improve relationships, contributing to overall emotional health.

**Question 4: What are the potential negative effects of being overly generous?**

**Answer:** While generosity is generally positive, being overly generous without setting boundaries can lead to potential negative effects such as burnout, financial strain, or being taken advantage of by others. It’s important to balance generosity with self-care and ensure that one’s own needs are also being met.

**Question 5: Can generosity be learned, or is it an innate trait?**

**Answer:** Generosity can be both an innate trait and a learned behavior. While some individuals may naturally have a more generous disposition, everyone can cultivate and practice generosity by developing empathy and actively engaging in acts of giving. Life experiences, cultural values, and role models can significantly influence one’s willingness to be generous.

**Question 6: How can generosity influence society as a whole?**

**Answer:** Generosity can positively influence society by fostering a culture of kindness and cooperation. It can help bridge social divides, reduce inequality, and contribute to the improvement of communities. Generous acts can inspire others to act similarly, creating a ripple effect that can lead to widespread social change and a more compassionate society.

Hey everyone,

Over the next couple of weeks, my family and a couple of friends are coming to visit, and I'm planning to take them to some great gastropubs - nothing too fancy, just somewhere they can enjoy proper British food. They'll be here for 8 days, and I'd like to take them to a new spot each day (preferably food-related).
I've been thinking about Borough Market, Spitalfields Market, or Mercato Mayfair. 
Also, is there anything in Chinatown that really stands out and isn't too pricey?

I'm also looking for some solid pub recommendations and maybe a nice coffee shop? I know a good one near Little Venice, but I'd love to hear if you have any favourites. And to top it all off, I'm considering a rooftop bar to end the week on a high note.

28 oz (US) of water for about a 4-5 cup yield (which is about the maximum my Gooseneck kettle holds)

About 24g of medium-coarse ground coffee with a tsp of water between each

2 1-minute hot blooms with ~92c water 

1 minute and 10 second first/main pour

45 sec to 1 minute subsequent pours

1fzt712,https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyCups/comments/1fzt712/the_inevitable_quencher_killer/,The inevitable Quencher Killer ,"Let me begin by saying that I have four Quenchers, three 40's and a 30. I do like them very, very much, never leave the house without one, and any complaint I have is constructive.

None of them fit car cupholders that well, even without a boot, and the top of the lid is a glare hazard when driving some days. Yeti is starting to make cups with ceramic lining, which is safer for acidic drinks. I have no doubt that some brand could come out with something superior to the quencher, and will also have the sense to offer them in colors and collabs.

Stanley itself is well positioned to improve its own design and already has practice collaborating. 

I suggest that a more graceful, less boxy shaped 32 ounce cup, that addresses the glare issue, has a slightly narrower base, comes with a perfectly coordinated boot that is flush with the cup, has a ceramic lining, uses something other than lead to seal the vacuum (which isn't a problem except for the paranoid), and still has tending patterns and collabs.

That  would be the Quencher Killer. There will someday be a Quencher Killer. Stanley should do it themselves. 

And from the get go Stanley should offer official charms and such for it. 

Stanley should be the one to do this before they're beat to it. 

I might also suggest a Stanley Keurig collab. Seasonal coffee mugs that fit perfectly under an instant brewer. And in colors my husband would carry, too. He has had his Stanley carafe for decades. 

These are my hot takes. What do you think?",0,1728485340.0,StanleyCups,5,0.29,False

Also grubbin as a potential mushroom farmer with ABB ingredients and then using aron as your coffee farmer with ABB as well. How bad/good is this set up??

Shinx is a bit easier i think, can be an all tomato farmer if you need, although we already have had many tomato farmers at our disposal already. Perhaps ABB is better if you need oil, which would be good for salads.

Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",12,1728485124.0,florida,0,0.88,False

Hey all, first time posting here. How many of you use the rpalvis water? I’ve been using it in my BDB for a few months. I’ve been trying to dial in some SO light roasts, but no matter what I do, all of my shots have a harsh acidity with no sweetness, and they all have a similar flavor/aroma from coffee to coffee. Could this be my water? Is the rpalvis water not as good at extracting coffee? Some things I’ve tried to increase extraction are grinding finer, doing blooming shots, turbo shots, increasing the temp, pulling high yields (1:4+) to no avail.

**Total Assets**: $1,487,955.39  **Total Debt**: $486,004.66



***Section Three: Income***

*Main Job Monthly Take Home*: Differs by a couple hundred dollars each month, but my last paycheck was $9,250.69. The differences are due to shift differentials. I have $2,910.26 in pre-tax deductions (retirement contributions, medical & dental insurance {I carry for my family} and work parking {annoyingly, we have to pay to park to come to work at the hospital}). I have $35.99 of post-tax deduction for voluntary short term disability buy up - this increases my STD pay to 60% of salary from 50%. Lastly, I have $4,333.40 of taxes.   

My husband has been doing locums work for \~18 months. He finished his last contract just before this trip and will be going back to a W2 job when we get back. He'll be making $207,000/year. He also gets a $45,000 sign-in bonus, paid out over 3 years. 



***Section Four: Travel Expenses***

*Pre-paid expenses*: 

* Flights (coach/direct) x 3: $2,379.30
* Airbnb São Paulo (6 nights): $994.51
* Airbnb beach (4 nights): $534.91
* New bag for me: $47.65
* New coloring book in Portuguese for my daughter: $14.99
* Brazil/US outlet plug converters (3): $12.99
* Yellow fever vaccine x3 (not covered by insurance): $781.41
* Travel-related medication for me: $5
* Portable travel booster seat for H: $34.19
* Pre-paid airport parking (5% discount with pre-booking): $240

*Pre-paid Total:* ***$5,044.95***

Note: 1 Brazilian real = 18¢ US | 1 USD = R$ 5.48. We mostly paid with credit, so we see the charges in USD + foreign transaction fee. We used some cash, in which case I'll note both currencies. 

**Day 1, Saturday**:

We don't actually start packing until today, so we spend most of the morning on that. H has been back in school for two weeks, so naturally her nose is running now. We run to the drug store for those little packs of travel tissues and grab a new chapstick, razors, & a travel pack of ibuprofen while we're there (*$20.33*). Hang out with my siblings and parents for awhile and then head to the airport mid-afternoon. It's a \~2 hour drive. We stop once about 15 minutes out from the airport for dinner. Two kebab platters, drinks, and baklava at this Afghan place are all delicious (*$54.55*). 

Get to the airport. Security is easy. We're pretty early, so S & H wander around. I stay at the gate because I irrationally feel the need to keep it in eyeshot once I'm at the airport. For some reason, there are 3 adjacent gates, sharing very limited seating, all with large international flights taking off within 15 minutes of each other. Everyone is on top of each other, the lines all criss-cross, and I do not love it. We board and take off on time. A 1030pm flight isn't my first choice with a small human, but it's the only direct flight, so hopefully it's worth it.

*Day 1 Total: $74.88*



**Day 2, Sunday*****:***

H ends up sleeping about 6 hours on the flight - not too shabby. I sleep zero - very shabby. We land in São Paulo a little early. Customs is quick, which is definitely a perk of traveling with a small child! V & T are waiting for us (inside the airport, wild) and drive us to our Airbnb. H falls back asleep on the drive, though São Paulo’s “legendary traffic” isn't too terrible on Sunday morning. Get to the Airbnb; it's in this combo rental units/co-working building. Some people live there I think, but most are short stay. We enter and exit the building with facial recognition! 

H & I shower while S runs to a nearby grocery store & cafe. He brings back a big jug of water, fruit, bread, cheese, cookies, and charcuterie type meat (*$71.45*) and coffees (*$5.77*). We have a snack lunch. I feel terrible from the lack of sleep, so I lay down for about 2 hours while S&H hit up some playgrounds nearby. 

I rally to walk to dinner at [Consulado da Bahia](https://www.consuladodabahia.com.br/). It is Brazilian food from the Bahia region. Everything is amazing and served family style. We get pastels and a platter with beef, rice, bananas, and beans (*$62.79*). H falls asleep on me after pastels, which are one of her favorites, but also rallies on the walk home when she spies ice cream (*$3.79*). 

Sleep immediately when we get back. 

*Day 2 Total: $143.80*



**Day 3, Monday:**

Today is essentially our first day of touristing; unfortunately it's raining so we pivot to an indoor morning. We start with pastries, [pão de queijo](https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A3o_de_queijo) (another one of H’s favorites), & coffee at a little [cafe](https://www.instagram.com/fazemos.pao?igsh=c3d4ZXY1eXc0YjUx) near us (*$14.65*). We then walk to a metro stop near us and take it (R$10 = *$1.83*) to visit the [Pinacoteca](https://pinacoteca.org.br/) Museums (R$60 = *$10.99*). We also check out the cool old [Luz train station](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/120-years-of-luz-station-museu-da-lingua-portuguesa/RAURhHm2wnzb1g?hl=en) and find some murals. 

We then take the metro (R$10 = *$1.83*) to the Liberdade neighborhood, which is São Paulo's Japantown. A couple restaurants we were hoping to try were closed on Mondays, so, counter-intuitively, we end up at a Chinese restaurant called [Rong He](https://ronghe.com.br/). Luckily the kind people at the next table conveyed to us via gestures that this place too was family style before we ordered way too much. H picked a beef noodle soup for us, and we also ordered some dumplings (*$22.37*). I gathered from the other diners’ tables that the soups were the house specialties, so we were pleased with our choices - delicious and still way too much food! 

We then wander back through the shops of Liberdade and find some more murals. S&H get snacks from a small Japanese grocery store - mochi, cookies, and candies (*$10.83*). 

We walk up to the beautiful [Sé Cathedral](https://arquisp.org.br/regiaose/paroquias/mosteiros-igrejas-historicas-oratorios-da-regiao-se/catedral-metropolitana-nossa-senhora-assuncao-e-sao-paulo-se) and spy a few more murals. (I travel for street art and food.) We then take the metro (R$10 = *$1.83*) back to our apartment. Shower and relax for a bit, then coordinate with V&T to meet for dinner. The five of us go to [Taberna 474](https://www.taberna474.com.br/), an upscale seafood restaurant near us. Two glasses of wine, three sodas, two appetizers, the entrees, and three desserts for the five of us (*$179.12*). I got a ceviche, S got a poached cod that V tells us is a traditional special occasion preparation, H got this shrimp and tomato-y rice dish that reminded me of a risotto, and V&T shared a whole fish. Everything was delicious!

Walk “home,” bed.

*Day 3 Total: $228.80*



**Day 4, Tuesday:**

We wake up and take the metro (R$10 = *$1.83*) to meet V&T at [Villa Lobos Park](https://www.parquevillalobos.net/). We eat breakfast, (coffees, pão de queijo, açai bowls), at the cafe in the library (*$23.29*). We explore and read in the children's section of the library for awhile, then wander around the park and play at the playground. 

We take the metro (R$10 = *$1.83*) back towards Pinheiros and then walk to [Beco de Batman](https://www.instagram.com/becodobatman.oficial?igsh=MTd0ZXBudW04dDdicQ==), an area with many murals. We walked around awhile, taking a bunch of pictures of the beautiful murals. S&H get ice cream (*$9.10*), and we buy a small painting (R$ 250 = *$45.30*) from a street vendor, who we then realized had also painted some of the murals! 

My daughter is tired and whiny, so we head back to the apartment, and she takes a nap. We're supposed to go to V's favorite restaurant with some of her family for dinner, but at the last minute, she realizes it's not open for dinner tonight! She's pretty disappointed. However, the place we went Sunday night has a fish that she's been craving since she got back to Brazil, so we end up going back there. While waiting for them, we browse a nearby [bookstore](https://www.travessa.com.br/) and buy some children’s books & a tote bag (*$50.41*). Back at the restaurant, the five of us share a huge [moqueca](https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moqueca) with the fish V picked, pastels, and bananas. S gets two beers, I get a passion fruit [caipirinha](https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha), and the others get sodas (*$99.83*). Again, everything is delicious. 

*Day 4 Total: $231.59*



**Day 5, Wednesday:**

We wake up, eat some fruit, and then walk back to the same cafe we went to Monday morning for coffee, pão de queijo, & pastries again (*$17.57*). Our attempts at ordering in Portuguese weren't as good today: I was trying to order the croissant with gruyere in it, but by saying “croissant com queijo” (croissant with cheese), I actually end up with a plain croissant, sliced, with a slice of cheese melted inside. We also intend to order one pão de queijo, but get several. Ah well, it's not like we won't eat it!

We walk/Metro it (R$10 = *$1.83*) to [São Bento monastery](https://www.mosteirodesaobentosp.com.br/). It's beautiful, but we over-allotted time to spend there and end up walking through some crazy busy shopping/street vendor streets for awhile. H picks out a pack of stickers in a shop (*$3.28*). More beautiful murals. 

We then meet V&T at [Mercado Municipal Paulistano](https://www.mercadomunicipalsp.com/en/home/) for lunch. We get these (apparently famous) mortadella sandwiches at [Bar do Mané](https://bardomane.com.br/), along with pastels and sodas (*$35.94*). After lunch, we explore the market stalls, tasting some fruit (Did you know that a cashew grows attached to a huge piece of fruit? And you can slurp the cashew fruit juice??), and buying some peppers I like (*$4.56*) and candy for H (*$2.19*).

Next, we walk to the [Catavento museum](https://museucatavento.org.br/), which is a kids science museum. H loves it and somehow it's only *$13.14* for the five of us all to enter? I'm not sure we paid correctly in retrospect. Spend all afternoon there and then walk/Metro “home” (R$10 = *$1.83*). 

We eat leftovers for dinner and still don't finish them. H&S go get ice cream (*$6.57*) again while I take a long shower. Before bed, H & I make and send an Inkcard postcard to her classmates at home (*$2.12*) and go to bed at a reasonable hour. 

*Day 5 Total: $89.03*



***Day 6, Thursday:***

We get going a little more slowly today. S goes back to the grocery store to restock us with jugs of water and fruit, plus two bottles of wine to bring to V's aunt, who is having us over for dinner tonight (*$86.21*). 

We walk to [Padoca de Maní](https://www.padocadomani.com.br/) for brunch. I got the ‘green sandwich,’ S got an egg sandwich, H got pão de queijo (of course) + coffees *($39.14).* The green sandwich had avocado, pesto, and a big chunk of mozzarella on a multi-grain bread, and I think I’ve found my new favorite breakfast! We then walk around the fancy neighborhood of Jardim Paulistano, hit up some playgrounds, and peek in a [really cool church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igreja_Nossa_Senhora_do_Brasil) with constellations painted on the ceiling. 

We go back “home” so H can take a nap, knowing we'll be out late tonight. S walks to pick up our rental car for the latter part of the trip (*$453.82*, some of which should be refunded pending tolls/gas). He brings it back and ends up paying to park in the Airbnb building garage for the next few days. It's supposed to be included with the Airbnb rental, but we can't convey that effectively through the language barrier to the parking attendant and end up just paying for it (*$16.69*). 

We then venture out into São Paulo rush hour traffic to drive to the neighborhood where V’s aunt lives/V is from. It’s about nine miles, but it takes us at least an hour. Shout out to my husband who safely drives us there! We visit and have dinner with V, T, T’s aunt and mom, V’s aunt, uncle, sister, and cousins all evening and have a wonderful time. Drive back to our place around 11, which is way past H’s bedtime, and takes about a third of the time. Bed.

*Day 6 Total: $595.86*



***Day 7, Friday:*** 

Another slow wakeup. Get going for [fancy croissants](https://www.mintchi.com.br/) and coffee - I get a pistachio one, so good (*$15.39*). H continues her dedication to a morning pão de queijo, so we grab that too (*$1.58*). We take the metro (R$10 = *$1.83*) to Paulista Ave and walk to Trianon Park. There’s a playground, of course, and we walk around the park awhile. It feels like being inside a little slice of rainforest, smack dab in the middle of the city! We ID some birds, using the Merlin app, AND I spy a monkey! We then hear a noise, reminding us that we are in fact in the middle of a huge city, and go hunting. It’s a working pile driver - don’t know if anyone else has a construction vehicle obsessed child, but this is an exciting and less common sighting! We watch it work for a good 30 minutes. 

We walk back up to Paulista, spy some good murals, and get a small lunch at [Hakka Sushi ](https://www.hakkasushi.com.br/home/)- 3 simple rolls, edamame, and drinks (*$29.56*). We browse some street vendors and each pick out a magnet to take home (R$20 = *$3.66*). Metro (R$10 = *$1.83*) back ‘home,’ stopping for some ice cream on the way ($10.01). We make H take a nap again, as we have another late night ahead. 

We walk to Maní ahead of our reservation. This is H’s first “fancy dinner,” aka fine dining experience. Maní has a Michelin star and is on the Latin American 50 Best Restaurants list. We have a great meal, and H does SO well. We’re very proud that she tries everything and swallows one thing that she didn’t like and clearly wanted to spit out (*$312.61*). We walk out after dinner and discover that it’s pouring, so get an uber (*$4.82*) back ‘home.’

*Day 7 Total: $381.29*



***Day 8, Saturday:*** 

Wedding day! We pack up, with pão de queijo and coffees (*$8.96*). Drive about an hour east of São Paulo proper to the wedding venue. Wedding is beautiful and fun, and we’re there most of the afternoon. Afterwards, we drive another 90 minutes or so to the beach town where we’re staying the next few days. Check out our very cool little house, unpack, shower, and bed. 

*Day 8 Total: $8.96*



***Day 9, Sunday:*** 

S gets up and drives to the grocery store for pão de queijo, water, fruit, cheese, sausages, yogurt, bread, coffee, shampoo, soap, snacks, and soda (*$88.06*). We eat breakfast leisurely and hang out in our cool tropical backyard. Eventually, we get dressed and drive to a small shopping area, looking for a few items for the beach. We get two towels (*$11.29*), which were surprisingly hard to find, and some classic Havianas flip flops for H & I (*$24.03*). 

We change and walk down to the beach. Eventually, the rest of the group (V, T, T’s mom & aunt, V’s sister, aunt, & cousin) joins us. We buy lunch for everyone to share from one of the beachside vendors - big platters of fried fish, french fries, pastels, and drinks (*$73.49*). 

We decide we’ll cook dinner at our house together tonight, so S runs back to the store for a big piece of meat to grill, some veggies, charcoal, and wine (*$87.33*). S and V’s sister work the grill, while V’s aunt and cousin make rice and veggies. We have a great time eating, drinking, and hanging out in our backyard. 

*Day 8 Total: $284.20*



***Day 9, Monday:*** 

We stick with our slow beach wakeups. Make it out mid-morning and meet the rest of the group. They buy lunch this time, very similar to yesterday. I buy a canga from a beachfront vendor (*R$50 = $9.15*). The rest of the group have to head back to Sao Paulo this afternoon, so we have leftovers for dinner, just the three of us.

*Day 9 Total: $9.15*



***Day 10, Tuesday:*** 

Our last day at the beach. It’s rainy in the morning, so we hang out at the house, do a lot of coloring and watch some tv. It stops for us to head to the beach around lunchtime, bringing sandwiches we made with us. We collect a lot of shells. For dinner, we finish up the leftovers and random odds & ends.

*Day 10 Total: $0*



***Day 11, Wednesday*****:**

Heading home today! We eat our last pieces of fruit and pack up. The plan is to stop for pão de queijo on our way out of town, but we end up having to wait an hour to hand off the key to the AirBNB and miss the chance. H & I walk to say goodbye to the beach while we wait. Then drive back to São Paulo. I'm not a very anxious person generally, but driving up over these mountains is making me a little white-knuckled. 

We meet the others for lunch at [Imperio da Costela](https://imperiodacostela.com.br/), V’s favorite restaurant that we weren’t able to go to the other night. Their specialty is ribs, which are served family style, along with a variety of sides. We eat a ton since we didn’t have too much in the way of breakfast; we split this bill and the portion for the three of us is *$37.51*. We follow lunch up with one more ice cream stop (*$10.09)*.

We head to the airport after lunch and this time we definitely experience that legendary São Paulo traffic. Return the rental car, get through security, find our gate, etc. S & H go wandering while I lounge, per usual. We get a variety of snacks and bottles of water for the plane (*$23.32*). Flight is uneventful, minus my lack of sleep again. I rewatch some Harry Potter movies and rue my inability to fall asleep. 

*Day 11 Total: $70.92*



**TOTAL Total: $7,163.70**

**Transportation Total: $3,109.27**

**Accommodations Total: $1,529.42** 

**Food Total: $1,351.20**

**Shopping Total: $147.12**



***Section Five: How You Afforded the Trip:***

This trip has been in the works for more than a year. I've had a savings category in my YNAB budget for about that long. I actually overestimated; we came in a little under budget. We got super lucky with our airfare. My husband had a Google flights alert set on the flight we wanted, and we'd almost resigned ourselves that the price wouldn't change from the \~$1500 where it'd been sitting. Then, for less than 24 hours, the price dropped by more than half! We swooped all 5 tickets then and were very proud of our Internet-ing skills. (We bought V&T's airfare as their wedding gift. I didn't include it up with our flights in pre-paid expenses, because to me it falls under a gift category, not this trip.) The next day, the tickets were back to $1500 each.

Where do I even start? This year has been hell. Failed IVF at the beginning. My contract for work got extended instead of converting to permanent. Dislocated my knee in my sleep, then a month later got into a car accident. My car was totaled and my body was further injured. I can’t move much and I have horrible pain. Ok, that’s fine. Then I developed a pulmonary embolism. It hurts too. But cool, I caught it and I’m alive. My knee needs surgery but my PE makes it risky. Then my job which was supposed to convert full time next year cut my contract short. My last day is end of the month and I’m devastated because actually the company is amazing and my coworkers are so kind. But I can’t help but feel like the prospect of hiring a cripple who needs surgery and time off made their budget department balk. I can’t do anything for myself really. I can’t drive, need help up and down stairs, can’t clean or cook because standing hurts. I’ve gained 30 pounds since my accident. I hate my body. I feel nauseated looking at myself. 

I’m married. I thought my husband was amazing. He is an addict. I left him and he got clean. We reconnected and it’s been amazing since. No more manic outbursts, no more violence. I was with him 6 years while he fought these demons. I lost family and friends. But I stayed because I honestly thought he’d die if I didn’t and I can’t live with myself knowing if I left he’d die. When I finally left after his last commitment he flew home to his family so I felt safe. I moved on. All of this background to say yesterday he acted off. A bit manic. I looked at him and asked what he was on and he brought my some THC gummies. His mother is coming tomorrow, an unrelated visit, doesn’t know that he used again. And I didn’t even yell at him. I just stared into space for an hour trying to control my panic so I didn’t faint. He started cleaning the house and just stopped speaking. He won’t say a word. He whimpers and cries but won’t speak. It’s weird and frustrating and manipulative. I’m at my wits end here. Do I send him home? Do I tell his family? I can’t do anything for myself so then what? I don’t have family here I live in the middle of nowhere and can’t drive myself to appointments. I have dogs. I can’t bend to pick up their poop. I understand the stress he must be under with me being sick and crippled. But I’ve checked in many times. I have done everything to stay positive when deep down I just want it to be over already. But I kept living because I have a family that needs me and we’re going to live happily ever after. But now it’s all fucked up and what am I here for? He’s normal today besides the not talking thing. Do I just let it go and know that deep down another crisis will happen. Do I move to my parents. Do I just cease to exist. I’m lost. I’m not asking anyone here these questions I’m just asking myself. Just getting all this off my chest because I feel like I’m at rock bottom. 

I have to be on blood thinners forever now. I can’t walk right. I don’t find joy. I can’t afford therapy. Or tbh I just don’t think I’d want to say all this to a therapist because they’d commit me. I’m not suicidal because I don’t have a plan. I just pray every night not to wake up. And then I do.

Living and taking care of others while sacrificing anything I cared about to make sure the other person was ok. And I don’t regret that because I believe we all sacrifice for our loved ones and that’s love. But I just want one year or one month where I am happy. I don’t even know what happiness is anymore.

1fzshwa,https://i.redd.it/b04mnu3uoqtd1.jpeg,Top Reasons for Composite Filling Failure and How to Fix Them,"

1. Post-Operative Sensitivity
One of the most common complaints after getting a composite filling, especially in Class II or V cases.

Causes:

Leakage

Over-drying the dentin

Polymerization shrinkage


Solution:
When applying the etch, make sure it's rinsed well and dried properly. The key is to dry it to ""moist dry"" – not completely dry. If over-dried, the dentinal tubules collapse, preventing proper bonding later. You may need to replace the filling or repair it correctly.




---

2. Recurrent Caries
New decay forming after a filling can happen due to several reasons.

Causes:

Not removing all the decay before placing the composite

Shrinkage that leads to leakage and bacteria sneaking in

Rough surface due to improper finishing and polishing, making it a haven for bacteria


Solution:
Remove the old composite, clean out any new decay, and replace it with a properly placed composite.




---

3. Discoloration
Aesthetic issues can arise if the composite changes color over time.

Causes:

Wrong shade selection from the start

Smoking or excessive tea/coffee intake staining the composite

Poor finishing and polishing


Solution:
Depending on the extent of discoloration, you may need resurfacing, veneering, or even a total replacement.




---

4. Dislodgement of the Filling
Sometimes, the filling just falls out.

Causes:

Poor bonding due to improper technique or curing

Inadequate isolation during the procedure


Solution:
Replace the filling.




---

5. Gross Fracture
Composite is brittle and has low flexural strength, which can lead to fractures.

Causes:

Improper application in the cavity or voids present during placement


Solution:
Replace the filling or attempt to repair it, if possible.

The covers protect our seats from dirt, UV rays, pet hair, and food spill.

A car seat cover is a piece of accessory used to protect the car seats against any form of damage. Additionally, some people also use it as a part of interior styling. These covers keep the seat condition intact and help you maintain the resale value of your car.

  


# Why Do People Buy Car Seat Covers?

There are several reasons people buy car seat covers.

**Spillage**: Spillage is the most common danger for any car seat. Whether it’s food, coffee, drinks, or just water, they can easily ruin your polished factory seat in a matter of seconds.

**Rip/ Cut Protection**: As comfortable as car seats are, they are not very famous in terms of durability. Keyrings, pocket knives, or anything with sharp corners can scratch your seat.

**Low Maintenance**: Seat covers are pretty low maintenance stuff compared to the actual seat. You don’t have to clean them as often, and they don’t leave you with a seat replacement bill.

  


# How to Choose?

**Water Spill**: Water spill is one of the most common reasons that can ruin your precious leather seats. So, get a seat cover that will deflect water and be machine washable. Neoprene seat covers perform very well against water.

**Cloth Seat Cover**: We usually clean the inside of our car with a vacuum. Therefore, look for cloth seat covers with a higher thread count as they provide better protection against daily vacuum cleaning and accidental cuts.

**Comfortability**: Comfortability should be a key characteristic of any good seat cover. Choose a seat cover that has thick foam padding and good breathability.

**Exact Size**: Make sure the cover you are choosing fits well with your seat. Don’t go for loose-fitting as loose covers rub more against the seat, which can ruin your seat cover.

**Trendy Design**: Always remember that a seat cover can reflect your style. So if you are after the look, go for those color options that offer different materials and color choices.

**Ring of Fire**

*David Lynch Keeps his End of the Bargain*

By Steve Erickson for LA Weekly, September 11 – September 17, 1992

  
This week, in commemoration of both the beginning of autumn — the season of madness — and the release of John Cassavetes’ *A Woman Under the Influence* on video, I was going to invite you all to the First Annual Mabel Longhetti Film Festival, a do-it-yourself VCR marathon of Movies About How Love Makes You Crazy. But sitting in a theater a few days ago, a third of the way through David Lynch’s new *Twin Peaks – Fire Walk With Me*, I knew I was going to have to forget the Mabel Longhetti Festival for the time being, maybe until Valentine’s Day. ""Bob"" had just made an early appearance in Laura Palmer’s bedroom, lurking behind the dresser where her diary was hidden. Those of you familiar with the TV series know that it was the body of Laura Palmer, teenage sweetheart (in more ways than one) of the town of Twin Peaks, that washed up on the banks of the river in the first episode’s opening minutes, and that Bob is the utterly evil incarnation of Laura’s father Leland. For the first 40 minutes of the movie the audience had been laughing wearily because we were supposed to, the way all of us who followed the TV show laughed at the coffee jokes and pie jokes and log lady jokes long after they stopped being funny and became affectations. But now Bob’s appearance was greeted by cries unlike any I’ve ever heard in a theater. They weren’t the good-natured shrieks of people getting a thrill from being scared, rather they were like the scream of someone who’s just awakened from a soul-rending nightmare, the undercurrents of which no amount of daylight will ever completely revoke. There was nothing graphic or gross about the scene, just the sight of Bob which sent a tremor through the audience, and after that we didn’t laugh much anymore as the movie rapidly narrowed our options to two: stay on its own terms or leave.

I certainly didn’t expect to be writing about a movie that was already universally reviled before it ever opened, and may or may not still be in theaters by the time you read this. Two years after the TV show took the zeitgeist by storm and David Lynch was being hailed as a genius on the cover of *Time*, a year after his *Wild at Heart* won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, the new film was savagely booed at this year’s festival, and there were reports people had trouble eating their dinner afterward. *Twin Peaks*’ distribution studio slipped it into American theaters without a single press screening, as though hoping no one would notice except the cult who would buy a weekend’s worth of tickets before the bad news got out. It’s the ultimate ruthlessness of a what-has-he-done-lately culture that one year’s so-called genius is next year’s object of contempt. We should be clear about several things: I’m not an unabashed David Lynch fan by any means. I thought *Blue Velvet* was an important film but an alarmingly uneven one; and that I always liked *The Elephant Man* the best of Lynch’s features is probably indicative of what I’ve never liked about him at all, appreciating his most conservative, mainstream work for the way it turned out to be an aberration rather than characteristic. There are many ways in which *Twin Peaks – Fire Walk With Me* is a failure. On more than one occasion it’s flat-out bad. The first half-hour is Lynch at his worst, somehow enervated and frantic at the same time, nakedly contrived to work into the movie Kyle MacLachlan’s Agent Cooper as well as a swarm of irritating cameos by Harry Dean Stanton and Chris Isaak and David Bowie and Kiefer Sutherland, and in the meantime cluttering everything with the sort of extraneous weirdness and sophomoric symbolism Lynch loves.

But when *Twin Peaks – Fire Walk With Me* moves to the town of Twin Peaks itself, and into the last week of Laura Palmer’s life, its hallucinations are lit by the flame and shadow of its own abyss. “We live inside a dream,” someone can be heard whispering over the soundtrack; and, particularly in its final images, the film defies the intimidations of narrative to speak in the dream language that movies can approximate like no other art if they have the imagination or nerve for it. Lynch opens the new film with a fit metaphor: an ethereal blue haze that eventually reveals itself as a TV screen after all the programming has gone off the air. A second later it explodes to a woman’s scream and the thud of a fatal blow, and not unlike our journey into *Blue Velvet*’s severed ear, it’s as if we’re following Laura Palmer’s spiritual descent into the hole of the dead monitor, where we’ll see things the TV series could only hint at. We always knew Laura was a wild girl, the homecoming femme fatale who was crazy for cocaine and fucked roadhouse drunks less for the money than the sheer depravity of it, but the movie is finally not so much interested in the titillation of that depravity as her torment, depicted in a performance by Sheryl Lee so vixenish and demonic it’s hard to know whether it’s terrible or a tour de force. Her fit of the giggles over the body of a man whose head has just been blown off might be an act of innocence or damnation or both. Ray Wise as Leland Palmer, who wound up stealing the series, continues his unsettling impression of a man inhabited by evil: you can see Bob slip into him and slip out, leaving him a shambles in the process. In a scene between Laura and Leland in a car, which is acted and directed at such a full throttle it either represents astonishing courage or a complete leave of senses by all involved, both daughter and father seethe the red of sex and fire until you expect to see smoke pour out of both of them. Where the pitch of the TV show was grief laced with black whimsy, here it’s hysteria chafing against delirium, before it succumbs to the visual hush of Laura’s final deliverance.

The result of all this is one of the most remarkable and disturbingly authentic pieces of American surrealism the movies have produced in memory. The subversive — and also quintessentially American — thing about Lynch isn’t his hipness but how genuinely square he is; this is why the ""funny"" visual non sequiturs of his movies can seem infantile, because like most Americans he doesn’t really believe in irony. A kiss always hovers between the forbidden and the squalid. Sex and pleasure are always the defilers of love rather than the expression of it. Donna Hayward, Laura’s best friend (disconcertingly played here by Moira Kelly rather than the series’ Lara Flynn Boyle, whose reserve so bordered on regality the contrast with Laura Palmer was all the more striking), speaks for Lynch’s romantic ideal: she’s fascinated and repelled by Laura, slumming in Laura’s nightlife and thinking she can return by dawn unscathed. But neither Laura nor Lynch believes you come back from such a night unscathed. Even Laura, already on the far side of the point of no return, believes that once the ideal of love becomes sullied, all hell breaks loose and moral collapse is inevitable: fall into Lynch's inferno and you’re likely to do something really terrible, like take your clothes off to loud music, which naturally leads to mutilation, death and sleeping with your father. When Bob leaves his clues under the fingernails of his victims, it’s no accident he chooses the wedding-ring finger. When Donna asks whether you slow down or speed up when you’re falling in space, Laura answers that you fall faster and faster until you catch on fire, at which point all your angels desert you.

“I don't want to see this picture,” said a friend of mine who was a fan of the show until the series’ finale, when like many people he recoiled both from the spiritual tedium and the show’s deliberate corruption of its own ideals: “I don’t want all that stuff in my head.” And to anyone who feels that way, I wouldn’t advise seeing the movie either, nor can I recommend it to anyone who hasn’t seen the series because I don’t think it will make two seconds of sense to them. But there’s no denying that *Twin Peaks – Fire Walk With Me* is a filmmaker’s reckless plummet into his own creative maelstrom, where his revelry in the TV medium which perversely inspired him to go farther than he’d ever gone before must finally smash the limits of that medium, which wouldn’t or couldn’t let him complete the journey. In conceptual terms the movie is ostensibly a prequel to the TV show but it’s really not that literal: everything in the movie that’s supposedly happening “before” what happened in the series is actually informed by everything that came at the end of it; in the film, the dream of the series is caught in a time loop. The soft spooky naturalism of Ron Garcia’s photography in the TV show’s pilot is here saturated by Garcia with a kind of electric unreality, new details surfacing through the veneer of a small town’s naïveté that strangles the life out of Laura and is in turn corroded by her murder. The girl’s room at the high school is shrouded in an icy ether, where the rituals of co-eds putting on lipstick become terrifyingly exotic, and a black wreath in the shape of a broken heart hangs unexplained on the Palmers’ front door, as though someone has already died. And while it’s hard for me to be sure without seeing the show again, the interiors of the Palmer house look diminished, if not to the scale of dwarves then slightly claustrophobic all the same, the ceilings a little lower and the doors a little smaller, imperceptibly closing in on an American family that’s about to explode.

The spinelessness of our culture is breathtaking. We’re happy to call someone a genius, and to celebrate that genius when all it means is some kind of kooky eccentricity that won’t get in the way of whatever else we’re doing. But when that genius insists on its own dark audacity, when it not only overstays its welcome but moves in with all its bizarre habits, then we smuggle the new movie through town in the dead of night like transporting radioactive waste to the nuclear dump, because whatever else we want from our culture, we don’t want consequences. It’s one thing to reject *Twin Peaks – Fire Walk With Me* because we don’t want this film inside our heads — that’s an honest, perhaps even healthy reaction — but it’s another to pretend that Lynch has somehow betrayed us or himself when in fact he’s done neither, when in fact of all of his films this may be the one where he pursues farther than ever before what he’s about as an artist. Whatever else is true of *Twin Peaks – Fire Walk With Me*, people are ultimately appalled not by its badness but its integrity; in the theater I could feel everyone around me pulling away from the movie and I knew why, because I wanted to get away from it as well. You can feel the industry and the critics and the audience all breathe a sigh of conspiratorial relief that we’ve got *that* guy out of our hair once and for all; we might even feel gratitude for how he played into our hands, if we weren’t so busy slapping him down with them. Ultimately we may decide that Lynch is too uncontrolled or puerile or sick to deal with, but let’s not pretend he didn’t give us fair warning or that the failure of nerves is anyone’s but our own. In the end *Twin Peaks*, both the TV series and the movie, is the work of David Lynch’s life not because it’s a solemn act of artistic maturity but because it’s the wild magnum opus of a primal adolescence that none of us outgrows, and we hate him for that, *Time* cover or no. We hate him not only for how he’s kept his end of the bargain but for how we’ve failed to keep ours — how, moreover, we deliberately chose to misunderstand the bargain all along.",11,1728483377.0,blankies,2,1.0,False

He's my best friend, we live together now, we share the same friend group, and we enjoy similar hobbies. Overall, things are great! So this is really just a minor snag.

TLDR: My bf says I hate him as a trending joke and it makes me feel upset. AIO?

As the title says, there's a trend going around where SO's will say ""You hate me"" or ""Why do you hate me"" as a joke after not getting their needs met in the moment. These are meant to be very unserious and exaggerated, but I'm more of a sensitive person so hearing this always makes me a bit sad. With words of affirmation being one of my top love languages, I don't love hearing that I hate him. After letting him play the bit out a few times, I let him know that I don't like the joke and he reassured me then. But he keeps doing it. For example, this morning he asked me to make coffee and I told him I couldn't because I had to get ready first. So he said ""You hate me"" again before giving me a kiss on the cheek. I jokingly whined about it bothering me and we moved on with our morning. In hindsight, I probably should've been straightforward right then and there, but I didn't want a bad start to our day. 

I don't want to be such a party pooper, but it's a joke that I don't find very funny. Not to mention, we've already had a conversation about it and how it affects me. We do joke a lot, and he reassures me with a kiss or hug now when he makes the joke, so I don't know. Am I just overreacting?",2,1728483357.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

1fzsfkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1fzsfkr/please_call_if_found/,Please Call If Found,"In the woods behind her house sat a pile of logs, perhaps trees that fell down or part of the old mill that was there years before. They played there as kids, running down the creek nearby, playing hide and seek. The group consisted of six, Kadie, Jessica, Colby, Keane, Calvin and Louise. Playing hide and seek became an after school tradition. Even if one of them couldn't make it, the game continued. They'd laugh and scream and all together have a great time, they were kids after all. They did this for years. Even some evenings take food and blankets to sit and eat and tell stories. Little woven picnic blankets sat in the grass at the bottom of the grass hill near the creek. When the food was finished they packed up and hid their stuff under the closest tree to the bridge to be able to come back at the end of the games. Then it all came to a stop the day she wasn't found. 

Kadie lost her way in the evening of Friday 7th November 2014, she was 12 at the time but had been playing in these woods for years. Stumbling blindly in the woods, tripping over logs and roots. Kadie felt meaningless under a sky of stars and falling leaves, she'd pick up sticks that Winnie would have liked and throw them as if to play fetch with the dog that wasn't there. She would wander following the North Star like her dad had taught her to do when they used to go camping *‘The North Star will always guide you home, honey’* she remembered his voice in her head. She’d look up to find the star every few minutes to make sure she was still walking in the correct direction. The woods got denser and the ground more soft. Her shoes started to stick to the floor and the leaves covered the sky. Kadie was lost, she knew it now. Cold and alone in the trees by her house with no hope of getting back.

Hide and seek was fruitless now, she would never be found. She and her friends knew the way to the logs like the back of their hands. Now all that sits on these logs are pictures, *please call if found* there were hundreds of them now and it all started with Kadie. It had been many years since kids' faces were plastered onto milk cartons so flyers in plastic wallets and tape were all through the trees. From the opening gate behind her house all the way to the bridge over the creek, trees held faces of smiling children and phone numbers to call if they were ever seen again. Even in winter the trees stood tall and the black and white faces still smiled, in summer the leaves started to cover them but as the season turned their smiles escaped nature to see the light once more.

Yesterday Kadie’s mother’s phone rang. It was 6pm but already pitch black. Winter did that to the English sky, it turned it as dark as coal before most people even started making the final meal of the night. The phone still rang as Janice sat on the sofa, glass of wine in hand. It was the house phone, or landline as she'd like to call it, she never wanted to unplug it as it was the only phone number she knew Kadie had memorised. Leaning over she picked up the phone, ‘Hello?’ she asked, hanging her head down into the speaker of the old machine. Almost tasting the old plastic her mouth was so close, or maybe the smell of it was so pungent it overtook her senses.



*STATIC*



‘Hello? Kadie, if it's you please say something.’ she pleaded.



*STATIC*



‘I am hanging up now.’



‘Mummy… I… ca-... yo-... please… I-... dark…’ The words cut through the static only enough to hear partial sentences. Janice knew the voice anyway, she began to tear up. But the words said into the phone sat heavy on her chest. 



‘Kadie? Honey? Tell me where you are! I’ll come and find you. I promise’



‘It’s dark… I ca-... I miss you-... Follow the n-… Star’



*STATIC*



The phone line cut out. ‘Shit!’ Janice yelled. She threw the wine glass at the wall by the family photos she had hung on the wall. Shattering glass flying everywhere, it knocked down one of the pictures as it exploded. The photo of Kadie, the one used for the flyers. She stands smiling with her bright pink camisole top on. Ice cream in hand, as happy as any child could be. Janice picked it up out of the broken glass. Tears falling onto it as she crouched down. She couldn't get back up, she was sobbing hysterically. It felt so real, it was Kadie on the other line. Even after a decade a mother always knows but her voice was still high and childish, as if she hasn't aged a day. Janice felt a pang in her chest. Her daughter called. Kadie had called. The world felt as if it stopped spinning, or as if it was spinning faster. Janice couldn't tell anymore, she may as well have been hanging from the ceiling by her feet. In all her years alone she hadn't considered hearing her daughter's voice again. 

She pulled herself up to her feet and walked out of the back door, she headed for the trees. No time to stop and put shoes on Janice ran towards the creek, her feet now covered in dirt and blood from branches and stones along the path. The creek still flowed along the width of the trees Janice did all she could think to do, throw a stick from the floor as far into the water as she could, anger seeping out of her. Janice remembered walking down here with Kadie and their old dog Winnie, she wished they'd never moved here. Never step foot in this forest. The woods stole her daughter.

Janice woke up in a ball on the floor next to the sofa. There were no glass shards, all the photos were on the wall. The phone had been unplugged with dust settled on the outlet. No sign of what she believed to have happened last night. She felt meaningless, if last night was a dream then Kadie is still a missing person, no leads, no calls. No sign of Kadie for a decade. 



A stack of flyers were spread out on the coffee table in front of her, smiling faces staring up at the ceiling on weathered paper. Janice sifted through the pages but they all said the same phrase under the photos of the children, *please call if found.*
