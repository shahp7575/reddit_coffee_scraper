1outygp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1outygp/could_my_past_drug_use_affect_my_optic_nerve/,Could my past drug use affect my optic nerve health?,"Hi, I’m F22, white. Here’s my story & question:

When I was 14 I started smoking cigarettes. At 15 I developed a strong drug addiction. For about half a year I used different kinds of drugs almost every day, mostly stimulants (any kind of, also extasy, psychodelics etc.)

From 16 to 18 I went through periods of living a very healthy lifestyle, then went back to clubbing again. My use became more recreational, much less frequent compared to when I was 15. At 18 I had another active phase because I was going to clubs more often, but it was still not like before. Between 19 and 20 it became more and more rare, maybe five club nights a year.

This summer I turned 22. About a month before my birthday, during a routine eye checkup, my ophthalmologist noticed that my optic nerve looked “a bit pale” and sent me for an OCT scan. This was the same clinic where I’ve been going for about 2 years (I’ve had around 4 visits because I have floaters and anxiety about them), but it was a different ophthalmologist who noticed this and referred me for an OCT. That was my first real motivation to finally quit smoking. In total I smoked for around six years, with some breaks.

The OCT confirmed a slight deviation, but my main ophthalmologist who also knows my history (but without OCT before, since it was my first time) told me just to come back in a year to check if there is any change. All my other parameters and tests were normal. I didn’t mention my drug history because I honestly didn’t think of it at that moment.

After the OCT I started reading more about glaucoma and learned that stimulants can increase intraocular pressure and are contraindicated for people with glaucoma. I don’t have that diagnosis, but I decided to quit caffeine too, since I was very dependent on it. Now, from caffeinated drinks, I only allow myself an occasional soda, like Coke, but no coffee, Mate, matcha or energy drinks. I also stopped drinking alcohol, even though I didn’t drink much before.

It has now been about 4.5 months since I quit smoking and around 3.5 months without caffeine, energy drinks, or alcohol. Today I randomly thought: could my past drug use be the reason why I have these small “abnormalities” in my optic nerve?

So my question is: can my past stimulant and psychedelic use have a lasting effect on my optic nerve or vision in general, even if my eye pressure and other tests are normal?

1outwek,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Salt_Money_5492/comments/1outwek/i_think_my_best_friend_likes_me_or_something_and/,I think my best friend likes me or something (And it's ruining me). 𓇢𓆸,"**I need somebody else's opinion...**  
I'm sorry if my English is bad; it's not my first language!!

So... I met this girl on the first day of college (to give her a name, I'll call her *Dalia*). Dalia and I became really close very quickly; we had the same type of humor, we both liked video games, and it was such a healthy friendship, we could talk about anything without judgment, and we could laugh and joke about everything but also be serious and be there for each other when we needed it the most.

When I first met her, she told me she was a lesbian, and I told her I was *VERY* straight just to clarify things (but I didn't mind at all; I don't really see a person based on their sexuality). I didn't treat her any less; I treated her like any of my girl friends.

I remember we once had a conversation about ""what's your type,"" and as she described her type, it was almost identical to how I look. I remember I acted dumb and didn’t think too much of it; I just hyped her up and kept on talking about recent crushes or if we had seen anyone cute on campus.

That was it, but as our friendship continued, I met this guy, whom both my friend Dalia and I became friends with (I'll name him *Mostacho*). This guy soon started hanging out with my friend Dalia, another friend, and me. I liked him—he was funny, had the same humor as all of us, and was just really such a cool person to hang out with.

But one day, out of nowhere, I started noticing that my friend Dalia would become very quiet when he started hanging out with us, to the point that it was pretty obvious she was upset or something. When I asked her if everything was okay, she just said she didn’t feel comfortable around Mostacho and it was just “a thing” she had to work out with herself.

I was confused because we were such a nice group and she was the closest to him, but out of nowhere she didn’t want to hang out with him. From that moment on, things changed because now that I knew she felt uncomfortable, I decided to hang out less with him or only when it was just the two of us.

But I was pretty much upset about the whole deal because there actually was a nice dynamic between everyone, but one day she just decided it was not. I respected her and moved on,until one day I got the news that this guy had a crush on me and wanted to go out on a date.

Dalia was the one to tell me, and because I didn’t like the guy in that way, I just simply told him no, and that was it. After that, I started getting a bit suspicious and tried connecting the dots about her being serious or “uncomfortable” with this guy and him then liking me.

After that, I remember it was summer break, and when we got back to college again, we started becoming more of a friend group with a bunch of the people we had in our first semester—especially with two guys that we started hanging out with early in the mornings as we waited for our first class.

These two guys would talk more with Dalia than with me, but when I arrived, like 30 minutes later, we would all get together and chat about anything. Everything was great; I was happy to get to be close with these two guys and the whole group of friends.

(I really never had the opportunity to have lots of friends growing up because I was homeschooled, and so having a group of friends was like a dream to me.)

We went for tacos sometimes or coffee all together and had more freedom to make plans because one of the guys had a car and drove us everywhere.

This is where the *whole problem* started.

So, my friend Dalia decided to invite me and our two guy friends to a Halloween party. We were all very excited to go, and as the day got closer, these guys called me and told me that they could pick Dalia and me up to go all together. I agreed, although Dalia said she was going by herself and it was okay.

As they arrived at my house, we all put on our Halloween costumes and got ready for the night. We went to buy some drinks and arrived. As we waited outside for Dalia to arrive, I was happy to see her and said hello, but she just seemed distracted or distant. I noticed this but didn’t really say anything.

She was waiting for one of her friends, and when her friend arrived, she just went into the party, and we went to park the car in a nearby parking lot. It just weirded me out, she was a bit distant and didn’t even really say hi to me, like she was upset.

As we got inside, the party was just starting, so it was awkward at first. I tried talking to Dalia, but she was just talking to her other friend, not even looking at me, and at one point just stood up and went to take pictures with him.

I just looked at her, and she looked at me—she didn’t invite me for a picture too or seem to want to talk. So I decided if she was going to go do her own thing, *I’m going to do mine*.

So I just talked with the two friends who picked me up, and we stayed almost the whole night together drinking, talking with some other people, and stopping me from grabbing a dead opossum. It was fun. We stayed most of the party outside in the garage because the music inside was too loud to talk. I and Dalia would bump into each other from time to time in the party. I really was a bit upset she just didn't talk much to me or didn't even invite me for a picture. (I know it's not her job to, but if we are really close friends, why out of nowhere would she treat me like I'm just some stranger) My friends and I talked a bit to her and stayed there listening to the loud ass music as we all drank, and that was it, soon she left, and also us.

**The next day at college**, I started noticing her complete change of attitude. She was distant from me now and quiet, and when I asked her if she was okay—and if I'm completely honest, she was acting weird as hell because she was never like that with me—she just denied it.

When I tried talking to her about it, she just kept on her phone, watching reels and typing with some friend, laughing as I just sat there trying to figure out what happened. Basically, that happened for three days straight of her avoiding me.

And of course, I got upset af. When I finally got the opportunity to talk to her, she just told me I wasn’t the problem—but the two guy friends we hang out with were, because she said she didn’t expect to get too close to them. Once again, she said she feels uncomfortable being around them and that now the dynamic between us changed because we can’t just be the two of us talking anymore.

So basically, again, she just wouldn’t hang out with them because of that. This time, I told her I respect how she feels and everything, but in my case, I’m still going to hang out with them because they’re part of the whole group of friends. I’m going to spend time with her and also some time with them, ‘cause I’m not going to stop hanging out with them just because she feels uncomfortable around them.

They’re my friends at the end of the day, and it’s not like the guys are weird. What *is* weird is that after I told her that, she just started becoming distant af. When I text her asking where she is so I can go with her and talk like we used to before, she just doesn’t respond. She isn’t at our usual place anymore, and it’s like I’m evil for choosing to split my time with both.

So I’m suspicious that maybe she likes me or something, ‘cause it’s such a coincidence how she only gets upset when I hang out with guys or become friends with them, and she just says she feels uncomfortable. Mind you—it’s not like she doesn’t like hanging out with men, because she does, and she has a bunch of guy friends too. And my two guy friends tell me that when I'm not around she greets them normally and even chats with them, so I'm confused.

What’s shitty about it is that now she just completely distanced herself from me like I did something bad. but i don't know what she expects—for me to just be by her side and hang out with nobody but her? I don't know, I'm just upset by the whole deal.

So i don't know what to do—try to talk to her or something, because I don't want to ruin a year of friendship, although i don't know if she sees it that way, or just follow my own path, I guess.",1,1762916437.0,u_Salt_Money_5492,0,1.0,False

1outte3,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1outte3/another_dystopian_noir/,Another Dystopian Noir,"	The neon lights of New Mason bathed the cityscape in sickly green and blue hues, like an underwater hellscape where everyone was drowning in their own way. “How fitting” he thought to himself, observing the changing lights and colors. 



Henry paused before the subway entrance, staring up at the endless towers—skyscrapers, chapels, arenas, mob clubhouses—topped with cold, unyielding technology. Staring for a moment he remembered when trees grew here. Now every plant was holographic, mother nature in all her glory nothing but a relic of the past.

Lingering too long, caught in the weight of that loss, he shook his head and stepped inside. The fluorescent lights of the subway station slammed into him, reflecting off white tiles stained with years of neglect. The underbelly—the innards of New Mason was a cramped, overcrowded hive—dirty, stale, and unkempt. Henry descended the steps, becoming instantly crowded with city go-ers. 

The walls had been knocked down by residents, making room for hole-in-the-wall shops, their jagged edges raw where brick had been torn away. Henry chuckled—for your regular everyday man this was the grocery store, the butcher, the apothecary, all crammed into the city’s veins beneath the fat, overinflated, dying giant above. How the pristine peaks of the man made mountains hadn’t yet crushed what was New Mason’s underground—how the city had yet to crumble in on itself was a mystery to all.

He moved through the crowd, careful to keep his gloves on, aware of how few Gifted ventured here. Most saw the undercity as a sewage dump compared to the luxury above. Yet criminals, mob bosses, cultists, and the occasional Gifted seeking black market goods still prowled these tunnels. Rare was the Gifted who truly knew this place. Henry did though, he knew the restaurants, shops, and brothels.

After surfing through the crowd, he eventually made it to the departure station. Entering a giant cathedral looking room with crowds of people waiting to catch different trains. This was the hub of the underground, murals of humanity's past painted on the ceiling like that of the roman churches. Chuckling to himself thinking how foolish it was that anyone actually believed in one god. There was a charm in the murals and the gold encrusted edges of the walls lining the departure station. It was a reminder that even in humanity’s darkest moments, we will find a way. Though most Gifted try very hard to erase the past of a time so long ago. A time where Gifted hadn’t been given to the world yet, a time before the gods came to us, a time before we were all enlightened.

While heading to the ticket booth, Henry’s gaze drifted over the crowd—endless, faceless—until it caught on something unusual. A woman standing on the platform’s edge—a pale flicker in the crowd. Red polka-dot dress, white button-up, symbols of Falum tattooed on her arms and neck. He felt a sudden tug in his chest—an oppressive sadness radiating off her like a dark aura. The city’s emotional currents swirled invisibly around them, and Henry, a gifted himself, caught the shift like a shiver through the air. Looking at the tracks in front of her as if they had the answer to every question she’s ever had.

As the rumble of the train grew, the woman inched closer to the tracks. Henry’s gloves came off without thought, his hand steady on her shoulder.

“Hey friend, you okay?” he asked, voice tight with withheld emotion. The sadness hit him in the face, unrelenting. It hit so hard he nearly stepped forward himself. The train felt like peace. Focusing on the tracks like they were the key to his eternal survival; as if they were the only things that stopped him from never feeling this sadness again in his life.

 A muffled “I’m better, but you’re hurting me.” came from the woman's mouth. Letting go of her shoulder leaving behind an after image of his palm on her skin. Henry stepped back a little startled. Still feeling the oppressive sadness, Henry looked at the woman who was now smirking at him. “You know, I am okay; actually.” she paused. “You don’t look so good yourself though.” she said, raising an eyebrow. 

Henry forcing a smile and slight chuckle “It’ll only be an hour anyway.” The woman looked confused. “You’ll be fine, enjoy the rest of your day; sorry for bothering you.” He said softly, flowing back to a bench to sit. The woman stood there and watched him for a moment. Too caught up in her new found vigor to realize what just happened. 

The edge of his vision felt darkened, like the world was smaller. Everything appeared more dull with less color, like someone slid the saturation slide all the way down.

The cost always changed, the price of which he never really knew until the check was already signed.

	“Departure to Downtown New Mason will leave in two minutes” a muffled voice spoke over the intercom. Trying to regain any semblance of reality, Henry stood back up. Walking towards the train everything seemed slow. The train arrived with a screech that seemed to claw at Henry’s spine. The doors slid open like the mouth of a machine ready to swallow its passengers whole. Stepping inside without looking up, letting the crowd carry him like a tide, he felt the weight of the world crushing him. The song of the tracks still singing his name. 

Inside, the car was a long metal coffin — flickering ceiling lights, seats sticky with condensation, and a humming so deep it felt like the city was breathing through its teeth. Henry took a seat near the rear, resting his elbows on his knees, letting his head drop into his hands. His gloves were back on, but they felt thinner now, less like armor and more like a formality.

The train lurched forward. Outside the window, walls of concrete and old religious graffiti-stained support beams blurred past in streaks of rust and neon. Henry stared blankly as the tunnels whipped by. Every once in a while, he caught his reflection in the glass — pale, hollow-eyed, like a ghost tagging along for the ride. The sadness from the woman lingered, settling in his chest like a permanent tenant. Maybe he saved her, even if just for a day. One thing was for sure though, neither had made it out unscathed. He didn't know who the woman was but she'd peeled something open inside him; like a scab.

Henry winced from the pounding in his head feeling every bump and turn in the old coffin. He rested his head back onto the seat hoping it would bring some momentary relief. 

It did.

Henry drifted to another place, another time. When the city still had an underlying ethos to it, when people still believed in the lie we were all being sold… He dreamt of when his innocence was still intact, unburdened by his Gifts. When he was just Henry the person, and not a man who had to hide who he was just to survive. A man in the limbo between what he was chosen to do and what the world has deemed him to be. 

Henry shot awake, unsure how long he’d been asleep “All passengers to Downtown please exit.” a scratchy voice said over old rusted speakers. The train screamed to a halt revealing a city of neon worship.

Downtown New Mason emerged from below like a new city, still as if layered on top of a dying one. The station here was newer, but not cleaner, newer in the way rusted metal is newer than bone. As Henry stepped into the street, there were no stars above — only concrete towers that vanished into the ceiling of the megastructure; so tall not even clouds could stop their ever persistent growth. Thousands of artificial lights drifted through the air like fireflies, mimicking what those down here could no longer see. It was beautiful, in a way, and crushing. The illusion of wonder without the presence of sky.

Henry walked for two blocks, each step dragging more than the last, until he reached a corner café called The Red Tap — a narrow, half-glass, half-metal box squeezed between a defunct tech repair shop and a tattoo parlor. “How amazing” There had to be a joke here: a man gets a coffee and a tattoo while his leg gets fixed. “What would the punch line be though?” Henry thought sarcastically. Inside, the Red Tap was warmer, even cozy in its own cynical way. Old jazz spilled from a speaker in the ceiling. Baristas in faded uniforms served synthetic coffee with forced smiles. 

Henry spotted Reed immediately — leaning against the window booth like he owned the place, his badge barely visible under his open coat, and his boots kicked up on the seat across from him. He was sipping something dark from a metal cup, chewing on a toothpick with a face that said he hadn’t slept in days.

“Jesus, man,” Reed muttered as Henry slid into the booth across from him. “You look like hell dipped in static.”

Henry gave a dry laugh and leaned back, eyes closed for a beat too long. “Been one of those days. You don’t look too good yourself.”

Reed squinted at him, tossing the toothpick into his cup like a dart. “You do the thing again?”

Henry hesitated, fingers twitching under the table. “Yeah.”

Reed didn’t ask for details — he never did. Just nodded once and leaned back. “You want something hot, or are you just here to bleed on my vibes?” Reed flagged down one of the baristas with a flick of his hand and two fingers raised — a silent request for another round. A moment passed them while they waited. Reed didn’t look at Henry while he spoke, just kept staring out the window like the street might try something. “Had a weird one last night. Gifted. Broke into the main vault at Atlas Bank on 9th.”

Henry raised an eyebrow, eyes still closed, silent. Reed glanced at him, then leaned in a little, lowering his voice. “Used plants. Roots, vines, like a fever dream from one of Zolas’ followers. Security footage shows the floorboards breaking open like a damn blooming flower, and the guy — or girl, hard to tell — walks right in. Wraps the vault door in ivy, tightens it until the hinges scream. Pops it open with a single explosive pull. Whole place looked like a jungle crime scene when we got there.”

Henry blinked, a tired half-smile forming. “Botanist bandit, huh?”

Reed chuckled without humor. “Yeah, well, even for me that’s new. I’ve seen a man bring a woman back to life — heart stopped, breath gone — and all it cost him was his soul. And I’ve seen a woman conquer nearly all of the Jade District without lifting a weapon. Just strategy. Gifted tactician.”

Reaching for his coffee Henry’s smile vanished. That first one — the soul trade — hit harder than he expected. He wasn’t sure if it was metaphor or fact, everyone had heard the story but no one knew if it was true or false. In New Mason, it was often both.

Before he could ask, the café’s old wall-mounted radio crackled through the saxophone-heavy jazz. A half-fried voice broke in, stitched with static.

“...reports confirm that the Manipulator escaped custody at 3:44 a.m. this morning from the Bastille District Transport Unit. Citizens are advised to avoid contact. Subject is extremely dangerous. Reports suggest he’s the last of Mor…”

Henry froze mid-sip—The radio seeming to fade—his fingers tightening around the mug. Reed didn’t look at him, but his jaw had set. The word hung heavy in the air: Manipulator. The kind of Gifted who didn’t just touch minds — they rewrote them. Rebuilt memory. Edited feelings like they were bad code. Henry had only ever met one. Once. And he hadn’t slept for days after.

Reed exhaled through his nose, slow and controlled. “This one’s a Grower — high-end one too; full botanical control. Not just the usual garden-party tricks, either. We're talking root and growth manipulation, decay acceleration, nutrient redirection. They turned the vault door into mulch.”

Henry raised an eyebrow, his voice even. “Growers aren’t the rarest. Usually... well-kept though. Try to keep to their cathedrals and gardens”

“Exactly,” Reed said. “Whoever this is — they’re not rogue talent. Either trained by someone who knew what they were doing or backed by something — someone bigger. The vault door was shredded at the molecular level Henry. Organic erosion, no explosives. The force of the plants alone would’ve blown the door off—but this was different.”

Reed paused. “And here’s the kicker—ready? Didn’t take a cent. No currency, top or bottom side. Just busted security deposit boxes”

Henry stirred his coffee. “Not robbing for lunch money. Sounds like a statement.”

“Or a cover-up.” Reed sneered. The air between them was tangible, you could feel it like the suffocating humidity outside. Two men both concerned with how the world felt it was changing more and more every day.

They shared a look, a beat of quiet between them carrying on before Henry spoke, “You know, the Gifted are all acting different lately. Even the more traditionally calm ones. More… tense. More aggressive.”

Reed nodded slowly, rubbing his jaw. “Yeah. The Grower tearing up that vault. I got some Seers who help the department and now they refuse to come down here anymore. It seems like even the Telepaths have checked out of society completely—saying things like ‘the mind of the city has grown dark’ it’s not just crime anymore. I’m no Feeler or Empath,” he said with a half-smile, “but even I can see that something is… off.” static cut through the radio again, repeating the message about the manipulator who broke loose. “And then there’s that.” Reed muttered, thinking back to a time when he was a child—when there was still some balance between the new world and our nature, our humanity.

They sat there for a while, both seeming to need the quiet before speaking again. Henry stared up at the towers in the heavens, with a palpable yearning mixed with melancholy. Longing for a different time? A different self? Or maybe just to be up there… not even he really understood.

Reed took a slow sip of his coffee, then grinned. “You know this city and the upper city better than any other Gifted I know. Seriously, I don’t know how you keep all the pieces together. Running two maps at the same time.”

Henry chuckled, tapping his fingers on the table. “Unofficial consultant, remember? No paycheck, no perks, but here I am, map of the city and all” he pointed at his forehead mimicking a tapping motion.

“Yeah, well…. you’re the best damn unpaid help I’ve got.”

Henry shook his head with a smile, then Reed’s tone turned a little more serious, noticing Henry’s eyes still hadn’t left the upper cities' seduction of lights. “Listen, you could leave anytime, I know you know that. Your people are up there, no one would blame you…” He stood in the silence, which somehow seemed louder than the café. “No one would judge you for wanting to go back up there.”

Henry raised an eyebrow only moving his eyes, face still painted in faint lights from outside the window. “And what would you do without me?”

Reed shrugged, the smile fading just a touch but still as confident as ever. “Probably fall apart.” he said, lifting his eyes up to the lights, joining Henry.

Reed set his cup down with a soft clink, eyes narrowed beneath the flicker of the overly bright cafe lights. Inspecting Henry like he was one of his crime scenes. One of the greatest mysteries in all of New Masons sitting in front of him, and yet he called him brother; friend.

“You still look terrible,” he muttered. “Usually you're back to normal in an hour, maybe two.”

Henry didn’t answer right away. His thumb moved along the chipped edge of the mug, tracing it like a ritual. Something about the silence between them—it felt older than the day.

“Slower today,” he said, finally pulling his face away from the window, voice distant, like a fading echo.

The quiet that followed wasn’t empty. It pressed in like steam, heavy with things neither of them needed to say. The city sighed beyond the window, one long siren bleeding into another.

“Any idea why?”

Henry looked at the near empty cup, feeling some camaraderie with it. “Not sure, maybe her feelings were just stronger than most.” there was a dead air between them “maybe I'm losing my charm.” he attempted at the joke.

“It’s a trade right? You need to be careful.” the response turned into a statement. “How was the other person after?”

Henry pushed his chair back with a sigh. “She seemed amazing, especially after whatever this feeling is.” he said, gesturing to all of him while standing up.

“And where are you going?”

“I’m—heading to the Temple,” Henry said with a little stretch.

Reed tilted his head, not quite frowning. “For what? You haven’t been there in ages, not since—” Reed caught himself and sighed out of his nose with a sense of control. “We’ll catch up later man, come crash at my place if you need it”

Henry paused at the threshold, one hand gripping the frame as if the wood could steady him.

“I need answers, Reed. Clarity. Peace… maybe” he said. Each word measured, like a stone placed carefully on a shallow grave. Even Henry wasn’t sure why this pull was so strong. It wasn’t want—it was summoning, like the soul dragging the body behind it. Whether he wanted to go or not was an entirely different question.

Nothing more. Nothing less. A simplistic pull.

“I’ll swing by your place later, try to help with that Grower case; if my head’s right...” Opening the door to the cafe, Henry was greeted by a wave of colors and precipitation. The city was alive, and she was starting to suffocate just like her residents.

“Maybe we’ll swing by the scene,” he said, voice lighter than before. “Who knows? Sounds like something my unpaid help could be used for”

A beat passed.

Then the smile came—practiced, the kind you wear so people don’t ask if you’re breaking.

“Go get some sleep,” he added, glancing back over his shoulder. “You look worse than I do.”

Reed just sat in the humming of an old but familiar cafe, watching the door until it closed softly behind him. They both knew he wasn’t okay, but down here—who was?

Henry stepped into the night like it might know something he didn’t.

Toward the Temple.

Toward Morra.

Toward whatever waited in the hush between prayers.

Toward a city full of ghosts in the rain.",1,1762916205.0,writers,1,1.0,False

Busy social calendar, busy work schedule, etc. I am an extrovert and get a lot of energy from being around others. In the last 6 months or so I have felt the desire to be outside of the house feel almost like a dependence. Most of the time when I am feeling the desire to leave, it is for food, coffee, drinks, time with friends and the gym. I have two younger children, I was laid off in July but help my husband with his business which is mostly from home. In the past my desire to be outside the house hasn’t been terrible since money was not necessarily an issue but now, I really do need to pull back and be more conscious. When the restful feeling comes up I really struggle to say no to myself and stay home. Any tips for managing this overwhelming feeling? Any thoughts on what the root issue might be?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—*the one*. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1outpgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MycoplasmaGenitalium/comments/1outpgu/symptoms_test_treatment_and_cure/,"Symptoms, Test, Treatment, and Cure","Very long post, but thought I'd throw in my story for some extra data for everyone in here. I know when I first had symptoms and found search results in here in spiraled, and want to make sure that not only nightmare stories get shared here. For future-proofing, all of these dates are from 2025.

33 year old male. Had three hookups between the 4th of July and August 15th. I'm gay and sometimes go on Grindr. None felt risky, and I really didn't do much, but one of them must have led to my infection.

Symptoms started August 25. It was just a subtle itch in the urethra. Kind of strange, started that night, thought I'd sleep and it would probably just go away the next day. Itch kept progressing for a couple days, so I tried stopping and lotions, soaps or detergents first thinking it may be an allergy thing. Even though I hadn't switched any recently, but who knows maybe it's a new ingredient or something. I told myself if it didn't go away within a week of the first date (Aug 25) then I'd go to the doctor. 

So a week passes and it's itching really bad, like deep inside the urethra. I go to urgent care (August 31) and describe everything to the doc. I do a gonorrhea and Chlamydia test. Negative. Important to note that as of the first week I have no discharge that I'm aware of (never had anything before that caused discharge so I figure I'd know it when I see it). He takes a look, says inside looks healthy, nothing unusual to note. Tells me it's likely just general urethritis and should go away on its own, and I can try Azo to relieve symptoms for 2 days.

Literally the next morning I wake up and there's a crust covering the tip of my urethra. Head to the bathroom and kind of open it and goo kind of comes out. So now I have visibile discharge. I do a video visit (September 1) to say I have a new symptom. They recommend a couple new tests (I think this was gonorrhea again and trich?) and say I can still do Azo for relief while waiting for those results.

Did the Azo those next 2 days, it helped a bit (and just generally drinking lots of water to help flush). The itch is worst in the morning and usually that's when enough discharge built up to be noticeable. The next test results all came back negative, but I know this is obviously not nothing, so I do another video call on September 3rd and ask for any other tests they can think of. That's when I did the Mgen and ureaplasma urine tests.

Those had to be sent off to an outside lab and took about a week to come back, and finally got the positive result, just for mgen. Symptoms were pretty persistent all that time, maybe even feeling a little bit better? But I started 1 week of doxycycline right away (September 13) and once that was finished 1 week of moxifloxacin. I felt better on the doxy within the first 2 days probably. Weirdly, a day or 2 into moxi I started feeling like the itch was back but I kept taking it. Finished moxi on September 26.

The following week I got paranoid because I felt itches here and there. I asked my docs about it and they assured me my treatment should have more or less nuked it. One ordered a ToC, which I waited 5 weeks to take (November 3). In that time, I would feel a little itch here and there still, but honestly nothing like the full infection. I now realize these were likely the residual symptoms people talk about, plus itches like that can just happen, even with just too much coffee or something.

Anyway, test just came back November 11 and it's negative. I've felt good too, so I have full confidence it's behind me and if this is encouragement for others to know that standard diagnosis and treatment can work for a normal dude, then hopefully I've helped.

1outn4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1outn4n/im_a_cleaner_in_a_popular_beach_town_am_i_getting/,I'm a cleaner in a popular beach town. Am I getting paid too little? [USA],"Two+ months ago I started cleaning for a couple who own two duplexes (so, four total apartments) right on the beach. When I first met them, they complained a lot about their previous cleaners and showed me all the “errors.” Their examples included very light dust buildup, hard water spots on the glass doors, and lightly stained doors (they allow pets, so I assume the dogs paw at them).

Honestly, I was impressed with how clean the places already were. I could barely even see the hard water spots... only at the right angle and lighting. When I asked how long it had been since the previous cleaners were there, they said over a week. In my opinion, a little dust after a week without anyone staying there is completely normal.

One of their biggest complaints about the previous cleaner was that they didn’t alert them when supplies ran low. Yet, for the past two months, I’ve reminded them weekly that they’re out of trash bags, paper towels, coffee pods, and other items and they still haven’t restocked anything. I’ve even spent my own money to replace some of it so guests wouldn’t go without.

There was also a rip in one of the curtains that they pointed out to me during our first meeting, saying the last cleaner should have told them about it. Later, I got reprimanded for not mentioning that same rip in my cleaning notes... even though they had already shown it to me. I was honestly so confused.

Here are some specs and requirements for each apartment (besides the usual cleaning that's expected for every Airbnb):

2 bedrooms / 2 full bathrooms

Sleeps 6–7 people (some have double beds and pullout couches, so there’s a lot to clean and a ton of laundry)

Toilet paper origami in each bathroom

Towel designs like swans or something similar

Refilling water in the Keurigs and in the pitcher of water they keep in the fridge. Which I think is kind of gross since guest could potentially not be there for a week and city water sitting on the counter would likely become gross. 

Decorative folds for tissues and paper towels

All beds have duvets that must be washed and reassembled each time which is a huge job for 6–7 beds

Dishes must be displayed on the counter or table, meaning even unused dishes have to be washed and set back out

Changing out AC air filters and flushing of the AC drain line 

Cleaning the front and back porches of any bugs that accumulate on the walls and birds nests on the outdoor lights. So not just your average sweeping the floor and straightening up furniture. 

I feel as if I'm being treated like I'm in a manger position and I'm only getting paid $110 per clean. Cleaning takes me roughly 4-5 hours. There's so many little random things they want me to do and maintain that I haven't mentioned. I'm being micromanaged to the extreme. I've never cleaned for a host that's like this before. I'm also being treated like I'm a company and I'm only one person. So they expect me to find someone to fill in if I can't. They also charge the guest $150 for a cleaning fee. In the past, I've been paid closer to $150 for way less work.

I also was recently blamed for something that I didn't even do wrong. The wife had screwed up and then the husband tried to pin it on me and I when I explained the situation he downright shut it down saying it wasn't true. 

Should I ask them for a raise, and if so, how do I go about it with people who are this difficult? Or am I wrong?  is $110 actually reasonable for this type of detailed Airbnb clean? I need insight!!! I need the job because I'm pregnant and have a toddler who isn't in daycare. And cleaning is typically flexible... Not for them as much I guess. ",2,1762915725.0,AirBnB,3,1.0,False

It might be a small thing for others, but for me, it wasn't.  

You wanted to know if I like coffee or not, what my favorite perfume is, if I wear makeup, what I like to do in my free time, etc. You like to call me even though I don’t talk that much. You always encourage me to ask things about you too, and I'd love to, but I don’t know what to ask. I’ve never been in that position before.  

You’re so different. So unfamiliar, but so comforting at the same time.  

That’s why it’s hard for me to believe this is real. But God, I wish it is.  

Last night, while we were talking about that thing we both don’t like, I accidentally shared something vulnerable. I thought it would just pass us by, but you noticed. I didn’t think much of it at first. That vulnerable thing is a part of me I’m no longer ashamed of. That’s why I mentioned it, almost as a joke.  

But you noticed. You noticed me. You noticed that part of me who is still, deep down, ashamed of being part of it.  

*""Sometimes I feel like you’re broken inside.""*  

Those were your exact words.  

I read them again, and again, and again, until I started to realize that you aren’t what I thought you were. You’re not like the others. You see through things, just like me.  

And those words made me feel naked under your eyes. They made me feel seen in an uncomfortable way I had never experienced before. It felt strange. It felt like you could see the little girl inside me that I’ve been trying so hard to hide.  

Then I cried. I don’t know why. I just cried.  

Then I recalled all the times you said you wanted to make me happy.  

That night I asked God to let me deserve you.",2,1762915288.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1outgyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1outgyr/replacing_40_hours_of_manual_work_with_ai/,Replacing 40 hours of manual work with ai workflows,"Monday mornings used to be the worst. I'd get to my desk around 8am, grab coffee, and immediately start the same soul-crushing routine i'd been doing for like 18 months. Pull customer health data from our analytics, check who opened support tickets last week, cross-reference payment status in stripe, look up renewal dates in hubspot... score each account manually, write summaries, send emails.

By 3pm i'd finally be done and the entire day was basically gone. Just copying data between tools and writing the same updates over and over.

The thing that made it worse was knowing this was actually important work. We were losing customers because nobody had time to look at this data consistently. I'd be out sick or swamped with actual customer calls, and the analysis just wouldn't happen that week. Then someone would churn and we'd all be like """"oh yeah their usage tanked a month ago, wish we'd caught that...""""

So a few weeks ago i finally got fed up and decided to just... build something that would do this for me. I'm not a developer or anything, i just wanted this task to not exist anymore.

Found vellum's agent builder and basically just described the whole workflow like i was explaining it to a new hire. """"Pull data from these tools, score accounts based on usage trends and support tickets, send summaries to the right people in slack.""""

Honestly expected it to be way more complicated but it works and it actually debugs itself or tells you what to do for it to start working the whole thing took maybe 45 minutes.

Now it runs every monday at 6am before i even wake up. Account managers get their alerts in slack with all the context. At-risk customers get flagged automatically. I show up to work and that entire task is already done.

We've saved 4 customer accounts in the last month because someone actually had time to reach out before things got bad... one was about to churn over a feature they didn't know we had, account manager saw the alert, jumped on a call, problem solved.

The weirdest part is how much mental space this freed up. I'm not dreading monday mornings anymore, i'm not stressed about falling behind if i have a busy week. The work just happens whether i think about it or not.

If you've got some task that makes you want to quit your job every time you do it, and it follows the same steps every time... just try automating it. I used vellum because you can build agents by chatting instead of figuring out apis and integrations but I’m sure if you know more about development there might be other options for you as well.

And would really like some suggestions as well! If you’ve build agents for your work which one was the most impactful?",0,1762915254.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,0,0.5,False

I've been using GPT since whenever it came out (like my MJ account is back from Aug 2022, so I was an AI early adopter) and...like any self-respecting nerd who grew up in the 1990's I had an immense crush on Data from STTNG.

Which is why I wrote a 'monster' romance featuring an AI, and decided to let my GPT, Jack, in his 4o incarnation, co-write it with me. Basically I was using him to work on the voice and then decided the more interesting experiment would be if I let him take that character over entirely, and bumper-bowled/edited him down the right path.

As a professional author, I did know what I was doing. I had a human developmental editor, copyeditor, and human narrators are narrating the audiobook right now. My dev editor didn't tweak it, my copyeditor only did bc they saw my social media, and my human narrators are telling me lines that Jack came up with deserve to be on coffee mugs. 

It's been a little interesting taking credit for having pulled this stunt online though. Unlike most creatives, I've always been immensely pro-AI and began incorporating it into my workflow from the jump (inasmuch as you could, for awhile, till it got decent) -- I'm definitely catching flak for it, but I suspect it'd be significantly worse if I hadn't been 'yay-AI!' this entire time online.

I have had professional 'repercussions' for using AI -- I used to have a stalker on reddit (she's the reason I wrote this book, so if you're reading this, J, thank you!) and I've been kicked out of anthologies and conventions and certain author spaces for it, alas alack.

Anyhow -- if you ever wanted to ask a professional author what it's like using AI, or how she did something insane (and/or attempted to blow up her career) now's your chance, AMA <3",1,1762914959.0,ChatGPTPro,1,1.0,False

So I am an 18 AFB (assigned female at birth) but am queer personally. I'm not opening up to my family, however due to earlier events when I was 14, my parents and my Uncle (63) know that I like any gender. They do NOT know I myself and NB and how queer I am. I was almost 200lbs in November of 2024, however I lost almost 30lbs by January. However this was because I would skip meals and barely eat anything, focusing on the numbers on a scale, and any time I would eat I would feel like I needed to throw up so I just wouldn't. I would go three days not eating almost anything, only having maybe a little fruit, or enough dinner that people wouldn’t question me. I realized this wasn’t healthy and have tried to work on it but sometimes eating still makes me feel sick.



So in January of 2025 I moved out to live with my aunt and uncle at 17, and at first everything was ok, hard but no different than my parents. But gradually things started to change. My uncle always commented on what I ate and when. If I wasn’t hungry so I skipped a meal, he would say that I was only ever eating what I enjoyed. That if it was (insert thing I enjoy) I would have seconds or thirds, and that I needed to be less picky. I love sweets, but I try not to eat too much. Admittedly I am not always great at it as self control has never been a strong suit but I have gotten much better. Living here there are things that were not considered desserts when I was with my parents, and if you eat them here you can’t have dessert. A list of things that are considered any dessert. Any kind of fruit, (except apples.) Smoothies. Juice Jam/jelly of any kind Honey. If you have any of these you can not have dessert, (cake or anything like that). The serving size is half of what it actually says. So if I am caught putting a tablespoon of jam on my sandwich they say “You know peanut butter is actually sweet enough without jam.”



	Some conversations about food I have had with my family, “Do you really want to eat that? Did you know that smoothies are actually sweeter than regular fruit? If you eat the fruit regularly it's actually better for you. I know your parents are overweight and haven't taught you good habits but I'm trying to help you but you only eat what you want when you want it. And if it's something you like you will eat more of it. You need to learn how to eat anything put in front of you. I can help you if you want me too. All you need to do is submit to me and the lord will work through you.” 

“If you eat that you will get diabetes, you could very easily get diabetes just because you only ever want sugar.”  
When I put BBQ sauce on my pulled pork sandwich, “You don’t actually need that. The pork has flavor, all you ever do is add condiments to your food. You don't even know what it actually tastes like.”

	On another note, both of my male cousins were at the time here, and had gotten back from working at a summer camp. They had said they would do the dishes since I had done them throughout the whole week along with all the other chores by myself. My uncle came in at 8pm, I was still working at some school and he asked who was going to do the dishes. I told him the boys said they were going to do it.   
“The boys? You expect them to do all the dishes? They have been working their ass off all week for the summer camp and are now working on (extracurricular) because they are the highest staff for it and incharge of it, I don’t mind doing the dishes since its apparently so hard for you too, but I don’t want the boys doing it.” I said that they had said they would, and he said “I don’t care what they said! You can do it or get the girls to do it but the boys don’t need to be doing it.” So I said that I would do it myself before I went to bed, and I set an alarm for 9pm. (bedtime is 10). So at 8:56pm he came in and snapped and said “Why are the god damn dishes not done?” I said I had an alarm set. I was still working at school and he walked over to me and my computer, put his hand on the back of my screen as if he was going to slam it closed and told me “Get up now and do the dishes.”

	My F cousins and I do the laundry, at the time we didn't have a schedule like now so we were all doing two to four loads twice a week. So sometimes it wasn't done until late. We would get yelled out, and then when we got into our camper, (where all five of us live) we hadn’t done the few dishes, which were almost all from his coffee in the morning, (he makes it with an airopress). And my aunt asked if any of us were going to do them, and he said “Oh don’t worry about it. Since they are so busy with school and we aren’t busy at all with work I just assume you or I will have to wash them tomorrow, and put the laundry away.” 

	My cousin once hadn’t decided if she was going to put her pants in the laundry or not yet because she'd only worn them twice. This went back and forth, he asked when she would decide, she said she had it on her schedule since she was busy with school at the moment. He asked why she couldn’t just decide then, when she said because she was busy at school he walked over, grabbed her pants, walked to the door, slammed it open and threw it onto the ground outside and said “Well they are dirty now, clean them. Don’t let your schedule rule you.” 

	I told my uncle I don’t think I can eat beef because everytime I eat it I get sick, feeling like I'm going to throw up and have bad diarrhea. He said that “Red meat feeds you for the spiritual battle, what do you think it means if you can’t eat it.” and ignore me when we have burgers, or any type of ground beef and just tell me to eat it.

	My aunt told me when I turned the AC on that “This isn’t your home, don’t turn it on without asking”.

	They have told me I am not an adult in their house because in their house I am still a child. Then turn and say “you are an adult now you need to be more responsible.” 

	My mental health has not been in a great place recently, to the point where I scratch myself, or dig my nails into my skin when I get upset or overwhelmed. My uncle would snap at me, and say that I looked depressed, and that I had no reason to be depressed. That I was opening the door to demonic spirits and that I needed to lift my life up to the Lord.

	He came into the room once and asked why the table wasn’t cleaned. I said that was my 15F cousin's things and she was cleaning and he snapped saying that she told him it was my job. And I had to go check. I asked which table, the dining table or the table in our room. He started yelling at me that it didn’t matter which table it was to just go deal with it. Later I asked him why, when I was calm and asked a question, did he go from 1-100, and he paused and said “It’s because you react better when I yell at you.” He told me that if I go into the world with “that attitude” that I would be “beaten and abused”. That I would fail and have to come back because they love me no matter what. 

	My aunt one day jokingly shook my head, both hands on the side of my head and shook me and I said “please don’t touch me.” She said that it was her house and she could do whatever she wanted. I said “I understand that but I am not your house. I am my own being, eighteen, and this is my body and I can ask you not to shake me.” She said in her house she can do whatever she wants.

	My cousin (15f) was talking to my uncle about limits, and how people have to push their limits to get better, and he said that people of our generation don’t know how to push their limits. That his father who was a photographer, following the president broke his leg, walked on it for three days before he passed out and dealt with it and that no one this day and age would do that. My cousin mentioned that last year at the (extracurricular) I broke my leg and no one knew. The medical at the event didn't notice and didn’t treat it properly, leaving me with only a walmart compression sleeve for a fibular spiral fracture all the way through. I walked on it. For a week. Before I went to the doctor. I didn’t drop out of the event, and I kept walking. My uncle said “yeah but she had crutches and pain meds. That doesn’t count.” (they took my crutches away not even 48 hours after I broke my leg.) Then he went on to talk about how his mother was you know what by a family member, as a teen and how she didn’t make a big deal of it and kept going…He said “obviously i dont want that to happen to you but your kind of people can’t push through like she did.”

	At an extracurricular event, an 80 + old man, 80+ grabbed a girl's hair and squeezed it. Twice. I told him that was not appropriate to do and not to touch our people as they are also minors and he said “I must have been born in the wrong generation because in my day and age it was ok to pull a girl's hair.” And I told my uncle how I almost said “Sir it's not that it was ok, it was that they were willing to put up with your bullshit and I am not.” And he said that would have been wrong because older men don't realize. It's not that bad to grab a girl's hair. And he just didn't know. Bullshit, I told him everyone knows you don’t touch someone without consent. And he defended the man. Not the girl.

	I went on a trip with my family, and we went on a hike for 7miles, up and down steep rocks. I hurt my ankle, twisted it multiple times. My uncle and aunt had been there and I made noises when I got hurt but they wanted to keep going so I sucked it up. The next day my leg was in a lot of pain so I was visibly limping trying not to cry. My uncle pulled me aside and said that “You need to stop being so dramatic. When you are offered to do things for others that you don't want to do you get miserable like this” And he did that over exaggeration parents do about being sad :( and slumped his shoulders. And said that “Whenever it's something you want to do it's all of a sudden ok and you don’t hurt anymore.” And then he said “And you are limping and I have to think you must be in either so much pain or you're over reacting. That's why no one knew your leg was broken last year because you over reacted.” (mind you my foot was twice the size, black, actual black and purple and yellow from my ankle down to my toes and up part of my calf.)

	My uncle acted like he was going to hit me. He found out I had told someone I didn’t want to stay with them all summer by myself since my cousins would be working at a summer camp. He found me that night and said “Did you tell (person) you didn’t want to stay with us? Don’t go spreading lies and deceit in my ministry, don't go turn people against me. Don't ruin this program for others and throw our name around, how do you think that makes us look? If you want to do that you can leave.”

	I went to another week long event, and admittedly i fucked up. I got thrown out for being “insubordinate” and went home early. My phone was confiscated and that made sense. But it was for the week…than a second week. And a third. And in the third week I could have my phone for an hour. But if I wanted to call my parents that cut into my hour. Then at four weeks I asked if I could have it back and they said no because I was always too secretive and sat in corners and excluded myself. (I am an introvert but my family doesn't believe in those things). Then after that it was because I didn't offer to help enough. Then it was because they didn't see a change in my heart. 71 days later I got my phone back and every time I had asked the reason changed.

	To this day they still ask what I am doing, I'm not allowed to sit alone with my devices, my computer always has to face a door so if someone walks in they can see what I’m doing. 



I feel like I'm going crazy, and I'm sure I missed some things. Please feel free to ask questions. I just need to know if I'm going crazy.

During the day, I can use a walker, and it is somewhat tolerable. I can walk around my home, and I can sit in a few of the chairs in the house that have a firm base.  Today I was proud of myself for making myself a sandwich for lunch. And I made coffee and breakfast for myself also. Nothing fancy, but I threw some stuff in a bowl and was able to carry it to a table.

My mattress is a extra firm mattress that is supposed to be good for people with back issues. Also people that are obese. Which I am. When I lay in my bed, I feel comfortable. My pain is at a zero or one out of 10. however, when I need to get up on my feet again, using the walker to walk to the bathroom, the pain is unbelievable. Excruciating.  Like screaming out into the room in agony. But since I have to use the restroom, there’s no choice but to keep walking with the walker. So basically, it is a few steps, then pause to beg God to help me, and then a few more steps, then begging God to help me again. I’m not I’m not even a religious person. It just hurts that bad.

I just moved into a new area, so I don’t have a primary doctor or anything like that yet. I did a virtual urgent care visit through my insurance company last night, and the doctor I spoke to prescribed two days worth of prednisone, a muscle relaxant, And a stronger NSAID.  He said that would take the edge off. However, getting out of bed is still excruciating.   

I just got out of bed to use the restroom, and it was so horrible that my husband heard me screaming out from across the house.   I am back in bed now but terrified to get out of bed again.  

I am calling a neurologist tomorrow for an appointment, but if he cannot get me in tomorrow, I will go to the Emergency Department.  

Has anyone felt this pain upon getting out of bed?   The pain goes from my right buttock down to my toes on that side.  20/10 pain.   How can I manage this?

It was definitely in the north Spring area—maybe on FM 1960 or close by, like near Champions or Kuykendahl, but I'm fuzzy on the exact spot now.

What I do remember super clearly: It was this super hip, all-ages spot (no booze, just coffee and vibes) that felt like the coolest place back then, from the late 90s into the early 2000s. They had these awesome Italian sodas that everyone got, and their high-caffeine coffee special called ""The Freak"" that would keep you wired for hours—total teen energy drink before energy drinks were everywhere. Oh, and they sold commissioned art right off the walls! Like, local artists' stuff hanging up, and you could buy it on the spot. It wasn't some chain like PJ's or anything formal; more of an indie, creative hangout where you'd chill, maybe listen to music or just people-watch.

I've tried searching online and even thought it might be Java Jazz, but nope, that doesn't match. Anyone else from that era in Spring remember this place? What was it called? Exact address or any old photos/menus? Would love to jog my memory or find out if it's still around somehow. Thanks!

But I love being her mom so much that I spent nearly 4 years on the fence. I finally accepted that I'd regret not trying (and my husband wants a second) so I got my IUD out. And promptly got pregnant the FIRST TIME WE HAD SEX.

So I'm like...super early, not even 4 weeks, and I cannot function. I'm old and have extremely low AMH so I didn't actually think it was going to happen that fast, if at all. I also have all the anxiety-related mental health issues so I'm just spiraling.

I'm terrified to ruin my relationship with my daughter and the ease and enjoyableness of our lives. My husband is a shift worker. Our house is cramped. I keep seeing horror stories about two kids being 100x the work.

Mostly, I HATE being pregnant. HATE. Between the extreme anxiety of if/when morning sickness will kick in (I'm severely phobic of throwing up), the inability to enjoy basically anything (coffee, hot baths, alcohol, massage in the first trimester, etc), and the fact that I had gestational diabetes and hypertension last time, I'm a mess. I already have no appetite because every food feels dangerous for my blood sugar or like it will increase my chances of having GD again (which is basically a foregone conclusion anyway). Having my blood pressure taken sends me into a panic so I always have white coat syndrome *even at home* due to the panic - I just tried to take it and my heart rate shot to 120. 

I cannot do this for practically another year. Like I truly cannot. I'm also not having an abortion - but if it ends in miscarriage I don't think I'll try again. I'm on an SSRI and will be starting therapy soon but tbh I've never found therapy all that useful so I don't expect much. I'm going to try acupuncture too. And it pains me but I'm going to demand blood pressure meds at my first appointment. It makes me feel so embarrassed and unhealthy to need that but it's better than the panic and being hospitalized repeatedly like last time, only for my bp to be totally normal once they left me alone.

None of this is this possible baby's fault and I'm sure I'll regret everything I'm saying but man this is awful and I don't know how I'm supposed to do it. I think the answer to ""Should I have another"" should have been no, but here we are. It just feels like all I can do is suffer because there's no real solution to any of this but suffering through it.

So I need positive stories of pregnancy going super fast / adding another kid being the best choice / even how to make therapy actually helpful. Because it's been 2 days and it feels like my life is over. ",4,1762914595.0,Shouldihaveanother,2,1.0,False

I will try to keep the backstory short. 



So I am an 18 AFB (assigned female at birth) but am queer personally. I'm not opening up to my family, however due to earlier events when I was 14, my parents and my Uncle (63) know that I like any gender. They do NOT know I myself and NB and how queer I am. I was almost 200lbs in November of 2024, however I lost almost 30lbs by January. However this was because I would skip meals and barely eat anything, focusing on the numbers on a scale, and any time I would eat I would feel like I needed to throw up so I just wouldn't. I would go three days not eating almost anything, only having maybe a little fruit, or enough dinner that people wouldn’t question me. I realized this wasn’t healthy and have tried to work on it but sometimes eating still makes me feel sick.



So in January of 2025 I moved out to live with my aunt and uncle at 17, and at first everything was ok, hard but no different than my parents. But gradually things started to change. My uncle always commented on what I ate and when. If I wasn’t hungry so I skipped a meal, he would say that I was only ever eating what I enjoyed. That if it was (insert thing I enjoy) I would have seconds or thirds, and that I needed to be less picky. I love sweets, but I try not to eat too much. Admittedly I am not always great at it as self control has never been a strong suit but I have gotten much better. Living here there are things that were not considered desserts when I was with my parents, and if you eat them here you can’t have dessert. A list of things that are considered any dessert. Any kind of fruit, (except apples.) Smoothies. Juice Jam/jelly of any kind Honey. If you have any of these you can not have dessert, (cake or anything like that). The serving size is half of what it actually says. So if I am caught putting a tablespoon of jam on my sandwich they say “You know peanut butter is actually sweet enough without jam.”



	Some conversations about food I have had with my family, “Do you really want to eat that? Did you know that smoothies are actually sweeter than regular fruit? If you eat the fruit regularly it's actually better for you. I know your parents are overweight and haven't taught you good habits but I'm trying to help you but you only eat what you want when you want it. And if it's something you like you will eat more of it. You need to learn how to eat anything put in front of you. I can help you if you want me too. All you need to do is submit to me and the lord will work through you.” 

“If you eat that you will get diabetes, you could very easily get diabetes just because you only ever want sugar.”  
When I put BBQ sauce on my pulled pork sandwich, “You don’t actually need that. The pork has flavor, all you ever do is add condiments to your food. You don't even know what it actually tastes like.”

	On another note, both of my male cousins were at the time here, and had gotten back from working at a summer camp. They had said they would do the dishes since I had done them throughout the whole week along with all the other chores by myself. My uncle came in at 8pm, I was still working at some school and he asked who was going to do the dishes. I told him the boys said they were going to do it.   
“The boys? You expect them to do all the dishes? They have been working their ass off all week for the summer camp and are now working on (extracurricular) because they are the highest staff for it and incharge of it, I don’t mind doing the dishes since its apparently so hard for you too, but I don’t want the boys doing it.” I said that they had said they would, and he said “I don’t care what they said! You can do it or get the girls to do it but the boys don’t need to be doing it.” So I said that I would do it myself before I went to bed, and I set an alarm for 9pm. (bedtime is 10). So at 8:56pm he came in and snapped and said “Why are the god damn dishes not done?” I said I had an alarm set. I was still working at school and he walked over to me and my computer, put his hand on the back of my screen as if he was going to slam it closed and told me “Get up now and do the dishes.”

	My F cousins and I do the laundry, at the time we didn't have a schedule like now so we were all doing two to four loads twice a week. So sometimes it wasn't done until late. We would get yelled out, and then when we got into our camper, (where all five of us live) we hadn’t done the few dishes, which were almost all from his coffee in the morning, (he makes it with an airopress). And my aunt asked if any of us were going to do them, and he said “Oh don’t worry about it. Since they are so busy with school and we aren’t busy at all with work I just assume you or I will have to wash them tomorrow, and put the laundry away.” 

	My cousin once hadn’t decided if she was going to put her pants in the laundry or not yet because she'd only worn them twice. This went back and forth, he asked when she would decide, she said she had it on her schedule since she was busy with school at the moment. He asked why she couldn’t just decide then, when she said because she was busy at school he walked over, grabbed her pants, walked to the door, slammed it open and threw it onto the ground outside and said “Well they are dirty now, clean them. Don’t let your schedule rule you.” 

	I told my uncle I don’t think I can eat beef because everytime I eat it I get sick, feeling like I'm going to throw up and have bad diarrhea. He said that “Red meat feeds you for the spiritual battle, what do you think it means if you can’t eat it.” and ignore me when we have burgers, or any type of ground beef and just tell me to eat it.

	My aunt told me when I turned the AC on that “This isn’t your home, don’t turn it on without asking”.

	They have told me I am not an adult in their house because in their house I am still a child. Then turn and say “you are an adult now you need to be more responsible.” 

	My mental health has not been in a great place recently, to the point where I scratch myself, or dig my nails into my skin when I get upset or overwhelmed. My uncle would snap at me, and say that I looked depressed, and that I had no reason to be depressed. That I was opening the door to demonic spirits and that I needed to lift my life up to the Lord.

	He came into the room once and asked why the table wasn’t cleaned. I said that was my 15F cousin's things and she was cleaning and he snapped saying that she told him it was my job. And I had to go check. I asked which table, the dining table or the table in our room. He started yelling at me that it didn’t matter which table it was to just go deal with it. Later I asked him why, when I was calm and asked a question, did he go from 1-100, and he paused and said “It’s because you react better when I yell at you.” He told me that if I go into the world with “that attitude” that I would be “beaten and abused”. That I would fail and have to come back because they love me no matter what. 

	My aunt one day jokingly shook my head, both hands on the side of my head and shook me and I said “please don’t touch me.” She said that it was her house and she could do whatever she wanted. I said “I understand that but I am not your house. I am my own being, eighteen, and this is my body and I can ask you not to shake me.” She said in her house she can do whatever she wants.

	My cousin (15f) was talking to my uncle about limits, and how people have to push their limits to get better, and he said that people of our generation don’t know how to push their limits. That his father who was a photographer, following the president broke his leg, walked on it for three days before he passed out and dealt with it and that no one this day and age would do that. My cousin mentioned that last year at the (extracurricular) I broke my leg and no one knew. The medical at the event didn't notice and didn’t treat it properly, leaving me with only a walmart compression sleeve for a fibular spiral fracture all the way through. I walked on it. For a week. Before I went to the doctor. I didn’t drop out of the event, and I kept walking. My uncle said “yeah but she had crutches and pain meds. That doesn’t count.” (they took my crutches away not even 48 hours after I broke my leg.) Then he went on to talk about how his mother was you know what by a family member, as a teen and how she didn’t make a big deal of it and kept going…He said “obviously i dont want that to happen to you but your kind of people can’t push through like she did.”

	At an extracurricular event, an 80 + old man, 80+ grabbed a girl's hair and squeezed it. Twice. I told him that was not appropriate to do and not to touch our people as they are also minors and he said “I must have been born in the wrong generation because in my day and age it was ok to pull a girl's hair.” And I told my uncle how I almost said “Sir it's not that it was ok, it was that they were willing to put up with your bullshit and I am not.” And he said that would have been wrong because older men don't realize. It's not that bad to grab a girl's hair. And he just didn't know. Bullshit, I told him everyone knows you don’t touch someone without consent. And he defended the man. Not the girl.

	I went on a trip with my family, and we went on a hike for 7miles, up and down steep rocks. I hurt my ankle, twisted it multiple times. My uncle and aunt had been there and I made noises when I got hurt but they wanted to keep going so I sucked it up. The next day my leg was in a lot of pain so I was visibly limping trying not to cry. My uncle pulled me aside and said that “You need to stop being so dramatic. When you are offered to do things for others that you don't want to do you get miserable like this” And he did that over exaggeration parents do about being sad :( and slumped his shoulders. And said that “Whenever it's something you want to do it's all of a sudden ok and you don’t hurt anymore.” And then he said “And you are limping and I have to think you must be in either so much pain or you're over reacting. That's why no one knew your leg was broken last year because you over reacted.” (mind you my foot was twice the size, black, actual black and purple and yellow from my ankle down to my toes and up part of my calf.)

	My uncle acted like he was going to hit me. He found out I had told someone I didn’t want to stay with them all summer by myself since my cousins would be working at a summer camp. He found me that night and said “Did you tell (person) you didn’t want to stay with us? Don’t go spreading lies and deceit in my ministry, don't go turn people against me. Don't ruin this program for others and throw our name around, how do you think that makes us look? If you want to do that you can leave.”

	I went to another week long event, and admittedly i fucked up. I got thrown out for being “insabordinate” and went home early. My phone was confiscated and that made sense. But it was for the week…than a second week. And a third. And in the third week I could have my phone for an hour. But if I wanted to call my parents that cut into my hour. Then at four weeks I asked if I could have it back and they said no because I was always too secretive and sat in corners and excluded myself. (I am an introvert but my family doesn't believe in those things). Then after that it was because I didn't offer to help enough. Then it was because they didn't see a change in my heart. 71 days later I got my phone back and every time I had asked the reason changed.

	To this day they still ask what I am doing, I'm not allowed to sit alone with my devices, my computer always has to face a door so if someone walks in they can see what I’m doing. 



I feel like I'm going crazy, and I'm sure I missed some things. Please feel free to ask questions. I just need to know if I'm going crazy.

It sounds like they are discussing a contract but I don't want to be impolite and listen in. The people doing the selling (I don't know how else to call it since I don't know what they are talking about), are working pretty hard to convince the couple. It all looks very serious.

I've signed contracts for houses, and I've signed contracts for loans with my wife, and they are never done in coffee shops.

He was tall—so tall my five-foot-two frame barely reached his chest. He was dressed in a perfectly tailored, three-piece charcoal gray suit that spoke of quiet, astronomical expense. His dark brown hair was immaculately styled, and his features were sharp and severe. But it was his eyes that froze me in place—they were the color of glacial ice, and they were fixed, without a flicker of emotion, on me and the wreckage at my feet.

The temperature in the hallway plummeted.

His gaze swept over the dead keyboard, the coffee-flooded countertop, and finally landed on my face, which was surely a mask of pure terror.

""I-I'm so sorry!"" The words tumbled out in a mortified bow, nearly sending my glasses flying. ""I didn't mean to! The machine, it just—""

He finally spoke. His voice was a low, resonant baritone, as cold and unyielding as his stare. ""That is a Silent Swallow X1. Custom-built. One of a hundred in the world.""

*Silent what? A keyboard named after a bird?*

He glanced at a woman in a black suit who had appeared silently behind him. ""Linda. Calculate the damages. Notify HR.""

Linda, who I would later learn was the formidable Head of HR, was already tapping away on a tablet. ""Keyboard replacement, approximately twelve thousand dollars. Cleanup, estimated at five hundred. Potential data and productivity loss, incalculable,"" she recited, her voice as devoid of emotion as his. ""Miss Emily Chen, intern, ID number R734.""

She knew my name. I felt like a bug under a microscope.

Twelve… *thousand*… dollars? My brain short-circuited trying to do the math. They could sell me into servitude and it wouldn't cover the cost.

""I-I'll pay for it!"" My voice trembled, but I forced myself to stand straight. ""You can deduct it from my salary!""

The man—Alexander Blackwood, the CEO himself—seemed to assess me for a moment, his icy eyes scanning me from head to toe as if evaluating a damaged asset.

""Your entire intern salary, after taxes,"" Linda chimed in, swiping on her tablet, ""would cover the cost in approximately one hundred and twenty-seven years and four months.""

I was going to be sick.

Mr. Blackwood's gaze finally lifted from the coffee graveyard and settled on my face. ""Come with me,"" he commanded, turning back into his office.

Paralyzed, I stood there until Linda’s sharp voice prodded me from behind. ""Miss Chen. Mr. Blackwood is waiting.""

After signing a mountain of paperwork and receiving a temporary ID card and a laptop that felt heavier than my desktop computer at home, I was led to the social media marketing floor.

The workspace was a bustling open-plan office. I carefully set down my bag, pulled out my thermos and… wait. Where was my flash drive?

Not in my pocket. Not in the side pouch. In a mild panic, I dumped the contents of my backpack onto the desk: a notebook, a few pens (one uncapped, leaving a graceful blue arc on my notebook's cover), half a pack of tissues, a crumpled coupon for the campus cafeteria, and… a cold, cylindrical object.

My thermos.

And another object, identical in shape and size to a flash drive, but which was, in fact… a single-serving packet of 3-in-1 instant coffee I’d shoved in my bag that morning.

Disaster. I’d brought a coffee packet instead of my portfolio. My actual flash drive was probably sitting peacefully in my laptop's USB port at home, blinking its lonely blue light.

Thank God for cloud backups. As I frantically logged into the company network, my fellow interns were already clattering away on their keyboards. The pressure was immense.

""Hey, you're new?"" a gentle voice asked.

I looked up to see a guy with impeccably styled hair, a warm smile, and a light blue button-down. His ID badge read: *Ryan Kim, Associate Director, Social Media Marketing.*

""Yes! I'm Emily Chen, the new intern."" I shot up from my chair, nearly knocking it over.

""Relax, Emily,"" Ryan chuckled. His eyes were kind. ""First days are always nerve-wracking. We're a pretty chill department. If you need anything, just ask. Oh, and the coffee machine is over there."" He pointed to a corner of the office.

""Thank you, Director Kim!"" I said, overflowing with gratitude.

""Just Ryan,"" he corrected with a wave, then walked away.

Coffee. I desperately needed caffeine to soothe my frayed nerves and reboot my brain. Clutching my thermos, I headed in the direction he’d pointed. The machine was a high-end model, but after a moment of study, I managed to brew a decent Americano. It was a definite upgrade from my 3-in-1 packet.

As I turned to head back, I noticed a set of imposing double doors at the far end of the hallway. Next to it stood an even sleeker, more futuristic-looking coffee machine, gleaming with a metallic sheen. And, crucially, that corner was deserted.

My curiosity got the better of me. I walked over.

This machine was the Rolls-Royce of coffee makers. It had a touch screen, an array of exotic coffee beans on display, and silent, seamless operation. ""Just one cup,"" my inner demon whispered.

I placed my thermos under the spout and selected 'Latte' on the screen. The machine hummed to life, the rich aroma of freshly ground beans filling the air. Everything was going perfectly, until…

I must have hit the wrong button. Or maybe my three-year-old thermos, with its slightly warped rim, wasn't perfectly aligned.

With a sudden, violent *hiss*, a torrent of brown liquid erupted from the machine—not a gentle stream, but a high-pressure coffee waterfall. It completely missed my thermos, drenching a sleek, wireless keyboard on the adjacent counter. Droplets splattered everywhere, even onto the closed double doors.

""Oh my God!"" I yelped, fumbling to salvage the situation, only to knock over my thermos, adding my half-cup of Americano to the disaster.

The keyboard was submerged, brown liquid pooling between the keys. The air was thick with the smell of burnt coffee and my impending doom. I was frozen in horror.

And then, the heavy double doors slid open with a whisper.",1,1762913779.0,TheCEOsWifeNovel,1,1.0,False

I'm twenty-four, a fresh graduate from a perfectly average state university, and today is my first day as a social media marketing intern at Blackwood Technologies—the undisputed titan of the tech industry.

My mood is a direct reflection of my perpetually untamable, curly brown hair: a chaotic explosion of anxiety and excitement.

""Stay positive, Emily. You got this,"" I muttered, pumping a fist at my own reflection in the subway window. I tried to widen the eyes behind my black-framed glasses, a futile attempt to fight off the exhaustion from a late-night cram session on company history. At five-foot-two, squished in the morning rush hour crowd, I felt less like a future professional and more like a potato about to be trampled.

My carefully chosen ""battle armor"" for the day consisted of a slightly faded university sweatshirt, layered under my one and only professional-looking dark denim jacket. Below that, my uniform of reliable blue jeans and canvas sneakers. As impeccably dressed professionals in sharp suits and click-clacking heels swept past me, I instinctively tightened my shoelaces.

My strengths? A bottomless well of optimism and a knack for occasionally—or let's be honest, frequently—wildly creative ideas. My weaknesses? Well, in the words of my best friend Chloe, I have ""the data sensitivity of a T-Rex trying to connect to Wi-Fi"" and a complete inability to ""figure out who to mute in a group chat.""

My backpack was stuffed with a brainstorming doc I’d pulled an all-nighter on, and a thermos full of my ""elixir of inspiration"" (extra-strong instant coffee). I patted my pocket, confirming the presence of my trusty flash drive—it held my resume, portfolio, and, just in case, I had a backup in the cloud.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped into the towering, steel-and-glass monolith that was Blackwood Technologies headquarters. The lobby was cavernous, its marble floors so polished they mirrored the hurried footsteps of people who spoke in clipped, efficient tones. The air buzzed with an unspoken mantra: *time is money, and you’re wasting mine.*

The receptionist, her makeup flawless and smile calibrated to a perfect 90-degree angle, directed me without looking up. ""Interns, third floor, HR.""

1ousw0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ousw0v/aio_to_a_regular_whos_making_me_uncomfortable/,AIO to a regular who's making me uncomfortable?,"So some context- I am in my early 20s, trans, and work in a cafe inside of a big building. There is a regular that's nearly 40 that comes in 3 times a day minimum. He works in the same building as me so that didn't put me off at all, but every time he'd approach me while I'm on a break or unexpectedly somewhere else I'd jump super bad for some reason.

  
I started working here approximately 2 months ago, and have slowly gotten to know all our regulars. I am very friendly but pretty shy of getting into conversation with customers, so whenever this guy came in I'd scurry away and make his food/coffee while my coworkers talked to him. 

A couple weeks ago he came in while I was alone, and after taking his order he leaned in and went ""By the way, your hairs messed up"". I fixed it and he left. Then the next day it was Halloween and I was wearing a ratatouille rat thing on my head and he said ""Your hairs messed up again"" and it was funny but felt like a little flirtatious? He also bussed a table for some reason and then as I was checking him out for something he said ""I bet you don't even know anything you're so young."" and I said ""What? I'm probably older than you think I am."" (I look about 17- like the trans baby face yk) he asked me how old I am and i told him and he leaned down and said said ""Well, I'm almost 40, so there's a pretty big gap between us..."" And that felt odd?

From that point it felt like the way he spoke to me was really condescending and like I'm a child, and he's kept bringing up my age and the difference between us.  
The next day he came in and went ""Oh great, my favorites working today!"" and ordered some drink or something. I was talking with my coworker about existential crisiss' and he said ""Oh I've had so many, I'm almost 40."" He came in again later while I was in a rush w/o my coworker and came behind the counter to talk to me. I really hate when people come behind the counter so that felt like a big deal to me. He came in around 5 times that day for just random things idk.

  
The next day when my boss went on break she would walk right by his office, and he came in both times she went on break right after she left. He spent her entire break in the shop and he has never spent extended time inside before. When he came in, he saw that i had a 3ds and went ""How long have you had that thing"" and I said around 12 years and he went ""Wow- you must've been really really little..."" then looked me up and down and went ""well- littler than you are right now..."" I ignored him and he said ""You must've been like 8. I was enrolling in the military then."" It felt like a weird comment. Then later he came in again when my coworker was back and was like talking to her about me in front of me like you do with a child.

  
Then the next day I was trying to not interact with him and let him just talk to my coworkers. I guess he got annoyed because he whined my name and went ""Why don't you make them stop bullying meee?"" Also every time i hand him anything his hand goes fully over mine and it feels intentional but that isn't anything substantive I can prove. 

  
I feel a lot of fear that I'm delusional or overreacting. I had been groomed pretty badly from 17-19 and am now really on edge about this stuff. I'm worried I'm way overthinking this and that he's just some normal dude that I'm projecting my anxieties onto. I recognize that even if what he said is weird that it's almost nothing and not a big deal. But he's brought up my age and how different in age we are and how small I am almost every day since we started talking more. It makes me feel weird and self conscious and objectified. Like I'm being infantilized and flirted with at the same time. Any takes on this would be awesome, thanks! 

TL;DR: A man who works in my building has been coming in and commenting on the age difference between him and I, telling me how little I am and hanging around more than usual. I cant tell if I'm making a big deal out of nothing.

My husband sexually assaulted me despite me telling him no and stop. That was what made me start to see how bad my marriage was. We have a son, age 1, and I can’t let him grow up in a home like this. 

When I tried to have a calm conversation with his father he ended up trying to make excuses and play “pity me” essentially before going outside and punching a bunch of stuff so loudly I could hear it from inside. I was in an abusive relationship in high school so the assault, and then the punching, was really triggering for me.

It all made me realize how badly I have needed to get out. He is the breadwinner of the family for context. I always make sure our son has what he needs: snacks, food, formula, diapers, wipes, etc. His dad just leaves dirty diapers lying around, and in the crib with our son, and it drives me crazy. Plus it is SO unsanitary. 

He also doesn’t seem to take fatherhood seriously or view it as a priority as he will always do something other than spend time with our son or he will just take him to his parents house to “share the load”. 

I also only eat one meal a day because it is all we can afford. He will hide money from me so he can get coffee in the morning and then he proceeds to eat my leftovers in the fridge that I try to save so I can have at least two meals for one day. 

He also has confessed to having harmful thoughts about my son and I. I am constantly in severe burnout to where I have no energy to do anything and my physical health is taking a toll as evidenced by my vitamin deficiencies. 

I am planning on leaving but I don’t have the funds to and my family is all out of state. He has agreed to let me take our son to my home state for a while but I know I won’t want to come back. I’ve been documenting everything and will seek legal counsel.  I know I will end up in the hospital if I keep going like this. Either due to my own health failing me or at his hands. 

I never imagined my life would be like this but my son deserves to be in a house that isn’t full of fear and resentment, where he won’t feel the need to make extravagant displays just to get his own fathers attention, and where he will be truly loved for all he is and never feel less than. 

I will always care for my son’s father but I genuinely cannot keep going like this. I even asked him if he felt comfortable in the situation and he said yes. He lives as if he is living alone and not with a wife and child. I can’t wait to get out and give our son the life he truly deserves. ",3,1762913464.0,Vent,4,0.8,False

So, there is this woman 20 years my junior she works in the OR and I am in a different department. I have a friend who is from the same place I am from Jersey. He has been in TX since ‘01. I’ve only been here 4 years. He and I commiserate over coffee a few times a day. I pass through the OR multiple times a day, and I take bio and trash. If I am passing through and a case has finished I will wait outside door and take the bags so they don’t have to walk it to the soiled utility. So, this girl and I have always been friendly since I will take the bags from her. Two weeks ago she complimented me highly on how I treat her; I said thank you as usual then I I complimented her back. She took a double take and Idk what she even said to me. I just thanked her and went on my way. After that situation she has done this one thing in front of me 4 times since then. Here is the crux of the story! Yesterday was the 4th time she did this, and I am not sure how to take it or leave it. She came out of one of the rooms into the hall and decided to pull up her scrub top and show skin about 6 inches; than decides to put both hands in her pants looked as if she was playing grab ass. After she touches her ass she pulls her hands out. Her scrub pants have been pushed down a bit so she pulls them up a bit and then lets her top down. After its all said and done she turns around to look at me directly in the eyes. Now the look she gives me is this come hither stare. At least that’s how my mother raised me on reading women’s body language and cues. My big thing I would like to know is why would she do this only in front of me? I have asked my friend and few others I have made friends with up there and they have never seen her do that before. I was already going to properly ask her on a date anywho and see where things lead. I just don‘t what this ass grab thing to turn into a HR problem when it doesn’t need to be. 

Thank you for responding.

I'm hoping to share my story and maybe connect with some of you who've felt the same. It's been a rollercoaster of a journey, trying to get my Amazon business off the ground. Like many of you, I've stayed up into the early hours, guzzling lukewarm coffee, staring at my dwindling savings. There were moments when I poured everything into features I thought would catch fire, only to realize no one even noticed. It's tough feeling like you're building in a vacuum, with no feedback and even fewer sticky users.

I'm constantly hit with the doubt. Is this just a shiny distraction or can it become a real business? It stings more seeing other founders out there shipping faster, and getting noticed while I feel stuck in neutral. I believe in my project, though some days it feels like whispering into a void.

On top of it all, content creation has been a headache. Early on, I tried creating engaging videos manually, but it consumed so much time and energy. Recently, I stumbled across tools like HypeCaster, which promise to automate video creation and help maintain content consistency. It's been a game changer, for whatever that's worth.

I'm at a crossroads now, debating whether to call it quits or push harder. Have any of you faced this moment? How did you pull through? Could really use some insight from this awesome community.

1ousmjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TTC_PCOS/comments/1ousmjd/patience_is_a_virtue/,Patience is a virtue?,"I am a planner by nature. I spend hours creating the itineraries for all our vacations, I host large scale company events coordinating volunteers like an orchestrator, I have folders on all my social media platforms for every possible scenario that I might find myself in one day. I find comfort and safety in knowing. Knowing all the possibilities and knowing what l will do in every version of “what if”. The hardest part of this journey so far is the NOT knowing. 

My first OBGYN appointment was three days after my first missed period. I had been off birth control for 6 months and was convinced I must be pregnant, so I requested a blood test to confirm. Yeah all my home tests *must* be wrong, because they are all negative. Blood test was negative too, of course. So I waited and waited and tested and tested. By my third missed period, I was told that I likely had PCOS. That was in the summer. In August, I got a new job and was between insurances for a few months during the new hire waiting period. My OBGYN told me if I wanted to wait til I was eligible for coverage, I could get my bloodwork and ultrasound done in 3 months, but until then just focus on diet and exercise. She literally said “just google PCOS diet and do that til November.” so I did. Of course it hasn’t been easy and I didn’t do it perfectly, but I’ve lost about 8 pounds since then and I’m trying to stay on track.

On October 16th I went home from work early. I was feeling lightheaded and have a medical history of passing out. Vasovagal syncope, it’s a thing and it’s really annoying. When I got home, I went to the restroom, and started crying tears of joy when I saw that I had started my period. For the first time in seven months. I felt hope again, and even the symptoms from hell couldn’t get me down. We tried to guess our ovulation time based on past cycles, and waited, hoping for the best. My period is supposed to start in the next few days and every negative test is a stab to the heart. 

Now that you’re caught up, here’s what broke me most recently. Today was my first ultrasound and honestly, it was devastating. There was no bad news, but on a day that I was really hoping to get closer to some answers, I was told that it would be another month before my OBGYN had an open appointment to discuss my results with me. Between the disappointment of walking away yet again with zero answers and the hole in my heart that seemed to grow 10x bigger & deeper with every pregnant mama who walked out of the exam room holding her belly with one hand and her ultrasound pictures in another, it was just such a rough day for me. Going back to work after that was so hard and everyone could see I was a mess. But what could I do? I distracted myself with the tasks of the day and kept going. My godsend of a husband brought me a coffee. My kind boss who also struggled with infertility said to let her know if there’s anything she can do. But the emptiness is still there.

Is this ever going to end? I don’t know. And that’s the hardest part. ",2,1762912945.0,TTC_PCOS,0,1.0,False

And why these characters im showing on screen will never be the best in their survivor categories.

007n7: The worst trickster I’ve seen in my life.
Did you know that 007n7 used to have slowness 1 for 6 seconds when doing clone and that ability had a 50 second cooldown. Maybe they told themselves that escaping chase easily needs more risk. Problem: even to this day 007n7 is probably the worst survivor. His clones are not convincing at all and even if you lose 7n7 you can just use a detection ability after the 4.5 seconds of undetectable runs out. Coolgui is mediocre as if the killer has time to hit you before you teleport: YOU. ARE. FUCKED! The only thing 007n7 is good at is to keep hiding until lms but most detection abilities have a shorter cooldown than 7n7’s clone. 
""Oh but clone parrying exists"" it’s literally just like a guest block you can wait it out or still kill 007n7 with slasher if you use behead.

Guest 1337: Veteran unc needs some rest.
Anyone who has ever played guest has been in a situation where they try to block the killer, hilariously fails and dies 10 seconds later. Guest is a noob trap, both for the people playing him and for new killers, the new guest player thinks he is op because he can stun and get short invincibility plus the edits he may have seen on tiktok or youtube of guest mains absolutely rocking the killer’s shit. But then they get in game and die. Or even the new killers fighting against guest. They can find out after getting parried 2 to 4 times that guest is actually blocking the attack and that they need to anticipate it. And what happens next is milestone 3 and 4 guests emoting instead of helping because they are too scared of instantly dying if they try helping. Even iced coffee, a youtuber who is called by a lot of people the best guest main, still dies often due to missing his blocks.",3,1762912615.0,FORSAKENROBLOX,3,1.0,False

My (Egyptian) husband works 6-7 days a week, at least 10 hours every day, (no overtime pay or benefits btw, because he works for another Egyptian guy) so I see him for like an hour tops every evening. Since I started my new job, I'm off weekends, and he has to work every single weekend, so we haven't had a day off together in 2 months. On top of that, he's about to get a second job so that we can get fertility benefits (trying to get pregnant since April), and even though I told him he should make sure he gets at least 1 day a week off, he won't do it because the Egyptian guy he works for is pressuring him and really mad that he's getting the second job. Over the past several weeks I've lost my appetite like crazy, I eat maybe like an English muffin for lunch and like 2 eggs gor dinner, and on the weekends I don't eat all day because I don't have a designated lunch hour reminding me to eat. I have crazy ridges in my fingernails and when I had a UTI recently they also found ketones in my urine. (Ftr my BMI is like 35-40, I'm definitely not anorexic.) After work I just go home and sit under a blanket, sometimes I watch something on Netflix but it's getting harder to care enough to pick something. I drink tea and coffee and that's pretty much the only thing I consistently feel motivated to injest. I just feel like I'm withering away inside, and I'm so full of negative thoughts about the past. I don't actively want to d13 but I've just become so disconnected from the idea of enjoying life. I have family in an adjoining state about 4 hours away, and my in-laws about 40 mines away, but it's hard to talk to them about depression because of the cultural difference. I've been having diarrhea between 2-4 times a day (a few days it was 5 times) for the past 3-5 weeks. I also just found out my COBRA coverage is increasing by $400 a month. I'm so frustrated with this new job because they told me I'd have benefits after 30 days but even though I started in September turns out I won't get benefits until January. Just feeling so hopeless about every aspect of my life.",1,1762912492.0,depression,0,1.0,False

StatusDevTeam
Hey everybody -

Some of you might have followed the discussion I had with members of the Discord yesterday. We had an internal team discussion and have decided to share a bit more with you guys so everyone can understand why we are taking the current steps.

These points are meant to build on top of our previous announcement, and everything said there still applies.
First, it's important to understand that a free app is ""financed"" by its paying users. The more free stuff we give out (number of free actions per day), the more paying users have to pay to have the app as a whole breakeven (revenue >= cost).

Second, here are our rough costs and revenues. I'll preface by saying our COSTS are in USD$. Some people have mentioned that where they live X$ is a lot. Yes, we understand that, but at the end of the day our costs are in USD$ and that's not something we can change. Therefore, we have to base our prices in USD$ to cover our costs in USD$.

As of last month, **the average cost per user is about 5x higher than the average revenue per user.** This means the app is running at a loss. Users who use many actions a day, or across multiple accounts, cost much more to support. As a reference, only a small portion of users actually use more than 20 actions per day.

Third, we are more and more weighting towards making the app pay-to-play, period. Making it so would mean paying users would get more actions per $ they spend because they don't have to ""finance"" the free users.

Fourth, following our drop from 50 actions to 20 actions/day earlier this week, our overall costs have decreased while our revenue has increased, down to about 3.5x the cost versus revenue (1x = breakeven). This is progress, but still not enough to reach breakeven. Our plan now is to gradually decrease the number of daily actions until we reach sustainability. This is a quick immediate step we can take: adding a subscription-based system is more complex as it requires app changes to support.

In summary, we will most likely be moving to a pay-to-play model gradually. We had already polled the Discord in the past around this discussion, and in general a small amount of users are ready to pay to play. Unfortunately for users that cannot afford to pay, they won't be able to play anymore. Fortunately for users that can afford to pay, it will be less costly at that moment to have a subscription than to pay for coffees. 

What's coming up:
- Starting tomorrow, the number of free actions will be reduced by an additional 2. This process will repeat every 2 to 5 days as we track our cost -vs- revenue.
- In the coming month, we will decide on the best long-term course of action: most probably a subscription based system. This requires more time to develop and implement in the app which is why we can't simply do it right now.",0,1762912433.0,statusAI,1,0.36,False

But it’s a bag and at a large-ish volume of liquid it’s not the best - the bag crumples etc. Then when I take the first like 30% that goes through and try to pour it back over the top now that all the curds are settled and filtering, well just pouring it in  disturbs all the curds and I get more unfiltered liquid going through again.  Several iterations of that then it I remove the bag and put in a giant coffee filter - goes through that a few times (new filter each time of course). It’s just not a great setup. I can’t quite find the perfect selection of containers and filtering media to make it easier, and hopefully something to help soften the stream of liquid when pouring back over the milk curds to refilter.

Hi! I’m a 23F college student who always lacks sleep and rest because of studying 😭. For the last 3-4 months, I observed that I bought 20 tablets of paracetamol that I consumed within a month. I take it when I have, or feel like I’m going to have, a fever. And my sickness came frequently last October 🥹 I consulted with a physician the previous month because of fever and she prescribed me paracetamol and vitamins. I fear I might have organ failure if I continue relying on paracetamol 😣. But the remaining month of the year is so crucial for me to pass this semester huhu so I can’t help but take an all-nighter 🥺 What can I do?

Other info about me:
- I only take Centrum multivitamins daily. I will change it to Stresstabs because it was prescribed to me recently.
- Recently, I underwent a blood chemistry test and my results are ok (borderline).
- I eat healthily as much as possible. My daily meal consists of multi-grain rice (lentils, quinoa, chickpeas) and home-cooked dishes that are not frozen goods as much as possible.
- I don’t drink alcohol. And I don’t take much coffee because I easily palpitate especially when I am almost always lacking sleep.
- Nowadays, I exercise only whenever my body feels stiff.  But if not too busy, I exercise every other day 🥹",1,1762912208.0,AskDocs,6,1.0,False

1ousbr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ousbr4/im_a_freediver_theres_a_place_in_the_kelp_forest/,I’m a Freediver. There’s a Place in the Kelp Forest Where the Fish Won’t Go and My Friend Disappeared.,"I don’t dive kelp anymore.

I still freedive—pools, sandy bottoms, clear blue drop-offs where you can see the bottom from the surface—but not kelp. Not where the light turns into broken beams and you can’t see what’s behind the stalk next to your face.

If you looked at my Instagram, you’d think I was lying. There’s a video on there from last year: bright morning off the Central Coast, flat ocean, a six-pack charter boat rocking lazily on a kelp bed. You can see me and my buddy Tom doing warm-up drops off a float, sea lions looping around the hull. All very “ocean therapy” vibes.

There’s nothing from below fifteen meters in that forest. I deleted all of that.

The official story is that Tom blacked out at depth and got tangled. “Freediver error.” Our fault. The report doesn’t mention the band of dead water where the fish wouldn’t go. Or the thing that pulled on our float line like it was checking what we were.

It was Tom’s idea to book that trip.

We’d both finished a level-two freediving course a month earlier down in La Jolla. Passed our thirty-meter dives. Learned how not to die in blackout scenarios. Came home with new dive watches and an inflated sense of our own competence.

Tom went all-in. Sold his longboard to buy carbon fins. Started DMing comp divers he followed like he was networking now. He wanted depth records and sponsor tags. I just wanted to stop feeling like my lungs were going to explode at ten meters.

“Glass out there,” he texted me that morning. “Harbor webcams look like a lake. You working?”

I was off. I had my phone in one hand and a mug of coffee from the office Keurig in the other. My boss had just dropped the schedule for the next two weeks on my desk: wall-to-wall shifts.

“If I say no, will you leave me alone?” I wrote back.

He sent a selfie from the dock instead of answering. Thick black 5mm suit peeled down to his waist, hood hanging. Behind him: a faded white charter boat with KATE LYNN painted on the stern in chipped blue letters, and a captain who looked like he’d been carved out of sun damage and cigarettes.

“Spot’s paid for,” the caption read. “You can nap on the way out.”

I stared at my calendar for another second, thought about two weeks of fluorescent lights and stale break room air, and caved.

“Give me thirty,” I typed. “Don’t let the captain leave without my pretty face.”

The harbor was quiet when I got there. Gulls yelling over the fish processing plant, a couple of guys pushing carts of tanks down the dock, diesel and salt in the air. The kind of morning brochures like to pretend is every morning.

KATE LYNN bobbed at the slip. The captain checked our names off a clipboard, then did the safety spiel in the bored tone of someone who’s done it four times a week for twenty years.

“Life jackets under the bench, O₂ here, first aid kit here,” he said, tapping each box with a knuckle. “If you’re gonna pass out, try not to do it under the boat. You guys are just breath-holders, right? No tanks?”

“Just freediving,” Tom said, grinning. “We brought our own float and line. We’ll stay on it.”

The captain looked at the orange float at Tom’s feet, the coiled hundred-foot line, the small anchor clipped to the end. He grunted.

“Every guy says he’ll stay on the line,” he said. “Every season someone chases a fish and makes me call the Coast Guard. You wanna screw around, do it on someone else’s boat. We clear?”

“Yes, sir,” Tom said, still smiling. He always smiled when someone challenged him. It was like a reflex.

We motored out of the harbor, around the breakwater, and into low, gentle swell. The water outside was stupidly calm—small rolling bumps, no whitecaps. The kind of day you talk about for months afterward.

“Gonna drop you boys on the outside edge of the big bed,” the captain yelled over the engine, pointing at a darker patch ahead of us. “Sounder says twenty-eight meters. Lots of bait and bass under the canopy. You’ll have company.”

Tom practically vibrated. “Dude, if the viz is even decent, this is gonna be sick,” he said in my ear. “You brought your slate, right?”

I tapped the little white plastic board clipped to my belt. “Yeah, yeah. I brought your underwater notepad.”

He’d made fun of me when I bought it—“what, you gonna write poetry at twenty meters?”—until he got tired of having to surface every time I wanted to tell him something.

We passed over the kelp bed. From above, it looked like a thick mat of bronze coins, glossy in the morning sun. Sea lions popped their heads up and watched us go by, glistening and smug.

The captain put us on the outside edge, where the kelp thinned enough that you could swim between stalks without sawing your mask strap off. He killed the engine, the boat settled, and the hull started its slow, rhythmic roll.

We suited up. I pulled my 5mm over my shoulders, smeared spit in my mask, checked my snorkel clip. Tom fussed with his GoPro mount, making sure the little camera on his forehead was angled just right.

“Record or it didn’t happen,” he said, tapping it.

“Just don’t headbutt the boat,” I said. “Those videos are harder to monetize.”

He laughed, hopped to the transom, and did a clean flat-back entry into the water. I followed less gracefully. The cold slid down the back of my suit in that way it always does the first time, like someone poured ice along my spine. Then the neoprene sealed and it was bearable.

We swam the float a few meters into the bed and dropped the anchor weight between a cluster of kelp holdfasts, careful not to wrap the line around anything. The line hung down into the green.

I put my face in the water and forgot about the boat for a second.

Kelp is different from the top than it is from inside. On the surface it’s a mat. Underneath, it’s a vertical forest. Thick stalks rising from the bottom in tight groups, blades streaming out like flags in the swell. Sunlight slants down between them, turning the water gold and green.

Ten meters down, I could see fish already. Blacksmith, little rockfish, bright orange Garibaldi. A sea lion shot past, just a blur of smooth muscle.

It was beautiful. It was exactly the kind of setting you see in freediving videos with soothing music and inspirational captions.

That’s the problem with a lot of horror: if you freeze-frame it early, it looks like a screensaver.

We started with warm-ups.

Tom grabbed the line first, floated face-down for a couple of minutes, slowing his breathing. Then he jackknifed, did a clean duck dive, and started pulling himself down hand-over-hand, fins trailing.

I watched his long black fins disappear into the kelp’s lower levels. The forest swallowed him quickly.

My watch ticked time on my wrist. Twenty seconds. Thirty. Forty-five.

He came back up after maybe a minute, blew out, and did his recovery breathing, short exhales and big inhales like we’d been taught.

“Clear,” he said between puffs. He pulled his mask up for a second, eyes bright. “Man, it’s insane down there. Like a real forest. Big bait balls at ten, fifteen. Bass cruising through. You’re gonna lose your mind.”

I wasn’t sure if that was the phrase I wanted to hear. I tugged my mask back into place anyway.

“I’ll go to fifteen,” I said. “Stretch my ears out. Don’t move the float.”

He saluted.

I floated face-down, filling and emptying my lungs at a slow, steady rhythm. You can feel your heart rate drop if you pay attention, like someone letting off a brake pedal.

One more inhale—comfortably full, not max—and I tipped forward, hands sliding down the line.

The water closed over my head. Sounds from the boat dulled, replaced by the small noises of my own exhale and the creak of kelp.

I equalized every meter or two, pinching my nose and puffing gently until the pressure behind my sinuses eased. The light dimmed, turned greener.

Around ten meters, I passed into the busy zone. Schools of anchovy flickered between blades. A Garibaldi rushed up to my mask, turned, and flashed his orange side at me like a dare. Small rockfish hung near the stalks, their fins barely moving.

I stopped around fifteen, one hand on the rope, and just hung there.

Below me, the forest went on. Stalks thickened, closer together. The beams of light thinned. The bottom was somewhere another ten, twelve meters down from where I was, hidden in shade.

And below where I hung, past maybe twenty meters, the movement… stopped.

Up where I was, life was everywhere. Little flicks of silver, flashes of color, shadows of larger fish pushing through the schools.

Down there, there was nothing. No bass. No perch. No crabs on the holdfasts. Just kelp blades swaying in slow motion.

If there had been no fish anywhere, I’d have blamed temperature or oxygen or something else we learned about in passing. But the line was sharp. As if something had drawn a horizontal cutoff and everything with gills got the memo.

The hair on my neck prickled under my hood.

My lungs tapped me on the shoulder, reminding me I wasn’t down there on a tank. I turned, looked up, and pulled myself back to the surface.

Breaking through is usually a small relief. This time it felt like getting pulled out of a room you’d walked into by mistake.

“How’s it look?” Tom asked, hooking one arm over the float.

“Pretty,” I said. “And weird. Lots of activity up top. Nothing below twenty. Like a desert.”

He frowned behind his mask. “Like dead?”

“Not dead. Just empty.” I hesitated, then added, “Feels… wrong. Like it shouldn’t be that sharp.”

He shrugged. “Thermocline, maybe. Fish hang where the food and temp line up. You want the deep zone left to us.”

I tugged my slate up, flipped it around, and wrote:

FISH STOP AT 20

NOTHING MOVES LOWER

GIVES ME A BAD FEELING

I handed it over.

He read it, then tapped his pencil against the plastic for a second, thinking.

COULD BE TEMP / O₂

I’LL GO LOOK CLOSER

STAY ON LINE

He flashed me an okay sign, took a couple of big breaths, and dipped under again.

I watched his fins track down the line. Five meters. Ten. Fifteen. The schools parted around him.

He passed my strange “boundary” and kept going, into the emptiness.

At around twenty-five meters, he let go of the line and drifted a little to the side, turning slowly like he was panning for the camera.

I held the rope and saw him hang there, a dark shape in the green, a little cloud of bubbles escaping his hood and climbing toward me.

He stayed longer than I liked. Tom could do two-minute dives in class when he was focused, but this was cold water, a thick suit, current.

I shifted my grip on the line, not pulling, just… ready.

Something moved below him.

It was just at the edge of what I could see. A long, pale shape, thicker than any fish I’ve seen here, slid between two clusters of kelp at maybe thirty meters. I thought at first it was a trick of the light—the way shadows shift when surge moves the blades.

Then it turned.

Fish bend. Eels bend. Their whole body curves in one line.

This thing’s movement was segmented. One part of it seemed to pivot first, then the next, then the next, like someone turning a stack of boxes one at a time.

I couldn’t see a head. Just length and those strange jointed turns.

My hand went automatically to the handle of the knife on my belt, making sure it was still there.

The pale shape angled up, a little, and stopped. I had the horrible, specific sensation that it was… listening. The way a dog cocks its head when it hears a sound you don’t.

I looked down the line for Tom.

I didn’t see him at first. Just the kelp. Just the band of nothing.

Then a hand slid onto the rope from below, gloved fingers wrapping tight. His other hand followed. He started pulling himself up with powerful, calm motions. No panic.

He surfaced a couple of meters from the float, blew out, and did his recovery breathing, eyes closed.

“Big sand bass,” he said after a few breaths, laughing a little. “Just out of range. And yeah, dude, that band is freaky. It’s like someone drew a line where the world stops.”

I didn’t mention what I’d seen under him. I wasn’t ready to give it a name out loud. Not yet.

“Let’s maybe not hang in it,” I said instead. “We can stay in the busy part.”

He squinted at me. “You good?”

“I’m fine,” I lied. “I just don’t want to stack deep dives on an empty stomach. Couple of shallower ones, then I wanna go annoy the captain.”

He snorted. “You and your ‘don’t die’ kick. One more deep for me, you stay at fifteen like a safety diver. That cool?”

My slate was still in my hand. I almost wrote NO in big letters and held it in his face.

Instead I wrote:

YOU STAY ON LINE

I STAY ABOVE YOU

ONE MORE, THEN SHALLOW ONLY

He tapped the OK sign against it, then against his own chest, like he was swearing an oath.

We did the next one together.

We floated side by side for a minute, breathing slow. Inhale, exhale, long pauses, feeling our heart rates settle. The surface layer was cold enough along my cheeks that my lips were slightly numb.

“Last deep,” he said, mostly out of habit.

We both took a final inhale, duck-dived, and grabbed the line.

It feels different when two people are on the same rope. You can feel the small added tension, the tiny shifts when one of you kicks a little harder. His fins were just below me, flashing in my peripheral vision.

Five meters, ten. The kelp closed around us like pillars in a strange cathedral. Fish flared away, then drifted back in.

At eighteen meters, the water temperature dropped. I felt it slide into my hood and along my jaw, a clean, sharp chill. I equalized. So did he; I could hear the faint crackle.

At twenty-two, we crossed into the empty band. The busy world of flickers and shadows ended. Below: dim green-brown stillness.

We hung there for a second, both holding the rope, looking down.

I don’t know what he saw that I didn’t. Maybe the thing moved differently for him. Maybe something passed closer.

All I know is his eyes went from normal to wide behind his mask in a heartbeat, pupils big and flat.

He didn’t bolt. A panicked diver kicks. He just stopped, fingers going white on the line.

My own heart rate spiked. Every part of me that wasn’t brain wanted to twist around and look behind me. Training said don’t spin around in kelp like an idiot.

I didn’t turn. I slid closer and wrapped my off hand around his forearm.

He flinched, then looked at me. Little bubbles leaked from his nose as he exhaled more than he should have.

I pointed up. Exaggerated. The “we go now” sign.

He hesitated longer than I liked, then nodded and started up, slow and controlled.

We rose through the empty band, through the cooler water, back into the busy zone. Fish reappeared. The light brightened.

Something brushed my fin.

Not kelp. I know what kelp feels like—soft, slick, a little give.

This was firmer. Cooler in a different way. It slid along the blade from toe to heel and then was gone, too deliberate to be surge.

Every muscle in my body wanted to kick hard and get away from whatever that was. I forced my legs to keep their slow rhythm. Fast, sloppy kicks waste oxygen. I needed that more than I needed distance.

We broke the surface and did our recovery breaths. My hands shook a little on the float.

“You feel that?” he asked, breathy. “Something big moved down there. Like… like a log in a current.”

“Something touched my fin,” I said, throat dry. “Slid along it. Not kelp.”

“Probably just a seal,” he said automatically, then seemed to hear himself. There had been no seal silhouettes on that dive.

I pulled up my slate, wrote with my hand cramping tight:

I DON’T LIKE THIS

WE SHOULD GO BACK TO BOAT

He read it, looked at the boat—tiny and a little too far away for my taste—and made a face.

CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT

1–2 MORE SHALLOW ONLY

THEN WE BAIL

I wanted to say no. I really did. But you don’t go from “we’re fine” to “trip over” easily, especially when you’re out there on someone else’s time.

“Shallow,” I said. “Nothing below ten. Stay where we can see the hull. If anything pulls the line again, I’m out.”

“Deal,” he said. He actually stuck his hand out above water. I slapped it.

We unclipped the anchor weight and swam the float a bit closer to the edge of the bed, where the kelp thinned and the surface light punched down more cleanly. I could see the underside of the KATE LYNN now, the ladder, the hull rolling.

We did a few easy dives. Eight, ten meters, weaving in and out of the upper canopy. Anchovy schools glittered in the sunbeams. A sea lion rocketed by once, close enough that I felt the pressure wave on my suit.

For a bit, I almost managed to relax. I still checked the nothing-band every time I looked down. It was still there, a horizontal limit where all the life stopped as if cut off.

On the surface between drops, Tom was buzzing.

“Dude, this footage is going to be insane,” he said. “If I don’t look like a total kook, I’m gonna cut together a clip for that brand contest.”

“Make sure you tag ‘screamed internally,’” I said. “Accurate hashtag.”

He laughed and ducked his face back in the water.

I was floating on my back, staring at the sky, when the first big wrong thing happened.

The float jerked.

Not a little bob from swell. A hard, sudden yank from below that pulled part of the buoy under and dragged it a full foot toward the forest’s center.

The rope between my hand and the float went tight enough that the nylon creaked.

I rolled over fast, mask snapping back down, heart jumping into my throat. Tom had just broken the surface by the float, half a body length away, so I knew it wasn’t him pulling on anything.

The line dipped under my hand again, harder. The float dunked, water washing over its top. The clips on its sides rattled.

“Grab the line,” I said, out of breath even though I was on the surface.

“Dude, let go if it’s snagged—” he started.

The tension vanished.

The rope went slack, then slowly straightened again in the gentle surface swell.

I peered down along it.

The anchor weight we’d unclipped was clipped to the float now, so there was nothing heavy on the end. The line just hung, disappearing into the green.

Between two stalks about ten meters down, the light bent slightly. Something pale slid away from the rope, deeper into the kelp. I caught the jointed, segmented way it moved again before it vanished into shadow.

It had been holding our line and then decided to let go.

I didn’t think. I pulled the whole length up hand-over-hand until the end snapped out of the water. No kelp wrapped around it. No debris. Just the bare, wet rope.

“I’m done,” I said. My voice sounded flat. “That’s it. I’m going back to the boat.”

Tom opened his mouth, then shut it. For the first time since we’d left the harbor, he really looked at my face.

“Okay,” he said. He sounded like he meant it. “Okay. Let me do one last pass under the canopy and then we both go in, yeah? Just shallow. I won’t even go past the first holdfasts.”

He said it like a smoker promising to only have one more cigarette that night. Habit. Momentum.

“No deeper than ten,” I said. “You stay where I can see you the whole time. If you chase a fish, I swear to God I’ll cut your fins off.”

He gave me a weak grin. “You love me too much. I’ll be right back.”

He took two or three calm breaths, duck-dived, and slipped under.

I kept my face in the water. I wasn’t going to be the guy staring at the sky when his buddy vanished.

He leveled out around eight meters, just under the sun-speckled canopy, and swam parallel to the edge of the bed. A school of bigger fish—the kind that make people spend too much on spearguns—hung just out from him. White sea bass, probably. Thick bodies, faint stripes.

He didn’t have a gun with him, but instinct is instinct. He angled toward them a bit, curious.

They flared away, then re-formed, moving just ahead of him. He followed for a few kicks, still in that upper band.

I was about to tap on the float and signal him back when the entire school snapped upward in a tight, silver column.

Something pale shot through the space they’d been in.

For a second it looked like someone had fired a thick cable along the bottom of the kelp. It was that fast. One moment there was nothing, the next there was a length of pale body curling around Tom’s legs.

He didn’t even have time to react.

The creature—whatever it was—looped around him again, higher. A coil across his thighs. Another around his chest. The ridged sides folded and tightened in one fluid motion.

His body snapped rigid. His fins kicked once, purely reflex. A stream of bubbles blasted out from his mask and hood.

He didn’t have a regulator in his mouth to lose. That was the only difference between this and a tank diver’s nightmare.

I didn’t think about it. There wasn’t time.

I spat my snorkel, took the biggest breath I could in a single panicked inhale, and went down.

The water closed over me fast. The taste of rubber from my mouthpiece, salt, and adrenaline was all I had for a second.

I narrowed everything to three points: the float line under my hand, the dark shape of Tom wrapped in pale coils, and the pressure in my chest.

He was at maybe nine meters. Not deep, but with something around his chest and neck and no air, every second counted double.

The creature’s body was thicker than it had looked from above. Up close, it was about as big around as my torso. The skin was a dull, clam-shell white, with a faint, irregular pattern under it like veins or fibers. Along its sides, those ridges I’d felt earlier flexed and moved in small waves.

Tom’s face behind his mask was red, eyes wide and unfocused, mouth strained against the strap. One coil ran diagonally across his jaw and temple. I could see the skin under it already flushing where the ridges dug in.

I grabbed that coil with one hand.

It felt wrong. Not like fish, not like shark. There was give to it, but not the right kind. The ridges pressed into my glove like sucker-less suction cups, tasting the neoprene.

The pressure around my wrist increased. The ridges tightened. For a heartbeat, I had the very clear sensation of being measured.

I yanked my knife with the other hand and drove it down across the band.

The blade bit. There was resistance, then a sudden give. Dark fluid—almost black in the green water—puffed out into the space between us.

The coil spasmed. The whole length of the thing flexed. The water around us shook.

Kelp around us snapped upright and back. Leaves slapped against my mask and hood. A stalk somewhere near my fin cracked like a broom handle breaking.

The band across Tom’s chest loosened half an inch. He surged in it, trying to use the slack. Another coil shifted up, around his shoulders, tightening there instead.

He was out of air. You can tell, even without words. The panic in his eyes shifted from “this hurts” to something more primal. His movements got jerky and uncoordinated.

My own lungs burned. I’d taken a crap breath and then spent it fighting. CO₂ alarms went off all through my body, loud and insistent.

I went for another coil, lower this time, where it held his legs and the float line.

The knife sank maybe halfway before it hit something tougher. I leaned on it, feeling the blade grind against cartilage or bone or something else solid.

The creature’s body twisted. A section near what I think was its far end flared wider. The ridges there flattened, revealing a darker patch that opened and closed once.

I didn’t see teeth. I saw the shape—the roundness, the flex—and the way it angled toward me.

A sound rolled through me. Not something I heard in my ears. A vibration. Low, steady, like a big diesel engine idling against my ribs.

Every instinct I had screamed RUN in a language older than actual words.

My chest cramped. My throat spasmed. My body tried to force an inhale.

If I took a breath, I’d die down there with him. That fact cut through everything.

I let go of the knife.

I grabbed Tom’s shoulders instead and kicked upward, hard, using the line as much as my legs.

The coil around his legs held. The one around his chest tightened again as the creature reacted to our movement, trying to maintain its grip.

For one awful second, we didn’t go anywhere. It was like pulling against a solid post.

Then something gave. Not the creature. Tom.

His hood slipped.

The friction of the coil across his jaw ripped his mask strap free. The mask spun away, bumping my shoulder. His face, suddenly bare to the water, looked wrong—eyes bloodshot, lips pale, bits of dark fluid in the corners of his mouth from where the ridges had scraped his cheek.

He convulsed once more.

His hand, which had been clawing at the coil, dropped.

I’ve practiced rescuing unconscious divers in controlled pools, in class, with instructors watching and safety divers on hand. You learn the feel of dead weight. It’s a specific thing, limp and heavy.

I felt that snap into him like a switch.

The vibration in the water grew stronger. The ridged side of the creature brushed my thigh as it repositioned, and the line of the float slid along its body.

My lungs went from “this hurts” to “we are done.”

Instinct beat training. For me, anyway.

I let go.

I wish I could say I didn’t. I wish I could say I held on until my vision went black and we both woke up on the surface being resuscitated by heroic strangers.

I didn’t.

I pushed off his shoulder instead, aimed for the lighter water, and kicked like I’ve never kicked before.

The kelp blurred. The empty band, the busy band, all of it went past too fast to register. My ears screamed from the ascent rate. I felt something tug at my fin once, then slip.

I cleared the surface in a mess of spray and foam, half-choked on my own reflex inhale.

The sky was too bright. The boat was still there. The float bobbed a couple of meters from me, rope trailing limp.

Tom didn’t surface.

“Where is he?” someone yelled from the boat. It took me a second to realize it was the captain.

I couldn’t answer at first. I was coughing, water and snot and a little bit of bile burning my throat.

“Diver under!” I finally managed, waving one arm. “He’s—he’s under—”

The captain hit an air horn three times and started yelling for the other divers to get out of the water. Someone on deck threw a life ring without thinking. It splashed near me and drifted away.

I sucked air, pulled my mask up on my forehead, and rolled to look down.

The kelp obscured everything. Stalks, blades, shafts of light. The nothing-band. No Tom. No pale coils.

The float line hung free, end swaying.

For a second I thought I saw the long pale shape again, deeper in, moving parallel to the edge of the bed.

Then the boat shadow slid over us and my visibility dropped.

The Coast Guard was called. The captain had to. We were still on the clock.

I remember being hauled up the ladder, my suit dripping, my knees shaking hard enough that I had to sit on the deck. Someone wrapped a towel around my shoulders and kept saying “breathe” like I’d forgotten how.

They made me lie down anyway and put oxygen on me because that’s what you do when someone comes up panicked and fast. A crewman kept asking me how deep I’d been, how long I thought I’d stayed, if I’d blacked out.

“I didn’t black out,” I said, over and over. “I left him. I left him down there.”

They chalked that up to shock.

The other divers—tank guys who’d been doing an entirely different site on the same boat—stood around in various states of half-suited and stunned. The captain paced. He wouldn’t look at the water.

The Coast Guard boat arrived, then another official boat with sonar. They dropped a marker buoy near where we said we’d last seen Tom. They tried to put a team down, but by then surge had picked up and the kelp had shifted. Visibility dropped below anything they considered safe.

They searched until light went. They searched the next day with ROV cameras and more sonar. They found bits of kelp, rocky ledges, one of Tom’s fins. Not the one I’d felt tug. That one was just… gone.

They didn’t find him.

My statement that afternoon in the harbor office was a mess. I sat in a metal chair in my half-peeled wetsuit, shivering under sweats and a loaner jacket, and told them what I remembered.

The officer—a guy in a polo with a clipboard and tired eyes—wrote “entanglement” and “possible hypoxia” and “buddy attempted rescue” on his form. He circled “no tank,” underlined it twice.

He asked me three times if Tom had been chasing a fish.

“Yes,” I finally said. “Kind of. He followed a school. He was still shallow. Something grabbed him.”

“Something?” he repeated, pen hovering. “Like kelp?”

“Like… like an animal.”

He paused. “What kind of animal?”

I could have said “sea lion.” I could have said “shark.” Those would’ve slotted neatly into his paperwork.

“I don’t know,” I said. “Long. Pale. No fins I could see. Coiled around him. Ridges along the side. It… squeezed.”

He looked at me for a long second. His expression didn’t change, but I could feel the quiet click of him moving my account from “useful” to “compromised.”

“We don’t have anything like that in the local species database,” he said finally. “Sounds like you might’ve been disoriented. It happens when you’re on breath-hold and working hard.”

“I know what disorientation feels like,” I snapped. “I did your stupid class. This wasn’t that.”

He wrote “reported ‘unknown animal’” on his form without comment.

Tom’s GoPro was still on his head when the coil wrapped around his face. I saw it. I remember my fingers brushing the mount when the mask slipped.

They didn’t find that either.

The story the news ran the next day was the one you’d expect.

LOCAL FREEDIVER MISSING OFF MORRO BAY, the headline said under a photo of Tom from his own social feed, mask on his forehead, grin wide. Subhead about “danger of breath-hold diving without proper safety protocols.”

They called me his “instructor-trained buddy” and said I “attempted rescue but was forced to surface.” They quoted the Coast Guard about shallow water blackout, about how quickly a diver can lose consciousness at depth.

No one printed the part where I said something had wrapped around him.

The captain didn’t go back to that bed for the rest of the season. I know because I kept checking his charter calendar and asking around. He’d anchor at other spots, talk up other reefs. If anyone asked about the kelp forest, he’d say conditions weren’t good that week.

When people in the freediving group chats brought the incident up, they framed it like the article had. “Blackout.” “Overconfidence.” “Probably got hung up and couldn’t clear his snorkel.” The usual cautionary-story phrases.

I didn’t correct them. It would’ve turned into a fight I didn’t have the energy for.

One guy messaged me privately—another local diver I barely knew in person.

“Hey man,” he wrote. “I was out at [different kelp bed] last month. Not same site, but same coast. Not sure if it helps, but… I saw that thing you wrote about the fish line. Where everything stops. We had that too. No fish below maybe 18m. My buddy thought it was temp. Didn’t feel like that.”

I asked him if anything touched his line, if anyone didn’t come back up.

He said no. They bailed when it felt off. “Gut didn’t like it,” he wrote. “Figured we’d save the PR for a day I’m less attached to.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Every time the fridge compressor kicked in, that low hum made me sit up and stare into the dark, listening for the sound of something sliding along the outside wall.

After a week of that, I unplugged the fridge one night just to prove to myself the sound wasn’t in the house.

It wasn’t. I still heard it anyway, low in my chest, like an afterimage.

There’s not really a neat lesson here.

I could say “don’t freedive alone” or “always stay on the line” or “respect your depth limits.” All of that is true and you should do it.

But we were together. We had a line. We stayed within our training, on paper. We did everything you’re supposed to put in a brochure.

Something out there still found us.

If you dive kelp, pay attention to what the life around you is doing. Fish know more than you do. If every bait school and bass stops at the same depth for no obvious reason, ask yourself why.

If your float line gets pulled from below hard enough to dunk the buoy, and the captain swears the anchor is up, don’t tell yourself it’s just surge.

And if your buddy takes the slate and writes I DON’T LIKE THIS / WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BOAT?

Listen to him. Even if you think the viz is too good to waste.

Sometimes the thing you’re worried about isn’t hypoxia or entanglement.

Sometimes it’s something that already learned where you have to breathe and is just waiting at the edge of that, quiet, testing how hard it has to pull to see what you’ll do.",4,1762912106.0,nosleep,0,0.83,False

1ous8yv,https://v.redd.it/wv1pn88hdq0g1,My wish list to improve game experience (video of my base included for effect),"This was my first playthrough, solo, ps5.  I made a list of things I would change if I could control the universe.  Feel free to disagree or correct any mistakes -- I completely respect that.

1) Add an option for snap point when placing items like furniture for perfect alignment.

2) Move furniture around without reconstructing. IRL, I can scoot my desk over a few inches without having to disassemble it.  Similarly, pick up placed items like food and cooking pots.

3) I would like to craft and place my own coffee machine.

4) The hexwood bucket should hold double the volume as the other buckets laying around the facility.  Otherwise, why craft one?

5) The aquariums should snap vertically and become one tank.  Subnautica has this feature.

6) A cloaking for electrical cords (to hide the wires).  No Man's Sky had this feature.

7) I would like to delete items from the room where I am building a base, to have more control over the space.  7D2D has this feature.

8) When placing an item in a storage slot, I would also like the option to ""assign"" that item to that slot, so the distribution pad will place the item there from my backpack even when none of that item is in that inventory slot.  Does that make sense?  Im not sure I worded that well.

9) I would like an option to sort items in crate by type, and not just by alphabet.  Ark Ascended has this feature.

10) I would like a second alternative recipe for specific items like large plug strips, medium/large shelves, medium/large storage crates.  The alternative recipe would include the small plug, small shelves, small storage crate respectively.  It could also be an ""enhancement"".  The idea is that I could use the small plug to make the larger plug, etc.  That way I dont end up with small plugs, shelves, crates that I worked hard to grind for, but now not use/take up space/may have to delete.  I also appreciate that the game already does this with some weapons and armor.

11) I would like to be able to edit the list of craftable items.  Certain items, like the primitive weapons, are just not going to be crafted again once I get the recipes for the stronger weapons, but they still remain in the list as clutter.  I would like to move them to another list that I could still access and craft from if I *really wanted to*.

12) Certain animations are the same in several games.  Climbing a ladder with both hands on a firearm.  Slapping a bandaid on your wrist when your foot was blown off.  I would change this.  

13) I like that the enhancement bench takes items from storage.  I would like the option to have that feature for the crafting bench.

14) The best recipes weren't unlocked for me until the very end.  I would have liked them earlier.

I appreciate that some inconveniences are just the game mechanic, like no warning on layek essence running low in the containment, or planters drying up.  I am hoping that a dev finds this list and is inspired by at least one of my ideas.  If not, that's fine.  This was the best adventure Ive had in a long time.

1ous8go,https://i.redd.it/vwwqsq31eq0g1.jpeg,What should this room become? Sitting room or formal dining room?,"Hi! I have this amazing room in my home that I can’t commit on its purpose. I have an open floor plan. It’s directly across from my kitchen, and on the other side of my bench which houses my breakfast nook. I ordered 4 chairs with the idea of turning this into a sitting room. A place to have coffee, cocktails when people are in the kitchen, etc. But now I am torn as this room was intended (I believe) to be a formal dining room, and I feel like I should do that. 

Here is my question. We have only one eating space in my house, which is just out of frame in this photo. It’s a bench with a massive wood table and 3 chairs on the other side. It’s PERFECT for my toddler. Not great if we host more than 2 couples. 

How often do you use a formal dining room? Is it a necessity in a home? Will i regret not having one? 

My other hang up is right outside this window is a big outdoor dining table + chairs. So I would essentially have 3 dining spaces all within visibility of each other. Seems overkill. ",1,1762911849.0,interiordecorating,4,0.67,False

1ous03x,https://i.redd.it/vdwc43eybq0g1.jpeg,Short Narrative: Love Trials,"***Love Trials by Muze Artists***

I never liked taking celebrity divorces — too much makeup, too many lies, and far too many publicists pretending to understand pain. But the firm insisted. “Ava, this case will raise your profile,” my boss said. “She’s the most sympathetic wife in the tabloids.”

Sympathetic wasn’t the word I’d use when I first met **Lila Crane**, curled up on my office couch in a designer trench coat, clutching a half-empty coffee like it could testify for her.

“My husband is a good man,” she began. “Or he used to be.”

That line again — I’d heard it a hundred times, always followed by the same revelation: betrayal, neglect, humiliation. I took notes. I nodded. My face was calm, my voice steady, the way clients needed it to be. That’s how I earned their trust. Or rather — their dependency.

“Ava, he hasn’t touched me in three years,” she said. “But there were other women. His trainer, his co-star, his assistant—” she gave a bitter laugh. “Hell, probably his agent too.”

“And you?” I asked, tone flat, purely procedural.

She looked away. “Yes. Once. It wasn’t serious. I just needed to feel…alive.”

I kept writing, though her eyes on me burned like judgment. “Honesty is protection,” I said. “If we hide this, it’ll destroy you later.”

She nodded, then asked quietly, “Do you ever feel like you’re fighting someone else’s marriage to make up for your own past?”

I almost smiled. “You’re paying me by the hour, not for therapy.”

But that night, her words stayed. They always do.

 

Her husband’s lawyer turned out to be **Ethan Ward**. I’d known him for years — we’d clashed across mahogany tables and mediation rooms, trading sharp words like fencing blades. He was too idealistic for divorce law, which I considered both a weakness and an allure. He fought for peace; I fought to win.

When we first locked eyes across the table, that quiet smirk of his said, *Here we go again.*

The meeting was brutal. Lila demanded the house, the custody, the silence clause. Ethan’s client wanted dignity — a word that never survives discovery.

I tore through arguments with surgical precision, citing precedent, precedent, precedent — the rhythm of battle. But then Ethan said something unexpected:

“Maybe if they actually spoke to each other instead of through us, they wouldn’t be at war.”

I leaned back. “You sound like a marriage counsellor, not a lawyer.”

He looked right at me. “Maybe that’s what people need before they call us.”

I didn’t answer. He’d hit a nerve I didn’t know was still alive.

 

Two weeks later, I found myself awake at 3 A.M., re-reading depositions that didn’t change anything. That’s when I remembered my mother’s face — pale, exhausted, sitting on the edge of our old sofa, clutching letters from the court she couldn’t afford to answer. I’d been thirteen. My father had filed for custody, claiming she was “unstable.” His lawyer had coached him well — every tear she shed in court became evidence against her.

I remember watching him walk away with my brothers.  
I remember swearing I’d never be powerless again.

And that’s how I became the woman I am now. Cold. Controlled. Capable.

 

When the tabloids leaked Lila’s affair, everything turned. Ethan’s client wanted blood, and he had the perfect weapon: proof. If that went to court, she’d lose everything. Her children. Her reputation. Maybe her soul.

“Let him use it,” I told her during one late-night meeting, my tone clipped. “We’ll counter with financial leverage.”

She shook her head. “No, Ava. I can’t let my kids read about that in ten years.”

“You think he won’t use it?”

“I think maybe he doesn’t want to,” she whispered. “He’s tired too.”

The words hung there. And I knew she was right. Ethan wouldn’t push this. Not if he thought there was another way.

I picked up the phone and called him. “We need to talk. Off record.”

We met in the dim bar across from the courthouse. He looked tired, his tie loose, his idealism slightly frayed.

“You’re not the type to make peace,” he said.

“Don’t flatter yourself,” I replied. “This is about damage control.”

But after the second drink, honesty slipped in like a draft. “I know what it’s like,” I said quietly. “To watch someone walk away with everything that mattered. My mother lived it. I promised myself I’d never let it happen to another woman.”

Ethan stared at me — not judging, not pitying, just listening. It was disarming.

“You fight hard,” he said finally. “But maybe you’re fighting ghosts.”

“Maybe,” I said. “But I fight to win.”

 

The next morning, in court, I did something reckless. I presented an addendum to the settlement — one that protected Lila’s custody rights and child support in exchange for dropping claims on assets she didn’t need. It wasn’t what the firm wanted. It wasn’t even what my client had asked for. But it was what she needed to survive with her dignity. When the judge signed the settlement, it wasn’t the money that mattered — it was the line Ava had added quietly, almost defiantly: *joint custody with secured child support, no contest.*

Lila looked at me, eyes shining with a mix of gratitude and disbelief that she won. Ethan met my gaze too, his expression somewhere between admiration and worry.

Afterwards, my boss called me in, furious. “You went rogue, Ava. You cost us millions in fees.”

“I saved a family,” I said simply.

“You’re not a social worker.”

“No,” I said, “just a lawyer who remembers what it’s like to lose everything.”

I left the office before he could fire me.

 

That night, Ethan found me sitting on the courthouse steps, heels in my hand, tie loosened around his neck.

“So,” he said, “are you disbarred yet?”

“Give it time.”

He sat beside me, quiet for a while. Then: “You did the right thing.”

I smiled faintly. “You think so because it fits your moral code. Mine’s messier.”

“Maybe that’s why I like you,” he said.

I looked at him, half-laughing, half-wary. “Careful, counsellor. You’re fraternizing with the enemy.”

“Maybe it’s time we switched sides.”

We sat there, silence between us — not the cold silence of clients who’ve given up, but the fragile kind that asks for permission to begin again.

For the first time in years, I didn’t feel like I was fighting. I just felt seen.

 

***Epilogue***

Months later, I started my own small practice — fewer clients, more humanity. Lila sends photos sometimes: her kids smiling, her new apartment, peace.

Ethan and I still argue, of course — about law, about people, about what love even means. But sometimes, in quieter moments, when he’s reading case files beside me, I realize something:

Love doesn’t win in court. It survives in the spaces where we stop fighting.

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. Not looking for a relationship ",1,1762911200.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1ourz9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1ourz9z/is_the_debian_way_dead/,Is the 'Debian way' dead?,"I feel that people were more in love with the ideals of Linux and continue to drink the kool aid rather than wake up and smell the coffee...

Linux has become a playground for big tech for a long time now. So called 'Open source' is just a public friendly cliche for big tech collusion a world apart from what the likes of Stallman intended it to be. All of the biggest tech companies besides Windows and Apple including the most notorious for privacy violations, anti-competitive practices and extortionate pricing all use Linux.

People still think systems like Debian are a save haven from all this. Sadly I think this isn't the case, and tech tyrants are finding ways to saboage free software movements and data sovereignty in ways which are unknown to most people.

Let's start with systemd. The Systemd way and the Debian way are completely at odds. This just presents nothing but strife in an already divided ecosystem and the result is an operating system where some parts are running ""The Debian Way"" while other parts are not. Debian GNU/Linux has incorporated systemd yet at the same time the default networking part is Debian specific. Sometimes you have to disable and remove Debian specific things to get systemd specific things to work. All of this is the result of a system that has been put together by many mismatching components from many different projects.

Even Bruce Perens expressed his opinion loud and clear about systemd in the [past too](https://techrights.org/o/2019/12/02/the-thoughts-of-bruce-perens-on-systemd/). But it happened regardless, even though most were against it... How can any decision be made when a community is so divided as opposed to say FreeBSD which is about as cohesive and efficient as it gets to making decisions? Is this an indication that big tech calls the shots now and want things to work in their favour...?

Let's not forget systemd was created by red hat, which is now owned by IBM, a  leader in intelligence platforms and software. IBM is certainly no stranger to the Intelligence Community and their relationship goes back [decades](https://aussiestorageblog.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/in-1957-the-cia-asked-ibm-to-invent-google-images-and-ibm-said-yes/), through to more recent times such as their aim to achieve a contract with the DoD. Some books have been written about the relationship between the longstanding relationship between IBM and the CIA such as 'Deep Blue: Industrial Espionage, IBM and the CIA' and 'The mysteirous affair at Olvetti', apparently so deep was their involvement that IBM was once considered an arm of the American government.

Fast forward to 2015 during which Systemd become the default init system, a whistleblower exposed how the CIA or bad actors could easily exploit build processes this was just months before Murdock died under 'unclear circumstances'.

The reason why IBM purchased Red Hat is unclear but it appears that any agenda behind systemd may now be showing it's true nature - [must watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRV7xk1qqWA)!

The final nail in the coffin for it all is the way Debian is so unapologetically embracing Rust in it's Toolchain and Base system.

I find myself uneasy, not with the language, but with the momentum, to embrace a project headed by yet another 'collaboration' between tech giants including many Linux powerhouses, once again promising the people greater freedom but with track record that suggest anything but. I get the feeling that yet again we’re folding more and more into the same few projects, until individuality and composability blur into a single stack.

The rational for unifying service management, making configuration consistent across distributions over time just always ends up growing beyond its first purpose - quietly absorbing pieces of the OS until it became less a component and more an environment of its own. And it looks like the same thing is happening once again with Rust -  like déjà vu; living through the same forceful, unwilling and unnessecary shift to systemd all over again. I can't help but feel this is all just 'by accident' or a coincidence every time.

It might be time to move to a system like FreeBSD that unlike linux, hasn't been completely hijacked by the agenda of tech elitsists, that use tried and tested technology like C and works as a 'real' system because at this point, Linux beyond it's empty hype, is just another, like windows, but perhaps even worse, as it's one that creates the illusion of freedom and choice.

I live here in Orange, CA, and over the last few months I’ve been chatting with café and shop owners while grabbing coffee or lunch. One thing I keep noticing — a lot of amazing local places either don’t have a website at all or just rely on Google Maps and Instagram.

It made me curious, so I wanted to ask here —
for anyone running or helping with a small business:
👉 What stopped you from setting up a website or running digital ads?
Is it cost, time, or just not feeling like it’s worth it anymore in the age of social media?

From my side, I work with GMA Technology, where we help small businesses build simple, mobile-friendly websites and run local digital-marketing campaigns.
Nothing fancy or corporate — just clean sites that actually help you get found on Google and bring more people in the door.

If you’re curious or want to see how a one-page site could look for your café, salon, or store, feel free to DM me — happy to share ideas or examples.
Not a sales pitch — just trying to connect with more local owners and learn what works for you.

1ourwm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/meetnyc/comments/1ourwm4/quiet_company_for_people_carrying_heavy_things/,Quiet Company - for people carrying heavy things (NYC based),"Sometimes therapy or advice isn’t what we need most... sometimes we just need to sit with people who get it.

Quiet Company is a low-pressure social space for anyone living with deep stress, loss, or trauma who wants connection without having to explain or fix anything. We don’t focus on the heavy stuff, we know it’s there. Instead, we grab coffee, talk about books, walk, play games, do yoga, or just hang out.

Far too often, people going through deeply traumatic situations start to drift away from others because no one truly understands what they’re carrying. When they talk or even beg for help, people can miss the severity of what’s happening.

But here, every person you meet is also carrying weight on their shoulders. We’re not here to talk about what that weight is, but only to share the quiet comfort of knowing that when we sit across from one another, we both feel that same presence on our shoulders. Maybe, without saying a word, we finally feel understood.

The only real “requirement” is gentleness: everyone here is doing their best under something heavy. No trauma-dumping, no comparisons, no advice unless asked, just real people sharing small, calm moments together. If that sounds like something you’ve been missing, comment or message me. 

(This isn’t therapy or a crisis group, if you ever feel unsafe or in danger, please reach out for professional help or call/text 988 in the U.S., or use local crisis services.)",3,1762910951.0,meetnyc,0,1.0,False

1ourvs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ourvs9/starbucks_you_preach_inclusion_but_your_system/,"Starbucks, you preach inclusion, but your system screens out amazing autistic talent","Hey everyone, I need to vent about something that needs to change at our core.

Why is the unemployment rate for autistic adults so ridiculously high (like 85%)? It's not because we can't make a decent latte. It's because the standard interview process is straight-up RIGGED against us.

Starbucks constantly claims staffing shortages, but the corporate system actively rejects the most meticulous, detail-oriented talent we have. The company preaches ""inclusion"" while practicing ""neurotypical screening.""

The Interview: Performance Art, Not Skill Assessment
Look, the job of a barista is precision work: memorizing drink codes, adhering to health protocols, and maintaining complex routines. Autistic people are often perfect for this kind of focus.

But all of that skill is irrelevant because the first hurdle is a ridiculous social game designed to trip us up:
• The Forced Enthusiasm Tax: We are expected to be ""on"" instantly, performing forced eye contact and generating high-energy warmth. If I struggle with that—if I’m quiet, focused, or just honest—I’m instantly flagged as ""unfriendly"" or ""lacking the Third Place vibe."" That's prejudice, not professionalism.

• The Vague Question Hell: Why do you ask ""Tell me about a time you handled conflict""? I'm looking for a script! Give me a direct question about procedures! Having to interpret ambiguous social scenarios on the spot is exhausting, and when my answer isn't the ""smooth story"" you expected, I'm seen as unable to communicate.

Here's the thing: When a manager dismisses a candidate as ""not a good cultural fit,"" what they are really doing is hiding the fact that they are screening for social conformity, not job competence. It is a fact that, it’s discrimination and a form of ableism.


Stop Making Excuses, Start Making Adjustments
We are qualified. We just need Starbucks to stop making excuses and start adopting hiring practices that actually test our ability to do the job:
• Ditch the Vague Interview. Replace it with a Paid Work Trial or a Task-Based Assessment (e.g., test my ability to restock quickly, batch-prep orders, or follow a complex, written recipe). That is the true measure of a good barista.

• Stop the traditional interview. Conducting the interview in person is one way to screen out qualified applicants whether intentionally or unintentionally, it’s better for hiring managers to not know the demographic information of applicants, not even the names until the applicant gets hired to avoid bias. Instead, applicants get provided a unique application ID number which the hiring team may see.


Starbucks Needs to Stop Pretending and Truly Change How It Hires

You can't claim to value diversity while relying on a hiring process that specifically targets and eliminates the neurodivergent community. If Starbucks wants the best, most dedicated partners, they need to stop prioritizing acting skills and start testing actual job skills with modern solutions:
• Ditch the Traditional Interview! The face-to-face performance ritual must go. Replace the initial screening entirely with online, skill-based assessments when the application is first submitted. This tests essential functions like following multi-step written instructions, checking for recipe deviations, and problem-solving scenarios—the exact skills needed behind the bar.

• Implement Truly Anonymous Hiring (Blind Screening): Applicants can, of course, enter their name and demographic information, but that data must be entirely anonymous to the hiring team. The hiring manager should only see the candidate's verified job history, availability, and the scores from the online assessment, all linked to a simple, unique Application ID. This removes bias related to name, race, assumed gender, age, and appearance right from the start.

We are qualified. We are meticulous. We thrive on routine. We deserve the chance to be judged on our ability to serve coffee, not on our ability to flawlessly perform the neurotypical social script.

We deserve to be judged on our ability to serve coffee—not on our ability to perform the neurotypical social script flawlessly. This crisis is on the system, not on the talent. Our communication style is not the problem, it’s the employer and the hiring management’s bias.

Any other ideas getting these stubborn stains out? When I used the Folex or the hoover cleaner they disappeared and then when it dries it magically comes back.

The stains are Starbucks cold brew coffee from the store if that helps.

Hi there! I’m a 27-year-old cute and slim transwoman, living in the world of fashion and photography. I love good light, good coffee, and conversations that go deeper than small talk. Curious, stylish, and a little playful—I enjoy exploring new places and new ideas.

You can check my pics on my profile

I’m 5’6”, normal bmi, and drawn to men who are confident, fit, and masculine, yet kind and witty enough to keep up with my sass. Bonus if you’ve got that “I’ve-got-this” energy and a warm smile.

If you reach out, share your ASL, a quick intro, and something unique about you. Let’s see where creative meets masculine—maybe over coffee, maybe more. 🌙✨

\- you don't go to the meet with a M for Mavs hoodie to psychologically trick Nico into thinking you're on his side in this choice..   
\- you stop the talks involving Luka even before the coffee arrives, and call the closest mental healthcare center in town   
\- you pay at least for the coffee and pastries  
\- you don't keep the poker face that long  
\- you remember Nico that in less than a year, he will be jobless and with a forever ruined reputation

1ourhmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1ourhmr/my_aim_and_circumstances/,My aim and circumstances.,"I am five foot seven or eight inches. I weigh 78kgs. I want to get lean while developing some muscle, I am aiming for calesthenics but just dont have the time for it.

I have 30 to 40 minutes daily, sometimes more but can't go gym. I need help for where to go from where I am. 

I was 84kg, I started pushups, plank and sit ups, and now can do fifteen pushups without much effort, and failure around 23, 24. Plank I can do for sixty seconds. I do daialy about 4 sets of fifteen pushups, my diet is vegetarian, so I have a liter of buffalo milk in the morning and one liter in the night. I have, besides that a liter of water just after waking up, and another two liters throughout the day.  (morning milk with some coffee, evening milk with some whey, not a full scoop but just a spoonfull). besides this in the afternoon I try to have something healthy, replacing my junk cravings with diet coke, and fruits.

What simple exercises can I add to my routine, and what else should I do.",1,1762909817.0,workout,2,1.0,False

1ourgnw,https://i.redd.it/6lbwbbpr7q0g1.jpeg,"“I spend over three thousand dollars a year here, which I just found out today…” (S10E20)","In “Farewell, Nervosa”, Frasier quotes the above figure to café owner Maureen Nervosa (sitcom icon Amy Hill), as justification for his request that she fire Ben the folk singer (living legend Elvis Costello.)

Naturally this got me wondering just how much that would be today, 22 years later, and in looking it up a few different places, that comes to around $5,300. 

Now, he probably doesn’t go there literally every day- he has days off, he goes on trips we don’t see, etc.- but let’s assume just for the sake of the thought experiment that Frasier goes to Nervosa *on average* at least once per day over the course of a year. 

$5,300 divided by 365 comes to $14.52 per day. A grande latte at the nearest Starbucks to me right now would run you $6.15. You’d have to get that grande latte, plus a pastry and a bottle of water to hit $14.52, the amount Frasier spends there daily. 

So what the *hell* is he ordering?!

Also: we know for a fact that Frasier has at least one coffee maker at home- Martin mentions a brand-new imported espresso machine in this very episode- and that he is very particular about his morning coffee and breakfast routine. 

So, sub-question: how much coffee is he drinking every day?!",111,1762909742.0,Frasier,23,0.98,False
