1fw2v3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/realityshifting/comments/1fw2v3i/talking_about_my_dr_parties_magic_which_teachers/,"talking about my dr (parties, magic, which teachers show favoritism + more) ","this turned into me answering every question i've gotten in dms so i hope it's coherent. 

disclaimer: my dr is *my dr*, it follows canon to a certain extent, but there are many, many parts that don't. everyone in my year is 20+. now let's discuss 

**are there parties? which house has the best parties?**

.... strictly speaking, *no.* listen, i've seen the youtube videos, and based on those, definitely slytherin parties. but at least in my house, no, it's nothing like that. there are no house-wide parties, simply because snape would shut it down faster than we could even start it. 

i've never actually seen him in the student spaces, but he knows everything. it just would never work. even if somehow we found a way to hide it from him, it wouldn't be house-wide, because the underclassmen definitely wouldn't be invited. 

first years in my dr are sixteen. no one wants to hang out with 16-18 year olds. 

BUT, if you know the right people, there are still ""get-togethers"". it's usually the older quidditch boys, and they are *annoying*, but you have to get in their good graces if you ever want to be invited to anything. it's also not a whole bunch of people, and there's no music or food. would you call that a party? 

there's just *illicit substances* and like 10 people at most. in my opinion, it's not worth putting up with the guys who throw them, but if your friends are going, then you kind of have to. 

as for other houses, i've been invited to a few similar ""get-togethers"" in hufflepuff, which i'm guessing have even more illicit substances. again, not house-wide, it's usually just a few people in someone's dorm. 

i know for sure that gryffindor has parties after a quidditch win, but that's because mcgonagall is lenient about it when she's in a good mood. snape doesn't care about quidditch if we're going to make a mess, so even the victory parties are in someone's dorm, and hushed up. 

i can't imagine ravenclaws having anything close to a party, but i don't know anyone from there so I have no idea. 

**what does it feel like to cast magic?**

i can rant about this all day so i'm going to try to keep it concise. 

casting magic is the most natural thing in the world. it's so natural, you don't have to think about it. it's literally effortless.   
  
we get told this all the time, but magic *wants to be used.* it's energy. it wants to be in the most chaotic state possible. that's why when you get angry, excited, or feel any strong emotion, the magic will just burst out. 

hogwarts doesn't teach you how to use magic, because you are born knowing that. it teaches you how to *control* magic, which believe it or not, takes a lot more effort. having restraint is way harder than letting go, because magic is raw power. 

that's why we have wands, because they put a ""leash"" on the magic. if you have something to conduct magic through, it makes it so *you* can use magic the way you want. without a wand, the magic uses you as a conduct.  

but there are downsides to using a wand, and it's that it puts up a sort of subconscious block which is hard to get rid of later. only in dangerous situations you gain that reflex back from before you started using one. 

i may have gotten slightly off topic, but i love talking about the theory of this. 

**laundry/ hygienic items?**

i've seen this described differently by other shifters, but in my dr laundry is done every day. i don't know exactly how this works, but i know that elves are in charge of it from canon. 

so, after you take off your dirty clothes, as long as it's part of the uniform, literally anywhere you put them, they will disappear and be replaced by new ones. yes, this also applies if you take a bath and leave your clothes outside. 

i wish i had a more in depth answer, but you don't have to leave the room, look away, or anything. your clothes will literally vanish and you'll find, usually folded, a replacement for the item that you put down (when it's your uniform). 

if it's your personal clothes, they will still vanish, but they won't appear right away. they'll appear in your closet, sometimes the next day and sometimes within an hour, but they appear either folded or hung up based on what clothing item it is. 

next is hygenic items, toothpaste, deodorant, menstrual products, etc. 

i don't know if it's different for other houses, but in slytherin there is a large storage cupboard just outside the ""main"" bathrooms (the dorms have ensuite bathrooms) and you can find everything in there. it's always stocked, and it has the same spell as the clothing one, which replaces it as soon as you take one. 

**is the food good? is it feast-style everyday? what about for picky eaters?**

if you're concerned about the quality of the food, please don't be. whoever you are, i promise, the food is *heavenly.* 

i also thought i wouldn't enjoy it because a lot of the canon dishes are quintessentially british, but everything about the castle is somehow personalized. 

for example, in my dr, i am from america, just like in this reality. so somehow, i find that the dishes around me are 50/ 50 british and american. there'll be boiled potatoes and stews and all those meat pies (so many pies), next to french fries and chicken nuggets. and they'll be right next to *me.* 

i don't know if it works that way only for me, or if all the other students also have their tastes taken into account, but it is just *perfect.* 

as for the style, for dinner it's usually large platters of food and you serve yourself at the tables. it sounds messy, but you are always within arm's length of every component of the meal.   
  
there are different courses, usually soups and salads first, then they disappear, replaced with meats and carby dishes (pasta, potatoes, rice), and then they disappear, and there's dessert, which is more pies, sometimes cakes on individual little plates (you don't cut it yourself), jellos and puddings, which i'm not too interested in. 

next to me there's usually fruit and porridge, also spreads, like peanut butter and even almond butter once. 

for breakfast, it's mostly the same. the ""main"" parts of the meal are in large platters all around the table, and you serve yourself. so it'll be toast, sausages, eggs, etc. 

but then at the front, right in front of where the teachers sit, there are also little stations. so you can make your own coffee, tea, etc, and there's a selection of pastries and baked goods, like muffins, bagels, all of the bready stuff. 

there's usually not too many people crowding the stations until it's like 15 minutes to class. 

to close this out, **which professors do i get along with and which do i not?**

this could be it's own post, but i just wanted to say, snape does not show favoritism to the slytherins! if anything, we are held to higher standards and graded more harshly, because he knows us better. 

most heads of house keep an eye on their students' grades and intervene if anything starts dropping. snape doesn't let it get to that. if you miss an assignment in *another teacher's class,* and he finds out about it, you will get detention as if it was his class. 

anyway, i just wanted to clear his name. 

and that's all for today.

1fw2u83,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fw2u83,My Experience travelling to the Vijayanagar Empire ,"
Ever since I learned about the great vijayanagar Empire, I always wanted to visit its capital, Hampi. so, when I had a weekend free, I know, I shouldn't miss this oppurtunity.I booked the hampi express from bangalore. The nearest railway station to hampi was hospete.

The train reached hospete around 7 am. I Moved along the crowd exiting the station cluelessly. Autokars were haggling hard with the tourists. The Most common settled bargain was ₹300 to take you to hampi which is 10 km from hospete.I walked past all these commotion to find something to eat, Thats when a share auto guy was shouting."" Bus stand 20, Bus stand 20"". I thought why Not.
Hopped on the auto after being assured there's a lots of buses to hampi. 

Reached the bus stand,ate a nice masala Dosa and a filter coffee. Then boarded the very crowded hampi Bus, everybody around me were giving their aadhaar card to the conductor. My dumb self thought ""oh maybe it's to do something with the UNESCO site protection"".looking at the backside of my ID, I was turned down rudely telling me the free ticket was only for the karnataka ladies:( I almost laughed loudly at myself. The ticket was ₹18. The bus dropped me in the Virupaksha temple parking. My stay was just a 5 mins walk from there. Reached my stay, got  ready for my solo escapade. I only had 2 days, so I only wanted to cover the south hampi.Packed itinerary stresses me out.

I was told about the ancient Kampa bhupa pathway, built by Kampala,the son of harihara, which starts just east of Virupaksha, runs along the bank of thungabadra, till the vittalapura ( the famous stone chariot). It's a 2.5 km walk and there is a lots of monuments on the way. Armed with my water bottle, umbrella and sunscreen, I started my heritage walk in scorching sun. Surprisingly it was a pleasant walk, the chill breeze from thungabhadra saved me. I saw achyutaraya bazaar, kodanda Ramar temple, sugriva's cave, ancient lamp post, king's balance, and many many boulders on the way. Stopping and gawking at all the monuments and resting in shady stone benches in regular interval, made my 30 min walk, a 2.5 hour walk. I met a group of artist from Nashik, live painting the beauty of the monuments with the backdrop of thungabhadra, time just flies away when you chat with the random travellers. I reached the vittala temple around 12 pm, marvelled at the stone chariot, music pillar, took some amazing pics with the kindness of strangers. I wanted to hire a guide badly, but after many many lessons some my previous trips( Cambodia, Fatehpur sikri,jaipur,etc) I refrained from that idea. They tell you nothing more than you already know from the videos,blogs and books. sometimes give out wrong Infos, scam us into buying something useless, or donation, rush us into finishing the tour as fast as possible.  But the FOMO was high.

By the time, I'm ready to go back to room, I was parched with an empty water bottle, and I knew there is not a single shop on my way back. A guard advised me to take the battery car to the vittala car parking, there are many shop there. A round ticket costs me 20. Quenched my thirst with a bottle of cold water, the queue for the battery vehicle back to the temple was huuuge. Had to wait for what it seemed like eternity, reached the temple finally, started to walk back to my room. On my way back, there was a group getting ready for the coracle ride near the kodanda rama temple. I enquired and found it's ₹500 for 30 mins ride and ₹800 for 1 hour ride. In this 800 ride, you get to visit kotilingam temple. I settled for the ₹ 800 one, but since I was solo, I had to wait till 3 other people book it. I waited for around an hour, no one come. It was 4 pm by then. I was sweaty, hungry and tired. I abandoned the coracle ride and walked to find some restaurant. Had lunch, went to room and took a nap. By 6 pm, I decided to take a stroll, bought a good book about Vijaya Nagar empire, went to a cozy cafe, and spent my evening reading, had pizza for dinner and called it a day.
Next day, I started my day early. I went to matanga hills for sunrise. Then by, 7 am, I walked to hemkunta hills, it had a Ganesha temple, then visited monolithic Narasimha, badavi lingam, pushkarani, an ancient Durga temple built before Vijaya Nagar empire's establishment. I finished all this my 10am, had breakfast in a roadside eatery, went to a cafe, and continued reading my book till the evening. In the evening,  I visited a gallery, monolithic bull,coracle ride and finally Virupaksha temple.  Had a great dharshan, went back to room, packed and caught an auto to hospete railway station. There ends my much anticipated trip.

Sorry for the long post, I want to remember this trip forever:)

1fw2t8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1fw2t8l/whos_responsibility_is_this/,who’s responsibility is this? ,"So my roommate and I prior to moving in we both agreed on what each of us would bring. We did it in a way that each person would be spending equal amounts. I decided to get the couch. The couch I was able to order ended up being smaller than what it looked like on picture. I thought about getting another one but it is okay because we don't really have guest over and both of us usually just stay in the room. It's been about 3 months and my roommate has never said anything about the couch. She texted me this morning and asked if I could buy another one or if we could split the price of a new one. Now I agree that a better quality couch would be better, however the thing is I don't want to spend more money. Not because I'm broke or anything but because she didn't bring the stuff that she promised to bring(which means I ended up spending more money than her) she was suppose to bring a lot of the kitchen supplies like pots and pans. She didn't do it so I eventually just brought them myself because I was sick of not being able to cook stuff. She was also suppose to bring a coffee table and tv stand and she did neither. So I feel like asking me to spend more money or even to split the cost is crazy. I brought what I promised to buy and while the couch isn't exactly what expected I am fine with it. She's the one who has the problem with it so I feel like she should buy the new couch not me especially because she didn't bring the other stuff she promised to bring. Should I chip in with the cost or tell her she will need to buy it herself if she wants a new one so bad. ",1,1728057958.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

1fw2nkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1fw2nkv/2_night_in_manhattan_area_this_fall/,2 Night in Manhattan Area this Fall,"Hi AskNYC,

I’m coming to the city for a concert at Irving Plaza this Fall. Planning to get there Thursday and leave Saturday. Just looking for any feedback/recommendations on what I’ve planned so far.

Travel:
It seems like flying into LaGuardia would be best when considering the cost of travel from the airport to the manhattan area. It looks like shared shuttle services would be cheaper than an Uber. Looking for a recommendation on a shuttle service or just a way to save on travel from airport to hotel and vice versa. 

Lodging:
My hotel budget is 800-1300 for 2 nights and I’ve looked into the Westin and Plaza and then other hotels near the lower end of my budget. My main goal with the hotel is to find a comfortable and clean room while being in a location where I can limit taxi/uber rides so I can mostly walk to get food, visit museums, shop for clothes/gifts.

Food:
This is maybe the toughest part for me because of so many options. I know I have to get pizza, probably near wherever my hotel is if there are any must have spots near where I want to stay.
I’d like to find a nice coffee/bagel shop for breakfast. I enjoy espresso and I’ll probably get a vanilla latte. For bagels I like lox bagels with all the works. But not opposed to a good BEC w/ spk.

I’d like to splurge on a steak dinner one night with a budget of $100-$150 but I’d like to avoid anywhere with a formal dress code. I understand reservations maybe be an issue as well. If not steak, I’m open to a must have experience with sushi or seafood in general. I do like cultural culinary experiences too so Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Italian and Western European work as well. My goal is to avoid leaving Manhattan or having to travel 45+ minutes back and forth from my hotel. 

Things to do:
Aside from the concert, I want to visit a museum. I’m thinking MOMA but open to others.

I plan to walk around Central Park in the morning after I’ve had breakfast. Having a coffee in hand while at the park just seems right.

At night after dinner, I’d like to have a nice drink or 2. Looking for a nice cocktail experience where I can sit and enjoy myself. Not looking for a club. But a good lounge/bar where I can listen to a mix of some 90s/2000s hip hop & RnB, pop hits and or alternative. The place doesn’t have to be the newest or fanciest but I’d like a somewhat relaxed adult atmosphere. I’m cool with large crowds too but would prefer somewhere I can grab a seat and not be shoulder to shoulder. 

My time in NYC is limited and I’m trying to make the most of it while also not spending too much time in car rides from place to place. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to provide their input. I’ve tried to provide as much detail as I can so you don’t feel like you’re planning my trip for me. Thank you AskNYC",1,1728057577.0,AskNYC,0,1.0,False

When I was 19, the acceptance test for Mechanical Engineer (chatter: you will have a safe job, they are always wanted) vs the acceptance test for physics, where my heart was (but chatter: you can only work in highschool with this) was one day earlier than physics one. I went, was accepted. Never went for the physics one. This is the biggest mistake of my life, as I love physics, science and astronomy. Ever, 3-4 years I get a depression episode, where I am again pushing down my wishes to ""become a scientist"". I was smart. Now just drained and stupid. Switching during studies did not seem like an option, I would lose all scholarship. Now I would give it all back gladly, I would have slept on the bench just to do it.

Still. Besides going to the local observatory and hnging out with grandpas (which I do enjoy so far) doing photography, is there any ideas, even if they take 5-10 years, I could ever end up working in anything remotely related to that, even if just bringing coffees?

I apologie for the frustration in my posts. I currently only see gray wall in front of my face.

1fw2mtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1fw2mtj/what_to_eat_on_wegovy/,What to eat on wegovy.,"I've lost 30 lbs in 8 months and have plateaued although still 10 pounds from my goal weight and am still high on measures on bmi and body fat. I still respond erratically to the wegovy, sometimes me tired and other times I feel.nauseous. Some times I don't feel like eating at all. Because it's so variable I don't have a regular eating plan. 

I would.like to develop a regular healthy eating plan to.make sure I get enough nutrients and energy because I exercise a lot but sometimes I feel really tired, do t exercise and feel bad about myself.  I think my tiredness may be related to not eating enough if that makes sense.

I usually just have coffee for breakfast, and either skip lunch or try to have something with a lot of.protein like a shake, or bean burrito, or rice and protein for lunch (small.portions) and then a regular dinner with my husband ( often rice, protein, veg) but in a smaller portion. For exercise I do a.half hour stretchi g and low impact exercise 5 days a week and swim about a kilometer 2-3 times a week and go horseback riding 1 x a week. 

I know I have to work on my hydration more. I tried taking AG1 powder supplements to insure I get.more veggies  and my go to snack is fruit but find myself taking 5 hour naps in the afternoon (this.missing my swim workout) and go to bed around 10 pm and wake up at 5:30 am. I often wake up serveral.times a night.  Oh and I'm 62 years old.

Has anyone found a regular healthy meal.plan that helps you continue to lose weight? Sometimes just the thought of eating makes me.nauseous. does this sound familiar?

***^((There will be discussion subjects that might be considered NSFW in this part, but no acts or actions are described. It is more of a moral discussion about NSFW behaviours and acts))*** 

Adam guided Dream out of the hangar as Roks worked the secondary utilities. It became apparent to Jack that it was better to have two than one on the bridge.  Once they had made it out and set the course, they turned to each other. 

“So what now?” Roks said, “I have two books, but I think we should also contact Jork. He might know something about this. It's his people, after all.” 

Adam nodded and looked down the hall. “Okay, keep them busy. I don’t want them to hear us debating this. For now, you don’t do anything. It might be completely normal in their culture.”

Roks got up. “ Yeah, but five and one old? It just feels wrong. I never heard of that in a good way before. But I guess there is a first time for everything.” Then he walked out, and Adam closed the door behind him and turned to the communication; after a few minutes, he got it to work. He really should get somebody to deal with this. He had accidentally scanned the whole system for minerals and got a warning from the hub. 

“Yes sir, what can I help you with?” was at his post as he answered.

“Hi there, I have a weird question.  How many wives are permitted in your culture? We have a passenger with five wives.” Adam didn’t want to small talk as he didn’t know if the line would last after they reached the jump point. He had about ten minutes.

“Five wives? Is it a noble or a priest? Normally, we have enough with one. Nobles can afford more, but those would have their own ships. So priests marry old widows to ensure they are well taken care of.” He replied, a little shocked.

“He seemed like a priest of Gurron. He said something about being blessed with many wives and that they were going to start a family. The wives looked young, "" he said, and Jork saw.

“He is a Gurron worshipper; It’s a cult, so yeah, that is something I would not put past them. They are not very much liked. They claim it's their duty to be bountiful and have many offspring, so they do crazy stuff like this.  Be careful. I don’t want to seem prejudiced, but those guys have been known to be in liege with criminals. The reputation is that they use their wives as prostitutes to help get them pregnant. It's all about having many kids.”   Jork said with a serious voice.  “But I only heard and read about them, never meet any.”



Adam nodded. “So we are talking about a religiose zealots. Okay. Thank you for your help. Did get my instructions by the way?”

“Yes, I'm looking for areas; the students are building a map of potential sea levels we can experience later, so I'm trying to find a safe place. One of them mentioned it might be smart to build an aquatic base already since it is easier to build it while the land is still dry.” He replied.



“Sounds like this seems like a good idea. Find a safe location, and start producing earthquake sensors and deploying them along the fault lines. That way, we can monitor it and keep the students busy. Okay, I’m getting to the jump point now. I will lose contact; if something important happens, call the lawyers. The hub has enough communications arrays to contact us in hyperlanes. Cya in a few weeks.” He hung up and got ready for the jump. It went smoothly, so he went to find the others. He found Roks and Fader Kungo Mytt in the mess hall.

“Where are your wives?” Adam asked as he entered, and Fader Kungo smiled at him. “ They are in the cabin, where they belong. I will bring them food later, "" he replied, and Adam looked at him and then at Roks.

“I'm sorry, but why? Some religious reasons?” Adam said as he got out a bottle of dark fizzy drink and sat down. 

Roks smiled slightly. “He told me he plans to open a Tavern on the colony. He already has friends there waiting for him.”



Fader Kungo nodded. “ You are strangers and I am alone. They would feel safer there. You are not Buginos. No offense but its scary for young woman to see such strange creatures.”

“Oh, they have nothing to fear from us. I'm a second father to one, Miker. He's a beautiful little boy.” Adam replied, and Roks agreed.

Fader Kungo smiled. “Miker? It sounds like you have gained somebody's trust. Who are the parents? And what denomination do they belong to?” He asked as he sipped the coffee that Roks had given him.

“I don’t know which denomination, and the father works for me; unfortunately, the mother has passed. He doesn’t speak too much about his people. I know his late wife was the love of his life, and it broke his heart when she passed.” Adam replied as he studied the man in front of him.

Fader Kungo drank more coffee. “I'm sorry to hear about her passing; he should get more wives and spread the love. If you bring him to the colony, I might be able to help him with that. “He sipped his coffee and smiled. “This is good. I would love to buy more. It seems to give me energy.”

Adam thought about it. He could actually plant beans. He had the seeds, and it would take at least ten years before he could get enough to sell. “I will keep it in mind. But as you see, you don’t need to lock your wives in the cabin. As you know, it will be seven days before we arrive, and the more, the better the company.”

“Yes, company is always better,” Fader Kungo replied. But I'm worried since they are not properly trained yet.” He leaned a little forward. But maybe you could help me train them, for a price, of course .”



Adam looked at him then to Roks, and back to the Fader. “I thought you said they was scared of us?”

“Yes, but they need to get used to it; of course, they will mostly deal with our people, but there are always some with strange urges.” The fader replied. “I'm too old to keep up with five young ones; I might as well earn some money on them as they increase the fold.  Better to be pragmatic about such things. My lord commands me to ensure a big brood.”

“Well, we do not have such urges, but they are free to walk around and get used to strangers.“ Adam said he was desperate to find out if they were okay with what he felt was a horrible fate. He wanted to help if he could, but this might be completely normal for them, poor souls. Roks was tense, and Adam could sense it; everything he said went against his Tufon honor, but he held his tongue. Fader Kugo nodded “I see you won't stop asking, but I will cost you 14 credits, even if it is just looking, but it is for seven days straight.” Adam sent him the money, and Roks was about to jump the fader but restrained himself, and the old man left for the cabins.  The moment he was out of hearing, Roks turned to Adam.

“What's wrong with you? We should toss him out of the airlock. He is about to turn them into whores. And you are paying him!” The words were whispered with a growl, and Adam looked after the Fader, 

“How else can we talk to them and find out if they want this? They might be religious zealots who want this. If we kill him, we are pirates; we need to find a way to rescue them and not be seen as pirates. Having them locked in the cabin will make that harder. We need to separate them from him to get them to talk. If they are held against their will, we will rescue them. “ Adam spoke quickly so they could finish this before they returned.  “Besides, look through the books and see if you can find anything we can use.” 



Roks calmed down a little and took a deep breath. He still wanted to kill the old man but tempered himself. Soon, he returned with the wives, now dressed much more revealing. Looking shyly around. Like Jork they had the spotted grey pattern going down their arms and back, but their skin was of different shades of yellow to green, and they had green to orange hair hanging loosely down or in complicated braids—their four eyes color from blue to bright green. Their clothes were made of layers of silk that barely hid anything. They were as tall as Adam, and for a second, he just looked; it may have been the shock of the complete change from what he had seen at the hub.

“Welcome, ladies, make yourself at home. These are the common areas, and you are all welcome to relax and enjoy food and drink.  There are two alcoves along the wall where you can watch entertainment or listen to music. Please ask before you go to the bridge, engine room, or storage. The rest of the ship you can walk around in.” He said with a smile and they all bowed, as they looked shyly around.

“They only paid for the company, nothing else. If they ask, they have to pay first. Remember that,” Fader Kungo said as he found himself a new cup of coffee without asking and sat down. Adam just smiled and showed them around. It felt like talking to teenage girls, which made him sick to his stomach. Only one of them seemed to be an adult.  After the girls and the fader retired, Roks and Adam sat down on the bridge to discuss it. They both wanted to toss him out of the airlock, and Adam started to think they could not do this trip without killing the fader.

“I hate this, I'm not a killer, but it's testing my limits,” Adam said as he looked out the window, Roks sat at his station scanning the books.

“I have no problem with killing, just give the order and he is dead.” He replied and Adam sighed. 

“What if it's all legal? Then, we are criminals and can be turned into slaves. Everything we have done goes away. If we do it, we need to do it legally.” Adam countered. He didn’t like it, but he also had to think about the others. 

“Well, nothing in the books stops it; any man can marry as many he wants in their laws as long as the woman has come of age. And they have no laws against prostitution. It seems what he is doing is legal, even if it is disgusting.” Roks said as they turned the screen off.

“Woman of age? What does that mean? And can they be forced to?” Adam looked at him, and Roks opened the screen again and quickly searched the question. 

“Coming of age for women is sixteen years old in their culture, and they are sold into marriage and have no rights to deny, though most seem to ignore that part. Remember Jork told us he proposed to Mike’s mum after dating for two years? "" He said as he read the laws.

“Looks like we got the good one back home and met the asshole version here. Okay, we need to talk to them without him being around?” Adam mused.

“Whiskey, we put it in his coffee, and he will fall asleep or get talkative. Remember, Jork can't hold his liquor; he goes to sleep early.”  Roks suggested ands Adam thought about it. 

“Okay. Computer. When Fader Kugo orders coffee, I want you to add a little whiskey, not too much; I don’t want him poisoned. Do not inform him about it, but start monitoring him so we can make sure we are not killing him with the coffee. But don’t let him know.” 



“Affirmative, starting protocol now.” The computer replied, and Roks looked at him. 

“We are looking for a reason to kill him, so why be so careful? Happy accidents happen.” He said, and Adam chuckled.

“Yes, but I’m securing our ass so if anything does happen, we can prove we didn’t intentionally try to kill him.” 

“You are too kind. I'm going to bed,” Roks said and headed out. Adam sat down in the chair and looked out into the vastness of space as it flew by.



The plan worked perfectly. The fader really liked the new coffee even better, and he quickly found himself falling asleep, leaving the girls alone with Adam and Roks. In the beginning, the girls seemed to fear what the men would do to them, but after a few days of Adam letting the youngest, who was only sixteen, watch movies and listen to music while they talked to the two eldest, they calmed down. The oldest was Skee Laf. She was 23 years old. Through her, they find out they are all sisters bought by the father when the family gets into debt with a group of criminals. Skee had been studying at the university and had just finished her Ocean biology master's and returned to the family farm when the family had threatened to kill their parents and older brother if they didn’t pay. Apparently, the parents had lent money to send her to the university. Then Fader Kugo suddenly showed up with money and told them he would pay the debt and give them some extra for the right to marry all the sisters.  Her brother had tried to fight it, claiming Fader Kugo was part of the gang. The next day, he was beaten to an inch of his life by the gang by a chance encounter.

“That’s it! I'm killing him.” Roks hand went to his pistol and Adam stopped him. 



“Stopp, let's be smart about it. I want something on him; if we can get him to admit what he did, then we can arrest him and release them from their bounds.” Adam said, and then the second oldest. Maya shook her head.

“No, they are waiting for him at the colony. He sent a message to them telling them about your ship. They are planning to steal it. That’s why he wants us to distract you guys and wear these ridiculous clothes.”  She said. Roks and Adam looked at each other, and then Adam looked at her.

“When did he send the message?” Adam asked

“Yesterday as we are getting closer. We arrive tomorrow, right?” She replied and Skee looked at her. 

“How do you know this?” She asked, confused.

“He always wants me to sleep in his bed. Remember, he thought I was sleeping as he sent the message.” She replied, and Adam looked at the sleeping fader.

“What system did he use? His own or the ships?” He asked.

“Your ships, he is so impressed by it. He wants it for himself.” She replied and Adam got up and walked over to a terminal.

“The computer showed me all the messages Fader Kugo sent, and three messages popped up. The first was about the girls with a clear indication of being put to work, and the second was the description of the ship and Adam and Roks. There was a reply from somebody about how they would get ready to take the ship; the last made it go cold down his back; not only were they planning to take the ship, but he asked them to get a crew ready so they could raid Dirt. He turned to Roks.

“Toss him into the airlock now while I stop the ship. We are not going there. He is a pirate, and I'm going to sentence him before we toss him out.”

He said coldly, and Roks grinned. He immediately moved over, lifted up the drunk fader, placed him in the airlock, injected him with sober medicine, and walked out of the airlock. Adam stopped the ship in the dead of space, then walked to the airlock and simply played the three messages. 

The fader looked at them as he stood up. “They will find you and kill you for this. My people will have you killed! And they will find those bitches families and kill them too. “

“In the name of the federation I, Adam Wrangler, captain of Dream and clean leader of the Wrangler clan, sentence you to death for planning to commit piracy on my ship and suspicion of extortion of the family Laf.  We are confiscating your cargo, and the cargo that was supposed to be sent to your team, which we now know is waiting for us. We will inform the law when we return to the hub. May whatever gods you believe in have mercy on your soul. Because I don’t, I curse you to the coldness of space forever.”  With those words, he pressed the button, and The fader vanished into the cold, dark space.

“Let's get you girls safely home.” Adam turned and went up to the bridge to set the course for the hub. 

 The girls looked surprised, and the younger panicked for a moment. Skee ran after him as Maya calmed her sister.

“What are you going to do with us? If you send us home, they will just kill us. You might have killed our parents by doing this. Those guys are not the forgiven type.”  She seemed worried and on the brink of panicking.

“We must report it, or they can claim we are pirates.” He took a deep breath. “I can't believe I'm going to say this… “He turned to look at her. “I know of a colony where you are safe. It’s a terraformed planet, so the atmosphere is not breathable yet, but they have space. Enough for your whole family.  So, if you accept, you can travel there and be free. We can probably pick up your parents if it's not too far away.” He looked at her, and she thought about it. 

“It's about two weeks to travel there; is that too far?” She looked at him with puppy eyes, and Adam cursed, then chuckled. 



“Aww fuck it. Why not.”

Two and a half months later, Dream landed on Dirt with a new family and a cargo filled with farming equipment. The record and some expert legal arguments from Minna had secured them the rights to the cargo and annulled the marriages of Fader Kugo. Adam saw the planet was covered with dark clouds. They got into view, and he immediately scanned the planet. The atmosphere was 70% of the desired goal, and five great lakes were being formed. However, the air was still not breathable.

I work for a USA based company, things were great at first. Very welcoming my team is really cool. Even my boss seemed great at first.

We get paid weekly but after a couple months I keep getting messages from our billing department informing me that my paid hours are being reduced. 

Of course I was mad so I asked why and they said there were lapses in my time log. Everything is logged so I went back and looked and I reached my quota that day so I asked where was the lapse, they said it’s like all the time I’m not on the phone added up. I was literally asked why each call there was time of 1-2 min I wasn’t in-call. So it adds up and I’m getting sometimes 2-3 hours off my check every week. Even though I’m sitting at the chair dialing.

One day I was sick and had to use the bathroom for awhile, I got back on and still reached my quota for the day, billings called me saying my hours will be reduced because I wasn’t on call again for an hour. I complained and asked who was making these decisions and it was my boss who’s always so encouraging and friendly with me. I’m so angry right now, I sit in my chair for 40 hours a week and I’m only getting 37 or 36 or 38 hours of pay. I hit above and beyond my quota daily. I’m afraid to even get coffee since 5 min of being away if 5 min of not being paid. I can’t fight it since my boss is also the owner of the company. 

I don’t know what to do, I need this job for rent but I’m getting ripped off for every little amount of time I spend not in a call. I hate this. I hate how I was feeling sick and still worked hard to reach the quota and this is how my company repaid me, paying me less than I deserve.

1fw2flb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1fw2flb/feeling_invisible/,Feeling invisible ,"I (38M) feel invisible.
 
When I was in my early 20s I was a stud, I was good looking and jacked, when I went out heads would turn. I would have women hit on me when I went out, or even at a coffee shop.
Female friends have told me I am good looking so based on this period of my life I believe I am a good looking man.
 
I met my partner when I was 25 and she was 24, we have been together 13 years and had 2 wonderful kids. I love them all and am not looking for anything outside of that.
 
However, me and my partner are in a dead bedroom, we usually have sex maybe 6 times a year, and its very much just for my benefit, although I always make sure my partner gets off first a few times, she is always wet and seems happy about it immediately afterwards, but then its like she forgets about it for long periods of time.
 
We had both put on weight since the kids, however since January we’ve both lost a lot of weight through diet and since August I’ve been back at the gym lifting again 3 days a week, to get my old body back to make myself as attractive as possible and to get out of the house to do my own thing which I always see advised.
 
I am not far off my body I had when I was 25, but I weigh maybe 15lbs more than then so my goal is to gain back more muscle and then diet down to lose the last bit over the next few months.
 
I see quite often people saying they started back at the gym and whilst it didn’t make a difference to their dead bedroom, they got checked out more/hit on since improving their bodies.
 
Well as expected its not made any difference to the dead bedroom, but maybe a bit narcissistically, I don’t get any looks since getting healthy again. I look about the same as when I was 25, just some greys in my hair (which is buzzed short anyway) and I just look a bit more seasoned and I don’t have a six pack (I’m working on it!), people say I look like I’m in my late 20’s not nearly 40.
 
I’m not looking for anything outside of my relationship, but damn, it would be nice for someone to look at me, so I have some kind of validation that I am still attractive

If my partner noticed or said something nice about it I wouldn’t be bothered what anyone else thought but since its made no difference at home, I want some validation as vain as that sounds.
 
I just feel invisible and unwanted, but it could be that because I feel that way at home, my confidence has taken a beating over the years and how I carry myself isn’t the same as when I was younger.
 
Can anyone else relate to this feeling is it silly to want validation or am I just hitting a mid-life crisis?",2,1728057006.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False
1fw2etl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Webhostinge/comments/1fw2etl/bluehost_customer_support_review/,Bluehost customer support review ,"When it comes to hosting your website, you can choose any provider based on features and pricing. But once the rubber meets the road, and things go sideways (because they will), it’s the customer support that makes all the difference. I’ve been using Bluehost for several years, and if there’s one area I’ve repeatedly had mixed emotions about, it’s their customer support.

***Note: Bluehost 75% - 95% coupon code is available in sidebar***

Now, let me say this right up front: Bluehost customer support has been a rollercoaster—good, bad, and sometimes downright frustrating. Over the years, I’ve had enough interactions to know what works, what doesn’t, and what might send you over the edge.

**The Good Days: Instant Solutions**

First off, when Bluehost's support works, it really works. I’ve had several instances where I hit up their 24/7 live chat, and within minutes, I was connected with someone who seemed to genuinely know what they were doing. There was one particular incident I remember. My site had gone down after a WordPress update, and I was staring at that dreaded “white screen of death.” You know, the one that makes your heart race because all your hard work seems to have vanished into thin air.

I contacted support, expecting a lengthy back-and-forth. But instead, the representative understood my problem within minutes and guided me through restoring my site via the cPanel file manager. The whole thing was wrapped up in less than 20 minutes. I could breathe again, and I was impressed with the efficiency. On a good day, Bluehost’s support feels like having a tech-savvy friend you can call when you’re in over your head.

**The Frustrating Days: Scripts, Delays, and Repetition**

But then, there are the not-so-good days. There’s nothing worse than running into an issue that’s way beyond your technical expertise, and then realizing the person on the other end of the chat is just as clueless. During peak hours, especially if you're dealing with a tricky issue, you can tell when they’re reading off a script. The repetition of pre-written responses can be maddening when all you want is for them to dive into your specific problem.

I remember one incident where my website's SSL certificate mysteriously expired even though I was sure it was supposed to renew automatically. The representative I was connected with couldn’t give me a straight answer, and after nearly 45 minutes of copy-pasted responses, I was told the issue would be escalated to a higher tier of support. This “higher tier” eventually resolved the problem—but only after two days of back-and-forth emails. Let me tell you, having your site show up as “Not Secure” for two days does not inspire confidence.

**Language Barriers and Patience Testing**

One thing I’ve noticed is that not all representatives seem equally knowledgeable. Depending on who you get, the support experience can vary wildly. There have been times where the language barrier made explaining my issue an exhausting process. It’s clear they have outsourced some of their support, which isn't inherently a bad thing, but it does lead to a lot of “Can you please repeat that?” moments.

I’ve had reps who didn't seem to fully understand the technical jargon I was using, which left me feeling like we were speaking two different languages. Other times, I’ve had experts on the line who were on top of things from the get-go. So, it’s really the luck of the draw when it comes to who handles your query.

**The Lesson: Patience is Key**

If there’s one lesson I’ve learned from all my dealings with Bluehost support, it’s this: Patience is key. I won’t sugarcoat it—there are moments when you will want to pull your hair out, especially when something simple like an SSL issue turns into a multi-day ordeal. But then, there are also those golden moments when the support comes through swiftly and efficiently.

I’ve come to expect that the first line of support may not always be enough. For more complex issues, you’re better off asking to be escalated right away. The front-line staff, while polite, might not have the technical depth you need for anything beyond basic troubleshooting.

**Conclusion: Is It Worth It?**

So, would I recommend Bluehost based on their customer support alone? It’s a mixed bag. When they’re good, they’re great. But when things go off the rails, you’ll need patience and persistence. If you're someone who’s comfortable with the occasional workaround, Bluehost support can get you through most hiccups. If you're expecting seamless, top-tier support every single time, though, you might find yourself feeling frustrated on occasion.

That said, in my experience, the good moments outweigh the bad. And when you’re knee-deep in technical issues, sometimes all you need is a little perseverance—and a good cup of coffee—to make it through to the other side.",1,1728056953.0,Webhostinge,0,1.0,False

- Introvert pero talkative naman sa mga friends or kapag nakikipag get to know. 
- Into cardgames / boardgames - exploding kittens, coup, sushi go, monopoly deal, chess, mahjong (na mi miss ko na talaga maglaro ng mahjong, if you have friends who wants to learn I can teach too or we can play if marunong kayo. I have mini mahjong set)
- Usually nasa cafes/coffee shops pag weekend para mag aral / upskill
- Puro relax/me time din pag weekends (gaming, netflix etc.) - but will try my best to make time if may mga friendly meetup
- From Pasig, maybe can travel if sinipag or di busy

1fw29ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirena/comments/1fw29ab/review_of_my_insertion_experience/,review of my insertion experience,"i got my mirena inserted on 10/2, and figured i’d share my experience for all the girlies who didn’t have a great experience with insertion:

worked out in the morning, remained hydrated, didn’t have coffee (heard that coffee can make cramps worse)

ate a nice big lunch (taco bowl!) before attending my appointment 

took ibuprofen + a hydrocodone beforehand to minimize the pain. brought my water bottle with me and had my boyfriend drive

despite all this prep work, ended up screaming during insertion. that was probably the worst pain i’ve experienced in my life, though i haven’t had a child. it may have been easier if this was done last week during my period like it should have been, but hurricane helene interfered with that plan.

anyway, the pain was absolutely horrible. i was bound to the hospital bed for the next hour and couldn’t stand up without fainting, the cramps were abysmal. the nurse left immediately after insertion (possibly mad i yelled out motherfucker as she was inserting it) and had other staff bring me a nutri grain bar

eventually made it back home once i was able to stand again. it’s now two days later and i’m still cramping and glued to my heating pad, so glad im working from home.

 just wanted to share on here in case anyone is wondering if an extreme reaction to insertion is possible. it definitely is. i was hopeful for a positive experience given all the posts on here, but unfortunately didn’t have it. good news is i shouldn’t have to worry about experiencing that again until 2032",2,1728056561.0,Mirena,0,1.0,False

1fw26tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fw26tt/a_library_tale/,A Library Tale,"I have been a library hunter this year, and have been discovering libraries to get my prep done for a competitive exam.

I have transitioned back to becoming a student after a hectic gig in consulting :') I am 24M.

A few months into my prep, I changed my library and saw a really pretty girl in the new library. The moment I first saw her my jaw dropped. Instantly, Ik she got a lot of attention... I could literally see eyes following her around. I was an extrovert in the later part of my life, but still, I was getting kinda nervous talking to her or approaching her. I really didn't wanna bother her cause we were all there to get things done, and personally, I wouldn't like it if someone disturbed me while I was focusing on something. So, one day, our convo started over a small favour (I borrowed a pen from her). I got to know what she was studying, and apparently, we both are economics grads; we instantly hit it off, at least in a platonic sense. After that, we just used to smile and greet each other when we were passing by each other's desks. This somehow became an almost daily routine. At times we caught up and talked and shared a few laughs. After that, one night, as I was leaving to go home, I walked her to the nearby bus stop, and she told me that she was bad with names; I am the same person; I am not great with names either. So I asked her what's my name, guess what, she didn't have a clue :'( So I politely reminded her, and we went our separate ways.

A few days passed by, and I was relaxing in the common area, she came and sat next to me. I discovered our interests align a lot; we both love pretty skies and dogs, we kinda give golden retriever vibes, are decently extroverted, have decent Delhi vibes, are economics students, pretty smart yet not the brightest, and we love a little bit of humour on the side. I tried not to get over my head about this. But in my head, there was this constant thought of getting to know her more. After this conversation, I playfully asked her, ""What's my name?"" If you are right I will get you coffee from your favourite place. And she instantly agreed, so I asked what if I win, and she said you will still take me out for the coffer. I lowkey blushed. And guess what, she forgot :'(. But later she could recall when she asked me for my initial. And told me we were gonna get Blue Tokai coffee. I smiled and we parted our ways. 

After days, I observed she wasn't coming to the library... I didn't have her no. or socials, so I thought she was probably sick. After a few days, I saw her in the library and, out of concern, asked what happened and all, and I could see that my suspicions were right. We made small talk and shared IG. 

Earlier, I didn't reply to her stories as I thought it would be a little creepy. I saw her posting some pics and I recognised the university...  Turns out she got into a uni. We started chatting (when she replied to one of my writings on my story), and we started texting....but she is a no-phone kinda person... So...the chats were kinda dry (coz late replies, and time not syncing)... I wanted to ask her out officially, but it could not come to that.

I don't know how to think about this now cause ik she is like a 2.5-hour drive away from me. Now, after these dry texts, she told me she would call me, but she didn't. 

I am kinda in the mix about whether she feels the same way or not. I have left hopes here though, I don't want to bother or be creepy...honestly, I don't chase people, I think that devalues self and honestly can be interpreted as creepy.

Should I make efforts here or am I right in avoiding her here.

Anyone with similar experience?,"I (27F) guess I just want to shout into the void to see if anyone thinks it's worth trying other options! Or just stay the course!

Here's my current med cocktail:

20mg Dextroamphetamine Amphetamine ER (Generic adderall)
5mg Escitalopram (generic lexapro)
Slynd birth control pill
And a 5mg IR for the adderall recently as needed for a pick-me-up if I have a long day to take around the 2-3pm crash

Currently I take all 3 together, usually around 10am!

I don't experience any sleep issues. I am bad about drinking coffee too soon after I take my meds just bc I like my little drinky drinks too much🙈 But I try not to because it makes those jitters come on. 

I tried the IR before the ER, I believe it was 10mg. But I switched to ER to see if I didn't get that slump in the middle of the day. Thing is, I still feel like I'm getting only 3-4 hours of feeling like it's *working* and then it wears off. I'm also bad about spending the *on* hours doing tasks that aren't urgent 😅

Anyone have any insight? I was diagnosed as a kid and on and off meds for forever. The longest period off was about 7-8 years. But once I got my Generalized Anxiety Disorder out of the way, I could handle stimulants better. (Yay)

I have a follow up with my doctor soon! So all of this will be discussed then, but wanted to just listen to my fellow women and see what insight yall have 🫶🏻",1,1728056220.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

One last night and 3 this morning, lol. I got my date for my 341 back in August so since then I've just put it out of mind and tried to not think about it.

  
So first, yay I remembered! LOL. 

Second, it was easy peasy! I went to my local coffee shop to do it on my laptop because I didn't want any potential distractions from my family and my coffee shop is quiet in the AM. There were about 15 other people on the call and I was #5. The trustee guy was very nice. He politely told one lady she had to find a building to go to because he's not permitted to conduct a 341 with anyone in their car and she was able to do so. 

I haven't talked to or seen my lawyer since back in April when I first met with him to get this started, although I have spoke to the paralegal a couple times when I had questions. They were always so quick to answer me, but if it weren't for Reddit I wouldn't have known what to expect so THANK YOU to those who went before me. :)

Even though all the questions were very easy to answer, my heart was still beating out of my chest until I was able to finally log off, lol. I was more concerned about having WIFI or zoom issues, but it all went very smoothly. He didn't ask for anymore documents but I got copies of my most recent paystubs just in case anyone asks for it in the near future.

  
So now I just have to wait till everything is discharged, which will probably be in December sometime. It will be such a relief to begin the new year debt free (other than my student loans). My goal now is to save up an emergency fund and then finally open up at 401k at my workplace. I will eventually get a credit card but for now I live with my sister and brother in law so I am in no big hurry. I want to work on building better financial habits before going down the credit card road again.

I really wish I had done this three years ago when I first thought about it.

Anyway… I know it all sounds harmless but what upsets me is:

1. He’s never mentioned this woman ever. Which I’ve been very clear with him before that I have no issue with you and female co-workers as long as you are transparent. I’m just upset because I know for a fact he would never let me know about this coffee meeting because he would know it would make me insecure. I talked to him about it, and he reassured that is was nothing, simply wanted to chat with her about her experience in a certain part of France. He apologized and said he would never want to hurt me. Blah blah. 

2.fyi,  I have no reason to not trust him .. we’ve been married for years. But it’s a secrecy and just not telling me things that bothers me.

3. He did end up cancelling the coffee date to reassure me. BUT later I see he deleted the entire chat… so if she or him ever msgd each other after that I would never see.. he claims he just wanted to delete the chat.

I understand this could all just be me being insecure. My biggest fear is just being made played an idiot.

Now that he was an adult, he worked on honing and improving his musical skills, which allowed him to play at his local café. Lots of people would come to hear him play. Among those people was always a strange individual dressed in a black suit and tie with browline glasses.



""Young man, come here,"" the man motioned to him, his white hair and bright green eyes standing out among the other customers.



V was reluctant because he didn't know him very well, but something about him made V feel drawn to him.



""I have this music sheet."" The man tapped his fingers on the hardwood table. ""It's no ordinary music sheet. Performing the music on it will make anyone who hears your music adore you. You'll become very popular and well known.""



""Thanks, but-""



The man raised his hand. ""I'm not selling it. I want to give it to you.""



V was surprised. No one usually gave away anything for free unless they wanted something in return. As if sensing this, the man chuckled and slid the music sheet over, sealed inside a black envelope.



""No strings attached, young man. It's all yours,"" the man smiled.



V took the envelope and thanked the man before going home.



Later that night, while relaxing in the living room, he took the envelope off the coffee table and opened it. He unfolds a scarlet-red music sheet.



Despite the blackened edges, the paper didn't appear aged at all.



V hummed to himself as he played the beat of the music out in his head.



Could something this simple make him more popular?



He would only know if he tried, and his next show is next week, giving him plenty of time to practice before then.



On the night of the show, V entered the café, his complexion pale and dark rings under his eyes. The owner was worried about his health, but V protested that he could still perform. Sitting on stage, he placed the sheet music on the rack and started strumming the guitar, filling the small café with music.



V's nose bled as he played, and the people in the crowded café seemed to blur together. Their smiles grew wider than humanly possible, and there, sitting amongst them, was the man in the black suit and tie. He raised his glass to V with a smile of his own.



What was going on?



V wiped his nose with the back of his hand, noticing the blood when he brought his hand down in line with his vision. Looking around, he watched the café patrons slump over in their seats.



The man clapped his hands to the beat of the music, chuckling.



V slumped over, going unconscious. The sound of shoes on hardwood echoed in the now silent café as the man approached the stage, picking up the music sheet.



""Thank you, young man. Without you, I would have never collected so many wonderful souls, including yours."" He pushed the browline glasses up further on the nose, his eyes glowing an eerie green. The man stood, folding up the music sheet and placing it into an inside pocket of his suit.



He whistled *La Vie En Rose,* put his hands into his pockets, and headed outside. Waiting for the bus, a young woman with light ash blonde hair walked up carrying a violin case and sat on the bench at the bus stop.



A smile spread across his lips, and he looked at the ground. He wondered if she, too, wanted to become famous and adored. For now, he would wait. After all, if she were to play in a concert hall, he was sure it would be packed full of many souls to take.

# The Impact of the Digital Nomad Visa on Dubai's Economy and Job Market

In recent years, Dubai has emerged as a coveted destination for digital nomads, largely due to the introduction of the Digital Nomad Visa. This innovative visa program allows remote workers to live in the UAE while continuing their employment outside the country. As a result, the Economic landscape in Dubai is experiencing transformation, with significant implications for both the economy and the job market.

The Digital Nomad Visa has attracted a diverse range of professionals, from tech innovators to freelance designers. This influx of talent contributes to a vibrant ecosystem and stimulates economic growth in several key ways:

* **Increased Consumer Spending:** Digital nomads bring disposable income into the city, which they spend on housing, dining, retail, and entertainment. This surge in consumer spending supports local businesses and creates jobs in various sectors.
* **Enhanced Innovation:** With a diverse workforce comes a blend of ideas and perspectives. Remote workers share unique ideas and experiences, fostering creativity and innovation in traditional industries. This leads to the development of new products and services.
* **Diverse Skill Set:** The Digital Nomad Visa attracts skilled professionals from around the globe. They not only fill gaps in the job market but also train local talent. This knowledge transfer helps to uplift the skill set of the existing workforce in Dubai.

Moreover, the presence of digital nomads can boost Dubai's reputation as a business-friendly city. The government has made significant strides in attracting international talent, and the visa has played an essential role in that strategy. As a thriving hub for digital entrepreneurship, Dubai can increase its appeal to startups and established companies alike.

The impact on the job market is also noteworthy. Here are several significant changes:

* **Evolution of Job Categories:** The demand for freelance and remote jobs has surged, prompting companies to adapt their hiring practices. New job categories are emerging, focusing on specific digital skills, which changes the overall job landscape in the region.
* **Flexible Work Environments:** The preference for remote work is leading businesses to adopt more flexible work environments. Many companies are transitioning to hybrid models that cater to both in-house and remote employees, creating a more dynamic workplace.
* **Networking Opportunities:** Digital nomads become part of a larger community, which opens up numerous networking opportunities. These interactions often lead to collaborations and new business ventures, contributing to the growth of the startup ecosystem in Dubai.

Beyond the immediate economic impulses, the Digital Nomad Visa fosters a multicultural work environment. This rich tapestry of cultures enhances creativity within businesses and encourages cross-cultural collaboration. Global exposure drives companies to think differently and stay competitive in the international marketplace.

The enhanced lifestyle offered by Dubai also plays a crucial role in attracting talent. Digital nomads enjoy high living standards, world-class amenities, and vibrant leisure activities. Additionally, tax incentives, such as 0% personal income tax, further sweeten the deal for expatriates. The benefits of living in such a dynamic city are significant, making Dubai an attractive proposition for remote workers.

The Digital Nomad Visa is not just a travel document; it serves as a catalyst for economic growth and transformation. By attracting skilled professionals, Dubai is enhancing its economy and reshaping its job market in exciting ways. Companies that can harness the talents of these digital nomads will have a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving marketplace.

As the trend continues to grow, the implemented programs and policies aimed at supporting digital nomads will likely play an increasingly prominent role in Dubai’s economic strategy. By embracing this new wave of remote work, Dubai stands at the forefront of a transformative shift in how we view work and living abroad.

# Comparing Dubai's Digital Nomad Visa with Other Global Nomad Programs

As remote work becomes more prevalent, many countries are rolling out special visa programs to attract digital nomads. Among these programs, Dubai's Digital Nomad Visa stands out for various reasons. Let’s dive into what makes Dubai's visa unique compared to other global nomad programs, helping you understand its advantages and disadvantages.

Dubai’s Digital Nomad Visa provides a secure and attractive opportunity for those eager to work remotely in a vibrant city. This visa allows you to stay in Dubai for up to a year while working for an overseas employer, making it ideal for professionals wanting to enjoy a luxurious lifestyle alongside their jobs.

When comparing the Dubai Digital Nomad Visa with similar programs, several key differences and similarities emerge. Let's break down some aspects:

* **Spain:** The proposed digital nomad visa asks for a minimum income of €2,000 monthly and provides a path toward a longer stay.

The cost of living plays a crucial role in determining how feasible a digital nomad experience can be. Here’s a quick comparison:

* **Portugal:** Offers a relatively low cost of living compared to Western Europe, but can vary depending on the city.
* **Spain:** Moving to Spain can often be budget-friendly, particularly if you choose smaller towns over major cities.

1fw1w73,https://www.reddit.com/r/MI_transgender_friend/comments/1fw1w73/the_value_of_transgender_networking/,The Value Of Transgender Networking,"Yesterday, I had the pleasure of having lunch with a new trans woman acquaintance. She is a young woman I met through discussions on another forum and we met at a mutually convenient restaurant.

We had a delightful conversation, covering both our histories, our jobs and pop culture. Happy to say, I made a new friend.

And this is exactly the sort of results I hope for others here on this sub.

I know I sound like a broken record, but I believe the transgender community is so much stronger when we form friendships through face-to-face meetings. For me, that usually comes in the way of lunches that I propose to other trans people I've encountered online. It's difficult at times to break through and get them to trust my outreach, but generally they agree. And I can say that each time I've come away feeling uplifted and reaffirmed and I hope my lunch companion does as well.

Personal interactions are incredibly important in all person's lives, not just transgender people. I'm naturally a loner and in my younger years, I rigorously kept to myself.  The reason for that is something you can understand: I just never ""fit in"" with most groups of cis people. Outnumbered by multiples, I was always the guy (and yes, I as still a ""guy"" in those years) in the corner at a party, quietly surveying the goings-on.

Nobody that I knew at the time was gay, and certainly not transgender. So, I withdrew into myself and the only outward expression of my inner self came in the way of my edgy clothing choices. Satins and silks and sequins, when I could get away with it. But such fashion choices isolated me even more from the staid cis ""normals"" I associated with.

I can honestly say it wasn't until the advent of the internet that I began to blossom. Finally, incrementally, I found individuals like me in cyberspace. Slowly, a confidence grew inside me. I wasn't the only person in the world dealing with this inner turmoil. I WAS part of a group, even though I had never met any of them in real life.

That had to change. Internet connections were wonderful, but I craved human interaction. Sitting across from another flesh-and-blood person who was living my experience, my life. I was fortunate to meet a few over the years, but those meeting were very few and far between. So, earlier this year, I began initiating meet-ups, casual, platonic chats over coffee or lunch. As an added incentive, I generally treat for the meal. To this point, each such meet-up has been all I could have hope for. I feel stronger each time and more a part of a community than I have felt before.

Which is why you see me prattle on about setting up lunches and coffee klatches and touting any sort of group interaction within the local Michigan trans community I find. In fact, at my lunch yesterday, my new friend mentioned several Facebook groups that may of interest to people on this sub.

Both are in Washtenaw County, but I'm sure other communities have similar Facebook groups. The first is **Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Nonbinary and Trans Folx**: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/314333076398618](https://www.facebook.com/groups/314333076398618)

And the second is **Ypsilanti Rainbow Neighbors**: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/179866272097667](https://www.facebook.com/groups/179866272097667)

Thankfully, both groups are private, which should lessen the chance of transphobes and chasers taking them over.

There are also local Discords dedicated to our community to which my new friend belongs. I'll post those when she sends me invites via Discord. If you are unfamiliar with that platform (which, until recently, I was as well), you need an invitation from someone already a member before you can join. You may want to check with people in your own peer group if they belong to any Discords and can send you an invite.

For my part, I'm still going to extend my invitations to our sub's members to join me for lunch, or even just coffee if you're so inclined. I want to meet you all and to build our community. Even if I'm doing it just one person at at time.

Hope to meet you soon!

“I need to go, could you please stay with Noah? I don’t know how long I’ll be there” I say absent mindedly as I pick up my handbag.
“Sure. I’ll be there as soon as I can get my mother to come baby sit him” Rowan responds but it is drowned by the ringing in my ears.
Nothing much registers as I say goodbye to my son and leave. I get inside my car and begin to drive to the hospital. My mind completely lost in memory.
Growing up, you could say that I was emotional neglected. I was the child that none of my parents cared that much about. Father’s favorite was my older sister, Emma. He used to call her his baby girl. His princess. Mother’s favorite was my older brother Travis. He was her handsome boy. I was no one favorite. I was just Ava.
I always felt unwanted. Unwelcomed. Not only with my parents but also with my siblings. No matter what I tried to do, good grades, sports, school clubs. I always remained in the sidelines. I always felt like a stranger looking in. Never part of the big happy family.
After what happened nine years ago, the little relationship I had with my family became none existence. Travis rarely talked to me and he and father would even go to great lengths to downright snub me. Mother wasn’t much different. She only talked to me or called when she had something important to tell me. With my sister that was a completely different case. We haven’t seen or talked to each other in nine years. The last words she told me was that I was dead to her. That she no longer had a sister.
Now here I am. Driving to the hospital because father has been shot and all I feel is numb. Despite everything that has happened. Shouldn’t I be feeling something more? Maybe sadness?
What are you supposed to feel when you’re told that the father who shunned you all your life is lying in bed with a bullet wound? How am I supposed to react? And is it weird that I feel nothing?
The whole drive to the hospital is reflective. As I think of my childhood and even part of my adulthood. The pain and hurt is still there. I don’t think the pain of rejection from my own family will ever go away.
That’s who I am. A rejected woman. First by my family, then by my husband and in laws. The only one who accepts me and loves me just the way I am is Noah.
It doesn’t take long to get to the hospital. We had one main big hospital in this town and I just knew that’s where my father was.
Parking my car, I get out. The cool evening air ruffles my hair. I take a deep breath and square my shoulder before entering the building.
“I’m looking for James Sharp, I believe he was brought in for a gunshot wound” I tell the receptionist once I get to the front desk.
“Any relation?” she asks.
“He’s my father”
She nods her head. “Give me a minute.” She pauses while she types on her computer. “Right, he is in the ER, getting prepped for surgery. Just go straight ahead, at the end you’ll see the emergency door. You’ll find your family there”
“Thanks”
I turn around and follow her instruction. My heart beating with every step I take.
‘He’s going to be okay. He’ll recover soon and go back to his old self’ I whisper to myself.
Despite our differences I wanted him to be well. He and I may not have a relationship but he’s loving towards Noah and that’s all I can ever ask for.
I push the door and enter. I immediately spot mother and Travis on the waiting chair. I school my features and approach them.
“Mother, Travis” I say as a way of greeting.
They both look up at me. Mother’s eyes are bloodshot from crying and her blue sundress is covered in blood. Travis’ eyes are dry but you can still see how much this is affecting him. He was trying to keep it together for mother’s sake.
I take a sit next to her. “What happened and how is he doing?”
The question brings on about of fresh tears.
“He was shot twice on his way back from the store, right outside our house. I called the ambulance immediately and we brought him here. The doctors say one of the bullets pierced his lungs and the other his kidney. They’re preparing him for surgery” her voice catches at the end.
I nod my head. I want to comfort her. To hug her, but I don’t think my touch would be welcomed.
“Don’t worry. Father is the strongest man I know. He’ll be okay” I try to reassure her.
She doesn’t say anything. Just continues to cry.
Minutes later they bring father out. He’s dressed in a hospital gown and is lying on a hospital bed. Travis and mother immediately stand up and rush to his side.
I stay seated. I’m pretty sure my face is the last thing he wants to see. He would rather it be Emma’s.
I watch as mother cries over him. He weakly wipes her tears but they keep falling. He tells Travis something and Travis nods. His face etched in determination. Before they take him away, I see him hand over what looks like a paper to mother. This brings fresh tears running down her face.
She kisses him and they wheel him away. Mother and Travis come back and take their seats. We don’t talk as we begin the long wait.
I stand up, I pace, I sit back down. I get everyone coffee. As each minute passes, I grow more anxious and so do the rest. Two and half hour later, the doctor comes to the waiting.
From the somber look on his face, I just know that father didn’t make it. Mother senses the same thing because she starts hiccupping.
“He went into cardiac arrest, we tried everything we could, but we weren’t able to save him. I’m sorry for your loss” he says.
The sound that tears out of mother’s lips is animalistic. Full of pain and sorrow. Travis catches her before she falls and they both sink to the floor. Both crying at the loss.
Father was dead and I knew that meant that Emma would have to come back.

* But when I click Follow from my phone or desktop, the Apple pod app crashes. 
* The app is saying I am following the show but it never populates the show my Apple library. 

Several friends have tested and the same thing is happening to them. Obviously, this will massively hurt the show getting out there.

So, I stumbled upon Lance Hedrick's AeroPress recipe that suggested a 9-minute brew time. I thought, “Who has that kind of time?” After some trial and error, I managed to whip up a really tasty cup in just 5 minutes by using a finer grind than what his recipe called for. Plus, I brewed at a lower temperature. I was amazed at how much sweeter it tasted compared to my V60 brews!

In the past, I was grinding my beans pretty coarsely for the V60 to avoid stalls and keep my brew time around 3:30 to 4:00 minutes. If I brewed longer, I’d end up with bitterness or astringency.

I remembered learning about pour strength and how different pouring techniques can affect the brew (thanks, Aramse!). It turns out that too much agitation can be a real problem for decaf coffee, making it more likely to stall. Then I saw another video from Lance about his 1-pour method, which made me think that fewer pours might mean less agitation.

Today, I decided to put some of these ideas together for brewing decaf in the V60:

* Used a slightly finer grind than usual
* Brewed at 85°C
* Followed the Tetsu 4:6 recipe
* Did all 5 pours with high agitation

The brew time ended up being around 5:45 to 6 minutes, and let me tell you—it was deliciously sweet with juicy acidity and zero bitterness or astringency. I think I might be sacrificing a bit of clarity for that sweetness, but I'm excited to keep experimenting with different beans!

I arrived and the dog is fine. It's not doing any of the things they said were an issue for the previous sitter. He's very sweet and unbothered by me being here. 

The house however is in an absolute state! Food everywhere, dirty floors, nowhere to sit, dirty plates, used pots and pans ,old coffee cups , old juice with flies in -house stinks of smoke. There is dirty clothes and baby wipes strewn around.  Chocolate just left lying around. Just general awful. I sent photos to the owner as I'm not sure if was left like that by them or the previous sitter. 

My question is - the owner hasn't accepted the new booking - I assume rover will pay me under the guarantee but has anyone had this happen before? How do you get compensated. 

This isn't going to be a fun one - at least the dog is easy enough.

What I’m Looking For: I’m looking beta readers to give feedback on the first draft of my novel. I’m specifically looking for feedback on the overall plot, character development, pacing, and consistency. 

Blurb: Addie never expected her summer job at Black Ink Coffee to come with strings attached. Hired as a barista after her first year of college, she’s just trying to support herself through school to create a better future. Then she meets Pierce—the tattooed, mysterious owner who’s made it clear that he doesn’t get involved with his staff. But the undeniable attraction between them soon proves impossible to resist, and they dive into what they think is a summer fling. 

When Addie discovers she’s pregnant, their carefree arrangement turns into something much more complicated. As Pierce wrestles with the demons of his high-society family, Addie must confront the grief of losing her mother, a wound that’s never fully healed. 

With both of their worlds unraveling, Addie and Pierce are forced to face their fears and decide if they can build a life together—or if their broken pasts will keep them apart for good. 

Excerpt: “I’ve never felt that way about anyone,” I admit quietly. That’s why this is so difficult. What I feel for Pierce isn’t like the friendship I have with Emily. It’s deeper, more intense, and it scares me. It’s new and unfamiliar territory, and I don’t know how to navigate it.

As the truck rumbles down Main Street, I watch the sleepy little town pass by. The shops and restaurants are all dark, their lights out for the night. The only illumination comes from the street lamps, casting a warm glow through the sunroof. It’s peaceful.

When Pierce turns down a side street and pulls into the parking lot behind Black Ink, I’m caught off guard. “It’s a bit early for my shift, don’t you think?” I joke, trying to lighten the mood, but there’s a tension in the air that wasn’t there before. Pierce’s hands grip the steering wheel so tightly that the veins in his forearms are visible, and his jaw is clenched in a way that makes my heart skip a beat.

I unbuckle my seatbelt and turn to face him; concern etched on my face. “What’s wrong?”
He sighs deeply, closing his eyes and pressing his forehead against the steering wheel. “You’ve never felt this way about anyone?” he asks, repeating my earlier words. I shake my head, my hands fidgeting nervously in my lap.

“Not really,” I say softly, my voice barely above a whisper.

Pierce takes a deep breath, then turns his head to look at me, his hazel eyes dark in the dim light. His gaze is intense, piercing through me in a way that makes me blush. I can tell he’s wrestling with something, his expression a mixture of frustration and something else I can’t quite place.

“You okay?” I ask, sliding closer to him in the space between us. I place my hand on his thigh, hoping to offer some comfort. His gaze drops to my hand, and he takes his hand off the steering wheel, placing it on top of mine. His fingers wrap around mine, his thumb gently stroking the top, sending a shiver down my spine. I should pull my hand away, but I don’t. 

The air in the truck is thick with tension, but it’s different now. It’s no longer the uncomfortable tension of unspoken words and unresolved feelings. It’s something else, something electric, something that feels like it could change everything in an instant. 

He squeezes my hand, his touch both firm and reassuring, before sitting up. His gaze locks onto mine, a mixture of determination and desire flickering in his eyes. 

“Fuck my stupid rules,” he mutters with a low growl, his voice thick with frustration. Before my mind can fully process his words, I feel his lips crashing against mine with a fierce, consuming urgency.

I instinctively wrap my arms around his neck, pulling him closer as our bodies intertwine. This kiss is a world away from the tentative, exploratory one we shared the other night. It’s no longer gentle and restrained; it’s raw and hungry, filled with all the tension that’s been building between us. I moan deeply into his mouth as his teeth nip at my lower lip, tugging it just enough to heighten the intensity before he deepens the kiss.

If there's one thing l'm pretty much excited about, it must be cooking for you at my flat. Then we get to watch movies together and enjoy our time with each other.

I love taking pictures. Once we get to know each other well, I'll show you my IG full of wonderful photos from the places I've visited. Hopefully, when we're together, my albums will also be filled by wonderful photos of our adventures around the world (Europe first, then somewhere else).
I prefer someone also from here in London. So I can be with you regularly and we can spend quality time. I'm not sure if I can do long distance again since I have trust issues coming from the past. But let's see if it'll work.

I'm just a simple guy, not very hard to please. If you've reached this part and you're game with everything, maybe you can send me a message and let's see where it goes?

Now that he was an adult, he worked on honing and improving his musical skills, which allowed him to play at his local café. Lots of people would come to hear him play. Among those people was always a strange individual dressed in a black suit and tie with browline glasses.



""Young man, come here,"" the man motioned to him, his white hair and bright green eyes standing out among the other customers.



V was reluctant because he didn't know him very well, but something about him made V feel drawn to him.



""I have this music sheet."" The man tapped his fingers on the hardwood table. ""It's no ordinary music sheet. Performing the music on it will make anyone who hears your music adore you. You'll become very popular and well known.""



""Thanks, but-""



The man raised his hand. ""I'm not selling it. I want to give it to you.""



V was surprised. No one usually gave away anything for free unless they wanted something in return. As if sensing this, the man chuckled and slid the music sheet over, sealed inside a black envelope.



""No strings attached, young man. It's all yours,"" the man smiled.



V took the envelope and thanked the man before going home.



Later that night, while relaxing in the living room, he took the envelope off the coffee table and opened it. He unfolds a scarlet-red music sheet.



Despite the blackened edges, the paper didn't appear aged at all.



V hummed to himself as he played the beat of the music out in his head.



Could something this simple make him more popular?



He would only know if he tried, and his next show is next week, giving him plenty of time to practice before then.



On the night of the show, V entered the café, his complexion pale and dark rings under his eyes. The owner was worried about his health, but V protested that he could still perform. Sitting on stage, he placed the sheet music on the rack and started strumming the guitar, filling the small café with music.



V's nose bled as he played, and the people in the crowded café seemed to blur together. Their smiles grew wider than humanly possible, and there, sitting amongst them, was the man in the black suit and tie. He raised his glass to V with a smile of his own.



What was going on?



V wiped his nose with the back of his hand, noticing the blood when he brought his hand down in line with his vision. Looking around, he watched the café patrons slump over in their seats.



The man clapped his hands to the beat of the music, chuckling.



V slumped over, going unconscious. The sound of shoes on hardwood echoed in the now silent café as the man approached the stage, picking up the music sheet.



""Thank you, young man. Without you, I would have never collected so many wonderful souls, including yours."" He pushed the browline glasses up further on the nose, his eyes glowing an eerie green. The man stood, folding up the music sheet and placing it into an inside pocket of his suit.



He whistled *La Vie En Rose,* put his hands into his pockets, and headed outside. Waiting for the bus, a young woman with light ash blonde hair walked up carrying a violin case and sat on the bench at the bus stop.



A smile spread across his lips, and he looked at the ground. He wondered if she, too, wanted to become famous and adored. For now, he would wait. After all, if she were to play in a concert hall, he was sure it would be packed full of many souls to take.



He just had to wait for the time and place to make an offer.",2,1728054178.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1fw1at2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fw1at2,Fellow really needs to fix the Stagg EKG,"This is a little bit of a vent post but I'm wondering how so many people are having the same issues with the EKG without any resolution. Fellow is a very well respected brand that's known for design and ease of use, specifically with their kettles, which has thrown me a little bit. So far I've had 3 different Stagg EKGs and a couple Carter mugs that I have very mixed feelings on. 

I started off with a blue EKG in May 2023 but immediately returned it. The blue color looks great in stock photos, however when you see it in person, there are 3 separate blues. The lid, body, and base all are notably different shades no matter what light it's in or how you angle the different pieces. I was pretty annoyed at this given the price and focus on design so I emailed Fellow expecting to hear that there was a quality spill or something. Instead, I was informed it's perfectly normal and concluded that Fellow edits their photos to hide this fact. I returned the blue EKG and replaced it with a green EKG Pro. I attached a picture of the blue one that I got along with a stock image.

The green is a much better match color-wise, but then I had issues with the app. First off, the only useful feature of the app is updating firmware... everything else can be done without the app (it's arguably easier that way too, opening an app and finding settings takes 10x as long as pushing the menu button on the kettle base). However, the update failed and the app would no longer connect with the kettle. I tried the update a few more times by deleting the kettle and re-adding it, but nothing worked. Eventually I just forgot about the app since there's really no purpose for it besides firmware updates, which shouldn't be necessary anyways unless there are bugs in the existing firmware. This was actually comical to me at the time because of how Fellow pushes wifi on the EKG Pro as a ""game changing evolution"" without really giving any benefit even if it worked correctly. Doing some digging on Reddit, I'm far from the only person with this issue. Give me a green standard EKG with pre-boil and I'd be happy as a clam.

Fast forward a year, and I had to replace my green EKG Pro through no fault of Fellow's. I bought another one and after using it for a few days, started noticing things like temperature freezing on the screen, saying it's still pre-boiling when I can tell it isn't running, showing 78 F when pre-boiling finishes, etc. Lifting the kettle off the base and setting it back down updates the screen, but it's very annoying and honestly shouldn't happen with a $225 electric kettle. Now for the fun part... I reached out to Fellow's tech support and after numerous emails, their only suggestions have been to reset the base and complete any available firmware updates. Guess what? The firmware updates still do not work with the new kettle after more than a year. This is shocking to me because I can't imagine that I'm the only one who's had this issue but at the same time, it's been going on for more than a year. What gives? Why bother developing wifi and an app for a kettle, especially when Fellow doesn't seem to care if it works?  This is something I'd expect from a cheap Amazon brand and is the only reason to pay multiple times more for an EKG. They are replacing the base to Fellow's credit, but I'm still wondering how firmware updates are expected to randomly start working with kettle number 3 when there's plenty of evidence that this is a wide spread issue. The display problems are the same situation... people have been reporting them for months.

This is more of a minor complaint because overall I loved the Carter mugs, but they aren't dishwasher safe and Fellow specifically calls out the powder coated finish as the reason they can't go through a dishwasher. Again, a relatively expensive product that clearly had a lot of thought put into it but with a major flaw that easily could have been fixed. It's awesome that most decent vacuum insulated tumblers are dishwasher safe now and I expected that with the Carter, so a finish that isn't dishwasher safe is a really odd choice. Yeti tumblers have a visually identical finish but can go in the dishwasher, and cost less... do better Fellow.

TLDR: the blue Fellow EKG's parts are all different shades and they must edit their stock photos, the app has been entirely useless for over a year but nobody seems to care, I'm getting a base warrantied because of a common problem where the display doesn't work right, and they designed the Carter mug to hold vacuum in a dishwasher but gave it a finish that requires hand washing. I'm not seeing how Fellow justifies their prices or keeps their reputation among coffee lovers if I'm honest, and am very glad that I recently sprung for a Timemore 078 instead of an Ode with SSP burrs. Let that sink in for a minute. ",1,1728054154.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

1 year 4 months

Spayed female

87 lbs

Negative for heartworms

Luna is a sweetie pie! She's a little shy at first but opens up and becomes playful and snuggly. She adores attention and petting and will scooch closer so you can get a better angle for scritching her ears. She walks well on the leash and knows both sit and shake. Come meet Lunna today!

**Medical**

Lunna was recently adopted and returned after experiencing bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Thankfully, parvo test was negative. Her fecal test revealed hookworms, so we started her on probiotics and a course of dewormer. Good news, that seemed to do the trick! She's eating and defecating normally now.

**Playgroup Assessment**

8/27: A bit timid, fitting better with the more gentle and reserved group of dogs. She would start to warm up to things and engage with the others more once feeling warmed up to things. PG 1 Social, Dainty/Gentle play style

10/3: Feeling more comfortable in the group, interacting with the dogs more and participating in gentle play with them too. PG 1 Social, Dainty/Gentle

Ive been on Strattera for a little over 6 months.
What Ive been told and what I see everyone writing here, is that stratrerra will build up in your body over time. 

Now, I am not unsure about whether Strattera is working for me or not. It absolutely does! Its just that, I am one of those people where I felt it working from day one. I felt a huge difference from the first day I took it.

It litterally wakes my brain up and clears the brain fog that I have otherwise, and it makes my sensory sensitivites go away and stabilizes my mood. It is a huge difference every single day!

However, I dont feel that Strattera works for me 24/7, aka has build up in the body. When I was on 40 mg, I had days where I would feel it stop working in the afternoon, and it was especially noticeable because I would start to feel easily overwhelmed. Mornings were especially hard, as I would feel cranky and easily dysregulsred until the pill would start working again. 

Now Ive been on 80 mg for almost a month. I no longer feel that the medication stops working midday, but mornings are still the same. Sometimes I feel like those ""dont talk to me until Ive had my coffee"" people, or rather ""dont talk to me until my Strattera pill starts working"". 

When people say it builds up in your body, arent you supposed to feel pretty mellow 24/7 and not feel such a big difference before and after taking the pill? 

I also never felt like stratrerra became more effective for me over time. It either works or it doesn't. I was on 40 mg for a long time, and over time it actually worked worse and worse because I guess my body got used it and metabolized it faster? I took 60 mg for about a week, and it did nothing for me. Then I hopped on to 80 mg and it has been working more consistently for me since the first time I took that dose. 

I feel like im having the opposite experience of what most people are describing. ",3,1728053508.0,StratteraRx,3,1.0,False

I work in a small, cozy café that prides itself on serving simple drinks and delicious pastries. We don’t have an extensive menu, just the basics. But we do what we do well—at least, that’s what most people say. Then there’s *him*. He started coming in every Tuesday and Thursday morning, and every single time it’s an adventure in customer service.

Customer: *“I’ll take a double ristretto with half-caf, room temperature, almond milk, and a dash of nutmeg. And don’t forget to froth the milk properly this time.”*

Me: *“We don’t have almond milk. Or nutmeg. And our machine does one shot at a time. I can do two singles for you though, if that works?”*

Customer: *“What kind of café doesn’t have almond milk or nutmeg?!”*

Me: *“The kind that specializes in scones and drip coffee.”*

Cue the dramatic sigh, eye roll, and purchase of an Americano instead. He tells me it’s the worst coffee he’s ever had as he leaves. I’m unfazed. This is becoming routine.

Thursday rolls around, and guess who walks back in?

Customer: *“I see you haven’t upgraded your menu yet. I’ll just take a macchiato, double shot, with oat milk, extra foam.”*

Me: *“We still don’t have non-dairy milk, and the macchiato comes with a single shot. You can have two if you want though.”*

Customer: *“How can you call this place a café? I can’t believe people pay for this!”*

Me: *“The muffins are popular.”*

He grumbles something under his breath, hands over his money, and storms out with his *single-shot, dairy-only* macchiato.

The following Tuesday, the madness continues. But this time, it’s worse. He brings a friend.

Customer: *“This is my friend Mark. Mark, try not to let this place ruin your taste buds.”*

Mark looks nervous but orders a plain black coffee. He’s smart. Then, the regular goes off on a tirade.

Customer: *“You still don’t have any specialty milks, huh? Guess I’ll just have to lower my standards again. Two lattes, regular milk. And don’t make it too hot. I have sensitive teeth.”*

I make the drinks, Mark looks like he’s planning an escape route, and once again, I hand over two perfectly normal, perfectly fine lattes.

Customer: *“This is too hot! How is it possible to mess up such a simple request?!”*

Me: *“I can remake it.”*

Customer: *“Forget it! Your coffee is a crime against humanity.”*

Mark: *“It’s fine, really. Tastes great to me.”*

The customer glares at him, grabs his cup, and dramatically exits.

Fast forward to Thursday, and he’s back, but this time it’s just him—no Mark. As I’m preparing for his usual absurd order, a woman who works at the café down the street walks in to grab a scone for her break.

Café Worker: *“Hey, how’s it going? Oh, no way, he’s here?”*

Me: *“Oh, you know him?”*

Café Worker: *“Of course. He’s been banned from every coffee shop in town. Yours is the last place left serving him.”*

Customer: *“I HEARD THAT!”*

Two weeks later, he got himself banned from here, too, after he threw a cup of scalding-hot coffee at the counter because the “temperature wasn’t ideal.”

But for some reason in 2020, while we were all stuck at home, I got back into coffee. It was fun and I bought frothers and syrups and made my own lattes at home. Fast forward to now, four years later, and I’m drinking 2 large cups of coffee a day to get by. 

While my anxiety isn’t the worst it’s been, I’m annoyed at myself because those 2 cups of coffee I’m slowly growing tolerant to and I find I need a third. And that’s just crazy to me. 

So I’ve been slowly cutting out caffeine these last two weeks! I’m a woman that gets cycle related migraines and the last thing I need is to cut out coffee cold turkey and get MORE headaches. I’m currently on 1 cup a day and my plan this weekend is to substitute my coffee with one cup of early gray tea for a week or so before stopping altogether.

__
In Cambira, a municipality in the state of Paraná, the population is familiar with the legend of Corpo-seco, which originated in the 1950s.

According to the inhabitants of Cambira, Corpo-seco was a man who had promised to walk to the city of Aparecida do Norte if he became rich. The man, a German immigrant known as Ervin Schindler, indeed became wealthy. He founded the Ubatuba farm, which became one of the largest coffee producers in the region. As promised, he went to the city of Aparecida do Norte, but by plane instead of walking.

In another version of the story, the man died during the journey. Today, according to locals, at the spot where the man was buried, truck drivers passing by are surprised by someone knocking on the window, asking for a ride to Aparecida do Norte.

However, when they reach the place where Corpo-seco had the accident, the man who asked for a ride disappears from the truck.

Tim Miller sits across from me on the ground, all the tables and chairs having been removed and the floor carpeted over with what might have been rattlesnake skin. 

There are papers scattered between us. I pick one up. It's a research summary of the efficacy of various vaccines, populated by bar graphs. I'm not a medical professional, and don't know how to read this in a way to get any useful information out of it. I look up at Tim, who sneers at me briefly. The whole world turns red for two seconds before turning back to normal.

""That one works?"" he questions, pointing at one of the graphs on his own copy of the data. ""I could have sworn that company was too new to get anything real done yet.""

""That's how this works!"" shouts Sarah Longwell somewhere behind me. ""You can't really tell which company is going to make a vaccine that works, you just need to follow the science.""

I don't turn around. Tim gets lost in shuffling papers as JVL squeegees the windows, hanging off the side of a moving train car in the rain.

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

I love all kinds of music. Mainly older things like Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, I could go on and on. I'm definitely a bit of an old soul. 70s and 80s rock, 90s stuff and of course good old emo music from the 2000s

Finally, new episode starts on...bf. So sharjeena brings mustafa nashta in his room and he asks her why they can't have it outside, so sharjeena's sobstories begin that she can't stand others mistreating him, 'Koi tumhain inferior feel karwaye, tumhain disrespect karay mujh say bardasht nahi hota.' 


Yeah she forgot when she had announced to marry him, how her own sister was mocking mustafa. And how her abba still insults him.

Then guess what mustafa asks for??? Guesssss, guess guesss? 
Chai and makhan. 

Next scene I think was written by some 10 yr old. So all of adeel's dialogues, I mean they were so stupid I am not even gonna write about em. 





https://reddit.com/link/1fw0th7/video/wzpj38dv3rsd1/player




Like, why would someone living amongst countless luxuries like adeel and a very practical guy would pine for sharjeena and....just because she makes chai and breakfast for her guy? If anything he would go for someone from his own class.



Also why such sleazy music each time adeelbhai is on screen?


Acha now TUTORIAL, how to make BLACK  COFFEE.

 Anyways, then rubab comes out dressed up for work and finds sharjeena standing outside leaving for work. So, she starts asking her tuhhhmmm mujh sahhhyy naharazzz tahuhhh nahihhh hoo, tuhmmm laghhtii hoo bechhauuseee mahhyyy nayhhhh aahdeel sahyyy shaddhhdii karhhh li.

So, sharjeena tells her none of them, adeel or ruhbab are imp enough for her in her life. 

While she is saying this, adeel enters the lounge and hears all of it. 



https://preview.redd.it/o4229t0v3rsd1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13c59a17d1a86708680a2e239ad3a212a751db55

So, they all leave for work and adeelbhai asks mustafa to open the gate and wait for him to leave and shut it too. All of which is seen as disrespect by sharjeena, so she tells him to leave the gates open, let adeelbhai do on his own. Soooooo, that annoys adeelbhai and everyone finally daffan hona for work. Subah subah hee.

Then rubab pesters adeel over abzzurd stuff, that he is jealous of podeena and mustafa living happily together. 

So, adeelbhai says, 'Either you are out of your mind ya may pagal hoon, tumharay jaisi shandar biwi k hotay why would I care about that girl'. 


Okayyy guys so now comes the next new trrrrackkkkkk. Salman and Natasha.

I feel bad for actor playing Salman, guy is constantly weight-shamed in the drama.

 So, he and natasha are getting ready for some place, and she keeps telling him he needs to lose weight and stop eating.

So, the guy tells her he just lives for 2 things, his wife and his food, and she reminds him all his outfits have grown tight on him due to weight gain. 


Natasha

So, the guy gets ready for a party and goes like, ohh you are looking pretty, everyone will stare at us, and Natty thinks in her head, 'not sure they will look at me or at this daiyo'. Daiyo is urdu word for umm I dunno what is english for it, maybe monster, ogre. 

But Salman guy is so lucky I wanna be 70pc his size, so lucky. 
They really do this stupid thing, they make him pose this way often.

Okay, then rubab, the rich girl is so waili, she sits and sulks in her office thinking about podeena when she has got nothing to do with her.

 Now this executive mba has nothing better to do, like is this a drama about grade school kids, she's sitting in her room and crying about assignments before mustafa and about? ....calculations, marks. Like MARKSS?? Muzz Mama 20 marks aey hain fail ho jana hai may nay, duh! On top of it the way hania was shouting those dialogues was quite grating. So, muzz has a solution, he goes to make coffee for her. Blackkk coffee. 


Acha, I dunno why adeel is shown to be addressing mustafa as loser. Like, it looks so freaking funny when a grownass adult man calls his own brother loser like 'Mustafa sahab  THE loser' - imagine and like a high school bully. Adeelbhai and mom chat and dunno why adeel badmouths muzz, and somehow tries to pin dad's attack on his careless behavior.

So, doosri jamat ki bachi sharjeena ass-ignment poori na honay pay rona dhona kar kay goes to sleep and then mustafa stays up through the night to finish it off for her. And jab tak yeh ass-ignment hoti hai 5 mins tak dholki wala music baj baj kay dimagh kharab karta hai.


 Next morning she wakes up shocked over how he managed to finish an impossibly hugeeeee ass--ignment overnight. That wins him a hug and viewers win a torturous bgm. So, yeah they talk romance and then he asks her for a Chai.

You know this was the cringiest episode. They had made adeel's character a certain way and now suddenly they are giving him a 180 deg turn. 

Like, after staying 3 or 4 days at his parents 's place, suddenly this very practical guy now thinks sharjeena is perfect lifepartner choice, just because she makes muzz nashta and chai and cooks? Does that make sense why someone with an army of servants would do that? 

Even his own wife is million times better than executivemba. So, in an abzzzzurd way he starts telling podeena how she picked a wrong guy. Now hear the jokes.

 'Kahan tum itni intellectual, parhi likhi larki and kahan mustafa jis ka kitabon say kabhi koi taluq nahi raha, tum aapas may kya batain kartay hogay. Tum itni brilliant, bright and qualified and tumhari shadi hogayi with barhawin (12th) paas bhai' etc etc. 

Like seriously who wrote these dialogues? What has she done to prove her qualified, bright, brilliant? She is literally what rubab calls her, a despo who just wanted to marry anyone even if younger bro of the guy who dumped her, that was like having no self respect when she emotionally blackmails him to marry her because izzat.

Anyways, musatafa stands outside and overhears all of it.


Like, hum kitni intellectuals wali batain karnay ki koshish kar lain log tareef tau door ki baat moonh pay lanat bhi nahi bhejtay and issay intellectual bana diya. 


Okay, so someone wanted to desperately create a trope that sharj is so awesome and adeel is regretting that but they were so drunk on kapray dhonay wala sabun mili bootleg alcohol that they didn't even bother carve out a proper scenario, so for no good reason out of vacuum, adeel keeps yammering away nonsense before her. 

So, the most funniest line he says, like imagine even maulana fazlur rehman has more achievements than sharj but adeel is telling her that: 




'Tum apnay baap ki SUPERSTAR beti ho'. 

Suuppper...what..?


Yeah I am so done with this, and can't be bothered with superstar beti's lines. Instead of hearing her BS responses, I would rather play cow mooing sound effects. 



Btw mustafa had turned back and left from the door before sueprstar beti gave counters replies to adeelbhai, so he only heard his bro's part of convo, feels low and leaves. Right then rubab enters lounge and feels shocked to see them together. Then superstar walks out and rubab gets into mini fight with adeelbhai for talking to his ex. Then, once again somehow he manages to cool her down. 





https://preview.redd.it/iauc90nu2rsd1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a725e76fd34a357ba89e2326fe405925c8d2549



Superstar goes to room to find mustafa sitting there and yet again experiencing extreme self pity. He thinks she is better than him because she carries these heavy books in arms. It was funny they were showing her carrying around those thick course books to portray her as intellectual and shiz. Like coursebooks?

Then, in their room, again rubab starts suspecting adeel and he to sucks upto her. And then they...... drink Chaiiii and next day phir sharjeena gets up to make chai and iron clothes for mustafa and yeh episode ends.

1fw0t7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fw0t7y/im_a_34m_and_my_28f_partner_ended_our_5year/,I’m a 34M and My 28F Partner Ended Our 5-Year Relationship with a Note – How Do I Move On?,"I’ve been in a relationship for five years with my now ex, and I’m struggling to understand the way things ended. I’m 34, and she’s 28. Over the years, we’ve had a history of her breaking up with me every 3 or 4 months and getting back together after I chase her back, but this time feels different.

A couple of weeks ago, she broke up with me out of nowhere. I went out to dinner, and when I came back, she was gone and she had left me a note saying that the relationship was over. She quickly blocked me on everything—texts, calls, and all social media. I emailed her every day for two weeks, and the only response I got from her  was a 19-second voice message explaining that she had been wanting to leave me for a while but she finally had the courage to leave because she “found out” that I had masturbated that week while she was at work. That was apparently the last straw for her, and she said it gave her the courage to leave. I hadn’t even done what she accused me of, but it seems like she didn’t need proof—just her assumptions. She also told one of my family members that another reason for the breakup was that I had tried to talk her into us moving to North Carolina.   

When I got back from dinner and saw the letter, I was in complete shock. The way it was done—leaving a note instead of talking to me—felt cold and impersonal, especially after five years together. Up until this moment, things seemed fine. We’d been through a lot together, including previous breakups where she left me and later came back after I chased her back, and even a situation involving her infidelity early on in the relationship. After that, we worked to rebuild trust, but now I’m wondering if it ever really came back.

Even during this breakup, I’ve tried to reach out several times, and she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to talk. She threatened to report me to HR when I sent her a message at work and even called the police when I showed up at her house with a letter trying to talk things out. That level of coldness from someone I’ve been with for five years feels brutal. It makes me question everything.

There’s also the fact that she’s left me to care for the dog that she wanted to adopt. She was so attached to him, and now it’s like she’s completely erased not just me, but everything we shared together, including the dog.

Looking back, I can see there were some issues in our relationship that might have led up to this. I know I wasn’t always the best at listening to her feelings. Sometimes when she’d bring up problems, I’d get defensive instead of hearing her out. I’ve always been more practical in how I handle issues, trying to resolve them instead of diving into the emotional side of things, but I realize now that wasn’t enough for her. I also wasn’t  initiating much intimacy in the last few months due to a new job that’s been very demanding as well as other stressors like financial worries, trying to sell our house, and dealing with a new puppy — and that emotional disconnect might have built up over time without me realizing how serious it was for her.

We’d even fought recently on a vacation to North Carolina. One fight happened because I stopped at a coffee shop that was out of the way, and she was upset about the detour. I got defensive and told her I was paying for the vacation, so I should get to stop where I want. Another fight was over me forgetting to get her a beer sample at a brewery. These small fights seemed to add up, but at the time, they didn’t feel like deal-breakers to me.

When things were good, they were really good. We’ve shared so many amazing moments over the years—vacations, building a home together, and just enjoying each other’s company. That’s what makes all of this even harder to process. She never really communicated what she wanted for the future, either. She never changed her address to our house, didn’t want much to do with renovating or decorating it, and when I’d ask about marriage or our future plans, her answers were always vague, like, “I don’t know.” Now that I look back, I wonder if she was afraid of commitment all along.

I’m an anxious attachment type, and I know that makes me more likely to seek closeness and reassurance. She, on the other hand, seems to be more avoidant. I feel like I was always the one trying to fix things, while she would pull away and shut down. I didn’t even see the breakup coming, and now I’m left with so many questions. She never explained the real reasons, and her letter and voice message don’t give me closure. Was this about me masturbating? Me wanting to move to North Carolina? Me working late the last few months? None of these reasons seem to add up to leaving someone after five years.

One of the hardest things is feeling like I never really knew what she was thinking. She seemed so happy in our pictures from just a few months ago. How does someone go from that to blocking you completely? I’m wondering if this was a fear of commitment or if she’s just afraid of long-term relationships in general. Did she think I’d leave her, so she left first? Did hitting the five-year mark make her scared of the next steps, like marriage and starting a family?

I want to believe there’s more to this breakup, but I may never know. I just wish she had been more open about what was really going on. I tried to be as honest as possible in my messages to her, but I still haven’t gotten any response. At this point, I’ve probably overwhelmed her with my constant reaching out, and I’m taking a step back to try to move on and work on myself. I’m trying to understand what I did wrong and how I could have been a better partner.

Right now, I’m trying to focus on personal growth and figure out what I can learn from all of this. It’s not easy, but I want to come out of this stronger and more aware of what I need in a relationship.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation—dealing with an avoidant partner or feeling blindsided by a breakup—I’d really appreciate hearing how you handled it or what helped you move forward.",2,1728052940.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

I’m using a basic one cup recipe in a 01 size v60. 15 grams of beans, 250g of bottled spring water @205°. 50g bloom, and four more 50g pours with a small swirl at the end to settle the coffee bed. I made honest to god 11 different brews last night going from grind setting 50 to 150, in 10 click increments. Nothing is working. Some were closer to being okay (around setting 110/120) but they were still extremely bright and acidic.

It was roasted last week so it’s had time to rest. 

I just don’t know what’s going on. With my baratza encore a setting of 14 or 16 works great and gives me a sweet balanced cup with both these coffees. Draw down is significantly longer due to the increased fines that the encore generates though.

Any ideas or tips?  Am I just not used to a cup being so clean/consistent? Maybe I just don’t like Tanzanian peaberry? It’s my first time trying it, and it’s supposed to be bright and acidic. Just didn’t think it was THAT bright. It’s like battery acid tart. It’s drinkable with milk and a little flavor syrup(I know sacrilegious). ",2,1728052786.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

We don't get breaks at work so I'm on the register for 5 hours 5 times a day just drinking coffee. So I solved that situation by getting snack bars that I eat.

Snack bars, slim jims and coffee are a majority of my calorie intake for the entire day.

I recently had to pay off a lot of bills and some medical bills for doctor visits that my insurance refuses to pay and I'm not left with much. I was forced to overdraw my debit card and I can only do so much overdrawing before I get a $100 fee per day.

In order to keep myself above the water I had to not get food for work this time. I'm freaking out wondering how I'm going to eat. The Amazon list down here is 2 weeks worth of food.

Two of the slim jim 14ct, one of the variety pack and one of the 12ct pack.

I start work tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. I only have one day of food left at work. After tomorrow I have nothing except coffee to maintain myself on.

1fw0qif,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fw0qif,"In a trending post today, I felt OP was wrong for being clingy. A commenter said OP was “fawning” for self protection and people would agree he’s a victim if genders were reversed. So Reddit, was I (girl) a manipulative gaslighter for asking not to be disturbed?","So Reddit, I dated/not dated a gentleman who didn’t leave my house for about a month. It was never discussed, he extended his stay and I welcomed him on the condition of good vibes only.

But every day he found a reason to be unhappy with me, and he always found a way to interrupt me while I was working. If I was working from home and asked for quiet, he would still interrupt me 7-8 times with a “I just miss you” or “I thought you’d care to know about XYZ, I guess you don’t” kind of attitude. His clinginess was not with good intentions, it came with devaluation as well. 

So I printed the text exchange from the night before. I work a 9-5 job. He’s unemployed and does not respect my work hours. I asked to go to the gym in the evening. He said no, let’s go in the morning the next day. I said alrighty. Next day, he had no intention of going early enough that I could still be at work on time. He said let’s go at 10am. I wasn’t home until 1pm.

Then he kept interrupting me during the day, so I decided to go to a coffee shop/restaurant/bar, anything that was open late and had a bit of energy to just get in the zone to work. He was clingy further and asked me why I did not invite him. As I left out the door I explained to him I didn’t get any work done and I just needed quiet and I’ll be back after I get some work in. I hugged the man. Not once did I blame him for my inability to work.

I don’t drink, I have never smoked or vaped and have never felt myself ever susceptible to addiction. I am pretty healthy I work out often.

However, I drink coffee, at least one energy drink maybe 2 and pre work out most days of the week. My intake is anywhere from 400mg (minimum) to 1g of caffeine a day. The days I do not have caffeine it feels like I have not slept at all. And I’m noticing now that even when I try to go a day without a Celsius, I take like 3 drinks from one and I immediately start feeling better. So it isn’t the amount of caffeine it’s some sort of dependency or something. I have tried to quit, but my workouts suffer and my productivity at work sucks and I am in sales so if I don’t do the work I don’t get the cash. No one takes caffeine addiction seriously so no one has real advice for how to stop it.

 I don’t think I’m suffering, I do not think this is killing me. But what I do think is that I have a physical dependency to a substance and I cannot find a way to stop it. God forbid I take up some other addictive substance and I do not know how to quit that either. Does anyone have any real advice?",1,1728052086.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Met on a dating app (Lysa “doesn’t love” this part of their story. Doesn't say which app, just says that she picked one that she felt more comfortable with.) 

He didn’t know who she was when they met.

He said he would fly up to Charlotte to take her to coffee. She was impressed he was willing to do this. 

She had him facetime with 2 of her close friends (seems like these 2 friends were involved in all of her dating before him too).

He’s been sober for 10 years. Lysa loves that he was humble enough to go to an AA meeting.

She also didn’t realize how important it was to be with someone who was sober and says how great it has been to be with someone who did the work to get healthy.

She said she waited “several years” to think about dating again and wanted to be okay on her own (FACT CHECK: Lysa filed for divorce from Art in December 2021, they would have been separated for a year to file in NC. She met Chaz in Jan 2023).

AA helped him get back in church and his relationship with God.

Lysa loves that she can trust him on the computer (he likes to watch surfing videos and videos on watches).

She felt safe with him and how he responded to her triggers. One example: he left earlier then planned one trip and it triggered Lysa from her previous marriage when that happened it meant bad things were going on. He could sense she wasn't okay and asked what she needed from him. Made her feel safe. 

He has cheated and has been cheated on and it’s been a long journey for him.

I started to lose interest the last third of the video because Lysa does a lot of preaching and reading from her book.

Sort of feels like an interview with her being a professional and him being the guest, but he comes across really likable and obviously really adores her.

Lysa says they’re very much in love and newlyweds but they still face hard things but she’s grateful that they have lots of honest conversations.

1fw0a3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SimonPowellGDM/comments/1fw0a3i/how_to_start_a_conversation_with_a_stranger/,How to Start a Conversation with a Stranger (Without Feeling Awkward),"I’m gonna share something personal with you. Back when I was 16, there was a girl I liked a lot at high school. We took the same bus every day, but I spent **6 months** just staring at her from a distance, afraid to approach her. I was afraid of doing the wrong thing, afraid of rejection, and honestly - I didn’t want to look stupid around other people at that bus stop.

One day, I finally found the courage to walk up to her, by coming up with the idea of asking her for a cigarette. I didn’t even smoke, but I was soo happy that I **took action**! It wasn’t smooth, but it was my first step in realizing that starting a conversation doesn’t have to be perfect.

If you're in a technical field, this story might sound familiar. Whether it's at work or in social situations, there's often an opportunity to meet someone that is associated with a fear of bothering people, fear of making mistakes, or fear of looking stupid in the process. You may end up feeling like you need to **analyze everything** or ""get it right"" before taking action – this is usually called analysis paralysis.

**Why Does This Happen?**

It’s because we’ve been taught to value precision and perfection. But when it comes to social interactions, perfection and precision are actually the enemy of any progress. The **mindset shift** I encourage my clients to embrace is: conversations don’t have to be perfect, because they never are – but they always have to get started.

Make sure to understand this: the first few seconds of a conversation, the other person doesn’t focus on what you’re saying. They are subconsciously reading your **non-verbal cues** - your body language, your tone, and your energy. So what you say matters much less than how you say it.

**Practical Steps to Start a Conversation**

1. **The Best Opener Is “Hi”** People often overthink how to break the ice, but the best way is simply to say *hi*. It may seem basic, but it works because it gets the ball rolling. If you just say that, your brain will let you come up with something else after that in order to avoid a silent awkward moment.
2. **Go With the Flow** A conversation is 50% you, and 50% the other person. Even though you might feel like you have to carry the whole interaction, conversations are co-created. Don’t stress over predicting what to say next or planning a perfect dialogue. If you’ve started it, just **be present by listening carefully**, and let the other person contribute.
3. **Break Free from “Work Talk”** For those of you who default to talking about work: make a statement that tells the other person you’re switching gears. Something like, *“I could talk about work all day, but I’m more curious about what you do for fun.”* This will let you commit to avoid the topic in the coming part of the conversation, as you would look stupid by ending up talking again about work.

**Embrace Awkwardness - A Key Mindset Shift**

Let me make this clear: **awkward moments are part of the process**. When we don’t master something yet, we tend to view every slight misstep as a massive failure. In reality, it’s the opposite. Every time you push past that discomfort, you’re teaching your brain that the world doesn’t end when you start a conversation. You don’t need to be perfect – you need to understand the mistake, learn the lesson and try again.

For example, one of my clients in Stockholm was totally isolated, spending weeks working from home without any social interaction. He was waking up at 5am and going to sleep at 8pm. After my online mentoring program, I had the chance to meet him in person. Together, we went to a few coffee shops downtown, and in just a couple of hours, he managed to meet three new people. This was a guy who was previously locked in his apartment, afraid of saying the wrong thing, overthinking about his different culture and how hostile the country he was living was with foreigners. Nothing was further from the truth. His transformation was a result of understanding that **doing is better than overthinking.**

**The Logic of Social Skills (For the Analytical Minds Out There)**

Social interactions, just like coding or engineering, can be broken down into logical steps:

1. **Initiation**: Simply saying ""hi"" or making a comment on your shared environment is all it takes to open the door.
2. **Engagement**: Once the conversation starts, listen actively. Don’t try to predict outcomes and focus on keeping the convo alive.
3. **Curiosity**: Forget about being perfect or giving the ""right"" answers. Instead, ask thoughtful questions about the person you’re talking together with. This helps you get out of your head.

These steps, when practiced, become natural. And never forget that social interactions improve through repetition, not perfection. The more you practice, the more intuitive it will become.

**Want More?**

I have a detailed framework that breaks down the entire process of reading emotional cues, building empathy, and transitioning from surface-level conversations to deeper connections. If you want access, feel free to send me a DM - I’ll be happy to share it with you for free.

Starting a conversation doesn’t have to be complicated, but it does require you to take that first step. You’ll be surprised at how fast your social confidence grows when you simply focus on starting rather than being perfect.

So next time you see someone you'd like to talk to, remember: just say *hi*.",1,1728051544.0,u_SimonPowellGDM,0,1.0,False
1fw08pj,https://i.redd.it/snjh8p750rsd1.jpeg,Made a Poppet for my toxic abusive ex ,"finally finished my poppet! 
I posted here a while ago asking advice for making my first poppet in honour of my nearly ex husband who has spent the last 16 years trying to control, manipulate and bully me along non consensual sex too. Unfortunately we are still living in the same house as I can’t move out and he refuses to move out.

I stole an old pair of his boxers and cut them up as the basic shape of the poppet. Made the mouth wide like his, blue eyes like his.

I got a small plastic bag which I stuck stinging nettles along with bind weed, a bit of manky ivy, hot foot powder, hot curry powder, chilli flakes, pepper corns and coffee in the bag. Oh, and I found a hair on his pillow too. Printed a picture of him, put his name, DOB and “f##k off and die” at the bottom of the pic. Crossed through his name and DOB but not “f##k off & die”. Put the pic in the bag with the other stuff.

I then stuffed the poppet with bits of his old boxers I chopped up and one of the dogs destroyed a dog bed so I nicked some of the manky stuffing for that for the legs etc.

Taped around the bag repeatedly to make sure the ingredients  can’t escape and shoved it in the torso and head of the poppet.

Then happily told it to f##k off and die while stabbing the “brain” and heart with purple and blue topped pins. I need some black topped pins!! Maybe red would too & I happen to have some of those.
