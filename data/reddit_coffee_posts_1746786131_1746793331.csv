Chapter 1 Betrayal on the Night of the Proposal

Inside the private room at the hotel, beneath the glittering glow of a towering ten-tier champagne pyramid, Benson Gray stood with his newly hired assistant, Sophie Scott.

The two of them were cutting a birthday cake together, their fingers interlocked.

When Sierra Shaw entered the room, Benson didn't flinch or even look guilty. Instead, he spoke as casually as if they were discussing the weather.

""Sophie has the same birthday as you. She's here all alone, far from home, with no friends. So, I decided to move your birthday party to hers for now. I'll make it up to you in a couple of days.""

Sierra's smile faltered, freezing in place as her grip on her purse slowly tightened.

Today was her 25th birthday. Benson had promised he would propose to her on this special day.

She'd worn the elegant white dress he had gifted her, spent hours perfecting her hair and makeup, and arrived at the hotel excitedly.

But the sight before her felt like a bucket of ice-cold water cascading over her head.

The engagement ring she had dreamed of—the three-carat pink diamond she had spent years imagining on her finger—was now sparkling brightly on Sophie's hand as Benson held her hand.

A sting of pain blurred her vision. Still, she forced her feet to move. Approaching Benson, she took a deep breath and pointed directly at Sophie's hand. ""What about that ring?""

Benson shrugged with infuriating nonchalance. ""It all happened so suddenly, I didn't have time to prepare a gift. Sophie liked it, so I gave it to her.""

But that was her ring, the one she had spent three years choosing meticulously, imagining every detail.

She could almost hear the sound of her heart shattering. Her eyes reddened as her voice broke. ""And me, Benson? What about me? What do you take me for?""

Benson clicked his tongue in annoyance. ""Why are you acting so childish? Haven't I celebrated enough of your birthdays over the years? Can't you let Sophie have this one for once?""

Let it go? Why was it always her who had to back down? Benson had sabotaged the deal she was about to close to boost Sophie's standing in the company. He had stood idly by as Sophie spilled coffee on her, dismissing it as Sierra being overly dramatic.

And every time Sophie made mistakes, it was Sierra Benson that was expected to clean up the mess, hiding behind the excuse of, ""those who are capable should do more"".

All these years, what exactly had Benson taken her for? Did everyone else always matter more than she did?

Tears blurred Sierra's vision. She clenched her fists, desperate to preserve the last shred of dignity she had left. Without another word, she turned and hurried toward the restroom.

Behind her, a murmur of disapproval rippled through the small crowd of friends.

""Benson, you've gone too far this time.""

""You know how much Sierra cares about this proposal, but you brought Sophie here just to get under her skin?""

Benson, utterly unbothered, continued slicing the cake. He placed one piece on a plate and handed it to Sophie.

Sophie's eyes flickered with triumph, though she quickly masked it with a nervous, apologetic expression.

""Mr. Gray, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come and upset Ms. Shaw. I'll apologize to her later, okay?""

Benson gave Sophie's shoulder a reassuring pat, his voice calm and condescending. ""It's not your fault. She's just being overly sensitive. I've been meaning to break her of this habit of throwing tantrums for no reason.""

""Benson, aren't you worried Sierra might get mad and refuse your proposal?""

Benson exhaled a ring of smoke, a mocking laugh escaping his lips as though he'd just heard the most ridiculous joke in the world.

""She's been dying to marry me since she was a kid, desperate to slap the name Mrs. Gray on herself. How could she possibly say no? If she wasn't obedient enough, she wouldn't even have the right to stay by my side.""

The crowd around him erupted into cheers and laughter.

""That's our Benson! Even the campus queen of Oceanea University couldn't resist his charm!""

""Benson, teach us your ways when you've got time!""

""Pfft! Step one, find yourself a woman who's head over heels for you!""

Everyone in Vellmont City knew Sierra was practically Benson's shadow. The two of them were three years apart, childhood sweethearts. Sierra had followed Benson to Oceanea City for college, giving up her plans to stay by his side.

To support him during the early days of his business, Sierra abandoned her dream of studying piano.

She took on the role of his assistant, pulling all-nighters for a month straight just to help him close a single deal. She drank so much at business dinners that she developed stomach ulcers.

Their mutual friends often said Sierra loved Benson so much that she'd lost herself completely.

But Benson? He was so convinced Sierra would never leave him that he treated her cruelly without a second thought.

In the restroom, Sierra stood frozen, her hands covering her ears. She stared at her reflection in the mirror—a woman with red-rimmed eyes and pale skin.

Slowly, she forced her lips into a smile, one that looked more painful than tears.

""Sierra, it's been ten years. Can you stop being so pathetic already?""

Chapter 2 Breaking Up

Sierra wiped away her tears, retouched her makeup, and pushed open the restroom door. When she stepped out, the first thing she saw was Benson and Sophie, arms linked, clinking glasses in a toast.

""Ha ha. Benson, if you're gonna put on a show, go all the way! Why not head to the honeymoon suite after this?""

""Man, Benson's got it all—a classy, elegant wife and a cute, flirty little assistant!""

Sierra's heart twisted painfully as her gaze fell on their intertwined arms. This was the man she had loved for ten years…

Someone caught sight of Sierra returning and nudged Benson, their voice dropping to a whisper. ""Benson, that's enough. Sierra's back.""

""Sierra, they're just joking around and trying to lighten the mood. Don't—""

But Benson didn't even let them finish before cutting in sharply. ""I'm not putting up with her tantrums!""

Then he turned to face Sierra fully, raising an eyebrow as though daring her to react. ""If you don't like what you're seeing, then leave. Stop standing there ruining my mood.""

Sierra forced herself to breathe past the stinging ache building in her nose, her eyes locking onto Benson's. ""Benson, we're breaking up.""

Her words hung in the air, slicing through the room like a blade. The chatter ceased instantly.

Did they hear her right? Sierra had just broken up with Benson?

Benson froze. Then, with an incredulous laugh, he flicked away his cigarette butt. ""You're serious? Don't come crying to me later when you change your mind and want me back.""

""Sierra, I'm so sorry. Mr. Gray was only keeping me company for my birthday because I didn't have any friends. Please don't let this affect your relationship with him.",1,1746793087.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

""but you are the king daddy"" I try to question him more, but mummy drags me out gently pulling my hand. Her big swollen belly hiding daddy from view, we go for our picnic.   
  
We ate our lunch and played in the grass and tress, at the courtyard within the palace. When daddy finally came down with uncle Marcus and some strange men. “Stay here baby” mummy says so I keep playing with baby Isaac, while mummy and daddy both talk to the men.   
  
Suddenly I hear mummy scream, and daddy is shouting. I grab baby Isaac and I look up to see a man holding something around mummy's neck, while daddy's shouting. then mummy and daddy both drop to the floor and there’s a man with a scary smile approaching Isaac and me.   
  
""Run Lyla"" daddy shouts in my direction. Daddy never uses my name, so I know this is serious. As I turn, baby Isaac is ripped from my arms. And drops to the floor completely still, I see lots of blood on him. ""Lyla run!"" daddy shouts again. the man keeps coming for me and I feel his hand on my back as I try and run away from his grip, spinning and taking off. I go through the corridors and burst outside the palace doors. All I can see is fighting and fire, the sounds of men, women and children screaming hurts my ears. Covering them I turn right and run into the woods heading south. Daddy takes me on walks all around the grounds, telling me about the land and what is in each direction. So I know the woods are thick on this side with many hiding spots.   
  
A loud growl makes me stop and turn, and a big dog jumps at me ""ahhhhh""

Boiling water pours over my skin, the steam helping my breathing slow down. Once I'm calm, I'm able to focus on the shower, cleaning my skin and long hair.

""Just what I need Rose thankyou"" I practically pounced into my chair to eat. She just smiles as she watches me swiftly empty my plate. Rose and her mate John were the alpha and Luna here. They then passed down their titles to their son Jackson on his 20th birthday, when he found his mate Samantha 10 years ago. You'd think I would hate wolves after what happened but John and Rose are different. Rose saved my life that night and carried me all the way here. She nursed me back to health and cared for me, I could never repay her for that.

But Benson didn't even let them finish before cutting in sharply. ""I'm not putting up with her tantrums!""

Then he turned to face Sierra fully, raising an eyebrow as though daring her to react. ""If you don't like what you're seeing, then leave. Stop standing there ruining my mood.""

Sierra forced herself to breathe past the stinging ache building in her nose, her eyes locking onto Benson's. ""Benson, we're breaking up.""

Her words hung in the air, slicing through the room like a blade. The chatter ceased instantly.

Did they hear her right? Sierra had just broken up with Benson?

Benson froze. Then, with an incredulous laugh, he flicked away his cigarette butt. ""You're serious? Don't come crying to me later when you change your mind and want me back.""

""Sierra, I'm so sorry. Mr. Gray was only keeping me company for my birthday because I didn't have any friends. Please don't let this affect your relationship with him.",1,1746792404.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I usually isolate during my PMDD episodes, especially the last few days before my period, mainly for my own sake because I need rest and having plans/spending time with other people makes my symptoms way worse. It really skyrocks my anxiety. I also don't enjoy anything during that time so it just feels like a waste of time and energy to make plans during that time.

Now a very old friend that lives in another part of the country, whom I wrote to a few months ago about wanting to catch up (where by she said I should come and visit her in the springtime, haven't heard from her since so I thought maybe she didn't want to/ghosted me) wrote to me yesterday asking *""Do you have any plans for next weekend?"" (May 17th)*

Well yes, being on my own, staying under the covers, eating chocolate and crying...

I want to see her but my PMDD requires me to plan things far in advance.

How do I reply? How do you handle making plans in your own life?

I don't want to lie, but at the same time I feel weird about telling people about my condition because I feel like it's impossible to understand if you haven't lived trough it yourself. I can't see anyone because I have PMS probably seems a bit weird to outsiders...

Do I just say I unfortunately have other plans? (Which leaves me worried that they will ask about the plans)

Do I say I haves some plans, what where you thinking (not sure if she means I should visit her for the weekend or if she is coming by her hometown, if she's coming by I might manage to see her, big difference between spending the weekend and grabbing a coffee for a few hours)

I just hate how hard it makes making plans with other people. Luckily I'm not that social, but I hate when it interferes with my life and how guilty it can make me feel at times.

Vet findings is that my dog is fighting an infection that is unrelated to her consuming a lot of water. Vet also said that she just wants to drink water. 

Gave meds of Prednisone, co Amoxiclab and liver boosters.

My dog had okay days and worse days.
One week later, she was not getting better and her appetite is gone. We brought her back to the vets and they did physical exam and another CBC.

CBC was mostly normal except for an elevated granulocytes.

Vet changed the medicine from co Amoxiclab to Enrofloxacin and changed the dose of the Prednisone.

“Wow, he’s back. He immediately made huge donations to the prominent art schools in the capital too. It’s great being rich, isn’t it!”  
“I’ve heard that he’s our alumni, having graduated from the Southline University. That explains his generous donations. Plus, he’s the richest man in the city after all. More importantly, he’s so charming… practically the whole nation’s ideal man - rich, handsome, and down to earth. There’s no one else like him in this world!”  
The entirety of Southline University Art Institute was engrossed with news regarding Mark Tremont’s return, except for Arianne Wynn who stood out like a sore thumb.  
Seated at the stairway, she was munching on a stale bun which had long lost its warmth. Downing the otherwise hard to swallow baked good with just plain water felt equally as cold as the winter season.  
Mark Tremont. He’s back again after three years…  
“Ari, why are you eating buns again? Come on, I’ll buy you a good meal!”  
Tiffany Lane plopped herself down carelessly beside Arianne.  
The latter shook her head before she stuffed the rest of the bun into her mouth, picking up her bag and swinging it over her shoulder. Her action emphasized her frail frame.  
“No time. I’ve got to go back.”  
Tiffany sighed. “Alright. Don’t bring any more buns tomorrow. I’ll bring you breakfast.”  
Tiffany’s voice slowly drifted afar as Arianne paddled her bicycle, finally disappearing as it flew away with the wintry breeze.  
Returning ‘home’, Arianne carefully parked her battered bicycle to the corner and slipped in through the back door. She put down her bag swiftly, returning to the small clammy storeroom.  
Just when she was about to change, Mary came in a hurry. “Ari, don’t help me out today. Sir’s looking for you… ah, and be careful. Don’t speak if you can lest he is upset, otherwise you’ll be at the receiving end again.”  
Arianne Wynn nodded and went upstairs cautiously. She patted down the washed out jacket she wore, remembering that he disliked sloppiness.  
She subconsciously held her breath whilst knocking on the door, her fingertips were trembling. She had grown a lot over the last three years, so she wondered how much would he have changed?  
“Come in.”  
A mellow voice soft like the winter sunlight spoke from within the room. If one did not pay attention, they perhaps may not realize the icy tone mixed in.  
Arianne’s heart sank a little. Pushing the door open and entering, she left it ajar on purpose.  
The man was seated facing the French window with a magazine in his hands. The expensive tailor-made suit hugged his build perfectly, adding an exquisite wash of gray to the snow-white winter day.  
Even while seated, his long legs were evident. Occasionally, his fingers with distinct joints flipped the pages gracefully. His features, flawless as if they were painstakingly sculpted, seemed dreamy under the cast of light.  
Mark Tremont, he was back after all.  
“You are turning eighteen in another half of a month?”  
His nonchalant tone bored a deep pit in Arianne’s heart.  
Not receiving her response, Mark Tremont tossed the magazine onto the coffee table beside him and turned to look at her, his deep eyes were nothing but cold.  
Arianne stepped back instinctively, convinced that she was truly the only outlier of his compassion!  
“Yes…”  
Frightened, like a deer caught in the headlights, her face was pale without a tint of blood.  
Mark Tremont walked up to her, each approaching step of his caused her to move back in fear.  
As both approached the door, Arianne almost tripped from the half-closed door. Mark was quick to step forward, closing the door with his arm as it brushed past Arianne’s ear, trapping her in-between.  
“Are you afraid of me?” His tone was taunting… seething with hate.  
Arianne Wynn dared not meet his eyes. He was much taller than her, so their close proximity could only allow her to stare straight at Mark’s chest while his aura engulfed her.Chapter 1 Grown Up",1,1746792005.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

“Let’s get a divorce.”  
  
The man, dignified yet arrogant, gazed emotionlessly at the small woman in front of him.  
  
“I’ll pay for the alimony,” he said indifferently. “If you need money, a job, or a good doctor for your mother, I’ll provide them for you.”   
  
Rose fought desperately to hold back the tears in her eyes.  
  
When Jay Ares's fiancee ran away the day before their wedding, they were forced to find a temporary substitute bride to feed the appetites of the ravenous paparazzi and media outlets.   
  
He believed that she had accepted the role to claim the title, to be known as Mrs. Ares. However, the woman, Rose, alone knew that the reason she agreed was to fulfill her two lifetimes' worth of love for him.  
  
He never knew how much she loved him.   
  
“I didn’t marry you for money,” she whispered. The intensity of her love for him had given birth to an inferiority complex.  
  
The man's deep, quiet eyes flashed a hint of skepticism.  
  
If two complete strangers got married, what reason could it be if not for money?  
  
""My patience runs thin. If there’s nothing else, I’ll arrange for my lawyer to meet you tomorrow with the divorce papers."" The man took a final sip of coffee before placing the cup on the table and turning away to head upstairs.  
  
Rose's eyes fell on the coffee cup, her timid face slowly becoming stubborn and grudging.  
  
The wind lingers, the geese leave their marks!  
  
Twice she had loved him with all her heart. She refused to give up on him that easily.  
  
Half an hour later.  
  
Upstairs.   
  
""Husband!"" Rose called out meekly, standing demurely at the door.  
  
Jay, who was fixated on a document, was taken aback at the word ""husband"", and he instinctively looked up. He stared intently at Rose.  
  
In their one year of marriage, he had forbidden her to address him as her husband. She had followed that rule obediently all this while. He was certainly not expecting an increase in boldness from her as their divorce drew near.  
  
“Yes?”  
  
“I’ll agree to the divorce,” Rose announced. “I don't want a house or any money. But I want a child.” Although she spoke softly, Jay could sense the resolution in her words.  
  
His eyes widened slightly in surprise. ‘Huh, someone’s getting bolder,’ he thought.  
  
“You and me? Never,” he spat, disgust in his voice.  
  
Rose calculated the time that had passed and the dosage she had used when she spiked his coffee. ‘The drug should kick in before long, right?’  
  
""After all, we are husband and wife,” she said. “If this whole thing is going to blow over, I feel I deserve to get something out of it!” Rose steeled her gaze and straightened her back. Her timid demeanor melted away to reveal a gritty resolve.  
  
Jay raised his eyebrows slightly. ‘Well, well, well, the little fox’s tail is finally poking out of the sheep’s skin.’  
  
""Rose, don't play hard-to-get with me. I assure you the alimony will more than satisfy you. If you're too greedy, you will end up with nothing—""  
  
""Sir Ares, I’ve told you it’s not about the money."" Rose emphasized again. She looked more determined than ever, her eyes fixed on him. “But I’ll have to borrow something from your body.”Chapter 1",1,1746791768.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1kigluz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1kigluz/rules_for_night_shift_at_casa_23/,Rules for night shift at Casa 23,"My name is Rafael, I am a newly hired nurse at Hospital São Miguel, an old building, isolated on the top of a hill. On my first day, the supervisor just said:

— You will cover the night shift at House 23. Read the instructions inside the drawer in the break room. And... follow them to the letter. Don't try to understand.

I thought it was all exaggerated. ""House 23"" was a closed section of the psychiatric hospital, rarely used. There was only one patient there: a fragile-looking woman, always silent, always staring into space. They say she was hospitalized decades ago, but never aged.

At the end of the hallway, I found the note. Handwritten, on aged paper. It seemed more like a delusion than anything else.


---

RULES FOR NIGHT DUTY – HOUSE 23

1. Never enter room 23 between 2:43 am and 3:17 am. If the patient knocks on the door during this interval, ignore it. If she screams your name, cover your ears.


2. If the lights start flashing three times in a row, go to the surveillance room and look at the cameras. Ignore anything that doesn't seem human.


3. At 4:07 am, a whisper is heard in the hallway. Don't try to identify the voice. Never responds.


4. At 4:11 am, the door to House 23 will open by itself. You must close it immediately. If someone or something is on the other side, don't maintain eye contact.


5. At 5am, the patient can call you to talk. You must listen, but never ask questions. She lies with her eyes and speaks truths with her teeth.


6. At 5:27 am, deliver the coffee with milk on the tray. Even if she doesn't eat, the tray needs to be there. If she smiles, you've already lost.


7. Never look at your reflection in the glass door. If he moves differently than you, close your eyes and step back.


8. If you survive until 6:06 am, leave the report on the counter and leave without looking back. The shift change only happens when the sun touches the blue stained glass window.




---

The first night I followed the rules. Ridiculous, I know. But something about those hallways... made my stomach turn. The patient knew my name before I said anything.

On the second night, the light blinked three times. I went to the surveillance room. On the cameras, I saw myself, standing outside the hospital, facing the entrance. But I was inside.

— You shouldn't have looked at the camera — the patient whispered that night, without moving her lips.

On the third night, I forgot to leave the coffee. When I realized it, it was already 5:45 am. I ran with the tray and left it there, shaking. When I turned around, she was smiling. With all the teeth.

I asked for a transfer. They said it was impossible. “You were accepted by her”, they told me. “Now you are the person on duty at Casa 23”.


---

If you are ever called to work at São Miguel, please: tear up this note and run away.
Because the rules are not meant to protect you.
They only help her to have fun more slowly.

Also, any parent with a kid in school could get a call from their school. Everyone has to make appointments and most jobs allow you to ask time off in advance for that. A lot of people are single parents with those exact needs, school and appointments, so I'd think there would be companies that would have accommodations for those things? I myself have appointments and unforeseen emergencies, and my regular job lets me schedule appointments and when I’ve had the rare emergency, someone covered for me. Maybe if she looked beyond what would be ""aesthetic"" or cool/fun to her, she'd find something. I honestly think she just doesn't want to work a real job and that's why vlogs are coming back that focus on the kids, her asthma, her difficult life, etc. I think she wants people to feel bad for her and fund her life because she does not want to work. And tbh I think that’s why she said years ago before kids that her dream was to be a mom without a job. As long as she can allude to the kids in the content and spin a sympathy narrative as she is known to do, she can get paid to go to coffee shops and get tattoos.

I don’t know if this is normal or if I’m just being too selfish or antisocial","I feel like I need urgent help soothing my thoughts about this. I’m 26F and moved out when I was 19 to finally live alone. For most of my childhood, I shared a bed, and a room, with my mother. We lived in a duplex house, one side belonged to my grandparents (my mom’s parents), and the other side was ours. Although we had two rooms, we never got around to furnishing the second one for me. It was either due to finances or the heating system, so I never had my own space.

My parents divorced when I was five and never spoke again. I don’t remember them together, just using me as a messenger and a battleground for venting about each other.

At 19, with some help from my dad, I moved into a tiny one-room apartment close to my university. Even though it was old and not very comfortable, I finally had full privacy. A couple of years later, with more help from my dad (and a little from my mom), I moved into a better, bigger apartment with a separate bedroom, kitchen, and living room. It wasn’t huge, but it was perfect for one person.

My mom started working seasonal jobs abroad, so she’d be away for 3 to 6 months at a time. When she returned, it was just sort of assumed I’d let her stay in my apartment, in the living room, because the duplex house I grew up in was too cold and had a bad heating system. Some years she stayed a few months, some much more, some less. It was always unpredictable.

At first, it felt okay. Sometimes we really cooperated well, helping each other with little things, making life easier. But over time, our relationship would deteriorate. We'd start clashing over the smallest things, like me waking up at 5 a.m. to work on my business and thus waking her up by simply moving through aparatment to get coffee, or her yelling on the phone with her long-distance partner at midnight. Why should I hear their jealousy-fueled fights? Why couldn’t she just go outside for her hour-long calls?

Recently, we had two major arguments. One was again about her late-night phone drama. She made it into a huge scene, saying, *“You don’t want me here. I’m a burden,”* even though I never said that. I just asked for basic respect, like keeping the noise down at night by either not talking to him that late or getting outside of the apartment, that I'd rather by woken up by her getting out of apartment instead of by her speaking on the phone.

The second argument was worse, too painful to even write about. It started over something stupid on a short trip, but it blew up.

So here’s my question:  
Is it normal to not want my mother living with me unpredictably for 3 or 6 months a year, especially now that I’m 26? Would it be cruel or selfish when she is in our city to let her to go back to the duplex house, where her dog is and where my grandparents (her parents) still live?

It’s so confusing, because sometimes things feel good between us. But then, just as quickly, the cons outweigh the pros. I feel like a bad person for wanting space. I know I’d sometimes miss her. But when I lived alone for those two years, our relationship actually improved. Now that she’s stayed with me again, it’s a constant push-pull.

Sometimes her chaotic energy, going to bed at 1 a.m., being disorganized, always saying, *“I’m forgetting things,”* or *“I’m not well,”* drains me. It’s like it bleeds into my own energy. Yet, I beat myself up for feeling that way. I’ve had success in my business both with and without her around. But what if her sadness or sense of disorientation is affecting me more than I realize?

Does wanting my own space make me selfish or too antisocial for wanting to live all the months in a year fully alone? Am I weak for needing solitude to be fully focused?  
She recently said during the most hurful fight we've had, *“I see that I’ve become too nervous or hurtful toward you, and I don’t want that to continue, so I’ll distance myself to make sure these kind of things never happen again because sometimes I'm just like that when I loose my nerves”* And it’s painful to hear. It's painful to say anything really. Sometimes it just feels like I'm loosing my mind because I feel like it's possible to still make it work, but like is it fully worth it. It also makes me want to do so much better in my business to be able to pay her for separate apartment but maybe even then she would project on me that that truly means I don't like her as a person because money in her eyes is so serious and if I had I would easily pay that for her to have her full privacy and comfort, yet there is also a fear of making her too codependent. Maybe something resolves over time so neither of these choices need to be chosen..but still

There are so many nuances I could add… I just hope someone understands this.

**TL;DR:**  
I’m 26F. After years of sharing a room with my mom, I finally got to live alone, and loved it. But my mom now stays with me several unpredictable months per year, and it's affecting our relationship, sometimes my mental space, and my motivation. Is it wrong or selfish to ask for my space back or let her to there, even if not fully comfortable place to go, yet my grandparents are living there?

I don’t know if this is normal or if I’m just being too selfish or antisocial","I feel like I need urgent help soothing my thoughts about this. I’m 26F and moved out when I was 19 to finally live alone. For most of my childhood, I shared a bed, and a room, with my mother. We lived in a duplex house, one side belonged to my grandparents (my mom’s parents), and the other side was ours. Although we had two rooms, we never got around to furnishing the second one for me. It was either due to finances or the heating system, so I never had my own space.

My parents divorced when I was five and never spoke again. I don’t remember them together, just using me as a messenger and a battleground for venting about each other.

At 19, with some help from my dad, I moved into a tiny one-room apartment close to my university. Even though it was old and not very comfortable, I finally had full privacy. A couple of years later, with more help from my dad (and a little from my mom), I moved into a better, bigger apartment with a separate bedroom, kitchen, and living room. It wasn’t huge, but it was perfect for one person.

My mom started working seasonal jobs abroad, so she’d be away for 3 to 6 months at a time. When she returned, it was just sort of assumed I’d let her stay in my apartment, in the living room, because the duplex house I grew up in was too cold and had a bad heating system. Some years she stayed a few months, some much more, some less. It was always unpredictable.

At first, it felt okay. Sometimes we really cooperated well, helping each other with little things, making life easier. But over time, our relationship would deteriorate. We'd start clashing over the smallest things, like me waking up at 5 a.m. to work on my business and thus waking her up by simply moving through aparatment to get coffee, or her yelling on the phone with her long-distance partner at midnight. Why should I hear their jealousy-fueled fights? Why couldn’t she just go outside for her hour-long calls?

Recently, we had two major arguments. One was again about her late-night phone drama. She made it into a huge scene, saying, *“You don’t want me here. I’m a burden,”* even though I never said that. I just asked for basic respect, like keeping the noise down at night by either not talking to him that late or getting outside of the apartment, that I'd rather by woken up by her getting out of apartment instead of by her speaking on the phone.

The second argument was worse, too painful to even write about. It started over something stupid on a short trip, but it blew up.

So here’s my question:  
Is it normal to not want my mother living with me unpredictably for 3 or 6 months a year, especially now that I’m 26? Would it be cruel or selfish when she is in our city to let her to go back to the duplex house, where her dog is and where my grandparents (her parents) still live?

It’s so confusing, because sometimes things feel good between us. But then, just as quickly, the cons outweigh the pros. I feel like a bad person for wanting space. I know I’d sometimes miss her. But when I lived alone for those two years, our relationship actually improved. Now that she’s stayed with me again, it’s a constant push-pull.

Sometimes her chaotic energy, going to bed at 1 a.m., being disorganized, always saying, *“I’m forgetting things,”* or *“I’m not well,”* drains me. It’s like it bleeds into my own energy. Yet, I beat myself up for feeling that way. I’ve had success in my business both with and without her around. But what if her sadness or sense of disorientation is affecting me more than I realize?

Does wanting my own space make me selfish or too antisocial for wanting to live all the months in a year fully alone? Am I weak for needing solitude to be fully focused?  
She recently said during the most hurful fight we've had, *“I see that I’ve become too nervous or hurtful toward you, and I don’t want that to continue, so I’ll distance myself to make sure these kind of things never happen again because sometimes I'm just like that when I loose my nerves”* And it’s painful to hear. It's painful to say anything really. Sometimes it just feels like I'm loosing my mind because I feel like it's possible to still make it work, but like is it fully worth it. It also makes me want to do so much better in my business to be able to pay her for separate apartment but maybe even then she would project on me that that truly means I don't like her as a person because money in her eyes is so serious and if I had I would easily pay that for her to have her full privacy and comfort, yet there is also a fear of making her too codependent. Maybe something resolves over time so neither of these choices need to be chosen..but still

There are so many nuances I could add… I just hope someone understands this.

**TL;DR:**  
I’m 26F. After years of sharing a room with my mom, I finally got to live alone, and loved it. But my mom now stays with me several unpredictable months per year, and it's affecting our relationship, sometimes my mental space, and my motivation. Is it wrong or selfish to ask for my space back or let her to there, even if not fully comfortable place to go, yet my grandparents are living there?

Blood.

It was everywhere.

In her hands, in between her toes, in her hair. It was everywhere! Why… Whose blood is this? And why was she standing in it? Why was she f\*\*\*\*\*g covered in it?!

And all of a sudden, the scene changes and her family is here, covered in their own blood, getting killed.

“No,” Calista screamed, reaching out for them but the floor vanished from under her and she was falling… falling…

Calista woke up with a start, her heart pounding hard against her rib, every single inch of her body covered in sweat. Her room was silent, the only sound was her harsh breathing.

She blinked slowly, her eyes taking time to adjust to the darkness before she looked over at her clock. It was barely five and she was now awake.

She knew she wouldn't be going back to sleep.

She sighed deeply as she rubbed her trembling hand on her face, pushing her wet hair away.

It was going to be a long day.

\*\*\*

The bright overhead lights buzzed faintly, casting a harsh glare on the blood-soaked sheets beneath her hands. The smell of antiseptic mixed with the thick, metallic scent of freshly spilled blood was heavy on the nose—so much blood.

Her mind flashed back to a different scene with so much blood, screams. But she blinked that away. This wasn't the time to be thinking about that. She needed her hands straight, her head clear.

Calista’s hands were steady but her heart was hammering hard in her chest. She barely noticed the surgical mask pressing against her nose or the sweat gathering beneath the gloves clinging to her skin.

“He’s crashing!” someone yelled, panic heavy in their voice.

She ignored the panic in their voice, focusing instead on the deep, gaping wound in the man’s abdomen. The bullet wound had torn through muscle and lodged itself dangerously close to his liver. If she didn't get it out he was as good as dead.

“Scalpel,” she ordered, her voice calm, even though she also wanted to panic. But she couldn't. The man’s life depended on her remaining calm.

A trembling hand passed it to her. She wanted to scowl at them. She didn't have the damn time for fear.

Her movements were quick, memorized, and precise. A small incision. A delicate probe. There! The bullet. Her breath hitched. It was deeper than she expected, wedged tight, but she couldn't hesitate. Not now. Carefully, she reached in with a forceps—

Bang!

The doors to the operating room open.

Calista’s head snapped up, a sharp reprimand on her tongue, but the words died on her tongue when she saw them—men in black suits, guns at their sides, their eyes cold and empty.

Her heart dropped to her stomach.

What the hell?

The men parted and one man with blonde hair stepped forward, his hard eyes fixed on Caliste. He had that air of anger around him, the quiet hum of danger surrounding him like a dark cloud, a black omen. “Miss Calloway,” he addressed her, his voice smooth. “Do you know who you're operating on?”

Calista has always been quick to anger, always quick to snap. It was one of her many flaws, one of the things that made her a loner and bitter. Because people were so damn annoying, and nosy, and she was quick to lash out. And now she was damn close to snapping but she kept her mouth shut and glared at the man, her heart racing.

“I wouldn't bother with names,” the man continued, his expression blank. “All you have to know is that you shouldn't let him die.”

Calista wanted to throw her head back and laugh, and she also wanted to stab the man with the forceps still in her hand. Who the hell were these people?

“Do you think threatening me is going to make him miraculously live if he's meant to die?” she snapped, her voice muffled by the nose mask, but that didn't dull the sharpness in her voice.

She was scared. Goddamn it, she was f\*\*\*\*\*g scared and she fought to keep her hand steady. But she was also angry. And the anger suppressed the fear. It was better rage than fear.

The man’s eyes flashed with something dangerous before it cleared and he opened his mouth to probably spit more threats but Calista didn't give him the chance.

“You’re the one currently endangering his life, mister,” she told him, trying to keep her voice calm, but she didn't stop glaring at him. “With every minute you spend here, throwing unnecessary threats, you're delaying me and his life is being more at risk. Get out.”

The man eyed her, his jaw clenched tight, before he made a motion with two of his fingers and the men cleared out just as suddenly as they came, the man’s eyes lingering on her far too long for her taste.

Once the door closed behind them, the room seemed to release the breath they'd been holding and Calista’s hands shook a little, regret twisting her insides.

She should have kept her mouth shut, for goodness sake. Why did her mouth always have to go running before her brain? These people were bad news. She knew this wouldn't be the end.

She looked down at her patient’s face, searching her brain to see if she would know him. She didn't. He had an unforgettable face, so she knew she wouldn't have seen him before.

She didn't care about who he was. She just hoped this was the last time she would see his face.

\*\*\*

A WEEK LATER

Calista sighed as she stepped into her apartment, inhaling the warm and inviting smell of her home.

“Hi, baby,” she said to her house. “Missed me? Because I sure as hell missed you.”

Talking to herself or objects around her was one habit she had never outgrown. Well, that and her deep pit of rage. That rage had been with her for as long as she could remember. And it only increased when her–

She immediately felt something was wrong when she stepped deeper into her apartment. The hair at the back of her neck stood up, a chill sense of dread wrapped its icy fingers around her spine.

She felt eyes on her.

Her trembling hand reached for the light switch and she turned it on. Her heart dropped to her toes when she saw who was sitting in her living room, legs crossed as if he owned the place.

She knew it. She goddamn knew that wouldn't be the last time she saw his face.

He stood up, straightening to his full height until he was towering over her and she felt tiny.

“Hello, Miss Calloway.”

# Dislike For The Doctor

SIX DAYS AGO

“The Russian has been quiet,” Aaron informed Jaxon, sitting on the chair close to the hospital bed, his leg crossed and a tablet in front of his nose. “We haven't heard a single thing from them since that night.”

Jaxon hummed but said nothing. He was trying to pay attention to what Aaron was saying and he was failing. He should be listening, only that he felt… irritated.

He was sick of just sitting in a hospital bed all day and simply doing nothing. He couldn't even stand up and pace around the room, for God’s sake.

Aaron was always quick to tell him when he complained that he almost died. “The doctor said you need a lot of rest. So stay down, Jaxon, and f\*\*\*\*\*g rest.”

Jaxon was close to throwing a tantrum like a f\*\*\*\*\*g child.

His muscles were stiff and aching. He needed to be up and moving around, not sitting still while everyone did everything for him. There was a war going on and he should be at the front.

And even though Aaron told him the Russians were lying low, he still couldn't relax.

“Are you listening to me, Jaxon?” Aaron asked, a hint of irritation in his voice.

“No,” Jaxon answered curtly and looked at the TV, even though he wasn't seeing anything.

He ignored Aaron’s heavy sigh and just fell back into his head, lost in the depth of his mind, that was until the door opened, and his world stepped into the room.

“Hermano,” she cried as she ran to him, and he opened his arms for her. She hugged him tightly, and he winced from the pain that shot through his abdomen, but he didn't release his hold on her.

“Mi amor,” he whispered, holding her tightly and burying his nose in her hair, inhaling her soothing scent.

“You.” She pulled away from him, sniffing as she hit him in the chest. “What were you thinking? Getting shot?”

His lips curled into a soft smile, a smile only meant for her. “Forgive me, mi amor. I shall tell the Russians next time not to shoot me. That I have a little sister that might die if I die.”

“Damn right.” She glared at him for a short moment before she hugged him again. “I was so scared,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I was so, so scared when Aaron told me.”

Jaxon shot Aaron a look behind Aelina’s shoulder, and the bastard shrugged, his eyes falling back to his tablet. Jaxon was going to have a word with him later.

“You shouldn't be,” he said softly as he stroked her hair. “Death wouldn't be able to take me away from you.”

She was his life, his goddamn everything.

They weren't related in any way. Not at all. But she was still his family.

He had found her on the streets, fifteen years ago, tiny and starving. But despite how she looked, there was still a fire in her eyes, a fire that never burned out through out. He had been young himself, then, but he carried her in his arms, and she had been the bane of his existence since then.

Aelina pulled away from him and immediately lunged into talks of school. Jaxon listened intently, nodding, and saying a word or two. Aaron got up and left, saying he was going to get lunch.

Ten minutes later, he came back with his eyebrows set, and no lunch.

“What is it?” Jaxon asked, immediately tensed, alert.

Aaron sat back on his chair, crossing his arms, looking Jaxon dead in the eyes as he said, “I don't like your doctor.”

Jaxon blinked at him, his eyebrows furrowed. “Why?”

“She’s disrespectful.”

Aelina rolled her eyes at him. “Let me guess, she didn't cower at your mighty presence?”

Aaron shot her a glance but said nothing.

Jaxon groaned. “That's why you're sulking?”

Aaron gave him a look that could make his balls wither and die. “I am not sulking.”

“Sure,” Aelina said. “You’re only pouting.”

Aaron stuck out his tongue at her.

A short laugh burst from Jaxon. Aaron was his commander. He ruled their empire when Jaxon wasn't there. He was feared, respected, and could be brutal when he wanted. And he could also be cute when he wanted. Though he might probably stab Jaxon in the balls if he called him cute.

“Anyways, dislike aside,” Aaron said, his expression now serious, “I think she's the one we’re looking for.”

Jaxon raised an eyebrow.

“A doctor,” Aaron answered the unasked question.

“Ahh.” Jaxon nodded.

They needed a doctor in their outfit. Someone they could trust, someone they could let into their circle. Someone who could treat them on the call and ready. Jaxon being at this hospital had raised too many eyebrows. He didn't want the public’s eyes on him.

That attention wouldn't have happened if they had their own doctor. They had one but he was killed. This war with the Russians had taken too much. From both sides.

In this last fight with them, Jaxon and his men were able to take a lot of them down before they managed to put a bullet in him. So they were probably regrouping, licking their wounds while they prepared for the next fight.

Jaxon wanted to hit them now that they were weak, but he had also taken a big blow to his side.

Back to the doctor…

“Why do you think she could do it?” Jaxon asked Aaron. “Our world isn't for just anyone, Aaron. You can't just see someone and decide they were fit for a life of blood and violence. That is not how things are done.” Aelina nodded as he spoke, sitting beside him on the bed and interlocking their fingers.

Their last doctor was born into their world, he knew everything about it and how to survive in it. Their world wasn't for the faint-hearted. It was cruel and brutal. That was why he tried as hard as possible to keep Aelina shielded from it all.

Since he took her under his wing, she has never stayed in Spain for more than a month. He spent her off to England, where she would be safe and could study.

A life with him was dangerous. That was why he never took lovers. Despite how much he craved…

“I know she can be our next doctor,” Aaron answered, his jaw set in determination. “It's all in her eyes, Jaxon. She has seen things, been through hell and back. She's tough. Back at the operation room, she looked me dead in the eyes and told me to get out.”

Jaxon still didn't understand why Aaron would burst into the operating room and threaten the doctor. He had defended himself by saying, “She could be working with those bastard Russians. So I had to go remind her what would happen if she tried to mess with you. That is if she was working with the Russians.”

That had made sense, but still.

“She’s got steel, Jaxon,” Aaron continued. “I know it.”

Jaxon was silent for a while, thinking about it. If his commander said she could do it, then she could.

“I assume you already have her file?”

Aaron smiled as he handed him his tablet. “Of course I do.”

# The Past Was In The Past

Calista stared at the man, her heart racing, her eyes still wide. She was supposed to be panicking, screaming, demanding what the hell he was doing at her house, but her mind was taking time to get there, to realize it was in danger, sluggish with shock.

It would catch up. It always did. It just needed a push.

“Miss Calloway,” the stranger called again, and this time he took a step towards her.

And that was the push her mind needed. The fear slammed into her all at once.

She took a step back, her hands trembling. “Don’t… don't… Who are you? What are you doing in my house? Get out!”

She kept taking a step back, walking towards the door without alerting him. She just needed to leave here, then she would run as fast as her legs could carry her, and she would call the police. But a little voice at the back of her head told her this man wouldn't be threatened by the police, that the police were probably in his pocket.

She told that voice to shut the hell up.

The man raised his hands in the universal gesture of surrender, his expression calm, much to Calista distaste. “I apologize for intruding into your home like this,” he said, his voice deep, and oddly… soothing. No, Calista, nothing was soothing about this intruder’s voice. “I just wanted to talk.”

She narrowed her eyes, her back hitting the door, her fingers scrambling for the handle. Locked. Damn it, the door was locked!

Oh God. No. No, no, no–

“Why couldn't you book an appointment or call as a normal person would?” she snapped, her voice cracking.

The corner of his lips lifted in a smile, his hands still up. “I'm not a normal person.”

Her heart beat harder against her chest. She told herself it was from fear, not because of his damn smile. “Damn right you're not.”

She knew what kind of person he was, what he did. The men in black? A bullet wound? It was so obvious. This time Calista’s heart was racing fast from fear. She knew what he did, she knew he was from the mafia. Maybe a leader. From the way he spoke, stood, that air of power around him. It was all so damn obvious.

She wanted nothing to do with these people. They were part of a life she had buried so deep, she barely remembered it—except in her nightmares. But now, those nightmares were slipping into reality.

Oh, now she was finally panicking.

She threw her bag on the floor, turned to the door, and unlocked it, her hands trembling badly, it was a struggle before she finally got the door open.

She was weak in the knees, fear making her dizzy, but she forced her body to run, she forced her voice to scream for help. “Help!” Louder, Calista. Scream louder.

She ran through her apartment building, screaming, tears streaming down her face.

Her past was in the past. It should stay there.

Her bare feet pounded against the hallway floor. Doors creaked open. Faces peered out, confused and startled. A tall, big man she had seen once or twice came out and she ran straight to him.

“Pl-please, help me,” she cried, holding the man’s hand in her trembling one.

The man looked at her with worried eyes, letting her hold his hand. “What's wrong?”

“There-” She inhaled to get herself together. “There is a man in my apartment. A stranger. Please help me.”

The man’s expression darkened. He carefully peeled Calista’s hand from his and went inside his apartment. Calista swayed, dizzy with panic. Oh God, he left. He wasn't going to–

Then he came back. Holding a knife. A big one. He jerked his head towards her apartment. “Come on.”

Calista sniffed as she led him towards her apartment, staying glued to his side. They got to her apartment. Her door was still wide open, the contents of her bag still sprawled on the floor. And the man? Gone. No one was in her apartment.

“There’s no one here,” the man informed her after he searched everywhere.

She inhaled a shaky breath, her shoulders shaking with it as she leaned against the wall, rubbing her hand aggressively on her face.

“Do you need me to call the police?” the neighbor asked gently, standing a small distance away from her.

She should. But it was useless.

The police wouldn't help. Because men like him didn't fear the law.

She raised her head and managed a strained smile. “No… no, thank you. I'll call them. Maybe.”

That was a lie, of course.

She thanked the man and he left, but she didn't just stay there and wait for the stranger to come back. She picked up her phone, her purse, and her car keys. There was no way in hell she was staying here.

\*\*\*

Calista stayed in a hotel for two nights. She didn't even go back to her apartment for a change of clothes. She bought the clothes she was wearing.

She was scared beyond relief. God, she was so scared. What did the stranger want from her? Did he want to punish her for speaking to that man in the operating room rudely? Did he want to threaten her?

Or… God, or did he know who she was?

A violent shiver passed through her as she stepped inside her office, closing the door behind her.

Had she… had she slipped and given herself away? She… she couldn't. She was careful. So damn careful.

She sat down behind her desk, dropping her bag. She picked up her coffee and drank it down in one go. She still felt like s\*\*t.

Thank goodness she didn't have any operations for this week. Goodness knows what she might do during the operation.

A gentle knock came at her door and Cynthia opened the door and stepped inside, a small smile on her face.

“Dr. Calloway, your patient is here to see you,” Cynthia informed her.

“My patient?” Calista asked, a confused look on her face.

Cynthia nodded. “Mr. Jaxon Castillo booked an apartment with you yesterday. You approved of it, ma'am.”

She had? And who was Jaxon Castillo? Calista didn't always remember the names of her patients. What? There were a lot. Her brain might melt if she starts trying to remember their names.

And she didn't want to ask Cynthia who that was. Cynthia was already giving her that ‘look.’ That look that says she knew something was going on with Calista and she was beginning to worry. Calista hated that look.

Cynthia might be her assistant but Calista still liked to keep her life private, tight lid, that not even air could enter. She might have been working in this hospital for five years, but no one knew anything about her. That was how Calista liked to live.

So she gave Cynthia a tight smile as she said, “I’ll see him now.”

Cynthia nodded and left.

Calista sighed, slumping back on her chair and pressing her index finger against her temple. She was tired, physically and mentally. She needed a break.

Maybe she could take a week off. Since the five years she started working she could count the number of times she had taken leave on one hand.

Yes, you could call her a work freak.

Work was the glue keeping her together. And it felt like some kind of link to her father. He had wanted to be a doctor, but the life he was born into didn't allow that. But she could. So she was doing this for her father.

A knock came at her door and Calista was immediately on her feet, slapping her fake smile on to greet her patient.

But that smile turned sour when she saw who it was.

# Choices And Consequences

Oh no. Oh no, no, no–

He was here again.

He was goddamn here again!

This time Calista’s brain didn't need any push to go into a panic mood. The panic was instant, crushing. She opened her mouth to scream for Cynthia but the man–Jaxon spoke before her.

“Calm down, Miss Calloway,” he said calmly, but unlike that night, there was an edge to his voice. “You asked me to book an appointment like a normal person and here I am. I won't harm you in your office, where anyone could just enter. That will be stupid.”

True. That was true. Calista’s panicked brain just needed to understand that. He couldn't hurt her. Yeah. He couldn't.

Her breathing slowed, and the tension in her body ever so slowly started to melt away. But she didn't sit. She didn't relax. She remained standing, watching like a prey watching its predator.

“Would you mind if I sit?” he asked gently, gesturing towards the chair in front of her desk.

It was better than standing. He was intimidating when he was standing, tall, and packed with muscles, he was the definition of a predator. “By all means.” She pointed at the chair.

He sat down slowly, adjusting his suit, and giving her a small smile. He looked up at her while she looked down her nose, but that changed nothing about who held the power. Even sitting, he still looked like a crime god.

With his three-piece suit, tailored to perfection to match him like a second skin, his jet black perfectly styled back and some falling into his eyes, and his eyes—those damn eyes—black, like a void, yet they were… soft. Soft, not hard, and empty like how it was supposed to be.

His eyes made him look… kind. But Calista wouldn't be fooled by looks. It has long since been established that looks could be madly deceiving. So she wasn't falling for his eyes, even as they continued to stare at her in that not-so-uncomfortable way he was doing now.

“I want to apologize for that night,” he began, his deep voice soft. “I shouldn't have just entered your home uninvited. I should have approached you like how a normal person would. And for that, I’m sorry. Deeply. I'm embarrassed by my actions.”

And he did look embarrassed. There was a slight pink color in his eyes, barely noticeable in his tanned skin, but it was there, alright.

Calista slowly sat down, her eyes never leaving his. His eyes brightened as he watched her relax. Goodness, was she wrong about him? Wasn't he a part of the mafia? He had the looks, had the aura, but… those black, bottomless eyes. They were so expressive. You could see his soul through them.

She inhaled as she looked into his eyes and said, “Now that we've passed the point of you trying to kill me with a heart attack, what do you want from me, Mr. Castillo?”

Castillo’s smile didn't waver. If anything, it only sharpened, a flicker of something amused—pleased—crossing his features.

“Straight to the point,” he murmured. “I admire that.”

He leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk between them. It was subtle, but the movement shifted the air, shrinking the space between them, forcing her to remain right there, under his unwavering gaze.

“I need a doctor, Miss Calloway,” he said.

Calista blinked. “A doctor?”

“You,” he clarified softly. “Your skills. Your hands.”

Something in his voice made her chest tighten. It wasn't a request—it was a decision he already made.

Calista straightens, fighting the urge to recoil. “I work at a hospital, as you already know, Mr. Castillo. If you need medical attention, there are plenty of places you can go to.”

A quiet sigh left him, as if he expected her to say that. “You misunderstand,” he murmured. “I can't go to the hospital. My people can't. My men brought me here because they had no other chance.”

Calista’s fingers curled slightly on her desk. “Why?”

She already knew why. But he didn't need to know that she knew. The less he knew about the things she knew, the better.

He studied her for a moment, his gaze steady. Then, finally, he spoke, his voice as smooth as velvet, “Because I am at war, Miss Calloway.”

Thump.

Thump.

Thump.

She tried to maintain that steady beat of her heart, she tried to school her expression to remain calm.

“War?” The word left a foul taste in her mouth.

He nodded, slow and deliberate. “It's not something you need to bother yourself with. But what you need to know is this—I have men who are hurt, men who will continue to get hurt. And I need someone I can trust to take care of them. Taking them to the hospital will attract attention we do not need.”

Trust. Coming from a man she had only just met. Coming from a don. Since when did dons trust anyone but themselves?

Calista wet her dry lips and Castillo’s eyes dropped to them before he looked back at her eyes sharply. “You trust me?” she asked, skeptical lacing her voice.

“No,” he answered honestly without missing a beat. “But I'm willing to trust you.”

Calista inhaled sharply, suddenly dizzy.

Trust. Trust. Trust.

That word was dangerous, a double-edged sword. It could be the best thing when someone trusts you, and it could be the worst thing ever. Knowing you had someone to trust was comforting, and it also hurt more than anything when that trust was broken.

She had never experienced something like that before, but her father had. He had someone break his trust so badly, it had left him broken. It had left all of them broken. And dead. Her family died in the flesh, while she was dead on the inside.

Calista blinked, her eyes going wide when she felt tears on her lashes. She was on the verge of tears and Castillo was watching her, his eyes slightly narrowed. She turned away from him, blinking rapidly, clearing her throat.

“I'm not sure I'm the first person for this,” she said and cleared her throat again when her voice came out hoarse.

Castillo smiled gently. “You are.”

“How do you know?”

His eyes softened. “It's all in your eyes, Calista.”

Calista didn't know what he meant by that, and she didn't want to know. But what she wanted to know was why the sound of her name on his lips, the way he said each syllabus with such care, made something in her chest tighten.

“I don't want to force you into anything, Miss Calloway,” Castillo said after a moment, his voice gentle, careful. “I simply want you to consider it.”

That was almost worse than an outright demand. Because now, the choice—and the consequences—were her decision to make. And they have already established—they, as in the demons in her head—that she was terrible at making decisions.

And something tells her if she said no—truly refused—he wouldn't push. He wouldn't threaten. He would simply leave.

She met his gaze one last time, not even bothering with a fake smile. “Have a nice day, Mr. Castillo.”

There. She made a decision. And in record time also.

# Blood Stain Everywhere

THREE DAYS LATER

Drip.

Drip.

Drip.

Calista watched as each drop of water from the tap fell into the sink, its drip sound a dull resonance in her mind.

The numbness was spreading, but it wasn't fast enough for her. A tingling sensation still buzzed within her skin, her ears were ringing, and her heart was beating mercilessly against its cage.

Drip.

Drip.

Drip.

Will it ever get easier? Will the pain ever be dull to handle? Would she always feel this sensation under her skin whenever she operated on someone?

God, she couldn't.

She would go crazy. She would peel her own skin off just to be rid of that buzzing. She would rip her own heart out just so she couldn't feel again.

She hadn't been able to save a life today. A girl that had so much life in front of her. But that life has slipped past Calista’s fingers today. She could do nothing but watch as the girl's heart stopped beating. She could do nothing when the girl's mother flung herself to the ground and wept.

She could still hear the woman screaming and begging them to tell her it was a lie and that her daughter was still alive.

Calista had been tempted to tell her just so she could stop hearing the woman's cries.

But that would be cruel, and Calista was not cruel, no matter how she wished she was. Because if she was cruel, then she wouldn't feel like this. She wouldn't feel like she was falling apart, only hanging by a thin thread just because she couldn't save a life today.

She was no god. She tried to save people from what she knew, it wasn't her fault if they died. She shouldn't blame herself so much. But yet she does.

The brown eyes at the mirror turned glassy, then a tear slipped through, then another.

Goddamn it!

Why wasn't she numb yet? Why was she still feeling? She… she didn't want to feel. Goddamn it, she didn't want to feel. Because she might go crazy, or she might be eaten alive by feelings.

Calista felt everything to an extreme. That was her blessing and that was her curse. When she was happy, she was happy to the fullest. When she was angry, sad…

Her hands that were placed on top of the sink shook, her eyes in the mirror turning red. She closed her eyes because she couldn't bear the haunted look in those eyes.

She couldn't.

She bit her tongue to keep the sobs that wanted to burst out in. It wasn't her fault.

“It wasn't my fault,” she whispered out loud as if it would convince her heart, her head. Her voice was hoarse, broken. And the sob almost burst out but she hit her tongue harder, tasting iron.

The pain seemed to ground her and the fog behind her eyelids began to clear.

It wasn't her fault.

\*\*\*

Calista decided to walk home. She had gone back to her house since that day with Jaxon. She knew he would leave her alone. And truly, he did. She hasn't seen him since that day. She didn't know why that made her heart heavy with disappointment when she had refused his offer.

She wanted to see those eyes, those very expressive eyes. But she wouldn't, because she being close to him meant she would be close to his life. She wouldn't want to touch that with a fifty-foot-long pole.

She sighed, her legs suddenly too heavy.

She could still hear the mother’s scream. In the silence that followed after the heart monitor flatline.

She wanted to reach home where she would curl up in her bed then sleep, or maybe cry. Crying will be–

Calista froze on her steps.

Something was terribly, terribly wrong.

The streets were too quiet. Even though it was late, it shouldn't be this quiet. Calista has walked this road countless times and this was the first time the street has been too… still.

Her pulse quickened as unease curled around her ribs, the hair at the back of her neck standing on end.

Oh, something was definitely wrong.

She was just readying herself to run when a sharp sound cut through the air. Gunshots.

Every single cell in Calista’s blood shut down and she went completely still, and a sweat broke out on her body even though the evening air was cool. She wasn't even breathing. She was.. She was having a panic attack. But unlike the other people who screamed and sobbed when they had panic attacks, Calista just stood still, her breath a harsh panting.

The gunshots went off again and this time, shouts followed. Calista flinched, finally snapping out of her stillness, but she still didn't move, couldn't run.

Blood.

Oh God, there was blood everywhere. Her white gown was stained with it. It was on her hands, everywhere. A strangled sob burst out of her as she tried to remove the blood from her hands.

“It wouldn't come off.” Her voice sounded rough and it sounded like she was talking underwater. “It won’t come off!”

She heard screams and she flinched, her entire body feeling like electricity was passing through it.

Screams.

Screams.

Screams.

She blinked–

Her father, kneeling, blood dripping down his temple. Her siblings, their tiny hands clawing at the men holding them. A gun. Pressed cold to her father’s head.

Calista screamed, lunging for her family but strong hands held her back.

She screamed and fought against them, trying to get to her family. She had to… She… She had…

They were going to die and she was going to watch. She couldn't. It was better to die with them.

She fought harder but the hands around her didn't relent.

“Calista!”

She fought harder, thrashing, screaming, acting like a woman possessed. She had to get to them. She wanted to die with them.

“Calista, snap out of it!”

“No!” she screamed back. “Let me go!”

“Calista, it's Jaxon!”

Huh? Jaxon? How…

She blinked the tears away in her eyes and the streets came back into focus. She looked down at her gown and there… there was no blood. She trembled, a sob bursting out of her, loud and ugly.

She thought she was getting better. She thought she had been healing. But she just kept relapsing. Her stupid therapist had told her she needed time, but how much time did she need? It has been ten years, goddamn it!

She cursed Felicia whenever she was for giving her false hope that she would heal.

“Hey,” a voice said calmly behind her and she froze. That was when she realized that there were hands around her and her back was pressed against a hard chest. “It's Jaxon,” the voice whispered, releasing her gently.

She staggered forward when he released her, and Jaxon was there to steady her.

She blinked up at him, and her eyes landed on black eyes. It was really him.

“Jaxon?” Her voice sounded hoarse like she had been screaming.

Right.

She had.

“We need to get out of here,” Jaxon said softly, but his features were hard.

“What's–” Her words were lost as another gunshot went off.",1,1746791615.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1kigkhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kigkhr/could_you_share_your_advice_on_my_career_choice/,Could you share your advice on my career choice?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 34M expat living in France.

I’ve been working as a project manager in IT in Paris for almost 4 years (6 month internship at another company included).

To give you a bit of context about my background: I worked in education as an operations manager for three years in my home country before moving to France. I moved here to pursue a master’s degree and eventually landed a mid-senior position, which required around three years of experience. So, on paper, I have over six years of professional experience.

The company I worked for (about 200 employees. not very big) was acquired by a larger company with nearly 3,000 employees. I transitioned into a bigger team, but the issue is that I was placed 1–2 levels below the senior colleagues I work closely with despite having the same impact, simply because I hadn’t been at the company as long as they had.

I was recently promoted to senior project manage, but the raise was only 8%, which surprised me especially since I had clearly communicated my concerns and how much raise the impact of my job deserved during my performance review. My colleagues who were also promoted still earn 10\~15% more than I do. I felt betrayed, particularly because my manager had said he would help to get me where I needed to be.

He’s generally pleasant to work with (he’s been around for over 20 years) but he tends to make things sound pleasantly hopeful when there’s little to no chance they will happen. Anyway, during the call about the promotion result, he goes *“I know this raise doesn’t meet your needs, but there were also others that needed support and I had to be fair. I know the company has a reputation for low pay, but this is the best I can do. If you decide to look elsewhere, I’d understand.”*

Currently, my pay is 10\~20% below the industry standard in the French market. I began looking for a new role a few weeks ago and have had some interviews, but the opportunities that match my expectations in terms of role and salary are located 1.5\~2 hours away.

While I enjoy the work I do and the environment here, it feels like there’s no realistic path for growth, no matter the impact I make, due to the company’s rigid and toxic hierarchy.

Curious to hear your thoughts on my situation. Feel free to share your own experiences too. Your input would mean a lot to me!

Btw, let me know if you are based in Paris. Let's meet up for coffee or something!",1,1746791528.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

**AUGUST 12**

I step out of the shop and I see something that terrifies me.  Connis is kneeling in front of her tree.  She is looking up at a red X on her tree.  I see the anguish on her face and it matches the fear in the pit of my stomach.

I walk up and she looks at me with tear-stained eyes.  I can feel the desire to beg me for help fighting her natural aversion to owing me for something like this.  I literally could not care less about her owing me in this moment. 

“When were they here?”  She looks at me and I see hope.  “10 minutes ago.”

I nod and look around, I spot the city truck down the block and start walking.  I get to the area and hear a few wolf whistles.  Guys wearing hard hats in New York have some commonalities.  I am in a pencil skirt.  The legs are going to get their attention. 

“Who’s in charge?”  I look around and a middle-aged man walks up.  I should have guessed from the clipboard.  He smiles and does his best not to stare.

“Hey there… Frank.  Irish Cream Cold Brew, Venti.”

He stares at me.  I wink.

“Wow, dead on.  How do you do that?”

“Fae Magic.  I got a favor to ask, a tree on my lot got marked.  Why and how do I fix it?” 

He looks a little confused but ignores my smart-ass answer.  “We have that as an Eastern Red Cedar.  It has tip blight.  Better to keep that from spreading to some of the younger trees on the block.”

“And how do I keep that tree alive?”

He looks at me for a few seconds.  “Get it checked out.  If you can have someone certified by the city to state that it is either not diseased or it is under control and there is no risk of infection from some sort of game plan and get that into City Works by Wednesday of next week, we won’t touch the tree.”

I nod.

“Just between you and me, if you get rid of the paint we have to come in and check with the owner and you can show us the paperwork then, I’ll put a note in to not cut the Starbucks tree until we check.”

“I could kiss you Frank.”

“What’s stopping ya?!”

I kiss Frank on the lips.  I let the kiss last more than 5 seconds, so he has a bunch of guys hollering.  I look at his ring, put my hand to my chest and in my best southern drawl, born of 2 decades of living in the state of Georgia say loudly, “I do declare, I didn’t know you were married, you cad!”  I wink and kiss him on the cheek as I leave.  Everyone is laughing.

I go up to Connie.  “Come on, take my hand, gorgeous, I am buying you a tea to calm your nerves.”  She looks to maybe protest but just decides to let me drag her into the shop.  We get her tea, walk into the back and I sit her down on the couch next to my desk. 

I spend an hour making calls, looking things up and generally forcing things to happen.  I finally have a concrete plan.  As she watches she seems to calm down. 

“Okay, Connie, Wednesday there will be an arborist here.  He will check your tree.  You are sure you don’t have a fungus?’

“GROSS PAT!!!!  I take care of my tree, it just needs some pruning and the dead branches caused by damage from some stupid New Yorkers removed.  It isn’t sick.  I am not that kind of gal.”

I wink and kiss her on the cheek.  “Wouldn’t change anything if it was sick, just means the tree doc has to set up a plan.  Either way, we will get the paperwork done after he checks out the tree and then I will take it to the city works office and make sure they have a copy.  No one is touching that tree with intent to kill it.  I’ll chain myself to it if I have to.  Got it?”

She looks at me and her tears start back up.  “It’s the last of my grove.  If it dies, I do.”

She must have seen something in my look, she gasps.  “Not happening.  Got me?”

She nods and I hug her.  “I have to go home soon, will you be alright?  Can you come with me?”  She shakes her head.  “I can’t go more than a few blocks from my grove.  Right now that is my only tree, none of the others nearby are old enough or strong enough or of my line.”  I am sure I look sad. 

“I will be alright Pat.  You have given me something special.  Hope.  I’ll hold on to it and be okay until we know in a few days.”

 

**AUGUST 13**

We have a new game in my home.  “When will Jackie’s girlfriend Cindy motorboat Pat?”  The answer is always “tonight” but the timing varies.  In her defense, the first three or four times were accidents.  I am just a hair under 6’1” tall.  She is 5’3” on a good day.  Her face is literally boob height.  I am walking down the hall, talking to her and she turns just as I am about to give her a hug from behind.  Face full of boobies.  We both laughs.  And then she fucking motorboats me.  Noise and all. 

But now, now it is a game to her.  She keeps trying to up it too.  I am usually in a hoodie and sweatpants at home because I like my comfy and the pervs all are lewd if I am not.

 I love them. 

She is making it a game to get me when I am fresh out of the shower or cooking, or similar and have less layers.  Jackie usually high fives her. 

Ricardo did this last time.  “Good one.”  He fucking complimented her on managing to get me coming out of the shower.  No towel or anything. 

“Why are you so intent on my boobs?”  I feel like broaching this will help me get an angle to get her to stop.

“Low D cups in my face.  You have any idea how many people would pay for that?”  She smiles up at me. 

“And yet I see no dollar bills in my bras.”

Cindy looks at me with her eyes wide open and leaves the room.  I am pretty proud of myself.  Jackie is looking at me like I am an idiot and Ricardo is sharing the look.

Cindy walks in with a wad of dollar bills. 

“Where the fuck did you get that?”

“Funny thing, I have been dancing at a club to make some money and I have no issue sharing what these girls earn for some of that action.” I am simply dumbfounded.

Jackie and Ricardo share the laughter of those who had the joke land hard.  They knew about her work.  “So, how long have you been doing this and why did everyone but me know?”

A couple of months, just every other weekend.  And Ricardo walked in on my second night. 

He stops laughing as I turn my head and look at him.  “Went to a club to look at dancers and never told me, your girlfriend… huh?”  He starts turning white.

“It was Hector’s birthday.  I also wasn’t really going to mention her job without permission, you know?” Poor guy is struggling.  This is so great.  I shouldn’t…

Cindy walks up and kisses him on the cheek.  “He is such a gentleman.  He didn’t grope me and still gave me like 20 in singles.  And his hands were not wandering beyond where I put them during the private dances.”  She winks at him.  At that precise moment he realizes he shouldn’t have kept a secret from me.

“Private dances too.”  I draw out the next two syllables.  “Dan… CES…Multiple.”  I am not mad, but hell will freeze over before I let this opportunity go to waste. “Where exactly were those hands put, by the way?”  I gotta watch this poor man that is obviously attracted to her squirm. And that question has her wide eyed and afraid.  Jackie is enjoying this so much.

He looks at the other girls, realizes he has no allies here and goes with the tried and true path to survival.  “I was wrong, you are right.  I am sorry honey.  I wanted to let her get some money she needed, and I should have told you.”  Smooth, recovery.  Good job, lover. 

I kiss him on the cheek.  “Next time invite me.  And YOU!!”  I point at Cindy, “Sex work is real work, be it dancing or whatever and I am not going to look down on you.  Heaven knows I have no room to talk.”

They all stare at me.  Fuck.  Stupid mouth.

I start to walk to my room.

“STOP RIGHT THERE AND START TALKING, NOW.”  Jackie nearly shouts. Ugh, *Jackie. Let me have some secrets?*

Fuck. Now I gotta explain.

“So, Georgia has military bases.  Like near Augusta.  And women that need to make rent because their waitress gig isn’t paying enough in tips can go to clubs near them and strip.  Especially good for 18 and 19 year olds. Go on the right day and you can make good money.  You may even get lucky and find a few guys that aren’t handsy.  Good job being amazing, honey.”  I kiss Ricardo on the cheek.

“Okay, so let’s try this all again, Cindy, stop assaulting me without warning.  Ricardo, ask if you wanna spend money on her so she doesn’t feel like it is handouts.  And Jackie…”

“What the fuck did I do?”

“Quit living vicariously through Cindy getting motorboats.”

“Awwwwwww, no fair.”

I walk over to her, grab her head and shove her face in my boobs.  Jiggle jiggle jiggle.  “There, now you are not doing it vicariously.”

“I hate you.”  She is redder than a tomato.  She huffs, stomps her foot and storms out. 

“Love you too, firestorm.”

She gives me the middle finger as she is walking away, stops and turns around.  I see her wink.  Now she might stop putting Cindy up to it. 

**August 14**

The arborist is checking Connie’s tree out.  He takes out some equipment and checks the bark along with some cutting equipment.  He prunes some dead branches and then comes back. 

“Miss Wallace, here is the report, I will have something more official sent to your e-mail once I am back at the office.  But the initial findings are no fungus, tip blight or anything else.  She’s a heathy gal.  I believe it was a misdiagnosis.  I am recommending some care updates as she is a bit stressed from the environment and it may cause her to get something if not careful.”

Connie looks at me defiantly.  “Told you there were no diseases!”  I laugh. 

I hand the doctor his cashier’s check for the service, shake his hand and thank him.  “You saved a life, Doc.”  He nods.  He looks at the tree and smiles.  “Glad I did, she’s a beautiful specimen.”

I look at Connie.  “Couldn’t agree more.”

I talk with Connie for an hour or so before the official documentation shows up.  I print out two copies, grab one, and tell Connie I will see her in a few.  I then head to the company car and drive it to the City Works office before it closes.  I am not chancing this.

When I get back to the shop I grab a bucket with soap I got for this and with Connie’s help I remove that hateful x from her tree.  The hug I get from her after is worth every moment spent making this happen.

 

**August 21****^(st)**

Frank walks in with his guys.  Connie is still out there.  I think she is making sure some ironic mistake isn’t going to show up.  I hand Frank his drink and the paperwork before he gets to the counter. 

“Woah, you really did it!  Wow, you are something miss Wal…”  I put my finger to his lips.  In my sourther drawl I say loud enough to get a few of his guys to hear, “We are on a first name basis, sugah.  Call me Pat.” 

I hear laughs. 

“Okay Pat, just don’t kiss me, my wife got mad last time.”

Jackie pipes up from behind me, “Your loss pal.”  A lot of laughs respond to that.

“The tree is safe?”

“Yes Miss… Pat.  The guys won’t touch it.  I didn’t want to cut it anyway and it looks great now.  I am telling Guido he is a fucking moron. Tip Blight my ass…  So, about the drink?”

“Consider it payment for answering a need.  Thank you, Frank, you are an absolute doll.”

I hug him and he and his guys grab the drinks they want and leave. 

Connie waves them off happily and then comes in. Her eyes are damp.  She smiles at me. 

Behind me Jen chuckles.  “Another rival in the fan club.” 

Henry laughs. 

“A dangerous one.”  Jackie isn’t laughing as she says it.

*How on earth is Connie dangerous?*

 

**September 3****^(rd)**

It is early Sunday morning.  I am getting the lobby ready to open.  Ricardo came over with me because he is the absolute sweetest man on the planet.  Oh, and the man seems unwilling to be at home with just Jackie and Cindy.  Heh.  Coward.  It is sweet though.  I guess he is worried I will believe he is jumping them or something? 

I guess their open thing has sort of rubbed off on me.  I am not worried.  They have been wearing stuff around us that is far too risqué for so long that if he was to snap, he would have by now.  I trust him.  I guess I actually wouldn’t be upset if he asked for permission and it was one of them.  Probably.  I feel like I might be upset if it was Jackie. Upset or…  Anyway, it is about trust. And I trust him and them to not hurt me.

What I don’t trust is the chances of a certain King of the Dragons…  Nathair Sgiathach, sworn enemy of my sanity, showing up alone.  Ricardo will see him.

*Shit.*

The bell chimes for the dragon as he walks in by himself.  Every Sunday, like clockwork, he gets up before Emmantiensien does.  Every Sunday he wants his coffee.  Every Sunday he stumbles in by himself and gets it.  I don’t know why I hope otherwise. 

Ricardo reacts much as I think he will.  He stares.  He watches a 2-foot-long pseudo-dragon with gossamer wings that he likely can’t see because he is too far away from us come to the counter.   I smile, because I do love this little jerk, I really do.  “Venti Pistachio Latte with an extra quad of espresso shots again today?”  He nods his little head and produces coins from the ether.  He is still too groggy to talk or do much of anything besides walk like a  four-legged zombie.

He then drops a $5 bill in the tip jar and waits.  I can salvage this.

Aaaaaaand Ricardo walks up.  There went the salvaging thing.

Nathair looks up at Ricardo as my boyfriend begins to look at him.  He nods.  Ricardo nods. 

“Wassup mortal lover of my second favorite barista?”

“Not much, little dragon.  You come here enough to have favorites?”  He is digging and I can feel some anger already coming from him.

“Yes, Jacqueline is my favorite.  Everything she makes tastes extra spicy.  I think it is the passion she has spills over.  OH!”

Since it is just the two of them I walk over and hand Nate his drink.  “Here you are, my SECOND favorite little troublemaker.”

“Am I in trouble?

I nod.  “You really gotta wait for Em to wake up, you little scamp.”

“BUT HE TAKES SO LOOOOOOOONG!!!”  The drama.  Dear lord.  I swear I am looking at a Husky complaining about something.

“Go home, Dragon King.  And think on how you just revealed your existence to a mortal I am dating.”

He is drinking his Latte when he realizes the implications.  “My apologies for the conversation you are about to have.  I can feel his annoyance now.  I really do need my caffeine sometimes.”

“Love you bud, now shoo.  Next week wait for the King of Treants or there will be trouble.  I have to talk to my honey.”

 

Ricardo watches him FLY TO THE DOOR…  Dammit Nate.  “So, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?”

“That was Nate.  Pseudo dragon.  A type of fairy.  Like in the stories.”

He sort of blinks a lot at me.  “They are real?”

“Yep.”

“And they get coffee here?”

“Yep.”

“And you have known for a while.”

“Yep.”

“And Jackie knows.”

“Yep.”  Let him work it out Pat.

“And no one told me.”

“Nope.  Contrary to that interaction, they are not exactly benign creatures.  They are creatures of passion and whims.  They can seduce mortals easily and things can be messy if you are too involved with them.”

He nods and then he completely throws me for a loop.  “Is Jackie one?”

“NO!  Why the hell would you ask?”

“He chuckles.  Listen to your description of them again…”

…  Well, fuck, he isn’t wrong.  But I know she isn’t.  Don’t I?  No, she definitely isn’t.

 

The bell chimes.  Mab walks in.  Well fuck.

“Good morning, Queen of Sky and Darkness.  Have you met my boyfriend, Ricardo?’ my voice can’t mask my chagrin.   I am punching in her elixir.

Mab almost laughs.  “He just find out?”  I nod.  She does laugh now.

“Good  morning.  I trust you have many questions for your lady about us.  I may be able to answer some as a favor…”

“Yes I do. I was wondermmmmmmmmmph.”  I had almost gotten started on her elixir.  Almost. 20 shots of espresso with energy drinks is not a quick drink.

“Mab, rule 4 is be hospitable. Now we both know trading favors without knowing the full conditions is impolite…”

She winks at me. “Oh, I am sure you would both enjoy any favor I asked of you.”  Her voice is so sultry that I am pretty sure my panties vanished into whatever realm Ricardo’s inhibitions just fucked off to. Yep, his inhibitions are wearing my panties like it is a party hat.  I can see his reaction from here. As can she.

“He gets it. And I likely would as well, darling one.”  Mab, y*ou really need to stop making me lower my straight girl percentage.*

Her expression tells me she has no intention of stopping.

“Mab, if I may get your drink ready, please stop making my boyfriend horny when I can’t take advantage of it.  Honey, I will answer all questions as soon as I can. Be right back.  Oh, before I go, rule 1 is don’t give them your full name. Do you understand?  I am dead serious, lover.  Do not.”

He nods and suddenly gets the severity of the situation. Still, he has been dealing with me and the ladies for months now so he has learned some fearlessness.  “I am sure if I google you I am going to find out something.”

“Oh please do, this will be fun!”  She smiles and I continue my work.

 

I have her elixir ready. This thing is still a thing of nightmares.  I hand it to her and my poor boyfriend is the whitest I have ever seen him.  She motions for him to lean down and kisses his cheek. She whispers in his ear and I have to listen to this. So, I do.

“You are a wonderful sport. Most people are unable to remain in my vicinity for very long once they know who I am. I can count the number of mortals that can on the fingers of one hand.  You know 2 of them. Now I have added another. Farewell, Ricardo.  And do be sweet to this one, Patricia, my dear friend. I like him.”  That last bit was for me.  She knows I was listening.

He walks up.  “Um…”

“I heard.”

“How?!”

I shrug.  “In this place, I can hear anything that goes on, be anywhere I want, and reject anyone I believe deserves to leave. There is a deal between them and me…”

“YOU MADE A DEAL WITH FAIRIES?!”

I sigh.  “Not so loud, please.  Not intentionally. Mostly it is in place to thank me and to keep me safe, I think. Only 2 or 3 incidents where things went poorly and one of the Courts showed up to help each time.”

“I have so many more questions.”

I grab his hand. “I know. I will answer every one of them as soon as I can.  Shoot.”

“Is this why the owner of a franchise that could just stay home and do books or have some managers do everything keeps showing up for odd shifts and acts like a really busy barista with tons of extra work?”  Not the question I was expecting.

I consider how to phrase this. “It is and there is more. I LIKE meeting new people. Be they Fae or a New Yorker or a businessperson passing by or a tourist. I love meeting them. The Fae are a particular joy as I have to think about how we interact and they are so genuine in their joy.  Even if I were filthy rich I would be working this place just to be able to see them. I also want my family safe. Every employee is part of my family as are you and Cindy. I have kept you away from here, mostly, so you wouldn’t be in danger. Because, Ricardo, they are dangerous sometimes. More so than people.”

He nods. He shows me what he saw on Mab in a search. It was not flattering.  “She is nicer than I thought she would be.”

“You are a very polite guy. Hell, you try not to stare too much in public at any gal, and you have even closed your eyes when Jackie is in a towel.”  *Not Cindy tho..  heh.*

His phone alarm interrupts us. “Gotta go see the Abuela. We will talk more, right?”

With no one else in the lobby yet, I grab him and pull him forward so I can get a kiss. “Absolutely, honey. Have fun and give them all hugs for me.”

He leaves and I stare at the empty lobby.

“He is such a good guy. I don’t deserve him…”

From behind me I hear Henry pipe up “Three good things about yourself, Pat.”  I can HEAR his fucking smile.  Jen snickers.

Mother Fucker.  I forgot they were here.

 

**September 5th**

“Nee-chan, I need your help!”

The lanky Troll in front of me is absolutely being sincere and I am going to be as well. Asking for help is the equivalent of asking for a favor. And unseelie will rarely ask.  “What do you need?”

He looks at me and has an almost pitiful look. “I… um… Beth… um…”

I wait. He will get there. He has grown a lot since he began coming here. I can wait a minute while he composes himself for me.

“I need a place to live that isn’t under a bridge.  Beth wants to visit my place.  I told her it is a bad time as I am moving.  Do you know any…”

I am already pointing at the community board. Skerrit never took down his apartment advertisement.  It’s enchanted to make sure he doesn’t have to worry about people reading it that should not.  Only fairies and those that know of them can see that advertisement.  He still has at least one room from what I was told a few weeks ago.  Todd turns and goes to the board. He sees it.

“How can I…”

I hold my hand up.  “Stop.  Pointing a finger at a board is not much for help.  Skerrit has a vacant room, and you would be a great upstairs neighbor.  If you need actual help, tell me when to show up with moving clothes on to help you load a truck.”

He smiles. “Nee-chan is best chan!!”

“Your girlfriend is best chan, I am best sister!”

From the lobby Jackie yells out, “HEY!”

 

**MOVING DAY!!!**

We arrive at a bridge. I look around. I am not sure how to deal with this when I see Todd sort of appear out of the wall. Jackie and I look at each other. She speaks volumes for both of us. “Dafuq?!”

As we get closer we can see a door that is so effective at concealing itself that I wonder if it is a portal. “Hey, Todd, about this door…?”

“Nope. Just human ingenuity. No glamour. Part of why I loved living here. Internet isn’t bad either. Come on in.”

 

We step in and the world stops making sense. The place is mostly packed up. But the walls are concrete and place is like a hobbit home.  Also, it is huge. The water pipes and such probably would detract from living here, but it is so cool I wouldn’t care.

“You are giving this up to have a girl visit?

“She’s special. So much so she has become a regular at the shop.  Café Mocha, extra shot, tall sound familiar?”

I laugh.  “Dude. That order is so **not** weird it could be anyone.”

“Call for Beth, the babe.”

I smile. “Green eyed blonde with the cutest god damned dimples I have ever seen.  Almost my height, so 5’10-11? And a rack that makes me really fucking jealous while she probably has back pain that doesn’t.”

Jackie looks at me. “You really are a fucking machine like that. It is scary.”

I shrug.  “Super power.”

Jackie looks at Todd, “Your boxes barely take up a quarter of this space.  You throw a lot out or?”

“Nah, had a lot of open space. Was nice. I can handle not having it. The rental truck is waiting, let’s get to it.”

 

4 hours, a lot of elevator rides and some sore backs later, Todd is completely moved in.  He has boxes in a lot of spots but is so happy I can’t help but smile. “I gotta see your place!”  We laugh and head down.

“How am I going to repay you for this favor?”  We both knew he would ask. We had a plan.

Jackie speaks up for us.  “Pizza, beer.  Traditional payment for moving someone in. Sounds fair.”

He laughs and pulls out his cell.  He then opens an app and shows us the order he has ready.  “Canadian bacon and cream cheese sounds so wrong but I know it is your favorite, Jackie. And vanilla sausage for my big sis Pat.  Sound like a plan?” 

We laugh and agree as I open our door. Inside we are met with Cindy wearing a what I hope is sugar free whip cream.  It kind of counts as a bikini… “Welcome home Jackie!”

Todd’s eyes almost bug out. I am trying not to laugh and both Cindy and Jackie are in a state of shock.  “I thought I told you we were moving Todd today?”

“I put it on my calendar as next weekend. I had ‘make Jackie get a moth full of cream’  for tonight on it…”I have to hand it to Cindy; she definitely has a way with wording. Also, the whip cream. How is that not falling off?

“So, remember Todd? Kinda like our brother. Broke the whole Fae thing to you and apparently made comments about how your finger smelled… Todd, you remember Cindy, she regularly does evil things to me with those fingers in bed…” He nods.

I smile. “I am so glad Ricardo isn’t watching all this…”

AH-HEM.

“YOU ARE HERE?!?!?!”  My shock and wonderment as to what these two have been doing is evident. 

Todd sounds annoyed as he calls out, “Dude, she put on a whip cream bikini, and you are just watching like some creep?”

He turns the corner, and I see he has a similar outfit….   Just whip cream along a very specific part, “She mentioned it and I thought it was a good idea…”

I am about 59 shades of red here. Holy fuck, how did my cheeks get this much blood this fast?!

And Todd finally manages to whisper so only Jackie and I hear him. “I thought nymphs were bad, also, he has got to be part Centaur…”

I am now an extra 17 shades of red. But no, no, Todd  wasn’t done.

“Dude, why put whip cream on what is obviously a baseball bat?”

Ricardo freezes and stares.  I think Todd broke him.  Todd broke my extremely confident and hilarious man.  He is obviously trying to respond but simply lacks the brainpower as he caught me licking my lips.  *I am SO going to have dessert.  The baseball bat is moving…*

Ricardo finally managing to recover from the stimulus, begins to outdo me in shades of red within a second, and runs into the living room, heading to my bedroom. Heh. Dessert is served.

“You broke my boyfriend, asshole!”

“Nee-chan, if he is using that thing, he does plenty of breaking himself…  Huh, Winter Queen, Summer Queen, and Size Queen.”

Jackie nearly busts something as the laughing fit turns into wheezing. I am simply too shocked to respond. Cindy looks at us, “so about Todd, does he like whip cream, and is he staying the night?”  Her wink hints that he absolutely should.

I take some solace in it being Todd’s turn to become redder than a tomato. *Serves you right, fucker!*

“Pardon me, I gotta go to my room and get some whip cream.”

 

**November 14**

It has been about two months since I put a stop to the Cindy motorboating Pat game.  That game has been replaced with something so much worse I am unsure what to say or do.

“Simon says motorboat Cindy.”  Almost immediately after Jackie says it, Ricardo bends forward and does it.  I sigh.  How did we get here?  Oh yea.  Cindy kept asking if she could motorboat me and I got sick of it and started this stupid thing. 

“Simon says motorboat Jackie.”  I said, thinking that would stop this crap.  And of course she did.  Then Cindy pipes up with “Simon says motorboat Pat.” And it devolved from there.  Now the rules are that whoever does it first gets to pick the next person to do. 

For over a week I have not been able to motorboat anyone first.  And they are conspiring to continue it indefinitely.  I have almost gotten Cindy twice and Jackie once only to be beaten by Ricardo who is doing it just to help them out.  If I didn’t like him so much I would be kinda pissed because the man has been enjoying this game far too much.

Ricardo thinks he has me beat as I begin to move towards the kitchen.  “Simon says motorboat Jackie.”  Cindy is almost as surprised as Jackie is when I leap over the couch and get to the recliner.  My face is in her E cups before she can register it and I am shaking my head.  She laughs and my error becomes apparent as she lets the single button holding her top closed come open and I am now inside that shirt and face to boob for real.  She isn’t wearing a bra.  She grabs the back of my head and pushes me in further.  I feel like this is retribution.

I am beginning to wonder if this wasn’t some sort of plan as she has been going braless more and more. 

I come up for air.  “Okay, this was planned, and you can’t tell me otherwise.”  I try to get away.

“Awwww.  She figured it out. Come back!!!”

I glare at all of them.  “You three are making it hard to not make this into some carnal sex house.  Knock it off. 

Jackie walks up and kisses me on the cheek.  “Never.”  I hide my smile. Why am I so happy?  Oh, this is a family.  I haven’t had a big one in years.

 

 

**December 14**

Fiadh, the Banshee, walks into the lobby and waves curtly to May.  She seems to be upset.  It is snowing.  Pretty bad weather and my bus ride in saw no less than 3 accidents.  It is miserable out there.  She picks up her mobile order and sits down. She and May are already best friends. On the way she stops by and hugs Cindy. They have talked quite a bit over the last few weeks.

Henry walks up and says, “You are like some sort of match maker sometimes.  If I remember right, you asked Lemar to start helping you brush up on ASL thanks to May and then he started practicing with her. Next thing we know, they are engaged.” He is chuckling.

I laugh.  “There was a time when he was terrified I was going to have to fire him.”  Henry gasps at me.  I look at Henry.

“Rule 3 is no joke. The only exception to it being an absolute was carved out because these two belong together and I would be damned for eternity trying to stop it.  I can count the number of other patrons I would add to the exception list on one hand and have fingers left over.”  *I can’t date any of the ones I am attracted to as it would be bad for everyone.*

Lemar walks up. He is getting ready to leave. “Boss, I have um… okay, can you come over to the table?”

I do my “Spock eyebrow” thing and follow anyway.

We hear a car screech outside as we sit in the booth and what sounds like a collision.  Great, another one.  It sounds close but if there is anything to worry about, someone will come in and tell us.

May smiles as Lemar scoots in next to her. She begins to sign, “We want a summer wedding. I want you to be my maid of honor.  Fiadh, I want you to be a bridesmaid.”

We both look on in shock and sign simultaneously “you are kidding, right?”

She laughs her breathy laugh and shakes her head. “Serious.”  She points at me, “You introduced us. You have been my friend and even relaxed your rule 3 for me. I can think of no one else better. And you, Fiadh, have been my friend for a few months. In that time you have put so many of my fears and worries to bed. I actually don’t have many friends…”

Fiadh grabs May’s hands and squeezes. She smiles sadly at May. “I would be honored,” she signs. She looks upset though.  Why?  Her eyes dart outside.  *Huh.*

May looks at me.  Oh yea, I should answer her question. “Duh. Yea. Of course. Just thought you might have someone better. Not going to say no to you, sweetheart.  I do suggest you rethink the maid of honor and pick her.”  I point at Fiadh.  “She’s your best friend.  We are friendly, but she and you are as close as Jackie and I are.” Fiadh makes a small noise.

She smiles. “Oh, that reminds me, when is Jackie in next? I have two more bridesmaids planned and I need to ask her to be one.”  Fiadh flinches.            *Wait*.

“She is late. Should be here so Lemar can clock out.”      *No.*

From the corner of my eye I see Fiadh start crying.  Really crying… She squeezes my hand and then she gets up and starts walking towards Cindy…

My blood turns to ice.

*No.  NO.  NO!   NONONO!   NOOOOOO!*

*Reuters is compromised 

*CNN is paid off by Pakistanis

*French intelligence officials confirming Rafael kills are under black magic influence of Pakistani phuppos

*US officials claiming Indian jets have been downed are lying because they are afraid that India will take its place as a global super power by end of next week

Clocked out late with aching feet,
Mopped the blood and dragged the meat.
Locked the door, the moon was high—
Now guess who’s back? Yeah. It’s this guy.

Phone blew up before the dawn,
“Hey can you open?”—Yawn. Yawn. Yawn.
Eyes still red, no coffee brewed,
Shoved on pants and swallowed mood.

Third guy’s ghostin’, shocker there,
He won’t respond, he doesn’t care.
But if he does, he’ll dodge with flair:
“Can’t tonight, man—I open there.”

Oh, do you? Cool. So do I.
Yet here I am, dead sleep deprived.
Running on fumes and bitter pride,
Just tryin’ not to homicide.

Same damn story, every week,
I grind my soul while they play weak.
But I’m the “rock,” the “team,” the “glue”—
Translation: do the work of two.

And somewhere deep in my dismay,
I scream the line I say each day:
“I wasn’t even supposed to be here today!”

But not for long—I’m done, I’m free.
Next Thursday ends this misery.
They’ll call, they’ll beg, they’ll shout, “Don’t go!”
But I’ve got bigger flames to stoke.

Close to open? Not again.
I’m cashin’ out. Amen. The end.

I grabbed for my pills beside my bed, where I had placed a 20mg and 10mg pill. But I could only find one. I took it and also had a caffeine tablet, 100mg. Had a bit of a look but nothing, I will find it later. 

30 min later i have a proper search and I can't find it anywhere! Im wondering if I took it in my sleep and thats why I had a light sleep? Was it the 10mg or 20mg that I took? I decided it was best to take another 20 than to underdose. 

I'm really struggling this morning so I have a cup of coffee. Then it dawns on me that maybe I put a 30mg pill beside my bed! So that means I would have had 50mg and double my usual caffeine! I take 5mg propranolol to be on the safe side.

[[Explore Top Rated cup holder tray on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/clearance/?kw=cup holder tray)

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal cup holder tray combines functionality, durability, and ease of use. Analyzing key features helps in assessing a product's suitability for individual requirements.

**Adjustable base:** A global fit is crucial for cup holder trays.

Most high-quality cup holder trays feature an adjustable base that expands or contracts to securely fit into various car cup holder sizes. Look for models with rotating bases that allow for fine-tuning the fit and preventing wobbling or instability during driving. An adjustable base ensures compatibility with a wide range of vehicles, from compact cars to SUVs.

**360-Degree swivel:** Maneuverability and accessibility are paramount.

A 360-degree swivel functionality provides enhanced convenience,allowing the tray to be positioned at the optimal angle for both driver and passenger accessibility. This feature is particularly useful when sharing items placed on the tray or when needing to adjust the tray's position to avoid obstructing the gear shift or other controls. The swivel mechanism should be smooth and sturdy to maintain stability even when the tray is loaded with items.

**Expandable Upper Tray:** Maximizing surface area is key to functionality.

Many cup holder trays feature an expandable upper tray section that provides additional surface area for holding larger items, such as smartphones, tablets, or food containers. The expandable tray should be easy to deploy and retract, and it should lock securely in place to prevent accidental collapses.Check the weight capacity of the expandable tray to ensure it can safely support the items you intend to place on it.

**non-Slip Surface:** Security and stability are essential for safe use.

A non-slip surface is crucial for preventing items from sliding or shifting during transit, especially when navigating turns or sudden stops. Look for trays with a textured rubber or silicone surface that provides a secure grip. some trays also include raised edges or retaining walls to further contain items and prevent spills.

**Durable Construction:** Longevity is crucial for sustained use.

The construction material of a cup holder tray significantly impacts its durability and longevity.High-quality trays are typically made from ABS plastic, wich is known for its impact resistance and heat resistance. Ensure that the tray is sturdy and well-built, with no flimsy or weak points. A durable construction ensures that the tray can withstand daily use and resist damage from wear and tear.

**Easy Cleaning:** Maintenance determines long-term usability.

A cup holder tray is bound to accumulate spills and crumbs over time, making easy cleaning a critical factor. Opt for a tray with a smooth, non-porous surface that can be easily wiped clean with a damp cloth.Some trays also feature removable components that can be washed separately, either by hand or in a dishwasher.

Key features of a high-quality cup holder tray include:

*Adjustable Base

*360-Degree Swivel

*Expandable Upper Tray

*Non-Slip Surface

*Durable Construction

*Easy Cleaning

I spent a long time suffering. A few months ago, I beat it, became a different, truer person.
I started taking walks, enjoying nature and listening to music. Also talking to people in the park and playing with sticks. 
At this point, I'd neglected my work in favour of self care. It was the right move. Now, with more balance in my life, I had to figure out how to get back to my working life. I'll always prioritize myself, not work. I'll never do something that doesn't give me joy. I enjoy my studies, I simply needed balance and purpose.
I started going to a coffee shop to do work.

Currently: I wake up, go to coffee shop. I do work for a few hours. I go the botanical gardens and play and have fun. While I talk to people, I feel a bit lonely. I think I am very lonely even though I have people. I'm seeking someone or people I can completely open with.

Now my nights are bit boring. I'm feeling unfilfilled. I'm going to start working on my relationship and perception with god. I'm going to delve into the meaning of life and choose my purpose. I'm going to start opening my heart to existence.

I've also written a lot throughout my life. Never got very far in a novel, but I'll keep trying. See what happens.

As someone who loves hosting parties but dreads running out of ice or dealing with bags from the convenience store, this countertop gadget was a game-changer. Compact, efficient, and quite clever, it offers a mix of features and quirks worth diving into.  

**Sleek Design and Compact Size**  
The first thing that grabbed my attention was the modern and sleek design. Measuring just 12.32 x 8.74 x 12.6 inches, it’s surprisingly compact and fits snugly on the corner of my kitchen counter. Its minimalist aesthetic and neutral color scheme complement various kitchen designs, making it versatile for different homes. Though it weighs over 17 pounds, which might seem hefty for some, it feels solidly built, which I appreciate when investing in something meant for frequent use.

**Smart Features You Can Actually Use**  
Pairing this machine with my phone through the GoveeLife app was straightforward. I didn’t think I’d need app control for an ice maker, but having the ability to start the ice-making process while lying on the couch or out running errands? Weirdly satisfying. It also works with Alexa, which means you can casually boss your ice maker around. “Alexa, tell the ice machine to get working,” is something I never imagined I’d say out loud.  

[Ready to snag GoveeLife H7172? See Amazon’s price.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0bqbr9x5q/)  

**Rapid Ice Production and Energy Efficiency**  
This little machine pumps out nine bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes. I tested this during a backyard BBQ, and it kept up beautifully. Over the day, it effortlessly produced 26 pounds of ice while consuming very little power—just 0.1 kWh on average per hour. It’s efficient without feeling like an energy guzzler, a trait that’s both budget- and eco-friendly. For a household of heavy ice-drinkers like mine, this was invaluable.

**App Alerts That Go Beyond What’s Expected**  
What truly sets this ice maker apart are the nifty alerts. I don’t always hover over the kitchen, so getting a notification on my phone when the ice basket is full or when the water tank needs a refill was a lifesaver. No more guessing games or mid-party panics about why it stopped churning out cubes. Scheduling ice-making sessions through the app is another thoughtful touch—it ensures we never run out during family game nights or weekend brunches.  

**Ice for All Occasions**  
I’ve tried all three sizes of the bullet ice cubes, and while the differences felt minor at first, I came to appreciate the flexibility. Small cubes for iced coffee that fits through narrow bottle openings, medium ones for cocktails, and large ones for keeping wines chilled without diluting them too fast. The bullet design prevents them from clumping, which was a pleasant surprise. In a more humid environment, other ice makers I’ve used have had this irritating sticking issue. That’s not been a problem here.

**10-Minute Self-Cleaning for the Win**  
Cleaning appliances is often the bane of my existence, especially something like an ice maker with hidden crevices. Thankfully, this machine makes it easy with its self-cleaning function. By hitting a button on the control panel or through the app, it cycles water through to clean every corner. This feature is perfect for maintaining hygiene. My only tip would be to ensure the machine is thoroughly dried out before storing it, as the manual warns against leftover moisture potentially causing damage.

**Highlights**  
- Sleek and space-saving design complements any kitchen.  
- App and Alexa integration for convenient control.  
- Fast ice-making process with minimal energy use.  
- Alerts that notify when the ice basket is full or water is running low.  
- Self-cleaning mode ensures easy maintenance.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The machine’s weight can make it a hassle to move frequently.  
- It’s slightly pricier than non-smart ice makers, which could deter some buyers.  
- Occasionally, app pairing takes a couple of attempts to establish.  

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing this with other ice makers like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker and the Igloo Countertop Ice Maker, the GoveeLife stands out in a few areas. Its smart app compatibility and voice control options feel more advanced compared to the simpler operations of the Igloo. On the other hand, the GE Opal’s nugget-style ice has a cult following, but it comes at nearly twice the price. For a countertop option with consistent performance, multiple ice cube sizes, and automation, the GoveeLife feels like the ideal middle-ground for everyday use.   

**Price Performance**  
At its current price point, this isn’t the cheapest option out there, but you’re paying for convenience and thoughtful features. If automation, app alerts, and smart scheduling aren’t priorities for you, simpler models will save you a few bucks. However, for a machine that managed to blend modern technology with daily practicality, it’s reasonable to classify it as a worthy investment.

1kigd1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1kigd1m/our_shop_has_too_many_things_going_on_at_the_same/,Our shop has too many things going on at the same time,"Perhaps Im being dramatic but I believe our shop has too many different things going on at the same time, especially considering that we are only two people working at the same time, even at rush hours.

A bit of context: In our shop we offer: 
- Homemade ice cream (over 20 flavors)
- Cakes and pastries 
- Coffee
- A wide selection of alcoholic drinks, like wines and spritzes 
- A shop with a bunch of italian products
- Almost everything also available to take away
- Sandwiches which we have to make when they get ordered (so not pre made) and then get heated for 10 mins on a grill
- Lasagna (again we have to heat it) + fresh salad with dressing (we prepare it in the moment)
- Table service
- Also since our dishwasher  and sink is right next to the coffee machine in plain sight of the costumers we have to keep it clean.
- We take part in events like special ice cream deals which drive even more costumers to the shop.
- This is pretty normal but ill include it anyway: costumers leave the dirty dishes on the tables even in the outside area so we are required to clear the tables asap.

All of these things don’t have time restrictions (like alcoholic beverages from 4pm or lasagnas from 12pm), so someone could come at 12 and order an Aperol Spritz, icecream, and a sandwich, while the next person just wants a cappuccino to go.

Like I said it is only 2 people working at the same time, sometimes during the week only one as the other person is usually in the back making the ingredients for the lasagna and sandwiches (because we make it ourselves 😆)

Idk do you think this is normal? Or should I talk with the owners about perhaps reducing some of our services or at least the time in which we offer them?

SYDNEY'S POV

I received a pornographic video.""Do you like this?""

The man speaking in the video is my mate and husband,Alexander Torres, the Alpha of the Nightscar Pack, whom I haven't seen for several months. He is naked, his shirt and pants scattered on the ground, thrusting forcefully on a woman whose face I can't see, her plump and round breasts bouncing vigorously. I can clearly hear the slapping sounds in the video, mixed with lustful moans and grunts.

""Yes, yes, f\*\*k me hard, Alpha,"" the woman screams ecstatically in response.

""You naughty she-wolf!"" Alexander growls, his voice low and predatory. He stands up and flips her over, slapping her buttocks as he speaks. ""Stick your ass up!""

The woman giggles, turns around, sways her buttocks, and kneels on the bed.

I feel like someone has poured a bucket of ice water on my head. It's bad enough that my mate is having an affair, but what's worse is that the other woman is my own sister, Bella.

I let the video play, watching and listening to the two of them having s\*x, my disgust being provoked time and time again. Every time I hear their moans, my heart feels like it's being stabbed.

My wolf, Aria, growls inside my mind, her voice sharp and furious. 'How dare he betray you like this? He’s your mate!'

I suppress Aria’s rage, forcing myself to stay calm.

The cheating continues. After a few more slaps, he grabs her buttocks, thrusts his c\*\*k deep into her, and starts pounding vigorously.

After a few more thrusts, Alexander and Bella moan together as they climax. They collapse on the bed, kissing .

""Do you treat my sister like this in bed too?"" Bella's coquettish voice rings out, her tone dripping with mockery.

""Don't mention her,"" Alexander's ruthless voice echoes through the video, his Alpha authority making his words cut deeper. ""I haven't even kissed her, she can't compare to you at all.""

""I knew you only loved me!"" Bella smiles satisfied, hooking Alexander's neck, leans in to kiss him, and says, ""I want to do it again!""

Seeing them rolling together again, I feel a wave of nausea and can't watch anymore. I angrily press the pause button, swallowing hard.

I am very clear, this video must have been sent by Bella. She wants to tell me that she still holds Alexander in her grip, and I am powerless against it. Apart from a mating bond and title, Alexander and I don't resemble a mated pair at all. Bella indeed knows how to twist the knife further.

Three years ago, My father, Michael, the Alpha of the Shadowmoon Pack, had made a disastrous investment that left our pack’s company bankrupt. The funding chain was broken, and he owed a massive debt to the pack. To salvage the situation, he had no choice but to arrange a marriage alliance with the Nightscar Pack. Alexander’s wealth and influence were the only lifeline left for our pack.

On that fateful day I never imagined was going to begin the worst turning point of my life, all was made ready to celebrate the union of Bella and Alexander. It was only mere minutes to the mating ceremony when Bella disappeared (or at least found out she was gone). Bella was nowhere to be found.

My parents, who were desperate to salvage the embarrassment and save face in front of the pack or whatever it was they were trying to protect that day, turned to me. They told me to put on my sister's ceremonial dress, to take Bella's place at the altar.

There was no room for argument, neither was I given the choice to say no. I was to be the figurehead, the stand-in mate who'd fulfill the ceremony in Bella's absence. There were no words of blessing and no well-wishes for a happy future. Instead, all I received were instructions to “be a good Luna.”

This was how it all started.

I was left numb, standing there in the borrowed ceremonial dress to exchange vows with a man I barely knew. It felt as though my dreams and aspirations were suddenly overshadowed by the harsh reality of my circumstances. Like my life had been snatched away from me in an instant, and I barely recalled what happiness felt like after that day. I was constrained in every sense of the word.

Did I say this was how it all started?

No, I think it actually dated way back to when I was three and had unfortunately gone missing. For eighteen long years, I lived away from my pack and family. Growing older. As I grew older, from being a pup, to a young wolf, I kept searching for my roots again. And when my long-awaited dream of reuniting with my pack became reality, it was nothing like I'd expected.

There was no joyous reunion, no tears of happiness.

Instead, I was met with something close to indifference.

As if I were a stranger who had wandered into their lives. My parents seemed to have moved on from me after all those years I was gone. All the love they had was for Bella; barely any left for me.

I guess there was nothing left, in fact, because if there was, I would at least be pitied enough to have been told that Bella had returned from abroad and had somehow found her way into my mate's arms.

Almost immediately, my phone buzzed with an incoming video call from Bella. I didn't want to answer it at first, but ended up swiping green. Bella's face popped up on the screen, sitting in the same room from the video with a towel wrapped around her body.

""Hi, hope you're having a happy day over there,"" Bella chirped with a smug smile.

She moved the phone's camera around to show more of the room, and in the background, I caught a faint glimpse of Alexander walking into the bathroom.

""Guess who's going to die a pathetic old virgin? Not me!"" She laughed callously.

I silently clenched my teeth. I was reeling with annoyance from the insult.

""He doesn't deserve you,"" she added. ""He deserves better. And I'm what's perfect for him, darling.""

There was no way I was going to listen to any more of that. I angrily ended the call and flung the phone to the bed, then burying my head in my hands.

I'd had enough. I wasn't going to sit still and let myself be dragged to the ground like a piece of rag any longer.

By the time Alexander would return to the house, it was already well into the night. I sat on the cold tiles of the living room, hanging my chin on my palm and nearly dozing off when I heard the sound of the front door clicking.That familiar musky scent of his filled the air, but beneath it, I could swear I caught the faint trace of Bella’s perfume.

My eyes blinked open, and I raised my head, locking a blank gaze with his face. There was that brick-hard look on his face which he always had when I was around. To think of how he was grinning from ear-to-ear earlier with Bella.

After our mating ceremony, everything I'd been told by my parents to do, I did. Both taking care of his pack,his daily life, and several other things that couldn't be counted, all for three years. It started happening frequently, that it became a ritual, like a dance of habit ingrained in my daily routine. Alexander also accepted it without question. But not for one day did Alexander spare me as much as a second glance.

My wolf, Aria, growled low in my mind, her voice sharp with resentment.

""Three years, Sydney. Three years of giving everything, and for what? A title? You are Luna in name only, and even that title feels like a chain.""

""I know, Aria,I'm tired—tired of living up to everyone else's expectations. I just want to be free.""

Alexander shut the door behind him and began walking into his room. Treating me as usual like I was invisible, and for the first time, I spoke.

""I want to break the mating bond.""

He turned to face me, an incredulous look on his face.

""What are you talking about?""

""I don't want this title of Luna anymore,” I answered without mincing words.

That day three years ago, when I stood in that white dress, and him in his tuxedo, a congregation of pack members behind us and the pack elder in front of us, I saw that calm look of restrained anger in his eyes when he saw that it was not Bella behind the veil, but me.

I remember my chest tightening behind the ceremonial necklace I was wearing. The way his stare burned. How stupid and helpless I felt in that dress. How my parents smiled like they'd not just pushed me out there against my will and the pack cheered with probably no idea of what was going on.

“You may now seal the bond,” the pack elder announced.

Alexander leaned closer towards me, but not for a mark, he merely brushed his face past my cheek and spoke into my ear, “The only thing you can get is the title of Luna.""

And that title is what I was giving back to him. I didn't want it anymore. I wished I'd never let myself take it in the first place. I'd let go of too much of myself and endured more than I needed to. It was the height of it already.

“I want to break the mating bond, Alexander,” I repeated myself in case he didn't hear me the first time—even though I knew he'd heard me clearly.

He stared at me with a frown before answering coldly, ""It's not up to you! I'm the Alpha, and I don't have time for this nonsense. Don't waste my time with such boring topics, or try to attract my attention!""

How typical of him to believe that I was trying to get his attention. I hadn't attracted that so-called attention of his for over three years, and it's when I mention ""breaking the bond"" that he remembers it.

The last thing I was going to do was argue or bicker with him.

""I will have Beta Johnson send the mating bond dissolution papers to the The Elders council,"" was all I said, as calmly as I could muster.

He didn't even say another word after that and just went through the door he'd been standing in front of, slamming it harshly behind him. My eyes lingered on the knob of the door a bit absentmindedly before I pulled the wedding ring off my finger and placed it on the table. Don't even ask why I had it on in the first place.

I grabbed my suitcase, which I'd already had my things packed in, and headed out of the house.

As I walked toward the gate, Beta Johnson suddenly appeared in front of me. He was strong and loyal to Alpha Alexander, but he never respected me.

Johnson blocked my way, looking down at me with a cold smile. ""Luna Sydney,"" he said, his tone mocking. ""Where are you going? The Alpha Alexander didn’t mention you leaving.""

I try to keep my voice calm. ""I’m leaving for a while.""

""Leaving?"" Johnson laughed. ""Trying to get the Alpha’s attention? Don’t waste your time. He doesn’t care about you.""

His words hurt. For years, Alexander had ignored me, and the pack followed his lead.

""Let me pass,"" I said.

Johnson didn’t move. ""You’re still the Luna. Without the Alpha’s permission, you can’t leave.""

My heart ached, but I stood tall. ""Even if he ignores me, I’m still your Luna. You should listen to me.""

For a moment, Johnson hesitated—then moved with a shrug, as if I wasn’t worth the effort.

As I walked away, I heard him mutter: ""Pathetic. A Luna forgotten by her Alpha is worse than an omega.""

I acted like I didn’t hear him. I didn’t care—not anymore.

The wind outside felt different afterward, like a heavy burden was being lifted off my shoulders for the first time in a very long while. The feeling of the night breeze blowing through the strands of my hair was immaculate.

Grabbing my phone from my purse and swiping my fingers quickly across the screen, I put the phone to my ear, hearing it ring.

""I am done with Alexander, come pick me up.”

# Chapter 2

SYDNEY'S POV

The soft wind of the night continued to whip my hair to and fro while I stood outside with my suitcase next to me. I was already out of that house, finally.

The flamboyant red sports car pulled over right in front of where I stood, and an even more flamboyant woman was in the driver's seat twiddling her fingers at me as she wound down the windows.

It was Grace.

Grace was not only my best friend, she was also my business partner and the daughter of the Alpha of the Nightbloom Pack, a small but fiercely independent pack on the borderlands. We've been inseparable since our college days. And because we both shared a passion for fashion, we both decided to turn our dreams into reality by co-founding Luxe Vogue, a fashion-forward online shopping website that quickly became a favorite among young trendsetters.

Grace had a keen eye for design, so she was in charge of designing stunning clothing collections, while I focused on designing jewelry at our equally jointly-owned studio, Atelier. Atelier was a high-end fashion studio catering to elite clientele. Our business acumen and creative vision catapulted us into the world of high-ranking millionaires.

I stepped into the passenger's seat of Grace's car, sighing and immediately clicking my seatbelt in.

""Finally willing to leave that bastard and return to work?"" Grace quipped with a mischievous grin.

""I really don't understand why you would waste three years of your life to take care of an asshole who doesn't love you at all.""

I rolled my eyes, ""Because I was blind, but now I can see. ”

Grace chuckled, starting the car. ""Well, I'm glad your eyes are wide open now. We've got a whole lot to run, we can't have you distracted by some guy who doesn't appreciate you.""

I chuckled, resting my elbow tiredly on the car door. From the onset, Grace had always hated my marriage to Alexander. She had tried, in her way, to convey her disapproval, both indirectly and directly.I was glad we could finally freely talk and make jests about it.

""So, where are we headed now?""

""To the airport, of course. I've got a sudden urge for a short trip.""

Grace leaned back in her seat, resting a hand on the car door while the other stayed on the steering wheel. ""Well, needed anyway.""

""That reminds me,"" Grace said, ""A company is interested in buying the website. And I kid you not, it's an insane offer. I'm tempted.""

""I'm really not in the mood for work right now. We'll talk about that when I return,"" I said, glancing at Grace. Grace nodded understandingly. ""Totally get it.”

I really needed this trip, to get my mind out for a bit, to revel in my freedom from Alexander and the suffocating routine I had fallen into.

Grace pulled into the airport. As the car came to a stop, I dialed a number.

""I'm here now, where are you?"" I spoke first.

Grace looked at me curiously. ""Who was that?"" she asked.

""You'll see,"" I grinned cryptically.

While we waited in the car, a man in a sharp suit approached the car. He was Asher, my trusted lawyer from the Shadowmoon Pack, who had helped me draft the formal request to dissolve the mate bond with Alexander.

Asher opened his briefcase and took out an envelope containing the documents. “Here,” he handed me the papers. I glanced through them one after the other, feeling an overwhelming feeling of finality wash down on me.

""Do you need some more time to go through them?"" Asher asked. I shook my head, determined. ""No, where do I sign?""

He pointed to various areas on the pages, ""Here, here,"" flipping through them, ""over here and here,"" he directed. Then, he handed me a pen.

I signed each page and spot that required my signature.

""I'll have Alpha Alexander receive a copy as well and will send yours too,” he said as he placed the papers back in his briefcase.

“You can have them sent to my mail.”

“Will do,” he said.“Once the papers are signed, your mate bond dissolution request will be submitted to The Elders council. Provided there are no asset disputes, your mate bond will be officially severed within thirty business days”

I nodded, “Thanks,” shaking his hand.

""It's my duty,"" he replied, smiling.

Grace looked at me, ""So, are you going to kill my curiosity now?""

I looked at her and replied, ""That was Asher from the Shadowmoon Pack. I signed the formal request to dissolve the mate bond with Alexander.Everything will be easier if I give up my share of the pack's wealth""

Grace let out a dramatic scream, ""Are you crazy? You're actually giving up on asking him for compensation? He's the Alpha of the Nightscar Pack, you could get a hundred million in assets!""

I chuckled bitterly, ""It doesn't matter. I just want to dissolve this bond as soon as possible! I'm a successful businesswoman by myself,I don't need him to raise my value.""

Grace shook her head, ""But still, a hundred million…” she looked so pained, so much so I nearly chuckled.

I shrugged, ""Let him keep his wealth to himself, I just want to move on with my life.""

“Aww, girl. I totally get it.” Grace reached out and squeezed my hand, ""I'm here for you, no matter what.""

""And that's all that matters to me,"" I smiled and squeezed her hand in return.

""Alright, let's get your things,"" she said, getting out of the car to help me pull my suitcase from the backseat and raising the handle tall.

""Tell all the eligible Alphas, the Queen is back!"" I announced loudly into the wind.

""Woo-hoo! The Queen is back, everyone!"" Grace hooted after me.

Alexander’s POV

I pulled into the driveway of the house, exhausted. Another long day of managing both the pack and the GT Group had left me drained, and all I wanted was to unwind and relax. I stepped out of the car and loosened the collar of my shirt, eager to get inside and finally relax. When I entered the house, I saw Sydney sitting there, staring at me with her usual blank look. I barely spared her a glance while heading straight for my study.

""I want to break the mating bond,"" Sydney said before I could even reach the sanctuary of my study.

Breaking the mating bond?After I returned home from a long day of exhausting work, I heard my Luna wants to break our mate bond? Ridiculous was the first word that came to my mind, and ridiculous it was indeed. The Shadowmoon Pack, Sydney's pack, had formed an alliance with the Nightscar Pack through our mating bond. As part of the agreement, Sydney's family's company merged with the GT Group, which I owned. This was a contract that benefited both parties in every sense of the word. Sydney was only a woman I'd married, who depended on her parents and me for survival.

Breaking the mating bond, huh? It was obviously her new way of crying for attention, like she was fond of doing. It used to be the pitiful demeanor she carried around her, which was enough to convince an outsider that she was being treated wrongly, even though that had never been the case. We'd been keeping up the mated couple facade for three years already.

Now she was pulling a new stunt, which I wasn't going to fall for.

The next morning, I entered the dining room to have breakfast before leaving, but all I was met with was an empty table.

Every morning Sydney would be here preparing breakfast, but now no steaming coffee, no fresh pastries.

Lily POV

I used to think I could withstand anything fate threw at me…

I mean – I was hated by my father and my sister, practically a maid in my own house and the invisible daughter of Alpha Stone … but nothing prepared me for the sight that greeted me.

My hands trembled on the doorknob of my sister’s bedroom as a strangled gasp escaped my lips. The door was slightly ajar, and through the narrow gap, I could see Lucas – my boyfriend and mate-to-be of three years cuddled together with my sister, Vanessa on the bed.

Their voices drifted out, hushed but clear in the quiet hallway.

“Just reject her, and it will be over,” Vanessa murmured, running her fingers through Lucas’s hair. “You promised me, Lucas. Don’t chicken out now,”.

Lucas sighed, pulling Vanessa closer. “I know that, but… it’s her birthday today, Nessa. Can’t it wait?”

Vanessa's eyes narrowed as the corner of her lips lifted into a sneer. “And also, mine, in case you’ve forgotten. So, consider it my birthday gift… it has to be today. Trust me, it’s better this way,”.

The hallways spun under my feet and my vision blurred, my mind reeling as the words I just heard sank in. I stumbled back from the door, my heart shattering into a thousand pieces.

“I’m getting cheated on and rejected on the same day as my birthday,” I whispered to myself as tears rolled down my cheeks “Thank you, moon goddess, a perfect way to start my 18th…,”.

\~\~\~24 Hours Earlier\~\~\~

I was known as the child who killed her mother at birth…

But if you’re kind enough and want to call me by my name, then it’s Lily…Lily Stone.

I was lounging at the small window of my room which was the attic of the Golden Moon Packhouse, gazing out at the lush forest that bordered the pack lands. The evening sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, a beautiful sight that usually uplifts my spirits but today I felt empty.

Tomorrow, was my 18th birthday, a day that should be filled with excitement and celebration. Instead, a familiar sense of dread settled in my stomach.

I turned away from the window, my eyes falling on the small calendar on my desk. Two birthdays were circled in red: mine and my sister Vanessa’s. I was so unfortunate to be born on the same birth date as Vanessa and one would think we would be sharing our special day. When in reality, Vanessa’s birthday always overshadowed mine.

No one even remembers that I was born that day. No gifts, not even a birthday song.

Sighing, I ran my hand through my long, chestnut hair. Wondering what it would be like to have a normal family. One that cared about me. But that was a luxury, I’d never know.

My father, Alpha Gregory Stone had never shown me an ounce of affection; but it was understandable since his mate had died protecting me. And Vanessa? Well, sisterly love was not in her vocabulary.

To her, I was as good as one of the Omegas that served in the pack house.

A soft chime from my phone pulled me out of my thoughts. My heart pulsated with happiness when I saw it was a message from Lucas my boyfriend. If there was one bright spot in my miserable life, it was him. Lucas had been my rock – he was the son of the Pack’s Gamma but rather than bullying me like every other person did, he was the only one who extended a hand of friendship to me and since then… our love had grown into a deep bond.

My hands flew over my phone as I responded to his greeting.

“Hi, Can’t wait to see you tomorrow. What time are you coming?”

I held my breath, waiting for his response. We had a big fight a few days ago, it was a miracle we were still talking to each other. My heart fluttered with warmth when I noticed that he had read the message immediately and was typing back. Even if I had no one to rely on, even if my family seemed to forget my existence including the entire pack, on days like tomorrow, I rely on Lucas.

“Might run a bit late. I have something to take care of first. But I’ll be there, I promise,” he replied.

A small frown creased my forehead as I stared at his message. “Is everything okay?” I typed back quickly.

“Yeah, don’t worry—just some stuff to take care of. I’ve got plans for us,” he replied again.

A small smile tugged at my lips as I sighed with relief. Lucas always prepared something small and intimate for my birthdays. He was the only person that made me feel seen, who made my birthday feel like it mattered.

“Okay, no problem,” I typed back attaching a lot of emojis. “Looking forward to it!”.

I set my phone down and flopped onto my bed, staring at the ceiling. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off with Lucas lately. We’ve fought more this month than we had in all the years of our relationship and it was over very insignificant issues.

He was becoming more distant these days. His messages were shorter and less frequent and it took him hours to reply every time I brought it up, he would assure me everything was fine or he would say I was obsessing too much over him.

“Stop it!” I muttered to myself. “You’re just being paranoid,”.

I have to give Lucas a break… as a son of our Pack’s Gamma, the beam was on him now that he was an adult. Naturally, everyone expects that he would take over the reins once his father retires, so, I would cut him some slack.

I decided to go downstairs. I had intentionally avoided going there today since the entire Pack House buzzed with activity. The preparations were for Vanessa’s 18th birthday.

As I crept down the stairs, voices drifted from the living room - the unmistakable voice of my father and Vanessa’s pretty high-pitched laughter.

“Sweetheart, you’re going to love your gift,” he said, his voice warm with affection. “I can’t wait to see your face when you open it,”.

I inched closer, peering from the doorway. My stomach twisted with jealousy and sadness as I saw my father sitting on the couch, his arms draped casually around Vanessa’s shoulders. She was curled against him, staring at him with adoring eyes. On the coffee table, was a large wrapped, gift box tied with an elegant bow.

“Daddy!” her delighted squeal filled the air “You shouldn’t have. You’ve done enough already,”.

“Nonsense, Nessa,” he chuckled pressing a kiss on her forehead. “My little girl only turns 19 once and you deserve to have the best party in the history of Golden Moon Pack. Plus, you deserve to be spoiled. You’re royalty,”.

Tears gathered in my eyes as I stared at Alpha Gregory… Our father… I’ve never heard him speak to me with such tenderness. Swallowing hard, I stepped into the living room. They both looked up as I entered and immediately, their smiles faded.

“Lily,” he said, his voice suddenly cold. “What are you doing down here? Didn’t I tell you to remain in your room today? I don’t want you to be in the way of the decorators,”.

I fought the urge to roll my eyes. “I was just getting some water,”.

“Well, hurry up and get back to your room. I don’t want you touching anything or ruining something. By the way, I was just telling Vanessa about her birthday party tomorrow, here at the pack house,”.

Vanessa smirked, tossing her perfect hair over her shoulder. “It’s going to be amazing. Everyone who’s anyone will be there,”.

I stood frozen, suddenly feeling like an intruder. “Oh,” I managed to say. “That sounds … nice,”.

I watched as the Alpha’s expression hardened. Fixing me a cold stare, he said: “I want to make something clear, Lily. Tomorrow’s party is for Vanessa. I don’t want you showing up and causing any … disturbances,”.

The words hit me like a physical blow. I knew my father didn’t care much for me, but to be explicitly uninvited to a party on my birthday? That was a new low.

Vanessa’s eyes glittered with mockery. “Oh, don’t be so hard on her, Daddy. I’m sure Lily understands. After all, she wouldn’t want to ruin my special day, would she?”

“But…” I started; my voice small. “It’s my birthday too,”.

He waved his hand dismissively. “You know what I mean. This is Vanessa’s special day. You’ll only upset her if you’re there,”.

Vanessa nodded, a mocking sympathetic look on her face. “It’s just… you know how you are, Lily. Always so awkward. It would ruin the mood,”.

The patronizing tone made my blood boil. I wanted to retort and remind them that they made me this way. They made it impossible for me to belong to this pack. From working like a slave in the pack house to Vanessa constantly picking on me with her friends.

So, if I was awkward, it was because of them.

I felt tears pricking at my eyes but I refused to let them fall. I wouldn’t give them the satisfaction. Instead, I lifted my chin, meeting my father’s cold gaze.

“Fine!” I said my voice steadier than I had expected. “I’ll stay in my room and make sure I won’t be in your way. So, happy birthday dearest sister, in advance of course, since I will be making extra effort not to ruin your day. And just so you know, I have plans with Lucas… so, I’ll be busy too,”.

“Don’t be like that, Lily,” she snickered “I would have wished you a happy birthday but, you shouldn’t have been born in the first place and on my birthday of all days. I wish you were never born,”.

Vanessa always looks for new ways to make me feel less of myself but thankfully, I’ve grown a thick skin.

So, I didn’t say anything in reply, I simply flashed her a defiant smile and murmured under my breath as I left.

“I don’t care about your stupid party anyway! I have Lucas!”

# Chapter 2

Lily POV

I trudged back to my room, my father’s cold words and Vanessa’s smirk still echoing in my mind. I was used to their ill-treatment. I should be used to it, but every time they spoke to me like this, the sting of their words would pierce through my heart, leaving me miserable.

Collapsing onto my bed, I closed my eyes, allowing myself to drift into fantasies of having the best birthday ever tomorrow – one where Lucas would make me feel special and loved.

I had barely settled into the dream when the annoying buzz of my alarm clock rang, jolting me awake. Stretching like a lazy cat, I stared at the wall opposite me for a few minutes, I couldn’t believe I was 18 today. Instead of excitement, a familiar weight settled in my chest.

No one cared that I was 18 today…

Also, I had to make breakfast for my father and Vanessa and do other chores… it didn’t matter that today was my birthday.

Dragging myself out of bed, I made my way to the kitchen. Since no one was up, I had the pack house to myself for a few minutes.

About time,” Vanessa sneered as she sauntered into the kitchen, shattering my peaceful moment and my daydreaming. She looked dressed up. “I’m starving,”.

A second later, Alpha Gregory came down too, and walked straight to Vanessa ignoring my ‘Good morning Dad,”.

“Happy birthday princess!” he exclaimed, placing a glittering tiara on Vanessa’s perfectly styled hair. “We party hard tonight,”.

Vanessa squealed with delight as she ran to the mirror in the hallway to check the tiara, then came back panting. “Oh, Daddy, it’s beautiful. You’re the best,”.

Alpha Gregory barely spared me a glance as he settled onto his side of the table and picked up the morning paper. After reading for a while, he looked up at me. The first glance he was giving me since he came downstairs.

“Don’t forget to clean up before you leave,” He said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

“Yes, Dad,” I nodded silently watching as they ate their breakfast. I would eat later after they finish.

After eating they both left the house. Finally, alone, I cleared the table and ate one hard, boiled egg before going back to my room. I retrieved the dress I’d been saving up for months to buy.

Since I didn’t have an allowance like Vanessa, I had to save up the little pennies I scraped from going to the market and running errands around the pack for me. The dress was a beautiful emerald green that brought out the gold flecks in my hazel eyes. Slipping it on, I stood before the mirror, admiring how it hugged my curves.

For a brief moment, I imagined myself as beautiful as Vanessa. My sister was the belle of the pack. She was tall… without being too tall and slender with the right amount of cheekbones, colour of eyes and beautiful hair. She always drew eyes wherever she went. Me on the other hand, my chestnut curly hair was hard to tame, despite everything I had done, my hazel eyes and freckled face made me look like I had existed in the dragon age and it didn’t help that I was fat.

I had bigger boobs, bigger butts and wider hips that I have to always hide with big clothes. I looked like a boar compared to Vanessa who was as beautiful as a gazelle and carried herself well. People often told me I looked like my mother – my father’s mate who had died shortly after giving birth to me. The very reason why my dad – Alpha Gregory hates me. To him, I killed his mate.

Studying my reflection, I felt a pang of longing. I wished I had known my mother, maybe I could have experienced the love and acceptance I’d always craved and maybe my father would hate me less.

I styled my stubborn hair and applied light makeup from the products Vanessa had thrown away last month because another Alpha’s daughter from school told her they didn’t match her skin tone. Satisfied with my little touchup, I headed downstairs.

The house was already bustling with activity. Decorators rushed in and out, shouting instructions to each other, hanging streamers and arranging flowers. The party was supposed to start in the evening and it was only noon, I wondered why they were all freaking out.

The delicious aroma of freshly baked cake wafted from the kitchen to my nose and for a moment, I allowed myself to imagine it was all for me.

Exhaling, I started for me Lucas’s secret spot – a small clearing in the woods near the border of the pack lands. It was when Lucas first asked me to be his girlfriend when we’d shared our first kiss. Surely, he would make this birthday special.

My stomach fluttered with excitement when I arrived at the clearing expecting to see some decorations but nothing was there and there was no sign of Lucas too. Maybe he got caught up with something besides, it’s the thoughts that matter and not decoration. I told myself.

Minutes ticked into hours… and the initial excitement turned to worry. Lucas was never late, not for our meetings. Four hours passed and there was no sign of him. By now, I know the pack house will be filled to the brim with people for the party.

One more hour later, it was dark already and I couldn’t bear waiting any longer. With a heavy heart, I left the secret spot and started heading home. Lucas must have been so busy. As I approached the pack house, the sounds of music and laughter grew louder, a stark reminder of the celebration I wasn’t part of.

“I’ll just go to my room, change into something casual and go check up on Lucas,” I murmured to myself.

“Isn’t that the other ‘weird sister’ – Lily Stone,” someone announced with a microphone, making me freeze. When I turned, it was Vanessa’s group of friends. They came towards me immediately, flanking me on all sides, making it difficult for me to continue to my room.

The others laughed, their eyes roving over my dress with disdain. Since I’d been caught, there was no need to hide now. “I know you all are dumb but I didn’t know you’d be dumb enough not to figure that I live here too…and that means I can come and go as I please. If your alcohol bedazzled minds had allowed you to think, you’d have noticed that I was heading upstairs, to my room,”.

“Wow!” the girls exclaimed in unison, clapping, still laughing “What’s making you so brazen today? Is it the new age?” one of them asked.

“It should be the dress,” one of them pointed out.

“I wonder what charity home she had to go pick this up from. You should swing by my house later, I have lots of clothes that are ten times better than what you’re wearing. Consider it, a gesture to help a destitute like you,”.

“Wouldn’t that make me as dumb as you, Aria?” I recognized her. She was the Beta’s daughter. “I heard you’d need to retake sophomore year for the third time in a row. “That’s too bad dear… all your friends would have graduated and left before you ever caught up,” I retorted with a smile.

Aria scoffed with annoyance. I could see that my words had gone right through her. The other girls snickered, each one of them looking away. Aria scoffed and folded her hands, looking at me with mockery.

“At least my boyfriend didn’t desert me to attend my sister’s birthday party instead,” she said

My heart pricked with fear at her words. It could only mean one thing… Lucas had come to the party just like I suspected. Ignoring the taunts, I pushed past them. I had more important things to worry about now – finding Lucas.

I searched the crowded living room, the kitchen, and even the backyard but Lucas was nowhere to be seen. With each passing minute, the knot in my stomach tightened. Where could he be? Why didn’t he just tell me he was at Vanessa’s party? It was probably his father that forced him to attend.

As a last resort, I headed upstairs. The second floor was off-limits for the party, but I thought Lucas might have gone up to escape the noise. He hated parties just like me. But as I passed by Vanessa’s room, my ears caught muffled voices from within.

I paused for a while, hoping I wasn’t hearing things. There was no way the celebrant of the party would be in her room when the party was just starting. But it wouldn’t hurt to check.

My hand hovered over the doorknob, hesitating. Then I heard it – Lucas’s laugh, followed by Vanessa’s sultry giggle. My blood ran cold. I pressed my ears against the door.

“You should just reject her, Lucas,” Vanessa’s voice came through now. “She’s no good for you. We’d be so much stronger together. My wolf is more powerful unlike her who has no wolf and to the best of my knowledge, she didn’t get any today and you know what it means when someone doesn’t get their wolf on their 18th birthday. Think about it, Lucas, you could be the next Alpha if we mate,”.

My heart pounded in my chest, as my ears strained to hear Lucas’s response.

“I know, I know!” he replied, his voice low and husky. “But I’ve been with Lily for three years. I can’t just dump her, especially on her birthday of all days. It’ll break her. So, we need to take this slow and easy… be smart about it. I wasn’t planning on ending up with her anyways,”.

A gasp escaped my lips before I could stop it. I stumbled backwards, bumping into a small table in the hallway. The vase on top wobbled and crashed to the floor, shattering into a thousand pieces.

The voices in the room went silent. Moments later, the door flew open and Vanessa stood there, her perfect hair slightly mussed, wearing nothing but a silky robe. Behind her, Lucas scrambled to pull on his shirt, his face pale with shock.

“Well, well,” Vanessa drawled, clapping as a cruel smile spread across her face. “Look what we have here. Lily, the little spy,”.

I stood frozen, my eyes darting between Vanessa and Lucas. “How…how could you?” I whispered to him, my voice breaking.

He stepped forwards raising his hands placatingly. “Willow, I can explain -,”.

“Oh, stop it, Lucas,” Vanessa cut him off, rolling her eyes. “No more pretending please. Let’s just put her out of her misery… she deserves to know the truth,”.

Then she turned to me “Did you think he could ever truly want you? Look at you – no wolf, no power, nothing to offer. You’re pathetic, Lily. Always have been, always will be,”.

“Lucas, please,” I pleaded, tears streaming down my face. “Tell me it’s not true. We love each other, don’t we?”

But Lucas couldn’t meet my eyes. “I’m sorry, Lily. I never meant for you to find out like this,”.

Vanessa laughed, “Oh, this is rich. Did you believe he loves you? Wake up little sister. You were just a placeholder until something better came along,”.

The room spun but I refused to believe this was happening. Perhaps, he was under duress, Vanessa had a way to make anyone do what she wanted.

Vanessa then turned to Lucas. “You know what you need to do now, don’t you? It’s time to end this charade once and for all,”.

I saw him hesitate his eyes darting between me and Vanessa. Suddenly, I saw the moment his resolve hardened, and my heart shattered.

“Do it!” Vanessa urged. “Reject her, right now!”

Time slowed as he stepped towards me. I wanted to run, to hide… anything to delay the blow I was about to receive but my feet felt rooted to the spot. I watched, as if from a great distance as Lucas’s lips moved…

“I, Lucas Steele, reject you, Lily Stone as my mate,”.

The pain was immediate and overwhelming, I felt like my soul was being torn apart. I gasped, clutching at my chest as the agony of his rejection coursed through my body. I stumbled to the ground, fighting the darkness that slowly enclosed me.

The last thing I saw before the darkness claimed me was Vanessa’s triumphant smile.

Then… black out.

Vanessa's eyes narrowed as the corner of her lips lifted into a sneer. “And also, mine, in case you’ve forgotten. So, consider it my birthday gift… it has to be today. Trust me, it’s better this way,”.

The hallways spun under my feet and my vision blurred, my mind reeling as the words I just heard sank in. I stumbled back from the door, my heart shattering into a thousand pieces.

“I’m getting cheated on and rejected on the same day as my birthday,” I whispered to myself as tears rolled down my cheeks “Thank you, moon goddess, a perfect way to start my 18th…,”.

\~\~\~24 Hours Earlier\~\~\~

I was known as the child who killed her mother at birth…

But if you’re kind enough and want to call me by my name, then it’s Lily…Lily Stone.

I was lounging at the small window of my room which was the attic of the Golden Moon Packhouse, gazing out at the lush forest that bordered the pack lands. The evening sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, a beautiful sight that usually uplifts my spirits but today I felt empty.

Tomorrow, was my 18th birthday, a day that should be filled with excitement and celebration. Instead, a familiar sense of dread settled in my stomach.

I turned away from the window, my eyes falling on the small calendar on my desk. Two birthdays were circled in red: mine and my sister Vanessa’s. I was so unfortunate to be born on the same birth date as Vanessa and one would think we would be sharing our special day. When in reality, Vanessa’s birthday always overshadowed mine.

No one even remembers that I was born that day. No gifts, not even a birthday song.

Sighing, I ran my hand through my long, chestnut hair. Wondering what it would be like to have a normal family. One that cared about me. But that was a luxury, I’d never know.

My father, Alpha Gregory Stone had never shown me an ounce of affection; but it was understandable since his mate had died protecting me. And Vanessa? Well, sisterly love was not in her vocabulary.

To her, I was as good as one of the Omegas that served in the pack house.

A soft chime from my phone pulled me out of my thoughts. My heart pulsated with happiness when I saw it was a message from Lucas my boyfriend. If there was one bright spot in my miserable life, it was him. Lucas had been my rock – he was the son of the Pack’s Gamma but rather than bullying me like every other person did, he was the only one who extended a hand of friendship to me and since then… our love had grown into a deep bond.

My hands flew over my phone as I responded to his greeting.

“Hi, Can’t wait to see you tomorrow. What time are you coming?”

I held my breath, waiting for his response. We had a big fight a few days ago, it was a miracle we were still talking to each other. My heart fluttered with warmth when I noticed that he had read the message immediately and was typing back. Even if I had no one to rely on, even if my family seemed to forget my existence including the entire pack, on days like tomorrow, I rely on Lucas.

“Might run a bit late. I have something to take care of first. But I’ll be there, I promise,” he replied.

A small frown creased my forehead as I stared at his message. “Is everything okay?” I typed back quickly.

“Yeah, don’t worry—just some stuff to take care of. I’ve got plans for us,” he replied again.

A small smile tugged at my lips as I sighed with relief. Lucas always prepared something small and intimate for my birthdays. He was the only person that made me feel seen, who made my birthday feel like it mattered.

“Okay, no problem,” I typed back attaching a lot of emojis. “Looking forward to it!”.

I set my phone down and flopped onto my bed, staring at the ceiling. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off with Lucas lately. We’ve fought more this month than we had in all the years of our relationship and it was over very insignificant issues.

He was becoming more distant these days. His messages were shorter and less frequent and it took him hours to reply every time I brought it up, he would assure me everything was fine or he would say I was obsessing too much over him.

“Stop it!” I muttered to myself. “You’re just being paranoid,”.

I have to give Lucas a break… as a son of our Pack’s Gamma, the beam was on him now that he was an adult. Naturally, everyone expects that he would take over the reins once his father retires, so, I would cut him some slack.

I decided to go downstairs. I had intentionally avoided going there today since the entire Pack House buzzed with activity. The preparations were for Vanessa’s 18th birthday.

As I crept down the stairs, voices drifted from the living room - the unmistakable voice of my father and Vanessa’s pretty high-pitched laughter.

“Sweetheart, you’re going to love your gift,” he said, his voice warm with affection. “I can’t wait to see your face when you open it,”.

I inched closer, peering from the doorway. My stomach twisted with jealousy and sadness as I saw my father sitting on the couch, his arms draped casually around Vanessa’s shoulders. She was curled against him, staring at him with adoring eyes. On the coffee table, was a large wrapped, gift box tied with an elegant bow.

“Daddy!” her delighted squeal filled the air “You shouldn’t have. You’ve done enough already,”.

“Nonsense, Nessa,” he chuckled pressing a kiss on her forehead. “My little girl only turns 19 once and you deserve to have the best party in the history of Golden Moon Pack. Plus, you deserve to be spoiled. You’re royalty,”.

Tears gathered in my eyes as I stared at Alpha Gregory… Our father… I’ve never heard him speak to me with such tenderness. Swallowing hard, I stepped into the living room. They both looked up as I entered and immediately, their smiles faded.

“Lily,” he said, his voice suddenly cold. “What are you doing down here? Didn’t I tell you to remain in your room today? I don’t want you to be in the way of the decorators,”.

I fought the urge to roll my eyes. “I was just getting some water,”.

“Well, hurry up and get back to your room. I don’t want you touching anything or ruining something. By the way, I was just telling Vanessa about her birthday party tomorrow, here at the pack house,”.

Vanessa smirked, tossing her perfect hair over her shoulder. “It’s going to be amazing. Everyone who’s anyone will be there,”.

I stood frozen, suddenly feeling like an intruder. “Oh,” I managed to say. “That sounds … nice,”.

I watched as the Alpha’s expression hardened. Fixing me a cold stare, he said: “I want to make something clear, Lily. Tomorrow’s party is for Vanessa. I don’t want you showing up and causing any … disturbances,”.

The words hit me like a physical blow. I knew my father didn’t care much for me, but to be explicitly uninvited to a party on my birthday? That was a new low.

Vanessa’s eyes glittered with mockery. “Oh, don’t be so hard on her, Daddy. I’m sure Lily understands. After all, she wouldn’t want to ruin my special day, would she?”

“But…” I started; my voice small. “It’s my birthday too,”.

He waved his hand dismissively. “You know what I mean. This is Vanessa’s special day. You’ll only upset her if you’re there,”.

Vanessa nodded, a mocking sympathetic look on her face. “It’s just… you know how you are, Lily. Always so awkward. It would ruin the mood,”.

The patronizing tone made my blood boil. I wanted to retort and remind them that they made me this way. They made it impossible for me to belong to this pack. From working like a slave in the pack house to Vanessa constantly picking on me with her friends.

So, if I was awkward, it was because of them.

I felt tears pricking at my eyes but I refused to let them fall. I wouldn’t give them the satisfaction. Instead, I lifted my chin, meeting my father’s cold gaze.

“Fine!” I said my voice steadier than I had expected. “I’ll stay in my room and make sure I won’t be in your way. So, happy birthday dearest sister, in advance of course, since I will be making extra effort not to ruin your day. And just so you know, I have plans with Lucas… so, I’ll be busy too,”.

“Don’t be like that, Lily,” she snickered “I would have wished you a happy birthday but, you shouldn’t have been born in the first place and on my birthday of all days. I wish you were never born,”.

Vanessa always looks for new ways to make me feel less of myself but thankfully, I’ve grown a thick skin.

So, I didn’t say anything in reply, I simply flashed her a defiant smile and murmured under my breath as I left.

“I don’t care about your stupid party anyway! I have Lucas!”

# Chapter 2

Lily POV

I trudged back to my room, my father’s cold words and Vanessa’s smirk still echoing in my mind. I was used to their ill-treatment. I should be used to it, but every time they spoke to me like this, the sting of their words would pierce through my heart, leaving me miserable.

Collapsing onto my bed, I closed my eyes, allowing myself to drift into fantasies of having the best birthday ever tomorrow – one where Lucas would make me feel special and loved.

I had barely settled into the dream when the annoying buzz of my alarm clock rang, jolting me awake. Stretching like a lazy cat, I stared at the wall opposite me for a few minutes, I couldn’t believe I was 18 today. Instead of excitement, a familiar weight settled in my chest.

No one cared that I was 18 today…

Also, I had to make breakfast for my father and Vanessa and do other chores… it didn’t matter that today was my birthday.

Dragging myself out of bed, I made my way to the kitchen. Since no one was up, I had the pack house to myself for a few minutes.

About time,” Vanessa sneered as she sauntered into the kitchen, shattering my peaceful moment and my daydreaming. She looked dressed up. “I’m starving,”.

A second later, Alpha Gregory came down too, and walked straight to Vanessa ignoring my ‘Good morning Dad,”.

“Happy birthday princess!” he exclaimed, placing a glittering tiara on Vanessa’s perfectly styled hair. “We party hard tonight,”.

Vanessa squealed with delight as she ran to the mirror in the hallway to check the tiara, then came back panting. “Oh, Daddy, it’s beautiful. You’re the best,”.

Alpha Gregory barely spared me a glance as he settled onto his side of the table and picked up the morning paper. After reading for a while, he looked up at me. The first glance he was giving me since he came downstairs.

“Don’t forget to clean up before you leave,” He said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

“Yes, Dad,” I nodded silently watching as they ate their breakfast. I would eat later after they finish.

After eating they both left the house. Finally, alone, I cleared the table and ate one hard, boiled egg before going back to my room. I retrieved the dress I’d been saving up for months to buy.

Since I didn’t have an allowance like Vanessa, I had to save up the little pennies I scraped from going to the market and running errands around the pack for me. The dress was a beautiful emerald green that brought out the gold flecks in my hazel eyes. Slipping it on, I stood before the mirror, admiring how it hugged my curves.

For a brief moment, I imagined myself as beautiful as Vanessa. My sister was the belle of the pack. She was tall… without being too tall and slender with the right amount of cheekbones, colour of eyes and beautiful hair. She always drew eyes wherever she went. Me on the other hand, my chestnut curly hair was hard to tame, despite everything I had done, my hazel eyes and freckled face made me look like I had existed in the dragon age and it didn’t help that I was fat.

I had bigger boobs, bigger butts and wider hips that I have to always hide with big clothes. I looked like a boar compared to Vanessa who was as beautiful as a gazelle and carried herself well. People often told me I looked like my mother – my father’s mate who had died shortly after giving birth to me. The very reason why my dad – Alpha Gregory hates me. To him, I killed his mate.

Studying my reflection, I felt a pang of longing. I wished I had known my mother, maybe I could have experienced the love and acceptance I’d always craved and maybe my father would hate me less.

I styled my stubborn hair and applied light makeup from the products Vanessa had thrown away last month because another Alpha’s daughter from school told her they didn’t match her skin tone. Satisfied with my little touchup, I headed downstairs.

The house was already bustling with activity. Decorators rushed in and out, shouting instructions to each other, hanging streamers and arranging flowers. The party was supposed to start in the evening and it was only noon, I wondered why they were all freaking out.

The delicious aroma of freshly baked cake wafted from the kitchen to my nose and for a moment, I allowed myself to imagine it was all for me.

Exhaling, I started for me Lucas’s secret spot – a small clearing in the woods near the border of the pack lands. It was when Lucas first asked me to be his girlfriend when we’d shared our first kiss. Surely, he would make this birthday special.

My stomach fluttered with excitement when I arrived at the clearing expecting to see some decorations but nothing was there and there was no sign of Lucas too. Maybe he got caught up with something besides, it’s the thoughts that matter and not decoration. I told myself.

Minutes ticked into hours… and the initial excitement turned to worry. Lucas was never late, not for our meetings. Four hours passed and there was no sign of him. By now, I know the pack house will be filled to the brim with people for the party.

One more hour later, it was dark already and I couldn’t bear waiting any longer. With a heavy heart, I left the secret spot and started heading home. Lucas must have been so busy. As I approached the pack house, the sounds of music and laughter grew louder, a stark reminder of the celebration I wasn’t part of.

“I’ll just go to my room, change into something casual and go check up on Lucas,” I murmured to myself.

“Isn’t that the other ‘weird sister’ – Lily Stone,” someone announced with a microphone, making me freeze. When I turned, it was Vanessa’s group of friends. They came towards me immediately, flanking me on all sides, making it difficult for me to continue to my room.

The others laughed, their eyes roving over my dress with disdain. Since I’d been caught, there was no need to hide now. “I know you all are dumb but I didn’t know you’d be dumb enough not to figure that I live here too…and that means I can come and go as I please. If your alcohol bedazzled minds had allowed you to think, you’d have noticed that I was heading upstairs, to my room,”.

“Wow!” the girls exclaimed in unison, clapping, still laughing “What’s making you so brazen today? Is it the new age?” one of them asked.

“It should be the dress,” one of them pointed out.

“I wonder what charity home she had to go pick this up from. You should swing by my house later, I have lots of clothes that are ten times better than what you’re wearing. Consider it, a gesture to help a destitute like you,”.

“Wouldn’t that make me as dumb as you, Aria?” I recognized her. She was the Beta’s daughter. “I heard you’d need to retake sophomore year for the third time in a row. “That’s too bad dear… all your friends would have graduated and left before you ever caught up,” I retorted with a smile.

Aria scoffed with annoyance. I could see that my words had gone right through her. The other girls snickered, each one of them looking away. Aria scoffed and folded her hands, looking at me with mockery.

“At least my boyfriend didn’t desert me to attend my sister’s birthday party instead,” she said

My heart pricked with fear at her words. It could only mean one thing… Lucas had come to the party just like I suspected. Ignoring the taunts, I pushed past them. I had more important things to worry about now – finding Lucas.

I searched the crowded living room, the kitchen, and even the backyard but Lucas was nowhere to be seen. With each passing minute, the knot in my stomach tightened. Where could he be? Why didn’t he just tell me he was at Vanessa’s party? It was probably his father that forced him to attend.

As a last resort, I headed upstairs. The second floor was off-limits for the party, but I thought Lucas might have gone up to escape the noise. He hated parties just like me. But as I passed by Vanessa’s room, my ears caught muffled voices from within.

I paused for a while, hoping I wasn’t hearing things. There was no way the celebrant of the party would be in her room when the party was just starting. But it wouldn’t hurt to check.

My hand hovered over the doorknob, hesitating. Then I heard it – Lucas’s laugh, followed by Vanessa’s sultry giggle. My blood ran cold. I pressed my ears against the door.

“You should just reject her, Lucas,” Vanessa’s voice came through now. “She’s no good for you. We’d be so much stronger together. My wolf is more powerful unlike her who has no wolf and to the best of my knowledge, she didn’t get any today and you know what it means when someone doesn’t get their wolf on their 18th birthday. Think about it, Lucas, you could be the next Alpha if we mate,”.

My heart pounded in my chest, as my ears strained to hear Lucas’s response.

“I know, I know!” he replied, his voice low and husky. “But I’ve been with Lily for three years. I can’t just dump her, especially on her birthday of all days. It’ll break her. So, we need to take this slow and easy… be smart about it. I wasn’t planning on ending up with her anyways,”.

A gasp escaped my lips before I could stop it. I stumbled backwards, bumping into a small table in the hallway. The vase on top wobbled and crashed to the floor, shattering into a thousand pieces.

The voices in the room went silent. Moments later, the door flew open and Vanessa stood there, her perfect hair slightly mussed, wearing nothing but a silky robe. Behind her, Lucas scrambled to pull on his shirt, his face pale with shock.

“Well, well,” Vanessa drawled, clapping as a cruel smile spread across her face. “Look what we have here. Lily, the little spy,”.

I’m talking toxic culture, broken engineering practices, and career dead-ends disguised as jobs, ie. nearly half of the jobs out there. 

Martin Fowler once said: *“Change your company, or change your company.”* I take that as: fix it if you can, or leave before it eats you alive.

My breakdown of the main types of crap we deal with:

* **Shitty culture?** Unfixable. Bail.
* **Shitty engineering practices?** Maybe fixable—depends on where you are in your career.
* **Shitty growth opportunities?** Set a six-month timer and be brutally honest about progress.

I wrote this half as therapy and half as a warning. If you've ever stuck around too long, or tried to fix something that couldn't be fixed, I think it'll resonate.

Two questions for you: 

1. have you ever actually *fixed* a toxic situation from the inside?
2. when do *you* decide it’s time to walk away?

BOOK ONE: FLAMES OF LOVE

January, 2018

Jaxson Anderson pushed the plate-glass door open, the overhead bell tinkling, announcing his entrance. The warmth, the yeast and sugar smell...it rushed over him, surrounding him, and he almost stopped dead in his tracks, wanting to do nothing but breathe it all in. He hadn't been in an honest-to-God bakery in ages, and had forgotten how damn delicious they smelled.

Before he could make a real ass out of himself by literally drooling just from the smell alone, though, a head popped up from behind the front counter. A cute brunette, her hair in a braid flopped over her shoulder, shot him a smile. ""Welcome to the Muffin Man,"" she called out, pushing some stray tendrils out of her face with the back of her hand. ""You been in here before?""

He'd hardly been in the town of Sawyer more than a couple of hours. ""Nope, first time here,"" he said as he walked closer to the front display case, and the adorable brunette behind it. She looked a little younger than him, with wide, innocent eyes that made her appear even younger as she peered up at him.

She was this tiny little thing that he was sure he could tuck under his arm and run with down the football field. Between her tiny stature and her wide eyes, she gave off the impression that she was twelve.

Except...he gulped. Those curves. No 12-year-old girl had those curves.

""Well then, an extra welcome!"" she said, sending him another dizzying smile. ""I'm glad you stopped by. Are you a...tourist?"" She looked a little puzzled at that idea, giving him a quick up-and-down glance.

No, he probably didn't look a damn thing like a tourist. Most fire chiefs didn't.

""Just new in town,"" he told her. ""What is good he - Sugar?!"" he said. He was staring straight at her delectable chest.

Which was probably not his best move. He knew he was being rude, but hey, she was the one who'd pinned her name tag on it. ""Your name is Sugar?!""

She rolled her eyes at him, which now that he was close enough, he could see they were a deep brown color. Like the color of the chocolate cake sitting in the display case between them. ""Don't bother making a joke,"" she told him pertly. ""I've heard every one of them that is funny, and a whole lot that aren't. I promise you, you won't be original.""

He leaned on the clear glass goodies counter, content for a moment to ignore the copious amounts of sugar underneath his arms, and instead focus on the Sugar in front of him. ""So...basically, your parents hated you.""

""Pretty much!"" she said cheerfully, shooting him a laughing grin. Right then, a guy came through the swinging doors from the back, and Jaxson nodded towards him.

""Is his name Flour?"" he asked dryly.

""No, but I like how you think!"" Sugar looked over at her co-worker and laughed. ""Gage, he thinks you ought to change your name to Flour!""

Gage looked up from off-loading a batch of muffins into a side display case. ""Hey, my parents didn't hate me,"" he drawled in a deep voice, proving that he'd overheard their discussion. ""Don't drag me into this.""

""I think I'm gonna start calling you Muffin,"" Sugar mused, shooting her co-worker a grin. ""Or maybe Baby Cakes.""

Gage rolled his eyes. ""That's just what this town needs to hear,"" he grumbled and disappeared into the back, carrying his empty tray with him.

""Woke up on the wrong side of the bed,"" Sugar said in way of explanation, complete with a shrug, as she turned back to Jaxson. ""So, what can I get for you? Coffee? Donuts? A...muffin, perhaps?"" Her voice was a little too innocent.

Jaxson's eyes shot up to hers. Was she teasing?

Her eyes were glinting with mischief. She was.

""I was thinking that I might be in the mood for some baby cakes,"" he said, his tone as innocent as hers. She burst out laughing.

""I think I like you,"" she said, shooting him a wide grin after she caught her breath.

""You'd like me even more if I had some coffee and a donut in me,"" he informed her. ""I'm a lot more fun to be around when I'm awake.""

""Even more fun?"" she echoed, wrinkling her nose as she turned to grab a to-go cup. ""Damn. I'm not sure if I can handle that much fun. Maybe I shouldn't get your coffee after all.""

""Never come between a man and his coffee,"" he intoned, only three-quarters joking.

More like half, really.

""Fair enough,"" she said, filling the cup from the dispenser. Tendrils of steam encircled her hand and then melted away. ""So what brings you to Sawyer, if you're not a tourist?""

She turned back around, deftly grabbing a lid and pushing it into place even as she was sliding the cup across the counter to him.

He hadn't been in an honest-to-God bakery in ages, and had forgotten how damn delicious they smelled.

Before he could make a real ass out of himself by literally drooling just from the smell alone, though, a head popped up from behind the front counter. A cute brunette, her hair in a braid flopped over her shoulder, shot him a smile. ""Welcome to the Muffin Man,"" she called out, pushing some stray tendrils out of her face with the back of her hand. ""You been in here before?""

He'd hardly been in the town of Sawyer more than a couple of hours. ""Nope, first time here,"" he said as he walked closer to the front display case, and the adorable brunette behind it. She looked a little younger than him, with wide, innocent eyes that made her appear even younger as she peered up at him.

She was this tiny little thing that he was sure he could tuck under his arm and run with down the football field. Between her tiny stature and her wide eyes, she gave off the impression that she was twelve.

Except...he gulped. Those curves. No 12-year-old girl had those curves.

""Well then, an extra welcome!"" she said, sending him another dizzying smile. ""I'm glad you stopped by. Are you a...tourist?"" She looked a little puzzled at that idea, giving him a quick up-and-down glance.

No, he probably didn't look a damn thing like a tourist. Most fire chiefs didn't.

""Just new in town,"" he told her. ""What is good he - Sugar?!"" he said. He was staring straight at her delectable chest.

Which was probably not his best move. He knew he was being rude, but hey, she was the one who'd pinned her name tag on it. ""Your name is Sugar?!""

She rolled her eyes at him, which now that he was close enough, he could see they were a deep brown color. Like the color of the chocolate cake sitting in the display case between them. ""Don't bother making a joke,"" she told him pertly. ""I've heard every one of them that is funny, and a whole lot that aren't. I promise you, you won't be original.""

He leaned on the clear glass goodies counter, content for a moment to ignore the copious amounts of sugar underneath his arms, and instead focus on the Sugar in front of him. ""So...basically, your parents hated you.""

""Pretty much!"" she said cheerfully, shooting him a laughing grin. Right then, a guy came through the swinging doors from the back, and Jaxson nodded towards him.

""Is his name Flour?"" he asked dryly.

""No, but I like how you think!"" Sugar looked over at her co-worker and laughed. ""Gage, he thinks you ought to change your name to Flour!""

Gage looked up from off-loading a batch of muffins into a side display case. ""Hey, my parents didn't hate me,"" he drawled in a deep voice, proving that he'd overheard their discussion. ""Don't drag me into this.""

""I think I'm gonna start calling you Muffin,"" Sugar mused, shooting her co-worker a grin. ""Or maybe Baby Cakes.""

Gage rolled his eyes. ""That's just what this town needs to hear,"" he grumbled and disappeared into the back, carrying his empty tray with him.

""Woke up on the wrong side of the bed,"" Sugar said in way of explanation, complete with a shrug, as she turned back to Jaxson. ""So, what can I get for you? Coffee? Donuts? A...muffin, perhaps?"" Her voice was a little too innocent.

Jaxson's eyes shot up to hers. Was she teasing?

Her eyes were glinting with mischief. She was.

""I was thinking that I might be in the mood for some baby cakes,"" he said, his tone as innocent as hers. She burst out laughing.

""I think I like you,"" she said, shooting him a wide grin after she caught her breath.

""You'd like me even more if I had some coffee and a donut in me,"" he informed her. ""I'm a lot more fun to be around when I'm awake.""

""Even more fun?"" she echoed, wrinkling her nose as she turned to grab a to-go cup. ""Damn. I'm not sure if I can handle that much fun. Maybe I shouldn't get your coffee after all.""

""Never come between a man and his coffee,"" he intoned, only three-quarters joking.

More like half, really.

""Fair enough,"" she said, filling the cup from the dispenser. Tendrils of steam encircled her hand and then melted away. ""So what brings you to Sawyer, if you're not a tourist?""

She turned back around, deftly grabbing a lid and pushing it into place even as she was sliding the cup across the counter to him.",1,1746790236.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Jaxson Anderson pushed the plate-glass door open, the overhead bell tinkling, announcing his entrance. The warmth, the yeast and sugar smell...it rushed over him, surrounding him, and he almost stopped dead in his tracks, wanting to do nothing but breathe it all in. He hadn't been in an honest-to-God bakery in ages, and had forgotten how damn delicious they smelled.

This silver-accented beauty didn’t just win a spot on my counter; it carved its place in my morning ritual. From its promising 20-bar pump pressure to a compact stainless-steel design, I had high hopes—and it delivered, most of the time. However, like anything, it's not perfect, and I’d love to walk you through what stood out and what fell a little short.

**Striking Design and Build Quality**  
This espresso machine is a looker. The stainless-steel finish gives off a polished, modern vibe that meshes beautifully with my kitchen decor. Its compact build (13.19"" x 16.93"" x 7.48"") doesn't hog much counter space, which I appreciate since my kitchen's more “tiny cafe” than “chef’s paradise.” Despite the sleekness of the YASHE AZ-EM1503, the lightweight build (just under 9.4 pounds) makes it feel slightly less durable than bulkier machines I've tested. But don’t let that fool you—it still holds up well under daily use, albeit with some increased vibrations during brewing.  

**Ease of Operation for Beginners**  
What drew me initially to this espresso machine was its simplicity. The three-button operation—single shot, double shot, and steam—feels straightforward and approachable even for coffee newbies. I remember experimenting with its steam wand to froth milk for lattes and—confession alert—I might’ve been overly proud of my velvety foam art. Latte or cappuccino lovers will find themselves at ease in recreating café-style drinks. However, the plastic tamper included with the product left me wanting more; it feels flimsy when compared to the high-quality feel of the filters and portafilter.

**[Check YASHE AZ-EM1503 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dbp4kd7f/)**  

**Fast Heating and Brewing Performance**  
On busy mornings, the thermo-block heating system of this machine is a lifesaver. It preheats in a jiffy, letting me get to my much-needed espresso faster than most traditional machines. The 20-bar pressure system consistently pulled shots with robust crema, giving me the satisfaction of sipping rich, aromatic coffee. I dared to try store-bought Cuban-style grinds, and the results were spot-on. Though the overall brewing experience is excellent, the noise level of the pump—and the gentle vibrations that caused my cup to shimmy across the drip tray—did feel a tad excessive.

**Large Water Tank for Multiple Cups**  
What truly surprised me is the efficiency provided by the 37.2oz removable water tank. On weekends when everyone suddenly becomes a coffee enthusiast, this tank saves me from refilling after a few rounds of espressos and lattes. Plus, the transparent indicators make it easy to gauge water levels. While cleaning the tank is simple, I wish the initial setup instructions for priming the pump were a bit clearer. I had to improvise—using a cup to manually fill the pump valve—since the manual left me scratching my head.

**Pros**  
- The elegant design fits small kitchen spaces seamlessly.  
- High 20-bar pressure ensures espresso with impressive crema.  
- Steam wand delivers quality frothing for latte aficionados.  
- Quick heating minimizes morning hustle.  
- Transparent, removable water tank simplifies maintenance.

**Drawbacks**  
- Included plastic tamper feels below par.  
- Instructions for pump priming lacked clarity.  
- Vibrations during brewing are noticeable.

**Competitive Options**  
If you’re flirting with alternatives, the De’Longhi Dedica EC685 and Breville Bambino Plus come to mind as worthy contenders. While both brands rival this espresso maker in creating consistent brews, De’Longhi wins on a quieter operation, although it doesn’t offer as large a water tank. Meanwhile, Breville Bambino Plus has automated milk features, something absent in this machine—but you’ll pay a premium for that convenience. However, for its price, this YASHE machine thrives by providing a strong, hands-on brewing experience without breaking the bank.

**Price Worthiness**  
Does this machine deliver its bang for the buck? Personally, I think so. While pricier models pack in features like programmability and advanced thermal systems, this espresso maker thrums along as an excellent no-frills alternative. My initial expectations were exceeded, and even the cons I’ve encountered—like the vibrations—were minor inconveniences rather than dealbreakers. It’s beginner-friendly yet advanced enough for tweakers, which makes it a solid value purchase.

The story of this scene takes place on the night Amy dies.
Carl walks to Station 13 — wearing the clothes soaked in Amy’s blood:


The Narrator left, so I’ll be your voice here.
You know, you should get used to that.
Sorry I didn’t introduce myself.
I’m the writer.
Yeah… that one. The name on the cover.
I’ll keep this simple — no flourishes.
Carl goes to Station 13.
The place where he saw his beloved for the first time.
He sits on the same bench.
The bench that, no matter how you look at it, is always Bench 13 of the Station.
Symbolic, isn’t it?
But hey, I didn’t write it — I’m just reading what’s already there.
He sits on that bench and cries.
It’s past midnight.
No stars.
Even the stars were too afraid to watch Carl cry.

Suddenly, the air gets cold.
A man approaches from the distance, though you can’t see him clearly at first.
He gets closer, and now —
Wait. That man…
Damn him.
Sorry, I shouldn’t say anything yet.

He’s wearing a long gray coat and a matching gray hat.
Brown pants and shoes.
The hat’s pulled down just enough to hide his face,
but that bitter smile — that you can see.

He sits next to Carl.
Takes out a cigarette from a pack and says:

""Want one?""

Carl doesn’t respond.
Just lowers his head to decline.

The man says:

""No cigarettes, no whiskey… not even a proper curse unless Walter’s yelling in your ear.
Even when you want to make a decision, you only think for five minutes!
You’re amazing, Carl.""

Carl looks at him, shocked.

Carl: “You… how do you know all that? Tell me the truth!”
Narrator: “Truth is bitter. That’s why most people take their coffee with sugar… and their lives with lies.”

""You know Carl, you and I…
we’re similar.
But maybe…
maybe it’s just fate that has a problem with us.""

Carl: “You… who are you?”

Narrator: “Who am I? That’s funny — no one’s ever asked.”
Carl (angrily): “Answer me!”
Narrator: “Easy, boy, easy.
You know… I forgot who I used to be.
But now — they call me The Narrator.
My friends call me that.
I tell stories.
Your story… is different.”

Carl: “You… have friends?”
Narrator: “Yeah.
A few concepts.
And the graves of people whose stories I’ve already told.”

Carl lowers his head, afraid.
The Narrator speaks again:

""You know Carl, a coin has two sides —
one is victory, the other is defeat.
Victory means life.
Defeat means death.""

He tosses a coin in the air — but suddenly, it vanishes.

""You see, Carl…
I don’t even bother to check how the coin lands.
But you —
you really intrigue me.
Heads or tails?""

Carl: “The coin doesn’t decide for me.”

Narrator: “Alright… we’ll see.”

He tosses a coin — and it lands upright.
Not heads. Not tails. Just… standing.

Narrator: “Where I come from, this doesn’t happen.
Strange…
You know, Carl, even Fate is doubting you now —
even it has lost faith in you.
And I…
I love people who’ve lost their faith.”
“You used to have this spark in your eyes, but now…”

The Narrator points to Carl’s blood-soaked clothes.

“…Now we’re here.”

He pulls out Amy’s white scarf — now stained with blood.

Narrator: “Just five seconds.
That’s all it took, Carl.
Five seconds of distraction.”

Carl: “You… you…”

The Narrator laughs.

Narrator: “Don’t know what to say?
Yeah, sorry — no dialogue was written for you here.”

Carl: “I don’t care about dialogue.
I just want the truth.”

The Narrator pauses — surprised.

Narrator: “Wait… what did you just say?
You?
You never had anything to say.
You always surprise me.
But let me ask you something —
If you find the truth, what will you even do with it?
People chase it all their lives…
and when they finally find it,
they just stare at it.”

Carl stays silent.

Narrator: “You know Carl…
just five seconds.
You’ve always had a problem with time.”

The Narrator stands up.
A train whistle sounds in the distance.
The train arrives.
And as smoke fills the air, the Narrator vanishes into it —
but his voice remains:

“Whatever you choose, Carl…
I’ll be waiting.”

The train leaves.
And on the bench —
there’s a red lighter,
a cigarette pack labeled “5 Seconds,”
and a note:

“You know, Carl —
numbers are fate.
But no one looks at them that way.
Light a cigarette.
It’s not a sin.
At least not for people like us —
people who need to forget pain,
for just… an hour.”

Carl looks at it and says:

“Damn him.
He knew it all along.”

He lights a cigarette.

And yes — you guessed it right.

1kig0vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfeducation/comments/1kig0vp/how_to_become_a_learning_machine_24_learning_tips/,How to Become A Learning Machine: 24 Learning Tips To Make You A Better Learner,"1. Maslow before bloom ​

Cognitive scientists have a saying:​

“Maslow before Bloom”​

It’s the idea that if we want to engage in ‘higher-order thinking’ (Bloom’s Taxonomy), we need to fulfill basic human needs like sleep, food, rest, etc.… (Maslow’s Hierarchy).

And it makes sense.

Imagine trying to learn graduate-level physics with no sleep, intoxicated and as hungry as a bear after hibernation.

It would be a nightmare.

Fulfilling these needs should hold priority over any extra time you would’ve gained from studying or learning. Learning is only secondary.  
​  
​

2. Don’t learn if you won’t implement​

An easy way to forget what you learn is to never use it.

Research shows that retrieval (withdrawing information from long-term memory into conscious awareness) can improve memory by up to 50%- if done within a 24-hour time frame.

The issue we face when letting time pass is that our memory quickly drops after learning something new — this effect is modeled by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve.

So, even if it’s a quick retrieval session (a few minutes), it’s worth doing.  
​

3. Active Learning > Passive Learning​

Learning techniques require active engagement.

Zoning out while reading textbooks or watching lectures won’t cut it.

1 hour spent:

* Constructing knowledge
* Creating inferences
* Applying knowledge

Will always outweigh 4 hours spent passively reading textbooks or listening to lectures.

It’s a habit you’ll acquire over time, so long as you practice self-awareness and push yourself to engage.

But without it, you can’t learn effectively.



4. Good learning requires cognitive discomfort​

Quality learning comes from quality thinking.

And if you’re not using your brain’s mental resources, you’re not learning.

This principle underlies most learning techniques.

But, it’s also a useful litmus test you can use to see whether you’re engaging in the right type of thinking.



5. How to stop banging your head against the wall​

We often waste hours struggling to understand a concept or solve a problem, hoping things click.

When the real issue (more often than not) is that we’ve processed the text from the wrong perspective.

Solution?

Take a break. Work on something else, and give your mind time to enter a diffused state so that it has a fresh set of eyes.

This will allow you to interpret what you’ve read differently the next time around, increasing the chances that it makes sense.  
​

6. Practice beyond mastery is (usually) a waste of time​

You’ve (likely) spent hours practicing the same exercises (static repetition), over and over again, with little to no gain.

This (usually) stems from the belief that more practice leads to more learning.

However, this argument leaves out two key details:​

* Little to no learning occurs once you reach unconscious incompetence with minimal errors.​
* Opportunity cost exists. So, based on your learning stage would other techniques have led to better outcomes?​

When we consider this, we find that static repetition (in general) is a waste of time.

So what’s the alternative?

Variable practice.

This type of practice uses drills, problems, and exercises across different contexts and with different variables.

This approach to practice increases your surface area of learning (ensuring your time is well spent).



7. Research experts.​

At the start of a learning project, we have no new knowledge to build on.

This makes it one of the hardest learning stages.

But we can short-cut the time it takes to build a base level of knowledge by spending time learning how experts think about a subject.

By researching:​

* Mental Models
* General Principles
* Important Categories​

etc…

We create a foundation for new knowledge to build on, and we save ourselves the time it would’ve taken to build it from scratch.



8. Always Plan​

Expert learners are self-regulated learners.

And it’s because good planning precedes good learning.

And if you don’t plan, you end up with unfocused effort and half-learned concepts.

How much time you plan should depend on the nature and quantity of content. I aim to spend 5% of my learning time planning and reflecting on learning outcomes.

Doing this will keep your sessions more focused, which will lead to more learning.  
​

9. Avoid distractions​

1 hour of deep study > 4 hours of distracted learning.

Nail this mantra into your head every day.

It’s one of the reasons we struggle to learn anything meaningful.

Our brain processes a limited amount of information, and wasting its resources by focusing on brain-rotting internet videos is doing you a disservice.  
​

10. You’re not born an expert learner.​

Most social environments (home, school, friends) make us believe that intelligence is the only predictor of learning outcomes.

But that’s false.

Learning skills (among other variables) tend to matter more.

And learning skills (like anything) are learnable, which means that even if you find it hard to learn new things, you can get better.

This is an essential perspective to have as you work your way to become a better learner.  
​

11. Knowledge Obsessed.​

In an interview with Yorkshire Television, Richard Feynman (a well-known physicist) made an interesting point that I remember to this day.

In his words:

“If you give me the right man, in any field, I can talk to him. But I know what the condition is, that he did whatever he did, to go as far as he could go!”

I still get goosebumps hearing it.

His observation was that certain kinds of men/women (in any field) are always looking to stretch their minds as far as they can go.

They’re never satisfied with what they know, and they’re always looking to learn more.

It’s a core tenant of being great at whatever skill you choose to learn.  
​

Here’s the link: [Richard Feynman — The World from another point of view](https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/dpheh0hzhm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1HTmhsTlNMUUFGRQ==)



12. Big picture overview → Fine-tuned details​

Imagine you’re given the task of building a house.

Most of us would build a base, carve out some details, then add some final touches and furniture.

That would be the most logical plan.

But we tend to overlook the same logic when learning.

​  
Instead of:​

Base Knowledge → Ideas → Details​

We do:​

Details → Ideas → Base Knowledge​

When we insist on understanding every detail (instead of skimming around and then diving deeper) we start at the wrong learning layer and waste time as a result.

This one behavior (if changed) will easily become the highest-leverage learning activity in your tool belt (saving you mountains of time).



13. The anecdote to most learning problems​

Most learning problems can be solved by better understanding the topic.

This means:​

* More connections
* Improved knowledge structures
* More prior knowledge integration​

From memory issues to trouble applying or thinking critically, I’ve (almost) always solved these problems by improving my understanding.

It’s a good reference point to have when you feel stuck- it’s often the answer.



14. Space your studies​

This ranks among the best learning techniques in most studies (specifically for long-term retention).

And the best part?

It’s not about engaging your brain in a certain way, but about organizing your studies differently than you do now.

Instead of learning a lot in a short period, you spread out your learning sessions on a topic.

I’d recommend doing a 1-day/1-week/1-month split for everything you learn.

(This means retrieving it in those intervals)



15. Feedback is overpowered​

Action produces information.

And this information (feedback) can reveal hidden gaps in our knowledge.

These small (or large) corrections found in how we understand and apply what we’ve learned are crucial for getting the details in our knowledge right.

They’re a natural part of learning since we might process information incorrectly or miss important features.

The more feedback loops you cycle through, the better you’ll get.



16. Refine your perspective​

A theme you find among experts is the # of books they read on a given topic.

More books = More knowledge.

And reading books about a topic from different perspectives allows you to expand on what you know.

In cognitive psychology, this technique is known as variable encoding.

It’s one of the best ways to build a large interconnected web of knowledge once you’ve already reached an intermediate level of understanding.  
​

17. Long-Term Learning.​

We’ve been taught to learn for challenges that are just around the corner.

The next test, the next presentation, the next project, etc.

But doing so can make us blind to what matters most- long-term learning.

Instead, we want to learn with the end in mind.

And we do this through knowledge maintenance.

Ask yourself:

* How will I use this information in the long term?
* What exercises can I do to test myself?
* How often should I revisit this, factoring in its importance? ​

If you reflect on these questions, you’ll be able to create a plan that allows for a lasting understanding.



18. Learning > Performance​

Successful students and self-learners alike focus on learning > performing.

And the irony is that doing so leads to better learning outcomes- all while keeping the motivation to learn high.

If I had to narrow down which mindset shift sparked my motivation to learn, it would be this.

If you focus on learning you never lose, you learn.  
​

19. Generate inferences​

An inference is created when we combine what we know with information from the text to infer something new.​

(Prior knowledge) + (Text) → Inference​

For instance:​

* (Bears can attack humans) + (Johnny was lost in the woods 2 days ago, and a bear is on the loose) → Johnny was (probably) attacked by a bear​
* (Gravity Exists) + (I threw an apple from a building) → The apple will hit the ground​
* (Sugar is sweet) + (We’ve added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the coffee) → The coffee should taste sweeter.​​

All of these are generated by thinking about conclusions that stem from the text and what we know.​

(Hence the word ‘inference’)​

The quality & quantity of your inferences will determine how well you understand the material.

That’s why it’s an essential part of learning anything (especially theory-based subjects).​

More inferences. More learning.



20. Practice. Practice. Practice​

Practice should be the cornerstone of any learning project.

Percentage wise I usually try to have a 5:1 ratio on how much I practice.

But again, this depends on the task.

The simpler it is (tying your shoe) the less practice it’s going to require.



21. Study examples​

Content isn’t enough, we also need to solve problems.

And that’s where examples come in.

We can reverse engineer worked examples to see the method used without having to figure it out ourselves.

Doing so creates mental frameworks that we can apply across contexts to solve other problems down the road.​

Tip: I’ve found it useful to combine worked examples with a practice session afterward



22. Interleave your studies​

Similar to spaced retrieval, **interleaving** is one of the most studied learning techniques.

It restructures how we solve problems so that we can make more connections and replicate the context in which we’ll be using the information more accurately.​

(It’s especially effective for S.T.E.M fields)​

Instead of solving one type of problem for an entire practice session (blocked practice), you mix them up (mixed practice).​​

AAABBBCCC → ABCBACCBA

​  
It’s the best way to structure your practice sessions (according to science).



23. Evaluative thinking​

Evaluative thinking is one of the core tenets of higher-order thinking (check Bloom’s Taxonomy)

This means that evaluating pieces of information through comparison helps engage the right kind of thinking and will create more connections in your brain as a result.

I suggest using this approach when trying to understand similarities or differences between concepts.

Doing so will create fine-tuned connections that will help you apply what you’ve learned and gain a deep understanding of the material.​



24. Have fun​

This is the most important lesson.

If you don’t have fun while you’re learning, what’s the point?

Our brains are wired to generate dopamine when we’re on the verge of new knowledge, and it would be a shame if we treat learning as just a means to an end.​

Learn for fun- that’s what matters.​

That’s it for this post.

40-50g bloom for 45s
Continuous pour up to the required amount of water.

Initially I was adding a splash of whole milk because I’ve always used to milk in coffee, but after enjoying a long black French press coffee at my friend’s house, I decided to add water instead. I’ve finally fallen in love with black coffee! More so than with milk.

Part of me wants to say if I’ve found a method I love, stick with it. But also the caffeinated part of my brain wants to know if it can get better. 

I do find that the brew that comes straight out with this method is too intense for me. The watered down one is sweet and open and aromatic. Part of me wonders if I can adjust the brew to achieve something similar without so much watering down? Another part of me wonders if this is just me adjusting to the intensity of black coffee?

My dad's Tesla turns smoothly off the motorway and our surroundings soon become more and more rural, as we drive past field after field. Trees and hedges become a pleasant green blur outside my window on the faster roads; they are so narrow in comparison to the roads I was used to.

Another turn reveals an expanse of rolling green hills and acres of trees under the sunny September sky. This was definitely the most green I'd seen in years and I was very excited by it.

...

Before I go any further, I should probably introduce myself.

My name is Eliana Reva, but I much prefer to be called Ella because that sounds less like a character from a Lord of the Rings book. As Ella I tend to fit in more and as a classic textbook definition of an introvert that's all I've ever really wanted when I've been at school.

For years I have attended boarding school in London where I currently reside with my parents. My parents work in the city but often have to travel all around the world to various cities, for an international law firm as human rights lawyers.

When I was much younger, we used to live in a small village in the county of Hampshire along the south coast of England, before my parents relocated us to London because of their jobs. London had been an incredible place to live and I was very fond of it. I was never bored in London as there was always an abundance of things to do, but as I got older, it felt more and more like something was missing. I felt a little off balance, like...I wasn't where I was supposed to be. During the last year I had grown very tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, the noise, the endless pavements and the daily chaos of the London underground.

I wanted to be somewhere more rural.

Scratch that, I needed to be somewhere more rural; I felt like I was being called back to where I was born.

I began to feel suffocated in the city and I made the decision to return to my home county in the countryside. I just kept dreaming of green fields, lush grass, huge willow trees and all sorts of wildlife and colourful exotic flowers. It was time to say goodbye to London, during term time, at least.

My parents were more than happy for me to do my sixth form years at another boarding school since they were out of the country so often. They just wanted me to be happy.

I had looked at numerous boarding schools, but a school called Exton College kept snagging my attention. I kept coming back to it's website; featuring an assortment of various beautiful people on it's front page just like the other schools did. But the people on the front page of theirs looked so alive, so happy and I wanted to be one of those happy people.

Their marketing sure got me good.

It had an excellent reputation for science among others and that was incredibly attractive to me as my goal was to apply to study medicine and become a doctor. I valued life and I wanted to make a difference to others with mine. I worked hard and had great grades, even though this was very counterproductive to my vague attempts at a social life. I had maybe one actual friend at my old school and we hadn't even kept in touch during the summer.

All in all, I was quite happy to start fresh somewhere else. A clean slate; not that clean was anything I needed. I had led a fairly boring life at my last school.

But...

...this isn't a boring story, not by a long shot. If anything the next two weeks, the next six months even...well...there was no way I could've predicted anything that lay ahead for me as I innocently sat in the car on our way to my new school.

...

""Two minutes away sweetheart,"" Dad says quietly, checking the sat nav on the dashboard.

I take a deep breath in and sit up a little more in my seat, a nervous anticipation was definitely setting in as my dad turns the car through an imposing set of wrought iron gates that leads down a long road lined with lush poplar trees.

Even the driveway here looked posh. I vaguely remembered the photos of the school from their website and brochure but it looked more impressive in person. The school looked pretty well maintained, to say the least.

We pass a large navy coloured sign which reads 'Welcome to Exton College'; its ivy and wolf's head emblem shining in gold.

'Headmaster: Orion Landry' it says in a smaller font underneath. I remember the brief about the school that the headmaster had written for the school's website and I recall the photo of him. He had given me serious Dumbledore vibes, but I couldn't decide if it was the foot long white beard he had or his kind green eyes full of wisdom that leapt out from the photo. I had never before seen eyes that green. He definitely looked too old to be running a school, but I couldn't argue that he looked exactly like what I'd expect from the Headmaster of a very distinguished school.

Presently, dad pulls the car into an unmarked parking spot in a large gravelled car park.

""Well...this is it,"" he says, letting out a long whistle as he cranes his neck to look through the windscreen, up at the vast building in front of us.

""This looks very different to my last school, that's for sure,"" I comment quietly. My last school could only have been described as a grey, concrete box, the only source of life being a solitary yew tree in the main courtyard.

I get out of the car, more than keen to stretch my legs after the long journey. I hold my hand up to shield my eyes as I take in the imposing sight before me.

A grand, red and beige bricked building stands before us. It has four main turrets around the front section and the tall windows make it look very distinguished. There are a large set of thick oak doors which sit proudly in the middle of the main building, flanked by pure white marble pillars. Ivy has snaked its way up the walls all around the building and around the large arched windows in particular which added to the grand mystique of the place. Back in London my schools were in a variety of different buildings, but nothing living snaked its way up the walls...or anywhere nearby for that matter.

Dad opens the trunk of the car and pulls out my suitcases while I fumble around in my satchel for the bundle of paperwork I had been sent a few weeks ago.

An SUV and another Tesla arrive in the car park to drop other students off just as we ascend the steps and enter the school through the large oak doors, finding ourselves in a grand atrium.

I gasp.

It is huge and the decor is rather decadent. It reminds me of the typical entrances they have in the posh hotels back in London.

I immediately can't help but notice the grand staircase at the back. A beautiful and thick, rich, navy coloured carpet snakes all the way up the stairs to the first floor. The flooring of the atrium is a highly polished light hard wood that leads to baroque style walls. The biggest feature was a huge, gilded painting of a bizarrely pure golden wolf which adorned the wall at the back of the staircase. The painting was at least ten by twelve feet wide. The wolf had familiar piercing green eyes and was stood proudly on a hill top overlooking a forest and a vast meadow. It was beautiful, and I wondered where wolves fit into the history of the school considering they were also part of the school's logo. Above the bottom of the staircase was a beautiful and rather sizable chandelier with hundreds of glittering lights. The ceiling itself was ornate too.

I immediately feel rather overwhelmed by the beauty and grandeur of this place and I inhale sharply as I take it all in.

This looked nothing like how I imagined a school to look, it was very impressive...but I wasn't. Was I going to fit in here?

My reverie was broken by a woman calling out from the side of the atrium.

""Hello there! Good afternoon! You must be new to the college?"" a woman calls to us from behind a large reception desk to our left. I turned to face the woman, who has dark hair framing her plump and homely face. I step forward apprehensively toward the desk.

""Hi. Yes...I...I'm new,"" I smile nervously. She smiles back at me warmly which relaxes me a little, and she gestures for me to come over.

""Well, head on over here honey and lets go through the paperwork. Then we will get your room key and welcome pack sorted,"" she says, putting her glasses on from around her neck.

""I'll do it,"" Dad offers happily, taking the paperwork from me and heading over to the receptionist himself while I walk further into the atrium. To the right of the stair case was a large set of comfortable looking navy blue sofas arranged around a circular oak coffee table.

Along the wall behind the sofa arrangement is a wide notice board split into 'secondary' and 'sixth form' sections, along with a few vending machines located a little further away near one of several corridors off the atrium.

This was definitely not a small school.

Exton College was a sixth form, therefore students could attend the secondary school as normal from the age of eleven up until they reached sixteen. They could then continue their college level studies up until the age of eighteen. Or, there could be people like me, joining for the final two years of sixth form after leaving a normal secondary school.

I walk over and take a closer look at what was on the sixth form notice board. There was a basic list of events listed for the coming academic year.

Winter Formal - November 19th

...

Sixth form ski trip to Chamonix - February 18th

...

Spring Formal - April 4th

I make a mental note to sign up for the ski trip. It was one of the most exhilarating things to do and I simply loved it. I'd gone almost every winter with my parents for as long as I could remember...but we unfortunately weren't going this year as my parents were going to be in California for several months.

""Come on then Els, let's go find your new room,"" Dad says eagerly from behind me, having now finished exchanging forms and receiving various items from the lady on reception. I grab the handle of one of my suitcases and head to the lift to the side of reception rather than take the staircase.

After following some signs for the 'ladies residential wing' we find room 2.06; my room for the next two years.

""...and here...we...go..."", mutters Dad, slotting my new keycard into the security slot by the door. We open the door and step across the threshold. I am quite surprised at how large the room is. I am also surprised to see only two beds, having been in a dormitory with five other girls for the last few years.

Two double beds flank either side of the room along the back wall, with an ensuite to the right and a sizable study area to the left. At the foot of both beds are large oak trunks and along the wall are oak wardrobes. Each wardrobe features a full length mirror in one of the doors. The decor of this room was in stark contrast to the grandeur of the atrium. Plain white walls, oak furniture and a dark grey carpet; more modern and simple compared to the grandiose appearance of the atrium.

The main source of colour in the room comes from a dark pink floral duvet topped with a fluffy cream bedspread that is already on one of the beds. I definitely had a roommate, but she wasn't here right now. I notice a few photos stuck around the mirror on the associated wardrobe, mainly featuring a rather stunning girl with long, wavy, dark brown hair and another pair of startlingly green eyes. She was surrounded by the same people in every photo and I feel a little overwhelmed again, wondering what my roommate was going to be like. She clearly had an established life here at this school. Would she even like me? The girls in my dormitory didn't care much about me and I'd lived with them for five years.

I notice the lack of any other personal effects and this tells me she probably hasn't returned just yet. Maybe she could show me around, at least?

Dad checks his watch and sighs a little.

""I'm so sorry honey, but I really can't stay too much longer, your mum and I have that flight to catch. Now....are you definitely sure that this is what you want? No travelling tutor? You could still come along with us?"" he says, holding both my upper arms and looking at me quite seriously in the face.

I'm not sure. But I just need to be here.

I smile at him, for I am used to this verbal exchange as we had done it every September for the past ten years. But something about this place is giving me a great feeling of trepidation among other things that I had certainly not felt at any of my other schools. For once it just felt like I had come to the right place and this was exactly where I needed to be.

I nod sincerely.

""Honestly Dad, I am really excited. This was a good decision for me. Besides, I'll see you both at Christmas, then again at Easter, and we will all be so busy anyway that time is going to go so quickly,"" I reassure him. He smiles warmly in response and pulls me into a big hug before giving me a kiss on my forehead. Then, with his hands on my shoulders once more, he studies my face.

""Well...don't forget we are always just a phone call away...or maybe an email when you factor in the time difference. Only call it you really have to,"" he jokes. I laugh and nod.

""Have a safe journey home, dad. Also a safe flight, of course. Honestly, please don't worry about me, I am going to be just fine.""

He hugs me tightly once again before exiting the room. The door clicks shut and that's it; I am on my own.

I sit on the edge of my new bed for a moment and breathe through the nerves I'd hidden from my dad. It was hard starting somewhere new, but I knew I just had to embrace it and power through it, because that was what I did.

I go over to the large window at the back of the room in between the two beds and I look out across the grounds. They are vast, green and lush, just like I had wanted. I can see several other buildings separate from this one; this campus really was quite large.

The closest I had to this back home was Regents Park. I carefully open the window and take a deep breath in, enjoying the invigorating feeling of the warm, late summer air entering my lungs. Looking out at the beaming sunshine I soon feel wide awake, my nerves disappearing as excitement starts to set in again.

It was only half past four so there was still some time before dinner. I look at the site map I'd been given which had the meal times and other items of information anyone new to the school would need to know. The school was actually huge. I wonder how long it will take me to find my way around.

I go back over to my side of the room and begin unpacking my things, wondering when my roommate was going to arrive. Mostly, I wondered exactly what she was going to be like...

# My Roommate

\*\*\*Freya\*\*\*

My brother performs yet another sharp turn as he drives his car through the gates of the school grounds, speeding hastily down the poplar lined driveway toward the car park.

""This has definitely beat Stephen dropping us off, surely?"" my brother Austin says as he deftly swings the car perfectly into a parking spot in the student car park. I exhale with relief as the car stops with a sudden jolt.

We had made it.

""Yeah. I just love feeling car sick while you see local speed limits as a general guideline,"" I say with a hefty amount of sarcasm. I am just thankful we have made it back to school alive. Austin laughs heartily at my reaction. Typical.

He'd passed his test six months ago but he still hadn't quite moved out of the standard teenage 'rally driver' phase. He drove fast and I was very thankful he had near perfect reflexes or else we'd have ended up in a hedge somewhere well before we'd gotten anywhere near Exton.

I look over at him with an exaggerated scowl as he turns towards me and I tut loudly. He had the same thick, dark wavy hair just like me and we had the same piercing green eyes everyone in our family have always had. We also have the same generous dark eyebrows, except mine were kept very well groomed whereas his were perhaps a little on the wild side. He had grown a few inches over the summer and was now a gangly six foot two inches, while I was a rather respectable five foot nine, which was considered tall for a woman, particularly someone my age. I had only turned sixteen in June; I was annoyingly one of the babies of the year and I really hated that. We looked the same age, but there was only seventeen months between us and this was probably why we got on so well.

The adrenaline rush from his hazardous driving aside, I adored my brother and generally so did everyone else who met him. He was easily the most liked person in school, a fact he had always seemed entirely oblivious to which only made people like him more.

""Ouch, Freya,"" he says with mock sadness, ""I will remember this when Stephen starts teaching you in the summer and you start to enjoy the freedom that driving brings,"" he says, flashing me his classic cheeky smile. I smile back at him and he chuckles! he's got away with it once again.

We both get out of the car and he starts taking my various belongings out of the car boot. He just has a single backpack. I wasn't sure how he was going to survive the school year on one backpack of clothes when he'd grown half a foot over the summer. Austin was useless when it came to having clothes that fitted. He also had a penchant for destroying clothes almost every time he shifted, so that backpack of clothes wasn't going to last long at all. Perhaps a fortnight.

If you're new around here, you may be wondering what I mean when I say 'shifted'. Austin and I weren't typical teenagers, or at least, we were not like the majority of the human teenagers in the country. There was still definitely plenty of us. Well over two hundred thousand across the country alone...but the human population was entirely oblivious to us and for thousands of years it had been kept that way.

We looked human, but we weren't. Not technically...and definitely not at night under a full moon.

We were Lycan.

We'd been called many things over the years, particularly 'werewolves', which was a mythological creature in pop culture. Definitely moreso thanks to the Underworld film franchise, Teen Wolf, Twilight and The Vampire Diaries. We weren't exactly like how they portrayed us. We hadn't been cursed or bitten, it was in our blood and written into our genetic makeup. We lived in packs across the entire world, much like normal wolves did. Lycans were however, much bigger than normal wolves and the key difference of course was that we were both human and wolf in one person. From the first full moon at the full onset of puberty we could shift into our wolf's form, taking on the appearance of the wolf spirit we became blended with, gifted to us by our Moon Goddess. We were blended with them for life. A best friend, an advisor, a partner in crime who would walk with us until our dying day, and then maybe...maybe we'd become a spirit ourselves one day and basically live on within someone else.

Here we are, back at our home away from home, I said inwardly to my wolf spirit Mira.

Hopefully your grandfather has sorted out the roommate issue from last year. Although a room to ourselves might not be so bad...I mean really, it's time for you to start mingling with the boys, Mira muses.

I shuddered at the thought of my roommate from last year.

Can't be any worse than an insane witch, right? I joke.

Maybe we will be blessed with a nice simple human or something...if we have to have one at all, Mira suggests.

I stare up at the grand building I knew and loved so much. I had been coming here as a student since I was eleven, but I had come here many times ever since I was very young; because this school was our family's legacy.

It wasn't a normal school like hundreds of others across the country. It was a school mainly for the supernatural, governed for hundreds of years by our family. Our family also led our pack, which was the oldest and amongst the largest packs in the United Kingdom. Our father Leo Landry was the alpha in charge of our pack.

I pick my things up, effortlessly. Wolf strength came in handy for moments like this, but most especially when it came to a heavy day of clothes shopping, something I'd not done in so long; which by my standards was roughly only two weeks...

I walk through the big oak doors and flash a warm smile to Lynda, who manned Exton's reception desk.

""Welcome back you two,"" she says, before turning a little to rummage in a tray of paperwork.

""My my, haven't you both grown over the summer,"" she then says toward the both of us, ""you are becoming so handsome, Austin! You must be beating all the girls away with a tree trunk!""

She slides our timetables and room key cards across the reception desk toward us as I roll my eyes a little.

Austin had grown considerably over the summer and his baby fat days were definitely now far behind him. As such, there had been a lot more comments about his good looks, particularly from the other girls in the pack over the summer. I didn't mind it too much from Lynda, though, as she was something like a surrogate aunt to us while we were here at the school, and her comments were more maternal than anything else.

""Very kind of you to point that out Lynda. I hope you had a great summer,"" I say a little sarcastically, grabbing both items.

""I am loving the new hair cut on you Lynda, it really suits you,"" Austin says with a broad smile before following me towards the stairs. Oh for heaven's sake...

Turning the charm on as always. Get used to it, though, it's just going to get worse when he hits eighteen in a few months, Mira growls in amusement.

She knew how annoying I had found the fawning comments about him over the summer. Admittedly it was probably because no one ever made about me, but that was the life living in the shadow of our next pack alpha.

We both throw our usual respectful nod toward the golden wolf on the giant painting on the back wall. The painting was many hundreds of years old and supposedly featured our pack's founder.

The Landry bloodline was indeed very old, and very well respected. Our pack, the Golden Lycans, was the third largest in the country, and our name uniquely comes from a legend, rather than the area from which we originate. We descended from one of the original Lycans within this country and legend said he had fur of pure gold...soft to touch, and yet entirely impenetrable like armour. Supposedly, he had been impervious to fire and had been impossible to kill; but it was just a fancy story to explain our strange name, in my mind. Lycans only came in greyscale and browns.",1,1746789551.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1kifyy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kifyy8/this_really_is_an_addiction_i_should_know/,This REALLY is an addiction. I should know...,"So yeah short post. I've been addicted to heavier stuff than coffee. 2 years clean now. I know how it feels. Recently realized that my coffee intake has spiked enormously, it's my addictive personality. So I decided to severely limit my coffee intake.

Today I drank a coffee in the morning, and another just before lunch. ""Normally"" I'd be on double-espresso #5 or something already.

I was standing on the balcony and noticed I felt off. Not ""bad"", just the feeling of ""whatever. I don't care. Hopeless. Nothing exciting to look forward to."" etc. So I had an espresso and (now) 30 mins later I feel excited to work, learn, talk to colleagues, etc.

It's just an addiction. It's an insidious one, because it's normal, nay, expected you drink coffee, especially in work environments. 

But let me tell you, the substance doesn't matter. I was addicted to opiates, and the ""meh...."" to ""yay"" feeling is EXACTLY the same. Doesn't matter that this is a stimulant instead of an opiate. It's the same. Only difference is that the ""meh..."" doesn't become ""oh fuck I wanna die and get rid of this excruciating panic and anxiety and sickness I'm feeling"", it just becomes more ""meh"" with a headache. But the interaction **when indulging again** feels exactly the same for me.

The whole ""it's just coffee"" is so wrong. It's a drug, and we get used to it, and then require it to feel OK. Just an ordinary drug. It's just like people giving alcohol its own category, just stupid imo. Drugs are drugs. This one is just benificial to capitalism :P",7,1746789446.0,decaf,1,1.0,False
1kifyxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kifyxy/can_the_shardor_kc101_coffee_maker_review_help/,Can the SHARDOR KC101 Coffee Maker Review Help You Brew Perfect Cups?,"The SHARDOR KC101 Coffee Maker has been my trusty companion over the past month. As someone who swings between the need for a piping hot cup of joe in the morning and a chilled iced brew during lazy afternoons, this machine seemed like it was designed for me. It combines a sleek aesthetic with versatility in a way that's both practical and stylish, offering features that cater to different preferences. However, as with any product, it has its share of quirks that are worth considering before making a purchase.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Aesthetically pleasing, this matte black coffee machine feels like a premium addition to my kitchen counter. It's compact at 10""D x 6.3""W x 11""H, which makes a world of difference in a smaller kitchen like mine. The stainless steel finish is not only durable but also easy to clean. Its 50 oz removable water tank is a game-changer for someone like me who hates refilling tanks constantly. I was genuinely impressed by the visible tank design, which made spotting impurities or build-up a hassle-free task. However, while the overall build is solid, the plastic components, namely the reusable grinding filter holder, do feel slightly less sturdy than their stainless-steel counterparts.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
The flexibility this coffee machine offers is fantastic. It caters to both K-Cup pods and ground coffee, allowing me to experiment with brands and blends. The bold brew setting lets me crank up the strength for those days where regular coffee just won’t cut it. Brewing time was surprisingly quick, and I loved how I could start my coffee within seconds. Whether I brewed a single 6 oz cup for myself or went all out with the 14 oz option, the end result consistently tasted fresh. On the flip side, the machine can get a little noisy during operation, which might not be ideal during the quiet crack of dawn.

**Upsides**  
- Adaptable for K-Cups and ground coffee, perfect for variety lovers.  
- Bold brew option caters to strong coffee enthusiasts.  
- Compact size fits snugly in limited spaces.  
- Quick heating mechanism ensures coffee on demand.  
- 50 oz water tank minimizes frequent refills.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Brewing process can be a bit noisy.  
- Some plastic components feel less durable compared to the stainless steel build.  

**Ease of Use and Settings**  
I'm not someone who enjoys fiddling with overly complicated machines, so the button-operated system on this coffee maker was very welcome. The control panel was intuitive, and adjusting brew sizes between the five options was seamless. Plus, it fits taller travel mugs up to 6.3 inches—a major win for convenience when rushing out the door. One small hiccup, however, was that the power cable felt slightly short, which limited placement options on my counter unless directly near an outlet.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning has never been my favorite activity, but the detachable capsule holder and reusable filter make maintaining this coffee machine a breeze. I appreciated how the water reservoir could be fully removed—this made it much easier to clean than fixed tanks. The removable drip tray accounts for any accidental mess while also accommodating larger mugs. However, the machine could benefit from clearer descaling instructions, as I found the manual a bit lacking in detailed maintenance guidelines.

**Product Competitors**  
In the realm of compact coffee machines, there’s no shortage of contenders. The Keurig K-Elite is a strong alternative known for its robust customizability and iced coffee settings. Both devices cater to K-Cup users, but the SHARDOR KC101 stands out with its compatibility with ground coffee right out of the box. On the other hand, the Nespresso Vertuo is another noteworthy rival, excelling in crema quality and pod system exclusivity. While the SHARDOR doesn’t deliver the same luxurious foam topping, it more than compensates with impressive brewing flexibility and price efficiency. Critics might argue the Keurig edges out in brewing consistency for pods, though the SHARDOR’s bold brew feature gives it an appealing edge for lovers of rich coffee.

**True Value**  
Trying to assess its “bang for the buck,” I’d say this device scores high. While it doesn't come with a premium price tag, it packs premium features like adjustable brew sizes, bold flavors, and compatibility for ground coffee and K-Cups. I appreciate products that effectively blend affordability with utility, and this coffee maker feels like a worthwhile addition to my morning routine. Sure, it's not perfect, but for its price category, it's tough to beat.

I'm now a month in and I feel brain fog, strange dips in energy.
Everything feels a bit harder.

I'm curious: 

• If you successfully quit caffeine, how long did it take for your energy and focus to come back?

• Did you replace it with anything (adaptogens, supplements, lifestyle changes)?

• Did anyone here ever use caffeine pills? Do they also give you symptoms?

• What helped you most to function normally during that ""dead zone"" phase?

I'd love to hear any personal tips or what worked for you - especially from people who used caffeine for years and managed to break the cycle without losing their minds.

Thanks in advance!",1,1746789316.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

$KENDU is community, and could be your future

Kendu Inu is luxury through rebellion. It’s a brand without permission, open to anyone with vision. You don’t ask to use it. You build with it. You wear it. You make it yours. Entrepreneurs aren’t just launching businesses—they’re creating movements under the Kendu name. And the brilliance? They don’t do it alone. Every holder of the Kendu token becomes a stakeholder in the culture. They promote the product, push the vision, and drive the value forward because when the brand wins, they win.

There’s no boardroom here. No gatekeepers. Just raw, decentralized energy. A brand that grows through the hands of the many. Anyone can make a product. A card, a marketplace, a fashion line. Kendu is the canvas and the community is the gallery. The token doesn’t just sit in a wallet. It lives in every tweet, every product launch, every conversation. It’s a signal. And the more it’s used, the stronger it becomes.

This isn’t just crypto. It’s cultural currency. A symbol of ownership, rebellion, and design without compromise. The brand doesn’t ask for approval. It commands attention. That’s Kendu. Unapologetic. Expansive. Alive.

Kendu is not a fleeting trend. It is an original intellectual property, standing apart from hype, narrative gimmicks, or passing launches. It is a bold statement of independence and clarity. The community behind Kendu embraces what they call a “can do attitude.” It is this philosophy that fuels consistent, self-driven growth. The motto is clear. We don’t gamble. We work. While the rest of DeFi plays, Kendu builds.

There is no paid marketing. No bots. No artificial volume. Kendu grows through the consistent efforts of its holders. You are not asked to wait. You are invited to act. Post. Speak. Build. Represent. You are part of the brand.

KENDU AUDIT

Kendu became the second memecoin in history to earn a CertiK audit through nothing but raw community support. Fifty thousand real votes. No shortcuts. No tricks. Its score is currently 98/100.

KENDU BUSINESS

Kendu is not just a token. It is a platform for expression and a launchpad for ideas. It is a lifestyle. It gives you the freedom to create what you believe in and bring it to the world under the Kendu umbrella. There is no gatekeeping. Just a global audience ready to support.

Kendu already powers community-built ventures including:
	•	A Kendu board game
	•	Kendu Games Studio featuring former Bioware and AAA developers
	•	Kendu beers and energy drinks
	•	Kendu Entertainment in India
	•	Kendu Street events in the United States

1kifvi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1kifvi9/caffeine/,caffeine,"Hey everyone,
I’ve recently started cutting out caffeine after using it daily for most of my life — mostly in the form of coffee or yerba mate. I’m now a month in and I feel brain fog, strange dips in energy. Everything feels a bit harder.

I’m curious:

	•	If you successfully quit caffeine, how long did it take for your energy and focus to come back?

	•	Did you replace it with anything (adaptogens, supplements, lifestyle changes)?

	•	Did anyone here ever use caffeine pills? Do they also give you symptoms?

	•	What helped you most to function normally during that “dead zone” phase?

I’d love to hear any personal tips or what worked for you — especially from people who used caffeine for years and managed to break the cycle without losing their minds.

Thanks in advance!

The fact is…

Every company, in every country, every city, every town has SALES problems.

The bigger they are, the bigger their profit holes.

The number of peeps who need our help is STAGGERING.

That’s why I’m not afraid when folks say “what if there are too many service providers offering androids–won’t it get saturated?”

It will for the guys who aren’t creative!

But you gotta think outside the box. The world is bigger than Solar companies and roofers.

There are MILLIONS of businesses out there who need YOUR help fixing their sales holes.

That’s why I LOVE Andrew telling me he’s done a deal with a company selling CABINS.

And better yet… he gets a tasty $500 commish per sale.

On a 350,000 list!!

Even a tiny 1% conversion rate would net him 3,500 sales = 1.75m in commish.

That’s a good pay day in my books ;)

Now here’s where it gets real cool.

Andrew can use our Abandoned Cart ecomm android to scoop up all the peeps who didn’t buy.

And then, he can use Ecomm BUYERS Android to upsell the existing buyers even more stuff and make more moolah.

There’s more he can do too with our other androids.

Which will squeeze more juice from this one partner.

Done right, he’s set for life… with ONE partner!

Want the Androids, training, and support to build deals like Andrew’s?

What caught my attention is that they claim to be fully skill-based, with no bots or luck-based payouts and honestly, that claim mostly holds up atleast for me.

[Winzo games screen](https://preview.redd.it/zn550usylqze1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6180dfec3bf71a208215152edab130386e50b9d9)

  
  
Over the past month, I’ve played a bunch of games on WinZO:  
1) Solitaire - Fast 2-minute games, super clean interface  
2) Candy Match - Surprisingly strategic with turbo boosts  
3) Dominoes - Classic head-to-head, feels fair and competitive  
4) Bingo - 90 seconds, real-time number marking chaos  
  
What I liked:  
1) You actually play against other people. The matchups feel fair - I've had wins/losses with 3–5 point differences.  
2) You can cash out via PayPal, and I’ve done so multiple times with no hiccups. No thresholds, no long delays.  
3) No ads at all. That alone makes it better than 90% of the gaming apps out there.  
4) Every game finishes in 2–3 minutes max - great for short breaks during the day.  
  
Things to know before you dive into it:  
1) If you’re bad at the game, you’ll lose - it’s not random spin-to-win stuff. You need to think, especially in Solitaire and Candy Match.  
2) Higher-stake games ($2+) have noticeably better players. I got wrecked in my first one. Stick to 20c or 50c till you're confident.  
3) Not a way to “get rich”, but if you play smart, you can cover your daily coffee and then some.  
  
I’d rate the platform 8.5/10 overall for its simplicity, fairness, and fast payouts.

Bit of a pretext: He has worked hard all his life, refuses to ‘retire’, refuses to travel (for a break) while he never fantasised about settling abroad anyway; he has worked in more than 30+ countries, refuses to have a social life, refuses to immigrate to first world, live life on auto pilot (its easy for him), did not do well love wise, is very hard working, is a sub-contractor to MNC in Lahore. 

Lately i returned to Pakistan, I have noticed crazy decline. He is tired all the time but is still adamant he doesn’t want to fucking stop working. While 65 is old, my grandfather is 85 and is very quick and haste. My dado is still alive and they share a love bond which i feel my father is deprived of. My mother is not alive. Let’s not delve into this. 

I want him to have fun. I suspect his testosterone is low (adding to his tiredness and weakness), because of the coffee he devours 24/7 (without food) Still working in high stress environment, not taking a fucking break. I bought him men’s health supplements (best in the world-FDA approved extract from Tongkat Ali), from SE Asia. (If i eat one of it, i get absolutely and crazy and uncomfortable) 

i have secretly fed him 1 strip of it (6 tablets-6 days) and there is absolutely zero affect on him. Some of my female friends abroad joke about being sugar baby for him but this is too unrealistic and inorganic. 

If i can only get this issue (if there is) fixed and get him to go out, everything will be fixed. Maybe he will meet someone organically and some women can calm him down and fix it with love and ask him to stop working, retire and travel with him?

I am confused and I almost cry out looking at him with his heightened nerves working overtime at 1000% capacity. I have asked him if his ‘fauji is retired’ and he laughs on it. I can’t get him to spill. He is too gullible and doesnt pay heed to women who give him the eye when he goes out. What the fuck am i supposed to do? Will love fix him? 

There is no money, housing, transportation issue what so fucking ever. He is loaded money wise. I fear i read workaholics suicide at the end of their life when their bodies give up and they cant get a kick out of working. I am strong but this is breaking me internally. 

I got him into an auto-pilot business and he got depressed after a while sitting and got into working again. I can’t ask him to stop working as it may cause him depression. I know 1 women hurt him real bad around 15 years ago (5 years after my mother). He cried (the only time i saw him crying) and he changed. Maybe the reason he stop looking for companionship.

I sent him back a text telling him i had given away the tickets as i didn't think we would still go there together, and then added a second line asking if he'd want to grab a coffee and catch up.

The United Planets soldiers rammed into the Nemesis forces with a fierce clash. Bodies flew over the battlefield as the two factions fought to control the divinus. 

Sarah stomped across the Nemesis army, but they retaliated with heavy plasma cannon fire, forcing the giantess back as they hit her shoulder.

As she saw the carnage, Daisy fell into a daze from being in the heat of war. Never before had she seen such concentrated death and violence. However, lost in thought, a Nemesis soldier hurried to decapitate her, but Everton pushed her out of harm's way. As the soldier attempted to slash him instead, Everton caught his blade, punched him, and threw his body at his comrades.

""Daisy, have you lost your senses?” Everton vigorously shook her, trying to break her free of her daze. “Forgotten what I taught you about a warrior's focus?""

""I'm sorry, but here's different from the Colosseum.""

*""You have no idea.""*

""U-understood. I won't hold anyone back.""

Daisy struggled to get to her feet. As she stood, plasma fire blasted her shield from her hand. She dashed for her weapon, seeing Nemesis soldiers incoming. As Everton went to help, a Nemesis soldier tackled him, knocking him away from her. The soldiers shot her hand as Daisy neared her shield. She dropped to the ground in pain. The enemy trained their guns to kill her, but before they could pull their triggers, Sarah crushed them with her giant hand.

""I tried to warn you, human. The shield is the weapon of losers. How are you supposed to injure or kill someone with one of those?""

Daisy giggled at Sarah’s remark but stopped as she spotted cannons aiming at her. ""Look out.""

The cannons hit Sarah in the face as she turned around to see what was coming. She crashed to the ground, barely conscious, shrinking back down. An obstacle came to block her path as Daisy ran to her aid. A Nemesis soldier elbowed her in the face, knocking her down. The soldier further attempted to stab her with his tyloblade, but she kicked him in the face as he pounced on her. 

Daisy quickly grabbed her shield, and as the soldier lunged to stab her again, landed a throat shot with it. The Nemesis soldier fell to the ground, dropping his blade. However, he quickly found a gun lying by the corpse of one of his fallen comrades and unloaded it on Daisy. Still, the young woman took refuge from the shots behind her shield.

Daisy charged at the soldier from behind her shield, ramming into him and pinning him to the ground. He scrambled for his gun, but she twisted his wrist. The weapon dropped. However, he flung her off, and she lost her grip on her shield as she hit the ground. Daisy and the soldier then spotted the gun on the ground. Without any other means of attack or defense, the gun was the key to victory in their duel. They both dived for it, but the soldier grabbed it first. Still, as he aimed it at Daisy, she punched him, making him drop it. 

Hastily, she took the gun, and before the soldier could do anything, she fired it, killing him.

""I-I did it.” Daisy slowly realized the consequences of her actions as the words left her mouth. “My god, I just killed someone.""

Daisy gazed at the soldier as he lay dead, and the reality hit her like a brick. The purest pale white slowly covered her face, and her trembling hand dropped the gun. Daisy forced down vomit as the world around her became a fuzzy mess. She staggered through the battlefield until she bumped into another Nemesis soldier. The soldier readied to kill with his sword. However, as he was about to impale her, Everton beat him with Daisy's shield.

""Everton, I killed someone. What have I done?""

""You went somewhere the kind and loving should never go, a killing field. You poor confused child, please forgive me for not keeping you away from here.""

\*\*\*

Elsewhere, the Nemesis forces forged a tight defensive line, protecting the fortress with the divinus. The combination of their superior numbers and powerful tanks rained terror upon the United Planets. The planets were like a force, though strong-willed and determined, weren’t unstoppable as they met an immovable object. The Nemesis slowly pushed their advance back, shoving their enemies closer and closer to defeat.

Gancelot slashed through hordes of Nemesis soldiers. Giant glowing cards mowed through them telekinetically directed by his hands like spinning saw blades across the battlefield. But he soon scanned around and saw his army crumbling, releasing a sigh and a bitter groan. The United Planets soldiers dropped like flies, and their dead bodies started to clutter the ground.

Gancelot activated his communicator, pressing a button on his wrist. ""United Planets, I am playing our trump card.""

As Gancelot gave his order, intense fear washed across the remaining United Planets soldiers. The soldiers quickly abandoned their advance, retreating as fast as possible away from the vice-commander. The healthy ran like the wind. Others carried their injured comrades at a desperate pace. 

As his forces were far enough away, Gancelot raised his hand, and his cards swiftly flew toward him, circling his body. He struck the ground with them, cutting across the land in a circular motion, carving out a great circle, and a titanic shockwave washed across the battlefield. All the Nemesis soldiers caught in the card's destructive path got swatted away like bugs. As he finished the circle, the colossal shockwave grew bigger and bigger, swallowing the battlefield and sending most of the enemy force flying in a monstrous dust devil.

Daisy and Everton were about to get caught in the strike, but Sarah grasped them with her giant hand. She clutched onto the ground, fighting against the herculean strength of the winds. As she struggled, Daisy’s eyes widened as far as they could go as she looked upwards, seeing legions of mighty Nemesis soldiers in the sky, falling helplessly to certain death.

Gancelot collapsed from his Herculean efforts. *""Attack with all we have left.""*

The United Planets soldiers took Gancelot's orders to heart. And they charged the remaining enemies with savage determination. However, as they gained momentum, a fleet of Nemesis ships appeared overhead, reinforcing the enemy. 

""Oh, no,"" Gancelot said, filling with despair.

The Nemesis ships rained plasma bolts on the United Planets soldiers, and as their infantry landed on the battlefield, they retreated again. Daisy, Everton, and Sarah looked on in horror from the onslaught. Still, Daisy noticed one of the bolts heading toward them.

*""Sarah, dodge.""*

Sarah spotted the attack and ran away. It missed her, but the shockwaves from its impact sent them all flying. And Daisy, Everton, and Sarah landed on the ground, barely conscious.

As Daisy struggled back to her feet, the ground started to shake. Swiftly, a massive crack formed from the plasma blast revealed a sewer system leading to the Nemesis fortress. 

""Everton, I think there's still a chance for us to win this. But I need you and Sarah's help.""

""Are you sure you can handle more of this carnage?""

With a moment of thought, Daisy nodded with a face of determination. Again, she believed she was ready. However, Daisy may have been truthful with herself this time. She was already free of a bit of her naivety, spending a short time on the battlefield. Still, the young woman held her beliefs in the sacredness of life, but now Daisy was pragmatic. Now, she knew running away from the killings would only prolong the defilement. Now, she understood the sacrifices she had to make in the present for the bright future she wanted.

One thousand posts. Ten thousand slides.  
  
A deluge of angry rants, with myths debunked, foes slain, and conventional wisdom shattered.  
  
My incessant yelling into the online void, with countless hours of reading, writing, researching; cutting, cropping, and kerning; blowing my mind every day with the latest, greatest data, and then scrambling to put it all back into my head, and onto a page.  
  
It’s been a wild ride, but I’ll be honest –  
  
TheTinMen was never meant for you, it was originally meant for me.  
  
Something of a secret weapon so to speak; one quite literally held under the table, as I went to war with my fellow lefties, both friend and family alike; in pubs, clubs, and coffee shops; at dinner parties, nights out, and on lunch breaks; it was a page that armed me with the best data, to twist my opponents into knots, within the fiercest battle of them all – one for our men and boys.

It’s a comfort addiction.,"I don’t know about everyone — I can only speak for myself. When I first started promoting my workbook on unbreakable discipline, I kept thinking: *“I need motivation to get this going.”* And maybe that’s where most people start too. But here’s the truth:  
If you want discipline, you have to **forget motivation**.  
Motivation is like sugar — sweet at first, gives you a rush, but eventually, it crashes you. You start asking:  
*“Why am I even doing this?”*  
*“Do I really need this?”*

That’s not laziness. That’s addiction — addiction to your **comfort zone**. And your comfort zone is the **enemy** of discipline, personal growth, and productivity. You’re not lazy. You just want an easier path to get disciplined. But here’s the hard truth: **Discipline starts with discomfort.** Let me tell you about myself.  
I created a workbook — not just some digital product, but a real tool that focuses on building:

* Discipline
* Mental toughness
* Emotional control
* Real productivity

At first, I thought, *“I’ll just DM people struggling with discipline — they’ll get it.”* Then I told myself, *“I’ll start tomorrow.”* But I forgot something important: **I need to follow my own workbook before expecting others to.** It’s been 11 days. No sales yet. Maybe I’ll fail. Maybe people want change — but they don’t have the courage to face discomfort. Still, I choose discomfort over laziness. Even if I’m criticized, ignored, banned, or fail completely — I’ll keep going. I know deep down, a lot of people want to build discipline, get mentally tougher, and take control of their emotions. But most are still caught by laziness and comfort. This workbook helped me escape that trap — and I’m not here to sell it to you. I’m just telling you the truth.

If you’re ready to stop chasing motivation and start building discipline, the link is in my profile.

The pictures show the damage to the table leg that has broken.

Does anyone know where I could get either a repair of the broken leg or a replacement made? ",3,1746787577.0,bristol,0,1.0,False

I rarely receive anything from your country, so it made me so happy when I saw it! :D Also, thank you—your name is truly beautiful. I’m always happy to learn more about different cultures!
* u/zesty_bitches – Hii, I wish you lots of success in your studies!! Thank you for the lovely flowery card and the surprise! At first, I was like “Ooo, a tea bag,” but then I opened the little envelope inside the envelope and gasped—wow, a bunch of stickers!! Thank you so much, it made my day 💖💖
* u/Brixxii – Hii, yes, the sakura blossoms are absolutely beautiful—we also have some here in the city. I love spring: you can hear the birds singing, see all the colorful flowers, everything is so green, and the breeze is refreshing. Thank you for the beautiful pink handmade card—I love it! And thank you for the cute stickers! We don’t have such adorable ones here 💖☀️
* u/Moose-Maleficent – Hii, thank you so much for your Easter card—it’s so adorable! I really like Tatty Teddy, and those little Easter confetti bits were such a sweet touch!
* u/Thick-Combination785 – Thank you so much for the vintage-style Pisa Tower card—I love it! I really believe you’ll one day make it to Korea and enjoy the food and the culture there!
* u/readyjettsetgo– Thank you so much for the adorable pink card. And I totally agree—dancing in the rain or staying cozy with a hot coffee or hot chocolate by the window while reading a book or writing postcards is the best thing to do when it rains 💖💖☀️
* u/hardlybroken1 – Woohoo, another cartoon card for my collection! Thank you so much for the handmade Cinderella one—I really loved that story when I was a kid!
* u/Ok-Lawfulness6660 – Hii, thank you so much for the penguin card—it’s incredibly cute!! Your name is also beautiful—I’d love to know the meaning behind it 💖 That penguin plushie you mentioned sounds adorable! Back in secondary school, we had our class mascot—a plush penguin with a little hat and scarf 🐧 The meaning of my name: it originally comes from the Hebrew Elisheva (אֱלִישֶׁבַע‎), which means “God is my oath (I believe).”
* u/clashvalley – Thank you for telling me about Durham—it sounds like such a beautiful place! Now I want to visit too!! 😂
* u/etherealcalc – Thank you for the Exit Game postcard! I hope you successfully won that online war :D",7,1746787530.0,RandomActsofCards,11,1.0,False

So I tried to order it again yesterday and it was way different and I didn’t really enjoy it. So my question is, how do I order it appropriately so that the barista understands? 

Caramel Frappuccino but I want it without the coffee. I want the dark caramel drizzle instead of the clear syrup/flavor. And I want it blended with vanilla sweet cold foam. 

It was such a good drink and I want it again, I just want to know how to say all that without sounding like I’m crazy lol ",1,1746787320.0,starbucksbaristas,3,1.0,False
1kifddb,https://youtu.be/_Nmk_F6Bkuw,3 Very Scary TRUE Train Station Terror Wrong Horror Stories,"**""The Shadow on Platform 7"":**

I used to think train stations were magical. The whistle of a locomotive, the clatter of wheels on tracks, the way people came and went with stories I’d never know—it felt alive. I was 19, a porter at Union Station in 1910, a small town stop in Illinois. The station was old, its high ceilings draped in cobwebs, stained glass windows casting red and gold light at dusk. The wooden floors creaked under my boots, and the air smelled of coal and varnish. But at night, it changed. Shadows grew long, cold spots lingered in corners, and every sound echoed like a warning. After that summer, I never went near a train again. This isn’t about ghosts or spirits. It’s about a man, a killer, and what I saw is true, pieced together from my memories and what the police dug up later.It was August, the kind of heat that made your shirt stick to your back. I worked the late shift, sweeping platforms, hauling luggage, locking up. Union Station was quiet after 9 p.m., just me, Mr. Smith, the station master, and Mrs. Johnson, who manned the ticket booth. Mr. Smith was a wiry man, maybe 60, with a bushy mustache and a limp from the Civil War. He’d sit in his office, polishing his pocket watch, barking orders. “Danny, clear those benches!” he’d say, but he’d slip me a nickel sometimes, so I didn’t mind. Mrs. Johnson was softer, a widow with gray curls, always offering me a peppermint from a tin on her desk. “You’re a good boy, Danny,” she’d say, smiling.That night, around 10 p.m., I was on Platform 3, sweeping cigarette butts and dust. The air was thick, the platform lights buzzing faintly. A freight train had just passed, its rumble fading into the distance, leaving the station silent. Then I heard it—a scream, sharp and raw, from the ticket office across the concourse. It cut off fast, like someone choked it out. My broom clattered to the ground, my heart slamming in my chest. I ran, my boots pounding the wooden floor, the empty station swallowing the sound.The ticket office door was half-open, a single bulb swinging overhead. I pushed it and froze. Mrs. Johnson was on the floor, her eyes wide and empty, a telephone cord wrapped tight around her neck. Her tin of peppermints had spilled, candies scattered like confetti. My legs shook, and I gagged, the smell of blood hitting me. “Mrs. Johnson?” I whispered, knowing she wouldn’t answer. Then I heard footsteps—slow, heavy, deliberate—coming from the back office where Mr. Smith worked.“Mr. Smith?” I called, my voice barely a croak. No reply, just those footsteps, closer now. I stepped forward, my hands trembling, and peered into the office. Mr. Smith was slumped over his desk, his head a mess of blood and bone. A hammer, the kind we used to fix loose boards, lay beside him, stained red. His pocket watch ticked faintly, dangling from his vest. I backed away, my heel catching a chair, and it crashed to the floor. The footsteps stopped. I didn’t wait—I ran, out to the platform, yelling for help, my voice lost in the wind howling through the station’s eaves.I found a phone in the baggage room, my fingers fumbling as I dialed the police. They arrived in minutes, their lanterns cutting through the dark, boots echoing like gunshots. “Stay back, kid,” Officer Reynolds said, his face pale as he saw the bodies. His partner, a younger guy named Tate, took my statement. “You see anyone? Hear anything odd before the scream?” I told them about the footsteps, how they sounded calm, not rushed. “Could be a drifter,” Tate muttered, glancing at Reynolds. “We’ve had reports—trouble along the rail line.”The town was in a panic the next day. Folks crowded the general store, whispering about robbery or revenge. But nothing was taken—not the cash in the ticket drawer, not Mr. Smith’s watch. I stayed home, my ma fussing over me, but I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing those footsteps, seeing Mrs. Johnson’s eyes. I went back to work a week later, though every creak made me jump. The station felt different, like it was holding its breath. Platforms were empty, passengers scarce. I’d catch myself staring at shadows, expecting them to move.That’s when Detective Harlan Ford showed up. He was tall, maybe 40, with a sharp jaw and eyes that looked like they’d seen too much. He found me scrubbing benches outside, the sun low and red. “You’re Danny, the porter?” he asked, lighting a cigarette. I nodded, wiping sweat from my forehead. “I’m from Chicago. Heard you found the bodies. Walk me through it.” His voice was calm, but it had an edge, like he was hunting something.I told him everything—the scream, the cord, the hammer, the footsteps. My voice shook, and I kept glancing at the tracks, half-expecting someone to step out. Ford listened, blowing smoke, then leaned close. “This ain’t the first. I’ve been tracking murders like this—station workers, passengers, all along the railroads. Six so far, maybe more. Always near a full moon.”My stomach dropped. I remembered the almanac on Mr. Smith’s desk, how he’d marked the moon phases. “You think it’s the same guy?” I asked, my throat tight. Ford nodded. “He’s smart. Uses the trains to move, hits a town, then disappears. Next full moon’s in two days. We’re gonna catch him.”I wanted to say no, to run home and hide, but Ford’s eyes locked on mine, and I felt trapped. He said they’d spread a rumor about a “valuable shipment” arriving by freight, hoping to draw the killer out. I’d be bait, keeping the station open late, while Ford and two officers hid in the freight yard. “You just act normal,” Ford said. “We’ll handle the rest.”The night of the full moon, I was a wreck. The station was dark, the platform lights flickering, casting jagged shadows. I swept Platform 7, my hands sweaty, a wrench tucked in my coat pocket. The air was cold, despite the summer heat, and the wind carried a low moan, like the station was grieving. I kept checking my watch—11 p.m., then 11:30. Nothing but silence, broken by the occasional hoot of an owl.Then I saw it—a shadow moving near the tracks, just beyond the light. It wasn’t a passenger; no one came this late. I gripped the wrench, my pulse pounding in my ears. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice thin. The shadow paused, then stepped closer. It was a man, thin, in a long dark coat, his face hidden under a wide hat. He held something, long and glinting. A knife.“Ford!” I shouted, stumbling back. The man moved fast, his boots silent on the platform. I swung the wrench, but he dodged, grabbing my arm. His grip was like steel, his breath hot and sour. “Quiet, boy,” he hissed, raising the knife. His eyes gleamed under the hat, wild and empty, like an animal’s. I kicked, catching his shin, and he cursed, loosening his hold.Ford burst from the shadows, tackling him. They hit the platform hard, the knife skittering away. The man pulled another blade from his coat, slashing Ford’s shoulder. Ford grunted, blood soaking his shirt, but he held on, wrestling for control. I didn’t think—I swung the wrench, catching the man’s head with a sickening crack. He collapsed, limp. Officers Tate and Reynolds ran up, cuffing him, their lanterns shaking.They pulled off his hat, and I nearly dropped the wrench. It was Tommy Wilkins, a kid I’d known from town. He’d worked at the station a year back, quiet, always watching people, his smile too sharp. I never thought he’d be a killer. Ford, clutching his shoulder, spat blood. “Good hit, kid,” he said, voice rough.The police dragged Tommy away. He confessed later, said he’d killed eight people—station workers, drifters, even a conductor—using the trains to slip between towns. They hanged him that October, the town watching in silence. Ford survived but left Chicago, or so I heard. I quit the station, moved to a factory job in Springfield. I still hear train whistles at night, and I see Tommy’s eyes, that wild gleam. The station’s still there, they say, but I’ll never go back. Some places carry evil, not because of spirits, but because of men who walk among us, waiting for the moon to rise.





**""The Axeman of Millfield Station"":**

I’m Joe, and I’ve been working the night shift at Millfield train station for two years. It’s a small, crumbling building in a sleepy town, just a single platform with a warped wooden bench that creaks when you sit on it. The ticket booth smells like stale coffee and mildew, and the walls are covered in faded posters for trains that don’t run anymore. Outside, the platform stretches into darkness, surrounded by empty fields that seem to swallow sound. At night, the only noises are the occasional hoot of an owl or the low rumble of a freight train passing through. October’s cold bites through my jacket, and the dim yellow lights flicker, casting long shadows that make the place feel alive in a way I don’t like. I used to think it was just lonely. Now, I know it’s something worse.It was a Thursday, around 11 p.m., and I was sweeping the platform, my boots scraping against the cracked concrete. My breath fogged in the crisp air, and the chill made my fingers ache around the broom handle. The last passenger train had left at 9, and the station was dead quiet. Earlier that day, Sheriff Tomkins had stopped by, his heavy boots thudding on the wood floor of the booth. He’s a big man, always chewing gum, with a face like weathered leather. But that day, his eyes were sharp, and he wasn’t smiling.“Joe, you hear about those murders?” he asked, leaning on the counter, his badge glinting under the fluorescent light.I stopped sweeping and leaned the broom against the wall. “What murders?”He popped his gum, then spit it into the trash can. “Families, out near railroad lines. Three in the last month, all within a day’s ride from here. Someone’s breaking in, using an axe. No robbery, no reason—just kills ‘em. Covers the bodies after, like they’re laying ‘em to rest. Sick bastard.”My stomach churned, and I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling the hairs stand up. “An axe? Like, chopping wood?”“Worse,” he said, lowering his voice. “Clean cuts, precise. They don’t fight back. He picks houses with no dogs, always near tracks. Found the last family—Harrisons—two weeks ago. Kids and all.”“You think he’s coming here?” I asked, glancing out the booth’s grimy window toward the dark platform.Tomkins shrugged, but his jaw tightened. “Could be. Just keep your eyes open, Joe. You see anything weird, call me. Don’t play hero.”I nodded, but his words clung to me like damp clothes. That night, as I swept, every creak of the bench, every rustle in the fields, felt like a warning. The freight yard beyond the platform was the worst—a maze of rusty boxcars and overgrown weeds, shrouded in shadow. It was where old trains went to die, and I avoided it when I could. But I kept thinking about what Tomkins said: near the tracks.I was about to head inside when I heard footsteps, slow and heavy, crunching on the gravel by the freight yard. My heart jumped, and I gripped the broom so tight my knuckles hurt. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice thin and shaky in the cold air.No answer. The footsteps stopped, and for a moment, it was just silence. Then came a sound—a low, deliberate scrape, scrape, scrape, like metal dragging across stone. My mouth went dry. I fumbled for the flashlight on my belt, my hands clumsy with fear, and aimed the beam toward the yard. It caught a man, standing by a rusted boxcar, maybe thirty feet away. He was tall, gaunt, with a face so hollow his cheeks looked like they’d been carved out. His dark eyes glinted in the light, and his long coat hung off him, flapping in the breeze. In his hand was an axe, its blade catching the flashlight’s glow as he ran it along a sharpening stone—scrape, scrape, scrape.“Hey!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “What the hell are you doing?”He didn’t look up, just kept sharpening, the sound slicing through the night. My legs felt like they were glued to the platform, but I couldn’t look away. “I’m calling the sheriff!” I said, reaching for my phone with trembling fingers.That’s when he stopped. He tilted his head, slow and unnatural, like he was listening to something I couldn’t hear. His eyes locked on mine, and they were empty, like staring into a well. Then he turned, quick as a snake, and slipped into the shadows of the freight yard, his coat blending with the darkness.I stood there, heart hammering, my flashlight shaking in my hand. The air felt heavier, like it was pressing down on me. I wanted to run, to lock myself in the booth, but then I heard another voice, soft and nervous, from behind me.“Excuse me? Is the 11:30 train on time?”I spun around, nearly dropping the flashlight. It was a woman, maybe in her 40s, standing on the platform. She had a knitted scarf wrapped tight around her neck, and her eyes kept darting to the shadows. Her hands twisted together, like she was trying to keep them still.“Uh, yeah,” I said, forcing my voice to steady. “It’s on time. Should be here in ten minutes.”She nodded, but her smile was tight. “Good. I’m waiting for my husband. He’s on that train.” She hesitated, then added, “I heard about… those murders. Is it safe here?”I swallowed, my throat dry. I couldn’t tell her about the man, not when she looked so scared already. “Sheriff’s keeping an eye on things,” I said, hoping it sounded convincing. “Just stay near the lights, okay? You’ll be fine.”She hugged her coat closer. “Okay. Thank you.”I watched her sit on the bench, her shoulders hunched, and I felt a pang of guilt. I should’ve said something, warned her, but what could I say? There’s a guy with an axe out there, and he might be a killer? Instead, I stayed close, pretending to check the schedule board while keeping one eye on the freight yard.The 11:30 train came and went, its whistle piercing the night. The woman’s husband got off, a stocky guy with a graying beard and a duffel bag. He hugged her so tight she almost stumbled, and they hurried to their car, their footsteps fading into the dark. I was alone again, the station quieter than a graveyard.But I couldn’t stop thinking about that man—his hollow face, the axe, the way he’d looked at me. Against every instinct screaming to stay put, I grabbed my flashlight and headed to the freight yard. The air there was thick with the smell of rust and rotting wood, and the boxcars loomed like giant, silent beasts. My boots crunched on the gravel, too loud in the stillness. I swept the flashlight over the tracks, my pulse thudding in my ears.Near the boxcar where he’d stood, I saw something on the ground—a scrap of paper, crumpled and stained with dirt. I knelt, my knees sinking into the cold earth, and picked it up. It was a list, written in shaky pencil: Harrisons, no dog, Maple St. – done. Thompsons, no dog, Oak Rd. – done. Millers, no dog, Elm St. – next. My blood turned to ice. I knew those names. The Harrisons and Thompsons had been on the news, slaughtered in their homes, just like Tomkins said. The Millers lived a mile from here, right by the tracks.I stumbled back to the booth, my hands shaking so bad I could barely dial. “Tomkins, it’s Joe,” I said when he picked up. “I saw a guy in the freight yard with an axe. He dropped a list—names, addresses. It’s got the Harrisons, Thompsons, and… the Millers are next.”Tomkins’ voice was sharp, all business. “Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”He got there in ten minutes, his cruiser’s lights flashing red and blue across the platform. I handed him the list, and his face went pale as he read it. “Jesus, Joe,” he muttered. “This is… this matches the victims. Where’d he go?”I pointed to the freight yard, my throat tight. “He disappeared out there.”Tomkins called for backup, and soon two deputies arrived, their radios crackling. We searched the yard together, our flashlights cutting through the dark. The boxcars were cold to the touch, their doors rusted shut. We checked every shadow, every corner, but found nothing—no man, no axe. Just a single footprint in the dirt, too smudged to make out. The air smelled faintly of oil, and I kept hearing that scrape, scrape, scrape in my head, like it was stuck there.By dawn, the search was over. Tomkins drove me home, the sky gray and heavy with clouds. “We’ll keep looking,” he said, his hands tight on the wheel. “You did good, Joe. Might’ve scared him off. We’ll check on the Millers, make sure they’re safe.”I nodded, but I felt hollow. “What if he comes back?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.Tomkins didn’t answer right away. “Just keep your eyes open,” he said finally. “And lock your doors.”I still work the night shift, though I dread it now. The station hasn’t changed—same creaky bench, same flickering lights—but it feels different, like it’s waiting for something. Every rustle in the fields, every shadow on the platform, makes my heart race. I keep my flashlight close, and I check the freight yard every night, half-expecting to see those hollow eyes staring back. Sometimes, when the wind’s quiet, I swear I hear that axe sharpening again, out in the dark. They never caught him, and I can’t shake the feeling he’s still out there, watching, waiting. I wonder if I stopped him that night—or if I just made him choose a new name for his list.





**""Mist of Murder at Dover Priory"":**

I woke to a bitter chill on May 1, 1868, the kind that seeps into your bones and lingers. Dover Priory Station was my world, a sprawling maze of iron tracks, hissing steam, and hurried footsteps. At sixteen, I was just an apprentice porter, still clumsy with heavy trunks and shy around passengers. The station was alive most days, with the clatter of train wheels and the shouts of vendors hawking tea and newspapers. But that morning, as I stepped onto the platform, a thick mist hung low, curling around the gas lamps like ghostly hands. The air felt wrong, heavy with a silence that made my stomach twist.My boots crunched on the frost-dusted stones as I hurried to the porter’s room, a cramped space that smelled of coal dust and old tobacco. Thomas Wells was already there, slumped on a splintered bench by the stove. He was seventeen, a full porter, with sharp features and a quick grin that could charm anyone. I looked up to him like a brother, always eager for his stories about the sailors he’d met or the tricks he’d played on grumpy passengers. But today, his face was gray, his eyes red and sunken, like he’d been staring into the dark all night.“Morning, Thomas,” I said, blowing on my hands to warm them. The stove was barely glowing, doing little against the damp cold. “You look like death warmed over. Bad night?”He glanced up, his lips twitching into a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Morning, James. Yeah, didn’t sleep much. Too much on my mind.”I frowned but let it go. Thomas could be cagey when he wanted, and I wasn’t one to pry. I hung my coat on a rusty hook and grabbed my cap, the stiff wool scratching my forehead. We stepped out to start our shift, the platform buzzing with early travelers. A woman in a velvet bonnet clutched her ticket, her eyes darting to the timetable. A man with a waxed mustache barked at me to hurry with his leather trunk. I hauled it to the luggage car, my arms straining, while Thomas worked nearby, his movements slow and jerky, like a puppet with half its strings cut.He was off all morning. He fumbled a crate of apples, the wood splintering as it hit the platform, red fruit rolling into the mist. “Damn it,” he muttered, kicking a stray apple into the tracks. He kept glancing at the stationmaster’s office, a small brick building with a single window, its glass smudged with soot. Mr. Edward Walsh was inside, his broad silhouette moving behind the curtain. Walsh was the heart of Dover Priory, a man in his forties with a voice like gravel and a stare that could make you feel two inches tall. He was strict but fair, and I admired how he kept the chaos of the station in line. Still, I tiptoed around him, always checking my work twice.By mid-morning, the mist had thinned, but the air stayed cold, sharp in my lungs. Thomas and I were stacking parcels near the ticket booth, the paper labels crinkling under my fingers. He was muttering to himself, his breath puffing in quick clouds. His hands shook as he checked his pocket watch for the third time in ten minutes, its brass case glinting dully.“Thomas, what’s wrong?” I asked, keeping my voice low so the other porters wouldn’t hear. “You’re acting like someone’s out camto get you.”He froze, his fingers tightening around the watch. For a moment, I thought he wouldn’t answer. Then he let out a ragged sigh, his shoulders slumping. “I’m in trouble, James. Bad trouble. Got myself into debt. Gambling. I owe money to some rough types, and they’re not the kind to wait.”My mouth went dry. “Gambling? Thomas, how’d you get mixed up in that?”He rubbed his face, his nails scraping against stubble. “It was stupid. Started with a few card games down at the pub. Thought I was clever, you know? Won a bit at first. Then I kept losing, and now I’m in deep. They’re saying they’ll break my knees if I don’t pay by tomorrow.”I stared at him, my heart thudding. “You’ve got to tell someone. Mr. Walsh might help, give you a loan or something.”His eyes widened, pure panic flashing across his face. “No! Walsh would sack me faster than you can blink. Or worse, he’d call the police. I just need money, James. Quick.”He glanced at the stationmaster’s office again, and a sick feeling curled in my gut. That office held the safe, a heavy iron box bolted to the floor, stuffed with ticket earnings and payroll cash. “Thomas,” I said, my voice barely a whisper, “you’re not thinking of stealing, are you?”He laughed, a sharp, brittle sound that echoed off the platform. “Stealing? Me? Come on, James, don’t be daft. I’m not that far gone.”But his eyes wouldn’t meet mine, and his laugh sounded forced, like he was trying to convince himself as much as me. I wanted to believe him—Thomas was my friend, the one who’d shown me how to sneak an extra biscuit from the station canteen—but doubt gnawed at me. I turned back to the parcels, my fingers clumsy on the twine, my mind racing with what he’d said.Around noon, the platform was packed, the air thick with coal smoke and the chatter of passengers. A train screeched into the station, its brakes squealing, steam billowing like a dragon’s breath. Mr. Walsh stepped out of his office, his black coat buttoned tight, his face set in a scowl. “Wells!” he barked, his voice cutting through the noise. “In my office. Now.”Thomas flinched like he’d been struck. He wiped his sweaty palms on his trousers and followed Walsh, his steps stiff, like a man walking to the gallows. I was nearby, sorting luggage tags, the paper slippery in my hands. Curiosity got the better of me, and I edged closer to the office, pretending to adjust a stack of crates. The door was ajar, just enough for me to hear their voices.“You’ve got some explaining to do, Wells,” Walsh said, his tone cold and hard. “I checked the books this morning. Fifty pounds missing from the safe. Fifty pounds! And you’re the only one with a key besides me.”Thomas’s voice was high, trembling. “Sir, I didn’t take it. I swear, I wouldn’t do that.”“Don’t lie to me, boy,” Walsh snapped. I could picture him leaning over his desk, his eyes boring into Thomas. “I know about your gambling. You’re in debt up to your ears. You thought you could steal from the station and I wouldn’t notice?”“Sir, please,” Thomas begged, his words tumbling out. “You’ve got it wrong. I didn’t touch the money. I’d never betray you.”“Enough!” Walsh roared. “I’ve had it with your excuses. I’m calling the police unless you confess right now.”My breath caught, my hands freezing on the crate. I wanted to run, to pretend I hadn’t heard, but my feet were rooted to the spot. Through the crack in the door, I saw Thomas’s shadow shift. His hand moved to his coat pocket, slow and deliberate, and my heart slammed against my ribs. I didn’t know what he was reaching for, but every nerve in my body screamed danger.Then came the bang—a gunshot, loud as thunder, splitting the world apart. The sound echoed through the station, drowning out the train whistles and passenger chatter. Screams erupted, sharp and panicked. A woman dropped her handbag, apples and coins spilling across the platform. A child wailed, clinging to his mother’s skirts. My ears rang, my legs trembling as I stumbled toward the office, my mind refusing to believe what I’d heard.I shoved the door open, and the sight hit me like a punch. Mr. Walsh lay crumpled on the floor, blood pooling beneath him, staining his gray waistcoat a deep, ugly red. His eyes were wide open, staring blankly at the ceiling, his mouth frozen in a grimace. Thomas stood over him, a revolver shaking in his hand, smoke curling from the barrel like a snake. His face was ashen, his eyes wild, like he was trapped in a nightmare he couldn’t wake from.“Thomas,” I choked out, my voice barely a whisper. “What… what did you do?”He looked at me, his mouth working soundlessly for a moment. “I didn’t mean to, James,” he stammered. “He was going to ruin me. Send me to prison. I just wanted to scare him, I swear.”But the blood spreading across the floor said otherwise. Mr. Walsh’s chest didn’t rise, his hands didn’t twitch. He was gone, and Thomas had done it. My friend, the one who’d shared his tobacco and laughed with me under the stars, was a killer.Thomas dropped the gun, the metal clattering on the wood. He bolted past me, his shoulder slamming into mine as he ran. I heard shouts—other porters, passengers, someone yelling, “Stop him!” Boots pounded the platform, and within minutes, they had him. Two burly ticket inspectors tackled Thomas near the station’s edge, pinning him to the ground as he thrashed and sobbed. The police arrived soon after, their dark uniforms cutting through the crowd, handcuffs glinting as they hauled Thomas away.The station was chaos. Passengers milled about, whispering, some crying. A constable covered Mr. Walsh’s body with a tarp, but I could still see the blood seeping through, dark and glossy. I was questioned, my voice shaking as I told them what I’d heard, what I’d seen. They wrote it down, their faces grim, and sent me home. The platform was closed off, trains diverted, the station falling into an eerie hush.That night, I lay awake in my narrow bed, the gunshot echoing in my head. I saw Mr. Walsh’s lifeless eyes, Thomas’s trembling hands. I kept thinking about our talk, how I’d suspected something was wrong. Why hadn’t I said anything? Why hadn’t I warned Mr. Walsh or told another porter? Guilt twisted in my chest, sharp as a knife.The newspapers devoured the story. “Murder at Dover Priory!” the headlines screamed, with sketches of the station and Thomas’s haunted face. His trial was swift, barely a month later. He claimed it was an accident, that he’d only meant to threaten Walsh, but the evidence was brutal. The revolver was his, found hidden in his locker, wrapped in an old rag. Witnesses testified about his gambling debts, his arguments with Walsh over late shifts and docked pay. The jury took less than an hour to find him guilty.On August 13, 1868, Thomas Wells was hanged at Maidstone Prison. They said it was the first execution done privately, no jeering crowd, just a few officials in a cold stone room. I didn’t go—couldn’t face it. I kept remembering Thomas’s laugh, how he’d ruffle my hair and call me “kid.” Now he was gone, his life snuffed out because of one desperate moment.Dover Priory reopened, but it was never the same. The other porters avoided the office, whispering about bad luck. I didn’t believe in curses, but I couldn’t walk past that door without my skin crawling. The bloodstain was scrubbed away, but I swore I could still see it, a faint shadow under the new rug. Late at night, when the station was empty, the wind whistled through the platform, sounding like whispers, and the creak of the rafters felt like footsteps trailing me. I told myself it was nothing, just my mind playing tricks, but the fear clung to me like damp cloth.The worst part was the guilt. I’d seen Thomas’s desperation, heard his talk of debts. I could’ve spoken up, done something. Maybe Mr. Walsh would still be alive, barking orders, keeping the station in line. Maybe Thomas would still be here, joking by the stove. But I’d stayed silent, and that silence had cost two lives. I carried it with me, heavier than any trunk I’d ever hauled, a weight that never eased.The trains kept running, passengers came and went, but for me, Dover Priory was a place of shadows. Every whistle, every clang of the signal bell, reminded me of that cold morning when the world turned upside down, when my friend’s fear became a horror I’d never forget.",1,1746787276.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1kifck2,https://v.redd.it/va1v66u4jqze1,What’s the Best Way to Forget a Bad Week?,"Practical, Science-Backed Ways to Reset and Move On 

Some weeks feel like they were designed just to test your patience. The emails won’t stop, you spill coffee on yourself, your WiFi crashes in an important meeting, and somehow, the universe decides this is also the perfect time for an existential crisis.

So, how do you shake it off, reset, and move on without carrying that stress into the next week? Let’s break it down.

1. Accept That the Week Sucked (But Don’t Dwell on It)
Why It Works:
Trying to force yourself to be positive when you feel terrible just makes it worse. Instead, acknowledge it sucked—then let it go.

📌 How to Do It:
✅ Say it out loud: “This week was rough. But it’s over.”  I lost my power for eight days after a storm last week. I'm still recovering from too much coffee.
✅ Write down the worst moments. Getting it out of your head stops the mental loop.
✅ Rip up the list. Symbolic? Yes. Effective? Also yes.

💡 Example: Studies show that physically writing down worries helps the brain process them so they stop replaying.

🔑 Takeaway: Own the bad week—but don’t let it own you.

2. Do a “Brain Dump” to Reset Your Mind
Why It Works:
A bad week often leaves mental clutter—unfinished tasks, overthinking, stress. A brain dump clears space for a fresh start.

📌 How to Brain Dump:
✅ Set a timer for 5 minutes.
✅ Write down EVERYTHING on your mind—stress, tasks, random thoughts.
✅ Sort it out: What needs action? What can you ignore?

💡 Example: Research shows that externalizing worries (writing them down) reduces stress and increases problem-solving ability.

🔑 Takeaway: Unload your mental baggage so you don’t carry it into next week.

3. Move Your Body (Seriously, Just Do It)
Why It Works:
Stress gets trapped in the body—movement shakes it loose. Even 10 minutes of exercise can boost mood and reset your mindset.

📌 Best Ways to Move On (Literally):
✅ Walk outside → Nature + movement = instant reset.
✅ Dance like no one’s watching → Because no one is.
✅ Boxing or punching a pillow → For when the week really did you dirty.

💡 Example: Exercise releases dopamine and endorphins, which help counteract stress hormones.

🔑 Takeaway: Your brain can’t let go of stress if your body is holding onto it. Move.

4. Do a “Mini Dopamine Reset” (AKA, Give Your Brain a Break)
Why It Works:
Bad weeks fry your brain’s reward system—too much stress, too much stimulation, not enough real rest.

📌 How to Reset Dopamine Levels:
✅ No social media for a few hours → (Doomscrolling keeps stress active.)
✅ Listen to music, but not while multitasking → Just enjoy it.
✅ Do something with your hands → Drawing, puzzles, Legos, cooking—anything physical and screen-free.

💡 Example: A 2021 study found that short breaks from digital overload improve focus, mood, and mental clarity.

🔑 Takeaway: Give your brain space to breathe. Dopamine will thank you.

5. Change Your Scenery (Even If It’s Just a Coffee Shop)
Why It Works:
A bad week makes you feel stuck. Changing your environment tricks your brain into a fresh start.

📌 Simple Ways to Switch It Up:
✅ Go somewhere new → A park, café, museum—anywhere different.
✅ Rearrange your space → Even moving your desk refreshes your mindset.
✅ Take a short trip → A weekend getaway reboots mental energy.

💡 Example: Studies show that novelty increases dopamine, making you feel more refreshed and motivated.

🔑 Takeaway: New environment = new mindset. Break the routine.

6. Do One Thing That Makes You Feel Accomplished
Why It Works:
Bad weeks make you feel powerless—but small wins restore control.

📌 Quick “Win” Ideas:
✅ Clean or declutter one small space.
✅ Do a 5-minute workout.
✅ Make a to-do list for next week—then cross off “making a list.”

💡 Example: Completing even a small task gives a dopamine boost, making you feel productive instead of stuck.

🔑 Takeaway: A tiny win can flip your mindset from “stressed” to “back in control.”

7. Laugh. No, Seriously—Find Something Funny.
Why It Works:
Laughter literally rewires the brain, reducing stress and boosting mood instantly.

📌 Instant Mood-Lifting Ideas:
✅ Watch a dumb comedy or stand-up special. I go back to the classics, Robin Williams or George Carlin never fail.
✅ Look up “funniest Amazon reviews” (trust me, gold).
✅ Call that one friend who always makes you laugh.

💡 Example: Studies show that laughter lowers cortisol (the stress hormone) and increases feel-good endorphins.

🔑 Takeaway: A bad week can’t compete with a good laugh.

8. End the Week with an “Anti-Stress Ritual”
Why It Works:
Ending the week intentionally makes it easier to let go and move on.

📌 Create a Simple End-of-Week Ritual:
✅ Write down one good thing from the week (even if it was tiny).
✅ Take a hot shower, light a candle, or listen to music—whatever relaxes you.
✅ Do something small to mark the transition into a fresh start.

💡 Example: Many high performers use routines to “close” a stressful week, helping them mentally reset.

🔑 Takeaway: Your brain needs closure. Create a ritual to end the week on your terms.

Final Verdict: How to Forget a Bad Week Fast
✔ Acknowledge it sucked, then let it go.
✔ Brain dump stress onto paper so it stops looping.
✔ Move your body to clear out tension.
✔ Give your brain a dopamine reset (no doomscrolling).
✔ Change your scenery—fresh environment = fresh mindset.
✔ Find one small win to restore control.
✔ Laugh (science says it’s medicine).
✔ Close the week with a simple ritual to reset.

🔥 So, here’s your challenge: Pick one thing from this list and do it today. The week may have been bad, but you don’t have to carry it into the next one.

This has only happened in the last 2 weeks and I’m so confused on what to do!,"TLDR: me (f21) and my (m24) friend recently took the next step and I’m conflicted on if there is some feelings there on his side, I’m really starting to fall for him and it’s scary as I don’t want to ruin a good friendship.

I’ll give some background, me (f21) and my (m24) friend have known each-other roughly around 2 years now and have been good friends since. From random meet ups in coffee shops and nice walks we’ve always hit it off. From the day I met him it felt like I’d known him a life time.

Over the first few months of talking things developed and became extremely flirty over text, mostly when we’d both had a drink. This continued for nearly 2 years up until recently when I asked him out for a few drinks, he’d not been too well and I didn’t think he’d agree but surprisingly he did. After spending the entire night talking and laughing we went back to mine and put a film on. One thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping together, it was the best night of my life and honestly I felt so comfortable with him. After that he cuddled up to me and I fell asleep. Sometime in the early hours he got up and left but did text me so when I’d wake up I’d see it haha. Think he knew I’d be a little hungover.

Forwarding on we spontaneously decided to go on a mini break nothing crazy just one night, we sat down had a few drinks and just chatted away, the night was perfect and even when we were silent it was comfortable. He was constantly checking in to see if I was warm and happy, helped me set up my little pitch so I was cosy and honestly it was perfect.

Here’s where I’m lost, on our little night out the other week we got talking about morals and relationships and he said “if we were together, I’d look after you and provide for you it’s my job” then backtracked and said “but erm I’d do the same for anyone I’m with” then ran off to the toilet a moment later haha. Now I feel like that was a slip of tongue and he let it slip that he does like me.

We both aren’t open people when it comes to talks like that but I am growing more and more fond of him as the days go on. I’ve always liked him but that is getting stronger and I don’t know what to say or if I should say something? This man makes me feel safe and secure for the first time in my life I feel valued and I really don’t want to ruin a good friendship if he doesn’t feel the same.

1kif8of,https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1kif8of/heres_how_i_would_fix_trading_and_taxing_in_eu5/,Here's how I would fix trading and taxing in EU5.,"This is a long article.

I'm going to start off from scratch here.

1. You have locations.
2. Your locations have resources.
3. You lease the resource gathering rights in your directly owned locations to estates. In return, the estates give you (the Crown estate) 20% of the resources extracted. The estates employ laborers into these gathering operations.
4. The 20% is to be considered a part of the Crown Treasury. They are used to run your buildings and such, and selling them allows you to trade a little too, but it is mostly left to the other estates. You can, of course, buy more if you don't have enough.
5. The insane wealth from trade is now entirely reaching the population, as is normal. If you want a piece of the pie, you should, I don't know, consider taxing the estates? This might just make taxing viable.
6. Well, you ask, why not just keep the leasing rights and do it yourself. You can, to be sure. But...let's introduce wages. Obviously, you must pay your laborers, for they are not slaves. Each laborer should be paid...maybe, 0.01 ducats? Expensive business for countries that have thousands upon thousands of laborers. Of course, if there's a certain good you want to be in complete or partial control of (say, lead for gunpowder) and you need way more than 20% of it, then you can keep the leasing rights and hire the laborers yourself, but remember that hiring a measly thousand laborers will cost you ten entire ducats.
7. Involving estates in trade so heavily makes the banning of certain goods more important to estates, and say, the nobles for example, will be angry if you ban the export of gold.
8. Wages must rise along with the ages, but you should be able to bring them down or run them up by bringing down or up the prices of 'essential' goods: wheat, wine, food.
9. Regarding produced goods, I'd say any estate can do as it likes, but if I had to divvy them up, then furniture and pottery go to the peasants. Guns, powder, cannons, ships, and other military related goods can be produced by the Crown, the nobles, and the burghers. But most of it, like glass, books, paper, and such should go to the clergy.

Now, the most important bit. Which estate gets what leasing rights in regard to raw goods?

Generally, I think most food-related things go to the peasants, luxury goods go to the nobles, and industrial/trade-heavy goods go to the burghers.

Let's have a look here.

Here is how I would split the gathering rights by estates.

i) The peasant estate gets the leasing rights for the following:

Wool

Wild Game

Fish

Wheat

Legumes

Wine

Fruits

Saffron

Rice

Maize

Sturdy Grains

Potatoes

Livestock

Olives

Lumber

Sand

Clay

ii) The noble estate gets the leasing rights to the following:

Gold

Silver

Gems

Pearls

Ivory

Marble

Silk

Dyes

Tea

Medicaments

Horses

Elephants

iii) The Burgher (Merchant) class gets the leasing rights to the following:

Stone

Coal

Iron

Copper

Tin

Lead

Incense

Cocoa

Coffee

Fiber Crops

Fur

Salt

Amber

Saltpeter

Alum

Mercury

Cotton

Sugar

In a world that’s more connected than ever, many of us still feel alone. Whether you’re going through a tough time, struggling with mental health, or just need a friend to talk to — you’re not alone.

I’m starting a new Reddit community just for people in Vadodara. It’s a safe, supportive space where anyone can reach out, talk, vent, ask for help, or even meet someone for a coffee or a walk. No judgment. No pressure. Just real people trying to look out for each other.

Who is this for?
	•	Anyone who feels isolated or low
	•	Anyone who wants to make new friends in the city
	•	Anyone willing to offer emotional support or practical help to others
	•	Anyone who believes Vadodara can be a little more human, a little more kind

The goal? To slowly build a tight-knit, trustworthy community where people don’t have to suffer in silence. Whether it’s emotional support, someone to talk to at 2 AM, or a buddy to explore the city with — this group will be here.

Let’s make Vadodara a place where nobody feels like they have to go through life alone.

Interested? Drop a comment or DM. The community goes live soon.

Im writing a collection of short stories (various themes but mostly horror and liminal) but im not quite sure of the quality. Any feedback is really appreciated for both story and form

  
\- It's a beautiful night with a pale full moon in the sky. Moonlight rays bathing the world below in a milky-glass tint. Seated in my chair, I prepare for duty. In this line of work, one must be always sharp and punctual sure to never miss a night. -

Gene was at the end of his shift as a waiter in a lousy cafe'. The last guest had only just left as Gene was cleaning the tables and gathering up the spice shakers to bring in the back of the kitchen. He looked outside the windows, the road was quiet and still.

""The moon is beautiful tonight."" He commented in the silence.

Everyone else already left and was his duty to close shop. The only perceptible sounds were the slow whirring of the ceiling fans and the ticking of the clock signing twenty-three and fifty with its hands. Cold air seeped from under the door, making the man shiver.

""I hate closing. This place gives me the creeps at this hour.""

Gathering up the remaining cutlery, he remembered the old FM radio that was on the counter. Maybe some tunes could have eased his mind. He flicked the power switch; the old contraption emitted a low static sound. Gene reached for the knob and twisted it for a while looking for a station to listen to, and in the middle of the various broadcasts, connected to a channel playing ""sleepwalk"", one of his favorite songs. It was a melancholic song with an aura of mystery to it. Picking up the broom, he brushed the floors listening to it; by then the ceiling fans had stopped whirring and the clock struck twelve.

Suddenly a sharp noise came from the radio.

A cutting static noise that lasted for a few seconds; the lights flickered for a moment and then quiet. A sharp crackle, followed by a gentle, husky voice.

""You are listening to 140.8 FM. The moon is bright, the air is thin and if you are listening to this... well you may be the only one. Tonight's tale comes from a little place in the city that you may or may not know about.""

Gene was surprised to the sudden change of radio station as he kept going with his duties. He looked once again outside the windows; a curtain of darkness falling over the streets.

""...Thats odd"" he muttered, brows furrowing ""Wasn't supposed to be cloudy."" he leaned closer to the glass. The moon was gone. Just flat suffocating darkness. Squinting across the road, there was a shape – veiled in shadow and barely visible, standing unnaturally still.

Gene walked away with a grimace. ""Fuckin weirdos in this city.""

The radio crackled again ""Tonight's story takes place in a little cafe' in the middle of nowhere. It's the tale of a man that worked there tirelessly. Wasn't his dream job – hell no - but we all got to make bread in this cold harsh world, right listeners?""

Gene's ears perked. He turned toward the radio, eyes narrowing.

""It was his closing shift of the night, and he was not too happy about it, he felt dread working at that place. Damp and shabby, you know that kind of place, where dead ends hang around, sipping coffee that they can't afford. junkies. Heck, even ghosts probably.""

A cold finger ran down Gene's spine. He stepped closer to the counter, listening.

""The man was finishing up the usual chores. Sweeping floors, locking doors. Thinking he was safe inside. But you all know, danger knocks at no door. Not in this city. And that night? Out of all of us, That man was in the most danger."" Gene stepped back feeling unease at those words.

""The man was going back to his locker to change from his uniform and pick his belongings. And then – he heard it. A chime. Soft. Close. Familiar.""

Gene shook his head listening to the story. And yet he could not hide the uncanny feeling that was lurking in him. He reached again, turning the dial to change frequency. Twisting and turning, there was only static, occasionally interrupted by the radio voice.

""--Not much time left now friends. Tick, tock.""

""Fuck this piece of junk."" Gene turned off the radio and went back to work. The silence that followed was almost worse. He went to the staff area in the back and reached for his locker. He changed his clothes, stuffed his wallet and house keys into his pockets.

A chime rang.

Gene turned, scanning the main hall of the cafe', cold sweat coating his forehead. Taking a deep breath, he let out a nervous laugh. ""It's just a scary story on the radio."" said to calm himself, unable to not notice the coincidences from the radio host.

He walked back to the hall. Cold air coming from the ajar front door. He approached the door handle to get out of there and call it a night but when he tried to take the first step outside, he could not bring himself to. An unnatural, visceral fear grasped his mind as he gazed at the darkness outside, not even pierced by the sickly yellow lights of the cafe'.

It was a choice no man could face.

The horrors outside, or the dangers within?

Gene stepped back inside, locking the door behind him, the chimes tingling above. In the following silence he sighed, senses heightened.

He heard it again. The ticking of the clock.

Twelve.

He kept looking, the seconds ticking by completing full circle.

Twelve.

Another minute went by.

Twelve.

""What the fuck."" he muttered to himself as he walked away from the door towards the counter, his heels screeching on the linoleum.

The radio, he needed to turn on the radio. Switching it on again the husky voice came back.

"" --ed back on the radio, thinking that it could give him the answers to the many riddles happening to him. Why did the door open? How come the clock wasn't striking any other time? What was the darkness outside? We may get to those later listeners, no spoilers.""

Gene clutched the radio between his hands like it could somehow protect him. Answer to the impossibilities happening around him.

""Now now"" the voice crooned ""No need to panic listeners. It's just a story remember? A spooky story for sleepless nights. Strange nights. Wrong Nights.""

The lights above flickered.

""Just tell me what the fuck is going on!"" Hands shaking, Gene pulled the radio as it was speaking directly to the broadcaster. After a hiss the show continued.

""The man held the radio as if it was his lifeline"" a hint of amusement behind the words. ""but alas, even lifelines fray, don't they listeners?"" the broadcaster snickered.

In a fit of rage, Gene ripped the radio from the power outlet, raised it above his head, and then smashed it to the ground. ""Fuck you!"" He yelled, as the old radio shattered to pieces of circuitry and wood chips.

The voice stopped abruptly, and silence fell once more.

Gene's breath was heavy and uneven, looking down at the broken machine, staring at the speaker with an enraged frown.

The Clock struck twelve once more.

Gene sat down, elbows on the counter, hands covering his face.

""Now Now, Gene..."" deep, husky, threatening, the voice came from the speaker. ""...I was telling a story to our listeners, that was not very nice of you. We were just getting to the finale.""

Gene stared at the fragments, then rose stiffly. Hand to the wall, steadying himself, as if it could anchor him to reality.

""He thought he was safe inside,"" The broadcast continued between broken hisses of static. ""But doors, dear listeners... they don't really keep things out. Not when they are already inside.""

The chimes above the front door jingled once more.

Gene's head whipped toward the entrance. It was still closed. He walked slowly towards it. His hand was beaded in cold sweats as he approached the handle and with a trembling pull, he tried to open it. Still locked. He sighed in relief. Chimes rang once more and this time - it came from behind him.

""The man felt safe in the relative comfort of the illuminated cafe"" The voice said with a soft chuckle. ""And yet, he forgot - bright lights cast the darkest shadows. Let's dim down the lights now, listeners. The show is almost to an end.""

Gene turned. There it stood under the flickering lights - a dark cloaked figure of impossibly long limbs, towering over him. It's face, if it even had one, was nothing but a smear, an imitation of human forms. And as the lights flickered it moved, slowly, inexorably.

Gene scrambled through his pockets keys jingling between his trembling hands.

The ring felt impossibly heavy between is fingers - as if an invisible force was trying to snatch it away from him.

He scratched the keyhole with unsteady marks.

One key. No.

Two keys. No.

A third -- And then he felt it behind him.

Breathless. Silent. Waiting.

Gene muttered prayers as the being lowered his uneven hand on his shoulder, slowly turning him - as if to savor the moment.

A muffled scream followed, swallowed by the darkness of a moonless night.

""Finality"" the voice drawled, ""Is something we all fear, listeners. But when it comes – by choice or otherwise – no power in this world can stop it.""

The clock struck twelve.

""You have listened to 140.8 FM. Good night, my dear listener. I do hope you tune in for the next broadcast.""",1,1746786172.0,writers,1,1.0,False

As water is spurting when pouring a shot and going into my coffee, it cost me about $200 to have the service done and could possibly cost a hundred or more to get the issue fixed. I have ordered a replacement seal and will try and fix it myself, if that doesn’t work would I be better off buying a bambino new which is just over $300?",1,1746786165.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False
