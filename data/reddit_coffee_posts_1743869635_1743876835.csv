35 male from San Jose, Seperated looking to start dating again. Have kids, but not full time. Looking for a normal mature woman for a little physical and emotional connection. I tend to connect better with older women so prefer 40-50. 

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often. I’m weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don’t have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine. I am a sucker for super pretty faces. Any height is fine including taller.

I’m a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I’m a man’s man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it’s cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 

I’m  also not a big drinker and don’t need alcohol to have fun. I’d rather be fully present with someone I care deeply about. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there’s a connection, meet for coffee. 

Let me know more about you!

Since there was a little bit of it left to fill my 40+oz water bottle, I used the rest of it. She(24F) call her E then tries to fill up her cup with water, apparently she did t realize it was empty by holding it, but i told her it’s empty. She sucks her teeth out of frustration and makes a look at me. She puts it down says im not filling it up bring petty, so I go fill it up like I usually do when i empty because some people dont do it and then complain after that ppl should fill it after using *ahem* her. As im doing these she is complaining that she cant make her coffee because there is no water and my other sister her twin actually (24F) call her T, asks what time do you need to leave? (ps i dont drive so both my sisters were going to take me). I tell her like now and put the jug away. Anyways, when i turn around I dont see my phone anymore. I’m thinking I just had it while eating, and had seen it as i grabbed the empty jug to fill, now its not there. In my mornjng work routine I have to make sure I have everything before i brush my teeth and say put loud “wait where’s my phone? it was just here” She just makes a look at me glancing eyes, and truns her head right away as she tried to leave to the car already not saying anything but said goodbye to my mom. I look around and ask my mom to call while i search around the room and living room. then behold! my sister E picks ups and im just confused by it and my mom is too. Obviously I got irritated because in my eyes she so obviously took my phone to annoy me and because she likes to get reactions out of me for her own enjoyment, not the first time something petty like this happens by E. I go to brush my teeth and head to the car saying where was it. she said “it was in my bag, idk who put it there” Like girl dont act dumb. My other sister T, was on the other side of the table not around her bag, so was my nephew he was too busy eating and on his tablet to rly care about my phone much less put it in a bag. I start to go off and say “Right” in a “i know you lying way”. Usually she is more defensive when she truly feels “wronged” but she was just quiet. I go on, “you made me run late becahse of this stupid shit” then she starts getting defensive saying “its not my fault and you didnt come over here right when my mom told you it was here, what were you doing?” LIKE LITERALLY LOOKING FOR MY FUCKING PHONE DUDE SHE CALLED THE PHONE AND SHE PICKED UP HELLA LATE TOO LIKE AND I WAS BRUSHING MY TEETH YOU ANNOYING SNAKE. sorry yall it just irks me to think she was intentional on taking my phone when im getting ready to leave for work & dealing with problems people made for me yk biggest pet peeve. i end it with the fuck is wrong with you qnd then silence from her.

1js9evp,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestationvalley/comments/1js9evp/different_way_to_manifest_money/,Different way to Manifest Money,"Manifestation has increased in popularity by leaps and bounds, but what exactly is it, and how can you use it to call in more financial abundance?  
Here, we're unpacking what people get wrong about manifesting money, plus how you can actually do it.

**What manifestation really is.**  
Manifestation is the act of becoming aware of something that is already there. It's personal growth and development combined with spirituality, and it can help you achieve your financial dreams. By connecting spirit, mind, and body as one, you can manifest the experience you desire today, including monetarily.  
When people ask me how to manifest, I always say it's not about the how, it's more about the who—who you are. It has more to do with how you see yourself, how you see others, and how you perceive and interact with your world. If you want a different life, then you need to think, feel, and behave differently. Want real life manifestation practices then[ ManifestationRealRule](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestaionREALRule/)

  
Manifestation is always at work—we're always bringing something into the physical form through our thoughts. But most people are actually just manifesting their biggest fears (i.e., their worries about their business not growing and their need for more money), which creates more need for more money.  
And when it comes to specific ways to manifest money, unfortunately, there isn't a magic wand or specific phrase that will bring an abundance of money to you. However, it is pretty simple: Manifesting money happens within you.  
While manifestation has become a trendy topic thanks to social media, I believe some areas of manifestation are often misleading and misunderstood. For example, a specific color or mantra doesn't exactly attract money; rather, it comes down to our feelings around manifesting money and taking the proper steps to bring manifestation into your life.

**Different ways to manifest money:**

**1. Understand the laws of attraction and vibration.**  
Money is a response to a vibration that you are holding. It's the ""vibration"" of abundance and prosperity that literally attracts in more abundance and prosperity. The best way to manifest money is to feel as if you have it already. You can feel like you have money even if it's $10—it's the act of having gratitude for abundance and prosperity.  
Check out these guides to the law of attraction and the law of vibration for more information.

**2. Get specific.**  
Another key thing to understand for manifesting money is that it comes where it is needed. Don't just ask for more money—ask for what the money will be used for. For example, you may want to purchase a car, go on more vacations, pay off school loans, etc.

**3. Get comfortable with the feeling of spending.**  
Most people have buyer's remorse. They spend money on something they want and feel bad about it almost immediately after. This feeling comes from lack and limitation and feeling like, ""I do not have enough money, so when I spend, it feels gross.""  
What I'm suggesting is that you spend the same amount of money you do now but feel very different when you do. Instead of feeling like you don't have enough, feel like you *have* the money. Be grateful and thankful and truly enjoy your purchase. This puts you on the frequency of abundance.

**4. Try the 369 method.**  
The 369 method involves writing down what you would like to manifest three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon, and nine times at night. The purpose of this method is to reprogram the subconscious mind with focused attention and repetition. It allows someone to enter into the feeling of whatever it is you're writing.  
However, if you don't change how you see and think about money, and just write a financial amount out over and over again, this likely won't work—which will lead to frustration. The key is to change how you think and behave around money, but this method is helpful for initial shifts in your focus and for goal setting.

**5. Put yourself in abundant environments.**  
While you might not have millions of dollars in the bank right now, you can put yourself in environments where that kind of money is present. For example, go walk around the most expensive neighborhood in your town, follow accounts of wealthy people, and peruse high-end stores.  
And sometimes little changes can be powerful too. Instead of buying cheap coffee, spend a little more and elevate your coffee, or skip the plastic water bottle and drink water out of a crystal glass. There are so many ways to operate on a frequency of wealth without needing any money. What happens is you are putting your focus on abundance and you're seeing all the abundance available—that's what is going to help the most.

**6. Keep money in your wallet or write yourself a check.**  
Put a $100 bill in your wallet and leave it there if you can. Every time you open up your wallet and see the money in there, it will make you feel rich. It's also a reminder that there is always more money available to you. You could even write yourself a check with your name on it for a certain amount of money too.

**7. Try pairing crystals with your intention.**  
Crystals alone will not help you manifest money; they can only amplify the feeling that you're already in. For example, clear quartz is an amplifier, so if you have the mindset, ""I need money, I'm so poor,"" and you pick up the crystal, all you're doing is amplifying that mindset. You need to get yourself operating on a plane of abundance and prosperity, then the crystal will amplify that.

**8. Use affirmations.**  
Affirmations can be tricky. If you use one for too long, then you end up affirming a lack of true belief. For example, the more you have to say ""Money comes to me continuously and easily,"" the more you may not actually accept the affirmation to be true. Your mind could even follow up with ""No, it doesn't."" The key is to have faith in the new belief, believe it, and let it go. What if it was really true?

**9. Visualize, visualize, visualize.**  
Visualizations are a very important tactic when it comes to manifesting. Visualize money in your bank account, your salary increasing, or telling your kids about the trip you just booked for them. And for what it's worth, the best times to visualize are first thing in the morning and before bed.  
Vision boards can also be helpful here. However, make sure to ask yourself, ""Who do I need to be to manifest this vision board?"" You're creating a new lifestyle for yourself on the vision board, but the internal work still needs to be done. The personal growth and development that is required to become who you want to be in order to manifest is the real work.

**A note on getting started.**  
You might be asking yourself, where do I even start? And to that end, the first step is self-awareness. Try to understand who you are and get to know yourself. What are the thought patterns that hold you back? You have to look within yourself to become the best version of you.  
Be the most inspired, empowered, and grateful version of yourself. If you are constantly living with negative thoughts and have a scarcity mindset, you have to let that go in order to make room for abundance.  
Make sure you're spiritually connected and aligned: Meditation, visualization, reading, studying, and believing in something greater than yourself are all ways to become spiritually centered.

The next step is to go into the intellectual mind and create a new idea. As it relates to money, the new idea is prosperity and abundance. You're going to reprogram all the beliefs you have about money using the intellectual mind. That's manifestation!  
If you think money is hard to make, then it will remain hard. But if you shift your belief to it being easier or effortless, then you will start to experience that in your world. Even shifting your perspective to all the times it has come easily would be helpful.  
Lastly, it's important to move differently when it comes to money. How can you feel differently with it, spend in a new way, and use money—not let it use you?

**The takeaway.**  
Manifestation is becoming aware of a version of yourself you perhaps never thought was there. This shift in identity then changes what you bring into your life—and you can manifest anything, including better relationships, a change in your business, self-love, health, and so much more. All of these tools and techniques can be applied to anything you want to manifest.  
The biggest takeaway here is that you must put in the time to get to know yourself and change your thinking. There is no luck, but there is intention. Your personal transformation awaits!",1,1743875988.0,manifestationvalley,0,1.0,False

The husband has a job in the same field as my husband and the wife and I have a couple of similar interests. They introduced us to their larger friend group and we’ve gotten close with another couple who happen to be godparents to their children and also live close by.

My husband and I have slowly started to find this first couple exhausting and we don’t know how to end this friendship with them. We tried slowly backing away but they are very persistent about scheduling a hang with us. I don’t want to end this friendship over text message but I’m not sure trying to schedule a coffee date with the wife and I is the right move either… I was hoping I would run into them at the local coffee shop and I could spontaneously tell them how we feel but that has yet to happen.

Ok so here are our issues. The husband is a dick…he just is. He’s pretty funny and often makes jokes at the expense of others but he’s the kind of person that is very insecure and puts other people down to make himself feel better. We don’t mind most of the time when he’s making fun of us if it seems in good fun and we’re all taking the piss out of each other but often it feels malicious. He’s said some rude ass shit that’s in no way funny to both of us at different times and each time I’ve been really speechless because the only thing I can think to say back is something equally mean and that’s not me. His wife multiple times has brought up in front of all of us that her husband has lost friends because he’s a “bully” and some people can’t handle it. She’s definitely said this to smooth things over after he’s been extra rude.

Secondly, these people want to hang out with us ALL of the time. They’ve organized a weekly hang with us and the other couple that we like. We have a lot of friends that we love and have been close with a long time and I only see those people one or two times a month, a weekly hang with people you don’t love is too much. I don’t think this would have escalated to the point of us not wanting them in our lives at all if we only saw them once a month or less. Every time I’ve tried to get out of this weekly hang they offer to move the date for us and I’m like “please no stop just leave me alone.” On top of this my husband and I have been dealing with some pretty gnarly medical issues the past two years and I just don’t want to be around people I don’t feel comfortable with and I don’t want to have to explain that to them every week.

Lastly, they’re RFK Jr kinda people which means they’re MAGA light at this point. I can be friends with people with differing political beliefs but hanging out with a Joe Rogan/Jordan Peterson bro is just so annoying. He’s constantly confidently spreading misinformation and they’re definitely anti-vaxxers. I’m honestly just exhausted thinking about it and I have no idea why they want to be friends with us so badly.

That brings us to now. We started hanging a small amount on the side alone with the couple we like but, again, they’re very close with the other couple we can’t stand. I don’t want to put them in the middle of this and we haven’t brought it up to them but it’s pretty clear we’re not very responsive on the group chat for scheduling the next hang. The group chat has been very quiet the last month so we thought maybe they understood we were very upset the last time we hung out but this week the wife has texted multiple times trying to schedule a game night with all of us. Last night she even hit me on the side directly and I was nice but short with her. I don’t want to be a dick. I don’t want to be fake. I don’t want to do it over text message. We have so many regrets of not saying enough in the moment we were upset but we can’t change that now.

1js9dp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestaionREALRule/comments/1js9dp7/different_ways_to_manifest_money/,Different ways to Manifest Money,"Manifestation has increased in popularity by leaps and bounds, but what exactly is it, and how can you use it to call in more financial abundance?  
Here, we're unpacking what people get wrong about manifesting money, plus how you can actually do it.

**What manifestation really is.**  
Manifestation is the act of becoming aware of something that is already there. It's personal growth and development combined with spirituality, and it can help you achieve your financial dreams. By connecting spirit, mind, and body as one, you can manifest the experience you desire today, including monetarily.  
When people ask me how to manifest, I always say it's not about the how, it's more about the who—who you are. It has more to do with how you see yourself, how you see others, and how you perceive and interact with your world. If you want a different life, then you need to think, feel, and behave differently. Want real life manifestation practices then[ ManifestationRealRule](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestaionREALRule/)

  
Manifestation is always at work—we're always bringing something into the physical form through our thoughts. But most people are actually just manifesting their biggest fears (i.e., their worries about their business not growing and their need for more money), which creates more need for more money.  
And when it comes to specific ways to manifest money, unfortunately, there isn't a magic wand or specific phrase that will bring an abundance of money to you. However, it is pretty simple: Manifesting money happens within you.  
While manifestation has become a trendy topic thanks to social media, I believe some areas of manifestation are often misleading and misunderstood. For example, a specific color or mantra doesn't exactly attract money; rather, it comes down to our feelings around manifesting money and taking the proper steps to bring manifestation into your life.

**Different ways to manifest money:**

**1. Understand the laws of attraction and vibration.**  
Money is a response to a vibration that you are holding. It's the ""vibration"" of abundance and prosperity that literally attracts in more abundance and prosperity. The best way to manifest money is to feel as if you have it already. You can feel like you have money even if it's $10—it's the act of having gratitude for abundance and prosperity.  
Check out these guides to the law of attraction and the law of vibration for more information.

**2. Get specific.**  
Another key thing to understand for manifesting money is that it comes where it is needed. Don't just ask for more money—ask for what the money will be used for. For example, you may want to purchase a car, go on more vacations, pay off school loans, etc.

**3. Get comfortable with the feeling of spending.**  
Most people have buyer's remorse. They spend money on something they want and feel bad about it almost immediately after. This feeling comes from lack and limitation and feeling like, ""I do not have enough money, so when I spend, it feels gross.""  
What I'm suggesting is that you spend the same amount of money you do now but feel very different when you do. Instead of feeling like you don't have enough, feel like you *have* the money. Be grateful and thankful and truly enjoy your purchase. This puts you on the frequency of abundance.

**4. Try the 369 method.**  
The 369 method involves writing down what you would like to manifest three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon, and nine times at night. The purpose of this method is to reprogram the subconscious mind with focused attention and repetition. It allows someone to enter into the feeling of whatever it is you're writing.  
However, if you don't change how you see and think about money, and just write a financial amount out over and over again, this likely won't work—which will lead to frustration. The key is to change how you think and behave around money, but this method is helpful for initial shifts in your focus and for goal setting.

**5. Put yourself in abundant environments.**  
While you might not have millions of dollars in the bank right now, you can put yourself in environments where that kind of money is present. For example, go walk around the most expensive neighborhood in your town, follow accounts of wealthy people, and peruse high-end stores.  
And sometimes little changes can be powerful too. Instead of buying cheap coffee, spend a little more and elevate your coffee, or skip the plastic water bottle and drink water out of a crystal glass. There are so many ways to operate on a frequency of wealth without needing any money. What happens is you are putting your focus on abundance and you're seeing all the abundance available—that's what is going to help the most.

**6. Keep money in your wallet or write yourself a check.**  
Put a $100 bill in your wallet and leave it there if you can. Every time you open up your wallet and see the money in there, it will make you feel rich. It's also a reminder that there is always more money available to you. You could even write yourself a check with your name on it for a certain amount of money too.

**7. Try pairing crystals with your intention.**  
Crystals alone will not help you manifest money; they can only amplify the feeling that you're already in. For example, clear quartz is an amplifier, so if you have the mindset, ""I need money, I'm so poor,"" and you pick up the crystal, all you're doing is amplifying that mindset. You need to get yourself operating on a plane of abundance and prosperity, then the crystal will amplify that.

**8. Use affirmations.**  
Affirmations can be tricky. If you use one for too long, then you end up affirming a lack of true belief. For example, the more you have to say ""Money comes to me continuously and easily,"" the more you may not actually accept the affirmation to be true. Your mind could even follow up with ""No, it doesn't."" The key is to have faith in the new belief, believe it, and let it go. What if it was really true?

**9. Visualize, visualize, visualize.**  
Visualizations are a very important tactic when it comes to manifesting. Visualize money in your bank account, your salary increasing, or telling your kids about the trip you just booked for them. And for what it's worth, the best times to visualize are first thing in the morning and before bed.  
Vision boards can also be helpful here. However, make sure to ask yourself, ""Who do I need to be to manifest this vision board?"" You're creating a new lifestyle for yourself on the vision board, but the internal work still needs to be done. The personal growth and development that is required to become who you want to be in order to manifest is the real work.

**A note on getting started.**  
You might be asking yourself, where do I even start? And to that end, the first step is self-awareness. Try to understand who you are and get to know yourself. What are the thought patterns that hold you back? You have to look within yourself to become the best version of you.  
Be the most inspired, empowered, and grateful version of yourself. If you are constantly living with negative thoughts and have a scarcity mindset, you have to let that go in order to make room for abundance.  
Make sure you're spiritually connected and aligned: Meditation, visualization, reading, studying, and believing in something greater than yourself are all ways to become spiritually centered.

The next step is to go into the intellectual mind and create a new idea. As it relates to money, the new idea is prosperity and abundance. You're going to reprogram all the beliefs you have about money using the intellectual mind. That's manifestation!  
If you think money is hard to make, then it will remain hard. But if you shift your belief to it being easier or effortless, then you will start to experience that in your world. Even shifting your perspective to all the times it has come easily would be helpful.  
Lastly, it's important to move differently when it comes to money. How can you feel differently with it, spend in a new way, and use money—not let it use you?

**The takeaway.**  
Manifestation is becoming aware of a version of yourself you perhaps never thought was there. This shift in identity then changes what you bring into your life—and you can manifest anything, including better relationships, a change in your business, self-love, health, and so much more. All of these tools and techniques can be applied to anything you want to manifest.  
The biggest takeaway here is that you must put in the time to get to know yourself and change your thinking. There is no luck, but there is intention. Your personal transformation awaits!",1,1743875903.0,ManifestaionREALRule,0,1.0,False

I don’t see many people have this much redness on the day to day . I wondered if my autism makes me more susceptible to inflammation as we tend to be quite sensitive to a lot of things like food, medication & just environmental stuff like noises or heat ?
I take a lot of vitamins in hopes to keep at least some inflammation at bay : 
Fish oil 
Chelated Zinc 
Probiotics  
To name a few . 
I found the best solution to keeping the redness at bay is to have a very strict diet but obviously -I don’t do that anymore because diary & coffee is delicious & it felt too restrictive to live a full life . 
I wear suncream daily too but the redness is just always there no matter what & I get these spots usually on my chin & nose . It’s very frustrating.

DURING LONG FLIGHT WITH RUNNY NOSE 
( POSSIBLY CAUSED BY COMMON COLD,DUST, that's all.)
GIGANTIC PAIN BEHIND EYE BALL . I do not swear to mum . I said 'oh my eye hurts wait no what the fuck it hurts what the fuck ' or something like that. Sister put cold compress ( wet wipes from miniso ) onto my eye,said she's had it before and to grip my thumb with hand and do stuipid breathing exercises which I hate more than a lot of things that I dislike. And drinking water, big gulps etc. Made absolutely no difference was panicking a lot. Started crying but only with eyes not gasping or anything. Hurt for about one day after? I am bad with time sorry as of late I have become insanely forgetful like not even ADHD SO forgetful I am beginning to worry. Like a lot. Okkk feeling overwhelmed. Anyway, what the fuck I just forgot istbahppeninh now holy balls. Ok I'm remembering one sec. wait. Yeah so it hurt for a day after, around 3 hours after getting off terrible flight with great food I landed in bag getting area idk what it's called I got my cute suitcase from 'guess' and went in crowded bumpy ass taxi with my cute suitcasen slipping out of car boot having to hold it up with my big ass triangular ( right angle ) head. Hurt very much, deadass thought neck would break , neck hurt , head hurt.  Just mentioning that incase of whatever . OMFG I forgot again. Wait. Thanks. I got off of that and was so overstimulated I fucking hated that, as I was home well not home but as I was at house I took two shit tasting Calpol tablets and pain slightly subsided after I don't know how long like two hours idk I'm not the time keeper. I honestly don't think they did anything but I think that was just the pain like leaving but ( please keep reading I love you) I woke up and pain was preeeeeeeettty much gone again idk I really really don't know the times of anything. PLACES THAT HURTED ( sorry 'hurt' is easily misunderstandable in that) my eyebrow like pretty deep pain but obviously in that part like the ridge above eye socket ew yucky ass word swiftly moving on and my eyeballs the whole thing and a thumb sized radius of that area when touched in any way but not necessarily by itself. 

things to keep in mind while diagnosing me 💔💔
ON TWO HOUR ✈️ 
HAD FOUR COFFEES WITHIN A TWO DAY SPAN . they were absolutely miniscule like maybe an average mug cut in half taking the bottom half and filling it up
HAD RUNNY NOSE, AM IN INDIA (DUSTY ROADS AS IN DRY DIRT)
SUPER HIGH UP PLANE
INDIGO FUCKING AIRLINES 
EXTREME TURBULENCE.
 if anyone was on that flight heyyyy!
I usually loooovee turbulence because hey I've always lived through it but I fucking hated that. It's usually like fun roller coaster with no danger but my goodness  felt like absolute semi dry cement.
Also after flight went to taxi where my suitcase was bumping my head and has to hold it up while going DOWNHILL HUGE HILL. Suitcase is hard and heavy , really cute from 'guess'. That was absolutely ages , also dusty road. Felt bad asking taxi to pull over, plus big family was in taxi and I didn't want me moving the the passenger seat and just hearing their necks break so I used my super strong powers. Also one of my eyes has always been more buggy than one but recently it's been seeming little more big, when I smile to create aeyegosal under eye( only way I know how to describe that appearance 😭) one is a lot fuller than other. 
Just want to mention that my oral health is bad. I chipped my tooth eating a Gummy. A SLIGHTLY CHEWY GUMMY.
I brush regularly and well, these problems started ages ago and I have neglected them. 
Pretty sure I've got gingivitis but there are more important diagnosises I need.
I am suicidal very often and have extreme mood swings and neglecting health is a pretty ok death. Like not rlly obviously ok. Moving on 👻
Pain began to reach peak in about ten seconds was swearing whole time.
I don't want to say this incase I predict it but left eyebrow area is having slow sharp but tense teeny pains every pain few mins apart. 

POSSIBLE DIAGNOSES
Fuck all forbid it's a tumour
Sinus infection??? Even though I'm literally fine rn no runny nose.
Altitude pressure 
Early Parkinson's
I don't know I'm sorry
I don't want to say I'm psychic but low-key 👻
I have been really deadass thinking of tumours recently and now I get this shittily timed obscenity in my head? Fuck off 
I'm sorry for swearing I am panicking and it is substitute to using Gods name in vain ( yes yes swearing is bad.)

Will cry if it's a tumour I will wade through spider soup before a doctor touches my fucking eyeballs. I am so squeamish it's insane. I think that's all there is to say, hope someone can understand that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Finding honest remote jobs online with flexible schedules can be a game-changer for many people. Whether you are a parent, student, or just someone who values work-life balance, the opportunities available in this realm are both appealing and practical.

One of the greatest benefits is the flexibility that comes with remote jobs. When you work from home or any location of your choice, you have the freedom to design your own schedule. This is particularly helpful if you have other commitments, such as caring for family members or pursuing personal projects. You can choose to work early in the morning or later in the day, allowing you to manage your time effectively.

Moreover, remote jobs often lead to reduced commuting time. You save not only on transportation costs but also on the time spent stuck in traffic or waiting for public transport. This means you can use those extra hours for your hobbies, family time, or simply relaxation. Many remote workers find this aspect to be a significant improvement in their quality of life.

Another advantage of honest remote jobs online is the ability to choose an environment that suits you best. Some people thrive in a bustling office, while others may prefer the quiet of their home office or a coffee shop. When you have the freedom to work where you feel most productive, it enhances your creativity and efficiency. You can optimize your workspace, ensuring it fits your personal style and working habits.

Remote jobs also widen the scope for job opportunities. You are not restricted by geographic location, meaning you can apply for positions that may not be available in your local area. This opens up a global market for employment, allowing you to select jobs that not only match your skill set but also align with your values and interests. For instance, you could work with companies that promote sustainability or diversity while finding a position that truly resonates with you.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Here are some additional advantages of engaging in remote jobs with flexible schedules:

- **Improved Work-Life Balance:** Flexible hours allow you to handle personal responsibilities without compromising professional duties.
- **Increased Productivity:** Many remote workers report being more productive at home, where they can create their ideal work environment.
- **Health Benefits:** Reduced stress levels from commuting and the ability to take breaks when needed can lead to improved mental health and well-being.
- **Financial Savings:** Working remotely can save you money on gas, meals, and even work attire, giving you more financial freedom.

In addition to flexibility, you should look for trustworthy online job platforms that focus on honest remote jobs. Websites like FlexJobs, Remote.co, and We Work Remotely have curated lists of remote positions that offer genuine employment opportunities. Remember to conduct thorough research on companies to avoid scams, as the remote job market can attract dishonest players.

Networking can also play an important role in finding these jobs. Engaging in online communities or professional networks dedicated to remote work can provide you with leads on job openings.

How to Find Genuine Remote Work Opportunities That Fit Your Lifestyle
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding genuine remote work opportunities that fit your lifestyle can feel overwhelming. With a variety of online job boards, websites, and platforms promising easy access to flexible jobs, it’s important to sift through the noise. The right remote job can lead to enhanced work-life balance, allowing you to enjoy more time with family, travel, or even pursue personal projects. Here’s how you can navigate the search effectively.

### Identify Your Skills and Interests

Before you start looking for remote jobs, take some time to reflect on what you can offer. Consider your current job skills, hobbies, and passions. Make a list that includes:

- Technical skills (e.g., coding, graphic design, digital marketing)
- Soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork, problem-solving)
- Industry experience (e.g., education, healthcare, finance)

This inventory will help you focus your search on jobs that match your capabilities, making you a more appealing candidate.

### Utilize Reputable Job Platforms

Now that you know what you're looking for, it’s time to explore the world of online job platforms. Not every site is trustworthy, so it’s critical to choose reputable sources. Consider the following:

By using these platforms, you can find listings that genuinely offer remote work with flexible schedules.

### Network with Remote Workers

Connecting with others who work remotely can provide insights into finding genuine opportunities. Join online communities, social media groups, or forums where remote workers gather. Platforms like:

- Experience with remote tools (e.g., Slack, Zoom, Trello)
- Examples of successful projects you've completed remotely
- Highlight your time management and self-discipline

A tailored resume addresses the requirements of the job listing and shows employers that you understand what remote work entails.

### Prepare for Remote Interviews

- Practice your answers to common behavioral interview questions.
- Be ready to explain your usual work setup and how you stay organized.
- Demonstrate knowledge about the company and its remote work culture.

Showing that you are prepared and knowledgeable can make you stand out as a candidate.

### Evaluate Job Listings Carefully

Not all remote job listings are created equal. Ensure that you find positions that genuinely offer the flexibility you need. Look for clues in the job description, such as:

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
- Specific mentions of ""flexible hours"" or ""work/life balance”
- Requirements related to time zone, which can indicate flexibility
- Company culture information, often found on their website

Being diligent during this stage will save you time and energy in the long run.

By following these strategies, you can improve your chances of finding genuine remote jobs that align with your lifestyle. With determination and the right approach, you can achieve a more fulfilling and balanced work experience.

### Conclusion

Finding honest remote jobs online with flexible schedules can significantly enhance your work-life balance. These opportunities not only allow you to tailor your working hours but also grant you the freedom to work from any location, which is a game changer for many. The benefits are clear: more time with family, less commuting stress, and the ability to pursue personal passions alongside professional responsibilities.

The stage is used for live bands, but we will be having a DJ and there is already a separate area for them to set up to the left of the stage.  Our venue explained that some people rent furniture but paying $1500 for a few couches to be dropped off seems a bit silly. 

Theme is a mix of boho and botanical, dried florals add live houseplants, surrounded by cream brick and lots of natural lighting. Colored glass with copper and gold accents on each table. Think cool coffee shop vibe, but make it a wedding. 

We will have a photo booth that could be placed up there but idk how “cute” it will look. There will hopefully be a temporary tattoo stations as well.

I'm ok with that, ik it's going to be hard but ik I can do it. My question is tho, when do/can you start bringing back in the ""yummy"" foods? Not going to lie, I love pasta, bread, sweets, and especially chocolate. I'm a big coffee lover as well. I currently don't consume that stuff a lot but there are times where I'd like to have a taste every now and then. 

When they say to ""stay away"" from those types of foods is it because of potential health complications or is it just to avoid gaining weight again? I read starches could cause blockage early on but after a year or more can I eat pasta again? Can I drink coffee or have a bit of chocolate ever again? Not in an overindulgence way but it definitely would suck if I have to swear it off forever.

Basically what I'm asking is how strict do you stick to the meal plan and when did you reintroduce back the ""bad foods""? Did it affect you at all or cause any complications? For those a year + post surgery, would you say you have a ""normal"" diet now?",1,1743875559.0,BariatricSurgery,3,0.99,False

1js97dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpalsover30/comments/1js97dq/34m_usa_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,"34M, USA - Longing for intense and deep connection and elaborate exchange","Salutations!

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and the occasional postcard, and I'd like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to also give that to someone else as well.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal* \- cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.

On that, *being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.* We're in a written realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, defeats the point of this, does it not?

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",1,1743875440.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.

On that, *being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.* We're in a written realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, defeats the point of this, does it not?

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",1,1743875427.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

On a sunny day, in a grassy field, there laid a man. As the sun rises on his glossy blond hair, pale white skin and beautiful blue eyes. Wearing a white mildly tattered white shirt and slightly damaged black pants. He wakes. As he takes in his surroundings, delirious and teary eyed from what seems to be a peaceful sleep, he thinks to himself:

""Who am I?"", ""Why am I here?"" and ""How did I get here?"".

His questions went unanswered as his gets himself together and stands up.

Observing his surroundings he sees a rural town with a big tower in the distance.

""Oh!"" he yelps, ""Maybe I can get some answers there!"". As he walks towards the town, he starts to ponder about himself.

""Why don't I remember anything? Maybe I hit my head a little too hard."" He says to himself. As he walks, He starts to think even further about how weird his situation is. ""Why am I not hungry? I just woke up and don't seem to be sleepy so I must have slept for long, right? Shouldn't I be at the very least a bit hungry?"" He thinks to himself.

As he nears the edge of town, he sees people coming out of their homes, getting ready for their morning routines, some take a morning stroll while others exercise in a morning jog, and even some who just wants to enjoy the morning air with a cup of coffee.

The lost man approaches a person enjoying a cup of coffee, the latter, spotting the lost man stares the him in the face for a good few second and suddenly says in a cheery tone: ""Greetings Sir, can I help you?"" The lost man, slightly confused says: ""Hi there, Could you please tell me which town I am in?"" The man, in a slightly confused tone says: ""Well, you are in Amniea, the town of innovation of course?"" The lost man, confused says: ""I see... so, what is that big tower?""

The man, even more confused says: ""Well, that is the Spire of Arlo, where innovation comes to fruition..? If you want to know more you can always go inside."" So the lost man thanked the kind stranger and started to make his way to the big tower.

Along the way, he encounters some particular persons. The first being a man so engrossed in a book he stood in the middle of the pathway, reading. The lost man, confused calls out to the mysterious reader. ""Hi there, it seems you are blocking the pathway, could you please move?""

The mysterious reader angrily grunts: ""Do you mind? I am READING!"".

The lost man says: ""What are you reading that made you so engrossed in reading to the point you are standing in the middle of the pathway?"" The mysterious man say in an infuriated tone: ""You don't KNOW!? It's the Book of Arlo! The one who innovated innovation itself! He created everything you see around you! He-"" The mysterious and now obsessive reader continues to blabber on about Arlo and his achievements.

The lost man slips away as the reader keeps ranting.

The next peculiar person he encounters is an older woman, who appears to be around the age of 50 to 60. The lost man walks towards the her, unknowingly under the gaze of that woman. ""Good Morning young man!"" The woman hollers.

The lost man jolted at the woman's remark, ""AH! Ah. You scared me!""

""Sorry Sir, I just wanted to say you look quite disheveled, are you alright?"" Said the older woman. ""Yes, I am alright"" Said the lost man. ""Just a little put off by some obsessed guy, he was ranting about someone named Arlo."" He added. The woman, with a disgusted face and appalled tone says ""ARLO?! That good for nothing sham created all this folly he calls 'Innovation', that good for nothing created unnecessary creations and-"" The woman rants about how annoyed and dissatisfied she is about Arlo's innovations. Once again, The lost man slips away while she ranted.

Nearing the center of the town, the last Peculiar person the Lost man encounters is an unkempt, dirty man who appears to be homeless as he is sitting on a piece of cardboard. With a raspy voice the homeless man said: ""Spare change?"" the Homeless man mutters. ""Sorry, but I am sorry to say I am just as penniless as you are."" Said the Lost man said. ""Ahh, sorry to bother you."" The Homeless man exclaimed. As the Lost man wonders what this guy going to be like, the Homeless man says: ""So where do you think you are headed?"" Confused, the Lost man says: ""I believe it is called the... Spire of Arlo..?"" The Homeless man says: ""That place is not what it seems. There is something going on in that building and I don't like it. If you are actually going to go in there, I wish you the best of luck.""

The Lost man, now even more confused and now a little nervous, the lost man thanks the Homeless man and wishes him the best of luck as well.

Approaching the building, He sees a set of sliding doors. As he approaches them, the open and after the Lost man entered is greeted from across the room with a very enthusiastic but stiff and practiced ""Greetings, Good Sir. Welcome to the Spire of Arlo, where innovation was innovated!"" Before the Lost man, was an emotionless, Plastic Doll faced woman with a red dress, a well mannered demeanor and a stiff unmoving stance. The Lost man asks the woman: ""Who might you be?"" The woman answered: ""My name is... unimportant, I shall be your Tour Guide in this tower, no need for payment, getting another member for the Followers of Arlo is payment enough!"" ""Tour Guide? what do you mean Tour Gui-"" The Lost man was cut off.

""Please save your questions until after the initiation."" The woman exclaimed with an unchanging face.

""But-""

""I said please save your questions.""

The woman rebuked.

After a short silence the woman continued. ""Please follow me for the tour, and No Touching.""

After that last chilling remark, he made sure to keep that in mind. Then they enter what seems to be an elevator and the woman pushes one of the two buttons in the elevator. After arriving on the floor after what seemed like minutes, the woman exits the elevator and then commences the Tour.

""This is the first machine that Sir Arlo created, it's main purpose in unknown as there was no mention of this in his Journal. All we know is that only Arlo is the only one who can use it, and our great and glorious innovator disappeared after he created his last machine.""

The two continued forward.

""This next piece of art is the-"" as the woman continues from machine to machine, the Lost man feels a sense of dread. Remembering a few choice words used by the woman: ""no need for payment, getting another member for the Followers of Arlo is payment enough!"" ""Is this a Cult?!""

He thought to himself. ""I need to get out of here, but how?"" As panic slowly builds he leans up against a wall while the woman is explaining another piece of Arlo's work and suddenly feels a slight give to the wall.

The Lost man thinks to himself: ""Huh, maybe it opens up?"" And so after waiting for the woman to fully turn around, as she was explaining almost obsessively a piece of Arlo's work, the Lost man takes the opportunity and pushes inward, the wall gives in and he stumbles backwards into a dusty old room filled with books and journals and a single desk and chair. The Lost man quickly closes the entrance back up while the woman was still explaining obsessively.

The lost man approaches the desk and sees a book and what looks like a reinforced lock keeping the contents of the book closed and out of reach.

On the lock there seems to be a pad instead of a key hole. ""This looks... familiar..."" the Lost man mutters. He puts his thumb up against the lock and it makes a humming sound and it suddenly opens up. Revealing the contents of this mysterious book to the Lost man. Once opened, a note fell out of the book and landed on the desk. The Lost man picked it up and read it. ""If you are reading this, that means you have acquired my personal journal. A journal that I have made sure to never be seen by the public eye. It also means my machine didn't take me far enough. Read the contents of this journal and follow it's instructions. Do not fail.""

The instruction in the journal was about the first machine Arlo created.

The instructions were as follows:

1.) Pull the second and forth lever on the right side of the machine.

2.) Press the first, third, ninth then second colored buttons on the panel below the lever.

3.) Wait until the on the left of the panel bar fills up.

4.) Press the buttons on the panel again but in the order of green, blue, cyan, orange, navy blue, red, green again, yellow, red, lime green, blue, orange.

5.) Finally, Pull the biggest lever and get in the chamber before it closes, you only have 10 second to do so.

Now, equipped with mysterious knowledge, the Lost man exits the the hidden room cautiously as to not alert the Tour Guide, The Lost man doesn't know if the Tour Guide will stop him or not, so as a precaution, he slowly progresses towards the machine he now knows as the ""Chronius"".

As the Lost man progress towards the Chronius, he gets spotted by the Tour Guide. ""HEY! Why did you leave the tour!? Get back here!"" Now panicked, the Lost man dashes away, and the Tour Guide following distantly behind. Dodging and weaving, the Lost man navigates through a more packed section of the quote on quote ""Museum"" to hopefully lose his trail. Finding a spot to rest, the Lost man catches his breath and tries to make sense of where he currently is. Finding the right path he trudges on, the fatigue from running so much pulling him down, finally feeling the hunger he thought was missing, and the only things keeping him going is the unease of this place and the desperation of maybe finding something about himself.

Suddenly, he hears a shout. ""I said get back here!"" The Tour Guide caught up. Startled by the shout, he tried to sprint but tripped and stumbled, dropping the journal. The Lost man ran without thinking, and when he realized he dropped the journal, he thought it was fine as he memorized the steps beforehand. Seeing the machine he bolted to the right side and Pulled the second and forth lever, He looked down to see the panel with colored buttons and pushed the first, third, ninth and then second buttons.

waiting for the bar to fill up he hears the Tour Guide in the distance, the Lost man impatiently waits for the bar to fill up panicking as he hears the voice of the Tour Guide getting closer and closer, once it filled up he pressed the buttons in order. Green, blue, cyan, orange, navy blue, red, green again, yellow... He for got... He forgot the next color, distraught, basically giving up, he falls to his knees in despair. Awaiting the Tour Guide.

The Tour Guide finally shows up. Accepting his failure he looks up to see the Tour Guide slowly approaching, exhausted from running. As he looked at his end, sure he will get some kind of punishment for touching the machine, he sees the color of her dress... red... With a massive realization, he leapt from the ground, pushing the red, lime green, blue and orange buttons, he pulled the largest lever with all his might and started to climb the machine to get into the chamber. 10-9-8 The Tour Guide started screaming at him with a furious tone to ""Get Off! You aren't allowed to climb there!"" 7-6-5 She clung to his shabby pants and he kicked her off, tearing and leaving a bit of his pants behind. 4-3-2 ""Thank goodness my pants were worn out"" He thought. Then he leapt into the chamber right as it closed. 1-0....

Suddenly, libraries of information flooded into his head. Every single creation in this museum and how to use it, every idea and thought written in those journals in that old room, every memory he had lost, he knew where had been, where his is, and where he was going, and most importantly, his name. His name, is Arlo.",2,1743875418.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Of course, war is a terrible thing. People killing each other over meaningless issues—I completely agree, war is a bad thing.  
But I think it’s something humanity needs, like a fever.  
When your body gets a fever, it’s not just suffering—it’s fighting. Fighting off bacteria or viruses. In the same way, war can be seen as a kind of fever for humanity.

Take World War II, for example. It was one of the worst times to live. There were no clear rules about what one person could do to another. It wasn’t just soldiers—civilians suffered horribly too.  
But after that, we got human rights, the Geneva Conventions. We created rules that even define how to fight an enemy. Torture only became illegal after WWII. Before that, there were no real rules.  
Or take the U.S. Civil War. Yes, people died—but afterwards, Black people gained their human rights.  
Same with the French Revolution. A lot of people died, but the outcome was democracy.

Now, I’m not saying every war is justified. But some are so destructive, so extreme, that they force us to change—and often, that change is for the better.

**What will WW3 might change?**

Look at the current state of the world. Most countries have democracy, yet their elected presidents can do whatever the hell they want for 5 to 10 years.  
I’m not a U.S. citizen, but as I understand it, for the last week, Trump has been in a position where he can do whatever he wants for the next 5 years. If he wants, he could start a war with Iran or even China.  
And by the way, those tariffs—aren’t they just taxes? Basically, he’s raising taxes, right?  
I’m not going to say he’s doing something right or wrong. Let’s focus on the subject.  
The main thing here is: Putin can do whatever he wants. Because people voted for him. They could prohibit people from drinking water every Monday if they wanted to—or coffee.  
Now you might say, “No, he can’t, because we have this system in place to prevent that—blah blah blah.”  
No. They can do whatever they want. Period.

I believe this system won’t change. I believe this thing called democracy is a problem for the world. I think it needs to change.  
My vote is equal to the vote of someone with no education, and someone with a high degree—and Elon Musk says, “This is what people want.”

* **Make your own cleaning stuff.** Mixing things like vinegar and water can be a cheap and healthy way to clean your house instead of buying expensive cleaners.

* **Know what your money goals are.** Have clear reasons why you want to save money. This ""why"" will help you stay motivated to make frugal choices.
* **Cook a lot of food at once.** Make big meals a few times a week so you have food for the rest of the week. This saves time and reduces food waste.

Everything feels cold. My heart feels cold. 

I don't like it. It doesn't feel good, it doesn't feel right. So I cried about it last night. A lot. 

Then I got upset with myself. Because I said I wouldn't cry, but I did. I've even cried today. 

I'm tired of hurting. 

I'm scared that this is all I am ever going to know. 

I'm scared.

I'm terrified of this life. 

All I wanted was love. 

I didn't want to give up. 

I didn't want to stop. 

I only wanted to love. 

I only wanted you. 

I stayed in last night, I fell asleep just a bit after 9. I slept solidly, only woke up once to pee, and didn't wake up fully until around 930. 12 hours. I don't recall even feeling that tired, but I definitely remember being incredibly sad. 

I thought that when you let go of something like this that things are supposed to hurt less, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I said goodbye to my hopes and my wants, I said goodbye to my dream of love … so why does it all still hurt so much? In reality I know he has been gone for so much longer, and all of this time that I've yearned - I guess letting go doesn't stop the burn? 

Why can't I just be happy?

When I woke up this morning I threw away my vape. And I flushed my cocaine. The novelty of both have already been erased. I had a 3 month triste with uppers and bad behavior, and while it was fun for a moment, it's time to close that chapter. It simply was something that I wanted to experience, and now I have. I only did blow about 10 times over the past 3 months, and honestly the after effects (constantly burning, dripping and/or completely blocked nose) really don't make it worthwhile imo. Plus it made the idea of sex really not great for me … I get too fucking numb, and I can't feel shit. I tried masturbating while high on coke once, and I don't think I've ever felt so frustrated in my life 😂 coke is not a sexy drug for me, at all. 

Weed turns me on way more than coke does and I don't think I'll ever stop smoking marijuana, as I sit here and enjoy my hippie speedball - a cup of coffee and a joint. However, I'm not turned on. I haven't even felt the urge for anything like that since he was here. I rarely felt it prior to that night, I'm sure it will decrease even more now … I think I'd like to try more pure cocaine someday, y'know without all of the extra shit, just the natural plant product. I'm pretty cool with all the natural drugs, I just tend to avoid the man-made ones. 

As I was falling asleep last night, I heard his name in the show that I was watching. It's an episodic type of show, one that I don't typically watch, but Hulu suggested it, and this isn't a regular character. I don't fucking understand. He's everywhere.

How? 

Why? 

My heart feels cold. 

And everything inside and outside of me feels wrong. 

I don't know what to do …

1js93v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1js93v8/arlo/,Arlo,"*I wrote this as a writing assignment and forgot about it for about a year, rediscovered it and wanted some feedback on it as I didn't get any to my memory.  Hope you enjoy it :>*  
  
  
On a sunny day, in a grassy field, there laid a man. As the sun rises on his glossy blond hair, pale white skin and beautiful blue eyes. Wearing a white mildly tattered white shirt and slightly damaged black pants. He wakes. As he takes in his surroundings, delirious and teary eyed from what seems to be a peaceful sleep, he thinks to himself:

 ""Who am I?"", ""Why am I here?"" and ""How did I get here?"". 

His questions went unanswered as his gets himself together and stands up. 



Observing his surroundings he sees a rural town with a big tower in the distance.

""Oh!"" he yelps, ""Maybe I can get some answers there!"". As he walks towards the town, he starts to ponder about himself. 

""Why don't I remember anything? Maybe I hit my head a little too hard."" He says to himself. As he walks, He starts to think even further about how weird his situation is. ""Why am I not hungry? I just woke up and don't seem to be sleepy so I must have slept for long, right? Shouldn't I be at the very least a bit hungry?"" He thinks to himself. 



As he nears the edge of town, he sees people coming out of their homes, getting ready for their morning routines, some take a morning stroll while others exercise in a morning jog, and even some who just wants to enjoy the morning air with a cup of coffee. 



The lost man approaches a person enjoying a cup of coffee, the latter, spotting the lost man stares the him in the face for a good few second and suddenly says in a cheery tone: ""Greetings Sir, can I help you?"" The lost man, slightly confused says: ""Hi there, Could you please tell me which town I am in?"" The man, in a slightly confused tone says: ""Well, you are in Amniea, the town of innovation of course?"" The lost man, confused says: ""I see... so, what is that big tower?"" 

The man, even more confused says: ""Well, that is the Spire of Arlo, where innovation comes to fruition..? If you want to know more you can always go inside."" So the lost man thanked the kind stranger and started to make his way to the big tower. 



Along the way, he encounters some particular persons. The first being a man so engrossed in a book he stood in the middle of the pathway, reading. The lost man, confused calls out to the mysterious reader. ""Hi there, it seems you are blocking the pathway, could you please move?"" 

The mysterious reader angrily grunts: ""Do you mind? I am READING!"". 

The lost man says: ""What are you reading that made you so engrossed in reading to the point you are standing in the middle of the pathway?"" The mysterious man say in an infuriated tone: ""You don't KNOW!? It's the Book of Arlo! The one who innovated innovation itself! He created everything you see around you! He-"" The mysterious and now obsessive reader continues to blabber on about Arlo and his achievements. 

The lost man slips away as the reader keeps ranting. 



The next peculiar person he encounters is an older woman, who appears to be around the age of 50 to 60. The lost man walks towards the her, unknowingly under the gaze of that woman. ""Good Morning young man!"" The woman hollers. 

The lost man jolted at the woman's remark, ""AH! Ah. You scared me!"" 

""Sorry Sir, I just wanted to say you look quite disheveled, are you alright?"" Said the older woman. ""Yes, I am alright"" Said the lost man. ""Just a little put off by some obsessed guy, he was ranting about someone named Arlo.""  He added. The woman, with a disgusted face and appalled tone says ""ARLO?! That good for nothing sham created all this folly he calls 'Innovation', that good for nothing created unnecessary creations and-"" The woman rants about how annoyed and dissatisfied she is about Arlo's innovations. Once again, The lost man slips away while she ranted.



Nearing the center of the town, the last Peculiar person the Lost man encounters is an unkempt, dirty man who appears to be homeless as he is sitting on a piece of cardboard. With a raspy voice the homeless man said: ""Spare change?"" the Homeless man mutters. ""Sorry, but I am sorry to say I am just as pennyless as you are."" Said the Lost man said. ""Ahh, sorry to bother you."" The Homeless man exclaimed. As the Lost man wonders what this guy going to be like, the Homeless man says: ""So where do you think you are headed?"" Confused, the Lost man says: ""I believe it is called the... Spire of Arlo..?""  The Homeless man says: ""That place is not what it seems. There is something going on in that building and I don't like it. If you are actually going to go in there, I wish you the best of luck."" 



The Lost man, now even more confused and now a little nervous, the lost man thanks the Homeless man and wishes him the best of luck as well.  

Approaching the building, He sees a set of sliding doors. As he approaches them, the open and after the Lost man entered is greeted from across the room with a very enthusiastic but stiff and practiced ""Greetings, Good Sir. Welcome to the Spire of Arlo, where innovation was innovated!"" Before the Lost man, was an emotionless, Plastic Doll faced woman with a red dress, a well mannered demeanor and a stiff unmoving stance. The Lost man asks the woman: ""Who might you be?"" The woman answered: ""My name is... unimportant, I shall be your Tour Guide in this tower, no need for payment, getting another member for the Followers of Arlo is payment enough!"" ""Tour Guide? what do you mean Tour Gui-"" The Lost man was cut off. 

""Please save your questions until after the initiation."" The woman exclaimed with an unchanging face. 

""But-"" 

""I said please save your questions."" 

The woman rebuked. 

After a short silence the woman continued. ""Please follow me for the tour, and No Touching."" 

After that last chilling remark, he made sure to keep that in mind. Then they enter what seems to be an elevator and the woman pushes one of the two buttons in the elevator. After arriving on the floor after what seemed like minutes, the woman exits the elevator and then commences the Tour.



""This is the first machine that Sir Arlo created, it's main purpose in unknown as there was no mention of this in his Journal. All we know is that only Arlo is the only one who can use it, and our great and glorious innovator disappeared after he created his last machine."" 



The two continued forward. 



""This next piece of art is the-"" as the woman continues from machine to machine, the Lost man feels a sense of dread. Remembering a few choice words used by the woman: ""no need for payment, getting another member for the Followers of Arlo is payment enough!"" ""Is this a Cult?!""

He thought to himself. ""I need to get out of here, but how?"" As panic slowly builds he leans up against a wall while the woman is explaining another piece of Arlo's work and suddenly feels a slight give to the wall. 

The Lost man thinks to himself: ""Huh, maybe it opens up?"" And so after waiting for the woman to fully turn around, as she was explaining almost obsessively a piece of Arlo's work, the Lost man takes the opportunity and pushes inward, the wall gives in and he stumbles backwards into a dusty old room filled with books and journals and a single desk and chair. The Lost man quickly closes the entrance back up while the woman was still explaining obsessively. 



The lost man approaches the desk and sees a book and what looks like a reinforced lock keeping the contents of the book closed and out of reach. 

On the lock there seems to be a pad instead of a key hole. ""This looks... familiar..."" the Lost man mutters. He puts his thumb up against the lock and it makes a humming sound and it suddenly opens up. Revealing the contents of this mysterious book to the Lost man. Once opened, a note fell out of the book and landed on the desk. The Lost man picked it up and read it. ""If you are reading this, that means you have acquired my personal journal. A journal that I have made sure to never be seen by the public eye. It also means my machine didn't take me far enough. Read the contents of this journal and follow it's instructions. Do not fail."" 

The instruction in the journal was about the first machine Arlo created. 



The instructions were as follows: 

1.) Pull the second and forth lever on the right side of the machine.

2.) Press the first, third, ninth then second colored buttons on the panel below the lever.

3.) Wait until the on the left of the panel bar fills up.

4.) Press the buttons on the panel again but in the order of green, blue, cyan, orange, navy blue, red, green again, yellow, red, lime green, blue, orange.

5.) Finally, Pull the biggest lever and get in the chamber before it closes, you only have 10 second to do so.



Now, equipped with mysterious knowledge, the Lost man exits the the hidden room cautiously as to not alert the Tour Guide, The Lost man doesn't know if the Tour Guide will stop him or not, so as a precaution, he slowly progresses towards the machine he now knows as the ""Chronius"".

As the Lost man progress towards the Chronius, he gets spotted by the Tour Guide. ""HEY! Why did you leave the tour!? Get back here!"" Now panicked, the Lost man dashes away, and the Tour Guide following distantly behind. Dodging and weaving, the Lost man navigates through a more packed section of the quote on quote ""Museum"" to hopefully lose his trail. Finding a spot to rest, the Lost man catches his breath and tries to make sense of where he currently is. Finding the right path he trudges on, the fatigue from running so much pulling him down, finally feeling the hunger he thought was missing, and the only things keeping him going is the unease of this place and the desperation of maybe finding something about himself. 



Suddenly, he hears a shout. ""I said get back here!"" The Tour Guide caught up. Startled by the shout, he tried to sprint but tripped and stumbled, dropping the journal. The Lost man ran without thinking, and when he realized he dropped the journal, he thought it was fine as he memorized the steps beforehand. Seeing the machine he bolted to the right side and Pulled the second and forth lever, He looked down to see the panel with colored buttons and pushed the first, third, ninth and then second buttons. 

waiting for the bar to fill up he hears the Tour Guide in the distance, the Lost man impatiently waits for the bar to fill up panicking as he hears the voice of the Tour Guide getting closer and closer, once it filled up he pressed the buttons in order. Green, blue, cyan, orange, navy blue, red, green again, yellow... He for got... He forgot the next color, distraught, basically giving up, he falls to his knees in despair. Awaiting the Tour Guide.

The Tour Guide finally shows up. Accepting his failure he looks up to see the Tour Guide slowly approaching, exhausted from running. As he looked at his end, sure he will get some kind of punishment for touching the machine, he sees the color of her dress... red... With a massive realization, he lept from the ground, pushing the red, lime green, blue and orange buttons, he pulled the largest lever with all his might and started to climb the machine to get into the chamber. 10-9-8 The Tour Guide started screaming at him with a furious tone to ""Get Off! You aren't allowed to climb there!"" 7-6-5 She clung to his shabby pants and he kicked her off, tearing and leaving a bit of his pants behind. 4-3-2 ""Thank goodness my pants were worn out"" He thought. Then he leapt into the chamber right as it closed. 1-0....



Suddenly, libraries of information flooded into his head. Every single creation in this museum and how to use it, every idea and thought written in those journals in that old room, every memory he had lost, he knew where had been, where his is, and where he was going, and most importantly, his name. His name, is Arlo.",1,1743875173.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Looking back, that time period feels like a sweet spot—especially when seen through the lens of *Friends*, which captured the cultural vibe so well. The fashion, the laid-back coffee shop culture, the everyday social interactions—it all seemed so authentic and grounded.

I often wish I could have experienced that period as an adult. It had just the right amount of technology. I love the scenes where characters use landline phones, leave funny voicemail messages, or scribble notes on a magnetic drawing board.

Yes, it’s unrealistic that they lived in such spacious New York apartments on modest salaries—but back then, property prices in many places were still within reach for ordinary people. The world hadn’t priced everyone out yet.

There’s also something magical about how people reconnected in that era. When someone from the past showed up, it was a genuine surprise—you had no idea what they’d been up to because Facebook, LinkedIn, and the rest didn’t exist. That kind of mystery is rare now.

I also love that Chandler had a steady IT job at a time when IT wasn’t nearly as mainstream. Most people didn’t even fully understand what his job was, which was kind of the joke—but also very true for that time.

What really gets me are the intangibles: the strong friend groups, the face-to-face social life, the simplicity and optimism of that era. Hanging out regularly with a group of close friends was *normal*, not something you had to schedule a month in advance.

Watching *Friends* takes me right back, and I often wish I could’ve lived that time as an adult in my 20s or 30s. It just seemed... better. More human.

1js93jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1js93jn/i_had_an_awful_terrible_proposal_and_i_dont_know/,I had an awful terrible proposal and I don’t know how to get over the disappointment.,"My partner (29m) and I (28f) have been together for 5 years. We love each other a lot and have a ton of similar interests, but I am a hopeless romantic and he is an adhd bad planner, the kind of person to forget about birthdays and not ever plan dates. We’re already in a domestic partnership and have talked a lot about getting engaged so that’s not a question of y/n. I’ve always dreamed of a cute proposal, it could be cheesy like a surprise picnic on the beach, one of those silly pokeballs that say “I choose you”, at disney (we both love Disney), a candlelit patio at a nice restaurant, anything that gives us that emotional special moment and shows his effort/planning and represents us as a couple. 
Since I’ve been worried about his ability to plan, I’ve been extremely direct about what I’d want to make it simple: maybe 1 member of my family popping out to celebrate after, to hear something authentic and sweet from him, a surprise photographer who we’d both vibe with since I’m also a photographer, and to feel cute on that day. I am the eldest daughter of immigrants and always the one planning trips, forced to be the planner, blamed if things go wrong, and I just wanted one day for myself. Bf has comforted me over this and my previous feelings about criticism/never being enough to people since I’m “the independent stubborn one”. 

We’ve been on an international trip now for 2 weeks, week 1 in a different country than now. We had a big argument there where i was upset he didn’t help me plan anything for our itinerary, procrastinated packing and logistics to watch Netflix (so I did everything), and just didn’t feel like we were in it together. In a moment where I felt really down, I said “I hope you’re not planning to propose soon, because I’m not ready to say yes until I feel heard by you, like we can lean on each other for support”. We resolved things, he apologized, and has mostly been better since then. 

In our current country, we were visiting my grandparents who I was close to growing up, and my mom and much younger sister joined for a week from the US since none of us had seen grandparents since pre-Covid. My mom/sister/bf and I did a day trip to a very touristy/scenic place (think a UNESCO site), grandparents decided not to come because they were tired. I was ready for a hike up, had my camera gear on me, and was really excited to show this spot to bf. Bf and I went ahead to grab a snack at the gate, then my mom showed up with “a family friend of your aunt who is a photographer building his portfolio who wants a few pics of you guys for his social media”. Bf seems a little surprised and uncomfortable, but my mom is also very controlling/demanding, so we give in. Bf then spills a few drops of coffee on his shirt, and my mom proceeds to INSIST that we buy ridiculous souvenir shirts to wear instead. Bf and I both adamantly refuse and are annoyed by the shopkeepers all pressuring us, she buys them anyways, I proclaim in the shop I don’t care and just want to get on with the hike.
We start walking up and photog is nonstop snapping photos of us. Doing EVERYTHING. Drinking water. Putting on a jacket. Pictures of me taking pictures from 2 feet away from my face. I try to nicely suggest he get photos of my mom and sister too, which he briefly does here and there before forcing bf and I to pose.
I’m getting extremely annoyed and just want to be left alone but mom says to not be rude and that it would be disrespectful to my aunt to treat her friend like that. We get to the top and I want to enjoy the view and talk to bf about cultural significance, have him take some photos of me and vice versa on my camera, photog will not leave us alone no matter what I request. I’m ready to scream in his face, I feel gross and sweaty, and want to just explore around. I am also a model/actor so I’m tired of this feeling like a photoshoot. 

We continue along the path to the next viewpoint, I turn to grab something from my bag, and then I turn around and bf is suddenly getting down on one knee. At this point I am dressed in all black dirty clothes, pissed off at this photographer who won’t leave me alone, haven’t gotten a single moment alone to enjoy the day, and had just told him a week ago I wasn’t ready to be proposed to. My heart drops to my stomach and the first words out of my mouth are “no no no not like this”. He looks panicked, starts saying “oh okay..” and getting up awkwardly, then I realize there are 4 MORE PHOTOGRAPHERS/VIDEOGRAPHERS suddenly all within 10ft. I’m about to cry because I know that this happens once in my lifetime, I’ve envisioned it a hundred ways but not like this, and it is fully ruined, but now tourists and my family are watching and one of the guys runs over to literally put a mic on bf. I look at him and say “are you serious?? Uhh just keep going” and he makes the worlds shortest proposal speech, I barely process what’s happening, I say yes so this moment can be over, everyone cheers, we kiss, I put my actor face on, and I am dying inside. We are then forced to take a million posed photos which we both despise, he has no idea what’s going on because they’re all talking in a different language, we both have photo fatigue, I feel ugly and terrible, and I want to run away and cry. I have told him so so so many times I just wanted to feel cute during my engagement, but the worst part is that there was a whole damn bag of clean laundry in the car. I would’ve worn literally anything else - jeans, t shirt, nice hoodie, sundress, literally anything that wasn’t black leggings where you can see pantylines, high white socks, dirty sneakers, and a black thermal shirt I hadn’t washed for 3 days. He/my mom/my sister could’ve shoved my favorite band t shirt into a backpack for me and I would’ve felt prettier. Knowing it was gonna be a full on photoshoot with 5 fucking photographers, I wish someone grabbed me an eyeliner, falsies, earrings, ANYTHING to feel like I didn’t just sweat all day. We get down 2 hours later and we are both clearly not feeling great - it felt like the whole damn day was a modeling job I didn’t get paid for. I try to explain to my mom that the photographer should not have followed us up the whole time if this was a surprise and that she knows bf also hates photos so he was fatigued, she scolds me about being grateful that she and my aunt planned all of this and the guy said it would make for a better “story video” (bf asked for help weeks ago and then got no say or info on anything, and literally told mom it was a bad idea for photog to follow us up because I’d hate it when he found out). Bf thought grandparents were coming and it would mean a lot to me, then no one told him they weren’t until it was too late. I try to gently tell aunt that it didn’t go great and I felt uncomfortable, she says “we all tried so hard to make this great for you, it was a lot of work for me to plan, you should have a better attitude.” Mom says “you should be happy - don’t be picky, sometimes you have to think about other people too and their feelings” (meaning her/my aunt/the photography team).. We get driven to a fancy restaurant that uncle picked “for us”, I tell them I need a few minutes privately with bf for the first time all day. They’re annoyed but go in, I immediately start crying in the parking lot and bf felt bad and understood why. Within 5 minutes, mom comes out to scold me and say “don’t embarrass your uncle and make your grandparents wait to eat, you’re humiliating yourself, hurry up, you’re being so annoying”. 

Bf and I get back to the hotel and I sob until I run out of tears and fall asleep, then cry more at 6am the next day. Over the next few hours, bf asked if I meant the yes and if I could let him try again, more privately, where he’d arrange everything with no outside input, because he wants to give me my fairytale moment and I deserve it. He used a placeholder ring since I want to pick the real one together, and asked if he could repropose once we pick one out. 

It’s been a few days now and while it’s very meaningful to me that he was so apologetic and completely understood where he screwed up, I am so sad. I feel like no one heard a single thing I wanted, I got gaslit by my family, the photographer disrespected my wishes, and bf really should’ve planned better and stood up for me when I told the photographer to back off, even if it was via google translate (especially because he is paying for this whole thing!!). He confessed that he thought about canceling after what I said on the other part of the trip but felt awkward because my mom/aunt had already arranged things by then. Im annoyed that he entrusted so much to my mom/aunt when he knows that my mom stresses me out like crazy and invalidates my feelings often and I’m not close to my aunt and have talked about how much I differ from her preferences in the past. I’m mad that this was probably all very expensive. I am angry that my mom keeps saying to be grateful, that it was hard for her and my aunt to make this happen, yet they kept my bf so out of the loop and didn’t even give him the chance for input! Even now, the photographer has only communicated with my aunt on getting photos to us, and she sent a few photos to the family chat with “they sent me the album so I picked a few to show you guys!” We still cannot access the full album since we have US phone numbers and can’t make an account, and I don’t know how I’m even going to get this stupid content. 

I don’t care how selfish this makes me, but this was supposed to be my special day. My needs are rarely put first, I always prioritize the happiness of my siblings and parents, I am constantly told I’m too dramatic and stubborn. This was supposed to be the only day where it was ok to focus on me and my partner. I wanted to feel pretty and loved and mostly importantly, fully heard for once by someone. I never want to see my extended family again, who I’m not even close to outside of my grandparents. I don’t know if it’s stupid to want a reproposal, but I just want to think of this one as a practice run. I wish I could lobotomize myself and forget it ever happened. My heart hurts and I am just so deeply disappointed. I love my bf and always imagined a future with him, but I feel so unheard. It wasn’t about the actual proposal, it was about wanting to feel like I could prioritize ME and my wants for once instead of taking care of everyone else’s needs. I know this isn’t the end of the world, there are bigger problems out there, I should be grateful, and we can have a long happy life together, but I wanted this silly dumb romantic moment so badly and have dreamed about it my whole life. Every time I think about when he started to get down on one knee, I want to vomit. What if he tries again but it feels meaningless? What if I don’t feel anything? What if I’m just disappointed and unheard more? 

TLDR: had a shitty proposal where a lot of things went wrong, bf screwed up and feels bad, photographer ruined the day, family is gaslighting me, and I needed to vent this to strangers. ",0,1743875150.0,offmychest,4,0.5,False

I am hoping this reflection of my experience in Syria and knowledge could help you in some way.

**A Different Kind of Simplicity**

Stepping back into Syria after many years felt like walking into a time warp. The internet was spotty, daily life followed old routines, and government controls still shaped a lot of what people could access. Modern conveniences that I’d grown used to elsewhere were harder to come by. Yet, beneath all that, there was a hum of possibility waiting to be noticed.

I realized that during the war change was brewing, and still is. Even with all the hurdles, there was a buzz of creativity and resilience. Below are three observations I picked up along the way.

**When People Move, Ideas Move Too** 

I remember a particular intersection in Idlib that used to be almost empty. This time, it was alive with new eateries, small shops, and chatter. I found a café that felt straight out of a European city, with sleek decor, a big menu, and even outdoor tables where friends could linger over coffee.

What surprised me the most was finding more western desserts like Tiramisu in stores not too far from where you can get our good ol’ fan favorite Shuaibiat (It felt like we couldn’t get anything else back then). It showed me how people’s curiosity grows when they’re given fresh options. I also stumbled upon a fantastic shawarma spot. They had great branding, friendly service, and a clear commitment to quality. It set a higher standard for everyone around.

All these changes didn’t stem from some big businesses. They came from people. Many families who moved to Idlib brought their ideas and customs with them. Those new perspectives sparked real energy and progress. It reminded me that sometimes, *you don’t need a huge budget for innovation, just a new point of view.*

**Tough Conditions Lead to Smart Solutions** 

Back when I last visited, getting online felt like winning the lottery. Now, there’s 4G, Wi-Fi, hospital booking systems, and payment apps like ShamCash. This is all happening despite sanctions and limited resources.

Local graduates have been vital to this shift. Some of them created the necessary hardware and software themselves. Others teamed up with Syrians abroad who had more resources. I’ve also heard about young innovators, even teenagers, who build small inventions aimed at solving daily problems in Syria. It’s not just about finding ways to survive. It’s about thinking bigger and looking forward.

It’s proof that when resources are scarce, people often come up with inventive ideas. *Purpose, it turns out, can be a powerful motivator.*

**The Syrian Diaspora Still Makes a Difference** 

Syrians scattered around the world continue to play a role in their home country’s progress. They share advice, help rebuild, and sometimes provide services that people on the ground can’t easily get. They do it not for profit, but because they care.

Of course, most changes happen within Syria itself. Still, there’s a quiet influence from those who live abroad. They bring their connections, their experiences, and their hope back to the people who need it most. *For many Syrians outside their homeland, helping isn’t only a business venture. It’s something that touches their hearts.*

**Conclusion** 

Right now, Syria needs expertise in every field. It needs collaboration, mutual learning, and a shared vision for something better. What I observed convinced me that Syrians both at home and abroad have the passion and the skills to make real progress. The groundwork is there. Now we just have to tap into our collective commitment, stay connected, and believe in what we can build together.",0,1743875003.0,Syria,1,0.5,False

Just received and tested a Polish Type W Combat Ration — and wow, this one is a beast. Ordered it from u/MREhouse and it arrived safely, well-packed, and without any issues. Big shoutout to them — reliable service and everything was fresh & intact. 


This ration is designed for the Polish military and here's what you get:

Main Dish:
Leczo with sausage (300g) – A spicy tomato-based stew with sausage and peppers. Hearty and very flavorful. Heated it over the included solid fuel stove and it tasted surprisingly homemade.

Snacks:
Special Crackers 
Fruit jam – Great combo with the crackers
Fruit-cereal bar
Salted peanuts
Fruit jelly dessert – Smooth texture, not overly sweet

Drinks:
Instant fruit tea – Really nice warm or cold
Isotonic drink 
Black coffee 


🔥 Field Test
The stove setup is easy. Fuel tablets lit fast, and I had hot Leczo within 10 minutes. Everything from utensil quality to packaging screams ""field-ready."" Didn’t test the water tab, but it’s great to have it in case of emergency.

Great variety – sweet, salty, protein, carbs – you won’t get bored.
If you're collecting, prepping, or just love trying new rations, I definitely recommend this one. Happy to share more pics if anyone's curious!

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?

It's a particularly beautiful day. It's sunny, partly cloudy and you plan on going to the beach on tomorrow morning (it's Friday).

The elevators are currently under a maintenance check in the B-2 level so you are unable to take an elevator up to the lobby like you usually do. You walk out from the parking garage and go along the sidewalk and toward the complex. You enter the plaza, approach your tower, and look up at it.

You enter the lobby and enter one of the local elevators. You take a deep breath in, awaiting your weekend plans, but preparing yourself for a long day. It will be busy.

You look at the keypad and press the button for the 24th floor. It flows a bright yellow, but before the doors are fully closed an hand reaches in and the door stop closing, then they open back up again.

A man enters the elevator, and greets you. You smile and greet him back.

As the elevator begins to go up, you and the gentleman make small talk. You tell him about your 9-year-old daughter, and how you will be going to the beach the next day. The gentleman is going to see him 7-year-old son's little league game on Sunday.

The elevator reaches your destination, and you step out first. The man stays in the elevator, and you part ways with him.

You walk up some steps, where a door opens up to a small lobby.

Looking ahead, you notice an office. As you pass by, a lady looks up from her computer and smiles. You smile back.

As you're walking past a long stretch of narrow windows, you glance at the outside world from 300 feet above. The sun shines on your face, and you begin to feel warm inside.

It's not a bad day.

You walk by some table setups and stop in front of your company's door to open it. You step into a field of office cubicles, most are largely empty, but some people have arrived early. Looking to your right, you see a smaller empty room - your office.

You set your bag down on the floor and lean it against your desk, and you take your blazer off and drape it over the back of your chair. You decide to get a small snack from the mini-kitchen.

You walk across the field of offices and greet all of your coworkers along the way. After heading into the mini-kitchen, you prepare a cup of coffee for yourself and grab a bran muffin from the snack shelf. After you get your coffee, you head back to your office, set your mini breakfast on your desk, and plop down onto your seat. You power up your computer, plug in your printer, and you turn your chair to face the windows while snacking on your muffin.

I’m at a crossroads and would love some perspective from those further along in their careers.

I’ve been playing instruments for years, and I started learning music production in the summer of 2022. It began as a hobby, but about a year and a half in, I realized I wanted to pursue it professionally. Since then, I’ve been putting in 20+ hours a week improving my skills, connecting with other artists, and laying the groundwork to transition into audio work full-time.

This is the first thing I’ve done that’s consistently fueled my passion and focus.

Here’s where I’m torn:

On one hand, the hands-on experience and mentorship could be invaluable. On the other, with how advanced home recording setups have become — and given how vibrant and collaborative the arts community is in my city — I’m wondering if it might be more worthwhile to stay independent.

I’ve also heard that internships can be major time sinks — sometimes amounting to long hours doing menial tasks just to pick up small bits of knowledge. I’m nearing 30, and I’m not sure I can afford to spend years getting coffee in exchange for insights that I might be able to get through other means.

So I’m wondering:
Is a studio internship still a valuable path in 2025, or would I be better off investing that time into my own studio and community connections?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through this — especially folks who have taken either (or both) of these paths.

It’s now just me and my two kids (13 & 14 yr olds). My husband and I have traveled around together, but I’ve never traveled alone. 

I’m planning a trip for this fall, for me and my two children, to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland. I have a little anxiety about payment methods, however. 

Long story summarized: last spring my husband and I traveled to the UK, Norway, and Iceland. We informed our bank of each country we would be visiting and which dates we’d be in that country. However, because my husband had an amazing cash-back credit card, we’d be primarily using that for the duration of our travels. While in Edinburgh, I ran across the street to grab us some coffees and breakfast and had forgotten to grab the credit card from my husband, but I had my debit card so I attempted to use it for the purchase. It declined- over and over, it kept declining. No big deal.. I ran back to the hotel and grabbed the credit card, got the coffees and that was that. I told my husband what had happened and he thought it was odd. So later that day, we tried the debit card (Mastercard) again at a different shop and same story. We said oh well and moved on. Had an awesome trip.

I closed the credit card shortly after he passed. If I try to apply for a credit card, with my nearly non existent credit history, I’m only going to be approved for what I assume is like a $500-1000 dollar limit. That won’t work because I’ll be traveling for multiple weeks. 

What are my options? Is there some sort of international prepaid card that works everywhere a credit card would work? I’m terrified of the thought of traveling all the way there, thinking I’ve done everything right, and then having no way to pay for anything. I am going to pre-book everything I can before we leave (airfare, lodging, airport transportation, ferry, and rental car) but I’m talking just our day to day spending like parking, food, shopping, and entrance fees.

1js8u9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1js8u9v/i_switched_to_javy_protein_coffee_for_a/,I Switched to Javy Protein Coffee for a Month—Here's the Truth,"Hey guys, so I’ve spent the past month testing something I kept seeing pop up everywhere online: **Javy Protein Coffee**. Like a lot of people, my morning coffee ritual is sacred—but expensive. Between daily Starbucks runs and afternoon energy crashes, I figured there had to be something better. After reading a ton of **Javy coffee reviews**, curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to see if it lived up to the hype.

**Why I Chose Javy Coffee**

To start, I wasn’t just looking for a way to save money—though ditching my daily $5 latte habit wouldn’t hurt. Mostly, I wanted a healthier way to keep my caffeine routine and maybe get some added nutrition. Javy caught my eye because of its unique combination of real Arabica coffee, whey protein, and prebiotics. According to the **Javy coffee ingredients** list, there’s no sugar added, which was appealing, since my sugar crashes were becoming brutal.

I went with the French Vanilla flavor, ordered directly from their site ([**check it out here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)), and crossed my fingers.

**Taste and Texture—Honestly Surprising**

My biggest fear about **Javy protein coffee** was taste. I've tried protein coffees before, and usually they’re chalky or artificial tasting. The first time I mixed Javy (two scoops into iced almond milk), I was genuinely surprised. It tasted smooth and rich—not exactly like a café latte, but miles ahead of typical protein shakes. Definitely no gritty texture, which was a relief. After playing around a bit, I found mixing it with oat milk and a tiny splash of vanilla creamer was ideal for me. It really did mimic a classic iced coffee pretty well.

**Energy Levels and Hunger**

Here’s the part where things got interesting. Usually, my regular coffee would hit me fast, but I'd crash by 11 AM, desperately craving sugary snacks. After switching fully to **Javy coffee protein**, that mid-morning crash didn’t come. The protein seemed to balance out the caffeine nicely. I felt steady and energized until lunch, and I definitely noticed less sugar cravings overall. Nothing miraculous, but noticeable enough that coworkers even commented on my newfound lack of snack runs.

**Did it Affect My Weight or Health?**

Honestly, in just a month, I didn’t lose any dramatic weight, but I did drop a couple pounds without really changing anything else. I’m guessing this was from cutting out sugary café drinks and midday snacks. Another small bonus was better digestion—probably from the prebiotics included. My stomach felt calmer and noticeably less bloated throughout the day.

I also took their short quiz on their site ([**try the quiz here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?uid=34951&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)), which actually helped pinpoint which blend suited my lifestyle best.

**Value for the Money**

Here's where I think Javy really shines. When I first saw the prices in some **Javy protein coffee reviews**, it seemed slightly high, around $30 a bag. But doing the math, it ended up costing me roughly $1.50 per serving, compared to the $5 coffees I was buying before. Over time, that’s a significant saving. Plus, the convenience of making it at home saved me tons of time—no more lines or drive-through hassles.

**Any Downsides?**

The main downside I found is that it might not fully satisfy hardcore coffee enthusiasts who prefer fresh, brewed espresso. It’s instant coffee at its core, though honestly the quality was impressive for what it is. Also, it's not dairy-free—it has a small lactose content, so lactose-intolerant friends should keep that in mind.

**Final Thoughts**

After a full month of daily use, **Javy coffee** turned out to be exactly what I hoped—a tasty, convenient, healthier, and cheaper alternative to my old coffee routine. If you’re skeptical like I was, I think it’s worth a shot. Not a magical cure-all, but definitely something I'll keep drinking.

Even I’ve done that rather *recently* and while I am almost amused at what you all could guess in regards of *what* would put *me* out of my comfort zone - I have an episode to roll out for you all.

Now, my dear employees, consider trying something new and unfamiliar and if you are wondering why;
Because growth doesn’t happen in the cozy confines of routine. It happens when you challenge yourself, when you take risks, and when you dare to be more than you were yesterday. And let’s be honest, if you’re working for VoxTek, you’re already a cut above the rest. Why not push that boundary a little *further*?

Here’s the deal: stepping out of your comfort zone doesn’t mean diving headfirst into chaos. It’s about calculated risks. Maybe it’s presenting that bold idea in the next team meeting. Maybe it’s learning a new skill that’s been on your radar. Or maybe it’s as simple as trying a new coffee flavor at the break room. 

And let me assure you, the rewards are worth it. You’ll gain confidence, discover hidden talents, and maybe even spark a new passion. Plus, it gives you a story to tell - something to brag about even, if you wish.

So here’s my challenge to you: this week(end), do one thing that scares you just a little. It doesn’t have to be monumental.
Remember, we here at VoxTek Enterprises thrive on innovation and boldness.

*Trust me with your well-being*

1js8tv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyBreakRoom/comments/1js8tv7/cant_stand_sahm/,Can’t stand SAHM,"I’m sorry I’m gonna get ALOT of hate for this, I just need to get it off my chest. I put in my two weeks notice today. I cannot stand the SAHM I work for. She’s gone through 8 nannies in 2 years. Now I don’t hate stay at home moms, but this one is taking advantage of me. 

The first thing is I was brought on for CHILD CARE. I understand being a mom is a lot of work, so I was fully supportive of when she said she needed a few hours a week to herself. She’d go to pilates, coffee with friends, and get her nails done. I also made it clear I was here strictly for childcare, but in the past week this has gone down the drain. At first, she would just say “can you help me and sweep the floor, sorry but I could really use the help”. I had extra time and I’m nice so I said sure. However, the next day when I was giving the kids a bath, she got MAD and said I was taking too long with the kids, she said  “I need you up here with me, I need you to set the table”. Okay, I’m not a mind reader and excuse me for wanting to supervise a 4 year old child in the bath🙄. I didn’t want to start a fight (totally shouldn’t have done this I should have said something), so I just set the table. Later she calls the family to dinner and just hands me a broom without saying anything….I’m here for childcare not adult care….so I’m just awkwardly sweeping while the family is having dinner.

Yesterday, I come home and she texts me a long list of tasks. They’re all “fold the laundry, make the lunches, make the kids dinner”. Half of the laundry was the parents! And I spent so much time doing duties for the kids I spent no time with them!! I think I spent an hour total out of the 10 hour work day actually interacting with them. 

Anyways, this is another little thing that bugged me. She asked if I could come to dinner with her and the kids and her mom friends. One of them brought up how the kids always have the cutest outfits and how they have the cutest lunches. She took credit, and that pissed me off because I do all those things. I make sure the kids always have their favorite foods and cutest outfits and their homework is always done. One of the mom friends even said “I don’t know how you do it all” and she said “it’s not easy but I just love it” as I was standing right next to her, not even a thank you. It pissed me off she basically took credit for my work. For context, I also get to work 7:30AM and most days don’t leave until 7:00-8:00PM, I’m there when the kids wake up and go to bed. 

Also, she asks me to come in on my days off and gets mad when I can’t. It’s been about a month, we agreed Monday-Friday and she asked me once if I could come in Saturday because she “really needed the help”. I needed the extra money so I said yes. But I think she took that to say “yes I’m free every Saturday”. Now, she asks me if I can come every Saturday and Sunday and if I say no she guilt trips me and says “well I could really use the help”, girl you’re a STAY AT HOME MOM! I called out sick once and she did the same thing she went “well now I have no childcare thank you” girl YOU ARE THE CHILDCARE. She also has told me “if you ever need a day off or want to sleep in let me know! I can take over”. I had to go to a doctors appointment and I let her know before I scheduled it so we could work around her schedule, and she said “ummm can’t you go on your time off”…. not to mentioned she asked me if I could work the entire day of thanksgiving when we already agreed I’d have it off, ma’am I HAVE A FAMILY TOO! 

Also, I made it clear at the beginning that I could not do sick days, I have an auto-immune deficiency I will go to the hospital if I get sick. She doesn’t care, I’ll get to work and she’ll be like “so-and-so is sick by the way” and just leave me with the sick kid. She’ll run out the door so fast I won’t have a moment to talk to her. Also, that time I called out sick, I was sick in the hospital because her kid gave me RSV. Her 4 year old had RSV and she was crying saying “I just need your help I’m so scared he’s going to end up in the hospital”, ran out the door to pilates and left me with the sick kid. Her kid was fine I WAS THE ONE IN THE HOSPITAL. She didn’t care she just gave me a guilt trip. 

If anyone is wondering what she does all day; she wakes up and goes to Starbucks, then goes to the gym for about 3 hours and then does an hour long yoga class each day comes home and takes a 3 hour nap, then she takes herself out to lunch and gets a massage, every single day…then she gets her “appointments” which is basically nails and hair. Then she eats dinner by herself at home and tells me to take the kids elsewhere so they don’t interrupt her dinner, and then she takes a bath and goes to bed. 

The kids cry all the time because “mom is never around she always goes to the gym” and it’s so sad. Literally why would you have 3 kids and ignore them all. ",9,1743874441.0,NannyBreakRoom,10,0.91,False

1js8qcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1js8qcn/imagine_a_world_without_story_telling/,Imagine a world without story telling.,"Imagine a world without stories.  

No exposés on corruption, no deep dives into the lives of the unheard, no sharp-witted columns that make you laugh and cry in equal measure. Imagine opening your favorite news site and finding… nothing. Just a blank page where the voices of journalists and creators once lived.  

This isn’t some dystopian fantasy—it’s a quiet storm brewing beneath our digital lives. The culprit? Ad blockers.  

Ad blockers, those silent gatekeepers of an “uninterrupted” browsing experience, have become the invisible wrecking ball to journalism and content creation. They promise users a cleaner web, free of flashing banners and autoplay videos. But they also strip away the lifeblood of the very people who make the internet worth visiting: journalists and creators.  

Every time an ad is blocked, it’s not just a pop-up that disappears—it’s a paycheck for a reporter who spent weeks investigating a story. It’s funding for a photographer capturing moments that define our times. It’s the livelihood of creators who pour their hearts into making content that informs, entertains, and connects us.  

Consider this: advertising underpins nearly 90% of online content. Without it, most of what we consume—from breaking news to quirky YouTube videos—wouldn’t exist. A 2023 report by PageFair estimated that ad blockers cost publishers over $35 billion annually in lost revenue. That’s not just numbers; it’s real people—journalists, editors, photographers—losing their jobs, their platforms, their voices.  

And here’s the irony: many of the people using ad blockers are the ones who value journalism and creativity the most. They’re discerning readers who want quality content but don’t realize that blocking ads is like walking into a coffee shop every day, enjoying the ambiance, but never buying a cup of coffee.  

Sure, ads can be annoying—no one loves being interrupted by a pop-up about car insurance while reading an investigative piece on climate change. But what if we reimagined this relationship? What if instead of blocking ads entirely, we found ways to make them less intrusive and more meaningful?  

There are tools out there—like (Turn Off the Lights) or (Dark Reader) —that improve the browsing experience without disrupting the ecosystem that keeps content alive. But these tools weren’t built to address journalism’s existential crisis. They make the web easier on the eyes but don’t tackle its biggest challenge: balancing user experience with sustainable funding models for creators and journalists alike.  

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Journalism isn’t just about reporting facts; it’s about holding power to account, amplifying marginalized voices, and fostering understanding in an increasingly divided world. Content creators aren’t just entertainers; they’re storytellers who bring joy, knowledge, and connection to millions. Together, they form the backbone of our digital public square—a place where ideas are shared, debated, and celebrated.  

So next time you open an article or watch a video you love, think about what made it possible. Behind every headline is a journalist working late into the night; behind every video is a creator hustling to make ends meet. They matter—not just to themselves but to all of us who rely on their work to stay informed and inspired.

Ad blockers may promise convenience, but they come at a cost we can no longer afford: silence where there should be stories.

I’m 36M, 5’9”. Average bodyfat, above average muscle. I have a good job. My hobbies (DnD, bouldering, hiking, renfaire, HEMA) are nerdy and outdoorsy. 

Friends, family, coworkers, and even strangers regularly compliment me on what I wear, how I smell, and several women have repeatedly complimented my physique. Dental hygienists say I’m doing a great job.

Two of my closest friends are women; they feel safe enough with me to regularly meet alone, and they both say I’m one of their favorite people. I try to be emotionally transparent around people I feel safe with. I invite people to tell their story, and I try to reflect an image of them back that emphasizes the qualities they want to be known for.

In 15 years I’ve been on 5 first dates and one second date. I’ve never been in a relationship, but I crave that connection.

**Efforts**

As a line from a song goes, I’ve always tried to “see life as a means to a triumph.” I lost 150 pounds, and I lift five days a week with protein and creatine. While supporting my dying parents, I clawed and schmoozed my way from living on the streets to making 1.5x the median income for my area. I have a job offer for 2x. I got here with no support network.

I chose jobs *specifically* on criteria that would make me better at socializing. I still struggle in places, but I went from not being able to maintain eye-contact or speak without a stutter to being told, “I wish I could be calm and witty like you.” I have several friend groups. I’m so well liked at work that it's an inside joke.

I have a skincare routine: cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen, exfoliant and wax.

While I have not been to therapy, I have done a lot for my mental health. I meditate to great effect, and I try to practice the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. A decade ago, when I was wrestling with depression, I self-medicated with psychedelics, and that helped tremendously.

I’ve never known anyone who has improved their life like I have.

**Struggles**

To find a relationship, I’ve tried to make connections through friends, parties, MeetUps, but I connect very slowly to strangers, and at this point, I’ve met all my friends’ friends and families. Consequently, I don’t meet new people very often. I don’t approach random women in the grocery store. I’ve tried Speed Dating, but the events in my area have been inconsistent, and I’ve only been able to schedule a few. The bulk of my effort has turned to online dating. That is where all my dates have come from.

For ten years I’ve been on some combination of Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OKCupid, PoF, Boo, eHarmony, Happn, CoffeMeetsBagel, Match, Chemistry, Feeld, and some lesser known ones. I have exhausted the userbase of each while paying for premium accounts and SuperLikes/SuperSwipes/Roses/Boosts/etc.. I’ve pulled the data, and on Tinder alone, I’ve swiped on 125,000 profiles (<-100,000; 25,000->). I got one date out of that. I think I’m spending close to $700 to get each date. All my matches come from Superlikes/Superswipes/Roses, because I basically get 0 likes organically.

I’ve never said anything sexual on an app. I’m constantly refining my profiles. My pictures aren’t professional, but they check all the boxes. Outdoor, indoor, smiling, face clearly visible, active hobby shot, group photo for social proof, a variety of poses, and me with my cat. My bios come very close to succinctly communicating who I am and what I’m looking for.

The few dates I've been on have been coffee dates. They begin and end with hugs. The conversation feels natural, equal, and not superficial. Its only once led to a second date.

My window is closing, and I am despairing.

**Problems**

My self-diagnosis is a combination of physical unattractiveness, and natural inclinations toward avoidance and introversion.

The number-one thing Redditors tell me when I share my profiles is to shave my head; I’m badly balding. Minoxidil and finasteride have arrested the loss, but most of the damage is beyond repair. I don’t want to shave. I have a lot of memories associated with my hair and I hate the bald look. I think liking my own appearance is more important than conforming to the tastes of others, and if that’s what keeps me from being loved, was being loved worth it?

I also have very crooked teeth. I’m considering straightening them soon, but it’s still going to be years before I can smile with an open mouth.

I have ghastly pores that haven’t responded to any remedy. They don't bother me, but I imagine people notice them.

On the social side, while I have managed to accrue more friends than some people, it has only come with great, conscious effort and long periods of being in proximity with those people. I do not make connections easily, and I don’t naturally enjoy the process of getting there.

While I go to parties and bars, I dread it, and I spend most of my life feeling like a dollop of oil in the river.

I just don’t meet a lot of people, and I cannot bond quickly enough with the people I do meet. I think I’ve been formally acquainted with only about 75 people in the last 8 years, and only 5 of those have I gone on to be friends.

**Consolations**

I’m not bitter or angry. I don’t fault anyone for having preferences; I have my own that I don’t want to be faulted for. I won’t even talk about my struggles if I’m feeling especially frustrated about it. I’m mostly content in life. I have friends and privileges and security.

I shouldn’t feel ashamed for being excluded from love and intimacy. It’s not a unique experience. There are Slavic boys having their guts minced by shrapnel right now who never got the chance either. Why should I expect better?

This is the experience put before me, and I should accept that.

**Conclusion**

I've tried very hard for a very long time, and it feels as if there were laws of physics conspiring against my success here. I feel embarrassed for carrying on as if I didn't know about gravity. I should admit my situation.

The effort has left me deeply exhausted. When I match with someone every few months, I don’t even feel excited anymore. I just want to close the app and not think about it. It’s more than just feeling like a chore; it feels like learned helplessness. That combined with the clock and the totality of my failure, I feel increasingly that I should admit my situation. There would be more dignity in it.

1js8pbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/1js8pbc/how_the_power_of_leadership_in_mass_effect/,How the Power of Leadership in Mass Effect Resonates with me Stronger than Ever.,"Hi guys, this is my first time posting on reddit. I've been reading posts periodically about Mass Effect for years. It's one of my favorite trilogies of all time and has been with me in my darkest moments.

I wanted to share with you a short story related to this saga that I am excited to share. Here it goes:

Yesterday, in the silence of the night and enjoying my late night coffee, I started over **Mass Effect** trilogy.

Why? Are you asking?

Because it is not only one of my favorite sagas, it is more than that, it is an example of **leadership.**

**Commander Shepard**, is a figure that has always managed to inspire me to take control of my life.

Shepard doesn't complain, he doesn't protest, he doesn't victimize, **he acts.**

And that, in a world where mental noise has taken over, is worth gold.

He is not perfect, he does not have all the answers but he acts when no one else wants to. And that is what defines **a true leader.**

Act even knowing that you may fail, that you will be judged and criticized.

In a society where mistakes are penalized so much, where we **fear the judgment** of others, it is difficult to act and be oneself. It is hard to put **your values** before everything else.

And therein lies Shepard's **courage**. He says what no one else wants to say, he is direct and has his sense of justice.

A part of me feels, that I have the part **of the commander** inside him. I know, because sometimes it has come out.

Sometimes even surprising me. How is it possible that I, who **fear the judgment** of others, can make **difficult decisions?**

They are strange situations, as if someone else were taking possession of my body or an **unbreakable instinct** was possessing me.

**And when that happens I say to myself**: “I feel free, I feel that I was born to give more to the world and I am not contributing, all that I am capable of.”

And that's why I picked up Mass Effect, because **the part of Shepard inside me is calling to me more than ever.**

I am playing, responding and acting with Shepard as if she were my **liberated essence.**

And enjoying the journey I say to myself: **Someday I will be able to bring this to the real world?** It's not easy but not impossible.

***“I think each of us has a Shepard in us.”*** Bigger or smaller, but we do.

I am not saying that we are all world-changing leaders.

I am talking about everyday situations, where we can mediate, stop an injustice or **sow goodness.**

***“We need more people in the world to bring out our Shepard.”*** **And you, are you up for it?**

It doesn't have to be something big. **Small steps and consistency** are the key to success.

Who knows? Maybe someday, I'll play Mass Effect again and I won't feel like Shepard is a **fictional mentor** anymore.

He is **a comrade in arms** who has served as an example to me.

*“This story is not just about Mass Effect.”*

*“It's about remembering who we really are when no one is looking.”*

*“And maybe, just maybe, becoming someone worth following”*

I hope you have enjoyed this little reflection I have shared with you. And remember: we can always be better. Have a good evening.

Ad blockers, those silent gatekeepers of an “uninterrupted” browsing experience, have become the invisible wrecking ball to journalism and content creation. They promise users a cleaner web, free of flashing banners and autoplay videos.

Consider this: advertising underpins nearly 90% of online content. Without it, most of what we consume—from breaking news to quirky YouTube videos—wouldn’t exist. A 2023 report by PageFair estimated that ad blockers cost publishers over $35 billion annually in lost revenue. That’s not just numbers; it’s real people—journalists, editors, photographers—losing their jobs, their platforms, their voices.  

And here’s the irony: many of the people using ad blockers are the ones who value journalism and creativity the most. They’re discerning readers who want quality content but don’t realize that blocking ads is like walking into a coffee shop every day, enjoying the ambiance, but never buying a cup of coffee.  

Sure, ads can be annoying—no one loves being interrupted by a pop-up about car insurance while reading an investigative piece on climate change. But what if we reimagined this relationship? What if instead of blocking ads entirely, we found ways to make them less intrusive and more meaningful?  

There are tools out there—like (Turn Off the Lights) or (Dark Reader) —that improve the browsing experience without disrupting the ecosystem that keeps content alive. But these tools weren’t built to address journalism’s existential crisis. They make the web easier on the eyes but don’t tackle its biggest challenge: balancing user experience with sustainable funding models for creators and journalists alike.  

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Journalism isn’t just about reporting facts; it’s about holding power to account, amplifying marginalized voices, and fostering understanding in an increasingly divided world. Content creators aren’t just entertainers; they’re storytellers who bring joy, knowledge, and connection to millions. Together, they form the backbone of our digital public square—a place where ideas are shared, debated, and celebrated.  

So next time you open an article or watch a video you love, think about what made it possible. Behind every headline is a journalist working late into the night; behind every video is a creator hustling to make ends meet.

1js8nvw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1js8nvw,Cup One tuning help,"Picked up a Craigslist Cup One for my office, but doing some tuning at home over the weekend.  The owner claims that her husband did not want it and that they only ran hot water through it.  Here are the details:

Grinder: KitchenAid KCG0702ER Burr Grinder. For the second cup (shown), I went 2 clicks (out of 15) more course than what we use on our KBGV.

Ratio: Filled water to the line (presumably 10oz or 300ml) and weighed 17g of grounds.  Coffee was still slowly dripping well after 10 minutes and was getting cold before I could safely remove the cup.

Filter: Moccamaster #1. I placed with no special consideration for the first cup.  For the second cup, I neatly folded the seam (side and bottom).

I heard concerns about the tiny opening. I could see light coming through but barely.  Upon closer inspection with a loupe, it appears quite rough. Has anyone else seen this?  Or does this look like the previous owner tried to ream the hole?

1js8msy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/1js8msy/the_zoo_experiment_with_neither_infinite_monkeys/,The Zoo Experiment with Neither Infinite Monkeys nor Keyboards,"The driver behind evolutionary change is mutation. Genes foul up in replicating, the theory goes, and the result is a slight tweak on life. Add up enough tweaks, millions upon millions, and look! an amoeba has become an orangutan

Most mutations, though, are bad news. And so, natural selection emerges as the determinant of which ones die out and which ones are preserved, to be passed on to the next generation. Only a beneficial mutation is preserved, since only that variety gives one an advantage in the ""fight for survival.""

Gene replication is amazingly accurate. ""Typically, mistakes are made at a rate of only 1 in every ten billion bases incorporated,"" states the textbook Microbiology. (Tortora, Funke, Case, 2004, pg 217) That's not many, and, remember, only the tiniest fraction of those mutations are said to be any good.

Since gene mutations rarely happen, and almost all that do are neutral or negative, and thus not enshrined by natural selection, a student might reasonably wonder if he is not being sold a bill of goods by evolutionists. Natural selection may work, but so does the law of entropy. Doesn’t natural selection just select the least damaging option? Can “benevolent” mutations possibly account for all they are said to account for?

Enter Thomas Huxley, a 19th-century scientist who supported Charles Darwin's theories of evolution. Huxley came up with the pithy slogan: ""If you give an infinite number of monkeys and infinite number of typewriters, \[What are THOSE?...update to keyboards\] one of them will eventually come up with the complete works of Shakespeare."" Surely the great unwashed can understand that!

Nevertheless, his assertion had never been tested. Until 22 years ago, that is. Evolutionists at England's Plymouth University rounded up six monkeys, supplied them with a computer, placed them on display at Paighton Zoo, and then hid behind trees and trash cans, with notebooks, breathlessly awaiting what would happen! They were disappointed. Four weeks produced page after page of mostly s's. Not a single word emerged. Not even a two-letter word. Not even a one letter word. Researcher Mike Phillips gave details.

At first, he said, “the lead male got a stone and started bashing the hell out of it.” Then, “Another thing they were interested in was in defecating and urinating all over the keyboard,” added Phillips, who runs the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technologies.

They didn't write any Shakespeare! They shit all over the computer!

Alright, alright, so it wasn't a real science experiment. It was more pop art. And they didn't have an infinite number of monkey or computers. Even science must yield to budgetary constraints. Surely, if you had a infinite number, groused the guardians of evolution, then you would end up with Shakespeare.

Hm. Well, maybe. But wouldn't you also need an infinite number of shovels to dig through an infinite pile of you know what?

University and zoo personnel defended their monkeys. Clearly, they didn't want them held responsible for sabotaging science. Geoff Cox, from the university, pointed out that ""the monkeys aren't reducible to a random process. They get bored and they shit on the keyboard rather than type."" And Vicky Melfi, a biologist at Paignton zoo, added ""they are very intentional, deliberate and very dexterous, so they do want to interact with stuff you give them,"" she said. ""They would sit on the computer and some of the younger ones would press the keys."" Ultimately the monkeys may have fallen victim to the distractions which plague many budding novelists.

It's true. I often get distracted working on my book and when that happens I will sometimes . . . pour myself another cup of coffee.",0,1743873929.0,DebateEvolution,7,0.29,False
1js8ltd,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1js8ltd/how_i_ascended_from_being_a_lifelong_involuntary/,How I ascended from being a lifelong involuntary NEET by curing my depression and ADHD with a raw diet!,"(I hope this can inspire depressed people, whom I was a part of, to try a different approach in life, and see if it will help them, just like it saved me)

My entire life I ate mostly grains, because I was relying on organic portal parents who did not have a best interest in mind for me, but in fact the worst intention. It gave me biochemical depression, I layed on the bed in front of a computer for over 10 hours during daytime every day, because I had no energy and motivation, which is chronic fatigue, which is depression, for my entire life, and for many years after finishing school. (Plant based diet also destroyed my looks, hormones, and health, but this is not the topic here, except for the fact that if I had a girlfriend in this worthless lookist world, her existence would have motivated me even under biochemical depression like plenty of people report experiencing and living normal good lives). 

Over 6 months ago I discovered information about a carnivore diet and also a raw diet. 

At the exact same time I became diabetic from certain other malicious people from being coerced to take drugs and eat a vegan diet, experiencing rapid atherosclerosis everywhere (and forever continuing If I continued eating any carbohydrates). Atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) from diabetes can spread unlimitedly when consuming carbohydrates but not having enough insulin response, and a person could die from a stroke or heart attack soon enough, while ageing rapidly before the death. 

When I announced I am diabetic and asked for a diet / food of mostly fat trimmings and a little bit of chicken, which I specifically chose as cheapest items I could find, I was denied by my malicious parents, saying I must continue eating grains, and they will not give me money to eat this diet. 

Around that time, I was given even less care, and had to eat only grains and legumes, no animal products at all. 

I got access to some money, which is rare, it was not my money. 

I spent that money to buy and eat only raw chicken thighs (fatty), with ketchup (raw meat is tasteless, just like grains), and raw eggs, for an entire one month (that was how long it would have lasted, I calculated it). I did this because I was afraid of injuring myself on a future job if I started immediately after being a vegan for several months, because I had severe arthritis gout and weakness of joints and even bones, from eating grains, alongside heart defect and severe heart pains almost like micro heart attacks, from the same reason plus the reason of coffee which was of course freely given to me daily for years by the organic portals, they paid for poison but never paid for what I needed for health. And, I wanted to see if I will actually gain energy and motivation, within some weeks. 

I wanted to start looking for jobs after the month of healing and eating was done and there was no food anymore. I wanted to literally starve myself while looking for a job, to motivate me extra, because I was unsure if only one month of a raw diet would be enough to cure my depression, and because I would not have gotten any more money to avoid grains in the future, no more meat will be there after that time, and I wanted to change my life finally. It decided to either fly or die. 

After a month, this is what happened.

As I expected, my body became less weak, I no longer felt vulnerable to injuries, the science and logic of a raw diet proved to be correct, raw nutrients cured my crumbling skeleton and painful heart, partially, after this month, and I gained confidence that even if I will have to pick the worst physical job, I could do it for some months at least, and change my life from having savings and work experience and any slightly nicer job opportunities. 

My food was running out. I got up, decisively, closed all distractions, and I tried to search for jobs and call companies. It went easy, without any mental block. 

Previously in my life, I made over several thousand plans about the day and the life, and I accomplished absolutely 0 things in all of them. (I also developed many project ideas, and journaling of thoughts about the world, plans I did alongside since I felt like writing something and had time and wanted to change my life). 

I quickly went to interviews, and did all the talking. I got rejected the first time, and I just went applying again feeling alright, and did a trial period, and found a few gigs. Now I had nothing stopping me, everything became effortless, I found myself having discipline I never had. 

My biochemical depression was cured after a month of raw animal foods completely. 

(If you are curious for an explanation, the raw animal foods diet cured my brain and strength because plants don't contain over 15 micro nutrients (all fat soluble vitamins, certain B vitamins, essential amino acids), and because cooked animal foods do not contain significant amounts of water soluble vitamins (cooking destroys all of them) and half the amount of minerals, while making you absorb entirety of toxins from animal medications in them. Eating raw meat and raw eggs gives you every micronutrient, and it gives you them in maximal amount, and this is what is needed for curing by rebuilding your malnourished tissues, better production of hormones (especially raw fat's nutrients), and your brain and organs are composed of micro nutrients, the better the nutrition, the better they function). 

The job market was harsh to me. I went to a big grocery store chain, three different locations. Fem\*hits did not hire me, or hired someone else after trial period, or fired me, just because of my looks. At that point, I was 2 months into eating raw meat and raw eggs, and felt my body was stronger than ever before. I found myself in a situation where my fulltime job opportunities have rejected me, and my gigs were over because they found their part timer attractive girl and had no need in a subhuman gigger anymore, I had nothing, except understanding that fem\*hits will fire me as a subhuman from okayish jobs, and possessing my new body, and so I decided to research warehouse jobs. 

I had a very strong negative outlook on warehouse jobs, including from hearing a story from a NEET who got a spinal disk injury from working in an Amazon warehouse job, but I tried to overcome the negativity, I researched information, and what people told about them and the company (similar to Amazon) on the internet. It helped me to overcome my feelings, and my biochemical discipline pushed me to download the app for application and work, and just like that, I went there with the bus, and gone through documents, and got the job, quickly. 

Immediately I realized I was earning double the amount I was earning as a subhuman gig worker and trial period worker, and slightly above average compared to other types of unqualified jobs in the city. I was lucky, it was a good job, with a good pay, and okay bearable tasks. I immediately stopped eating chicken which is white meat, and started eating raw fatty red meat, which is raw pork, it contains more minerals and more vitamins and more of the saturated fat which is of utmost importance in nutrition. It gave me more energy and good recovery from exertive physical job of the warehouse, after a day of rest, on a 1:1 schedule, with eating raw fatty red meat, my spine was always healed, and I felt capable of doing the job. 

Now, I am employed in the warehouse job for over 4 months, and having eaten the raw diet for over 5 months. 

My biochemical depression never returned, I am always completely ready to go and work my shifts of 14 hours for 15 days per month. I started self improving in my freetime, and now do some regular routines, like lymphatic baths for detox, skincare with masks of raw sour cream for entire day, and microfracturing (even though I am in mid twenties now, raw red meat does give me cartilage growth and shrinkage, because it works). 

My arthritis is no more strong, my joints do not crack casually anymore. My micro heart attacks stopped completely, I have no heart pain. 

Employment is helpful and gives me enough money to eat a lot of red meat or a lot of eggs every single day, it gives me savings, it gives me options to do things in life. 

I am soon to use my savings and buy the consultation and then my first surgery to fix my teeth which are completely deformed from a grain based diet, my face will look more normal and I will find a virginal girlfriend. 

I also have enough income to eventually improve myself in various directions, like buying courses and even education. 



I improved a lot in these months, I became a different person, I'm proud and loving of my new freedom to buy and having good things in life I earned, I want to improve even more, and live a nice life being educated and loved. 

If you want to try a raw diet, here is my recommendation. Watch the Aajonus Vonderplanitz' workshop of 3 episodes on Youtube. Every day, try to swallow some raw eggs on an empty stomach, and some chopped up cubes of raw fatty red meat or chicken by swallowing with sips of water after chewing a few times. Every day, try to close all distractions, and look for a job and education, and one day you will find yourself capable to do more and more steps towards the goal, I know from experience. I wish you to improve and achieve what you want the most in life.

He used to be a “heavier” drinker, he lived steps away from a bar, would go down there whenever someone asks him to, especially to socialize but he cannot control his drinking. He would go Sundays every week, Mondays 90% and drink at home on Saturdays. We started dating and long story short, he only drink Saturdays (when he play video games with his “boys”) and if his best friend is in town, he goes Sundays. 

I came from a family who never drink, so I don’t know if this is normal or not but I still thinking drinking heavily every saturdays is too much. I still need his presence and weekend is the only time we get to spend together without worrying about having something to do like going to work. He calls it his “calm down” time.

 Anyway, he decided to drink last night because his friends are playing a new game on Xbox. He woke up this morning trying to touch me, I knew this was gonna happen, he was randomly touching my face which got me very annoyed so I told him whatever he is trying to do, I don’t want it, then he tried to push my face turn it so he can kiss me. 

God that was so annoying, I told him I am not a toy he cannot just move me around. He turned to the other side acting upset. Then he was laughing on something on his phone and turned to me smiling expecting me to ask him what was it. But I wasn’t interested in all of this, the ups and downs, be “funny” one moment and upset the next moment. 

He got up and asked me if I want coffee trying to make it better, I got up to make mine and we hang out in the living room. He mentioned something sexual and I said it’s not happening, we won’t have s** the day of and the day after he drinks. He said but it makes me last longer I said it’s fine, I would prefer that. He said I don’t know how to please you. Hahah excuse me? I think he knows very well but it is impossible for him to drink in moderation or stop all together, it’s not about pleasing me. 

He sat down after that acting upset and I knew the next moment would be him mentioning something funny and we would go back to the emotional rollercoaster. So I just picked up my coffee cup and came back to bed. And just a side note: this man can go up to a month or more without having s** with me, I have to remind him (by arguing) how long it has been for him to realize, because most of the time I come to him telling him how much I want him and every time he says no or not today or I have a raid (he plays World of Warcraft ) but even before the game, he just refuses. So there is no way now that I am gonna allow s** just because alcohol makes him horny. 

He says he gets horny multiple times a day but he is busy playing his video games or his IBS would be acting up and if he moves a lot he would sh** his pants. Seriously?! What am I dealing with, what kind of a man go this long without being intimate with the person he loves?!

1js8hra,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1js8hra/aita_for_feeling_hurt/,AITA for feeling hurt?,"Good afternoon everyone,

First and foremost, my girlfriend (F28) and I (M27) have been dating for a year, we are dating from distance, even though it is quite a bit more complex (I live with her, but spend half the month working in another city, sleeping those days at my job, as it is a professional requirement). We are planning on moving together for good in July.

Now, onwards to the issue at hand. Last year my girlfriend and I got together for the first time on the 6th of February, and since we weren't dating or mutual, having just gone through a ONS of sorts, on the 9th of February she engaged in sexual activities with this guy we'll call C (who she later on admitted to having caught feelings for in the past, back in 2023).

As February and March went by, we started growing closer, though C was always trying to get closer to her (though they haven't shared any moments apart from a coffee here and there until early June. I respected her defense of their relationship as, even though they were no longer going at it, they were still friends.

Fast forward to May (and us having begun dating in early April), my girlfriend decided, during an argument, to side with him in a difference of opinion, clearly stating in some way that his opinion was clearly as, if not more, important than mine, having scheduled a coffee with him, while being completely aware he was still trying to get back to her. As a response, I pretended to send a message to an ex of mine, took a print and unsent, showing her that I could also just set up a coffee with an ex who supposedly could still be a friend, as some sort of revenge. This backfired and we had a huge fight (I do take the blame for this one, I could have handled the situation way better than I did, but I had already told her plenty of times I didn't feel comfortable with her staying in touch with an ex that clearly still hasn't gotten over her).

Well, we did patch things over, she supposedly learned to respect that boundary and ended up understanding that she was, in fact, hurting me, since I considered it disrespectful (I had no contact with any exes of mine or ex FWB, not that I wanted, but still, never even considered it, it is too disrespectful, way I see it).

Come March, she noticed I had some leftover comments on instagram in one of my ex's pictures from 5 years ago (to be completely honest, I had no idea they existed). I went through lengths to comfort her and reassure her that I would never, in any way, do anything to hurt her the same way I did in May.

Fast forward a couple weeks (2 weeks ago), the girl that I had used to make her understand my point in May, sent me a message out of the blue... I instantly showed it to my girlfriend and told her 'look, I dont really want to reply, dont feel like it has anything to add to my life' and told her she could just reply whatever she wanted, to make her feel better, so she did (she was not rude or anything, she just said she wasn't interested in talking indirectly).

And then comes yesterday... C decided to text her about something (even though related to her work, he had been at her workplace a couple months ago trying to hit on her), and she thinks she should reply, and wants to, just to figure out how he found out about something he shouldn't know about (she does have other ways of figuring out).

Is it normal that I feel hurt that, even though he keeps hitting on her, she feels like it's okay to feed him attention just to figure out how he found out about this work thing?

I am well aware this might come out as a very small and shallow issue, compares to most things posted here. Also aware of how long the post is, let myself go in providing context.

Last year I made a post about having tried thirty different burgers from across LA County.  I had been in and out of the hospital for a period of about six months prior to that, with my last visit lasting about a month all by itself and including one stretch of about ten days where I didn’t eat any food at all and only sipped on water and juice.   
  
In spite of having no appetite, I found myself passing a good amount of time those days by looking up various food-related things online, including burgers.  So when I got out and got through the initial shaky period of recovery, I went to work on going to try some of these things I had been reading about.  
  
At thirty burgers, I felt like I’d done some things and seen some stuff, so, after finding this subreddit, I made that post.  
  
And then, in the comments, u/tommyrockum replied to leave the following blog post he had made about trying 100 different burgers in LA County over several years.  This was the Burger Quest:  
  
[https://trueadventurestories.com/2023/09/07/burger-quest/](https://trueadventurestories.com/2023/09/07/burger-quest/)  
  
It was impressive.  And it gave me a new goal: I wanted to complete my own Burger Quest of 100 LA County burgers.  And, being a bit singular minded in my interests at times, that is what I’ve been spending the last year accomplishing.  Today, I would like to share my results, my own ranking of what ended up being 135 burgers from, if I counted correctly, 117 different places.  This has been an unusual undertaking, the kind of thing I wouldn’t have imagined doing prior to when I started doing it, but it was and has been a much needed bit of fun.  It absolutely gave me something to look forward to and enjoy as I came through a particularly bleak time in my life.  
  
Why 135, you may ask?  Why not 150?  Or 200, for that matter?  Simply enough, because that’s the number I landed on after getting to all of the places I had marked down to try, and having the burgers I was most curious about.  I could have kept it going until I hit a more pleasingly round number, but the truth is, I’ve realized that a Burger Quest is never really over.  What might I have done at 200?  Declared that I was done having any other different burgers in LA ever, so as not to disrupt that nice, even number?  In fact, as I type this, there are a small number of places featured on the list that I’d still like to go back to at some point to try another burger or two from their menus.  So let’s say that this is my Burger Quest for now, and it may still change in the future.  
  
My initial thinking when I made the post about the first thirty was much the same as tommycockum’s, and reading his post helped focus my approach.  The places here are not big chain restaurants, or fast food chains.  These places had to be particular to LA County.  Generally speaking, a handful of locations was fine to me, and one or two of them being outside of LA or even California was alright as well as long as it appeared to me that the place was mostly LA-based.  It wasn’t an exact science, but it made sense enough to me.  For example, the last time I looked at Irv’s website, I think I saw that they have a single location in Las Vegas.  I was okay with that, and to still count them.  On the other hand, a place like Houston’s in Pasadena, with only one location out of many being in LA County, and with several locations across the country, was ineligible.  I did get out to a number of such chain places while doing this, and perhaps I’ll make a follow up post about some of those another time.   
  
Furthermore, if a place had a self-titled burger, then I had to try it.  If there was another burger on the menu that caught my eye then I could get that too, but I had to try the burger named for the establishment itself.  On this list as it currently stands, no establishment has more than two entries…with the single exception of Amboy, which has a comparatively large five.  It’s possible that I missed some place’s self-titled burger somewhere in here, but I think I mostly achieved the goal.  If an establishment had no self-titled burger, then I was free to pick what most called to me.  
  
As I continued with the Burger Quest, my initial five tier system expanded and developed a bit from how I originally framed it.  The burgers here are ordered by tier, and ranked within those tiers as well, with an explanation of what each tier now signifies at its top.  
  
My thought on what would constitute a successful achieving of the Burger Quest developed as well.  I had initially thought just 100 burgers would be it, but as I approached that number, I realized that since I’d gotten more than one burger from some places, if I stopped at 100 then I would have fewer than 100 different places that I’d gone to, and that felt incomplete.  I spoke to tommyrockum about that, and he was in agreement: 100 *places* was key.  If you look at his blog, you’ll notice that he also made sure to get to 100 different places.  After reaching that, I kept going until I’d been everywhere I had made a note of.  I ended up trying some of these burgers more than once (for example, several of those that had been on my initial list of thirty), to make sure that I had a good feel for them.  As a result, some have risen or fallen since their original placement.  
  
tommyrockum and I actually did meet up on two occasions along the way to try some burgers, first at Oui Melrose, and second at a Yellow Paper Burger popup (before they opened their brick and mortar location).  A fond memory for me is that, at Oui Melrose, we were evidently interesting enough in our in-depth discussion of burger preferences that a couple at a nearby table politely interrupted us to get in on the conversation.  
  
I was planning to do some writeups for some of these in this initial post, but between what I’ve typed already and the list itself, this is already going to be a huge wall of text.  So instead, I will put some writeups and notes in the comments below for anyone who is curious.  I will, however, address two specific items here.  
  
First, the Jazz Burger from Jitlada.  In the same way that I wouldn’t call a loco moco a burger, I just don’t know if I would call the Jazz Burger a burger.  So it is not ranked here.  But it is still *really* damn good, and if I were including it, it would be a Tier 1 entry for me.  For my purposes here, I’ll call it the list’s only Honorable Mention, and a very honorable one at that.   
  
**And I should also address the overall number one burger in all of Los Angeles County by my estimation, the burger from Dunsmoor.**  Why is Dunsmoor’s offering at the top of the list?  It's not just that it’s decadently juicy, or that it’s bursting with flavor, or an excellent balance of all of its top-notch ingredients (which seem to change on occasion—the first time I had this burger, it came with a slice of tomato on top, and the second time it did not).  This is a burger that leaves me with the feeling of eating pancakes: I want to lick the damn plate when I’m finished with it.  If not for the fact that I was eating it in public, I probably would have.  It’s *that* good.  
  
Some of these placements will seem strange to some people who may read this.  I have some popular, trendy burgers lower than you might expect.  My own ranking is only my own: if a favorite of yours is low, don’t understand that to mean that I am criticizing your taste, only that mine may not be the same.  And I do have to repeat one line from tommyrockum’s post that stood out to me when I first read it: “Go eat a hundred burgers. Then let’s talk.”  
  
This has all been done for love of burgers, and I hope that if you’ve gotten through my long-winded leadup here then you enjoy having a look at the list!

No exposés on corruption, no deep dives into the lives of the unheard, no sharp-witted columns that make you laugh and cry in equal measure. Imagine opening your favorite news site and finding… nothing. Just a blank page where the voices of journalists and creators once lived.  

This isn’t some dystopian fantasy—it’s a quiet storm brewing beneath our digital lives. The culprit? Ad blockers.  

Ad blockers, those silent gatekeepers of an “uninterrupted” browsing experience, have become the invisible wrecking ball to journalism and content creation. They promise users a cleaner web, free of flashing banners and autoplay videos. But they also strip away the lifeblood of the very people who make the internet worth visiting: journalists and creators.  

Every time an ad is blocked, it’s not just a pop-up that disappears—it’s a paycheck for a reporter who spent weeks investigating a story. It’s funding for a photographer capturing moments that define our times. It’s the livelihood of creators who pour their hearts into making content that informs, entertains, and connects us.  

Consider this: advertising underpins nearly 90% of online content. Without it, most of what we consume—from breaking news to quirky YouTube videos—wouldn’t exist. A 2023 report by PageFair estimated that ad blockers cost publishers over $35 billion annually in lost revenue. That’s not just numbers; it’s real people—journalists, editors, photographers—losing their jobs, their platforms, their voices.  

And here’s the irony: many of the people using ad blockers are the ones who value journalism and creativity the most. They’re discerning readers who want quality content but don’t realize that blocking ads is like walking into a coffee shop every day, enjoying the ambiance, but never buying a cup of coffee.  

Sure, ads can be annoying—no one loves being interrupted by a pop-up about car insurance while reading an investigative piece on climate change. But what if we reimagined this relationship? What if instead of blocking ads entirely, we found ways to make them less intrusive and more meaningful?  

There are tools out there—like (Turn Off the Lights) or (Dark Reader) —that improve the browsing experience without disrupting the ecosystem that keeps content alive. But these tools weren’t built to address journalism’s existential crisis. They make the web easier on the eyes but don’t tackle its biggest challenge: balancing user experience with sustainable funding models for creators and journalists alike.  

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Journalism isn’t just about reporting facts; it’s about holding power to account, amplifying marginalized voices, and fostering understanding in an increasingly divided world. Content creators aren’t just entertainers; they’re storytellers who bring joy, knowledge, and connection to millions. Together, they form the backbone of our digital public square—a place where ideas are shared, debated, and celebrated.  

So next time you open an article or watch a video you love, think about what made it possible. Behind every headline is a journalist working late into the night; behind every video is a creator hustling to make ends meet. They matter—not just to themselves but to all of us who rely on their work to stay informed and inspired.

Ad blockers may promise convenience, but they come at a cost we can no longer afford: silence where there should be stories.

Sunday morning, Tuesday night, whenever I feel like treating you right. Loving hands whenever I’m near you and a little smooch even on your shoulder as I pass by. Fresh flowers on the table and plants fill the rooms, the cozy decor giving you a home. I’m gentle and sweet, snuggles in your sleep, messy hair in the morning but a big smile on my face. Good morning my love. Every day. Our home, our bed, our dinner at our place. My art next to your shelf becomes our home. 

I wear the dress you bought me with the shoes you picked out, my hair the way you like it. Natural blush, a little mascara, my freckles prominent because I sit outside on our balcony you remade for us. And that sparkling ring on my finger, my favorite thing to wear, not just my favorite accessory because of how much I care. Our symbol of love uniting us, making me your wife to everyone who asks. But not even asking, a glance is enough to spot me as yours from across. My darling, how cute I would look. In your oversized shirt at the end of the night with your big slippers on my little feet as I waddle in through the balcony door with the glass in my hand, the cocktail you mixed me after a long day at work. You wear your favorite pajama I washed last minute because I knew you’d need the comfort after the stress you had this minute and your hair is messy as you look for your glasses that I find on the sideboard after I cleaned them for you. You wash our dishes, I cuddle our dogs. Our scents mix and give our home a new one, is it my name or yours on the doorbell out front?

Wouldn’t I look cute behind you on your motorcycle for the rest of our lives, on the right side of your bed, on the chair next to you and the hand in your hand? Wouldn’t I look cute as your last relationship, your safe space and retreat when life gets too much. Wouldn’t it be cute to say “I miss my wife” when you’re out with others to come home to me. 

Belonging to you in a sense without question. Married. Your wife. Yours to care for, eternally. Wouldn’t I look cute in your arms every day knowing we chose this fate? Wouldn’t I look cute in our bathroom, my makeup scattered next to your razor? How cute would our keys look together in that dish and our toothbrushes in the same cup. I’d look cute as a wife.

I know a few reasons why my 1st cb experiment failed. I accidentally bought ground beans for starters. I like Starbucks bottled, refrigerated (NOT concentrate) cold brew and if that means I have bad taste the so be it lol.

Starbucks Columbia medium roast (ground 👎) which has ""notes of toasted walnut & herbs"" which maybe is why it feels ""spicy"" in my mouth. Even adding additional heavy whipping cream and Toranis is just not doing it for me.

I posted a few weeks ago about a Takeya I thrifted and the comments didn't have me very excited to try it. And then I found a Presto Dorothy rapid cold brew gadget at the thrift right next to a Mr. Coffee bean grinder new in box. 

Last night I started with the Presto device, let it spin for like 15 min (is this a gimmick and how TF does that thing work? Genuinely feel stupid asking but it's cray to me). Then I started having second thoughts and shut it down and used the thing that's essentially a French press (with suction—idk if all French presses have a rubber ring around the press?)which is where using course ground beans probably matters here. What a mess. That's when I panicked because it was the color of iced tea—so I dumped it into the Takeya filter and let it sit in the fridge overnight. 

Is my disappointment coming from the bean flavor itself, or my haphazard first attempt and over-brewing? I think people who truly enjoy the taste of coffee would say I did good. If I add water to my concoction, it is slightly more palatable—so, I guess I made a concentrate. But still I find the taste to be ""spicy""/overwhelming. Tastes like I drank the end of the pot of Folgers at my parents house lol. ",2,1743873155.0,coldbrew,1,1.0,False

Then I would get hit with noise, light, and smell sensitivity, general malaise, and headache, usually just on one side by not always. I normally chug some electrolytes, make myself a coffee, take a Tylenol (can’t take ibuprofen), and go lie down in the dark with my frozen migraine cap. It isn’t perfect but it helps. 

Last weekend I got a migraine again and since I recently received a prescription for rizatriptan, I took three doses over the course of 48-ish hours. I didn’t exceed 2 doses in 24 hours. It helped, but I found myself extremely depressed in postdrome. Way more than usual. 

Then yesterday (almost a week after my last migraine), I started having to pee a lot, but no blurred vision or other usual prodrome/aura symptoms. But then my right arm went numb and tingly. It almost felt like it fell asleep. The I got hit like a truck with fatigue. I went to lay down and my arm stayed numb all night. I then also got hit with light sensitivity and general malaise. When I finally tried to sleep, the headache hit me. I didn’t sleep very well because of the pain, which has never happened to me before. Today the pain is minor, but I still feel really unwell. Very tired, my body aches, my arm still feels tingly, and the weirdest symptom is that my head feels like it has goosebumps! It comes and goes but it feels so bizarre!!! I didn’t take my triptan because I don’t want to overdo it and I don’t want to make my depressive symptoms worse but oh my god… this is so strange! I read about hemiplegic migraines but I was able to lift my right arm and move it normally, it just felt like it was asleep/almost like it wasn’t really attached to me.

Not sure if this classified as a stupid question, but I figured it’d be a fun one to ask since I am experiencing this right now and would like some advice. 

I met a woman who’s 25F and we hit it off really well. However, she said she was a DoTERRA sales rep but I didn’t think much of it since my mom used to do Avon back in the day so I’m familiar with these MLM things. 

However, this woman is OBSESSED with DoTERRA. I walked into her place and was immediately met with a DoTERRA spray freshener that automatically sprays the oil. Then I go into her room and she has a massive rack of DoTERRA. I was honestly impressed because there were so many oils. She then says she uses DoTERRA cleaners to clean her house instead of bleach and things that normal people use, uses DoTERRA peppermint beadlets to “wake her up” instead of coffee, only uses DoTERRA oils and lozenges when she’s sick instead of medicine, and she’ll use DoTERRA washing detergent for her clothes. 

This woman basically lives and breathes DoTERRA and it’s kind of concerning. Whenever I have an issue, it’s always, “I have an oil for that”. Even if I’m stressed and want to talk, she’ll be open to talking but then suggest an oil that’ll calm my nerves. She’ll also jokingly suggest that I refer her to my mom and sisters if they need any oils since she’d make commission. 

I’m not sure how to feel about it so I was wondering if you all would be okay if your partner was obsessed with MLM type companies (Avon, DoTERRA, etc.). ",1,1743872796.0,u_Connect_Bathroom_257,0,1.0,False

After a full day of calculation, I get just 45- 50 grams of protein on average. My goal weight is 60kg, and even by that measure, I should be getting around 100 grams of protein at least right? Below is my general day of eating, please take a look and tell me if there's any way I can make things water.

Breakfat : Cofee ( 250ml skimmed milk + 6gram coffee powder + 12g sugar ) Approx 130 Cals

Lunch: 2 Roti ( 40-45 g each ) + 250 g curd + 50g raw onion ( as salad ) + 250 g Pulses or Veggie.

Ok, if it's green veggie like bottle gourd, summer squash, or something, then total meal calories fall somewhere between 550-600 Cals.

If it's pulses day, it could be kidney beans, chole, and many types of lentils. Total calls can be around 750-800, depending on specific prep.

If it's potatoes, capsicum, veggie, or something, then somewhere around 650 calories.

You get the gist, whatever is cooked, I am taking 250g only. Curd is also fixed at 250g, and Roti are also always 2 40-45 gram each.

If someday there's white rice, I take 100g ram rice, and 1 roti instead of 2.

On average, lunch is between 600-800 calls

Evening Snack: Sometimes an 80- 90 gram Banana, or some biscuits or namkeen or almonds. Apprix 200-300cals on avg.

Dinner: 1 roti, 1 spoon curd (30- 40 grams), and 80-100 grams of whatever veggie/pulses I had in noon. Dinner, I keep it light, and try to keep it to 350 calls max.

Ok, so that's what a typical day is and this ofcourse gives me lots of carbs, but protein is only making 15-20% of meal on avg as per Lose it !!

So, can you please help me? Am I doing badly? Please tell me what I can do to get more protein. I am losing weight and doing some 8-9k steps as well, but I don't want to be protein deficient. As a vegetarian, it's really hard to escape the carb trap, Please suggest.

I'm in a class with this girl, and for the first few months we didn't talk too much, I thought she was cute, but didn't really try to connect. A few weeks back (we had an upcoming presentation) I reached out asking if she wanted to be in a group with me and another person. She said yes, and so we started practicing together (in the group of 3).

Three weeks ago we started spring break, and this girl and I started DMing. Vibes were light, flirty and fun. I started to like her, and looked forward to texting her.

Fast forward to a week ago, we hungout at a kickback with friends, and texted each other to get home safe. I felt really good.

I'm good friends with one of her friends, so I texted them to see if she was seeing anyone, they told me she wasn't, and wasn't looking to date atm. I was kinda bummed about that, but our convo was still going really well. A day after that, the friend told me that she mentioned me in conversation, and asked if I had a girlfriend.

A few days ago, we had our first presentation, and it went really well. Vibes were still awesome. A day later, I asked her if she wanted to get dinner sometime, and she responded saying that she would be happy to, and suggested getting dinner in our presentation group (the group of 3).

This made me pretty upset, so I talked to my friend about it and they said that because we were still in the presentation group, she didn't want it to be awkward if we went on a date and it didn't go well, and this made sense to me. They said that I should've waited a little bit later until our presentation was done to ask her out.

But then a day later, (yesterday) the same friend said that I have like a small chance of getting a date with her, and now I'm just like damn.

It sucks because things were going so well, and then I escalated and now its awkward. The friend two days ago said that she didn't want it to be awkward between us, and then yesterday said that there's a small chance a date could happen.

I'm upset with myself for asking her out ""too soon"", because we're still in the presentation group, but from my perspective I had all the signals from her to ask her out.

What should I do? I definitely overthink relationship stuff, but this one just sucks because everything was going great and in the span of a few days its like its all gone downhill.

I thought there was attraction there, but with the way things are going now, I'm not sure. I still would like to setup a date, and I'm gonna give her a lot of space over the next week to think, and then I'm planning on trying to hangout or get coffee (something a little less formal than dinner, since I think she was kinda taken aback by me asking her out like that).

On the morning of June 9, 1940, Dame Sibyl Hathaway looked across her island and saw the horizon obscured by billows of black smoke.

Twenty-five miles east, on the coast of France, oil storage tanks spewed flames. Weeks earlier, the Wehrmacht had penetrated the Maginot line, the bulwark of trenches and fortifications separating France from Germany. Now, as the occupation of France looked inevitable, the people of Normandy were sabotaging their own oil reserves.

For Dame Sibyl, it was a private smoke signal. If Normandy fell, Sark would follow. (She knew the Germans would be hungry to occupy the Channel Islands; it was a chance to sow propaganda about controlling ""British"" territory.) As rumors swirled about evacuations, Dame Sibyl took the ferry to Guernsey to see how the second biggest Channel Island was preparing.

The air was thick with panic. There were lines everywhere: Lines at stores as people frantically bought suitcases, lines at the bank as people attempted to withdraw money, lines at the dock as people pushed onto boats bound for England. Possessed by the chaos, islanders buried heirlooms in their gardens. Hundreds of expectant evacuees swarmed the veterinary clinic in an attempt to put their beloved pets to sleep.

The Channel Islands, the dame soon learned, would be demilitarized—they weren't even going to put up a fight. In just one week, approximately 17,000 people would evacuate Guernsey alone. The commotion appalled Dame Sibyl so deeply that, on the trip back to Sark, she ""made up my mind how best I could protect my own people.""

Dame Sibyl worried that Sark could crumble if too many people evacuated the island. The gist of feudalism, after all, is that it’s self-sufficient: If everybody on Sark stuck together, the dame reasoned, life could go on.

Shortly after returning from Guernsey, she called a meeting and told the inhabitants that she had decided to stay—and asked the islanders to remain as well.

""I am not promising you that it will be easy,"" she told them. ""We may be hungry but we will always have our cattle and crops, our gardens, a few pigs, our sheep and rabbits.""

The dame understood that not everybody might sign on and promised to arrange for anybody’s departure, if they so wished.

Of those born on Sark, not one person left.

##The Nazis Arrive

Just one week after the Channel Islands were officially demilitarized, three German military planes barreled over Sark, hurtled toward Guernsey, and bombed that island's capital of St. Peter Port. Thirty-eight civilians died. Dame Sibyl watched as the planes arced over the channel and aimed for her home. Bullets pelted Sark's harbors, but nobody was hurt.

The following day, the telephone line connecting Sark and Guernsey fell silent. Three days after that, on July 3, 1940, a lifeboat arrived at Sark's main harbor. The Germans had arrived—and the dame made her first move in a subtle game of political one-upmanship.

Sark's coastline is forbidding. In the Middle Ages, pirates and privateers would circle the island's bluffs looking for a place to dock, only to declare it unreachable. Today, visitors can be carried up a steep lane by a tractor-pulled wagon affectionately named the ""Toast Rack."" In Dame Sibyl's day, horses lugged the passengers up. But not on the day the Nazis arrived. Dame Sibyl resolved that she would not go to meet the Germans; they would come to her—and they would walk.

As the Nazi officers hiked, Dame Sibyl waited in her royal residence, a stone mansion known as La Seigneurie, and talked strategy with her husband, Bob. ""Let's take a leaf out of Mussolini’s book,"" she told him. They placed two chairs behind a desk at the far end of the drawing room, which would force the officers to walk the whole length of the room. It was a small power move, but they needed every trick they could muster. The dame advised her maid to announce the Germans as if they were any other villager.

Dame Sibyl later wrote in her autobiography, The Dame of Sark, that she was ""determined that this island, at least, should show a front of firmness and dignity and give the impression that we were taking everything in our stride in the firm conviction that we would make the best of a bad time which we were convinced would not endure long.""

When the Germans arrived, the officers wiped their boots on the doormat outside. Dame Sibyl glanced at her husband with relief. Just from the sound of their feet, she could tell that the men about to enter her house were aristocrats—the way they wiped their boots was a sign of respect.

As luck would have it, the Channel Islands attracted a disproportionate number of Germany's uniformed aristocrats. The islands were a relatively safe spot for Germany's most privileged soldiers, who were naturally attracted to staying in a bygone place where inheritance still equaled influence. ""That the German nobles would have felt a particular affinity with a place where pre-modern feudal rule was still partially intact is an inescapable conclusion,"" Paul Sanders wrote in *The British Channel Islands Under German Occupation*.

This arrangement, however, would play into Dame Sibyl’s hands.

The maid announced the men's arrival. Two officers, draped in dark green, introduced themselves and told Dame Sibyl that they had come to establish some rules. There would be a curfew at 11 p.m.; no groups larger than five were allowed in the streets; all pubs were to be closed; all arms were to be confiscated; and no boats were allowed to leave the harbor.

Hearing this, Dame Sibyl nodded: ""Bitte hinsetzen,"" she said, asking them to sit. She continued speaking in German: ""I will see that these orders are obeyed.""

There was a moment of stunned silence. The German officers, dumbfounded by the dame’s command of their language, were immediately flustered.

""You do not appear to be in the least afraid,"" one officer said.

Without hesitation, Dame Sibyl replied tartly, ""Is there any reason why I should be afraid of German officers?""

##Resisting with Decorum

The dame's complete control over the happenings in Sark wasn't her only power over the Germans. Her name was in the *Almanach de Gotha*, a German directory that listed all of Europe’s most important royals and nobility—a who's who of the continent's aristocrats.

""She was aristocratic and came to understand that the Germans in command were also aristocratic,"" Sark's current seigneur, Christopher Beaumont, told Mental Floss. ""They connected on that level. And it would allow conversations to go on that probably couldn't have happened had their statuses been different.""

From her opening interaction, Dame Sibyl immediately realized that any fantasies about armed insurrection would be useless. Rather, her greatest weapon would be decorum. For the rest of the war, she put on an air of exceedingly stuffy social graces. She would never approach a German, but expect him to approach her. Before allowing a Nazi to take a seat in her home, she reportedly demanded that he bow and kiss her hand.

As she'd later write in The Dame of Sark, ""The stiff German formality worked in my favor because it showed the Germans that I expected to be treated in my home with the rigid etiquette to which they were accustomed in their own country."" These social conventions successfully eroded her new visitors' confidence and gave her the upper hand when they began mulling policies that threatened her people's lives.

At first, Dame Sibyl found small ways to get under the occupiers' skin. In her sitting room, she deliberately placed anti-fascist books at eye-level. Sometimes she'd innocently ask the soldiers why they were taking so long to conquer Russia. She regularly fired shots at the Nazi sense of ethnic superiority with backhanded compliments. (When she learned that the Germans had bought all the tweed in Guernsey and were planning to ship it to Britain for tailoring, she told them: ""No one can deny that English and Scotch tweeds are the best in the world ... or that London tailors are vastly superior to those in any other country."")

Dame Sibyl knew that, in aristocratic circles, the artifice of polite conversation meant everything—and her words could work like a psychological water torture experiment. Each little statement was harmless alone, but over the course of weeks and months, these constant drops of rhetorical acid helped her assert dominance and compelled many German officers to drop their guard. As she'd write, ""In the course of polite conversation I was often able to acquire useful information which would not otherwise have been available.""

Sark's residents followed the dame's lead. When the Germans tried to implement a bureaucracy that threatened the island’s feudal self-sufficiency—demanding that fishermen only go out to sea from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., accompanied by an armed guard—they responded with their own subtle shows of disrespect. Sometimes fishermen ""forgot"" to appear at the docks during the approved fishing times, leaving their German chaperones waiting alone at the harbor. Other times, fishermen deliberately steered into giant swells, soaking the landlubbing Nazis and making them seasick. Even the children played tricks, stringing invisible wires across the road to trip Germans riding bicycles.

But war, of course, is more than a game of pranks. All of Sark's radios would eventually be confiscated, leaving most residents clueless as to what was happening off the island. Dame Sibyl, for instance, had a hazy idea that the Luftwaffe were bombing London, but she didn't know about the bombings in Bristol, Birmingham, or Belfast.

She also didn't know that her eldest son, Buster, was long dead—killed during the blitz of Liverpool.

##""Who is your superior?""

By summer 1941, as more enemy troops moved onto the Channel Islands, the Germans started hoarding a disproportionate amount of the island's produce. Sark's islanders began to suffer. The Sarkese began making ""tobacco"" from dried clover and fruit leaves; ""tea"" with dried peapods steeped in hot water; ""coffee"" with grated barley, dried sugar beet, and parsnips. Every meal included lobster. ""When lobster is the main dish day after day, month in month out, let me assure you that you become heartily sick of the sight of it,"" Dame Sibyl wrote.

The dame fought these restrictions with a healthy dose of do-you-know-who-I-am? To get what she wanted, she schmoozed with the aristocratic officers: Colonel Graf von Schmettow, commander-in-chief of the Channel Islands, who was friends with Germany's exiled Kaiser; Freiherr von Aufsess, the chief of civil administration, who was indirectly connected to the dame through a marriage of cousins; Prince Oettingen, the kommandant of civil administration, who shared mutual friends with the dame back in Germany. Whenever troops on Sark gave Dame Sibyl gruff, she simply went over their heads to these ""friends.""

""If the lower classes made any attempt to bully me or my people I knew full well that neither they nor I would show any sign of cringing,"" she wrote. She was able to end a handful of disputes by simply asking: ""Who is your superior?""

""Because the social conventions were so strong, she was treated with much more deference than we would get treated with now,"" Seigneur Beaumont said.

Weaponizing etiquette truly had its charms. When Schmettow’s son died on the Russian front, Dame Sibyl sent him a sympathy card, a gesture Schmettow never forgot. So later, when Sark risked being slapped with steeper rations, Schmettow fought the cuts on the dame's behalf. And when Sark's German doctor was murdered by a fellow German soldier, the dame's relationship with Prince Oettingen ensured that the island received a replacement immediately. ""She essentially used social protocol to broker deals,"" Beaumont said.

Some policies, however, were beyond Dame Sibyl’s control. ""Natural factors limit the number of people who can live on Sark,"" Beaumont said. ""If we've got close to 1000 people here, we could start running out of water."" In October 1941, 300 German soldiers were sent to the island, putting a significant strain on its resources.

Things got worse as the war heated up. The following year, British commandos raided Sark, killing two German officers and taking one prisoner. The Germans retaliated, placing barbed wire around Sark's perimeter and laying more than 13,000 landmines, which made it impossible for the islanders to launch their fishing boats, collect the gorse they needed for fuel, or gather seaweed they used for fertilizing fields. Soon, rabbits discovered that the minefields were a great place to breed—and the island's crops were decimated by the ensuing bunny boom.

Then Germany decided to deport all of Sark's British citizens.

According to some accounts, Dame Sibyl convinced the Germans that most of Sark's people were, in fact, not British, but Channel Islanders. This little game of semantics appears to have worked: Of the 400 islanders, the list of deportees was reduced to just 11 people.

In February 1943, a more indiscriminate round of deportations was ordered by the Nazi brass in Berlin. Two additional roundups targeted 50 people, including Dame Sibyl’s husband Bob, an American citizen, who was sent to a prison camp in Bavaria. (Bob maintained his resistance in prison: He smoked a pipe during the daily parade; stood at ease when he was called to attention; and snuck secret doses of liquor.)

It's difficult to quantify how well Dame Sibyl’s networking had helped in reducing the number of deportations. We do know, however, that Prince Oettingen, who considered the dame a friend, was so outspoken in his opposition to the deportations that he was eventually removed from his post.

Now alone, Dame Sibyl doubled down on her attempts to make the occupiers feel like incompetent fools. One of the most amusing stories occurred during the spring of 1943. At the time, Sark's Guernsey cattle were still producing half a pint of milk per head, which the island's farmers secretly skimmed before handing over to the Germans. When the Germans complained to Dame Sibyl that they couldn't make butter with the milk, she showed up to their headquarters dressed in traditional butter-churning overalls and proceeded to give such a confusing and patronizing lecture on the art of butter-making that they were too embarrassed to ever complain again.

For the rest of the war, the Germans were left scratching their heads in bewilderment as they tried making butter from skim milk.

##""More forceful than any army officer and more than equal to any German kommandant""

In the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, Dame Sibyl groggily woke to the rumble of bombers flying overhead and the thundering of heavy guns off the French coast. Later that morning, as she drank a cup of what could euphemistically be called coffee, the island's German doctor visited and, in hushed tones, told her that the Allies had invaded Normandy.

All the ships and planes had bypassed the Channel Islands.

As Allied troops pressed into France, island life turned bleak. Winston Churchill refused to send any food to the Channel Islands, insisting that Germany was responsible for providing sustenance to lands it occupied. But the Germans didn't provide for the people of Sark—the people of Sark provided for the Germans. Feudalism, the dame learned, didn't work smoothly when hundreds of moochers were hoarding all the provisions.

Indeed, by winter, even the Germans were feeling pinched. Chickens, pigs, cats, and dogs started disappearing. The Germans demanded that all of Sark's stored grain, plus 90 percent of all potatoes, be funneled into their coffers.

For the dame, this crossed a line. Instead of complying, she helped launch a clandestine operation to steal back what was, according to feudal law, rightfully hers. One evening, as the Germans were preoccupied with their dinner, the dame and a crew of conspirators stole a half-ton of wheat from the village hall, which they hid in her barn. Meanwhile, they secretly hoarded potatoes under a trap door in her drawing room. The loot was secretly distributed in to residents in rations.

The months crawled until Hitler finally died. On May 8, 1945, the commanding Germans demanded that Dame Sibyl hand over Sark's cattle and 200 tons of timber for fuel. Instead, she flew the British and American flags from her tower and joined the islanders as they lit a bonfire in celebration.

By this point, there were 275 German soldiers stationed on Sark, but after the arrival—and departure—of the British liberation team, Dame Sibyl had become their commander. As she began giving orders, a British officer observed that she acted ""more forceful than any army officer and more than equal to any German kommandant.""

First, the dame demanded they establish a telephone line connecting her house to Guernsey. Then she ordered the Germans to return all the confiscated wireless radios and to remove all 13,500 landmines. She insisted that each prisoner repeat her commands and relished hearing the soldiers say ""Zu Befehl, Gnädige Frau"" (""At your command, madam"").

Over the coming months, German POWs completed a series of construction projects, building a protected concrete path over a narrow isthmus connecting the southern half of the island; repairing and redecorating the homes they had occupied; and resurfacing the island's roads. They also removed rusty roll-bombs dangling from wires over Sark's harbors.

One day, Dame Sibyl received a call from Sark's ex-kommandant informing her that one of those bombs had exploded. Two German prisoners were killed.

In that moment, the courtly facade of manners the dame had maintained so firmly for five years finally crumbled. She said what was exactly on her mind.

""Ach, so?""

So far, I've lost almost 3kg.  But I am really concerned about my protein intake. After a full day of calculation, I get just 45- 50 grams of protein on average. My goal weight is 60kg, and even by that measure, I should be getting around 100 grams of protein at least right? Below is my general day of eating, please take a look and tell me if there's any way I can make things water.  


Breakfat : Cofee ( 250ml skimmed milk + 6gram coffee powder + 12g sugar ) Approx  130 Cals

Lunch: 2 Roti ( 40-45 g each ) + 250 g curd + 50g raw onion ( as salad ) + 250 g Pulses or Veggie. 

Ok, if it's green veggie like bottle gourd, summer squash, or something, then total meal calories fall somewhere between 550-600 Cals.

If it's pulses day, it could be kidney beans, chole, and many types of lentils. Total calls can be around 750-800, depending on specific prep.

If it's potatoes, capsicum, veggie, or something, then somewhere around 650 calories. 

You get the gist, whatever is cooked, I am taking 250g only. Curd is also fixed at 250g, and Roti are also always 2 40-45 gram each. 

If someday there's white rice, I take 100g ram rice, and 1 roti instead of 2. 

  
On average, lunch is between 600-800 calls

Evening Snack: Sometimes an 80- 90 gram Banana, or some biscuits or namkeen or almonds. Apprix 200-300cals on avg.

Dinner: 1 roti, 1 spoon curd (30- 40 grams), and 80-100 grams of whatever veggie/pulses I had in noon. Dinner, I keep it light, and try to keep it to 350 calls max. 

  
Ok, so that's what a typical day is and this ofcourse gives me lots of carbs, but protein is only making 15-20% of meal on avg as per Lose it !!

So, can you please help me? Am I doing badly? Please tell me what I can do to get more protein. I am losing weight and doing some 8-9k steps as well, but I don't want to be protein deficient. As a vegetarian, it's really hard to escape the carb trap, Please suggest.

1js80ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1js80ee/witching_tea_party_invitation_april_12th/,Witching Tea Party Invitation - April 12th,"A little hop and a while ago, I suggested doing a community tea party. Y'all REALLY liked that idea! So, we're about a week out, and I'll make something a little more official.

**Who**: Any practitioner, new or experienced, and/or respectful observer is invited.   
  
**What**: A little online even to get Reddit's practitioners together to discuss spellcasting, goals, ask questions, and be an all-around social for attendees. 

**When**: April 12th - We're going to begin at 12 AM EST. However, since so many people wanted to participate yet had time zone issues, I'm just gonna make an anchor post and we'll consider 12 AM EST the START of the party. We'll continue for 24 hours for whoever wants to drop in and participate. So-- Officially running from April 12th, 12 AM EST to April 13th, 12 AM EST.

**Where**: Right here, on the witchcraft subreddit. I'll make an anchor thread on the day of the paaarty, you just turn up to the thread and refresh the page periodically!

**Why**: To get us together, just to have a little community affair while we shoot the breeze, do our casts, and hang out. You don't have to cast if you don't want to, but some of us will be. And if you're casting, you don't have to talk about the specifics but you are welcome. Whatever you feel comfy sharing. 

**How**: You can 'tea party' however you'd like. Tea, water, coffee, slushee, whatever you drink. Snacks are good. Pick some flowers for the mood, if you want. Altar, kitchen table, outdoor porch, any location you are pick is totally good.

**Recommended Prep Work**: A couple nights prior I'm going to do an overall 'keep it safe, keep it clean' cleansing (my specialty is in protection, I work with it regularly and see frequent success with my work). And you can do whatever you like, of course, we're a community not a coven so we don't have lasting bonds. We just talking. In short, it's a very, very safe event. However, if you want to be super-extra-special safe, I recommend that you guys do your own personal environmental cleansing and protection casts/wards on all attendees (including familiars) some time pre-event. Might also be a good excuse to pick up new candles, incense, or even reagents if you've been looking for a reason. 

**Rules**: Obviously we're abiding by the rules of the subreddit. No soliciting spellwork for money (you can post your physical goods shops though!), no politics, nothing harmful, etc... Everything on that list goes. Additionally, I'd like to add my own thing-- Please no requesting energy for spells from others in this particular event. It is 100% encouraged to ask questions and answer them, but please keep all divisive energy requests as their own stand-alone posts. There's a huge difference between 'wish me luck' and 'hey how about you use your spellwork to cast with me on this date for this reason'. Please save the latter for its own post/private communication.

...

Now, some of you requested that this be done monthly, or to open a Discord/Zoom for it. We're probably not going to do Zoom at all-- It's not a bad idea, but since we have varying timezones in such a diverse group, we're going to run for a full day-night cycle. Little difficult to do that on a video call, and I'm not sure I could host for a full 24 on a call either.   
  
Discord might come later. This is literally the very first time we'll be doing this, so I'd like to gauge reception before we diversify our platforms. Plus, it's a Reddit community, it's just nice to have it on Reddit! In short, we'll see how it goes and go from there!

I’m feeling like shit because, like the tile says, I accidentally might’ve scared the barista at my local cafe. 

This happened this evening. 

I went to my local cafe to get a coffee to go. I walked in and noticed the barista cleaning up as it was just about closing time. She seemed friendly and was smiling. She took my order and I got to making some odd small talk.

As it was towards the end of their day, I said something along the lines of, “so it’s just you at the moment closing up”. She kinda paused and said no, and that there was “someone else in the kitchen”. Her demeanour sort of changed. I thanked her, took my coffee and was on my way. 

I realised a good while after I left, that what I said could’ve come across as predatory and now I feel extremely horrible. I can’t even go back to apologise, because they closed at 5pm. 

So if you’re on Reddit, barista lady, and you happened to come across this post please know I profusely apologies for what I said and how it might’ve come across. I am aware of about all the shit women go through on a day to day basis and I sincerely hope you understand, that was not at all my intentions with that statement. 

So that’s my Saturday r/edinburgh. How’s your Saturday going?

These cards - even to new players are extremely dumb.

The fact that boss encounters are balanced around them also throws a wrench into the smoothness of gameplay. Even if they were DEAD SET of having such a confusing addition, there absolutely should have been an option to play without them, and have the encounters balanced around that. These are like a bonus ""for fun"" mode that this game did not need.

I’m not bragging or whatever you want to accuse me of doing. I’m just stating a fact. My life still looks good. I have a good job, a home, I’m healthy. So what’s the problem?

My therapist is trying to frame me for murder.

Last night I was doing my regular jog around the neighborhood when I got a call from Pete. When I answered the phone, Pete went into beast mode.

“Annie, you should have never messed with me,” he said. I could feel the anger in his voice like slaps on my face. “Why did you do it?  I will never forgive you. You better watch your back.”

Pete is my colleague from my marketing job. I’m not his office wife or whatever, just a colleague. We are the heads of two different teams. Is there competition? In his head maybe. OK, we work for the same company, and sure, we are all happy with each other’s successes but there’s also the bonus thing. Whoever manages a better marketing campaign for their respective client, they get all kinds of perks including a cash bonus.

I work on non-fiction book marketing campaigns and so does Pete. Is he competitive? That’s what everyone says. I don’t really pay much attention to that kind of stuff. They call me bulldozer Annie. So honest that people get angry, so indifferent to everyone’s ill intentions I don’t feel a thing. Like a bulldozer demolishing buildings without a second thought and not giving a damn.

I don’t care. But now here I am, standing at my apartment’s front door.

My running clothes from last night? They are rolled up in the laundry basket still covered in mud and blood. The clothes I’m wearing now are clean and I’m office-ready. Muscle memory must have taken over.  All I can remember is standing in that park near my house in the torrential rain staring at Pete’s dead body.

And that wasn’t even the weirdest part.

At work everyone acts normal. Pete isn’t here of course. But no one seems to care? I don’t know. He wasn’t that unlikable. Why isn’t anyone saying anything? I’m not going to ask about him. That would be incriminating if they ever do find his body, right?

I’m going to grab a coffee. Maybe I’ll overhear someone talking about Pete or maybe someone will come asking, eager to gossip or whatever it is they do in the break room.

I got another flash of what happened last night as I took a sip of coffee earlier. I don’t think I had anything to do with Pete’s murder but I absolutely buried him. Maybe buried isn’t the right word. Pete is definitely well-hidden.

No one has come asking about anything. Not even why Pete didn’t show up at work. I’m on my way to see my therapist. I’m sure that man has something to do with all this. No. Scratch that. I know my therapist is trying to frame me for Pete’s murder. I just don’t know why or how he did it.

In about 7 months, I have an exam that will basically decide my future. There’s *a lot* of material I need to memorize, and right now I’m studying around 5–6 hours a day, aiming to gradually push that up to 10 hours daily.

Energy-wise I’m doing fine (thanks to plenty of coffee), but my biggest issue is **focus**. I often catch myself reading without actually absorbing the information—my mind just drifts off, and I struggle to maintain concentration for long periods , i think i also have some kind of brain fog.

Also, I’ve become pretty **sedentary** lately since I barely have time for anything besides eating, studying, and going to university.

As for supplements, I’m currently taking Omega-3, Vitamin D + K2, Finasteride 1mg, oral Minoxidil 2.5mg daily, and Magnesium Bisglycinate before sleep.

Is there anything else I could add to improve focus and support sustained mental effort? And is there something stronger or more effective that I could take just in the final month as an extra boost?

Thanks a lot!",5,1743872055.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

I’m into movies, theater, dancing, singing loudly, reading, hosting dinner parties, laughing too loud, and champagne for breakfast.  
I love hearts, pink, and white; fashion and traveling; and I could spend every day happily sitting in a bookstore café, sipping on a chai tea latte, and reading a book or working on my laptop. Wanna guess what color I chose for my MacBook?

Currently we use a nespresso machine at home (I know). This is certainly not the best cup of coffee we drink but it suffices. For those times when we have more time, we use an electric or hand grinder to make a nice cup of pour-over.

I have been orienting myself for some time for when the nespresso machine breaks down and is beyond repair (already 7 years old). Since I also enjoy the whole pour-over process I want to try my hand at espresso.

Is the H10A worth it for 169 euros? Combined with my Encore ESP grinder, I think I have a reasonably budget-friendly setup that will make a pretty decent espresso.

1js7t19,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1js7t19/how_i_ascended_from_being_an_involuntary_neet/,How I ascended from being an involuntary NEET,"(I hope this can inspire other involuntary NEETs to try a different approach in life and see if it will help them to live how they want to live)

My entire life I ate mostly grains, because I was relying on organic portal parents who did not have a best interest in mind for me, but in fact the worst intention. It gave me biochemical depression, I layed on the bed in front of a computer for over 10 hours during daytime every day, because I had no energy and motivation, which is chronic fatigue, which is depression, for my entire life, and for many years after finishing school. (Plant based diet also destroyed my looks, hormones, and health, but this is not the topic here, except for the fact that if I had a girlfriend in this worthless lookist world, her existence would have motivated me even under biochemical depression like plenty of people report experiencing and living normal good lives). 

Over 6 months ago I discovered information about a carnivore diet and also a raw diet. 

At the exact same time I became diabetic from certain other malicious people from being coerced to take drugs and eat a vegan diet, experiencing rapid atherosclerosis everywhere (and forever continuing If I continued eating any carbohydrates). Atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) from diabetes can spread unlimitedly when consuming carbohydrates but not having enough insulin response, and a person could die from a stroke or heart attack soon enough, while ageing rapidly before the death. 

When I announced I am diabetic and asked for a diet / food of mostly fat trimmings and a little bit of chicken, which I specifically chose as cheapest items I could find, I was denied by my malicious parents, saying I must continue eating grains, and they will not give me money to eat this diet. 

Around that time, I was given even less care, and had to eat only grains and legumes, no animal products at all. 

I got access to some money, which is rare, it was not my money. 

I spent that money to buy and eat only raw chicken thighs (fatty), with ketchup (raw meat is tasteless, just like grains), and raw eggs, for an entire one month (that was how long it would have lasted, I calculated it). I did this because I was afraid of injuring myself on a future job if I started immediately after being a vegan for several months, because I had severe arthritis gout and weakness of joints and even bones, from eating grains, alongside heart defect and severe heart pains almost like micro heart attacks, from the same reason plus the reason of coffee which was of course freely given to me daily for years by the organic portals, they paid for poison but never paid for what I needed for health. And, I wanted to see if I will actually gain energy and motivation, within some weeks. 

I wanted to start looking for jobs after the month of healing and eating was done and there was no food anymore. I wanted to literally starve myself while looking for a job, to motivate me extra, because I was unsure if only one month of a raw diet would be enough to cure my depression, and because I would not have gotten any more money to avoid grains in the future, no more meat will be there after that time, and I wanted to change my life finally. It decided to either fly or die. 

After a month, this is what happened.

As I expected, my body became less weak, I no longer felt vulnerable to injuries, the science and logic of a raw diet proved to be correct, raw nutrients cured my crumbling skeleton and painful heart, partially, after this month, and I gained confidence that even if I will have to pick the worst physical job, I could do it for some months at least, and change my life from having savings and work experience and any slightly nicer job opportunities. 

My food was running out. I got up, decisively, closed all distractions, and I tried to search for jobs and call companies. It went easy, without any mental block. 

Previously in my life, I made over several thousand plans about the day and the life, and I accomplished absolutely 0 things in all of them. (I also developed many project ideas, and journaling of thoughts about the world, plans I did alongside since I felt like writing something and had time and wanted to change my life). 

I quickly went to interviews, and did all the talking. I got rejected the first time, and I just went applying again feeling alright, and did a trial period, and found a few gigs. Now I had nothing stopping me, everything became effortless, I found myself having discipline I never had. 

My biochemical depression was cured after a month of raw animal foods completely. 

(If you are curious for an explanation, the raw animal foods diet cured my brain and strength because plants don't contain over 15 micro nutrients (all fat soluble vitamins, certain B vitamins, essential amino acids), and because cooked animal foods do not contain significant amounts of water soluble vitamins (cooking destroys all of them) and half the amount of minerals, while making you absorb entirety of toxins from animal medications in them. Eating raw meat and raw eggs gives you every micronutrient, and it gives you them in maximal amount, and this is what is needed for curing by rebuilding your malnourished tissues, better production of hormones (especially raw fat's nutrients), and your brain and organs are composed of micro nutrients, the better the nutrition, the better they function). 

The job market was harsh to me. I went to a big grocery store chain, three different locations. Fem\*hits did not hire me, or hired someone else after trial period, or fired me, just because of my looks. At that point, I was 2 months into eating raw meat and raw eggs, and felt my body was stronger than ever before. I found myself in a situation where my fulltime job opportunities have rejected me, and my gigs were over because they found their part timer attractive girl and had no need in a subhuman gigger anymore, I had nothing, except understanding that fem\*hits will fire me as a subhuman from okayish jobs, and possessing my new body, and so I decided to research warehouse jobs. 

I had a very strong negative outlook on warehouse jobs, including from hearing a story from a NEET who got a spinal disk injury from working in an Amazon warehouse job, but I tried to overcome the negativity, I researched information, and what people told about them and the company (similar to Amazon) on the internet. It helped me to overcome my feelings, and my biochemical discipline pushed me to download the app for application and work, and just like that, I went there with the bus, and gone through documents, and got the job, quickly. 

Immediately I realized I was earning double the amount I was earning as a subhuman gig worker and trial period worker, and slightly above average compared to other types of unqualified jobs in the city. I was lucky, it was a good job, with a good pay, and okay bearable tasks. I immediately stopped eating chicken which is white meat, and started eating raw fatty red meat, which is raw pork, it contains more minerals and more vitamins and more of the saturated fat which is of utmost importance in nutrition. It gave me more energy and good recovery from exertive physical job of the warehouse, after a day of rest, on a 1:1 schedule, with eating raw fatty red meat, my spine was always healed, and I felt capable of doing the job. 

Now, I am employed in the warehouse job for over 4 months, and having eaten the raw diet for over 5 months. 

My biochemical depression never returned, I am always completely ready to go and work my shifts of 14 hours for 15 days per month. I started self improving in my freetime, and now do some regular routines, like lymphatic baths for detox, skincare with masks of raw sour cream for entire day, and microfracturing (even though I am in mid twenties now, raw red meat does give me cartilage growth and shrinkage, because it works). 

My arthritis is no more strong, my joints do not crack casually anymore. My micro heart attacks stopped completely, I have no heart pain. 

Employment is helpful and gives me enough money to eat a lot of red meat or a lot of eggs every single day, it gives me savings, it gives me options to do things in life. 

I am soon to use my savings and buy the consultation and then my first surgery to fix my teeth which are completely deformed from a grain based diet, my face will look more normal and I will find a virginal girlfriend. 

I also have enough income to eventually improve myself in various directions, like buying courses and even education. 



I improved a lot in these months, I became a different person, I'm proud and loving of my new freedom to buy and having good things in life I earned, I want to improve even more, and live a nice life being educated and loved. 

If you want to try a raw diet, here is my recommendation. Watch the Aajonus Vonderplanitz' workshop of 3 episodes on Youtube. Every day, try to swallow some raw eggs on an empty stomach, and some chopped up cubes of raw fatty red meat or chicken by swallowing with sips of water after chewing a few times. Every day, try to close all distractions, and look for a job and education, and one day you will find yourself capable to do more and more steps towards the goal, I know from experience. I wish you to improve and achieve what you want the most in life.

Hey MaximizeMe crew! 🙌 Who here gets nailed by that daily energy slump like clockwork? You know, when your brain feels like it’s running on dial-up and all you want to do is faceplant into your desk? Yep, been there, done that, got the souvenir mug. ☕️

But hang on, before you dive into another cup of coffee and end up jittery as a squirrel at a rave, let me share my secret weapon—a 10-minute ritual that's been my energy game-changer!

### **Why 10 Minutes?**
Because *ain’t nobody got time* for complicated routines. You want quick, effective, and totally doable, right? Here’s the magic spell that zaps me back to life:

1. **Breath Break** 🧘‍♀️  
   Seriously. Just. Breathe. Sounds too simple? Maybe. But taking deep breaths for 2 minutes switches your brain from panic mode to Zen master level. Try it: in through the nose, hold, out slow. Repeat.

2. **Dance It Out** 💃  
   Yes, dance like nobody’s watching—even if your co-worker is peeking over their cubicle. Blast your favorite track and move! My go-to? Old school 90s jams. Instant mood lift.

3. **Nature (or Fake It)** 🌿  
   If possible, step outside, even if it's just to stare at a tree. No plants around? No problem! I have a desk plant I chat with. Don’t judge; it works. 😅

4. **Write It Out** ✍️  
   Spend 2 minutes jotting down whatever’s cluttering your mind. To-do lists, random thoughts, or even your taco cravings. Get it out, clear your mental inbox.

5. **Quick Stretch** 🧘‍♂️  
   Channel your inner cat—stretch it out. Arms, back, neck—you name it. Awaken those muscles and feel the difference instantly.

### **Surprising Result?**
I expected mild improvement, maybe just enough to get by until dinner, but instead? It’s like flipping my mental light switch—clarity, focus, *and* a better mood. 🥳 Who knew 10 minutes could do so much?

So, who’s ready to shake off that slump and try something new? I promise, it's more effective (and cheaper) than a mid-afternoon latte! What's your mini-ritual to recharge? Let's hear it! 🌟",1,1743871734.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1js7ptu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mrescober/comments/1js7ptu/the_ultimate_guide_to_buying_perfume_online_tips/,"The Ultimate Guide to Buying Perfume Online: Tips, Platforms, and Safety","Shopping for perfume has never been easier, thanks to the growing trend of [buying fragrances online](https://scentxpress.com/). From hard-to-find niche scents to popular designer brands, the internet offers a world of choices right at your fingertips. Forget the hassle of visiting multiple stores or dealing with pushy salespeople—now you can explore endless options, compare prices, and read reviews all from the comfort of home. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to make smart, safe, and satisfying online perfume purchases.

# Why Choose to Buy Perfume Online?

Buying perfume online has become a preferred choice for many shoppers, and it’s easy to see why. With the rise of e-commerce, purchasing your favorite fragrances is now simpler, faster, and often more rewarding than going to a physical store. Let’s break down why shopping for perfume online is a smart and practical decision.

# Convenience of Online Shopping

Life is already busy enough without adding trips to the mall or specialty boutiques to your to-do list. Shopping for perfume online allows you to browse at your own pace, no matter where you are or what time it is. Whether you're sipping coffee on your sofa or taking a quick break at work, the online shopping experience is designed to fit seamlessly into your schedule.

There’s also no need to deal with crowded stores, long lines, or pushy salespeople. With just a few clicks or taps, you can explore countless options and place your order stress-free. The perfume comes directly to your door—no need to leave the house.

# Wider Selection Available

One of the biggest perks of shopping for perfume online is the **unmatched variety** it offers. Physical stores are limited by shelf space, but the internet has no such restriction. Online retailers often carry everything from the classics you love to niche and hard-to-find scents that aren’t available locally.

Want to try the latest fragrance release from a top designer? Or maybe you’ve been searching for a discontinued scent you can’t find in stores? Chances are, you’ll find exactly what you’re looking for online. Many e-commerce platforms even let you filter by brand, scent family, or price, making it easier to pinpoint your perfect match.

# Access to Exclusive Deals and Offers

Shopping for perfume online doesn’t just save you time—it can also save you money. Many online retailers offer exclusive discounts, flash sales, and **special bundles** you won’t find in traditional stores. Plus, it’s easy to compare prices across different websites to make sure you’re getting the best deal.

From free shipping on select orders to seasonal promotions, these savings add up quickly. You might even discover perks like free samples or rewards programs, which give you even more value for your purchase. The best part? Many of these deals run year-round, so there’s always an opportunity to save.

# Customer Reviews and Ratings for Decision Making

If you've ever struggled to decide whether a perfume is worth buying, online reviews are your lifeline. These **honest opinions** from other buyers can tell you everything you need to know, from how the fragrance smells to how long it lasts. Think of it like getting advice from a friend who's already tried the product.

Ratings provide a quick overview of a perfume's popularity, while detailed reviews often highlight insights you wouldn’t get from a product description alone—like how a scent evolves throughout the day or whether it’s suitable for certain occasions. This transparency helps you feel confident about your purchase, even if you haven't smelled the perfume in person.

# How to Choose the Right Perfume Online

Shopping for perfume online can feel tricky when you can’t sample the scent in person. But with the right approach, you can confidently find a fragrance that matches your personal style, preferences, and even the moment you’re shopping for. Let’s break it down step by step.

# Understanding Fragrance Families

Every fragrance belongs to a specific “family” or category of scents. Knowing which family appeals to you is a foundation for choosing the right perfume. Here’s a quick guide to the main fragrance categories and what they’re known for:

* **Floral**: Think fresh-cut flowers like roses, jasmine, or peonies. These are perfect if you love soft, feminine, or romantic scents.
* **Woody**: Rich, earthy tones such as sandalwood, cedar, and vetiver. These tend to feel warm, grounded, and a bit sophisticated.
* **Oriental**: Exotic and bold, with ingredients like amber, spices, and vanilla. If you enjoy mysterious, sultry scents, this family is for you.
* **Fresh**: Bright and clean scents that include citrus, aquatic, or green notes. These are lively and perfect for an energetic or casual vibe.

Ask yourself: Do you prefer sweet and flowery, or something deeper and spicier? Understanding fragrance families helps you filter your options while shopping online.

# Researching Perfume Notes and Longevity

In perfume descriptions, you’ll often see mentions of top, middle, and base notes—these are the layers of a fragrance. Learning about them can help you predict how a scent will develop throughout the day.

* **Top Notes**: These are the initial scents you smell right after application. They’re usually light and fade quickly (think citrus or fruity aromas).
* **Middle Notes**: Also called the “heart,” these emerge after the top notes dissipate. They’re often florals or spices and form the core identity of the perfume.
* **Base Notes**: The notes that remain the longest on your skin. These are often musky, woody, or creamy smells that add depth and staying power.

When browsing online, look for descriptions of the note structure. If you’re someone who prefers perfumes that linger all day, make sure to check for mentions of fragrance longevity or concentration (e.g., Eau de Parfum typically lasts longer than Eau de Toilette). Reviews can also provide insights into how long a specific scent stays noticeable.

# Testing Perfumes Without a Physical Sample

Not being able to smell a perfume before buying can feel like a gamble, but there are tools and tricks to make it easier.

1. **Take a Scent Preference Quiz**: Many perfume retailers offer quizzes asking about your favorite smells, lifestyle, or even emotional preferences. These suggest scents tailored to your likes.
2. **Order Sample Sets**: Some brands or online shops sell mini sample kits or discovery sets. These let you try multiple scents without committing to a full-size bottle.
3. **Read Reviews**: Look for comments from people who share your taste in scents. A quick search for ""similar to \[your favorite perfume\]"" can guide you to other fragrances you might like.

Think of these tools as your digital “test sniff.” While it’s not the same as a store experience, it’s a smart way to narrow down your choices.

# Considering Seasonal and Occasion-Based Perfumes

The perfume you wear can say a lot about the mood or moment you’re in. When shopping online, consider where and when you plan to use your new fragrance.

*  

Tailoring your fragrance to your lifestyle and occasions enhances how it complements you. A versatile perfume might work in multiple settings, but don’t be afraid to explore different scents for specific moments.

By breaking down your preferences and using these strategies, choosing the right perfume online can be not just easy, but enjoyable.

When it comes to buying perfumes online, choosing a trustworthy platform is essential. With so many websites vying for your attention, it’s important to know where to shop for authentic fragrances. Below, we’ve outlined some of the most reliable options, each with its own unique benefits and considerations to make your shopping experience seamless and stress-free.

# Dedicated Perfume Retailers

Specialty perfume retailers are often the first choice for those in search of genuine fragrances. These websites focus exclusively on perfumes, offering extensive collections and a commitment to authenticity.

* **FragranceX**: Known for its huge inventory, FragranceX caters to everyone from designer fragrance lovers to niche scent seekers. Their competitive prices and frequent discounts make them a favorite among shoppers. Plus, they clearly state the concentration and packaging details, so you know what you’re getting.
* **Perfume.com**: This site is an excellent starting point for fragrance lovers. They offer popular brands and hard-to-find scents, along with a hassle-free return policy. Their detailed product descriptions, including fragrance notes and customer reviews, help buyers make informed decisions.
* **FragranceNet**: Another well-regarded retailer, FragranceNet often provides additional savings through promo codes. They stock a wide range of authentic fragrances for both men and women and have bundles and sampler sets that are perfect if you want to try multiple scents.

These platforms operate with a focus on catering specifically to perfume buyers, offering authenticity guarantees and competitive pricing. Shopping with them ensures a reliable and straightforward experience.

# Department Stores and Luxury Retailers

The online storefronts of major department stores and luxury retailers are trusted spots for high-end fragrance purchases. Not only do they carry premium brands, but they usually have exclusive offerings you won’t see elsewhere.

* **Nordstrom**: Renowned for its curated collection of designer perfumes, Nordstrom’s online store is a treasure trove for luxury fragrance fans. They often offer free shipping and a generous return policy, making it easy to shop with confidence.
* **Macy’s**: Macy’s online store excels at providing a mix of popular perfumes and classic favorites. They frequently bundle fragrances with gift sets, making them a go-to for special occasions. Plus, their regular sales events allow you to snag high-quality scents at a discount.
* **Sephora**: For those who love variety, Sephora delivers with an incredible range of perfumes across all price points. They’re also known for their detailed product pages, customer reviews, and a robust rewards program. You can often find mini versions of popular fragrances, making this a great choice for trying before you commit to a full-sized bottle.

Shopping at these online stores gives you peace of mind. Their direct relationships with brands mean you can trust that every product is authentic. Plus, you’ll often enjoy extras like gift wrapping, reward points, or exclusive access to new releases.

# Online Marketplaces and Their Pros & Cons

Marketplaces like Amazon and eBay are incredibly popular for all types of purchases, including perfumes. But when it comes to fragrances, you’ll need to tread carefully.

**The Pros**:

* **Convenience**: These platforms offer a fast, streamlined shopping experience with multiple sellers competing for your business.
* **Wide Selection**: You can find almost any perfume on these sites, from designer staples to rare, discontinued scents.
* **Competitive Pricing**: Many sellers offer steep discounts, which can be incredibly appealing if you’re on a budget.

**The Cons**:

* **Risk of Counterfeits**: One of the biggest downsides is the possibility of purchasing fake products. While some sellers are legitimate, others cut corners by offering replicas that look identical but lack the quality of the real deal.
* **Inconsistent Packaging**: Buyers frequently report receiving products with damaged or inconsistent packaging, which isn't ideal when gifting or collecting.
* **Limited Returns**: If you do get a counterfeit or faulty product, resolving the issue can be challenging. Not all sellers honor returns or refunds.

To avoid scams, make sure to vet the seller beforehand. Look for listings with high ratings, authentic product photos, and detailed descriptions. Amazon’s “Ships from and Sold by Amazon” tag is often a safer bet, as is eBay’s “Top Rated Seller” icon. Still, if authenticity is your top priority, it may be better to stick with platforms exclusively dedicated to perfumes or department stores.

No matter where you choose to shop, knowing the strengths and potential pitfalls of these platforms is key to a satisfying purchase. Use this guide to find the right spot for your needs and enjoy the convenience of exploring perfumes from the comfort of your home.

# Ensuring Authenticity When Buying Perfumes Online

Shopping for perfumes online can be exciting, but there’s always that lingering worry about authenticity. No one wants to spend their hard-earned money on a counterfeit product that doesn’t match the description—or worse—smells nothing like the real deal. To ensure you're getting a genuine fragrance and not a knockoff, follow these trusted strategies.

# Researching the Seller’s Reputation

One of the easiest ways to prevent a bad purchase is by checking the reputation of the seller. A trustworthy seller isn't just about having a flashy website; their customer feedback says it all.

Start by looking at **reviews and ratings**. What are other customers saying? High-star reviews accompanied by detailed feedback about the product and service can build confidence. Be cautious of sites or sellers with overwhelmingly great ratings but little to no written reviews. Authentic reviews often have specifics—mentioning the packaging, delivery timeframe, or overall buying experience.

Check for **certifications or guarantees** on the website. Sellers often provide clear statements about their commitment to selling genuine products. For instance, look for statements about sourcing directly from the brand or authorized distributors.

Some sellers go the extra mile by showcasing **third-party trust badges** (like Secure Checkout or Trustpilot ratings). If these are legitimate, they signify additional accountability. And don’t forget to explore perfume forums and independent review platforms—fellow fragrance enthusiasts can offer valuable firsthand advice about reliable sellers.

# Checking Product Authenticity Guarantees

Before clicking “buy,” see if the seller provides a guarantee of authenticity. Why is this important? It gives you leverage if something doesn’t feel right when your perfume arrives.

Look for sellers that clearly mention their **return and refund policies**. Can you easily send the product back if it doesn’t meet your expectations? A solid return policy often indicates that a seller is confident about the quality and authenticity of their products.

Does the website mention **authentic sourcing methods**? Some retailers offer transparency about where they obtain their perfumes. If the seller specifies that they purchase directly from the manufacturer or authorized distributors, it’s a positive sign.

Another tip: Check for **batch codes or serial numbers** in the product descriptions or photos. Many genuine fragrance bottles come with unique codes printed on the packaging or bottom of the bottle. These codes can often be checked online to confirm legitimacy. If a seller doesn’t display or mention these, think twice before proceeding.

# Identifying Red Flags for Counterfeit Products

Spotting counterfeits can save you money, frustration, and disappointment. While not every seller with a deal is suspicious, it’s important to watch for red flags.

* **Unbelievably Low Prices**: If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Genuine designer perfumes rarely come with significant markdowns unless part of a verified clearance sale or promotion. A $100 perfume listed for $20 is almost guaranteed to be fake or diluted.
* **Missing Key Product Details**: Real retailers take the time to provide high-quality images and detailed descriptions. If photos are blurry, incomplete, or look copied from another website, proceed with caution. Legitimate sellers highlight fragrance note breakdowns, sizes, and specific details about the bottle and packaging.
* **Inconsistent Packaging or Grammar Issues**: Counterfeit sellers sometimes display packaging that differs slightly from authentic products. Look closely at the font style, spacing, logo placement, and colors. Typos, misspellings, or poorly translated descriptions on the website can be another red flag signaling fraud.
* **No Customer Support**: A legitimate seller will make it easy to contact them. If you can’t find an email, phone number, or customer service chat option, this could indicate a fly-by-night operation.

When in doubt, consider buying only from **official online stores or authorized retailers**. This might mean paying a little more, but it guarantees peace of mind.

By doing a bit of groundwork when shopping for fragrances online, you can steer clear of fakes and enjoy a worry-free experience. The goal is to end up with the perfect scent—not a cheap imitation that lands in the trash.

# Tips for Maximizing Your Online Perfume Shopping Experience

Shopping for perfume online opens up endless possibilities, but it can also feel overwhelming if you're not prepared. With so many options available, knowing how to shop smartly will make your experience more enjoyable while ensuring you get the most value for your money. Below are actionable tips to elevate your online fragrance-buying journey.

# Utilizing Loyalty Programs and Subscription Services

Did you know loyalty programs and subscription services can help you save money while expanding your perfume collection? Many online perfume retailers reward repeat customers by offering points for every purchase. These points can later be redeemed for discounts, free shipping, or even free products.

Some platforms also provide *exclusive perks* like early access to new releases, special gift sets, or complimentary samples. For instance, joining a retailer's VIP program might grant you 10% off your next order, adding up to substantial savings over time. If you frequently shop on one site, signing up for their loyalty program is a no-brainer.

Subscription services take it a step further by delivering curated products straight to your door—often at a fraction of the cost of buying full-sized bottles. These services not only allow you to explore a variety of scents but also help you discover hidden gems you might not have tried otherwise. Look for subscription offers that include discovery boxes or travel-sized samples, so you can test different fragrances without the commitment of a full bottle.

# Timing Your Purchase During Sales and Holidays

Why pay full price when patience can save you a bundle? One of the simplest ways to maximize your online perfume shopping experience is by taking advantage of sales events and holiday promotions. Retailers often slash prices during high-profile shopping days like *Black Friday*, *Cyber Monday*, and seasonal clearance sales.

Additionally, keep an eye out for discounts tied to holidays such as Valentine’s Day or Mother’s Day—major fragrance shopping periods. You can often find **bundled gift sets** at unbeatable prices, combining several products for less than the cost of a single bottle. Another savvy tip? Many online retailers offer exclusive promotions at the end of each season to make way for new inventory. Signing up for email newsletters ensures you’ll never miss these deals.

If you have a specific perfume on your wish list, consider waiting for a sale or using price trackers to alert you when it drops in cost. Timing your purchase strategically can maximize your budget and leave room to try additional fragrances.

# Reading Detailed Product Descriptions Thoroughly

While it’s tempting to base your purchase on a pretty bottle or celebrity endorsement, don’t skip reading the detailed product description. These descriptions are your best friend when shopping online because they answer key questions: *How does the perfume smell?* *Does it suit my preferences?* *Will it last all day?*

First, pay close attention to the breakdown of fragrance notes. For example:

* **Top Notes**: These create the first impression (think citrus or fruity hints).
* **Middle Notes**: These develop as the perfume settles, shaping its character (like florals or spices).
* **Base Notes**: These are the lasting scents that stick around for hours, often warm or woody.

By understanding the layers of a perfume, you can better predict whether it aligns with your preferred scent profile.

Next, look for *key terms* in the description that match your needs. If you like stronger, longer-lasting fragrances, look for mentions of “Eau de Parfum” over “Eau de Toilette.” Similarly, terms like ""summer-ready,"" ""light and airy,"" or ""rich and intense"" give you clues about the perfume’s personality.

Lastly, don’t overlook customer reviews. These often share practical insights—like whether a scent is too overpowering or fades quickly in real-world use. Taking time to read the details ensures you’ll feel confident in your purchase and reduce the risk of disappointment when the box arrives at your doorstep.

# Conclusion

Buying perfume online offers unmatched convenience, a broader selection, and access to valuable tools like customer reviews and exclusive deals. Trusted platforms ensure reliable, authentic products, making it easier than ever to find your perfect scent without leaving home. By shopping responsibly—reading descriptions, checking seller reputations, and considering return policies—you can approach each purchase with confidence.

Take advantage of the flexibility and savings online shopping provides. Start exploring now and discover a fragrance that suits your style, personality, and budget. After all, the right perfume isn’t just a luxury—it’s an expression of who you are.",1,1743871549.0,u_mrescober,0,1.0,False

1js7kut,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1js7kut/my_saturday_morning_after_he_decided_to_drink/,My Saturday morning after he decided to drink last night,"My husband used to be a “heavier” drinker, he lived steps away from a bar, would go down there whenever someone asks him to, especially to socialize but he cannot control his drinking. He would go Sundays every week, Mondays 90% and drink at home on Saturdays. We started dating and long story short, he only drink Saturdays (when he play video games with his “boys”) and if his best friend is in town, he goes Sundays. I came from a family who never drink, so I don’t know if this is normal or not but I still thinking drinking heavily every saturdays is too much. I still need his presence and weekend is the only time we get to spend together without worrying about having something to do like going to work. He calls it his “calm down” time. Anyway, he decided to drink last night because his friends are playing a new game on Xbox. He woke up this morning trying to touch me, I knew this was gonna happen, he was randomly touching my face which got me very annoyed so I told him whatever he is trying to do, I don’t want it, then he tried to push my face turn it so he can kiss me. God that was so annoying, I told him I am not a toy he cannot just move me around. He turned to the other side acting upset. Then he was laughing on something on his phone and turned to me smiling expecting me to ask him what was it. But I wasn’t interested in all of this, the ups and downs, be “funny” one moment and upset the next moment. He got up and asked me if I want coffee trying to make it better, I got up to make mine and we hang out in the living room. He mentioned something sexual and I said it’s not happening, we won’t have s** the day of and the day after he drinks. He said but it makes me last longer I said it’s fine, I would prefer that. He said I don’t know how to please you. Hahah excuse me? I think he knows very well but it is impossible for him to drink in moderation or stop all together, it’s not about pleasing me. He sat down after that acting upset and I knew the next moment would be him mentioning something funny and we would go back to the emotional rollercoaster. So I just picked up my coffee cup and came back to bed. And just a side note: this man can go up to a month or more without having s** with me, I have to remind him (by arguing) how long it has been for him to realize, because most of the time I come to him telling him how much I want him and every time he says no or not today or I have a raid (he plays World of Warcraft ) but even before the game, he just refuses. So there is no way now that I am gonna allow s** just because alcohol makes him horny. He says he gets horny multiple times a day but he is busy playing his video games or his IBS would be acting up and if he moves a lot he would sh** his pants. Seriously?! What am I dealing with, what kind of a man go this long without being intimate with the person her loves?! ",3,1743871192.0,AlAnon,9,1.0,False

Not long after, a young woman sat down beside him and asked, “Excuse me, are you a real cowboy?”

The young woman nodded and said, “I’m a lesbian. I spend most of my day thinking about women. I wake up thinking about women, I shower thinking about women, I eat, watch TV, work—no matter what I’m doing, I’m always thinking about women.”

The cowboy tipped his hat politely, and they both sat in silence sipping their drinks.

1js7js2,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1js7js2/caffeine/,Caffeine,"My spouse made coffee with some new grounds they picked up at the store yesterday. I usually have one cup maybe two. Well, I’m almost finished with the first one and I start to feel incredibly wired. Way more energy than a normal cup has ever given me. Then again, my 5 month old slept for 4 hours in a row last night so I’m thinking maybe the consecutive sleep is just making me feel on top of the world. As the morning progresses though I am feeling very caffeinated. I never even finished my first cup, so I go look at the grounds. He had picked up DEATH WISH COFFEE. It has an ABSURD amount of caffeine. Since it’s grounds it can’t really be measured but he brewed 4tbsp to 20oz of water. The package say 2tbsp for every 6oz, which yields ~165ml of caffeine. With that math and my consumption of 5-6oz, it should be around ~90ml of caffeine for me. Will my baby be okay? I know that recommended dose is to not go over 300ml but I NEVER have this much maybe around 40-50ml a day.

1js7is0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1js7is0/there_was_a_face_in_my_closet_and_a_voice_behind/,There was a face in my closet and a voice behind the door.,"Let me get ahead of your assumptions: I do not suffer from sleep paralysis. My limbs don’t freeze up, my chest doesn’t experience heavy pressures, and I do *not* hallucinate. There’s a ghost in my house, which I’ve come to call a “bedroom” ghost, because I only ever see him in bedrooms. Sometimes it’s my upstairs bedroom, sometimes the kids’ on the first floor, sometimes the spare guest room across from mine. He doesn’t walk the halls to the various bedrooms, not that I’ve seen, and he doesn’t sit in the corner of your eye when you’re in any other part of the house. If you want to see him, he’s going to be in a bedroom.

Most people, I think, don’t really know how they’d react if they saw a ghost. I’d wager even the artists, authors, and moviemakers tend to get it wrong. You don’t turn a ghastly white, you don’t shriek, you don’t run. At least, I didn’t, and I consider myself as average as it gets. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still damn scary. But in that moment, it feels, I don’t know, foolish to get up and run or scream. It just happens too fast for any of that. I think the scariest thing, the thing that really lingers, is the fact that it’s *real*. One second the world is more or less how you think it is, and the next, you’ve seen a ghost. It changes the way you see everything once you have some assurance that we go on. But the philosophical ramifications of the existence of the Bedroom Ghost are not what I’m here to discuss with you.

My message is actually a good deal briefer. The Bedroom Ghost is evil. You can stop there if you want, because everything I’ve got to say now is just an elaboration on that fact. But do not forget it. I don’t know if this ghost is specific to my bedroom, or if he has a plethora of bedrooms he forays into in the evenings. I don’t see him every night, but I’m sure he keeps busy. So if there’s a chance that one evening, as the moon climbs high and your thoughts begin to wander with decreasing effort into nonsensical dreaming, and you see the glimmer of white eyes ever so faintly in the crack of your closet door, heed these next words, because you may be experiencing a visit from the Bedroom Ghost.

I first saw him one evening when I couldn’t sleep. I’d lived in the house for a while even then, at least five years. My wife had gone to bed before me, per usual, and the kids had gone down at least an hour before her. I enjoyed that quiet time in the evening, a couple of hours just spent reading or playing games or watching a movie that was too violent for my kids or too frightening for my wife. Some guys have an old car in their garage, others have shed beers, others a man-cave with a pool table and stocked bar, but for me, the dark, quiet, midnight house was my escape.

I’d spent the evening watching a bad zombie flick on my laptop, rocking back and forth in the living room recliner, listening to the sounds of exaggerated carnage and corpseish moans, the only light coming from the glowing blue aurora of my screen. When the credits rolled, the clock read just after midnight. Time for me to turn in.

I crept up the stairs, cautious to avoid the creak on the seventh step, and shuffled down the hallway using my phone screen as a flashlight. Whenever I made this walk, I felt like the modern visage of Ebeneezer Scrooge with his candlestick, though I swapped the evening gown for a pair of sweatpants. I was reminded of what it was like to wander a dark hallway alone as a kid, when all the doors and walls are three feet taller, and the darkness is alive with whatever your imagination deems to exist in those shadowy corners. Even as an adult, you don’t really lose that sense of unease, although your ability to rationalize it away is stronger.

I crossed into my room, switched off my phone, and using my own muscle memory of the space, navigated the dark until I was slipping into bed with my wife. I lay there for a while, the images of the movie I had just finished playing in a mental slideshow of cheap effects and lazy dialogue. After maybe ten minutes, I thought sleep would come. It didn’t. My mind wandered a little, the beginnings of a dream beginning to form, but it stopped suddenly at a stir from Elizabeth. I rolled to my other side and tried again. A few more minutes rolled by and my thoughts still would not quiet.

I suspected with growing dread that I may be suffering from another bout of insomnia, an affliction that hit me once or twice a month that made the next day a living hell. Deciding I didn’t want to be a zombie myself at work tomorrow, I resolved to rummage up a melatonin from the medicine cabinet. I sat up, opened my eyes, and froze.

My closet, across from my bed, was a black nowhere six feet from the footboard. And hovering still and silent in that space was a moon. Only it wasn’t a moon, of course it wasn’t a moon. It looked like one, pale and placid, round and illuminescent, suspended against a black, starless, backdrop. And like the moon, it had a face. But this face wasn’t a pattern of craters. It was smiling, and its teeth were white, its cheeks full, its eyes bright and intelligent.

Its hairless visage was both old and young, old in its size, but infantile in its energy, the fullness of its cheeks, the roundness of its chin. And its intelligence, apparent somehow even in those first seconds, was ageless.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t even jump. It looked at me and I looked back at it. There wasn’t any point trying to rationalize it. I wasn’t hallucinating, I wasn’t paralyzed in bed, and I wasn’t dreaming. I felt a tremendous amount of fear, and my hands and feet were shaking, while a sick, cold wind blew out from the closet where it stood or floated. There was no way to think about what I could or should do. I didn’t think to wake my wife or grab my phone or leave the room. There was something a little wondrous to that first night, and strange as it may sound, I didn’t want to turn my head only to look back and find it gone. Some people spend their whole lives looking for something like this, something inexplicable, something truly preternatural. On that first night, I felt almost privileged to be able to look at it, even though I thought I could vomit up my own heart at any second.

Maybe it was my fear, maybe it was shock, maybe it was just the automatic response system of the human body taking over, but as I sat there staring at the pale grinning visage, I did something I can’t really account for. I lifted up my right hand just to my shoulder, and with a little shake, waved at the face.

Its smile broadened.

I still didn’t have words. At the time, I wondered if I’d ever regain the ability to speak. The Ghost didn’t have much to offer at that time either by way of conversation, but in response, I saw a small, disembodied hand, the same pallid shade as the face, appear from the depths of the closet and gently wave back at me.

Then, the face receded into the shadows, the last thing to vanish the long white teeth.

I sat up that night for I don’t know how long. Hours, maybe. I did fall asleep, I must have, because I remember waking up to an alarm and the sounds of my wife readying Duncan and Delphi for school. Of course I was useless that day, both at home and at work. I couldn’t think of anything other than my nocturnal visitor. I didn’t tell Elizabeth about what I saw for the reasons you’d expect: I didn’t want her to think that we lived in a cursed house, or that I was just insane. I’m not insane. Instead, I shambled downstairs, poured my cup of coffee, nodded blankly at the list of to-do items Elizabeth had in store for the day, tied my shoes, and drove to work.

I consider myself a fairly diligent person, but at work that first day I didn’t do a damn thing other than scour the internet for any sort of answer on what I might have seen. Most of the search results suggested sleep paralysis, which I had already ruled out. The other options could be limited to two broad categories: ghosts and demons, although, depending on who you asked, there may not have been much difference between the two. At this point, I probably should’ve done the normal thing and contacted a priest, or a reverend, or someone who knew God better than I did. Of course I, having just seen a ghost, was still somehow too rational to consider the possibility that God could help. Or maybe, perhaps more honestly, there was a part of me that didn’t want to run the thing off. I remember thinking that God had neve bothered to show His face in my closet before, give me a how-do-you-do. Whatever this thing was, it at least had the decency to wave back. What a damn fool thing to believe.

The next couple of weeks went unremarkably. I’d sit up for an hour or two in bed, sometimes with a laptop or a paperback, sometimes with nothing at all but an eye for the open closet door. The face didn’t reappear. The cold wind didn’t blow out. And the shadows did not stir.

I refused to write off the first experience as anything other than factual reality. I knew what I saw, believed in it. I would not convince myself otherwise for the sake of rationalizing. I think I did a decent job keeping the thing to myself as well. I regained my composure after the first day, resumed my work and family obligations, but I really only had one thought buzzing around in my head. I mean, who in my place wouldn’t? Like I said earlier: Undisputed proof of the preternatural, evidence of something beyond just ourselves. Sure, it wasn’t scientific data, tested and peer-reviewed, but it was enough for me. Had I never seen the ghost again, I wonder if I might have sunk further into my obsession with it, forever chasing that singular moment where every truth of the universe I thought self-evident was overturned.

For better or worse, that was not to be my last encounter with the Bedroom Ghost. It was a Saturday. Elizabeth had taken the kids to their gymnastics lesson with her sister. I stayed behind to catch up on some chores. For the first time in weeks, I wasn’t actively thinking about the Ghost. I was just walking down the hall with a basket of dirty laundry in my arms. I walked out of our bedroom and towards Delphine’s. I was reaching for the knob when suddenly the door began pounding from the inside.

I dropped the basket and stumbled back.

“Phi-Phi, you still here? Didn’t Mom take you to gymnastics?” I know, stupid questions, I had literally watched them leave.

“Don’t open the door, Daniel.” A voice from the inside said. It was low and silky, a baritone stronger suited for song than speech. Yet it seemed genderless, ageless, both a man and a woman’s voice, a child’s and a crone’s.

I didn’t open the door. I didn’t pick up the basket. I didn’t move an inch.

“Police report eleven fatalities after a city bus blew a tire on interstate seventy-five,” the voice said suddenly, its tone switching from its impossible combination to that of a female news anchor. “Witnesses to the tragic accident state that the bus’s back right tire blew out, causing the tail end to swerve into a tractor-trailer truck behind it, which led to more vehicles piling up in what is believed to be the deadliest traffic accident of the year so far.”

I didn’t know what to say, what to think, before the voice changed again. It was a man’s voice, but it was accented in what might have been Russian, but it still sounded like a news anchor.

“The latest UN security council numbers indicate the drone strike killed at least seven members of army top brass. There’s not much way of validating these numbers, as the administration is reluctant to report any losses.”

Then the voice changed again.

“I’m so, so, sorry ma’am.” It was a man’s voice, but it was an American accent, maybe from the South. It sounded on the brink of breaking. “I couldn’t see her. We’ve always used this land for hunting, got the warning signs up and everything. I just saw movement by the bait and…”

Then, it was just a shriek. A woman’s shriek, loud, agonized, an answer to the stuttering man’s voice from a second before.

By then, I had collapsed, slumped against the wall, pressing my hands to my ears.

“Daniel,” the voice said in its original impossible intonation. “Daniel.” I didn’t answer. “Daniel.”

“What?!” I demanded.

Nothing. The voice made no answer. Then, it repeated, “Daniel.”

“Who are you?” Now that I had found my voice, I remembered how to use it. “How did you- what was all that?”

“Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.”

“*What!*” I repeated. There was another pause. Then,

“Daniel.”

In a moment of horror that was somehow worse than even listening to the gruesome reports it had just channeled, I realized that the Ghost was taunting me. Like a playground bully. For lack of a better way of putting it, the Ghost was simply being mean.

“Daniel.”

“Daniel.”  
“Daniel.”

“Don’t open the door, Daniel.”

Once it began talking to me, it wouldn’t stop. If ever I found myself alone in or near a bedroom, it would start up again. It would ask me about work, about Elizabeth, about the kids. It would tell me that the odds Delphi would break her ankle at gymnastics today were significantly higher due to a loose bolt in the balancing beam. It would tell me that Elizabeth had been talking with her sister about feelings she had developed for one of the dads in Delphi’s group, a stern, ex-military, widower who was wholly devoted to his kids, and absolutely did not stay up later than everyone to watch stupid movies or read penny dreadfuls. It would tell me that my job was a dead-end, and my position was invented to satisfy reporting numbers and balance some books, that I could just disappear off the payroll one day and the company would probably be better off for it.

  
But mostly, it just said my name.

  
Over and over again. Sometimes it used Elizabeth’s voice. Sometimes it used the kids, though it had the audacity to call me “Dad” whenever it mimicked them. One time I blew up at it, telling it to fuck off, screaming and cursing, only to realize it really had been Elizabeth calling for me. Of course, that was likely its intention the whole time. To bait me. Get me mad.

 

And always, always, always, the voices came from behind closed doors in my house’s bedrooms. And then there were the evenings. I started sleeping on the couch after I had accidentally yelled at Elizabeth. Doghouse or not, it was a welcome relief from being in a bedroom and near that damned closet. Then, two nights in, the stomping started. My bedroom is just above the living room and, like an upstairs tenet urging his noisy downstairs neighbor to keep quiet, it would stomp the floor over and over again. Dust would shake from the ceiling, it stomped so hard. I collected some of the debris once, held it in my hand to make sure it really was physical dust, that it really had fallen from the ceiling because something had shaken it free. I don’t know how it did this without waking my family. In fact, a small mercy in all this was that it seemed totally uninterested in them, unless it was using their names to torment me.

“Good chance the minivan hydroplanes today,” it said to me as I was getting ready for work one morning after Elizabeth had left with the kids for school. Rain was pounding on the windows outside as I stared directly into my bedroom mirror and fastened my necktie. “Daniel. Did you hear? Much higher than normal chance. Roads are slick slick slick today. And you know how Elizabeth gets when the kids fight, can’t focus. Probably will happen this time, to be frank with you. Daniel.”

I tried to ignore it, slipping the tie through the knot for the third time only for the damn thing to come unraveled again. I looked down, my hands shaking, and managed to get the knot tied. I looked back up at the mirror and leapt back.

The reflection showed it was in the closet again, the face. Grinning. I turned around and sure enough, it was there. It gave me a sly wink.

“Daniel. That’s not even considering what will happen at work today. Didn’t you hear? Evans is launching surprise competency tests. Wants to make sure everyone’s checking their emails, being a team player. How long has it been since you read one of those little things cluttering up your inbox? Doesn’t matter, too late now. Most likely you’ll be let go. Chances are very high for that today. Daniel.”

“Please leave me alone.” I said.

“Daniel? Daniel. Daniel!” It demanded.

“What?” I said.

“Have you heard? It’s not good news, I’m afraid. Cancer. Ugh, I can smell it from here. Your liver, it has to be. Advanced stage, too. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. The children are young, Elizabeth too. Not even forty! Plenty of time for them all to move on. Daniel.”

“Why are you here?” I asked, maybe for the fiftieth time that week.

“Mrs. Ryan? Ma’am, my name is Lieutenant Jack Moser. I served with your husband, Steve. I’m here to-

No, please.  
Steve was a fine soldier.

No, God, please God no please. Please. Please please please please…”

It viciously mimicked the sound of a military wife breaking down for the rest of the time it took for me to leave the house. I never learned if it made up these little tidbits, or if it was channeling something that had actually happened. I never bothered to look up any of the names or stories it gave me, just in case they were true.

I left the house without looking back, though I could feel it glaring at me from the upstairs bedroom window.

I don’t know how I survived those first few months of hell. I prayed a lot. It helped, I think. But if I ever dared to pray aloud, it would get so angry. It would threaten Elizabeth and the kids. So I kept my mouth shut.

At this point in the movies, the protagonist would be figuring out a way to banish the spirit, or otherwise succumb to possession or madness. I wasn’t so lucky as that. It pushed me to the brink of sanity, I think, but never allowed me to slip over the edge. There wasn’t much fun in bullying an insane man, I suppose, because he doesn’t really care all that much anymore. Instead, just as the gulf of madness seemed ready to envelop me, the Bedroom Ghost would reel me back in. It would disappear. Go quiet. Life would improve. Then, just as he was fading to the back of my mind, he would start again. “Daniel.”

Naturally, some of his predictions started coming true. Delphi really did break her ankle at a gymnastics meet, though it was when another girl fell on her rather than a faulty balancing beam. And Elizabeth asked that I start taking the kids on the weekends because, “in the spirit of honesty and love,” she had been *tempted* by another child’s father. Luckily, they didn’t wreck the minivan, nor did I have liver cancer (which I learned only after requesting an extensive and pricey screening).

It’s been four years since the Bedroom Ghost first appeared in my closet. He’s on sabbatical for the time being. It’s his longest yet. Maybe he’s gone for good, maybe he’ll be back. I try not to get my hopes up. Maybe I should take up church in the meantime. I don’t know. I’m so damn tired. I feel like my mind has been stretched again and again like an elastic band, and it loses some of its tautness with each pull. I’ve lost weight, hair, and sleep. My family is still as unaffected as ever, at least. Counting my blessings on that front at least.

I placed my pen down and stare at the pages of the journal chronicling my experience with the Bedroom Ghost. I don’t know why I felt the urge to write it all down, but I’m glad I did. Maybe it will be useful to someone, someday.

I hear the patter of footsteps outside in the hall. The door swung open, a gust of cold air hitting the back of my chair. My heart stopped.

“Dad?”

My shoulders slump with relief. “Hey sport, everything okay?” I spun the desk chair and offer Duncan a weak but earnest smile.

“Yeah, what do you need?”  
“Sorry? Need?”  
“Yeah. Will it take long?”  
“Duncan, what are you talking about?”  
“C’mon Dad, I heard you call my name all the way from downstairs.”",3,1743871035.0,nosleep,1,0.8,False

Our findings have come up empty however we’ve had quite an adventure of our own the past couple of days and so much fun treasure hunting for the first time! People forget how much of the American West still lives in this area of Texas and once you start looking, it’s filled to the brim with stories of bandits, wars, shoots-outs, etc. From the Contrabando Movie Set, to an unfindable Starbucks sign that apparently exists, or at least existed at one point, and finally to a super cool little ghost town called Shafter, Texas. Here’s some of what led us to these places:

- Big Bend National Park on the map is at least 100 miles away from where it actually is. The park is actually “beyond the maps edge”, which could be an error from the third party but seems like a pretty big oversight for Justin considering he is from Texas.

- Contrabando Movie Set: More likely a checkpoint than the location, while you don’t have to go through any park entrances to pay, it is still technically part of the Big Bend State Park which is $5. (I’ll let you research this on your own, but there are some pretty BIG references in his book) 

- Starbucks Sign: Shoutout to the double coffee mugs in the documentary. This sign is apparently located in Redford, Texas (basically inside the state park but is a legitimate town on the border of Texas/Mexico). It’s not a Starbucks, just a sign, kinda like an art piece (there’s a few art pieces like this in this area of Texas so not uncommon). Either it’s been torn down or moved because it was impossible for us to find lol

 - Shafter, Texas: By far the coolest place I researched and I suggest going regardless of the treasure. A once booming silver mining town of 4000-6000 residents has dwindled to 11-30 residents and what is left is the reminders of that past. They even have a unique, locally ran, free “museum” that captures the towns history and the families that live there (you won’t find it on a map but the “town” is not big so you just have to find it). Apparently there is still ALOT of silver to be mined so they could resume operations again. The locals are proud of their history and there are still families that live there so please be respectful of this if you do visit.
- bonus: The combo on the show was 44-26-1-11. Shafter happens to be 111 miles from Big Bend National Park. There were other things we found that gave us the 44 and 26 mile markers but that was the big one.

We searched high and low, and as true with most people who have a theory, felt like we were RIGHT THERE. We now have to leave the area and search behind. Do what you will with this information and best of luck!",5,1743871023.0,TreasureHunting,0,1.0,False

The only problem with that is that I have never been good at talking to people, I never can think of anything to say! I like conversations where I talk about the things that interest me and the other people are listening to me and I like listening to others talk about what interests them. All of the small talk type stuff, I just don’t get. On top of that I get very anxious about offending someone or coming across as pushy and so I’m scared of forcing myself into a conversation where I’m obviously not entirely wanted and the others just think of me as a nuisance. Part of that also makes it hard to find other trans people to talk to because I don’t want to clock anyone and make them feel bad, since I still just look like my assigned sex at birth and don’t want to be misunderstood as being a phobe. I also just get anxious at even the prospect of introducing myself to someone with a different name and pronouns so I don’t know how to even do that.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to get past this barrier? I feel like it’s all that’s stopping me from being able to actually work on myself at this point. I don’t know how much of it is an autism thing and how much is a general anxiety thing but I just fundamentally do not understand conversations there is no equation to describe them that gives the righr answer. Even if I can’t make trans friends (but i should be able to there are lots of us at my college) what are some tips in general for talking to people and/or finding others to talk to?

I’ve lived all across Canada and never had such horrible Tim Hortons in my life. Ran by the losers of Corey Craig group. I 100% believe this woman bc when I choked on a piece of plastic in my ice cap, the store refused to even speak to me. 



Original Post:


What is this?! (Update used a magnet confirmed metal) ⚠️TIM HORTONS⚠️
Caramel iced cap, it’s not coffee grains or anything. It’s like sparkly!!?! I took a few drinks and found it tasted really weird, not like caramel at all. Tim Hortons Corey Craig Group
Called the manager at the richibucto location.. he asked me to text him pictures and he’d call me back. He said it’s frozen ice and didn’t happen to anyone else and then hung up on me while I was saying that’s unacceptable !!! 


*updates video with a magnet!!! It IS metal like I told them!!! Sent to the district manager (march 26)


**another update (march 27) district manager is still dismissing it as being metal and saying they’re not responsible once it leaves the restaurant & that it didn’t happen to anyone else and provided me with their internal auditors number. I still have the half drank melted ice cap and it is not ice as they keep saying!!! It’s metal that I ingested!! Not stopping until I get answers.


#timhortonscanada #richibucto


**UPDATE (april 4th) Karen woodman the internal auditor asked me to stop posting until we knew more because she was on my side and would have the iced cap tested.. well here’s the update!!!! On April 1st they took place of the iced cap to get tested. Yesterday she replied that she would have “results today” and they issue me a NO TRESPASS at 13 locations because they got rid of my evidence!!!! 


I’ve attached the letters & convos with this Karen woodman who on the phone told me I should get blood work done for the metals and that she was on my side and would test it, had me bring it to the bouctouche Tim’s!!! INSANE!!!! 


The food inspector went last week 4 days after the metal iced cap was served to me and found their machine clean.. lots of time to get rid of what they did!!! I told the inspector I didn’t want to hand my evidence over to them and he said they weren’t equipped with anywhere to do testing for it and said I could give it to them to test. 

WHAT ARE YOU HIDING TIM HORTONS????? Serving toxic heavy metals to people, telling them you’ll help and have it tested and get to the bottom of it and then serve a no trespass letter!!!!!😡😡😡😡


*last attached photo is the almost week old iced cap on April 1st when they had me bring it to the bouctouche location.

1js7dg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1js7dg3/intense_interview_for_low_level_position_mi/,Intense Interview for Low Level Position? [MI],"I interviewed for an Office Assistant position. $20-$25 an hour at 30 hours/week. Good benefits. Approximately 70 employees at company located in remote area. Posting said there would be a blend of HR duties. 

During initial Zoom interview with 4 people, I asked what a typical work day might look like. I was told I would need to get to work early so I could get the coffee going and make sure the lunchroom was tidied up, snacks had been restocked, etc. I was also told I'd need to make runs to the post office, pick up catering, etc. They asked if I'd be okay with this. I indicated I've done this type of stuff before and was good with it. I also asked if there would be other types of work to do & they said yes, there'd be some - like helping with payroll, revamping their online help portal for employees, etc., but they kept coming back to the more menial tasks. 

I then get asked to come in for an in person interview. I say yes. They then send the agenda which is for 2 hours 30 minutes. It includes asking me to prepare and give a 30 minute Power Point presentation showcasing my technical & presentation skills as it relates to the job. I thought this was overkill because if my main job focus is errand running and making sure snacks are stocked why the need for a 30 minute PP in front of 5 people, including the company president, to showcase my presentation/technical skills? I stay positive and think well maybe they recognize from my phone interview that I am capable of more and the role can grow. I decide to really go for it and put a lot of effort into the presentation, which I was told was “amazing.” 

There was also a 30 minute Excel test where I was asked to show I could create bar graphs, pivot tables and do some basic formulas, which I do. There’s also another set of interview questions where they came back again to more menial tasks and asking if I’m okay with things like stocking & inventory. They also spent 30 minutes going over their benefits package in great detail, like to the point of giving an example of how much I would actually pay out of pocket if I bought a $200 pair of eyeglasses. I end up being there for 3 hours.

I did not end up getting a job offer. I ended up feeling like the whole thing was a huge waste of time. What bothers me most, is I felt like if I had presented myself as less skilled and less qualified I would have had a better chance! I realize I am over qualified for the job, but my resume reflected that from the beginning. I was looking for a less stressful job where I could still do great work and was fine with the job tasks. I’m confused by what they were actually wanting because based on the job description the process was very intense, but given what they were asking for I kept thinking maybe there’s more & this is my chance to shine. I spent a lot of time thoughtfully preparing as I wanted to give the process respect. Also what was the point of going over the benefits in great detail with me if you’re not going to extend an offer? I received no feedback, was just told they selected someone else.

Re posting it here cause it got removed from my city’s sub, not sure if this is the right place to post. 

Okay, so this might sound like something straight out of a rom-com (or a Netflix short film), but it genuinely happened and I’m still a little dazed about it.

Let’s rewind to July 2024. I was at Phoenix Mall, casually hanging out at Starbucks, just enjoying my coffee and scrolling through my phone. This guy walks up and politely asks if someone’s sitting opposite me. I said no, and that was it. He sat down, opened his laptop, and started working. I barely glanced at him until I noticed okay, he’s very recognisable. One of those people who just… stand out. Tall, sharply dressed, confident vibe, that kind of face you don’t forget. No conversation beyond that, but the interaction stuck in my head for some reason.

Fast forward a few weeks, I was at another café, totally different area, random Saturday evening. Guess who I see again? Same guy. Same quiet solo vibe, laptop open, working. He didn’t notice me this time (I think?), but I was weirdly shaken. I mean, Chennai is big. What are the odds? I brushed it off as coincidence.

Cut to Thursday this week, I went to lunch at Dou in Alwarpet. And then bam…. There he is again. This time in a classy beige linen shirt and pants, looking like he walked out of a Pinterest board. Alone, working. 

At this point, I was half laughing to myself in disbelief. Three times?! Three different places, three different months, and all completely unplanned. It genuinely felt like the universe was playing some softcore “Before Sunrise” type script on me.

And the worst part? I wanted to talk to him this time. Like badly. But I didn’t. I chickened out. Again. Now I’m sitting here wondering what kind of plotline I just lived through and if it’s already over before it even started.

Anyway, thanks for reading my accidental meet-cute-that-wasn’t. If any of you are reading this and believe in signs or fate or whatever… tell me I’m not crazy?
