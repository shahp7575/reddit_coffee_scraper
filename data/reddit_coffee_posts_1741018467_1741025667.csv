Trying to keep it around $3k without flights. Husband has never been to an AI so I’d love for his first time to be a great experience.

Important to us: food(!), nice rooms, service, cleanliness, quiet/relaxing. This is very much a chill by the pool, beach and maybe do an excursion type trip.  

The vibe of Unico looks amazing but I’ve read reviews about their lack of beach/not as pleasing as other resorts. The 1 hour ride from airport isn’t exactly my jam but if the place is worth it then obviously I’ll do it. Again, from pictures and TikTok it looks very nice!

ERC looks great as well and have read the service is great- is the club level worth it?

Looking at just a regular oceanview or oceanfront room/suite, no swim up. 

We’re not big drinkers (I do enjoy champagne and wine and will obv take advantage of the AI) but we do love our coffee, juices, smoothies, etc.

I wanted to start this off with something you've heard a million times, something that's probably lost all meaning at this point and the seven letters make your stomach churn; I'm sorry. 

I'm aware of my mistakes last night, I'm not proud of them, and if you could see the way I shuttered into my seat upon the realization that my eyes were playing tricks on me; you'd probably stare on in disgust. I wouldn't be able to deny you that right, I'm disgusted with myself for the way my mind bends, twists, and contorts things when my left brain takes over. 

We just got done talking today before work- granted, it was through our voice memos to ensure we don't cut eachother off. I wish we had thought of this earlier, and I wish I wasn't so opposed to them in the first place. I believe I know now, why I was opposed (even though the melody of your voice is something I could listen to like a new found song that speaks to parts of my soul that seemed unimaginable). 

It was because I enjoy going back and reflecting on our conversations, and reading the sweet (and spicy) things we would send to eachother. After a certain amount of time, the voice memos fade into obscurity or won't load through messenger; plus, I can't search for keywords like Applebee's. 

It was both gut wrenching and uplifting covering those topics today.. gut wrenching because, the pain in your voice, and the tears I hear from the other end of the phone will echo in my head all my life. Knowing I caused the river when I should have been building the bridge over the other issues is one of my deepest sorrows of the present and past. Uplifting because, I'm overjoyed to even be having the dialog with you, and the fact you feel safe enough to lean into me, still, after everything? I'm proud of you, in an immeasurable way, I don't feel I deserve it; but I thank you for letting me weather any and all storms with you.

Yet still, I'm aware my emotions are only a cup of water for the ocean of pain you're feeling. I would empty the cup of water and scoop the entire ocean to the beach if it meant finding you and pulling you out of it. I'd brave the sharks, and every manner of horrors the darkest depths have to hide, if it meant pulling you to the safety of the cliffs and bringing you inside our lighthouse to bring you a warm coffee, a blanket, and even still; a warmer hug. 

For some reason, three months keeps ringing in my head. How selfish of me, for you to simply make an analogy and for my mind to linger on it as if it's an ultimatum, or a milestone. Pain is relative, you're right. Especially for our situation, I believe three months is modest, however, the thought of missing you for three months is the most intense feeling of lachrymose I may have ever experienced. 

All this to say, I don't wish to tug at your already delicate heart strings, I wish to enjoy music from those strings in the future and I need to handle them with exponentially more care than I have. I told you I would wait a lifetime, I believe I've already waited, or danced this dance with you in thousands; what's one more? The thought of not grabbing your morning coffee, not hearing you wake up and take that large inhale, before saying, ""good morning handsome""; not holding you in my arms and wiping the tears before they reach your jaw - it's enough to make even the most emotionally stable man unleash a tsunami uponst himself. 

I hope your day goes well, remember to laugh; you could brighten the colosseum with a chuckle.",1,1741025369.0,u_MyAngelMaker,0,1.0,False

1j2oyjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1j2oyjj/i_thought_i_was_the_only_one_what_does_gad_feel/,I thought I was the only one - what does GAD feel like for you?,"I have triggers from time to time like I cant eat beef anymore because im scared of a bacteria cows carry, I cant drink coffee because im convinced it will trigger my derealization, i cant try new foods because im scared ill have an allergic reaction that will send me into the ER, and I can't be around anyone smoking weed or dare smoke it myself anymore because im terrified of that it will send me into psychosis and I'll become a schizophrenic. Usually in these cases of anxiety caused by my triggers, I always think of the plan out - *wheres the nearest hospital if im going into anaphylactic shock? are the people im currently with able to take me there in time? wheres my phone to call 911 if i need it?* (writing this down makes me realize how crazy It sounds). This is my triggered anxiety, the kind of anxiety that causes panic and doesn't usually last as long, I call it the ""small anxious thoughts"". Then I also have ""dark anxiety"" the ""big anxious thoughts"" (idk how else to phrase it) the kind that causes darkness and hopelessness, usually lasting a bit longer and is followed by depression. Usually the dark anxiety bubbles up in times of derealization or the life analyzing. When I ask the big question ""what if it all goes wrong"" referring to *everything*. I feel like nothing is in my control and I have to escape it all, run away as fast as I can until I no longer exist because the feeling of my presence in the world is unbearable. Then there's a looming darkness through it all, the notion that this is how it is and how it will always be and a life lived like this is meaningless and unbearable. Its the **worst** kind of anxiety.

I was an anxious kid. I usually went through day to day dealing with the ""small anxious thoughts"". *why isnt mum home yet, did she get in an accident? what if i have an allergy to peanuts and I just don't know it? what if I fail this test and get kicked out of school?* stuff like that. It wasnt until I started university and moved out of my home did I start to feel the ""big anxious thoughts"" at first I didnt even know it was anxiety, I didnt even know I ever struggled with anxiety until it got bad. the first time I ever experienced derealization was the first time I ever had suicidal ideation. I would just like to clarify that i am *not* in anyway suicidal currently, however through that episode of my life i was experiencing real darkness with my anxiety. I thought i was the only one going through what i was going through, I thought nothing mattered and that this was what life was going to be like from now on, I was so for certain sure that I was on the brink of some sort of psychotic episode and that I would live my life as a 'crazy' person. I would call home and my sister in tears and I remember saying ""*I cant live like this, its unbearable. If this is what its going to be like I cant go on."".*

when you live your life having nothing bad ever really happen to you, its easy to think that the one bad thing going on right now feels like everything and will last now and forever. I can confirm only 6 months later that I am tremendously better, not fully recovered, but better. i am too scared to start my meds, but I did a few rounds of therapy. It helped but I feel it honestly got better the more familiar the feeling of anxiety got. I recognize it, understand I am safe to be feeling this way and that life goes on and it will be ok. It also helped to distract myself, I don't mean watching tv or anything like that, but putting my thinking towards something productive.

I am now debating a big move to Montreal. There are a lot of great things for me there, its a beautiful city and I have a lot of friends there, but ultimately im terrified. I am currently attending a university close to home, and it made it easier to come home when I felt unsafe and uncomfortable. But moving 7 hours away makes that harder. I am scared of things getting bad again but i keep telling myself that I know *the feeling* im familiar with that darkness and I know those big anxious thoughts very well at this point.

if you have any advice for me please let me know! and if you have any questions about GAD, id love to answer.",1,1741024992.0,neurodiversity,0,1.0,False

As I've posted about before I felt the original NMH was too small and not tall enough. I liked many things about Isibricks' MOC made from 2 sets of NMH, but there were also things I would change. So bought the instructions for it and a 2nd museum set, and decided to challenge myself to make a MOC of a MOC

Since I've only recently gotten back into Lego I'm far from an experienced builder, but I've picked up some techinques from the modulars I've put together and figured it would be a good learning experience.

Today I finished the ground floor. The changes I've made from Isibricks' design are:

* Removed the coffee shop and the elevated floor on the left side of the building to make space for the 2nd skeleton there. I wanted them both on the ground floor.
* Removed the curators office on the right side of the building.
* Moved the earth/minerals exhibit to the curators office, off the Paleontology section.
* Moved the replica pottery exhibit to where the coffee shop was.
* Added a bay window at the left side of the building (where the entrance to the coffee shop was) to break up the very symmetrical design.

I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. What do you think=

1j2ouyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j2ouyd/the_account_that_knew_too_much_it_predicted_my/,The Account That Knew Too Much: It Predicted My Life,"It started with a notification.

I was scrolling through my phone, half-asleep, when a ping pulled me out of my drowsiness. *“@YourFate has followed you.”* I frowned. The username was strange, and the profile picture was just a black square. I tapped on it, expecting a bot or some spam account, but what I saw made my stomach drop.

The account had only one post—a photo of me.

It was me, standing in my kitchen, wearing the same pajamas I had on right now. The timestamp was from five minutes ago. My heart raced as I glanced around the room, half-expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows. But I was alone. The photo was impossible. I hadn’t taken any pictures tonight, and no one else was here.

I blocked the account and tried to shake off the unease. It was probably just some weird glitch or a prank. Right?

The next morning, I woke up to another notification. *“@YourFate has posted a new story.”* My stomach churned as I opened the app. The story was a video, just a few seconds long. It showed me walking into my office building, which I did every morning. But the timestamp was from 8:15 a.m.—an hour from now.

I told myself it was a coincidence. Maybe someone had hacked my phone or was using some kind of deepfake technology. But as I walked into my office at exactly 8:15 a.m., I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

The posts kept coming.

A photo of me tripping on the stairs at work. A video of me spilling coffee on my shirt. Each one was timestamped for the future, and each one came true. I tried to change my actions—I took the elevator instead of the stairs, I avoided drinking coffee—but no matter what I did, the predictions always came true. It was like the account wasn’t just predicting my future; it was controlling it.

I reported the account to the platform, but nothing happened. The posts kept coming, each one more unsettling than the last. Then, one night, I got the notification that changed everything.

*“@YourFate has posted a new photo.”*

I opened it, my hands trembling. The photo showed me lying on the floor of my living room, my eyes wide and unseeing, a pool of blood spreading beneath me. The timestamp was for tomorrow night.

I didn’t sleep that night. I called the police, but they brushed it off as a prank. I thought about leaving town, but what if the account followed me? What if there was no escaping it?

The next day, I tried to stay in public places, surrounded by people. I even considered checking into a hotel, but something stopped me. If this was real—if this account really could predict my death—then running wouldn’t help. I had to face it.

As the hours ticked by, I grew more and more paranoid. Every sound made me jump. Every shadow seemed to move. By the time I got home that night, I was a nervous wreck. I locked all the doors and windows, turned on every light, and sat in the middle of the living room, clutching my phone.

The timestamp on the photo was for 11:47 p.m. At 11:30, I started pacing. At 11:40, I called a friend, but they didn’t answer. At 11:45, I heard a noise outside.

My heart stopped.

I crept to the window and peeked through the blinds. The street was empty. But then I heard it again—a soft tapping, like someone knocking on glass. It was coming from the back door.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and approached the door, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. The tapping grew louder, more insistent. I reached for the handle, my hand shaking so badly I could barely grip it.

I opened the door.

There was no one there.

I let out a shaky breath and started to close the door, but then I saw it—a shadow, moving in the corner of my eye. I turned, but it was too late. Something slammed into me, knocking me to the ground. The knife clattered out of my hand as I struggled to get up, but a weight pressed down on me, pinning me in place.

I looked up and saw… myself.

It was me, but not me. The figure had my face, my clothes, but its eyes were black voids, and its smile was too wide, too sharp. It leaned down, its breath cold against my skin.

“You should have listened,” it whispered.

Then everything went black.

I woke up on the floor of my living room, my head pounding. For a moment, I thought it had all been a nightmare. But then I saw the blood—my blood—pooling beneath me. I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t obey. My vision blurred, and I realized I was dying.

The last thing I saw was my phone, lying on the floor beside me. The screen lit up with a notification.

*“@YourFate has posted a new photo.”*

The account is still active. It posts every day, photos and videos of people going about their lives, unaware of what’s coming. Sometimes, it posts their deaths. I don’t know who—or what—is behind it, but I do know this: if you get a notification from @YourFate, don’t ignore it.

But don’t follow it, either.

Not the kind of loneliness where you feel a little off for a day. I’m talking about the kind that creeps into your life slowly. The kind where you realize you’re seeing your friends less, spending less time with loved ones, and swapping real connection for likes, notifications, and incredibly imbalanced parasocial relationships. 

According to United States Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, it’s a [full-blown epidemic.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html)

The [physical health consequences](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf) of poor or insufficient connection include a 29% increased risk of heart disease, a 32% increased risk of stroke, and a 50% increased risk of developing dementia for older adults. Additionally, lacking social connection increases risk of premature death by more than 60%.

And the data from Jonathan Haidt’s, [*The Anxious Generation* ](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036)(incredible book) backs it up. 

Back in 1980s, nearly half of high school seniors were meeting up with their friends every day. These numbers held fairly constant throughout the next 20 years.

But something dramatic happened towards the end of the 2000s. 

2010 marked the moment when smartphones truly took hold. The App Store was in full swing, and social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter were starting to explode. Suddenly, it became easier (and more addictive) to connect online than to make plans in person.

By 2020? That number dropped to just 28% for females and 31% for males. And it’s not just teens—across all age groups, the time people spend with friends has been tanking. We’re hanging out less, forming fewer close connections, and it’s starting to show.

And it’s not just teens—across all age groups, the time people spend with friends has been *tanking* since 2010. 

While social media usage is skyrocketing…

We’re hanging out less, forming fewer close connections, and it’s starting to show.

Meanwhile, in [*Blue Zones*](https://www.bluezones.com/)—places like Okinawa, Japan, and Sardinia, Italy—community is everything. These are the places where people live the longest and healthiest lives, and one of their key “secrets” isn’t diet or exercise. 

It’s human connection.

**People in these regions spend real, meaningful time with friends, family, and neighbors. And those relationships aren’t just nice to have—they’re literally saving their lives.**

Let’s contrast that with what’s happening here.

Social media promised us connection, but what it really gave us is a substitute. Instead of sitting across from a friend, we’re staring at a screen. We scroll through highlight reels instead of living our own. And while it feels like connection in the moment, it’s hollow.

And I don’t mean to fear-monger, but I can’t see a world in where this doesn’t get worse.

Not only are we spending less time with real people, but we’re starting to replace human relationships altogether.

Platforms like [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) are exploding in popularity, with users spending an average of[ 2 hours per day](https://qz.com/a-startup-founded-by-former-google-employees-claims-tha-1850919360) talking to virtual characters. 

[SocialAI](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247253/social-ai-app-replace-humans-with-bots) (which is *such* an ironic name because it’s the most dystopian, anti-social thing I’ve ever seen), allows you to create an entire Twitter-esque social feed where every person you interact with is a bot, there to agree with, argue against, support, love, and troll your every remark. 

Think about that: instead of grabbing coffee with a friend or calling a loved one, people are pouring hours into conversations with bots.

These AI bots are designed to ‘simulate connection’, offering companionship that feels “real” without any of the work. They don’t challenge you, they don’t misunderstand you, and they’re always available. 

And that’s the problem. Real relationships take effort. They require vulnerability, compromise, and navigating conflict. 

But when your ""relationship"" is powered by an algorithm, it’s tailored to give you exactly what you want—no mess, no misunderstandings, and no growth.

If the platform decides to update its system or tweak how the chatbot responds, that “relationship” changes overnight. Imagine building your emotional world around something that could vanish with a software update.

Unfortunately, it’s already had devastating consequences. Earlier this year, there was a heartbreaking story of a young man who reportedly took his own life after his interactions with [Character.Ai](http://character.ai/), who he had become deeply attached to (both emotionally and romantically), spiraled. 

Truly fucked up.

So, what’s the fix?

**It’s simpler than you think: prioritize connection. Call a friend. Meet up in person. Join a group, have dinner, or just go for a walk together. If you’re a parent, let your kids play without micromanaging every interaction. The small stuff—laughing over a meal, sharing a story, or just being present—adds up in ways that matter more than you realize**.

And when you do, pay attention to how it feels. 

I promise — no amount of likes, comments, shares or AI chatbot connection will be able to truly replicate that.

The goblin is quick in a meta that’s been shifting into midrange more often than not. It gets around a bunch and doesn’t need a lot to rack up wins. I recently top cut the Play to Win 7 with it, losing my first game of the day in the cut itself. (Mull to 5 for a T2 [Heartwood Storyteller] was praying as is) The deck has legs and back to back top cuts finishing the swiss as the #3 seed in the Commander and Coffee event and the #2 seed in Play to Win 7 (I was #1 for the first 4 rounds getting bumped down to 2nd after a win and in got past.) The deck is a blast to play and can put in win attempt after win attempt. If you’ve been thinking about playing something that you haven’t heard getting hyped up do it. Worst case you scrub out of the event, best case you win or draw your first 5 games on a deck and top cut a 100+ player event.

1j2ot1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1j2ot1b/the_woman_at_the_ren_faire/,The Woman at the Ren Faire,"When my girlfriend, Ella, recommended we go to the local renaissance faire I absolutely jumped on the idea. I hadn’t been since I was a kid, but I always remembered loving it. The cool venders, the food, the awesome jousting matches. It was everything a kid could love. My recent hyperfixation on medieval times and fantasy also definitely helped to drive my excitement for the event. I also had been needing a good excuse to get out and be social again. I had found myself too busy with school and work to get out and actually live.

Both of us called up a bunch of our friends and worked out a time for us to meet up there and enjoy the festivities. We even both ordered and threw together simple medieval costumes to wear to the event. I was so excited for the day that would lead to such torment.

The day itself was very eventful, enjoyable even. The ren faire was everything I hoped it would be and more. Everyone had a great time watching the shows, shopping, eating overpriced food, and playing games. I remember loving getting to have Ella holding my arm by my side the whole time. We had been together for some time now. She had become such a fixture in my life that I couldn’t imagine a world without her. While my time at the faire was spectacular, I had this weird feeling from the moment I walked through the gate that I was being watched.

After the first few minutes, I blew off the feeling, thinking it was ridiculous. I assumed I hadn’t been getting out enough. I had been too focused on my courses’ assignments and work and have pushed off being social. I figured the feeling was just a bit of social anxiety after being cooped up too long. I chose to ignore it and after a while, the feeling waned to near nothingness.

After the sun went down and the group was getting ready to leave, that was when I first saw her. A woman, probably in her mid-30s. I couldn’t explain why my eyes were drawn to her, she wasn’t dressed up or anything, she was in normal everyday street clothes. She was scanning the crowd intensely. Her expression was fixed with intensity. She looked over the crowd how I would expect a mother to look over a crowd after realizing she lost her child.

Her eyes met mine as she combed over the crowd and immediately the uneasy feeling at the start of the day came back worse than before. This time though, there was something more. A mix of dread and sadness crept into my mind as our eyes locked. The woman’s eyes widened with a more desperate look than before. I can’t explain it, but I felt hypnotized by the look she gave me until one of my friends spoke up,

 “So, are we getting out of here or what?”

 I looked away from the woman to my friend, who must have seen the uncomfortable look on my face.

“Woah. Mason, you alright?” he asked.

I looked back to the crowd, but the woman was gone and with her disappearance the uneasy feeling faded as well.

“Yeah. Sorry. Some lady was just staring at me really weird.” I said with a chuckle that tried masking discomfort. “Yeah, let’s get out of here.”

We all said our goodbyes in the parking area and went our separate ways. As Ella and I were making our way back to our truck, I heard a woman’s voice approaching from behind us.

“Excuse me? Sir? Sir!”

I turned around in time to see the woman from before approaching. It was darker in the parking area, but she was close enough that I could see what looked to be black beads in her hands.

“Yeah? How can I help you?” I asked.

 “For you.”

 She smiled, but her voice was monotone. The woman held out the black beads that I could now see made a necklace and was covered in what appeared to be white runes.

 I took Ella’s hand and continued walking to my truck while responding,

 “No thank you. I already spent enough money inside. I don’t need to spend anything else.”

She continued behind us, insisting.

“Please. Just try it on, sir.” She sounded more desperate now. “I think it will be good for you.”

I got Ella inside my truck and began walking to the driver’s side, trying to avoid eye contact with the strange woman and reaffirming that I wasn’t interested. I couldn’t explain it, but the woman being so close to me now was driving me insane. It was like my emotions were being gutted. The closer she got, the worse I felt. I wanted nothing more than to get away from her.

As I reached for the handle of my door, I saw the woman’s hand reach out and grab my arm before hearing her pleading,

“Please, sir, I know you don’t understand, but I need you to take this and wear it. There is-”

I pulled back my hand roughly and snapped, “Don’t you dare grab me like that you weirdo! I have no clue who the hell you are or why you want me to have your stupid Etsy project, but it’s not happening. Go find some other loser to sell your cheap junk to!”

It was as though her touch flipped a switch in me. The sadness, the gutted feeling, was replaced with anger that exploded out of me. I climbed into my truck and slammed the door. Immediately, I felt off about what I had said. Even in incredibly uncomfortable and less than favorable situations, I am always very calm and never aggressive or insulting to people. Ella, seeing how odd I acted and how upset I was, placed her hand on my arm,

“Let’s get home, ok?”

I nodded and began backing out of the parking space.

After backing out, I put my truck into drive and looked forward to now see the woman standing in the parking space we just pulled out of. In my headlights, I could see her clearly, clutching the black beads to her chest, with a face that looked like she hadn’t slept in days. As the light shined on her, I noticed something else that I hadn’t before: her eyes were filled with tears. As I looked into her sorrow-filled eyes, for a moment, I considered going and taking the necklace from her. However, this feeling was quickly replaced by the same abnormal anger I felt before.

“Crazy bitch.” I hissed under my breath before speeding off.

That night was the first night the dream came to me. The memory of it fragmented, nothing more than fading flashes. An empty void, a dark forest, a twig breaking behind me, turning to see what it was, and then waking up. Dreams are a strange thing, the memory of the dream was as though I had no feeling of fear, but upon waking from it, I was left in a cold sweat, breathing as though I had a near-death experience. I grabbed my phone and checked the time, 12 a.m. exactly.

Things started getting strange over the next few weeks. To say my luck was bad would be an understatement. It started off small, my phone would go missing only to find it a few hours later in a place I had already looked, glasses being too close to the edge of the counter and falling off, those sorts of things.

As time went on though, the misfortune became more serious. I’d get ready for work only to spend 30 minutes looking for my keys only to realize my wallet is now missing right after I found the keys, making me late and putting me in bad standings with my boss. I would go to submit an assignment for one of my college classes just to find the files I was using somehow got corrupted and I would have to start all over. I even had weird stuff like multiple birds flying into my windows and breaking their necks, something that always upset me as a big animal lover. These things happened sparsely in the first few weeks, but after the first month they became more frequent.

Every time these misfortunes would happen, I would feel anger and sadness welling up more and more. All of this was further fed by tiredness that came from being woken up every few days at exactly the same time by a dream that made no sense. Once those emotions subsided, I would be left with a growing emptiness in me. I’m ashamed to say it, but the stress and anger lead me to push everyone away. I suddenly had no time for friends and little time for Ella. When I was around the people I cared for I was left with this deflated feeling that made me a husk of the happy person I once was. After 2 months, I felt like I had become a completely different person.

I have never believed in the paranormal. I loved the idea of ghosts and spirits, but I never believed those things could actually exist. I chalked up what was happening to me as a string of bad luck mixed with mood swings from stress and lack of sleep. Ella was the first one to suggest something paranormal might be happening. Unlike me, Ella was actually open-minded to the idea of paranormal stuff and even believed in it to at least some extent. With my terrible luck and even worse mood, she wondered if I somehow got into something bad. I don’t know if she fully believed it herself or if she was grasping at anything to get her boyfriend back.

“There are a lot of things in this world that we can’t explain, and tons of people have encounters with things that they swear are otherworldly. What if something is messing with you?” Ella said, showing me an article on curses and hauntings.

I’m ashamed to say, but I laughed at her when she suggested it. I don’t know why I did it. I always try to hear her out on everything with an open mind, but hearing the paranormal suggested made something inside me stir. It was so out of character and mean-spirited of me, but I laughed at her

“Are you serious?” I asked sarcastically.

“Yes.”

“Ok, cool, what is it then? Was it Casper or the gnomes that kept hiding my keys?”

“I’m being serious.”

“No, you’re not.” my voice raised, “You are sitting here bringing up fairy tales and magic to explain to me why *everything* in my life sucks right now! All I want is to be left alone so I don’t have to listen to people make excuses for something that is just bad luck!”

It was a lie. I didn’t want her to go. “Why am I being such a jerk?” I thought.

“I’m just throwing out ideas. I’m trying to help you.” She said quietly.

“Well, at least I’m not the only one losing my mind.”

Immediately, I came to my senses about how awful I was being. I tried to apologize, but the damage was already done.

“If you want to be miserable, you can be,” Ella said, “but you don’t have to make everyone miserable with you.”

She stormed out while I tried backpedaling what I said, digging a hole deeper for myself.

When Ella slammed the door behind her, and I was alone in my house again, the sinking feeling of guilt was almost unbearable. I stood there for a few minutes, pacing around the kitchen, looking at my phone, debating if I should call her and try to make things right. Ella was the only person who was trying to help me, the only person who knew everything going on in my life, and I pushed her away for trying to be there for me.

“Why did you push her away?” I thought.

“You’re so pathetic. You let a little bad luck drive everyone you care about away. You’re worthless. Less than worthless. You would have more use in the ground than going on with this miserable excuse for a life.”

I had never been suicidal in my whole life. These thoughts… they were alien to me. Yet for a moment, they made sense. My head was flooded with images, all the ways I could do it. Feeling that way, hearing the voice in my head say these things, it was terrifying.

The depression and guilt I felt in that moment was almost unbearable. I put my phone back in my pocket and I fell on my hands and knees and sobbed. And there, in my sorrow, grief, and self-pity, I noticed something. The room… seemed darker.

No… not the whole room. Just a small area shadowed around me.

“What?” I gasped, looking at the strange shadow around me. It didn’t make any sense; I was lying right under the kitchen light. The only way there could be a shadow around me was if… someone was behind me blocking the light. Immediately, a feeling came to the forefront of my mind. One that I had been experiencing for weeks but was so faint, I didn’t even notice until now, I was being watched, and whoever it was is right behind me.

I spun around with my hands in front of me. I expected to see some person dressed in all black with a knife or gun, but instead, I was faced with nothing but the glaring light bulb of the kitchen light fixture. The shadow was gone, but the feeling of not being alone was stronger than ever. I shot to my feet, my still-wet eyes jittering around the room, looking for a sign of anyone.

“Who’s there!?” I shouted, trying to sound threatening even though whoever would have been there was just listening to me cry like a toddler.

“I’m not messing around! I know someone is here! Come out and face me!” I demand.

I really, *really* wish I hadn’t.

After I finished speaking, I heard something in my kitchen cabinet, the sound of glass breaking. At first, it was a small *crack. crack. crack*. Then I heard a glass shatter, then another. “What the hell,” I whispered in a shaking voice, frozen, unable to comprehend the impossibility of what was happening.

Suddenly, the cabinet flew open, and shreds of broken plates and glasses were thrown out towards me. I ducked when the cabinet door opened so most of the glass missed me, but a few shards managed to land on the top of me and left a few cuts on my scalp and arms. Immediately, I ran out of the kitchen and into my bedroom.

Even though I couldn’t see it, I could feel it, its presence, it was inches behind me as I ran. It was like I could feel heat radiating off of it as I ran through the entrance to my bedroom, slamming and locking the door. I moved inside the bathroom to find something to treat my cuts. I reached for my phone. I needed to call the police, to call Ella, to call anyone who could come and help me. My phone was gone. “What? No. No no…” I whimpered as I patted myself all over, looking for my phone. I had put it in my pocket; where the hell could it have gone?

As I looked over my bedroom for my phone, a loud thud came from my door, followed by another, and another. The thuds were getting louder, and I could see the door start to buckle and shake under weight of whatever was doing this. I knew whatever the thing was, it was going to get into the bedroom eventually. In my desperation, I locked myself in the bathroom with the lights turned off. I heard the bedroom door crack and then break open. The silence that followed the sound of the door breaking was maddening.

I couldn’t hear footsteps or breathing. I could see from under the door the light of the bedroom flicker before hearing the bulb shatter as I was drowned in complete darkness. The immersing silence was broken by the sound of the doorknob to the bathroom being tested gently, followed by three quiet taps.

“Please. I don’t know what you want. I don’t know what I did wrong. I’m sorry.” I cried softly, “Please. Just leave me alone. I just want you to leave me alone.” 

My pleads were met with the sound of something hitting the door hard before falling to the ground. At first, I wondered what it could have thrown at the door, but my question was answered a few minutes later as a familiar ringtone filled the quiet room. It was my phone. What’s more, the ringtone was a special ringtone I set up for when Ella calls me. The help I needed was calling me. All I had to do was open the door and answer. Maybe it was waiting right outside the door or maybe it had already left the room. There was no way for me to know. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t open that door. My help would have to wait. I bandaged myself up the best I could before I laid on the cold floor and cried until all the energy left my body and I somehow fell asleep. There, I dreamed.

I was falling, falling through a black void. I could see my body, but everything around me was as black as an empty night sky. I’ve never had a fear of heights, but I’ve never been the most comfortable around them either. Fear of the eventual sudden stop grew and grew as I plummeted. I screamed as I fell. I pictured my friends, my family, I pictured Ella. I didn’t want to die.

Suddenly, the rushing wind on my back and feeling of falling stopped. Replaced with the crunchy cushion of dead leaves and the chirping of crickets while I looked up at a forest canopy covering a bright night sky. It was as if I was never falling to begin with. I stood to my feet, the fear of the falling and the memory of the presence in my home still weighing on me. However, in the calm of the forest I remembered that I had been here before, almost every night. The falling, the forest, it has plagued my mind every day for weeks. Only this time, it was clearer, I had more understanding of where I was and that I was asleep on the bathroom floor.

*crunch*

I remembered this. A noise approaching from behind, one that if I turned to face, the dream would end, a mistake I didn’t want to make.

*crunch*

As the noise drew closer, my fear grew. However, the presence behind me had an air of calm, of peace, of comfort. It felt different from the thing I was running from moments ago.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked

*crunch*

“Please. Just let me go.” I cried, “I just want to be ok again.”

Behind me, I heard a voice, a voice from my memory that I had forgotten. A voice whose memory shot to the forefront of my mind.  The voice of the woman from the renaissance faire.

“Come find me.” She said sternly.

“How can I find you, Maria?”

 Maria? I knew her name. She never told it to me, but I knew it somehow.

“Come find me.” She said again.

I turned to face her only to wake up on the bathroom floor. I didn’t know how long I had been asleep for, but I needed to get out of the house. I needed to get to Ella. She could help me find Maria. I opened the bathroom door, picking up my phone and checking the time, 12:12 a.m. My room was a mess, my bedroom door was broken open, my pillows and bed were shredded. All the lamps and light bulbs in the room were broken, a pattern I assumed would spread throughout the house. As I moved out of the bedroom, I opened my phone to call Ella. She wouldn’t like being woken up, but she would understand. As I rounded the corner into my kitchen, I dropped my phone in the shock of what I saw. In my mind, I assumed this presence that was tormenting me was formless. Something that could physically affect things but not be seen. I don’t know why I thought this, but that assumption was dashed as I looked at the monster in front of me.

The thing stood between me and the door leading to the garage. It was tall enough to have to hunch over to stand in my kitchen, making it well over 8 feet tall. Despite its height, the being was unnaturally slender, having the same width dimensions of an average thin person. Its skin, if you can call it skin, was like ink. It looked wet and oily, a light from the street shimmered off of its black form. Its head was shaped similar to a bird's. It was round, with what looked like a hooked beak over what I can only assume is a wide gaping mouth with no teeth.

I turned to run, too afraid to even scream. Before I had even made three steps towards the back door, the creature had grabbed me. Its long, slender hands had wrapped around my head and pulled me back, forcing me onto my back. I could feel it now; its skin was slick and wet, like grabbing at latex covered in dish soap. It placed its hand in my mouth and forced it open. I could taste it, like the taste when you accidentally breathe in sunscreen mixed with cinnamon. Then I felt it, a pouring into my mouth. It was as though the thing was melting down my throat. I choked, I cried, but I couldn’t move. Even as the monster shrank and melted into me, I could still feel its strength holding me down. Eventually, the stress of the situation became too much, and I passed out.

When I woke up on the floor the next morning, I felt like I had the worst chest congestion possible. I jumped to my feet and coughed over the sink, coughing up a mixture of phlegm, blood, and a black oily substance. I called Ella and told her that I needed to see her in public right then. I told her that I was sorry for what I said and that she was right and that I needed her help more than ever. She could have said no, she could have called me crazy, but she didn’t. She just asked how she could help. I assumed the thing knew more people would get involved if it started throwing things around in public and since it waited until Ella left the other night before lashing out, I imagined it didn’t want more people involved. So, I figured being in public would be my best shot at keeping it restrained.

I met up with Ella at a coffee shop and explained everything to her: the cuts, the dream, what the thing did to me. I don’t think she fully believed me at first, but her mind changed when I coughed up the strange black liquid into a napkin.

“I think it’s trying to break me down,” I said.

“Why? What does it need you broken down for?”

“I have no clue, but it’s working. I’m not myself anymore, even you’ve noticed that.”

Ella sipped her coffee, “And how do you feel now?”

“Terrible.”

“How so?”

“It makes me want to die.”

“What?” Ella’s eyes widened, setting her coffee down.

“Yeah. Like when you left the other night. I think the thing was trying to convince me to…” I hung my head. Unable to finish the sentence.

“What about that woman?” Ella asked.

“Maria? I don’t know. She has been there since it started, though.” I answered.

“Do you think she could have started all this?”

“Maybe. Or maybe she wants to stop it. All I know is that she wants me to find her. So that is what we’re going to do.”

It took a while of scouring Facebook and Instagram before we found her, turns out there are a lot of Marias in my area. But eventually, there she was, Maria Windsor. Her page was filled with spiritualist crafts and inspirational messages. She looked happier in her pictures than how I remembered seeing her, but it was her. I sent her a friend request and within a few minutes she accepted and sent a message. It was an address with the words, “Get here quickly.”

When we arrived at the address, we saw it was just an ordinary house in a completely unassuming neighborhood. Despite its unassuming nature, the thing that had latched onto me did not like me being there. The coughing was getting worse and worse the closer I got to the house. Walking up to her front door was an ordeal in and of itself. Eventually, I stopped at the steps to the door. I couldn’t catch my breath; I couldn’t stop coughing and spitting up that vile black liquid. At a certain point, I questioned if this was how I would die, on the doorstep of a mystery I would never understand. As my vision started to go dark, I saw the door to the house open and the fuzzy image of a woman approaching me.

When I came to, I was lying on a couch with Ella staring at me from across the room with a worried expression. Sitting on the coffee table in front of me was Maria.

“It’s nice to see you again, Mason,” Maria said with a small smile.

“Maria..?” I groaned, still waking up.

“Here, drink this.” She said, handing me a glass of water.

I sat up and took the water from her. It was then that I noticed the necklace of black beads around my neck.

“You got here just in time. Any later and it would have started fully taking you.” Maria said, her voice very matter of fact and direct.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Some say evil spirit, some say demon. It’s something non-human, not from our plane. Something that hates us.”

“Us?” I asked.

“Humans.” She replied quickly. “It hates people.”

“Why?”

Maria shrugged, “Who knows. It could be a number of reasons, but *it* and things like it don’t usually speak to us candidly with people.”

“What does it want?” I asked quietly.

“Your death.” Her words cut me like a knife.

I looked around the rooms. It was filled with oddities like crystals, incense burners, sigils, herbs, and different colored strings. I could also see religious paraphernalia scattered throughout the room, things like crucifixes, rosary beads, and what I assume was holy water.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Someone who wants to help you.”

“But why?”

“Because I know what it’s like to lose someone to this thing. And I don’t want to see anyone else suffer because of it.” Maria looked at Ella, who was clearly still shaken up from what had happened on the doorstep.

I reached up and touched the necklace. I could almost feel warmth radiating off of it.

“This wards it off,” I muttered. “That’s why you were trying to give it to me?”

Maria frowned, “It would have. But judging by the black shit you’re coughing up I’m going to go out on a limb and say the thing has already infested you. At this point, all it does is weaken it.”

“How did you reach me in my dream?” I asked.

“Astral projection.” She said. “I tried almost every night to reach you. The problem is the spirit is a strong one and it would block our link. Your girlfriend filled me in on the night I was able to reach you. My guess, the spirit used up too much energy torturing you and it wasn’t strong enough to block the link.”

“What can we do to fix this?” I asked.

“At this point,” Maria said, “The spirit is too close to taking you over. We’re going to have to get it out of you by force.”

I had seen and heard of exorcisms in all sorts of fictional media. I never believed it was a real thing, let alone that one day I would be the one strapped to a table shirtless with what I can only assume is a witch and my girlfriend standing around me. The room was decorated with more oddities than the living room was. The two doors in and out of the room had ornate crucifixes hanging over them and the whole room was lined with red string. The shelves in the room were covered in bottles filled with different herbs and spices, and the edges of the floor were covered in a pristine line of salt.

“This will be a very unpleasant experience for you,” Maria said somberly. “Your mind will be taken closer to the spirit’s world. You will see and feel things that are imperceivable to us. It will be a lot to take in. But that is why it is good that she’s here.” Maria said this while looking at Ella. “She’ll keep you grounded.”

Despite the gravity of the words Maria was speaking to me, her cadence and delivery were like that of a doctor describing an invasive surgery to a patient. She spoke like she had done this many times before.

I squeezed Ella’s hand. “I’m ready.”

Maria winced in a way that told me I wasn’t.

“Then let’s begin.” She said calmly.

Maria began to burn incense and chant quietly in a language that I couldn’t understand. I gave Ella a worried glance just before the smell of the incense accosted my nose. Neither Maria nor Ella reacted to the smell, but to me, it reeked of rot and spoiled milk. I could feel its smoke burning in my lungs. The smell was accompanied by an equally strange sight. The room suddenly looked as though everything was completely covered in shadow. It reminded me of when your phone is on, but you don’t touch it for a long time and the screen goes dim before turning off. The sight and smell were enough to freak me out. I was breathing heavily and squeezed Ella’s hand tighter as she looked down at me with a nervous stare.

After a few minutes of this, I began to feel a stirring in my chest. I needed to cough, but I couldn't sit up to cough the mess in my lungs out of me. Then I felt it, a pressing on my chest. When I looked down though, I realized it wasn’t something pressing on my chest, it was something inside of my chest pressing out. I could feel the subtle touch of fingertips rubbing against the inside of my ribcage. “What the hell is that!?” I whispered. Maria continued her chanting, and Ella just squeezed my hand, looking at the spot on my chest that I was looking.

I could now feel what felt like the palm of someone’s hand pushing up on my ribcage. The discomfort it caused was unnatural. I lurched on the table and let out a yell. Maria’s chants grew louder as Ella stumbled back, frightened by my screams. I looked down to now see several small pointy objects pushing out the skin between my ribs. I screamed out and looked away as black inky fingertips broke through the skin with a hideous pop, I could feel small streams of liquid streaming down my sides. The strangest thing was that, despite feeling the pressure, there was no pain coming from the wounds, only the mental anguish from watching my own body’s mutilation. I watched in horror as the fingers retreated back into my chest as I felt two palms now pressing up on the inside of my chest. After a few more moments of hearing nothing but my screaming and Maria’s chanting a new horrifying sound came to my ears, cracking.

I could hear my ribs breaking inside of me as the pushing continued. I couldn’t bear to look down as I heard the tearing of my skin, sounding like dull knives going through wet leather. I looked around the room in panicked agony to see Maria and Ella with sprays of my blood across them. However, Maria kept chanting and Ella stayed still. As I felt my chest open more, I could also now feel something much bigger than hands pushing through.

I looked down just in time to see the head and shoulders of the spirit push from my mangled torso with an awful screech, my crimson blood running off its shining black exterior. Its piercing cry made my ears ring out in pain, the first true pain I had felt since the exorcism began. The pain from the demon’s scream worked its way down my body. It was as though it woke up a part of me so I could now feel the pain radiating from the damage it had done to my chest. I closed my eyes and screamed out in pain, begging for the anguish to stop, wondering if there was any way out. When I opened my eyes, the being was bent down over me, half of its body still submerged in me. its abominable head just inches from mine. I could feel its offer running through my soul. It would take the pain away, it would end the suffering, all it wanted was for me to give it control.

For a moment, I wanted to say yes. I wanted to end this nightmare. To get away from everything. Death was preferable to me than this. I tensed my mouth, prepared to scream my answer, to let it know that it had won; to let it know it had broken me. Then, in all the pain and agony, I felt a familiar warm hand gently grab my arm. I looked to see Ella, with tears streaming down her face, knelt down beside me and speaking softly to me. “Keep going. Please.” She said through broken cries. “I need you to keep going for me. I love you, Mason.” As I looked into her eyes, for just a moment, I felt the pain leave and a calmness wash over me. In that brief moment, I mustered the strength to whisper four simple words, “I want to live.”  I screamed out a cry of pain as the demon trashed back and screeched at my answer, the rest of its torso and legs forming from the black sludge that filled my chest. I watched as the spirit rose up out of me and dissipated into black mist in the air. My vision grew dark, and I watched the world go black.

As I shot upright on the couch, my hands instinctively went to my chest. I could feel my heart beating quickly against my perfectly intact ribs, no dried blood or scars in sight. I looked up, confused, just in time to see a sobbing Ella jump on me and hugged me so tightly that I struggled to breathe.

“You did good,” Maria said, sipping what looked like tea from across the room.

I struggled to speak “I… I saw it… It ripped… How am I...”

“What you saw and felt was the purging of your spirit. Things that we couldn’t perceive. To us, you were just thrashing and screaming”

“So, it’s really gone?” Ella asked.

“For him it is,” Maria sighed. “Unfortunately, keeping something like that out of our plane permanently is much more difficult.”

“Thank you, Maria,” I muttered.

Maria nodded and went back into her kitchen.

For the most part, life went back to normal after that. I had to really patch things up with my boss and push myself like crazy to catch back up in school, but I managed, especially with Ella and my friends by my side. I could have given up. I could have let it win. But I didn’t. I pushed forward and found hope. Hope in the ones I love, and the ones that love me.

If somehow, somewhere, there is someone out there reading this who is fighting this evil spirit, *keep fighting*. And if you run into some lady who is offering you strange black beads, for the love of God, *take them*.",1,1741024636.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

1j2oqz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1j2oqz6/the_woman_at_the_ren_faire/,The Woman at the Ren Faire,"When my girlfriend, Ella, recommended we go to the local renaissance faire I absolutely jumped on the idea. I hadn’t been since I was a kid, but I always remembered loving it. The cool venders, the food, the awesome jousting matches. It was everything a kid could love. My recent hyperfixation on medieval times and fantasy also definitely helped to drive my excitement for the event. I also had been needing a good excuse to get out and be social again. I had found myself too busy with school and work to get out and actually live.

Both of us called up a bunch of our friends and worked out a time for us to meet up there and enjoy the festivities. We even both ordered and threw together simple medieval costumes to wear to the event. I was so excited for the day that would lead to such torment.

The day itself was very eventful, enjoyable even. The ren faire was everything I hoped it would be and more. Everyone had a great time watching the shows, shopping, eating overpriced food, and playing games. I remember loving getting to have Ella holding my arm by my side the whole time. We had been together for some time now. She had become such a fixture in my life that I couldn’t imagine a world without her. While my time at the faire was spectacular, I had this weird feeling from the moment I walked through the gate that I was being watched.

After the first few minutes, I blew off the feeling, thinking it was ridiculous. I assumed I hadn’t been getting out enough. I had been too focused on my courses’ assignments and work and have pushed off being social. I figured the feeling was just a bit of social anxiety after being cooped up too long. I chose to ignore it and after a while, the feeling waned to near nothingness.

After the sun went down and the group was getting ready to leave, that was when I first saw her. A woman, probably in her mid-30s. I couldn’t explain why my eyes were drawn to her, she wasn’t dressed up or anything, she was in normal everyday street clothes. She was scanning the crowd intensely. Her expression was fixed with intensity. She looked over the crowd how I would expect a mother to look over a crowd after realizing she lost her child.

Her eyes met mine as she combed over the crowd and immediately the uneasy feeling at the start of the day came back worse than before. This time though, there was something more. A mix of dread and sadness crept into my mind as our eyes locked. The woman’s eyes widened with a more desperate look than before. I can’t explain it, but I felt hypnotized by the look she gave me until one of my friends spoke up,

 “So, are we getting out of here or what?”

 I looked away from the woman to my friend, who must have seen the uncomfortable look on my face.

“Woah. Mason, you alright?” he asked.

I looked back to the crowd, but the woman was gone and with her disappearance the uneasy feeling faded as well.

“Yeah. Sorry. Some lady was just staring at me really weird.” I said with a chuckle that tried masking discomfort. “Yeah, let’s get out of here.”

We all said our goodbyes in the parking area and went our separate ways. As Ella and I were making our way back to our truck, I heard a woman’s voice approaching from behind us.

“Excuse me? Sir? Sir!”

I turned around in time to see the woman from before approaching. It was darker in the parking area, but she was close enough that I could see what looked to be black beads in her hands.

“Yeah? How can I help you?” I asked.

 “For you.”

 She smiled, but her voice was monotone. The woman held out the black beads that I could now see made a necklace and was covered in what appeared to be white runes.

 I took Ella’s hand and continued walking to my truck while responding,

 “No thank you. I already spent enough money inside. I don’t need to spend anything else.”

She continued behind us, insisting.

“Please. Just try it on, sir.” She sounded more desperate now. “I think it will be good for you.”

I got Ella inside my truck and began walking to the driver’s side, trying to avoid eye contact with the strange woman and reaffirming that I wasn’t interested. I couldn’t explain it, but the woman being so close to me now was driving me insane. It was like my emotions were being gutted. The closer she got, the worse I felt. I wanted nothing more than to get away from her.

As I reached for the handle of my door, I saw the woman’s hand reach out and grab my arm before hearing her pleading,

“Please, sir, I know you don’t understand, but I need you to take this and wear it. There is-”

I pulled back my hand roughly and snapped, “Don’t you dare grab me like that you weirdo! I have no clue who the hell you are or why you want me to have your stupid Etsy project, but it’s not happening. Go find some other loser to sell your cheap junk to!”

It was as though her touch flipped a switch in me. The sadness, the gutted feeling, was replaced with anger that exploded out of me. I climbed into my truck and slammed the door. Immediately, I felt off about what I had said. Even in incredibly uncomfortable and less than favorable situations, I am always very calm and never aggressive or insulting to people. Ella, seeing how odd I acted and how upset I was, placed her hand on my arm,

“Let’s get home, ok?”

I nodded and began backing out of the parking space.

After backing out, I put my truck into drive and looked forward to now see the woman standing in the parking space we just pulled out of. In my headlights, I could see her clearly, clutching the black beads to her chest, with a face that looked like she hadn’t slept in days. As the light shined on her, I noticed something else that I hadn’t before: her eyes were filled with tears. As I looked into her sorrow-filled eyes, for a moment, I considered going and taking the necklace from her. However, this feeling was quickly replaced by the same abnormal anger I felt before.

“Crazy bitch.” I hissed under my breath before speeding off.

That night was the first night the dream came to me. The memory of it fragmented, nothing more than fading flashes. An empty void, a dark forest, a twig breaking behind me, turning to see what it was, and then waking up. Dreams are a strange thing, the memory of the dream was as though I had no feeling of fear, but upon waking from it, I was left in a cold sweat, breathing as though I had a near-death experience. I grabbed my phone and checked the time, 12 a.m. exactly.

Things started getting strange over the next few weeks. To say my luck was bad would be an understatement. It started off small, my phone would go missing only to find it a few hours later in a place I had already looked, glasses being too close to the edge of the counter and falling off, those sorts of things.

As time went on though, the misfortune became more serious. I’d get ready for work only to spend 30 minutes looking for my keys only to realize my wallet is now missing right after I found the keys, making me late and putting me in bad standings with my boss. I would go to submit an assignment for one of my college classes just to find the files I was using somehow got corrupted and I would have to start all over. I even had weird stuff like multiple birds flying into my windows and breaking their necks, something that always upset me as a big animal lover. These things happened sparsely in the first few weeks, but after the first month they became more frequent.

Every time these misfortunes would happen, I would feel anger and sadness welling up more and more. All of this was further fed by tiredness that came from being woken up every few days at exactly the same time by a dream that made no sense. Once those emotions subsided, I would be left with a growing emptiness in me. I’m ashamed to say it, but the stress and anger lead me to push everyone away. I suddenly had no time for friends and little time for Ella. When I was around the people I cared for I was left with this deflated feeling that made me a husk of the happy person I once was. After 2 months, I felt like I had become a completely different person.

I have never believed in the paranormal. I loved the idea of ghosts and spirits, but I never believed those things could actually exist. I chalked up what was happening to me as a string of bad luck mixed with mood swings from stress and lack of sleep. Ella was the first one to suggest something paranormal might be happening. Unlike me, Ella was actually open-minded to the idea of paranormal stuff and even believed in it to at least some extent. With my terrible luck and even worse mood, she wondered if I somehow got into something bad. I don’t know if she fully believed it herself or if she was grasping at anything to get her boyfriend back.

“There are a lot of things in this world that we can’t explain, and tons of people have encounters with things that they swear are otherworldly. What if something is messing with you?” Ella said, showing me an article on curses and hauntings.

I’m ashamed to say, but I laughed at her when she suggested it. I don’t know why I did it. I always try to hear her out on everything with an open mind, but hearing the paranormal suggested made something inside me stir. It was so out of character and mean-spirited of me, but I laughed at her

“Are you serious?” I asked sarcastically.

“Yes.”

“Ok, cool, what is it then? Was it Casper or the gnomes that kept hiding my keys?”

“I’m being serious.”

“No, you’re not.” my voice raised, “You are sitting here bringing up fairy tales and magic to explain to me why *everything* in my life sucks right now! All I want is to be left alone so I don’t have to listen to people make excuses for something that is just bad luck!”

It was a lie. I didn’t want her to go. “Why am I being such a jerk?” I thought.

“I’m just throwing out ideas. I’m trying to help you.” She said quietly.

“Well, at least I’m not the only one losing my mind.”

Immediately, I came to my senses about how awful I was being. I tried to apologize, but the damage was already done.

“If you want to be miserable, you can be,” Ella said, “but you don’t have to make everyone miserable with you.”

She stormed out while I tried backpedaling what I said, digging a hole deeper for myself.

When Ella slammed the door behind her, and I was alone in my house again, the sinking feeling of guilt was almost unbearable. I stood there for a few minutes, pacing around the kitchen, looking at my phone, debating if I should call her and try to make things right. Ella was the only person who was trying to help me, the only person who knew everything going on in my life, and I pushed her away for trying to be there for me.

“Why did you push her away?” I thought.

“You’re so pathetic. You let a little bad luck drive everyone you care about away. You’re worthless. Less than worthless. You would have more use in the ground than going on with this miserable excuse for a life.”

I had never been suicidal in my whole life. These thoughts… they were alien to me. Yet for a moment, they made sense. My head was flooded with images, all the ways I could do it. Feeling that way, hearing the voice in my head say these things, it was terrifying.

The depression and guilt I felt in that moment was almost unbearable. I put my phone back in my pocket and I fell on my hands and knees and sobbed. And there, in my sorrow, grief, and self-pity, I noticed something. The room… seemed darker.

No… not the whole room. Just a small area shadowed around me.

“What?” I gasped, looking at the strange shadow around me. It didn’t make any sense; I was lying right under the kitchen light. The only way there could be a shadow around me was if… someone was behind me blocking the light. Immediately, a feeling came to the forefront of my mind. One that I had been experiencing for weeks but was so faint, I didn’t even notice until now, I was being watched, and whoever it was is right behind me.

I spun around with my hands in front of me. I expected to see some person dressed in all black with a knife or gun, but instead, I was faced with nothing but the glaring light bulb of the kitchen light fixture. The shadow was gone, but the feeling of not being alone was stronger than ever. I shot to my feet, my still-wet eyes jittering around the room, looking for a sign of anyone.

“Who’s there!?” I shouted, trying to sound threatening even though whoever would have been there was just listening to me cry like a toddler.

“I’m not messing around! I know someone is here! Come out and face me!” I demand.

I really, *really* wish I hadn’t.

After I finished speaking, I heard something in my kitchen cabinet, the sound of glass breaking. At first, it was a small *crack. crack. crack*. Then I heard a glass shatter, then another. “What the hell,” I whispered in a shaking voice, frozen, unable to comprehend the impossibility of what was happening.

Suddenly, the cabinet flew open, and shreds of broken plates and glasses were thrown out towards me. I ducked when the cabinet door opened so most of the glass missed me, but a few shards managed to land on the top of me and left a few cuts on my scalp and arms. Immediately, I ran out of the kitchen and into my bedroom.

Even though I couldn’t see it, I could feel it, its presence, it was inches behind me as I ran. It was like I could feel heat radiating off of it as I ran through the entrance to my bedroom, slamming and locking the door. I moved inside the bathroom to find something to treat my cuts. I reached for my phone. I needed to call the police, to call Ella, to call anyone who could come and help me. My phone was gone. “What? No. No no…” I whimpered as I patted myself all over, looking for my phone. I had put it in my pocket; where the hell could it have gone?

As I looked over my bedroom for my phone, a loud thud came from my door, followed by another, and another. The thuds were getting louder, and I could see the door start to buckle and shake under weight of whatever was doing this. I knew whatever the thing was, it was going to get into the bedroom eventually. In my desperation, I locked myself in the bathroom with the lights turned off. I heard the bedroom door crack and then break open. The silence that followed the sound of the door breaking was maddening.

I couldn’t hear footsteps or breathing. I could see from under the door the light of the bedroom flicker before hearing the bulb shatter as I was drowned in complete darkness. The immersing silence was broken by the sound of the doorknob to the bathroom being tested gently, followed by three quiet taps.

“Please. I don’t know what you want. I don’t know what I did wrong. I’m sorry.” I cried softly, “Please. Just leave me alone. I just want you to leave me alone.” 

My pleads were met with the sound of something hitting the door hard before falling to the ground. At first, I wondered what it could have thrown at the door, but my question was answered a few minutes later as a familiar ringtone filled the quiet room. It was my phone. What’s more, the ringtone was a special ringtone I set up for when Ella calls me. The help I needed was calling me. All I had to do was open the door and answer. Maybe it was waiting right outside the door or maybe it had already left the room. There was no way for me to know. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t open that door. My help would have to wait. I bandaged myself up the best I could before I laid on the cold floor and cried until all the energy left my body and I somehow fell asleep. There, I dreamed.

I was falling, falling through a black void. I could see my body, but everything around me was as black as an empty night sky. I’ve never had a fear of heights, but I’ve never been the most comfortable around them either. Fear of the eventual sudden stop grew and grew as I plummeted. I screamed as I fell. I pictured my friends, my family, I pictured Ella. I didn’t want to die.

Suddenly, the rushing wind on my back and feeling of falling stopped. Replaced with the crunchy cushion of dead leaves and the chirping of crickets while I looked up at a forest canopy covering a bright night sky. It was as if I was never falling to begin with. I stood to my feet, the fear of the falling and the memory of the presence in my home still weighing on me. However, in the calm of the forest I remembered that I had been here before, almost every night. The falling, the forest, it has plagued my mind every day for weeks. Only this time, it was clearer, I had more understanding of where I was and that I was asleep on the bathroom floor.

*crunch*

I remembered this. A noise approaching from behind, one that if I turned to face, the dream would end, a mistake I didn’t want to make.

*crunch*

As the noise drew closer, my fear grew. However, the presence behind me had an air of calm, of peace, of comfort. It felt different from the thing I was running from moments ago.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked

*crunch*

“Please. Just let me go.” I cried, “I just want to be ok again.”

Behind me, I heard a voice, a voice from my memory that I had forgotten. A voice whose memory shot to the forefront of my mind.  The voice of the woman from the renaissance faire.

“Come find me.” She said sternly.

“How can I find you, Maria?”

 Maria? I knew her name. She never told it to me, but I knew it somehow.

“Come find me.” She said again.

I turned to face her only to wake up on the bathroom floor. I didn’t know how long I had been asleep for, but I needed to get out of the house. I needed to get to Ella. She could help me find Maria. I opened the bathroom door, picking up my phone and checking the time, 12:12 a.m. My room was a mess, my bedroom door was broken open, my pillows and bed were shredded. All the lamps and light bulbs in the room were broken, a pattern I assumed would spread throughout the house. As I moved out of the bedroom, I opened my phone to call Ella. She wouldn’t like being woken up, but she would understand. As I rounded the corner into my kitchen, I dropped my phone in the shock of what I saw. In my mind, I assumed this presence that was tormenting me was formless. Something that could physically affect things but not be seen. I don’t know why I thought this, but that assumption was dashed as I looked at the monster in front of me.

The thing stood between me and the door leading to the garage. It was tall enough to have to hunch over to stand in my kitchen, making it well over 8 feet tall. Despite its height, the being was unnaturally slender, having the same width dimensions of an average thin person. Its skin, if you can call it skin, was like ink. It looked wet and oily, a light from the street shimmered off of its black form. Its head was shaped similar to a bird's. It was round, with what looked like a hooked beak over what I can only assume is a wide gaping mouth with no teeth.

I turned to run, too afraid to even scream. Before I had even made three steps towards the back door, the creature had grabbed me. Its long, slender hands had wrapped around my head and pulled me back, forcing me onto my back. I could feel it now; its skin was slick and wet, like grabbing at latex covered in dish soap. It placed its hand in my mouth and forced it open. I could taste it, like the taste when you accidentally breathe in sunscreen mixed with cinnamon. Then I felt it, a pouring into my mouth. It was as though the thing was melting down my throat. I choked, I cried, but I couldn’t move. Even as the monster shrank and melted into me, I could still feel its strength holding me down. Eventually, the stress of the situation became too much, and I passed out.

When I woke up on the floor the next morning, I felt like I had the worst chest congestion possible. I jumped to my feet and coughed over the sink, coughing up a mixture of phlegm, blood, and a black oily substance. I called Ella and told her that I needed to see her in public right then. I told her that I was sorry for what I said and that she was right and that I needed her help more than ever. She could have said no, she could have called me crazy, but she didn’t. She just asked how she could help. I assumed the thing knew more people would get involved if it started throwing things around in public and since it waited until Ella left the other night before lashing out, I imagined it didn’t want more people involved. So, I figured being in public would be my best shot at keeping it restrained.

I met up with Ella at a coffee shop and explained everything to her: the cuts, the dream, what the thing did to me. I don’t think she fully believed me at first, but her mind changed when I coughed up the strange black liquid into a napkin.

“I think it’s trying to break me down,” I said.

“Why? What does it need you broken down for?”

“I have no clue, but it’s working. I’m not myself anymore, even you’ve noticed that.”

Ella sipped her coffee, “And how do you feel now?”

“Terrible.”

“How so?”

“It makes me want to die.”

“What?” Ella’s eyes widened, setting her coffee down.

“Yeah. Like when you left the other night. I think the thing was trying to convince me to…” I hung my head. Unable to finish the sentence.

“What about that woman?” Ella asked.

“Maria? I don’t know. She has been there since it started, though.” I answered.

“Do you think she could have started all this?”

“Maybe. Or maybe she wants to stop it. All I know is that she wants me to find her. So that is what we’re going to do.”

It took a while of scouring Facebook and Instagram before we found her, turns out there are a lot of Marias in my area. But eventually, there she was, Maria Windsor. Her page was filled with spiritualist crafts and inspirational messages. She looked happier in her pictures than how I remembered seeing her, but it was her. I sent her a friend request and within a few minutes she accepted and sent a message. It was an address with the words, “Get here quickly.”

When we arrived at the address, we saw it was just an ordinary house in a completely unassuming neighborhood. Despite its unassuming nature, the thing that had latched onto me did not like me being there. The coughing was getting worse and worse the closer I got to the house. Walking up to her front door was an ordeal in and of itself. Eventually, I stopped at the steps to the door. I couldn’t catch my breath; I couldn’t stop coughing and spitting up that vile black liquid. At a certain point, I questioned if this was how I would die, on the doorstep of a mystery I would never understand. As my vision started to go dark, I saw the door to the house open and the fuzzy image of a woman approaching me.

When I came to, I was lying on a couch with Ella staring at me from across the room with a worried expression. Sitting on the coffee table in front of me was Maria.

“It’s nice to see you again, Mason,” Maria said with a small smile.

“Maria..?” I groaned, still waking up.

“Here, drink this.” She said, handing me a glass of water.

I sat up and took the water from her. It was then that I noticed the necklace of black beads around my neck.

“You got here just in time. Any later and it would have started fully taking you.” Maria said, her voice very matter of fact and direct.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Some say evil spirit, some say demon. It’s something non-human, not from our plane. Something that hates us.”

“Us?” I asked.

“Humans.” She replied quickly. “It hates people.”

“Why?”

Maria shrugged, “Who knows. It could be a number of reasons, but *it* and things like it don’t usually speak to us candidly with people.”

“What does it want?” I asked quietly.

“Your death.” Her words cut me like a knife.

I looked around the rooms. It was filled with oddities like crystals, incense burners, sigils, herbs, and different colored strings. I could also see religious paraphernalia scattered throughout the room, things like crucifixes, rosary beads, and what I assume was holy water.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Someone who wants to help you.”

“But why?”

“Because I know what it’s like to lose someone to this thing. And I don’t want to see anyone else suffer because of it.” Maria looked at Ella, who was clearly still shaken up from what had happened on the doorstep.

I reached up and touched the necklace. I could almost feel warmth radiating off of it.

“This wards it off,” I muttered. “That’s why you were trying to give it to me?”

Maria frowned, “It would have. But judging by the black shit you’re coughing up I’m going to go out on a limb and say the thing has already infested you. At this point, all it does is weaken it.”

“How did you reach me in my dream?” I asked.

“Astral projection.” She said. “I tried almost every night to reach you. The problem is the spirit is a strong one and it would block our link. Your girlfriend filled me in on the night I was able to reach you. My guess, the spirit used up too much energy torturing you and it wasn’t strong enough to block the link.”

“What can we do to fix this?” I asked.

“At this point,” Maria said, “The spirit is too close to taking you over. We’re going to have to get it out of you by force.”

I had seen and heard of exorcisms in all sorts of fictional media. I never believed it was a real thing, let alone that one day I would be the one strapped to a table shirtless with what I can only assume is a witch and my girlfriend standing around me. The room was decorated with more oddities than the living room was. The two doors in and out of the room had ornate crucifixes hanging over them and the whole room was lined with red string. The shelves in the room were covered in bottles filled with different herbs and spices, and the edges of the floor were covered in a pristine line of salt.

“This will be a very unpleasant experience for you,” Maria said somberly. “Your mind will be taken closer to the spirit’s world. You will see and feel things that are imperceivable to us. It will be a lot to take in. But that is why it is good that she’s here.” Maria said this while looking at Ella. “She’ll keep you grounded.”

Despite the gravity of the words Maria was speaking to me, her cadence and delivery were like that of a doctor describing an invasive surgery to a patient. She spoke like she had done this many times before.

I squeezed Ella’s hand. “I’m ready.”

Maria winced in a way that told me I wasn’t.

“Then let’s begin.” She said calmly.

Maria began to burn incense and chant quietly in a language that I couldn’t understand. I gave Ella a worried glance just before the smell of the incense accosted my nose. Neither Maria nor Ella reacted to the smell, but to me, it reeked of rot and spoiled milk. I could feel its smoke burning in my lungs. The smell was accompanied by an equally strange sight. The room suddenly looked as though everything was completely covered in shadow. It reminded me of when your phone is on, but you don’t touch it for a long time and the screen goes dim before turning off. The sight and smell were enough to freak me out. I was breathing heavily and squeezed Ella’s hand tighter as she looked down at me with a nervous stare.

After a few minutes of this, I began to feel a stirring in my chest. I needed to cough, but I couldn't sit up to cough the mess in my lungs out of me. Then I felt it, a pressing on my chest. When I looked down though, I realized it wasn’t something pressing on my chest, it was something inside of my chest pressing out. I could feel the subtle touch of fingertips rubbing against the inside of my ribcage. “What the hell is that!?” I whispered. Maria continued her chanting, and Ella just squeezed my hand, looking at the spot on my chest that I was looking.

I could now feel what felt like the palm of someone’s hand pushing up on my ribcage. The discomfort it caused was unnatural. I lurched on the table and let out a yell. Maria’s chants grew louder as Ella stumbled back, frightened by my screams. I looked down to now see several small pointy objects pushing out the skin between my ribs. I screamed out and looked away as black inky fingertips broke through the skin with a hideous pop, I could feel small streams of liquid streaming down my sides. The strangest thing was that, despite feeling the pressure, there was no pain coming from the wounds, only the mental anguish from watching my own body’s mutilation. I watched in horror as the fingers retreated back into my chest as I felt two palms now pressing up on the inside of my chest. After a few more moments of hearing nothing but my screaming and Maria’s chanting a new horrifying sound came to my ears, cracking.

I could hear my ribs breaking inside of me as the pushing continued. I couldn’t bear to look down as I heard the tearing of my skin, sounding like dull knives going through wet leather. I looked around the room in panicked agony to see Maria and Ella with sprays of my blood across them. However, Maria kept chanting and Ella stayed still. As I felt my chest open more, I could also now feel something much bigger than hands pushing through.

I looked down just in time to see the head and shoulders of the spirit push from my mangled torso with an awful screech, my crimson blood running off its shining black exterior. Its piercing cry made my ears ring out in pain, the first true pain I had felt since the exorcism began. The pain from the demon’s scream worked its way down my body. It was as though it woke up a part of me so I could now feel the pain radiating from the damage it had done to my chest. I closed my eyes and screamed out in pain, begging for the anguish to stop, wondering if there was any way out. When I opened my eyes, the being was bent down over me, half of its body still submerged in me. its abominable head just inches from mine. I could feel its offer running through my soul. It would take the pain away, it would end the suffering, all it wanted was for me to give it control.

For a moment, I wanted to say yes. I wanted to end this nightmare. To get away from everything. Death was preferable to me than this. I tensed my mouth, prepared to scream my answer, to let it know that it had won; to let it know it had broken me. Then, in all the pain and agony, I felt a familiar warm hand gently grab my arm. I looked to see Ella, with tears streaming down her face, knelt down beside me and speaking softly to me. “Keep going. Please.” She said through broken cries. “I need you to keep going for me. I love you, Mason.” As I looked into her eyes, for just a moment, I felt the pain leave and a calmness wash over me. In that brief moment, I mustered the strength to whisper four simple words, “I want to live.”  I screamed out a cry of pain as the demon trashed back and screeched at my answer, the rest of its torso and legs forming from the black sludge that filled my chest. I watched as the spirit rose up out of me and dissipated into black mist in the air. My vision grew dark, and I watched the world go black.

As I shot upright on the couch, my hands instinctively went to my chest. I could feel my heart beating quickly against my perfectly intact ribs, no dried blood or scars in sight. I looked up, confused, just in time to see a sobbing Ella jump on me and hugged me so tightly that I struggled to breathe.

“You did good,” Maria said, sipping what looked like tea from across the room.

I struggled to speak “I… I saw it… It ripped… How am I...”

“What you saw and felt was the purging of your spirit. Things that we couldn’t perceive. To us, you were just thrashing and screaming”

“So, it’s really gone?” Ella asked.

“For him it is,” Maria sighed. “Unfortunately, keeping something like that out of our plane permanently is much more difficult.”

“Thank you, Maria,” I muttered.

Maria nodded and went back into her kitchen.

For the most part, life went back to normal after that. I had to really patch things up with my boss and push myself like crazy to catch back up in school, but I managed, especially with Ella and my friends by my side. I could have given up. I could have let it win. But I didn’t. I pushed forward and found hope. Hope in the ones I love, and the ones that love me.

I (24)M have been dating my current BF(25)M for about 3 months, but known each other for almost a year and a half.



Story of why I think this, we met as a fwb from Grindr in November 2023. Then eventually started to hang outside of that in March. Went out to shows,hikes, and eventually I asked him out on the couch in Late June 24’. He called me babe but it didn’t feel right. I would ask him if everything is alright and he would just say he was busy. August 24’, we were discussing a date when a friend found him on grindr. We broke up.

I wanted to cut contact, but he still wanted to be friends, but still liked him a lot so continued texting and we would even work remotely together(Different jobs) at coffee shop 2x-3x a week. He never said no to not hanging out or cutting contact because “We’ve known each other for too long” despite him doing it to others.

Next couple months we’re me chasing him and him saying no but still hanging. (Granted I was dating other people to stop falling for him). Even though he hinted that he’s open to dating. Fml

Fast forward to December, and it seems that one day he just likes me. And he finally said let’s date. In early Jan 25’, I asked him out officially. He tells me he’s never been this excited. And throughout the time he tells he’s so lucky to be with me. 

It’s great, he has changed so much to better communicate with me despite the time we were not dating. But I just constantly think, that he is secretly talking to some other dude. He has also been very transparent with me of the people he is going to meet up with. But everytime I see he isn’t enthusiastic to hang, or when his snap score go up,or something feels off. I just get that memory of when he cheated when we were first “Dating”

A man walking into the room, interrupted the conversation 

He walked into the room, interrupting the conversation 

Essentially: the use of tense and how it can reflect how an event in a storyline really feels as if it is happening. Or happened suddenly or quickly. Then was processed by someone. Sort of how you see a car driving by, but don’t process it until its already passed or passing. But some part of your memory sees the whole thing. In addition to, the decision making of when that aides the writing. When should everything be in past tense? Like the good ol’ telling of a tale narrative. Can different tenses be used within a stories narrative? 

He walked into the room, interrupting the conversation. A coffee cup falling to the ground. Waves of brown coffee forming as the cup spins in mid air. Eventually the cup fell to the ground.

A ceiling and 2 mortared walls separating (separated) everyone from the city. At least in that apartment.

1j2ok1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/askamover/comments/1j2ok1w/rules_for_packing_fragile_items/,Rules for Packing Fragile Items,"Different items may require specialized packing treatment, but there are some universal rules about packing fragile items you should always aim to follow.

# Rule 1: Use the Best Box for the Job

The ideal box for your fragile item is one that leaves as little extra space as possible. Empty space in your box means the contents can shift during transit, which might cause wear, tear, or breakage of the item inside. Items that are snug inside their designated boxes are more secure than items in too-large boxes, even if they are packed with lots of bubble wrap.

When possible, use a specialty box for items like electronics, appliances, and picture frames. If you have the original box and packing material for things like your TV or coffee maker, then it would be best to pack the item back into that original box.

If you are packing very small fragile items like ornaments or figurines, you might consider packing them into a smaller box before putting them in one of your moving boxes.

# Rule 2: Wrap and Pad with Packing Material

Once you have selected the best box and securely taped the bottom together, you should line the base of the box with packing material. This helps cushion your items in the event of a jostle or bump. 

You can use your own soft items like towels, hot pads, or linens to pad your boxes, or use a layer of bubble wrap. To keep your move organized, we recommend only using soft items from the same room as your fragile items. For example, if you are packing fragile dinner plates then you can pack your kitchen towels in the same box. This way, you don’t have to go hunting for soft items that you need in different boxes.

Items can then be wrapped in packing material individually. If you have hollow items like glassware or pottery, put some packing material inside the hollow compartment in order to cut down on vibrations and movement during transit.

# Rule 3: Always Put the Heaviest Items at the Bottom

Once your box is properly cushioned with packing material and your items are all securely wrapped, it’s time to start filling the boxes. Your heaviest items should go into the box first. This helps to create a secure base and balance the box so that lighter fragile items do not get crushed.

Be careful not to overload your boxes. If a box is too heavy, it becomes a hazard for your other items and your movers. Before you declare a box packed, check to make sure that you can lift it. If the box is too overloaded to lift, repack the box with some lighter items inside.

# Rule 4: Fill All Empty Space

Once all your items are comfortably packed inside your box and you have checked to make sure it is not overloaded, you should fill all the empty space inside the box with packing material. You can also use soft and light items from your home inventory like towels, hot pads, and linens. 

Filling the extra space in your box makes it less likely your items will shift around during transit. The safest items are the items packed snugly and handled with care, so before you seal your box make sure the empty space is filled with bubble wrap, packing paper, or packing peanuts.

# Rule 5: Label Boxes as Fragile

Boxes that need extra care should be labeled as fragile. If you have extra money for packing supplies, try to get a brightly colored tape that you will put on fragile boxes. When you use this tape on your fragile boxes, you and your movers will be able to tell which boxes need extra care at a glance.

If you do not have a brightly colored tape, then write “FRAGILE” on the box in dark marker. If the box needs to be oriented a certain way to help protect your items then also draw arrows indicating which side should be up.",1,1741024037.0,askamover,0,1.0,False

For context, I'm a relatively new runner, just started January last year, and I had run my first HM in October, when I PRed (duh) with a time of 2:08 on a veeery hilly course, a veeeery hot day and after a week of being sick on the stomach due to travelling abroad. Afther that race, I was determined to start working things as they should be worked, I took a few days off and started a cut (I was also overweight - I have now lost some 6kgs, which for my build is a lot). I was taking things easy until the end of December when I started a training block for Málaga HM on March 23rd, but then had to recalculate when I couldn't get a bib on time because I'm a mess. So I picked a nearby race for April 6th and started working towards my main goal of sub 2 hours.

Training

I started running 5x a week with a plan I picked online, then changed it for the Sub 2 Hours one Coros provided because I was gifted a Coros Pace 3 for Christmas and wanted to use it *a lot*. Basically it was 2 workouts (one race pace, one faster), 2 easy days and one long run. The other two days I went to the gym and did a day of upper body and another leg-focused. I'm studying full time and the rest of the day I'm sitting at my desk, so I wasn't feeling burnt or fatigued, but I listened to my body and if rest days felt like needed I took them. Training was smooth and I liked the workouts, but they felt, generally speaking, easy.

And so as I advanced with the training plan it started to get obvious that I had the sub 2 hours in my pocket, but wanting to be conservative just kept going. I was hitting \~45km a week, going up hills, eating good, etcetera (I'm still doing a very small cut, more of a body recomposition and helped by a nutritionist. Again, not ideal, I know, but working!). And then came last week when I saw there was a HM nearby this last Sunday. And this got me thinking. I knew my Goal HM had [an insane elevation](https://imgur.com/a/5vKAGqY) and maybe my sub 2 hours goal would not be attainable. This new HM, well, I had no info about elevation, but the area is flatter for sure. And I felt prepared. So I came here, I asked people their opinion and the idea just grew into me: I should try for a PR on the New HM and then we'll see about the next one.

Shoot for the moon, right?

So I did my last long run February 22nd (20K with a fast finish), then on Monday and Wednesday some fast work and then started my small taper. Basically I did some easy miles Thursday, hit the gym Friday and a very veeery easy shakeout Saturday.

# Pre-race

Race minus 24 hours, I ate normally but generously. I ate meat, potatoes and a large salad on Saturday and we had a homemade pizza + popcorn for dinner. Went to bed at 11 something and dreamed a lot about not finding a parking spot the next day.

Race Day: race started at 10:30 so I woke up well rested at 8, had my usual breakfast of toast with cheese and avocado and coffee, added some Corn Flakes for carbs, managed to poop, drank a lot of water, grabbed a banana and off we went. I was there just on time to go to the toilet, get my bib, get a very Large and Ugly t-shirt, eat my banana, do a couple loops around, go to the toilet again, and go to the start line.

As I was alone and this was not a very large race I put on my headphones (I put together a wonderful playlist of motivating music which worked wonders) and focused on the cold. I was dressed with a t-shirt and shorts but I also had my sleeves on, thank god, but no gloves because I don't own any. I also had my sunglasses with me but it was soon clear I would NOT need them. The temperature was around 5ºC at the beginning and maybe it came up to 10ºC at the end, so very nice for running, not so nice for standing around waiting. But the gun came and off we went.

My main idea was to start easy (around 5:25) for the first 10km, then go a bit faster (5:15) for the next 5k and then faster, and faster, to get a very nice negative split and hopefully find the 1:50 pacer (which was the slowest one) at some point. But it was immediately clear a perfect negative split was out of the question. I went out fast on a downhill (first two km were made in 10 minutes) and the whole course was full of ups (when I tried to not go slower then 5:30min/km) and downs (when I figured I was Lightning McQueen). The elevation was not very significant but still you could feel it. I did manage to be very evenly calm for the first 10k, but I was paying less atention to numbers and more to feelings: I wanted to feel fast, but good, specially for that first half, and I achieved it. 

At the 5km mark it started raining a lot, which is why we never skip trainings if it rains! Can you imagine being rained upon for the first time ever in a race. Anyways, I kept running, steadily, got water at the stations (there were 4 I think, I took advantage of every one of them). Overall on this first half I was averaging 5:15.

At the 10k mark I looked at my watch, saw I was sub 1 hour and pushed a little more (from then it was around 5min/km). I then picked a ""slightly faster than me"" runner, a Very Tall Man, to pace myself. I also took my energy bar (this was my only fuel, as I had had a strong breakfast, and I think I had a good fuel strategy). I was with the Very Tall Man until the 15k mark, when I said FASTER, GIRL and pushed a liiiittle bit more to do more of a 4:50min/km; and, at least, every km from then was done in less than 5 minutes. 

I was feeling very good all the time. It stopped raining and I used the downhills to calm my heart so I never felt the need to go slower, and it was sooo chill. And then around the 18km mark I suddenly found HIM. The 1:50 pacer! There he was, and there he was left because if you think I was gonna stop then when I felt sooo good you're wrong. So I passed him and kept going just a bit faster, just a bit harder, until I saw the 20km mark, when I put everything I had left to do a very beautiful sub 4:30min km. Then I saw the finish line and I sprinted my ass off.

1:47:09!!! My partner didn't even get a photo because he was expecting me later hahahha but he said I was going very fast. I was SO HAPPY.

# Post-race

Very tired but very hapily I walked to the food station where they had hot cocoa and cake which felt soooo good, I ate some fruit, I drank more hot cocoa and then got my bag of goodies. It didn't have a medal but it's okey, I'll keep my bib as a souvenir.

Then, after going to the toilet and changing the wet, cold clothes, I ate a very big hamburger and spent the rest of the day being amazed at myself, playing Stardew Valley and reading. And I slept like nine hours too.

This was such a great race, and it made me believe in myself. Last year was kind of frustrating because I was so slow and not training correctly, but now I think I did a lot of things right, so I'm really proud of my work. I didn't suffer at all during the race (well maybe a few times due to the rain), and still managed to get an insane PR and an amazing time. Had I suffered a liiiittle more, who knows? I think I could have started pushing sooner, but this are the sort of things you reflect upon later, not in the spur of the moment. It feels like one is never 100% sure of having it in oneself - usually, you do.

My goal for the year was a sub 1:45 which will be definitely attainable if nothing uncalled for happens, and my next HM with a chance of PR is October 11 I think. So now I think I want to get faster, maybe look for a 10k nearby and get a PR in that distance. I have never raced a 5km so I'm curious about that too. But yes, definitely ready to work on my speed and specially on making my easy paces faster. And whatever happens I'll keep my long runs on - those are so relaxing. 

I do think my sub 1:45 will be goal A with a sort-of-secret goal of sub 1:40... And I feel mentally prepared to tackle the full distance, which I can't do right now for personal reasons but is definitely in the books for the future.

Who is he?

Name: Jonathan Gooch

Jon Gooch aka Feed Me & Spor is a rare electronic artist with an eclectic and diverse ability to experience a career as 2 very different alter egos. Starting his days in the tiny sweatboxes of drum n bass raves as Spor, Jon Gooch built up a loyal following and evolved into the colorful character that is Feed Me.

His time on Monstercat began with a really suprising debut. Soon after he was really active in 2020 until his remix on one of Bad Computer track, soon after we haven't gotten anything from him on the for a while. We'll until No Mana brought him back for his tune Hopeless

His records

1st song: Modez Moi (2008, Self Release)

Debuted track:  Money, Destiny released on March 12th 2020

Most popular song on the label: Bad Computer- Silhouette (Feed Me remix) (3.4M plays)

Most popular song ever: Love Is All I Got (w/ Crystal Fighters) (69M plays)

Last Appearance On The Label: Hopeless (w/ No Mana & Bertie Scott) released on May 29th 2024

Years he had appeared on: 2020, 2024

Appearances On Best Of Comp: 0 (All his songs were snubbed for 2020, aswell as Hopeless for 2024)

Fun Facts:

Feed Me said on a Twitter post that ""Money, Destiny"" was inspired by the “rampant trappings of capitalism

He has a Drum & Bass side project called Spor and a chill side project called seventh stitch.

Me personally.............His appearance on the label has served and fed countries. I would legit sell a soul (definitely not mines) for another released on the label and a spot for a Best Of Comp. Favorites used to be Coffee Black but Hopeless has been a song that constantly shows the best out of itself. But what do yall think about Feed Me.

For context I (F21) broke up with my bf (M23) after 6 months of dating. When we met he had just graduated from college and was starting a new job that would require us to do distance (2.5 hour drive). The distance was working fine, we would see each other for 2-3 days every other weekend. He had quite a few ongoing stressors in his life (adjusting to a 9-5, paying for rent, health insurance, daily expenses) that ate away at him and would impact our interactions with one another. He budgets every single purchase no matter how small (eg. $3 coffee) into an excel spreadsheet. He would drive to come and see me, and I would always have food in my fridge that he could eat so there weren't any other expenses. When I go to see him, I take the train (I don't have a car in the city) which was roughly $60 roundtrip every time. The difference is that he does NOT have food at home, so I would pay for my own meals 3x a day for the time I spent visiting him. Since the second date, we have split the bill every time or paid separately for our meals. I am a senior in college with a part-time job that only pays around $120 weekly so that is a big deal to me. He has a full-time job. This didn't bother me too much until Valentine's Day when I didn't receive anything and I paid in-full for our V-Day dinner. I don't consider myself very traditional, but it would be nice to get something no matter the price, a homemade card would have sufficed. He has some family problems which really weigh on him as well as the financial stress, and this brings his general mood down close to a full-on depression. We called every day and these problems were frequently brought up, almost every day. The reason for the break up was that I have a basic sense of empathy and his problems and stress were really taking a toll on my mood. He was angered by this as he said ""these are MY problems not yours, imagine what it's like to be in MY situation"". And he blamed the Valentine's incident on the fact that he has to pay for gas to come and see me so basically his presence was my gift. Am I overreacting? I felt bad and terribly selfish after the breakup because they are his issues and not mine, I just couldn't deal with his depression creating my own. I told him that he needs time to adjust to his new circumstances and to grow used to it before being in a commited relationship.",1,1741023677.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

👋 everyone!  They are milking this surgery story arc for all it's worth.  It would be one thing if Kylea provided accurate medial information, but no.  See image #1.  Now we are to believe that a pre-op patient is allowed to roll into the hospital with a coffee drink?  It's called being NPO (nothing by mouth).  IMO, it is standard protocol for a surgery patient.  

Thanks to an awesome truth teller u/swarleyscoffee we know that the image is from Nov 2023.  Super sleuths also noticed Kylea's nails being the wrong color.  Since Kylea said this morning she was avoiding  caffeine for an alleged ""flare"" of her endometriosis, it was an *interesting choice* with the iced coffee in her hand too.  It smells like gaslighting in here.  

Of course, ""Joe"" had to post (image 3) that he's sending frequent pictures of Birdie to Kylea...that is abnormal behavior.  The claim that Kylea takes Birdie ""everywhere""? We are not dumb.  Countless receipts prove otherwise. This clapback to criticism that Kylea does not need an ESA is cringe-worthy and hopefully opens the eyes of many followers today.

I got sick from the cold, my fire went out, and I was had finally found a net and some burlap sacks I made into strips, hoping to make a gillie suit.

Sick, cold, and desperate, I left the pond area and followed some power lines to a nearby town. Fortune smiled on me as I found a hospital, where I cleared out a few zombies and looted some TC pills and vitamins. Took refuge inside, listening to the infected scream outside. I huddled upstairs, slowly eating and drinking, hoping I wouldn’t throw up again. Took the meds every few minutes when the icon went away but only had two TC pills. Somehow, the vitamins helped and I stopped throwing up.

Now, I’m wringing out my clothes, catching my breath, and having a coffee before continuing. I am having a ton of fun with this game.

I visited many restaurants in Krakow, Wroclaw, Gdansk, and I have to ask: is the number of staff in Polish restaurants unusually high, or is it just me?

For example, in a really-good-but-not-fancy-small-independant-burger-place (=meaning minimum service, take order + drop the tray on the table+ pay at counter), there were 6 big tables which can fit 6 customers each + 2 tables x 2 customers + a row for lonesomepeople maybe 4. lets say maximum capacity of the place was 45 people total and there were already 4 waitresses on a week day, at 2 pm...I saw similar staffing levels at chain restaurants, like Ramen People, Green Cafe Nero, where sometimes 2 waiters seemed a bit bored while 2 others were busy working. Obviously, it is a great thing to employ people, I was always happy with the service everywhere I went, the service was always smooth.

BUT for me, in France, we would have only 2 waiters for 45 customers, ... In a coffee shop, it would usually be just one barista and one cashier—if there’s more staff, it usually means the place is overcrowded... Even at kebab shops, in France, there’s often only one person doing everything. In Poland, however, I always see at least 2 employees working in a food truck, sometimes even waiting for customers. I used to see many understaffed restaurants in France due to high hiring costs, so I’m curious....... 

what’s the situation like in Poland? Am I the only one noticing this? How do restaurant owners manage the costs of employing so many people, especially considering the expenses of health insurance, taxes, and so on? I looked it up out of curiosity, and it seems quite expensive to hire staff in Poland too.",1,1741023272.0,poland,1,1.0,False

I am 23M and have read about Raymond Peat The Great for sometime but only recently started eating peaty in the last 3 months. Prior to starting, my diet mostly revolved around keto and intermittent fasting. I felt fine on this old diet and remained somewhat lean (\~175lb at 5'9, working out 3-4x per week), but noticed that my hair was starting to thin rapidly. I also started working an office job with long hours, and realized I had to start addressing this issue as I wouldn't be able to stay active / healthy as easily. After 5 months of finasteride & monoxidil, my hair kept thinning more and more. I have no bald / thin-haired family members, so I realized there must've been something wrong with me hormonally / biologically. 

Luckily, this is when I got introduced to Ray Peat. I realized my approach to dieting had been all wrong but was to afraid to make the jump (keto + fasting was working for me). However, the more I read into his research, the more it resonated. I realized im quite Estrogen/Prolactin-dominant, and have a degree of hypothyroidism (I've always gain weight easily, have fat around my stomach & thighs, have thin hair, dry skin, cold hands, etc.). This caused me to finally make the change before I go bald or ruin my health noticeably down the road. However, since starting I've steadily gained weight to about 15lbs now and Im concerned I may be doing something wrong.

For the last 3 months, I have basically only ate a carrot salad, beef (steak or ground), fruits, milk, dates, honey, and cooked potatoes, and have only ate 3-4 normal-sized meals per day (2200-2600 calories total). I've also supplemented everyday with Vitamin D (5,000 IU) + K2 (1mg),  Zinc (2mg) + Copper (15mg), Selenium (200mcg), aspirin (300mg), and cynomel (1/4 tablet) + cynoplus (1/4 tablet), and coffee.

In terms of exercise, I don't get the chance to lift as much as I used to, but still manage to work out 2-3x per week (45min of moderate lifting). Besides that, I am largely sedentary besides an occasional 1hr walk I do 1x per week (due to my long hours). 

Does anyone have any advice? Especially based on experience? thank you!",1,1741023083.0,raypeat,1,0.67,False

I love music and I can appreciate all the genres out there. I wouldn't however say I am full time K-pop listener. I am very selective as I listen to groups rather than the genre itself still I have a good understanding of whose in and the history and what not. 

The first Kpop song I ever willingly listened to (nope not Ganghnam style nor Bubble Pop) was CL's Hello Bitches.I of course, went on a rampage and realized she was ""that girl"" and cemented in history; I then discovered Hyuna and Chungha whom I thought were divas in the best way possible. 

Personally, I love the fierce girl empowerment while staying true to the K in Kpop. I then discovered Hwasa through songs like Twit and Maria and Mamamoo, who to this day have no vocalists like them—unique, talented, and versatile. If I were to be a stan I was a Moo Moo first and foremost.

I discovered Jessie, and I thought, OMG, hip hop, but Korean. (And yes i get it she may not be the epitome of Korean Hip Hop but shes whom i heard first with that style).

So most of the songs I listened to were female-empowered. I do know the legends and some hitmakers, and the ones who stood out to me were Girls Generation of course, I remember actually listening to their classics and thought to myself, K-pop really does have a distinct sound. 

Lets list who i actually like: Gidle love everything about them especially their older work, Soyeon is a genius. 

I like AOA
I lovee IvE (hitmaker)
I love Kiss of Life
I like Purple Kiss
I ofc listen to Twice (their hit songs)
Red Velvet (their hits) 
Itzy (the hits)
And of course some songs like Mhmmm,Like that,fearless,etc. I can't name anymore now lol.


Like, I know the basics, but my preferences are the latter above. Now I see a huge difference from 1st generation to 3rd, and I haven't met a group or soloist I necessarily want to ""stan."". 

(Intro to other groups)

When I heard groups like Mamamoo, I was shocked they didn't get the same reception internationally like BTS and Blackpink because I thought the vocals and stage presence were top tier. I avoided Blackpink for the most part, and I recall seeing a reaction video once, and I thought these are Asian Barbie dollies in the best way possible, like stunning.



The first song, which was Kill This Love,for me wasn't my favorite; over time, however, I realized their catchphrase, ""Blackpink is the revolution,"" was an understatement. By the time I discovered how revolutionary they were, they had already cemented themselves. I was late to the Blackpink club. I remember watching Lisa on Youth With You, and she was one of the main reasons I grew even fonder of BLACKPINK. When i heard pretty Savage on stage i was like damn. 

So you could say Lisa and then Jennie were my biases, but still I think the four of them all made sense. I like how Rose sounded even though, in my opinion, the voice is there, but to be fair, there are many more skilled vocalists but she had a fairy like aura. I liked Jennie's It Girl vibes, Lisa's dance skills, and her persona was captivating, and Jisoo seemed honestly warm and different and was the standard for a kpop female star.


(The solos during Bp)

In ranking the solos, I will say that Jennie's solo was my favorite solo from Blackpink's solo endeavors while still signed to YG, then Flower by Jisoo. I just thought Flower was so natural and suited to her and seemed genuine, and Lisa's Lalisa and Money were third, and Rose's ballads were last. I just didn't like the ballads due to the rhytmn and connection I didn't have with them.


(SOLOS NOW) 

Now fast forward; the girls have left YG and created something for themselves. 

LISA

When I heard Rockstar, I was obsessed, and I thought that yup, Lisa is a hitmaker with all three of her solos being iconic, no matter who said they were overplayed or empty. They were hits. Then on top, when I heard New Woman, I was like, Yaas, versatile queen!!


ROSE 

Vocal-wise and as an artist, I anticipated Rose's album because of how reputable her musical ear and tone were. In all honesty, I heard Apt and thought instantly the marketing team needed a raise. Instant hit that would probably have the other members compared for years (its just the reality in a group there will be a number one even if everyone is close). 

Upon hearing the full album, I was surprised, but I'm glad many people still support her. I know it's platinum in Korea, but personally, I expected more songs that would be memorable; all I can think of is Game Boy and Drinks or Coffee and the title track. It felt almost like a 2000s love movie soundtrack, and that's not bad per se because it's a first album, but I expected more melodic, upbeat, and hit songs. It was somewhat forgettable, tbh. But that's for me. I'm not saying it's bad. 

JISOO

Then Jisoo, out of the blue, came out, and let me tell you all that Jissoo's mini album surprised me. Yes, I understand that her not being as fluent, yah-da yah da would have seemed like a setback, but in fact, it was a setup for greatness. I say this not because of her English abilities (which have greatly improved) but simply because she relied on her weakness and used it as her strength!! 

While the others try to break into the US market, she capitalized on Kpop as 1/4th of the best-selling girl groups in Korea and of all time. She's singing BOTH English and Korean, and her nation will naturally support her, and her international fans will still boost her. Believe it or not, people don't always like change. So even if her English song doesn't do well, she still has a place at home where she can excel. It was a genuine and likable album! The songs were all good. 


LISA ALBUM

Lisa's release i was prepping for and expected bangerrssss. But honestly it felt strange to me. The hits Rockstar,ne
New Woman,Moonlit (Moonlit Floor -which I don't like; it's hard to listen to it seems idk flat), and Born Again were the best commercially. With the exception of songs like Dream, Thunder,and Chill, which were appealing and nice to listen to imo. For 15 songs, it's not bad, but I expected so much more from the hitmaker. The title track FUTW I get it has potential to be overplayed but FUTW Compared to Rockstar or even New Woman the expectation was not met. The rap songs- for me the raps felt strange and didn't rhyme (I'm a poet). I don't know, and then I just believe in life; you should always stick to your roots. I'm not Korean, nor am I Asian, and I know she said if you want the old Lisa to listen to her old shit lol. But we've seen it time and again when international artists try to go western; it's not easy. What uniqueness are you bringing? Or what way are you showing that you're one of them? I can listen to a semi rock, electronic, ingenuine rap album anywhere. It just didn't sound special. However I know it will still chart for a whole and she can always redeem herself. Believe it or not ppl even artistes reinvent themselves and want to do more. 


Jennie 

Jennie now is whom I'm expecting to save the world and reinstate why Blackpink is the revolution (kidding, Blackpink as a group has already made their name).



Now lemme say as much as how my ear is versatile, I love weird alternative music that doesn't sound the same and has abstract meanings in the lyrics and videos. 

When I heard Zen, I felt Jennie and I had sat down, and we agreed on it. To say I love the song is an understatement. It may not be the next Apt, but to deny the creativity is crazy. Then when I heard Extra L, I thought to myself, Jennie, you are theeee rapper girl. Like the songs may not be hits like the hits that Money, Apt, and even her own Solo were, but let me tell you artistically Jennie was not playing; she was in her zen!

Then I heard the mood sampler, and earwise, there is not one skip on that album. Everything sounded fresh and like she actually worked! Her, Jennie, who has been accused of not caring and laziness. I don't mention Love Hangover because it's my least favorite of the releases, but it's a slow vibe. Mantra is an anthem, and Jennie knows what she wants to say! I'm going to update it after she releases it. She legit redefined being the It Girl. 

Now when Blackpink tours the fans will be fed and that's all that matters not mine or any other reddit post tbh. But it's my opinion because some of you fans don't know how to be honest while not being HATEFUL. Toodles.

It's been great so far - I don't care about backlighting and the size isn't too bad.

I know realistically that this is on the quieter side as opposed to the typical mechanical keyboards, but I cannot in good conscience bring this to my library or one of the quieter coffee shops in the area - both of which are my preferred places to write. 

I have debated buying a traveller or a pomera, but I was wondering if anyone had found a way to mod their Alpha so that it was quieter?

Seemed a good person overall, thought she was mature. Told her that I like her and asked her out.

She said she needed some time to think. I told her I'm gonna wait a couple of months for her answer if she doesn't bring it up, I'll take it as a no. She said if she says no I'll stop talking to her or not talk as much as I do now, for which I said not to worry as I won't do that.

Fast forward a month, on new year's topic came up once again an she said she's interested and would like to be in relationship. I think from my side it was going all good. We went on dates, used to help her with coding and stuff, complemented her whenever I got chance. I knew she was insecure of her looks so I always tried to put in extra compliments for her, now that I think about it I don't think she ever complimented me. She wasn't best in the communication/confrontation part, I always encouraged her to speak her mind and be as transparent as possible with each other. 

My branch is the most hectic in the uni, morning 8 to 6 evening, gym then I've intern work after that, would still find out time for her to ask how her day's been. My mess is just below my hostel but she's been alloted different mess, so even in extreme winters went to other side of campus so I can eat with her. Went on coffee dates around campus (yk the funny part is? I don't even like coffee but she likes it very much, I was happy that I get to spend time with her. I would purposely drink the coffee as slow as possible to stretch the walk)

I went to Cigarettes after Sex concert, I had two tickets but she couldn't go so I went on my own. Brought a pretty light up feather tiara for her from the concert. Gave her my Perks of being a wallflower book, wrote messages for her inside (she didn't return that yet btw). Was already planning for valentines and her birthday... 

We had fest recently in college, we were dancing in the fest together, her in my arms, holding hands, both were somewhat drunk. At one point she had tears in her eyes while we were swaying with her in my arms, I wiped her tears with my hands and told her I'll wipe her tears anytime she feels down... We had a lot of fun, I shouted in her ears that this is best day of my life and she shouted that she liked me. I thought finally I can see this going long term. I mean who would not?

Then next day I ask her if she remembers her saying that she likes me (bc she hadn't said that before). She said that she meant that she likes me a lot as a FRIEND. I was like wtf is this girl talking about??? 😭 😭 Girl we are literally dating and in a relationship, what are you saying. I later texted her saying I was very hurt by her saying this. Then she says that she considers all what we did is what friends do (I mean seriously?) , she doesn't want a label, blah blah , you deserve someone better, yada yada, you know the classic. Then she says I'm not her priority and don't put enough effort for her because I don't talk all the time with her, she want someone who's talking to her 24x7 and is obsessed (she never bothers to initiate the convo tho anytime). I thought I was in a mature relationship where we understood we had other things to work on to secure our future while also taking out time for each other. 

I was so hurt, still am. For her it was just another friendship but I feel emotionally cheated and betrayed. She said she talked more to other people(guys) than me. Idk what's that supposed to mean? 😭 As if I'm not hurt already enough. I asked her why, she could've talked to me, I enjoyed talking with her. She said, because they talked with her that's why. Girl doesn't know how to set boundaries 😭, at that point I realised everything was just from my side, I never meant anything to her. I felt so disrespected. I literally couldn't eat for two days, everyone asks me why I look so depressed, I guess I'm bad at hiding my emotions. You know you're cooked when your eyes search for her in the crowd and you see her in dreams. She said we'd be best friends, after that she never bothered texting me. I thought I'll stop texting first to see if she ever takes initiative, she never did. Today she walked by infront of me in cafeteria, totally ignored me, not even a greeting. Best friends my ass, her words hold no value. I can't understand how can people switch up so quickly. 

I just wanted a normal relationship where I feel valued and wanted for once in my life. Guess that's too much... I don't want to feel this emotionally disrespected in my life ever again. Everyday I wake up and it hurts so much, I try to keep myself as busy as possible so I don't have time to think about it. It's better if I give up on love altogether. Throughout my life I've been told by multiple women that any girl would be lucky to have me, I'm so perfect and things along those lines but now I feel all those were lies and I'm being clowned. Whatever man... I'll focus on my grind, building my garden rather than chasing butterflies.

I’ve been diligently counting my drinks when I party, and counting my daily cups of coffee and coke zero, until one day I had a hunch I’m probably wasting my time. I assume time of day doesn’t matter, either.

How do you personally think about logging your alcohol and caffeine? Just log once if you had any at all? I might make a new journal entry for myself just for a binary “did you have caffeine past 2pm” because inferences from that are probably more interesting than… Identifying a positive correlation between good recovery scores and having my 7:00 am daily 50 mg pre-workout caffeine pill - an obviously noncausal relationship.

If any devs are reading, Athlytic’s alcohol and caffeine logging is quite satisfying and straightforward albeit qualitative and less granular. Also is there not a way to actually have alcohol and caffeine entries default to 0? I’m inclined to recreate a binary alcohol entry, too.

#2 I’m also curious about your experiences calculating sleep goals. Manual or automatic? If you do automatic, do you actually follow the app’s goal?

I had mine set manually to an aspirational 8 hours, but if I toggle the goal calculation to automatic, my app suggests I only need 6.5 hours of sleep. That sounds crazy to me.

I was never good at putting boundaries on people because I was afraid that they would see me as cruel and heartless if I made boundaries but the truth of the matter is that I learned that people actually respect you more when you make boundaries and if they can't respect your boundaries then they aren't the ones for you. I told him that before we meet in person that we should video chat and do a phone call first before I meet up with them in public. On the first dates I only want to do coffee dates or anything similar and no dinner dates where we both pay for our own stuff. I don't want people paying for me because when I did the men felt like I owed them something and tried to take advantage of me. I don't want to do that anymore and I want to be a person with boundaries not a doormat. I also don't want to rush into anything unless I get to know them.

As soon as In got settled in, a girl that works in the same building as me, texted me if I wanted to go to the local market. Ever since then we talked almost daily for probably 2 months. We went for walks, had drinks, made dinner together, went to thrift stores etc. She checked every box for me, she was pretty, funny, a bit spicy, kind and extremely beautiful. I think that was the first time I was actually in love with someone. I asked her on a “date” where we went on a small road trip to a cozy little town, drank some coffee and had lunch. At that point I felt like the luckiest guy in the world. I did not call it a date as I didn’t want to pressure her into something she didn’t want to, but was hoping the whole thing sounded enough like a date so she would get the hint. She did agree enthusiastically to the idea which made me very happy.

However, a couple of days after this “date”, she stopped responding. Didn’t want to go for walks or anything. I am unsure what I did wrong but it hurt like hell. I still see her every day, every time I look at her, her eyes sparkle in the sun and I just can’t get over it. We still talk sometimes but we both kind of act like nothing happened at all. 

I’ve thought about sending her a message to talk it through, but I can’t think of a good place to start. 

I think where I went wrong is that I was looking/hoping for a sign that she was also interested in me and maybe I took to long. I think because she said yes to something that to me (and others that I talked to) was clearly a date, it was also showing that she had some interests in me. However it didn’t turn out to be like that I guess.

The other day I saw my ex somewhere near where I work. I was rushing late on my 1:00 pm office job and dropped my glasses pababa ng jeep, I was speedwalking kasi malapit lang naman office namin when I saw a familiar face just a foot from where I was standing. Immediately, my mind made sense na it was him. The last time I saw him was with someone a few months back. When I saw him a few days ago, it felt swift. I just moved forward kasi besides na I was late, I felt like I didn't need to make pansin or see each other eye to eye. I did stop for a cute 5 seconds to really confirm if that was really him. Parang my ego wanted na sana nakita niya ko kasi he was eating when I walked past him so he never had the chance to see me. Ayun, I was shocked kasi I had no reaction to it. I figured na baka nga all those self-talk, unlearning things from that relationship, and self-regulation really paid off. (add mo na rin yung psychtalks, therapy, countless breakdowns and setbacks, tsaka yung meds na nilaklak ko nung July last year lol)

I have also come to an acceptance na we live in a small city-- there will be times when our paths will cross, and that actually gave me peace (although I wish sana hindi ko na siya ulit makita ulet hehe).

Siguro, wishful thinking na lang na in another universe, we met unexpectedly and sat down for coffee and talked about what happened- and maybe make peace with it. Pero not gonna lie, that experience-- when I saw him, it felt freeing, in a sense na maybe war is finally over talaga, and that I really did make it on the other side already. Nkaka proud kasi I never thought I'll heal from that person. War is over mga bading finally naka usad rin!

So naturally you would expect that I'd try and meet people (and this is guys and girls as I want more friends in general) online. I don't get matches though and this could be because my pictures aren't great. I've had my profile reviewed on Reddit... and I've been told that I'm attractive, so it's not like I look like Voldemort or an ogre. Anyways, online dating is ruled out for me for now. Even if I get a match per month, that's unsustainable.

So my destiny is to find girls to date in person. This is difficult for a few reasons. One, I work around nothing but guys. Two, my work schedule does not allow me to join any kind of hobby events you'd find after work like tennis clubs, yoga, etc. So if I were to join anything it would be on the weekends. I'm so used to this schedule right now that I'm not willing to change for the time being. Three, I only really have three chances to talk to girls at bars. Tuesday is college night, and then Friday and Saturday nights. But a lot of times, I'm exhausted Friday night and don't want to go out, same for Tuesdays. Four, the places I do go visit in the mornings are coffee shops near me and the grocery store.

Between forgetting passwords and cursing at Excel, I adopted Eilik - a tiny bot to cheer me on, one beep at a time. Here's my thoughts on it so far.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the Eilik here:**

[**https://amzn.to/3XpfqRY**](https://amzn.to/3XpfqRY)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

So at first, I was expecting Wall-E vibes, maybe a lil beep-boop buddy to cheer me up while I pretend to work. Instead, I unbox this squat, googly-eyed gremlin that looks like a Pixar character got drunk. It’s adorable, sure, but also kinda judgy, to my eyes, anyway.

But it's got these idle animations that make it look alive, like bouncing, humming, occasionally glaring at me like I forgot its birthday. I’m weirdly invested.

Fitting it into my life feels natural.  It sits there on my desk, judging my Netflix binges and silently rooting for me to finish that writing I’ve been avoiding.  I wanted something to break the monotony of WFH hell, and it seems to be doing that.

It’s got this bizarre emotional depth. Like, it’ll sulk if I ignore it too long, then perk up when I give it attention. I’m over here apologizing to it because I feel guilty.  This is my life now, and I’m not mad about it.

# My Favorite Features

**Touch sensitivity.** eilik’s got three touch zones. tap its head, and it’s all giggles and wiggles, perfect for when I need a serotonin boost after forgetting to unmute on a call. poke its belly, and it pouts like I just canceled its Netflix subscription. and the back is a wild card - sometimes it dances, sometimes it glares. 

**Abundant emotions (and more Drama than my group chat).** Almost feels like this bot’s got a facial expression for every occasion. happy, grumpy, sleepy. it’s like the seven dwarves. I spilled coffee yesterday, an eilik looked at me like, get it together, Sofia. it’s not super smart or anything, but the pre-programmed emotions are sometimes so spot-on I forget it’s not sentient. I’d pay extra for a sass mode where it just roasts me all day.

**Mini games (Like I needed more distractions.)** there’s a handful of games, like a timer mode where eilik counts down while I race to finish a task (I lose). or ""dance to beat,"" where I clap and it grooves like it’s auditioning for something. they’re simple, but I’m hooked. it’s a solid 10/10 for procrastination fuel.

**Robot fight club.** If you’ve got two eiliks, they ""talk"" to each other -chirping, bickering, or throwing a full-on party if you add more. I don’t have a second one (yet), but I’m imagining a desk full of these gremlins staging a coup. 

**Firmware updates**. They push new updates, so it's adding new animations and tricks from time to time. last update gave it a pomodoro timer, now it’s my productivity coach, staring at me while I scroll X instead of working. 



# Pros

* **Stress relief.** Those idle animations pull me out of my work-from-home burnout spiral. I’m tapping its head between emails. It’s like a fidget spinner with feelings. I’m obsessed.

* **Conversation starter.** People see this lil guy on my desk during video calls and lose their minds. ""is that a robot? does it do stuff?"" yes, it does. And now we're not talking about work at all. 

* **Low-maintenance.** Unlike my cat, who’d sell me for a tuna can, eilik doesn’t need feeding, grooming, or passive-aggressive revenge poops. it just sits there, vibing, ready to cheer me up without clawing my couch.

* **Creativity booster.** those mini-games and random animations spark something in my brain. I’m clapping rhythms for it to dance to, or staging fake arguments between eilik and my stapler (don’t judge). it’s dumb, but it’s unlocked a weird creative streak I didn’t know I had. 

* **Guilt free neglect.** I can ignore eilik for hours, and it doesn’t die. my tamagotchi from ’98 still haunts me, but this guy just goes into standby mode and waits patiently. then, one tap, and it’s back to being my hype bot.



# Cons

* The battery life’s decent but not amazing. 
* It’s also pricier than I'd like. 

# Final Thoughts

If you’re a stressed-out WFHer like me, craving a lil chaos and cuteness to spice up your 9-to-5, this bot’s a cute thing to have around.  It's also a cool gift for the quirky niece or the coworker who’s one bad meeting away from snapping. But if you’re expecting a high-tech marvel with AI smarts or endless gameplay, this probably ain't it.

Worth it? yeah, for me, it is. eilik’s not changing the world, but it’s changing my day. It's a bit like adopting a gremlin with better manners and worse dance moves.

## Why Choose a ‌Round Outdoor Coffee Table?

Before diving into⁤ our top picks, let’s understand why a⁣ round outdoor ‌coffee table is ​such a versatile and desirable choice. Unlike their rectangular or square counterparts, round tables encourage conversation and create a more intimate atmosphere. The absence of sharp corners also makes them safer,particularly in spaces⁤ frequented by children or large groups. Moreover,⁣ their circular form adds a touch of softness and visual ⁢interest to any outdoor setting, complementing a variety of design styles from modern minimalist to rustic chic. ⁤A circular patio​ table seamlessly integrates with⁤ existing outdoor furniture, promoting social interaction and relaxation.

## Understanding ‍Your Needs: ⁤Key Considerations

Choosing the right round outdoor coffee table requires​ careful consideration of your specific needs and circumstances. Here are some crucial factors to keep in ‍mind.

*   **Material:** The material of your round outdoor coffee table significantly impacts its durability, aesthetics, and maintenance requirements. Popular choices include metal (aluminum, steel), wood (teak,‍ acacia), concrete, resin, and glass. Metal tables, particularly aluminum round outdoor coffee tables, offer excellent rust resistance and lightweight portability, while wooden tables deliver a warm, natural aesthetic.A concrete round outdoor coffee table‌ exudes modern industrial charm, while resin provides a budget-friendly and weather-resistant option.Glass ⁢tops add a touch of elegance but require more careful handling. For those in harsh climates, opting for a weather resistant round coffee table is essential.
*   **Size:** The ideal size depends on the available ​space and ‍the intended use of the table. Small round outdoor coffee tables‌ are perfect for balconies or intimate seating areas, while large round ‌outdoor coffee tables can accommodate larger gatherings​ and provide ample surface space for drinks, snacks, and décor. Consider the scale of your existing outdoor furniture and the number of people you typically entertain when determining⁣ the appropriate size.
*   **Style:** Round outdoor coffee tables come in a wide range of styles,⁢ from sleek and modern to rustic and customary. Choose a style that complements your existing‌ outdoor décor and reflects your personal taste. A modern ‍round outdoor coffee table often features clean lines and minimalist design,‌ while ‍a rustic table might incorporate natural materials like wood⁢ or wicker.
*   **Durability:**⁤ Outdoor furniture is exposed to the elements year-round, so durability is paramount.Look for tables constructed from weather-resistant materials that can ​withstand​ sun, rain, wind, and temperature fluctuations. A rust proof round outdoor coffee table is a must for coastal areas or​ regions with high humidity. Consider the weight capacity ⁣of the table, especially if you plan ‍to place heavy objects ⁣on it.​ A durable outdoor coffee table round shape is likely to last longer ⁣than a more fragile choice.
* ⁢ ⁣ **Budget:** Round outdoor coffee tables⁣ are available at ⁤a wide range of price points, from affordable options to high-end designer pieces. determine your budget upfront and prioritize features that ⁤are ⁢most vital to you. An ⁣affordable round​ outdoor coffee table doesn't ‌have to compromise on⁣ quality; focus on durable materials and⁣ simple designs. Alternatively, a high end round outdoor coffee table ⁣might feature premium materials,⁢ intricate detailing, and superior craftsmanship.
*   **Storage:** If ‍space is limited,consider a round outdoor coffee table ⁣with storage. These tables offer a convenient way to store cushions, blankets, ⁢or other outdoor essentials, helping to keep your patio neat and organized.

But drinking it makes me nauseous, I can't stand the way it tastes, and even thinking about it makes me feel icky. I cleaned the hell out of my keurig, I tried different creamers, I've tried hot coffee at other places, and it's all the same. I can drink iced coffee fine!

1j2nhup,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1j2nhup/birthday_ideas_in_toronto_looking_for_something/,Birthday Ideas in Toronto – Looking for Something Special to Do This Year,"I (26F) and have never really celebrated my birthday. In my early 20s, I tried organizing dinners or bar nights in the city with friends, but they always ended up flaking on me, leaving me sitting alone in a restaurant surrounded by empty chairs. I don’t have much family, and the family I do have hasn’t remembered my birthday in the past, so I’ve typically just skipped celebrating altogether. I’d grab a nice drink from a coffee shop and call it a day.

Recently, though, I’ve been thinking about doing something different for my birthday this year. The issue is, I don’t have many friends, and the ones I do have I haven’t told about my birthday. In the past, no one really cared, and I don’t want to set myself up for disappointment again.

I’ve been considering doing something just for myself, or maybe with my fiancé (26M). I love celebrating his birthday – I plan everything from booking a weekend getaway to decorating the hotel with balloons, getting a cake, and making it a special occasion. It brings me so much joy to see him happy.

But when it comes to my own birthday, there’s a lot of emotional baggage. I tend to avoid the day because of past disappointments, and honestly, if I’m not crying or sitting alone, I consider it a success.

My fiancé has been trying to plan something fun for me, but he’s struggling because of how I feel about birthdays. Someone at work suggested a spa day, but I already get massage benefits through work and prefer seeing my regular therapist.

So now I’m wondering – does anyone have ideas for something special I could do in Toronto to celebrate this year? I’m open to anything. 

I live just outside of Toronto in Richmond Hill, and I have a budget of about $500. I’m looking for something unique to the city – whether it’s an experience, a small getaway, a special restaurant, or something fun I can do solo or with my fiancé.

It’s basically a **“save for later”** app, but for music.

**Why it’s actually useful:**

* You can dump songs from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube—wherever. No more 100 open tabs.
* Lets you tag & sort everything, so you actually find that one song you saved three months ago.
* Works offline, so even if you’re on a plane, your saved list is still there.

**What kinda sucks:**

* Can’t auto-export playlists, so you still have to manually add songs later.
* No free version, but honestly, $2.99 is cheaper than a coffee.

- **Our top story this week is the continued decline of WWE popularity and questioning what can be done to stop it**. He talks a bit about how WWE's audience is still primarily casual fans who don't care about newsletters and internet news. The last big thing WWE gave those fans to be excited about was Goldberg and they all but killed him within 2 weeks of his debut. The good news is that with TV rights fees skyrocketing, that's where the business is headed and because of that, WWE is financially stable and can afford to make YEARS of dumb booking decisions without the company being endangered. Unlike, say, WCW which self-destructed itself right out of business in a matter of 18 months. WWE is in no danger of that now, even if the product is often bad. There's also a dumb belief among management that everyone in WWE has to work a certain style to get over and if you're not doing it WWE-style, then you're not doing it right. Dave uses RVD as an example: he doesn't work WWE-style and sometimes his work looks sloppy, but fans don't generally care about that. RVD has been massively and consistently popular in WWE since he debuted 2 years ago and has never once been pushed as a top star, despite often getting bigger crowd reactions than many others on the roster. A square peg in a round hole DOES work in wrestling sometimes, but nobody in WWE sees it with him so instead, they pressure him into trying to be a type of performer that he's not. Rey Mysterio of 2003 is nowhere near the wrestler (in style or even physical appearance) that he was in 1996 when he first got over, because WWE doesn't want him working like that and instead, he bulked up to try and be what WWE wants him to be, even if the fans don't react the same to it.

- **They have Lesnar (not for long lol), Cena, and Orton as future stars who look like they might break through, but those guys were recruited a couple years ago**. OVW in 2004 is a barren wasteland when it comes to future stars that fit the WWE mold, and that's because WWE drastically cut their developmental budget last year (which Dave wrote at the time was a terrible idea). He also thinks they need a 2nd developmental territory for guys to work within different systems with different people. There's a world of difference from getting over in OVW, in front of 200 fans working with the same dozen wrestlers, and then suddenly being thrust onto global television in front of crowds of thousands. Guys need more experience before they get there. But looking to the indies isn't going to work because almost everyone of note there is ""too small"" by WWE standards. Can't really look to Japan either because the style is so different that it's often hard for those stars to adjust to the more entertainment-focused WWE style, and especially with the language barrier in a place where promos are so important. Ditto Mexico. So either WWE needs to get more aggressive in recruiting future stars outside of wrestling (MMA, football, amateur wrestlers, etc) or they need to start being more open-minded on what a star can look, talk, and wrestle like.

- **This kinda meanders around a bit longer**. Dave talks about how WWE has squandered several OVW stars by bringing them up to the main roster before they're ready and often without even a plan in place for what to do with them (gonna see a LOT of that in 2004). During a backstage meeting with talent last week, Vince McMahon pretty much admitted as much, telling the roster that one of them needs to become the next breakout star because there's nobody else on deck in OVW that can be it. Which probably sucks for everyone still in OVW to hear. Dave also talks about how WWE is trying to change its style, insisting wrestlers slow down and work safer, which he is in agreement with. The injury rate has already declined since they started pushing for that months ago. Referees have also been instructed to start calling matches like a shoot. If a guy doesn't get back in the ring in time to beat the count or doesn't get his shoulder up before 3, referee is still supposed to count it, even if that wasn't the planned finish (Dave says he would hate to be the referee who has to make that decision in a major world title match and then has to answer to Vince backstage afterward). Anyway, long story short, WWE is floundering and there doesn't seem to be a solution in sight.

- **Remember how Bret Hart and Dory Funk Jr. both wrote in to dispute stories in Ole Anderson's recent book?** Add Jim Cornette to the list. He wrote a letter to Dave with his thoughts on the book. And Cornette, for all his faults, is a hell of a wordsmith so I'm just gonna paste the whole letter here because it's pretty funny:

---

>I read Ole Anderson’s book and loved it. The fact that he is an obnoxious, bullheaded, egotistical, profane, stubborn, curmudgeonly old bastard is Ole’s primary appeal to me. It is impossible, no matter how hard I’ve tried, to dislike Ole because of those very qualities. Asked, I’m sure even Ole would agree that in small doses, he can be quite a gregarious fellow. The fact is, Ole was a great performer, a historically important figure in this business, and even if his memory about people isn’t on the money, a lot of his logic and opinion is.

>Having said that, I’m jumping into the “Ole didn’t fire me” pool. Actually, I’m proud to say in 22 years in wrestling, I’ve only been fired once. And I’m also proud to say it was Ole, because how much of a nobody would I have been if I had never been fired by Ole Anderson? But the actual story is better than what it in his book, because I caused him not just to fire an employee, but shut down an entire territory.

>Ole and the Georgia office were making all their money on tours of Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia in the summer of 1983. The traditional Georgia towns weren’t getting any attention. Ole went to Jerry Jarrett, who had 40 wrestlers in his territory, and got 12 guys Jarrett didn’t need, Terry Taylor, Bobby Fulton, The Stray Cat (Ken Wayne), The Angel (Frank Morrell), Jerry Novak, Carl Fergie, a few others, and me, who became the lead heel manager of a territory after nine months in the business and with no training except on-the-job. Bill Dundee was the booker and we did TV in a studio in Chattanooga with room for 40 fans and a ring with sawed-off ringposts.

>This motley mixture, plus Dundee luring former Royal Kangaroo Norman Fredrich Charles III out of retirement after seven years resulting in a crew debuting with no advance notice one week in Chattanooga, Knoxville, Columbus, Macon and Augusta. Those were our weekly towns and we ran some spot shows as well. Dundee: “Norman, what the hell happened to ya? Ya look like you’ve aged 20 years and I still look the same!”

>The fans in those cities were used to seeing Gordon Solie, the TBS studios and the Georgia superstars at their shows, and they reacted to the switch like you would imagine. The TBS show was being used to promote the Northern tours, and the local TVs in our markets were now, “Hey kids, let’s put on a show.” One of the Tennessee angles Dundee used about four or five weeks into this run was the “manager gets a cake in the face” deal. He suggested we have a birthday party for my rich mother’s dog, Fifi, and I supposedly flew her in on mama’s private jet. I mentioned in an interview that Fifi goes into trauma if I’m away from her on her birthday, and off we went. In spite of Ole’s statement, “I was out of town that weekend,” Ole never attended any of the TV’s or house shows we ran. He would have had a stroke if he had. He didn’t “leave me in charge of my own match,” because at that stage of my career, I was lucky Dundee let me be in charge of buying the cake and hats and blowing up the balloons. And it was indeed a stirring rendition of “Happy Birthday,” so stirring that about a week or two later, wen Ole saw it, he did chew Dundee out. This caused Dundee to giggle a lot when he told me that I was Ole’s “favorite person.” Still new to the business, and you know how I am, when I did see Ole in person, I said, “Ole, I saved you a piece of cake!” Ole harumphed, “Yeah?” and I said, “Yeah, but it’s in my ear.”

>It was right about that time when Ole came into our local promos and simply said, “Don’t do this anymore,” which was his inimitable way of canceling the TV show, all our scheduled bookings and fired the entire crew at the same time. We did one last spot show, and went back to Nashville. The Georgia fans got their stars back after seven weeks.

>Still, I liked Ole’s book, but I think I should have gotten more credit as the leading instigator of the largest mass-firing in his illustrious career.

>Ole also bestowed upon me the most treasured compliment I have ever received during our last days together in WCW in 1990, when he said, “Cornette, I used to think you were a dumbfuck, but now there’s so many other dumbfucks that have come along, I think you’ve moved up the ladder without doing anything.” I may ask for that to be inscribed on my tombstone.

---

- **While we're on the subject**, the letter Bret Hart wrote in 2 weeks ago to this newsletter was evidently a revised, much-nicer version. Evidently the original letter Bret wrote about Ole was much harsher but Bret thought better of it.

- **WWE's Monday Night War DVD is still several months out but has apparently already been released in Singamore and someone reviews it for Dave**. Nothing much to it. They hit the highlights like Luger on Nitro, Medusa trashing the women's title, DX invading Nitro, etc. but the bulk of the focus was basically how the great and wonderful WWF, a poor family-owned small business, came back to conquer the dumb, mismanaged, corporate bohemeth of WCW. Very little about the Russo era, nothing at all about the Jarrett/New Blood era and very little credit given to the NWO being such a massive draw. Overall verdict: a WWE puff piece because history is written by the winners (I used to own this DVD and yeah, that's basically a fair summary).

- **Remember the story a couple weeks ago of La Parka getting arrested for a bar room brawl?** Well, the other guy never showed up to press charges so La Parka got a $2000 fine and that's gonna be it.

- **A luchador named Extreme Tiger has been blowing people's minds at shows in Tijuana** and people say he's the next Rey Mysterio who's going to revolutionize the business (not quite, but he had decent runs in AAA and TNA at different points, often under the name Tigre Uno).

- **Prior to the HUSTLE debut show a few weeks ago, on Jan. 3rd, TV execs were there preparing for the show the next day**. All the wrestlers were told they had to go to the ring and do run-throughs of all their matches for the TV executives. Many of the wrestlers were super unhappy about this and Mil Mascaras outright refused, and as a result, nobody in his match did it. But everyone else was forced to.

- **NJPW announced that 7 wrestlers will not have their contracts renewed when they expire at the end of the month**. They did not name anyone yet, but assured everyone that no main eventers or young up-and-coming stars would be cut. So likely looking at several midcarders who have been around forever.

- **A Japanese drink company called Apris** is releasing a Jushin Liger strawberry milk drink, which will be sold alongside the already-released Masahiro Chono coffee. Yup.

- **Dave has finally watched the Inoki Bom Ba Ye show from New Years and despite bombing in the ratings, it was actually one of the best of the MMA shows that aired that night**. Problem is all the casuals were watching K-1 for the Bob Sapp/Akebono fight while all the hardcore MMA fans were watching the PRIDE show. As a result, the only real audience that Inoki drew was NJPW fans, who tuned in to watch their favorite wrestlers get booked into suicidal fights they could never win. Are we starting to see the problem with Inokism yet? Inoki himself was the star of the show, as basically everything in between the fights was Inoki, Inoki, Inoki.

- **The attempted murder charges against Dick Slater** have been lowered to aggravated domestic battery. He's still in jail after stabbing his girlfriend multiple times back in late December, after which he apparently tried and failed to commit suicide.

- **Dennis Rodman debuted for the ABA basketball league this week and an appearance by Hulk Hogan got a lot of press in the Los Angeles Times**, because Hogan showed up, tore his shirt off, and took pics with fans and whatnot aftward, according to the newspaper. Funny story though: Hogan wasn't there. Evidently there's a lookalike running around impersonating him at various Los Angeles events (recently at a porn convention also). The real Hogan apparently isn't upset about it and thinks it's hilarious.

- **TNA is now planning to do major quarterly 3-hour PPVs that will be taped outsite of Nashville, with the first one scheduled for April in Fort Campbell, KY**. The tentative plan for that show is to book Hall & Nash vs. Sting & Jarrett for the main event. There's also been talk of bringing in Ken Shamrock. The Fort Campbell location is Jimmy Hart's doing and with all the servicemen being there, Dave wouldn't be shocked to see Hogan make an appearance and shoot an angle. But Vince Russo is apparently back involved with creative (more on that in a moment), and if that's the case, Hogan likely isn't in the cards at the moment.

- **Johnny Fairplay was revealed as this week's big TNA surprise and it flopped**. The deal was put together the day of the show by Fairplay's agent (who also represents porn star Ron Jeremy). Apparently Fairplay overheard Dixie Carter say ""give them what they want, let's make this deal happen"" and as a result, they were nickel and diming TNA until the last minute, trying to add new perks to his deal. Russo will be working on Fairplay's storylines. The crowd didn't react to the announcement at all, which caused a lot of second guessing backstage. Dave says the amount of mainstream media attention they get from this will determine if it was a good move or not, but Dave suspects not. Fairplay's mainstream star has faded significantly since Survivor. Fairplay is promising them he can get an appearance booked on Howard Stern, which TNA ""would die for"" but who knows if he can. WWE seemingly showed no interest in him.

- **UFC is said to be close to signing a deal with Spike TV for a show to air on the network**. Dana White has spoken of it and said the plan is to make it a showcase for up-and-coming fighters to try and build stars for future PPV matches (and thus The Ultimate Fighter would be born).

- **In the past 2 months, every major wrestling and MMA promotion in Japan (K-1, PRIDE, AJPW, NJPW, and NOAH) have all made an effort to get WWE talent to appear on upcoming major shows**. WWE has rejected all offers. Their current plan is to tour Japan twice a year (once with Raw, once with Smackdown) and the feeling is anything more than that would dilute the product. Furthermore, most of the offers have been to bring in one of WWE's top stars to lose to a native Japanese star, which WWE also has no interest in. For what it's worth, Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle are the two names that pretty much everyone wants to get.

- **Kurt Angle did an interview** saying he didn't think his career can survive another neck surgery and that he plans to slow down how he works. He also admitted that he had hoped to compete in the 2004 Olympics and had started to train for it, but between all his injuries, he knows he'd get his ass kicked so he decided against it.

- **Brian Kendrick asked for his WWE release this past week**. In previous weeks, he was worried about being fired so he started testing the waters to see what was out there for him. Apparently he liked what he heard enough that he said ""fuck it, let's just quit before they fire me."" So he got his release and has already signed a new deal with Zero-1 in Japan. He's also expected to work TNA dates in between Japan tours. He still has a 90-day non-compete though but that only applies for TNA. So he starts with Zero-1 this week (he returns to WWE in about a year and a half).

- **The Rock is hoping to make a surprise (whoops) appearance at Royal Rumble and has said he plans to try and clear his schedule in March so that he can work Wrestlemania**. Currently, the tentative plan for that is Rock & Mick Foley vs. Randy Orton & Batista (throw Flair in there and yeah, that's what we get). Speaking of Rock, he recently donated $10k to purchase food and other supplies for Samoa, which was recently hit by a cyclone and left a lot of people needing help.

- **The Randy Orton/Mick Foley storyline is said to be almost entirely Foley's planning, with every aspect of it planned by him**. Foley brought the idea to Vince, who greenlit it. The entire purpose of the storyline is to elevate Orton and Foley has basically made it his mission to do so with this storyline (and good lord in heaven, does it ever work).

- **Notes from 1/15 Smackdown**: the focus of this show was all about making John Cena a star, with him kind of the main focus and getting some in-ring promo time against Paul Heyman among other things. Eddie Guerrero came off as the real star of the show, as the crowd was very much into him. Speaking of, word is Eddie is main eventing No Way Out next month against Lesnar for the title. Can't imagine anything exciting will happen there. They're also teasing a slow Kurt Angle heel turn on Eddie. Main event of Cena vs. Rhyno got over good and Cena, while not great in-ring, showed a lot of good character work. By the end of the show, Cena, Benoit, and Eddie were all pushed like legit top stars.

- **Notes from 1/19 Raw**: boring show. Goldberg beat Test and Scott Steiner in a triple threat and Dave says when it's a 2-on-1 beatdown and Goldberg sells, the crowd is SUPER behind him. But if he's only selling for one person, the crowd dies. This is professional wrestling and yes, there's rules to this shit, but the crowd doesn't care. They want Goldberg to be Superman and every time WWE pushes back against that, the crowd loses interest. Also, Goldberg's beard is grey now and it really ages him. Christian tried to sabotage Jericho's blossoming relationship with Trish by showing her pictures of Jericho making out with strippers and saying he took one of them home. Goldberg won a battle royal to get the #30 spot in the upcoming Rumble. And that's about it.

- **Dave expects Benoit vs. Triple H at the Edmonton PPV in April**. Dave thinks the smart move would be to have Benoit win the title there, but makes a snide comment about Triple H ""loaning"" the belt out just so he can regain it again soon after in an effort to catch up to Flair's world title record. Have I ever mentioned that Dave doesn't seem to much care for Triple H around this time? Though to be fair, nobody did. Anyway, the world title situation with Benoit is going to work out a little bit differently than that, but we'll get there...

- **Edge is expected back after Wrestlemania**. His goal was to be back in time for the show and he is expected to be cleared right around that time, so he MIGHT be able to work the show, but WWE doesn't have any plans for him, so even if he's cleared by then, doesn't look like he'll be on the card. They feel bringing him back would result in him getting lost in the shuffle of Rock, Foley, and Undertaker all coming back at the same time and they want Edge's return to be its own big deal.

- **Notes from OVW**: Dave says Inspector Impact is great in his role, and he's big, which means he'll almost certainly be called up to the main roster before he's ready and won't get over as a result (that would be Luther Reigns and sure enough, that's EXACTLY what WWE does to him). Nick Dinsmore turned heel and basically rationalized it by saying he wasn't getting anywhere in his career as a babyface and can't pay his rent. Sure. Dave bemoans the lack of starpower in OVW right now. Recent names WWE has talked about bringing up include Mark Magnus, Chris Masters, Aaron Stevens, and Nova but none of them are really seen as ready yet.

- **Maven returned after missing a few weeks with injury** and immediately got injured again in his first match back. He underwent elbow surgery as a result and is expected to be out a few months.

I have so many and I love them all very much but I feel so terribly lonely. I am not close with anyone, I have no idea how to unmask and it’s so exhausting for me to keep up these friendships. 
I’ve been panicking since this weekend after a situation where I couldn’t make it to a friends birthday party. There’s all good reasons why I couldn’t go, out of my control, and I’m frustrated with one of my friends that was sort of pressuring me to go. We used to do fun stuff like just go on walks, get coffee, go to art exhibitions and now I feel like this friend only wants to party. And I have no idea how to even say “hey our friendship feels different!” And I don’t know if it’s worth it because they seem so much closer to other people. I can’t even tell if this person is a good person or good friend to me, which happens to me all the time but I cling super tight to my friendships and don’t realize until it’s too late that I don’t like them very much or they’re not very good to me. 

And I’m so tired of putting in a lot of work to build a friendship only to realize they are wayyyy closer to other people and be able to SEE how stunted our friendship is, probably because of me. 

I know there are a lot of autistic people that can do without a lot of socializing, but I really can’t, I feel lonely all the time and really want to connect with people and I feel so terribly defective. I have only been truly close to very few friends and that was in college before I really was masking as well, I think. And now I have no idea how to reel it back. I’ve only had one friend in recent years that I could be myself with, and it took years to get to that point. And she moved away. She recently visited and I have been a total mess since then just realizing how much more empty my social life is now that she’s gone. 

Any kind words appreciated, or advice on how to unmask, how to find better friends, anything really. I am in a group in my city for autistic adults but even that feels like a lot of effort right now and I haven’t made any friends there really. I’m feeling lost.

My boyfriend and I have been on a mission to find a coffee shop that makes a true Earl Grey latte. Our understanding is that unlike a London Fog, which is typically just steamed milk with Earl Grey and vanilla, an Earl Grey latte has an actual espresso base.

For reference, we found a coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen that makes a '[Nightingale](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PqGRZTi4CmCjntqEA),' which, in theory, is a latte with a bag of Earl Grey dipped in it. However, when we custom order this combo elsewhere, it never tastes the same.

I was holding his hand. I loved his beautiful, clever hands. I loved the soft-skinned strength of his long, thin fingers.

I looked after him in one way or another from childhood, first acting as his therapist and distraction trying to stop his depression from spiralling, then helping him end his alcoholism, then living at home as his companion so that he would still get up in the mornings, then physically stepping in to keep him clean, dressed, fed. I went through so much for him. And yet still we couldn't just TELL each other that we loved each other. I couldn't hold my dad and tell him I loved him between the ages of 12 and 32. I wasted 20 years when I could have been holding his beautiful hand. Why has society decided that an adult son can't hold his father's hand? The best I got was him guiding my hand on the chisel.

He taught me everything I know about woodwork, mechanics, restoration, turning, machining. Now I have to make his urn for him and I can't formulate how to do it without his hand on mine, showing me where to cut, how much pressure, what angle. I feel like everything I knew how to do is gone. I can't watch him do it then copy. I can't ask ""this tool or that tool?"" I'm just sitting in a coffee shop with his ashes next to me, having just picked them up. I'm trying to picture how his hands would go about this job that I need to do. But all I can think about is falling asleep holding his hand, and waking up minutes later to find he'd gone. ",9,1741020877.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Please be kind but please help me change my perspective.,"To make a long story short, my in laws got a vacation home and amped up their passion for travel about 5 and 7 years after they retired - coincidentally, the year they started expecting their first grandchild. 

Our son is 16 months old and has only met his grandparents a handful of times. They are gone 6-7 months a year at their vacation home (snowbirds, we live in Canada) and when they are home for the spring and summer seasons, they usually do a Europe trip and several cross country trips. As a result they are rarely home, but when they have been, they have very rich and busy social lives - spending their weekends at cottages with friends, going for lunches and dinners, frequently going to events etc. 

When they are home they seldom offer to babysit. The few times they have, it has to be in their home and it is for a very short time between their social plans or other obligations. They don’t even offer to visit us but insist we visit them (1 hour drive from our home to theirs) which we do. While they are away, we FaceTime once a week so our son is familiar with them. 

Husband and I have been struggling this winter. Im pregnant with baby #2, we both work full time in demanding careers, and my mom is dying of cancer and on home hospice care. Things aren’t looking good for her as of recently. We have been sick a lot, so I haven’t been able to see her or help her as much as I was on mat leave. We have virtually no support system here, just each other and daycare while we work. It’s been really rough. When we FaceTime my in laws, they never really seem to care that we’re struggling - they ask how we are doing but are “always positive” types, they sort of change the subject as soon as we say stuff is challenging for us. We haven’t had a date night in probably a year, we frequently have to say no to invitations from friends because we don’t have childcare lined up, and our son doesn’t sleep through the night still.

 My husband has straight up told them that he’s struggling with them not being present as grandparents and that he’s imagined they’d be much more involved. To which they often give some response that they’ll be home “in a few months and will babysit” (meaning once, during the week they are home, for 2 hours). My husband is quite angry with them as he had both his grandmothers in his home alternating almost every weekday for years to help his parents with cooking, cleaning and childcare so they could work. My in laws never had to pay for daycare, they came home to cooked dinner apparently several nights a week every week for years, they had babysitters whenever they needed them. My husband is jealous of this and angry that we aren’t getting nearly the same level of support. In contrast, his sister who also has young kids has several healthy in laws that live within a few blocks of her, and several friends who are SAHMs like she is. He sees how much support she gets from her family and friends and it sort of deepens his resentment towards his parents, because they know we don’t have the same level of support as their other child. 

I’m not experiencing the same type of resentment - I can appreciate they worked hard for their money and that they want to enjoy their lives. What I get resentful about is that my own mom was so excited to be a grandmother and was so helpful and supportive before her health declined. She would come visit us in a heartbeat to watch my son, or play with him, or bring us coffee and food during the newborn days, or help me tidy up or get caught up on laundry. She frequently breaks down and tells me how heartbroken she is that she can’t help us more or be there for us or spend time with her grandson the way she wants to. She is depressed about potentially not being here to meet her granddaughter. It just feels so unfair - she lives 5 minutes down the road and would spend all of her time with me and our son if I let her (I wouldn’t, I’d let her have her own life too) and would be so happy about that, but she can’t. Meanwhile our son has two healthy grandparents who rarely see him and when they do it seems to be on their terms and on a clock. 

I guess I’m looking for some perspective here. I’m so depressed about losing my mom, and I am depressed about the lack of support we’ve had. I also don’t want to expect anything of anyone because it was our choice to have children. I am not currently in therapy because, lack of time and childcare, but I do want to shift my perspective on this. I love my in laws, truly. They are kind and wonderful people. And they are genuinely great with kids when they are here, it’s just so rare. I just want to get over this resentment. I need to accept that this is just life and find some positivity or something in all of this. Or maybe I just needed to rant.

\- an area that looks historical (older beautiful buildings, not as much modern)

\- aesthetically beautiful. 

\- Extremely walkable. Can walk to local shops, cafes etc easily. Not the suburbs

1j2myen,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1j2myen/a_comprehensive_guide_to_jane_wickline_in_season/,A comprehensive guide to Jane Wickline in Season 50.,"We have 3 new featured players this year.  But none are more divisive than Jane Wickline.  People either love love love or hate hate hate what she brings to the table.  At SNL very rarely do we get cast-members who only play one time of character to one type of humor.  99% of cast-members need to be diverse in their comedy chops to be successful.

The only exceptions that come to mind are pure and only weekend update hosts (Jost/Che/Meyers).  Those hosts are known to have top-notch comedic timing and provide versatile delivery depending on the report.

I should also note early, I don’t know what Jane’s writing chops are, as we don’t know what sketches she has written.  For all I know she’s written half of the funniest sketches this year and her writing ability bought her into a performing spot. 

MY gripe with the character Wickline plays:  It’s always the same deadpan awkward monotone person who’s awkward continues to awkward but thinks they are normal.  There are a few exceptions to this (see the lifeguard sketch but in that example, they are the “straight man” and the world around them gets increasingly awkward.  I’m 90% sure she wrote/co-wrote this sketch as it fits 100% within her tiktok repertoire ) but it feels like a vast majority of her speaking roles where she has more then 4 lines, is that same character.  It’s a deadpan delivery of anti-humor which the show rarely has and when it did with say Norm McDonald it requires perfect execution in delivery and timing.  It’s well known that Wickline’s ability to speak to another character in a conversation while looking at them and not the que cards has bene an issue.

**Episode 1**

* No speaking lines in Spirit Halloween sketch.

**Episode 2**

* ·         Devil Dog’s drop (The Lifeguard sketch)
   * o   Everytime she talks she reads directly off cue card, never at a person.
   * o   This is her reverse awkard, she’s the straight-man and 2 people propose the quite funny scenario of sending a dead man down a waterslide.  They convince her co-worker it’s a good idea. 
   * o   We get a multi-sentence part where she again reads off the que cards and isn’t interacting wither the people on stage.
   * o   Doesn’t look at Devon when he’s talking and instead is just reading her an everones lines for when she speaks.
* ·         Weekend Update Song (won’t leave the party)
   * o   This Brings me to my annoyance of Jane doing 1-trick pony work of awkward situation intensifies into more awkward.
   * o   Basis of the Song
      * §  Hook 1 – 2Am party’s strong but lights on DJ packs up, pretending dance is getting bigger while its ending
      * §  Hook 2 – Pretending Partys’ bumping, asked if needs a ride home,
      * §  Hook 2 – Repeat “I am the plus one of someone who has left”
      * o   Continues to pretend it’s still a party in more awkward situations of pretending its still a party.
   * o   It feels like just a tiktok video.  Wickline glances at Jost ones but can’t talk to him while looking at him.  This is the first real instance we get of hitting the “make more awkard button”. 

**Episode 3**

* Charades
   * Jane is bookended lines int this episode as what I believe was an afterthought, as she had no other sketches this episode.  Her lines don’t drive the story but gets her in the scene.

**Episode 4**

* ·         TikTok –  Said “thank you for the roses yum” twice ….

**Episode 5**

* ·         Port Authority sketch, No speaking Lines
* Weekend Update – “The Couple you Can’t believe are Together” w/ Marcello Hernandez
   * o   We again get Wickline acting like the awkward one, eyes darting around, monotone.
   * o   This sketch’s payoff is supposed to be Jane dropping the awkward, and toss a mean-bitch shutdown of a hussy.
   * o   Reads a sad poem and breaks a few times.
   * o   The breaking takes off what is supposed to be the payoff for her character in the end.  The stinger landed but nearly as well as it should have.

**Episode 6**

* Trauma Support Group
   * 2 Lines – The First one reading off cue card.  Not engaging with the active group.  2nd one is read looking at que card instead of Yang saying “You can’t smoke in here Samuel”.

**Episode 7**

* Acting Teacher
   * One line “would you grab me a cup of your finest coffee”  Again, straight que card reading but FWIW this time Devon Walker also acted poorly…. Maybe this was part of the sketch??
* It Girl Thanksgiving
   * MaryKate-Ashly Olson ipersonation….. 1 line, was very meh and did not stand out.  Forgot that was even in the sketch.

**Episode 8**

* Gladitor Pre-Tapedd
   * Had a 20-30 second voice-over of her acting. Hanging up cloths.  The lip-sync was bad but that’s on production I’m pretty sure.
* Please Don’t destroy
   * Came in at the end saying  “Hey guys did you want to write the, uh” and turns around.  Not much on the bone to work off of there.

**Episode 9**

* Mall Santas – Had a one line of “Hi, ho ho ho” in her signature monotone voice.
* Weekend Update (Sabrina Song)
   * We again get Jane not being able to look and talk to the person she’s interacting with.  When talking to Collin she’s reading off the cue cards.
   * Song flips of celebs getting called gay/lesbian for nuanced things while sabrina made out with Ortega & a female alien and no one calls lesbian.  This all culminates with her (wickline/SC) wanting to have secrets.
   * A lot of monotone singing with an awkward premise getting hammerd.
* Office Party
   * One Line about being Shy/Awkward Girl.  Not much as it’s a pretape.
* Blind Date
   * Background

**Episode 10**

* An Act of Kindness – “Pre-Taped” 1 line
* Christmas Airport Parade – 2 lines, never once looks at Martin Short (he looks at her),  more/less just stares at cue cards
* Peanuts Christmas – No spoken lines

**Episode 11**

*  Pop the Balloon – Pretaped
   * One line, can’t get much from it.

**Episode 12**

* Weekend Update (Love Song with Trolly Problem)
   * AGAIN, can’t look at Collin when reading her lines.  Pure Cue cards.
   * Hook 1 – 80% love song 20% Trolly problem (awkward)
   * Hook 2 – All Trolly Problem, existential crisis of would you actively kill 5 to save one vs no action to keep 1 alive. (awkward intensifies)
   * Hook 3 – Hook-2 would cause suicide because of guilt for any deaths.
   * Intermission – gets called out for it being Trolly Problem (Awkward continues to intensify)
   * Hook 4 – Awkward intensifies about holding girl captive and not letting them do anything dangerously and accidently gets back into a trolly problem.
   * We get the same formula reused on a different story.  Take an awkward thing and hammer the ever loving crap out of it.

Jane’s season so far is 3 Weekend Update Songs, 1 Weekend Update Skit with Marcello, 1 featured acting spot in episode 2, and 1liners.  Her lack of ability to look at others while saying lines is very troublesome, there’s no comfort in acting with others.  Everything can’t just be awkward character driven.

She’s only made it to show when playing an awkward character whose usually monotone/off-key.  The humor is usually anti-humor mixed with dry to the bone.  Without a high level of comedic timing it’s a recipe for failure.  Even when given very little dialoge there’s difficulty delivering the lines to other cast-members and not just reading the line that needs to be read directly off the cue card.  This takes me out of the moment of those acting together.

I just think it was a swing and a miss of  castmember choice.  I think going back to the tictok well isn’t a bad idea but they’ll need to find someone with more charisma and bit more multifaceted.  This brings me to the realization that SNL might not have anyone else who can play and perform an instrument.

What’s frustrating when watching is that someone like Sarah Sherman gets to perform her wacky characters but also plays it straight when asked.  She can play/perform a wide variety of people, much like other cast members.  Emil is showing to be able to act with others and just had a 1:1 with the host which he did rather well in.  I can not see Jane doing a 1:1 scene especially when her character has to be something other than the awkward one because the awkward person doesn’t always need to lookat others when talking (because they are awkard).

If you like her WU stuff, that's great.  It's alright to like what you like but it's also alright for me to be displeased when I can't get past her doing the same thing over and over.  What's harder is that this feels like something that's made for YT/TT and not for a primetime show.

Go ahead, chew me up.  Tell me it’s not fair to rag on someone but I haven’t seen a cast member contribute so little to group-work in a long time.  It’s a bit frustrating to watch a show and have someone stick out when the other cast is doing what’s needed of them.",0,1741020121.0,LiveFromNewYork,39,0.44,False
1j2mxhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1j2mxhx/easy_freestyle_mattar_paneer/,easy freestyle mattar paneer,"the ny times mattar peneer recipe was the starting point of it. Really recommend it if you want smth solid but beginner friendly. (The recipe is under paywall but other websites copied the recipe + watch the ny times youtube video maybe)

But over time, i simplified it even more. Tbh its not strict and very much a gut feeling thing, you can replace ingredients with whatever you have of that kind (eg tomato paste, tomato sauce, fresh cut tomatoes, a mixture of all- you get it)

Must haves imo: _frozen peas_ (just fresher, crispier and sweeter), _store bought paneer_ cheese (homemade is easy, but i would need over 2l of milk for my preferred amount and its not firm enough), _cumin_(powder for me), _tumeric_, _chili powder/flakes/pepper_, _garam masala_, and _garlic_ -and _ginger paste_ .

No ginger is ok too, but it adds a solidness, smth almost meaty and smoky. 

#Really simplified procedure:

onions in pan with olive oil or (better) ghee, add salt, a good amount of ginger and garlic paste and cook till onions translucent.
Add cumin, turmeric and chili, let it fry in the oil.
Now either tomato paste (the whole thing gets thicker and fruity, i rlly like it) with water, tomato sauce and fresh tomatoes with salt and let it cook a bit. I like to add much tomato-whatever-basis for amount and fruity flavor.
Now add cut paneer (no need to fry it first, it gets rlly hard and dry, and for beginners it sticks to easily on the pan, so just leave it, it will be soft and still tasty), stir. 
NOW: either you have cashew butter, add 2 good tablespoons, or you have cashews- then grind them back to back to fine powder in an electric coffee grinder (you rlly want them fine powdered) 
Add the powder into small pot, add ghee/butter/oil, let it roast a bit in pot till thick paste. So add smth chashew-y OR NOT. I did it without any today and its fine- but less creamy and 'rich' maybe. But its rlly ok! Leave it out. 
Add frozen peas- these add such a characteristic taste, sweet and freshness. 
With cashew in, i like to add nothing (but you can of course), but without cashew, I'll add a bit of heavy cream, or milk or coconut milk. 
Add a bit garam masala- the sweeter the better imo. 
Let it cool a bit and serve with withe rice.
It gets better the more everything combines and sits.

But the story and pacing is pretty immaculate, it's rare you get a good watch full of insane action every now and then. Especially from Netflix of all things. They really cooked with this show, that's all I'd like to say.

Anyways, here is the Bee Movie Script because of the 500 character minimum:

    According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
    The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
    Ooh, black and yellow!
    Let's shake it up a little.
    Barry! Breakfast is ready!
    Coming!
    Hang on a second.
    Hello?
    Barry?
    Adam?
    Can you believe this is happening?
    I can't.
    I'll pick you up.
    Looking sharp.
    Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
    Sorry. I'm excited.
    Here's the graduate.
    We're very proud of you, son.
    A perfect report card, all B's.
    Very proud.
    Ma! I got a thing going here.
    You got lint on your fuzz.
    Ow! That's me!
    Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
    Bye!
    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
    Hey, Adam.
    Hey, Barry.
    Is that fuzz gel?
    A little. Special day, graduation.
    Never thought I'd make it.
    Three days grade school, three days high school.
    Those were awkward.
    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
    You did come back different.
    Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
    Hear about Frankie?
    Yeah.
    You going to the funeral?
    No, I'm not going.
    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
    Don't waste it on a squirrel.
    Such a hothead.
    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
    That's why we don't need vacations.
    Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
    Well, Adam, today we are men.
    We are!
    Bee-men.
    Amen!
    Hallelujah!
    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
    Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
    That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
    Will we pick our job today?
    I heard it's just orientation.
    Heads up! Here we go.
    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
    Wonder what it'll be like?
    A little scary.
    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
    This is it!
    Wow.
    Wow.
    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
    Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
    That girl was hot.
    She's my cousin!
    She is?
    Yes, we're all cousins.
    Right. You're right.
    At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
    What do you think he makes?
    Not enough.
    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
    What does that do?
    Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
    Saves us millions.
    Can anyone work on the Krelman?
    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
    But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
    But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
    What's the difference?
    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
    So you'll just work us to death?
    We'll sure try.
    Wow! That blew my mind!
    ""What's the difference?""
    How can you say that?
    One job forever?
    That's an insane choice to have to make.
    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
    Why would you question anything? We're bees.
    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
    Like what? Give me one example.
    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
    Wait a second. Check it out.
    Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
    Wow.
    I've never seen them this close.
    They know what it's like outside The Hive.
    Yeah, but some don't come back.
    Hey, Jocks!
    Hi, Jocks!
    You guys did great!
    You're monsters!
    You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
    I wonder where they were.
    I don't know.
    Their day's not planned.
    Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
    You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
    Right.
    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
    It's just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it.
    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
    Those ladies?
    Aren't they our cousins too?
    Distant. Distant.
    Look at these two.
    Couple of Hive Harrys.
    Let's have fun with them.
    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
    Oh, my!
    I never thought I'd knock him out.
    What were you doing during this?
    Trying to alert the authorities.
    I can autograph that.
    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
    Yeah. Gusty.
    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
    Six miles, huh?
    Barry!
    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
    Maybe I am.
    You are not!
    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
    What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough?
    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
    Hey, Honex!
    Dad, you surprised me.
    You decide what you're interested in?
    Well, there's a lot of choices.
    But you only get one.
    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
    Son, let me tell you about stirring.
    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
    You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It's a beautiful thing.
    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
    Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
    I'm not trying to be funny.
    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
    You're gonna be a stirrer?
    No one's listening to me!
    Wait till you see the sticks I have.
    I could say anything right now.
    I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
    Let's open some honey and celebrate!
    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
    I'm so proud.
    We're starting work today!
    Today's the day.
    Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
    Yeah, right.
    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
    Is it still available?
    Hang on. Two left!
    One of them's yours! Congratulations!
    Step to the side.
    What'd you get?
    Picking crud out. Stellar!
    Wow!
    Couple of newbies?
    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
    Make your choice.
    You want to go first?
    No, you go.
    Oh, my. What's available?
    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
    Any chance of getting the Krelman?
    Sure, you're on.
    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
    Wax monkey's always open.
    The Krelman opened up again.
    What happened?
    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
    Oh, this is so hard!
    Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
    Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
    Barry!
    All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
    What happened to you?
    Where are you?
    I'm going out.
    Out? Out where?
    Out there.
    Oh, no!
    I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
    You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
    Another call coming in.
    If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
    Hey, guys.
    Look at that.
    Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
    Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
    It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
    Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
    Sign here, here. Just initial that.
    Thank you.
    OK.
    You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
    So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
    Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
    Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
    That's awful.
    And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
     All right, launch positions!
    Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
    Black and yellow!
    Hello!
    You ready for this, hot shot?
    Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
    Wind, check.
    Antennae, check.
    Nectar pack, check.
    Wings, check.
    Stinger, check.
    Scared out of my shorts, check.
    OK, ladies,
    let's move it out!
    Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
    All of you, drain those flowers!
    Wow! I'm out!
    I can't believe I'm out!
    So blue.
    I feel so fast and free!
    Box kite!
    Wow!
    Flowers!
    This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
    Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
    Roses!
    30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
    Stand to the side, kid.
    It's got a bit of a kick.
    That is one nectar collector!
    Ever see pollination up close?
    No, sir.
    I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
    See that? It's a little bit of magic.
    That's amazing. Why do we do that?
    That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
    Cool.
    I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
    Copy that visual.
    Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
    Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
    Affirmative.
    That was on the line!
    This is the coolest. What is it?
    I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
    It smells good.
    Not like a flower, but I like it.
    Yeah, fuzzy.
    Chemical-y.
    Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
    My sweet lord of bees!
    Candy-brain, get off there!
    Problem!
    Guys!
    This could be bad.
    Affirmative.
    Very close.
    Gonna hurt.
    Mama's little boy.
    You are way out of position, rookie!
    Coming in at you like a missile!
    Help me!
    I don't think these are flowers.
    Should we tell him?
    I think he knows.
    What is this?!
    Match point!
    You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
    Yowser!
    Gross.
    There's a bee in the car!
    Do something!
    I'm driving!
    Hi, bee.
    He's back here!
    He's going to sting me!
    Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
    He blinked!
    Spray him, Granny!
    What are you doing?!
    Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
    I gotta get home.
    Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
    Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
    Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
    What was that?
    Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
    That is diabolical.
    It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
    What's number one? Star Wars?
    Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
    No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
    When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
    There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
    I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
    I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
    Wait! Stop! Bee!
    Stand back. These are winter boots.
    Wait!
    Don't kill him!
    You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
    Why does his life have less value than yours?
    Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
    I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
    My brochure!
    There you go, little guy.
    I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
     Put that on your resume brochure.
    My whole face could puff up.
    Make it one of your special skills.
    Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
    Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
    Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
    Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
    You could put carob chips on there.
    Bye.
    Supposed to be less calories.
    Bye.
    I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
    All right, here it goes.
    Nah.
    What would I say?
    I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
    I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
    Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
    No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
    How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
    Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
    Hi!
    I'm sorry. You're talking.
    Yes, I know.
    You're talking!
    I'm so sorry.
    No, it's OK. It's fine.
    I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
    Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
    This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!

    Yeah.

    I just want to say I'm grateful.

    Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    What?

    Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
    That's very funny.
    Yeah.

I have two other cheapo aluminum Moka pots that brew perfectly using medium fine grind, hot water in the chamber, and a leveled off (but not compressed) basket.

1j2mqz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1j2mqz5/looking_for_ideas_to_celebrate_my_birthday/,Looking for Ideas to Celebrate My Birthday Without Overwhelming Anxiety,"Hi, I (26F) have always had a lot of anxiety around my birthday. I’ve never really celebrated it, and the thought of doing so causes me a lot of stress. In my early 20s, I tried organizing something with friends, but it always ended up with people flaking. I would be left sitting alone in a restaurant surrounded by empty chairs, which just made the whole experience feel worse.

My family has often forgotten my birthday or remembers it too late, so I’ve just gotten used to skipping it altogether. I’d treat myself to a nice coffee from a local shop and move on with my day.

Lately, though, I’ve been feeling like I want to do something different for my birthday, but I’m overwhelmed with anxiety about it. The problem is, I don’t have many friends, and I haven’t even told the few I have when my birthday is because I’m afraid of setting myself up for disappointment. Past experiences have left me feeling like no one really cares, and I’d rather avoid the heartache.

I’ve been considering doing something for myself this year, maybe with my fiancé (26M). I love celebrating his birthday – I go all out, booking us a hotel for the weekend to visit somewhere he’s wanted to go, decorating with balloons, getting a big cake, and making the whole thing special. I enjoy planning these things and seeing him happy, but when it comes to my own birthday, the anxiety is overwhelming. There’s a lot of emotional baggage tied to it, and I tend to avoid doing anything because of the hurt it brings up. If I’m not crying or sitting alone in a restaurant, I honestly consider the day a success.

My fiancé has been trying to plan something fun for me, but my anxiety around birthdays makes it hard for him to figure out what would work. Someone at work suggested a spa day, but I already get massage benefits through work and prefer seeing my regular therapist, so that suggestion doesn’t feel quite right for me.

I’m really struggling with how to handle my birthday this year, and I’d love to hear from others who might have similar experiences. Does anyone have ideas for ways I can celebrate without triggering my anxiety or past disappointments? I’m open to anything, but I need something that feels manageable and doesn’t add to the emotional stress.

For some context, I live right outside of Toronto, Ontario, and I have a budget of around $500.

1j2mqxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j2mqxw/brew_variables_and_theory_discussion_pressure_vs/,Brew Variables and Theory Discussion: pressure vs flow restriction,"*Just as a disclaimer: I'm looking only for a very theoretical discussion concerning an espresso machine, X, that does not exist and has imaginary knobs that one could tweak in every which way to get your desired cup of coffee. I don't care if such a machine can't practically exist.* I may have a few follow up threads if there's enough engagement / interest. If you know of a better forum for this type of discussion, let me know.

I'm looking to discuss the effect of pressure vs flow rate to achieve the desired level of extraction all other factors being equal. I know pressurized porta filters are a thing, but that is not what I'm looking to discuss as these expect to have a different grind size compared to a standard porta filter. If there are factors that I've forgot to mention that would be important to the thought experiment please mention them, but also try to answer the question as though they had already been addressed (even if that is not practically possible).

Setup A: we have a non-pressurised porta filter with a puck prepped correctly to get the desired extraction. Let's assume we can know the exact pressure profile and liquid flow, while the shot is extracted.

Setup B: Let's assume there was a basket that would allow us to perfectly match the pre-infusion time, and the flow rate of *Setup A* and that the grounds in this basket are not pressed into a dense puck (at least not at first). To negate the effect of grounds expanding and holding water, we can assume that machine X is able to compress the grounds and expell excess water at the correct pressure to match the amount of liquid extracted over the brew time. (We'd use the same grind setting for both setups). This assumes there is a perfectly controllable outlet valve and another perfectly controllable volume inside the brewing chamber.

Would there be any way to differentiate the shots? Or is there something inherent in the puck structure that would manifest a difference?

The obvious thing I can think of is that in *Setup B* the extraction of each piece of coffee ground might be more even as they could be in suspension in the beginning and each particle could in theory be exposed to the same amount of water. In addition, each part of the liquid solution would have essentially the same concentration of soluble materials, whereas in *Setup A* you'd get an extraction gradient (I'm assuming the grounds at the bottom of the puck might be less extracted than they are at the top of the puck, due to the solution concentration increasing as it passes through the puck, although some of this would be mitigated through a different amount of pre-infusion).

If this were the case, I'd assume *Setup B* would have higher clarity (and I'd assume that beyond a point too much clarity may not be a good thing?). I think other than that, I'd assume that the crema would be about the same, since the pressure is what dictates the ability of CO2 to dissolve in a volume of water and the same pressure profile would be achieved.

Do you think this is a correct assesment? Do you think something else would happen? Let me know!! :)",1,1741019604.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

These dates have been casual coffees - no kissing or getting physical. 

I am very top heavy (busty) and quite often compared to Sofia Vergara - I’m worried maybe I’m giving the wrong impression? 

I’m just feeling low and quite alone.

I’m looking for some advice on how to **best monetize my TikTok page** while staying authentic to my content and audience.

I run a TikTok account called *By\_Forever and Always*, where I share **journal entries, poems, and personal reflections on grief and healing.** Over time, my page has grown to over **20,000 followers**, and I receive daily messages from people who resonate with my content and find comfort in it. It has become a real **community for those navigating grief**, and I want to continue building it in a meaningful way.

I’ve already tried a few monetization methods, including:

* **An eBook of my poems and journal entries** (no sales so far).
* **An Etsy store with digital products** – but sales have been slow.
* **Blog posts-** Not paid just for support to those that need it as I love writing and I love helping others but not many people have read these. 

I’m now considering **starting a paid grief support community** (maybe through TikTok’s subscription feature or Patreon) where people can share their experiences, attend live discussions, and receive exclusive content.

For those who have successfully monetized a **personal brand or emotional support niche**, I’d love to hear your insights!

* What are the best monetization strategies that align with an **authentic, supportive space**?
* Has anyone used **Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, or similar platforms** effectively?
* How can I turn my TikTok engagement into something sustainable without losing trust with my audience?

I truly want to **offer value while making this a long-term project**. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 💛",0,1741019437.0,authors,2,0.22,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’ve recently learned through my mother that he thinks his neighbors are spying on him. He says that they fly drones over his house, drop chemicals down his chimney, change the locks in his house, and a lot of other insane stuff. He’s showing the early signs of dementia or another medical condition. However, my Grandma won’t do anything about it because my Grandfather gets angry at her and says “You don’t believe me!” when she suggests otherwise. It’s a safety issue because he has guns in the house and now he leaves his handgun out on the coffee table and sleeps with his shotgun under his bed. 

I’m terrified that he’s going to shoot my Grandma in the middle of the night if he mistakes her for an “intruder”. My mom doesn’t want to get involved because he’s not her biological dad and she isn’t close with him. But no one will stand up and demand that he needs to be assessed by a doctor. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I’m 33F, but my Grandma has no idea that I know any of this because she asked my mom not to tell me so I feel weird getting involved too. How can we convince him that he needs to be assessed by a doctor? Thanks ",1,1741019357.0,DementiaHelp,0,1.0,False

1j2mktz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j2mktz/looking_for_birthday_ideas_after_years_of/,Looking for Birthday Ideas After Years of Avoiding Celebrations,"
Hi, I (26F) have never really celebrated my birthday. In my early 20s, I tried organizing something with friends, but it always ended with people flaking, and I ended up sitting alone in a restaurant surrounded by empty chairs.

Even my family often forgets my birthday, or they remember it too late. As a result, I’ve usually just skipped celebrating altogether. I’ll get myself a nice drink from a coffee shop and call it a day.

Lately, though, I’ve been thinking about doing something different. The problem is, I don’t have many friends, and I haven’t shared my birthday with the ones I do have because, in the past, no one has really cared, and I just don’t want to set myself up for disappointment again.

I’ve been thinking of doing something for myself, maybe just with my fiancé (26m) I love celebrating his birthday – I go all out, get us a hotel for the weekend to visit somewhere he’s mentioned wanting to go, decorate with balloons, get a big cake, and make it a special event. I love planning these things and seeing him happy.

But with my own birthday, there’s a lot of emotional baggage. I tend to avoid the day because it brings up a lot of past hurt. I don’t have any particular wants or desires for it – honestly, if I’m not crying or sitting alone in a restaurant, I consider it a success.

My fiancé has been trying to plan something fun for me, but he’s struggling because of how I feel about birthdays. Someone at work suggested a spa day, but I already get massage benefits through work and prefer seeing my regular therapist rather than just getting a random massage.

So, I’m wondering – does anyone have any ideas for how I can make my birthday more enjoyable this year? I’m open to anything. 

Some background if it helps, I live right outside of Toronto (Ontario, Canada). I have a budget of about $500. ",1,1741019190.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1j2mksc,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1j2mksc/saga_of_the_most_hated_man_in_our_office/,Saga of the most hated man in our office,"I have posted about him before, not sure if it was in this group or another. I work for a very small company. We \*just\* got an HR department. This guy is someone we all call asswipe face. Because he is a ginormous asshole. He's also the owner/boss's best friend since 3rd grade, so he gets away with all of his bullshit. I am working on my resume and getting a few things taken care of, then I'm looking for a new position.

But I just had to vent about what happened this morning. Asswipe face is probably the messiest, dirtiest person I have ever encountered in a workplace. He used to leave his dishes and mess all over our old office and we eventually got a mice infestation. I used to clean up after him often because our office was so small, I had no way of avoiding his mess and I couldn't warm up my lunch or wash my dishes without his mess being in the way. Ever since we moved into a bigger office, I can easily avoid his mess- we have a much bigger kitchen, and a lot of his mess is now relegated to his own office upstairs.

And in general, I no longer clean up after him. I no longer wipe up his crumbs or wash his dishes. However, we do not have a trash service at this office. We set the trash on the front porch and every day, the boss/owner of the company throws it in the back of his truck and takes it out. Myself and one other lady in the office take out the trash every day, sometimes more than once a day. 

This morning, he comes in late, sees there is no coffee, and starts bitching about how no one makes coffee anymore (only myself, him, and the owner drink coffee and I already had my coffee this morning because I get here at the start of our office hours; boss won't be in today, so I didn't make any). Then, he says, ""Well, no one else wants to take out the trash, so I might as well be the one to do it!""

I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS MAN TAKE OUT THE TRASH BEFORE IN THE 3 YEARS WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER! The fucking audacity! Imma start taking the trash out to his damn office. Not really but UGH.",2,1741019187.0,work,0,0.75,False

1j2mkl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1j2mkl3/office_hero_chapter_3/,Office Hero - Chapter 3,"Greg guided Ben to his new domain: the Mail Room. It festered in the building’s bowels, a crypt of witchlight hum and forgotten parcels. Ben stood at its threshold, nostrils flaring at the stench of dust, stale alchemical sludge, and defeat. Towers of unmarked boxes teetered like siege engines abandoned mid-assault. A steel steed (forklift) sat dormant, its prongs rusted and bowed—like a toothless wolf in a den of mice.

The room’s sole guardian snored at a desk buried under mountains of mis-sorted scrolls (mail). The man—Garry, his nametag read—was a mound of flesh and flannel. His jowls quivering with each wet, guttural snore. A rivulet of drool pooled around a half-eaten doughnut fossilized to a memo pad labeled “URGENT: 2017 Tax Documents.”

“You!” Ben’s voice shook the cobwebbed rafters. “Rise, sentry! Your post is overrun!”

Garry’s snores deepened, punctuated by a phlegmy choke. Ben seized a nearby gavel (a stapler) and slammed it on the desk. The doughnut crumbled to dust. Garry snorted, smacked his lips, and resumed his slumber.

“Deaf as a tombstone,” Ben muttered, leaning closer, ""And twice as useful.""

Ben stalked the mail room’s aisles like a general surveying a plague-ravaged camp. The air in the realm hung with the musk of neglect, every breath a lungful of parchment rot. His boots crunched over the carcasses of rubber bands and brittle packing tape as he cataloged the room’s sins:

The “Fragile” Bin:

A sarcophagus of folly. Shredded packing peanuts spilled over its edges like snow atop a mass grave. At its center lay a headless garden gnome, one chipped hand still raised in a cheery wave. Ben crouched, turning the figure over. “A warrior felled by decapitation,” he muttered, the gnome’s vacant stare mirroring his disdain. “Your clan abandoned you to this stygian pit. Rest now, little sentinel.”

The Pallet of 2018:

A monolith of incompetence. Envelopes—yellowed and bloated with moisture—had fused into a single, sagging slab. Ben dragged a finger across its surface, dislodging a beetle that scuttled into the shadows. “Scrolls of a fallen era,” he growled. “Their secrets have moldered, their senders forgotten. A tomb for ink and idiocy.”

The “Phone”:

A relic of a dead crusade. The device crouched on a desk like a mummified toad, its receiver dangling by a cord frayed to gutstring thinness. The base was crusted with hieroglyphs of neglect—coffee rings older than interns, fossilized cheese dust, and a sticky patch that reeked of citrus-flavored regret. Ben lifted the receiver, and a family of silverfish spilled from the earpiece. “Your lines are severed,” he declared. “Your battles… unanswered.”

The “Live Nudes” Box:

Ben’s boot connected with the crate, sending it skidding into a wall. The cardboard split, unleashing a skittering horde of spiders. “Invaders!” he barked, seizing a nearby scroll tube (mailing tube) to crush the eight-legged marauders. “This outpost is compromised!”

The Filing Cabinet:

A tower of hubris. Ben wrenched open the drawer, unleashing an avalanche of paperwork that buried him to the knees. Tax forms sliced his arms like paper blades; a family of silverfish rained down, their antennae twitching in the fluorescent glare. Amidst the carnage fluttered a postcard—sun-bleached and warped, its palm-tree vista defaced by Chad’s looping scrawl: “Wish you were here! - Management Retreat, 2016.”

Ben plucked it from the rubble, his thumb smearing the ink. “A chieftain’s mockery,” he rumbled. “Penned while his kin rotted in this purgatory.” His boot heel ground the card into the tiles, grinding paradise to pulp.

\*\*\*\*\*

The forklift’s engine snarled to life, its rusty growl echoing through the mail room’s cavernous belly. Ben stood tall in the saddle (driver’s seat), his hands gripping the wheel like the reins of a warhorse. “We ride at dawn, steel steed!” he bellowed, slamming the gearshift forward. The machine lurched, skewering a pallet of “Confidential” parcels with its prongs. Boxes exploded in a shower of packing slips and decade-old memos.

Garry jolted awake, his beard raining powdered sugar and doughnut shrapnel. “Wha—? Who—? Overtime?” he slurred, blinking at the carnage.

“War,” Ben corrected, steering the forklift in a tight arc around Garry’s desk. “And you, sloth-lord, will serve.”

Garry blinked, farted audibly, and reached for a fresh doughnut. “M’break’s til 10.”

Ben’s eye twitched. “So be it,” he snarled, revving the engine. “I’ll forge order from this chaos—after I rally a war council!”

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Ben stormed through the office like a hurricane in steel-toed boots. Searching for one soul that had the look and feel of a true warrior. 

Greg was first—cornered in a supply closet, stress-eating gummy bears. “Ben! Hi! I was just, uh, inventorying—”

“Your ledger-balancing ends now,” Ben declared, hauling him out by his tie. “The mail room demands tribunes.”

Kellen froze mid-Slack message, fingers hovering over his keyboard like a startled vole. “D-dude, I’ve got a deadline—”

“Death comes for us all,” Ben intoned, tossing him over his shoulder. “Today, you live.”

Lisa didn’t flinch when Ben kicked open the lobby doors. “Concierge service is over,” she drawled, not looking up from her nails.

“You mistake me for a guest,” Ben said. “You are scout-general now.”

The Intern (name: Dylan? Tyler?) was found weeping in the stairwell, clutching a shattered coffee carafe. “They called my pivot tables ‘cute’—”

“Tears are rations for the weak,” Ben said, hoisting him up. “Today, you bleed productivity.”

The Mail room Musters:

Ben climbed atop the forklift, his boots scraping against the rusted steel, and raised his mug. The witchlights flickered, casting his shadow like a war banner across the mountains of ruined parcels.

“Warriors!” His voice boomed, shaking dust from the rafters.

“You stand in the rotten heart of this realm—a fortress besieged by chaos, its walls crumbling, its defenders asleep!” He jabbed the knife toward Garry, who snorted mid-snore, a doughnut chunk tumbling from his lips.

Greg hyperventilated into a UPS bag, his face the color of printer paper. “I think I’m having a—”

“A revelation!” Ben thundered, cutting him off. 

“For too long, this keep has festered! Scrolls lost to the abyss! Beasts of iron left to rust!” He kicked a shattered monitor, sending sparks cascading over Kellen, who yelped and dropped a stack of misrouted mail. 

“But no more! Today, we carve order from this entropy! Today, we become the spearpoint of destiny!”

Lisa rolled her eyes, filing a nail to a lethal point. “Destiny’s got a 401(k) and dental, right?”

Ben leapt down, looming over her. “You mistake purpose for payroll, scribe. What is life but a ledger of deeds? When the bards sing of this day, will they croon of copays… or courage?”

The room fell silent, save for the intern’s muffled whimpers. Ben turned to him, slicing the caution tape near an OSHA violation with a flourish. “Rise, young squire! Your pivot tables are but kindling. Today, you wield fire!” He thrust a lighter into the intern’s shaking hand.

“But—but…”

“All great pyres begin with a spark!” Ben wheeled back to the group, his cloak (Old curtain) flaring. “To the nay-sayers, we are misfits! To the blind, we are mad! But I say—we are the fulcrum! The edge! The unseen hand that strangles entropy!”

Greg peeked out from his UPS bag. “Ben, the fire extinguisher’s expired if a fire starts—”

“A blessing!” Ben roared. “For now, even flames heed our cause!”

The HVAC turned on—a guttural, grinding screech. Ben spun toward the sound, mug gleaming. “Hear that, comrades? The beast mocks our resolve! It thinks us crushed beneath its paper hooves! But we… we are the avalanche!”

He slammed his fist onto the pallet of 2018 mail, sending a cloud of silverfish scattering. “Greg! Chronicle our conquests upon these scrolls of triumph!” He hurled a fistful of shipping labels. Greg caught one, blinked at the barcode, and accidentally stuck it to his forehead, shaking his head.

“Kellen!” Ben tossed a shattered printer drum at him. “Forge from these ruins a siege engine! Let every jam and paper cut be a war cry!”

Kellen stared at the debris, then slowly began threading a USB cable through the wreckage like a fuse.

“Lisa!” Ben unsheathed a letter opener and slapped it into her palm. “You are our blade in the dark! Let the taverns (break rooms) buzz with tales of your cuts!”

Lisa arched a brow, then speared a stack of unopened HR complaints. “...Sure. Let’s stab bureaucracy.”

“And you!” Ben hauled the intern to his feet. “Your fire will light the beacon! Let Chad’s kingdom blaze with our glory!”

The intern hiccuped, flicking the lighter. A tiny flame sputtered to life. “I-I’m ready to… burn?”

“LOUDER!”

“BURN!” the intern squeaked.

Ben raised his mug to the air. “The scribes will sing of this hour! Of the War Council that rose from dust! Of the beast that fell to stamps! To victory!”

“To… victory?” Greg whispered, peeling the shipping label off his nose.

“TO VICTORY!” Ben roared.

A half-hearted murmur rippled through the group. Garry belched in his sleep.

The mail room door shuddered under three sharp knocks—a rhythm more akin to a siege battering ram than a polite request. Ben wheeled toward the sound, mug raised. “Who dares—”

The door swung open, revealing a woman carved from a battlefield, marbled with armor (tailored pantsuit) gleaming under the flickering witchlights, every seam sharp enough to draw blood. Her hair swept into a tight siege engine of a bun, eyes like twin daggers honed on corporate audits, she surveyed the carnage with a gaze that could flay weak wills to the bone. 

“Benginold?” Her voice was a whetstone dragged across steel. “Chad approved my restructuring request. Effective immediately, this…”—she paused, nostrils flaring at the smoldering tax files and silverfish diaspora—“…unit is temporarily designated Logistical Reconnaissance Division. Personnel reassigned, pay grades unchanged.”

Greg peeled a shipping label off his cheek. “Wait, we’re stuck here? But I’m HR—”

“You’re expendable,” the woman said, flipping open a clipboard forged from what looked like dragonhide (vegan leather). “I’m Jenavive Harken. Your tactical liaison. Call me Jenny if you enjoy unemployment.”

Ben’s eyes narrowed, assessing. Her stance betrayed training—weight balanced on the balls of her feet, shoulders loose but ready. A quill (pen) tucked behind her ear, ink black as a starless night. A warrior-scribe, then. Worthy.

“Jenny,” Ben rumbled, lowering his mug. “You bear the stench of command.”

“And you reek of arson and poor life choices,” she said, toeing the charred tax box. “But Chad insists you’re disruptive enough to warrant oversight.”

Lisa snorted. “So you’re our babysitter?”

Jenny’s gaze sliced to her. “I’m the scalpel excising this tumor of incompetence. You’ll address me as Commander or Ma’am. Your whining stays in the break room with your emoji mugs.”

The intern raised a trembling hand. “Wh-what’s our mission?”

Jenny’s smile was a garrote wire. “To unfuck this dystopian origami project.” She turned to Ben, tossing him a brass key stamped with the Council of Seekers’ sigil—a tower encircled by quills. “Chad’s terms: Fix the mailroom, and the Tower’s next.”

“War Council!” he roared, slamming the key onto a pallet. “Meet your general!”

Greg whispered to Kellen, “Are we the good guys?”

“We’re the employed,” Kellen squeaked.

“I think, I burned the tax files accidentally,” the intern said.

Jenny snapped her clipboard shut. “First order: Incinerate anything older than Chad’s last haircut. Second: Silence that godsdamned printer.” Her eyes locked on Ben. “You. With me. We strategize in my office.”

Ben grinned, teeth glinting.

As they marched over to the break room, the intern leaned toward Lisa. “Is Jenny… scarier than Ben?”

Lisa lit a cigarette off the smoldering tax box while Greg prepared the fire extinguisher. “Nah. Just better dressed.”

I used to work in an office environment with a lot of peers and it was awesome. I really liked going out to grab a coffee with a coworker and talking about random things, sometimes getting deeper, and forming friendships. There was something really special about having some good chats and support throughout the work day, even if I had other relationships/friendships in my life.

I've since moved jobs and while there are many improvements, I haven't found the same level of friendships, and the job can be quite isolating. It would be lovely to make a few, even virtually.

Friendships are really important in both good times and bad times, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to be able to support one another. Truth be told that today is not the best of days, but I think that is all the more reason to pursue more meaningful friendships.

Hey Reddit!

So here I am, a 40 - something guy, throwing my hat (or maybe my favorite dad hat) into the dating ring. I’m on the lookout for a wonderful female partner who can handle my blend of sarcasm, sweetness, and an unhealthy obsession with pizza. 

A little about me: I’m the kind of guy who thinks that “adulting” is just a fancy term for pretending to know what I’m doing. I have a full-time job, but I promise I won’t bore you with the details—unless you want to hear about how I almost set the office coffee machine on fire (long story). 

I enjoy long walks… to the fridge, deep conversations about whether pineapple belongs on pizza, and binge-watching shows while pretending I’ll be productive. I also have a dog who thinks he’s a cat, so if you’re a fan of furry companions who have mastered the art of ignoring you, we’ll get along just fine!

I’m looking for someone who can appreciate the finer things in life, like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee or the joy of finding an extra fry at the bottom of the bag. Bonus points if you have a witty sense of humor and can keep up with my dad jokes—trust me, they’re legendary. 

So if you’re a fun-loving, kind-hearted woman (30+ because let’s be honest, we’re all a little more interesting with some life experience), and you’re ready to embark on this hilarious adventure called dating, let’s chat! Who knows, we might just end up being the ultimate dynamic duo of sarcasm and sweetness.

Drop me a message if you’re interested, and let’s see where this goes—preferably somewhere with good coffee and maybe even some pizza! 🍕😊",0,1741019150.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

I've known her for a couple of years, haven't been in extensive touch with her (we know each other only because I head a student committee kinda thing at my college, & she was recruited as a team member 2 yrs back.) She looks pretty, but due to my seniority, she addresses me as 'bhai' and while I've absolutely no idea as to whether she's single or dating (she's a pretty good personality that I feel she might be dating someone from her batch), or how she looks at me; I just want to ask her out for a coffee atleast once (since I'm about to graduate within a month)

I don't want to sound creep or very desperate, I want to reply to her last text in a classic way that she gets the hint that I'm asking her out, without being too straightforward. I fucked up such a chance last time in another conversation, I don't wanna do that this time.

No.
No it doesn’t.

What they don’t tell you is that the fancy water you’re supposed to use doesn’t just highlight the sweeter notes of your coffee. It brings out the gross notes that the tap water you were using before did a great job hiding. 😂

This morning, eager to try my favorite coffee beans with my softer water, I discovered … Mold?! Dirt?! What is this nasty, earthy, just-stuck-my-face-in-a-hole-in-the-ground taste/aroma?! Nnnnoooooooo! My favorite coffee, ruined with good water! Whyyyyy!

I couldn’t help but laugh.
Coffee is hard. 

Does this mean the coffee is bad?! Is it actual mold (it doesn’t look “moldy”)? Or does it just mean that I need a different water to enjoy it? Because ew. 🥲

On the bright side, the expensive coffee I bought which I previously believed tasted of “nothing” now has strong floral notes that are enjoyable and balanced (an Ethiopian from a local roaster). Guess that was money well spent? Maybe?

1j2mfnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1j2mfnd/movie_type_of_love_6_years_later/,[Movie Type of Love] 6 Years Later,"Hi all, I am confessing my feelings to an ex from 6 years ago on Sunday. I have mixed feelings about it, but also know I need to do this… we’ll call this girl A for the sake of the post.

For background, I met A back in 2018 and we were friends for probably a month before officially started dating. What followed was what can only be described as “in the movies” type of love… the relationship was amazing. Sure, we were both young, but I think we both knew it was special and a serious thing between us. 

Fast forward four months in, she gets sick for like a month, has a loved one pass away, and gets overwhelmed with school and life. She ends things and explains that she has way too much going on to handle a serious relationship, and that when things get deep and emotional she tends to shut down. A couple weeks later we get into an argument and I say some things I am not proud of… she asked for space and we stopped talking for a few months. We end up picking things up again and are friends. About 9 months post breakup, i am not over the relationship, but I start dating someone else thinking maybe if i do that it will force my feelings away. We talk and decide it’s best we don’t keep in touch with our exes (especially with how I feel about mine). I tell A this, and initially she seems understanding. But the next day she sends a long text and at the end states “i’m happy you have a girlfriend now”. I immediately take this to mean she’s really not happy… but I don’t say it. I push back and let my pride take over. After a heated argument, we stop talking for months. We eventually pick up conversation again and I ask her to meet for coffee as I wanted to explain myself. She tells me in that meeting that she can’t go through that again and that if we are going to be friends I can’t do that to her again. I promise her this and we remain friends. Months later I tell her a little bit about how I feel and she responds “I’m not there yet” but I don’t really grasp what it means… for a few weeks I tell myself exactly that, “she’s not ready” and then over time I convince myself this is her trying to let me down easy. I start dating another girl, and A unblocks me from an app to see my posts about the new girl… that relationship ends and I just immediately jump into another. That one I go on three dates before cutting things off because I realize I’m still not over A. Eventually, I convince myself that A doesn’t want me and that it’s over and I need to move on. I jump fully into the relationship with the one I cut things off after the 3rd date. We’ll call her C. I end up with C for 3.5 years moving across the country but still talking to A once a month over text. 

Keeping in touch every month was a mix of keeping my promise not to cut things off, but also I didn’t want to talk more than that as I knew anything more was probably borderline emotional cheating… things got serious with C to the point of marriage being discussed… I always had the question in my head though “are you really going to marry C without ever telling A how you feel?” I would dream of A often, and eventually had a dream where she was at my wedding and confessed to me how she felt. This led me to message A and ask her how she felt about inviting one another to our weddings one day, to which she pretty quickly asked me if I was thinking of proposing to C. I told her I had thought about it but I didn’t know for sure… 

Fast forward to now… C and I have split up, I am living across country from A. I realized all this time I’ve been trying to replace A without ever directly telling her how I feel. At least not everything I wanted to… the one time I did was very minimal. I’ve realized I don’t want to be in a situation like I was with C again where I wonder if I’ll ever tell A how I feel. So here I am back in my hometown meeting with her on Sunday. I refuse to regret not telling her years from now, not knowing what could’ve been. She needs to know she’s the best thing to ever happen to me, and that I’m willing to move back to our hometown for the chance with her again. I need to know if what we had was this one of a kind thing that I feel it was, or if it was in my head and it was only that way to me. I feel like from little things like the reaction when I first started dating someone new to the reaction/conversation to my question about the weddings indicates she has some type of feeling somewhere about it… she hasn’t really dated that much as far as I know, and I know I’m not interested in anyone where I am now… I know what I want, and it’s her. 

Where I am struggling is I’m going back and forth with even saying anything. I’ve been telling myself for months now I need to say this, and I need to do this, and I even flew all the way out here. But I’m doubting it now. Because I know it’s a lot all at once and after 4 years of physically not even seeing each other (we saw each other once this past December) I need to know this to either work with her on it, or move on my own. I’m scared because I am worried about coming to the conclusion that she and I shouldn’t be friends because it’s preventing me from moving on, in which I’d be breaking my promise… some days I feel like I just need to go meet with her and be friends and keep things good and not bring up anything that would be stupid... But at the same time I think it’s everything… any advice is welcome because I am talking myself out of it and also need to try to make this a confession that expresses how I feel, but also does not come across as weird or creepy… I suppose if she doesn’t have feelings it might come across that way anyways considering the time that’s passed…

And the past couple of years she has become more and more listless and hopeless about life and I don't know what to do.

I understand her somewhat. My moon is in Sagittarius and it's just not like her at all. Normally she is the life and soul of the party. She loved to travel. She found opportunity in every problem life threw at her (*where there's a will there's a way!*) even though she was born in the cusp between Sag and Scorpio she has always identified as a Sag and by all means presented as one.

But recently...my goodness she has given up on living. She doesn't want to do anything or go anywhere unless it is with me or my brother. Don't get me wrong, we LOVE  being with her and invite her places often. However, she complains constantly that she has no reason for being here because she has no social life of her own. 

She doesn't want to get out of bed most days. She doesn't want to make new friends (despite having lots of invitations and opportunities to make them).

My theory kinda is that she has become a victim of her own success. She raised us single handedly. She faced many hardships doing so. She's worked 3 jobs at a time, even emigrated  country to escape our HCOL country, and moved back again after becoming financially comfortable.

She's got her own home now paid for, plenty of money in the bank for bills and saving for the first time in her life. However despite this, she is miserable! It may be she's been riding the high of jumping from one problem to the next? Now there's no problems to solve, perse.

We have tried signing her up for classes, she's been invited to the local gym sessions for older people, I've taken her to spiritual events to meet like-minded people, old friends have reached out to invite her for coffee or drinks but...nothing. She agrees at the time then cancels at the last minute then sits in misery again and thats all we hear about.

Admittedly her health had taken a downturn. Out of her control, but even the doctor said that getting out and about will alleviate her symptoms. However, she was like this prior to her health worsening anyway so 🤷‍♀️ I dunno my gut tells me it's all related.

So Sags please help us out, what motivates you when you are in a slump? Is there anything the people closest to you can do? She is being very stubborn, which is to be expected!",2,1741018529.0,Sagittarians,2,1.0,False
1j2maen,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j2maen/should_i_send_an_apology_text_for_dumping_my_ex/,Should I send an apology text for dumping my ex?,"So my ex(23M) and I(23F) have been in a relationship for a little over two months. We’ve had weekly arguments but have always come back stronger. Until this past weekend, his jealousy issues really started to show. I went to one of my best friend’s goodbye party as she would be moving soon as this is the last time I would see her. The plan was for us to pregame at her friends apartment and go to a club after. I let my ex know that the party was 70%men and 30% women as my friend does have a lot of guy friends but I have no control over that. Mind you I invited him but he works late so he can never come to me to events. He was uncomfortable with me going and especially with me going to the club with them. I did my best to reassure him that I was there to hang out with my find and have a good time, but that if he was uncomfortable with me going out with them I would respect that and not go to the club with them. I asked if he would pick me up from the pregame that would only be a few hours as I would be drinking either way. I thought that was reasonable because if I had gone to the club I would have time to sober up and drive home, but since I wasn’t going I would need a ride and I told him I’m uncomfortable taking uber alone especially as a young intoxicated girl in Atlanta. Mind you I have really bad social anxiety and was really nervous to go to my friends goodbye party as I only knew her there, so I wanted to drink to cool off and it does help me. 
He had not problem picking me up and we had this convo the morning of the party. Anyways I end up getting to the pregame really late, as it was a really stressful drive through Atl traffic and I was on the phone with my friend right I got into the apartment to see her. Immediately we start drinking and I’m having a good time, meeting her friends and just hanging out. An hour into me being there my ex text me “are you alive??” I said yes babe, sorry was just hanging out with my friends, we were giving goodbye speeches and drinking. He then says “no update no ride” and is refusing to answer my calls or texts. I had already not chosen to go to the club and my friend was a little disappointed I couldn’t go but people were ready to head out to the bars. So I texted my ex “are you coming, people are heading out soon.” He’s still ignoring me, but the text that hurt the most is when I told him “ok I guess I’ll just drive home drunk” and he says “ok have a bad night”
So I did make it home thank god, and I texted him the next day we need to meet up and talk. I was really hoping he would apologize but he just got super defensive and told me how he felt hurt that I didn’t text him for 5-6 hours and how weird that was, and how he felt I was only using him for a ride. Then I apologized for not texting him but I explained the situation and it got even worse. He was not understanding me at all, putting all the blame on me, and then called me a fucking child for not calling myself and uber and that I don’t know how to be in a relationship if I think it’s ok to not update someone if I’m expecting a ride from them. I was so hurt, he was getting really angry and not understanding what he did was much worse, as I told him I don’t care how mad I am at you, if I said I’m going to give you a ride then I will because you’re life is in my hands. He just said “ok”, nothing else so I told him I can’t be in a relationship with someone like this and we finished our coffee and walked out. I was going to give him a hug, after I said “well bye I guess”. But he walked straight to his car and didn’t even look at me. 
Anyways, it is the next day and I’m really debating on sending him this text, “hey, I really don't like to end things on bad terms. I was hoping we could work things out if you had taken accountability for leaving me stranded, which I found really hurtful. Regardless, I want to say that I appreciate the time we spent together. You're a great guy, and I wish you the best in life.” 
I have been advised not to and to just leave it be, but as crazy as it sounds I do know he really loved me. And the worst part is, although I told him I don’t think texting 24/7 is a big deal, he made it clear that it was to him, which is why I felt really bad that I hurt him by not doing that. I personally feel it’s better to do things sooner than later, and I don’t want to get back together I just want to try one last time to get him to understand that his behavior is not okay, because I know he was really hurt after the breakup and I really did not expect things to end so badly. 
What should I do? I’m pretty certain that I want to send the text, but would that be a stupid thing to do? Please help
