With​ a plethora of brands and styles⁣ available, selecting the perfect mason mug jar can be​ a daunting task.

## Key ‍Features Analysis

The modern mason mug jar boasts a⁢ range of features designed to enhance its ‍versatility and usability. From​ durable ‌construction to innovative lid designs, these features contribute to the overall appeal and functionality of ⁤these charming ⁤containers.

**Material and Construction:**

The vast majority of mason mug jars are constructed from durable soda-lime glass. This‍ material ​is prized for⁣ its inert nature,‍ meaning it won't react with the contents‌ stored inside, preserving the flavor and integrity of beverages and other items. Many higher-end ⁤jars are crafted from thicker glass, providing increased resistance to breakage and temperature shock. Look for ‍jars that are ⁤dishwasher safe for ‌easy cleaning and ⁢maintenance.

**Lid Options‍ and Sealing:**

A critical feature‍ is the lid design, as‌ it directly impacts the jar's ability to seal and prevent leaks. Traditional two-piece lids, consisting of a flat lid‌ and a⁢ metal ring, offer excellent sealing ⁤capabilities for canning and long-term storage. Newer designs often incorporate silicone‍ gaskets or hinged lids for added convenience and spill-proof performance, making them ideal for everyday use as beverage containers.‌ The⁣ material ⁣used in the lid also plays a role, with stainless steel being a popular choice for its durability and ⁢resistance to corrosion.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics:**

many mason mug jars feature a handle, greatly enhancing ⁤their ‍usability as drinking⁣ vessels. Handle​ designs vary widely, from​ simple⁤ looped glass handles ⁣to more elaborate ergonomic designs that provide a⁢ pleasant and secure grip. Consider the size⁤ and shape of the handle to ensure it fits comfortably in⁣ yoru hand. Some ‍jars also offer handle-less ‌designs, wich are more ​versatile for storage and association but less practical⁤ for enjoying hot beverages.

**Dimensions and Capacity:**

Mason mug⁤ jars are ‌available in a ⁣wide range of sizes,from ⁤small 8-ounce jars suitable for individual ⁣servings to larger 32-ounce jars ‌perfect for⁢ holding iced⁢ coffee ‌or smoothies.Consider your intended use when selecting‍ the capacity. Larger jars offer greater volume but can be cumbersome to carry, while smaller jars are‍ more portable but may require frequent‌ refills. The overall‌ dimensions of⁢ the jar⁣ also impact its suitability for ⁤different environments, such as ⁤home, office, or outdoor use.

**Aesthetics and Design choices:**

Beyond functionality, the‍ aesthetic appeal of mason⁢ mug jars is a‍ significant ​factor for​ many buyers. Jars come in a variety of colors,from clear to ⁢vintage-inspired shades of ⁢blue and green. Embossed ‌designs, textured surfaces,‌ and decorative patterns add a touch ‍of⁤ personality and visual interest. Consider how the jar's design complements your existing kitchenware or home decor.

1l88zm1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l88zm1,"Complete Japan Knife Shopping Guide from my 2025 trip (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai, Fukuyama)","Hello TCK!

I am back to wrap up my trip to Japan and all the knife adventures I had. 

I came home with a haul of (pic 7 & 8) [six new Japanese knives and a massive Aizu](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1k5ratg/haul_from_our_japan_trip_and_a_preview_of_posts/) for my first Japanese natural stone. Overall, including gifts and knives our family bought for themselves, we bought something like 14 knives.

With all that shopping experience, I wanted to make this guide for those planning their own trip. I am going to try to be as comprehensive and chronological as possible. My hope is this post is more informative than anything. That being said, I wrote a ton in the linked posts so I will try to be brief in my descriptions here. For more info, click the links!

***\*While this is meant to be a guide, it is not meant to replace the*** [***TrueChefKnives Wiki***](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/wiki/index/) ***which has a*** [***Tokyo Knife Shops Guide***](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/wiki/index/tokyoknifeshops/)***. Make sure to check that out as well. I also linked all contact forms in case you would like to visit these makers. Please reach out well in advance of your trip; ideally at least one month ahead of time.\****

Some extra context: my partner and I are working toward moving to Japan and this was a trip to ensure that our two most important people -- her mom and my grandmother -- can make the trip. So while we did a lot of knife shopping, the trip was not knife-focused. There were definitely stops we missed along the way.

This guide will cover my knife shopping in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai and Fukuyama (Shibata) in that order. If you are looking at one specific area, that should help you jump around more quickly. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tokyo - Kappabashi Street & Morihei for Japanese natural stones

I was in Tokyo for the start and end of my trip, but I still missed some staples like Teruyasa Fujiwara and Hitohira.

My shopping included about six hours rummaging through everything on Kappabashi Street and making the 30 minute walk over to Morihei to look at Japanese natural stones. Kappabashi was fun, but hanging out with Ogura-san at Morihei and looking at a seemingly unlimited number of natural stones blew me away.

**Kappabashi Street - Mostly overpriced stamped knives, but some gems + Kama-Asa was wonderful**

Kappabashi Street was rough from a knife POV. It had mostly stamped VG10 knives rebranded for whatever retailer was selling them and everything was priced very high, but if you're willing to wade through the expensive mediocre knives, there are some gems to find.

Tsubaya is well-regarded around here, but there were pretty picked over when I visited as was Seisuke. The prices were pretty damn high here as well. Jikko followed that same trend as did Kamata. I was pretty underwhelmed overall. I'd give Kappabashi a 4/10 for knives with one exception: Kama-Asa.

Kama-Asa had much better prices. Plus, their in-house knives are forged by the legendary Tanaka-san and sharpened by Wakae-san of Baba Hamono. The factory-made knives were less egregiously priced and there was quite a selection. I ended up grabbing the (pic 9) in-house Gyuto 210 in W2 (Tanaka x Wakae) for a very good friend and my only regret is not buying one for myself. Look at that cladding line!

Kama-Asa gets an 8/10 with a slight knock because the upper tier knives are fewer in numbers and it's so busy. It is still the best store on Kappabashi IMO and there are employees with strong English too.

Extra shoutout for basic kitchen shopping on Kappabashi. Knives might be rough, but the kitchen gear was great and extremely affordable. 10/10 for kitchen gear shopping with a decent amount of English spoken at most stores.

[*Kappabashi Shopping Experience + Kama-Asa W2 Gyuto 210 (Tanaka x Wakae)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1kcg1jo/japan_shopping_experience_kappabashi_kitchen/)

*No need to contact ahead of time.*

**Morihei - Japanese natural stone store of my dreams + Ogura-san sharpening lesson & him being the best**

I said so much in my shopping experience linked below so read that, but I cannot say enough about how wonderful my experience was buying my first Japanese natural stone at Morihei. I expected the shopping to be tough because of the steep learning curve and just how vague everything is. But everyone at Morihei, including Ogura-san himself, were so helpful and guided me to this massive Aizu (pic 7) which is now my favorite stone.

I even got to test the stone out on a knife they had in the shop and (pic 1) got a lesson from Ogura-san himself. What a dream. If you are even slightly interested in a Japanese natural stone, this is a must-visit. The younger guy who helped me also spoke pretty good English, although Ogura-san does not so get that translator app ready if you do not speak Japanese. 

10/10 experience with no notes.

# Kyoto - Jikko & Yoshida Hamono on Nishiki Market

Kyoto was a brief knife shopping section of my trip, but I came away with such different experiences at each of Jikko and Yoshida Hamono that it felt worth mentioning. Both of these stores were side by side on the shopping mall side of Nishiki Market. Unfortunately, I have no pictures, did not buy anything and have no previous posts to share other than these quick thoughts.

I was really bummed about my experience at Jikko. The whole sales staff seemed disinterested in talking with me even with some elementary level Japanese to bridge the gap. I also feel like no one was either educated about what they were selling or were outright refusing to provide me with any information beyond the steel type, shape and size. It wasn't a horrible experience and I am not trying to keep people from shopping Jikko, but it was a much different experience than buying from almost every other retailer. I felt like I was shopping in a Louis Vuitton; not a knife shop. 

4/10 overall score from me. A little bit of English was spoken, but not much. Translator app will be helpful.

Inversely, Yoshida Hamono was cramped, packed and had knives everywhere, but the staff was so warm and accommodating. They had Saji knives, some Nigara Hamono options, their own in-house stuff and a bunch of other knives too. It is down a fairly steep set of stairs and is a bit more discreet than Jikko next door, but I enjoyed shopping there much more. It is worth popping in if you're already at Nishiki Market, which it seems most tourists love to visit. Prices were not half bad either! 

7/10 score for me. They even spoke pretty damn good English!

*No need to contact either ahead of time.*

After this there were a few days with no knife shopping in Nara or Kinosaki Onsen so we are now skipping ahead to where things really get going: Osaka and Sakai.

# Osaka - Sakai Ichimonji & a few other shops on the same kitchen street

*This section is specifically about Osaka City; not Sakai. If you are looking for Sakai, it is the next section below this.*

I fucking love Osaka. It is by far my favorite city in Japan. That being said, I did not do much knife shopping directly in Osaka City.

Still, I wanted to shoutout Sakai Ichimonji which is  fairly well known on this sub considering one of us actually works over there. Everyone seemed super accommodating, the store was huge, the knives were great and the prices were not bad at all. Frankly, it was one of the better knife stores I went to outside of Sakai. 

I did not buy anything with a day trip in Sakai around the corner and I failed to take any pictures, but I had fun window shopping. Plus, the area around Sakai Ichimonji is actually a kitchen street in Osaka. It is just a quick 10 minute walk from Dotonbori and near Namba Station. That whole area is worth checking out. I had an awesome time.

8/10 experience, but only because I was window shopping and not actually in the market to buy. But the store and its offerings was a 9/10. It is without a doubt worth visiting.

*How to contact Sakai Ichimonji:* [*https://global.ichimonji.co.jp/pages/contact*](https://global.ichimonji.co.jp/pages/contact)

# Sakai - Takada no Hamono, Konosuke, Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum, Baba Hamono, Sakai Kikumori & Sakai Takayuki...what a day!

At this point in the trip, nearly two weeks had passed and I had somehow bought a grand total of zero knives for myself, but it was time for grail hunting in Sakai and I went wild.

I did miss a few spots such as Ashi Hamono and Hado, but it was such an incredible day and by the end of it, I had four new knives to take home with me including two grails. The only goal I failed at achieving was getting a Takada no Hamono, but that means I have something to strive for on my next trip lol

These descriptions are going to be even shorter since I wrote so much about each of them individually. Click the links to learn more!

**Takada no Hamono - no knife, but the best experience meeting Takada-san**

I wrote so much about meeting Takada-san (pic 2) in the post below that I will just let that post speak for itself. Takada-san is the kindest and warmest person I met on my trip and I cannot wait to go back and visit him again. Hopefully next time I can pick up a knife of my own by him.

9/10 overall only because I did not get a knife. Every other aspect was incredible. Takada-san speaks decent English, but be ready with a translator app if you do not know any Japanese.

[*Takada no Hamono Shopping Experience*](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1l6jiy3/japan_shopping_experience_takada_no_hamono/)

*How to contact: @ takadanohamono on Instagram*

**Konosuke - grandma found her new petty in the beautiful Konosuke showroom, but no grails**

I really wish I spent more time shopping at Konosuke getting to know the staff. As my appreciation for Japanese knives has grown, so has my adoration of Konosuke. Next time, I hope I can find a grail or two over there. They did not have anything other than GS+, Sumiiro, and a couple HD2 knives so I did not get anything, but my grandma got a GS+ Nashiji Petty 150 (pic 10) while we were there and she loves it.

7/10 overall, but I would bet that was my own inexperience and gaps in knowledge than any issue with Konosuke. It seemed like less English was spoken here so again, be ready with a translator app if you need it.

*How to contact: email* [*info@konosuke-sakai.com*](mailto:info@konosuke-sakai.com)

**Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum - couple Hado Shiosai purchased, an awesome selection of knives and even better buying experience**

For someone new to this hobby who wants a great knife in Japan and is headed to Osaka, the Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum is my first recommendation. There were over a dozen brands available with options from entry level knives to Hado B1D sujihiki to grail honyaki, and the prices were more than fair. There are plenty of different steels and a fair amount of stainless options too. For a one-stop shop in Sakai, it does not get much better. Hell, there is a giant deba on the outside of the building (pic 3) so it's even easy to find.

My grandma grabbed a Hado Shiosai SG2 Ko-Bunka 135 (pic 12) while my mother in law grabbed a Hado Shiosai SG2 Kiritsuke 210 (pic 11) so they can match. I also grabbed a Yamatsuka Ginsan Yanagiba 240 for a friend which I failed to get a picture of before passing it along.

10/10 no notes. Perfect place for family, gifts, those newer to the hobby, and those with years of experience with Japanese knives. The staff speaks really good English as well for a cherry on top.

**Baba Hamono - buying a couple grails, meeting a couple legends & another incredible experience**

I have made the most posts in total about Baba Hamono so there is probably very little I have not said. Either way, it was much better than I expected. 

Everyone was so kind, there was a great selection of even their rarer knives and the chance to see the workshop (pic 4). I also got to meet Nishida-san (striped shirt), Wakae-san (black jacket) and everyone else which was such a treat. 

Prices were what you expect for knives of this caliber and everything was spectacular. I grabbed a two Kagekiyo grails (pic 13): a Grey Dyed B1D Gyuto 240 (Nakagawa x Nishida) and a Ginsan Gyuto 210 (Nakagawa x Myojin). My mother in law also grabbed a Kagekiyo Gokujyo W2 Petty 135 (pic 14).

10/10 experience with no notes. Shu-san speaks pretty good English too!

**Kawamura Hamono - home of Sakai Kikumori & where my partner bought her new petty** 

Shopping here is more like standing in the entry while a man pulls out boxes from shelves near the stairs and displays them on a foldout table so do not expect the Ritz Carlton!

That being said, the man who helped us was incredibly kind and showed us quite a few knives. No Choyo or Yugiri were available, but my partner fell in love with the Sakai Kikumori Kikuzuki W2 Petty 135mm (Tanaka x Morihiro Hamono) so we grabbed it. It's an epic little knife and it was a cool little workshop. I am happy we made time between Baba Hamono and Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery to stop on the way at Kawamura Hamono.

6/10 only because it felt like we intruded with the workshop being so small with no sales floor and the stock being low. The man who helped us was very kind and did the best he could with very little English. Thankfully my partner and I speak very basic Japanese and were able to ask for certain things, but this is another workshop to have the translator app ready. Make sure you know the different lines of knives offered by Sakai Kikumori before coming too; they are extremely secretive which can make buying tough. This is definitely a more niche pick and it would be the first I would recommend skipping for someone new to the hobby.

**Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery - finally getting my lefty deba & the beautiful, but expensive knife gallery**

Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery was a mixed bag.

On one hand, the space was beautiful (pic 5), the staff spoke great English, there were so many incredible knives including Michiko-san engraved stuff and knives forged by Itsuo Doi-san, and even the coffee was good. 

On the other hand, prices were higher here than anywhere in Sakai and higher than what I would pay back home at Carbon Knife Co. in Denver. It was a weird tradeoff. I know they invested in the space and made it beautiful, I also know they are all about keeping the craft of Sakai knife making moving forward. But those prices hurt; especially after paying for tickets to visit in the first place.

I ended up with (pic 16) a Sakai Takayuki Tokujyo W2 Lefty Deba 135 (Kenji Togashi x Kenya Togashi) which was smaller than I originally intended, but it's not like I am tearing down huge fish in my 600sqft apartment lol.

I'll give it a 6/10 despite all it has going for it. Those prices hurt! This is another option I would advise people newer to this hobby to not prioritize, but visit if you have the time.

# Fukuyama, Hiroshima - my wild ride to meet Shibata

First off, if you are wanting to visit Shibata-san, please read my post linked below on my shopping experience so you can avoid the (many) mistakes I made.

That being said, for those prepared, the trip to visit Shibata-san was a blast and the legend himself was a joy to hang out with for a bit.

**Shibata Knife Gallery - two Tinker knives and an epic experience with Shibata-san**

Shibata-san might be out of the way, but I am so happy I made the adventure to go see him (pic 6). Not only was he an awesome guy, but so was Rie-san who helped me plan my trip from the very beginning.

The trip was equally miraculous and a disaster, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I even have two (TWO!!) Tinker knives in my collection (pic 17): Tinker Saber Tooth 210 and the Tinker Tank 180. Shibata-san even customized the engraving on the Saber Tooth to commemorate my late-father and then gave me a ride in his Porsche back to the train station. What a fucking day lol.

Even with all the chaos, it is an easy 10/10. Go visit Shibata-san if you're willing to be a bit adventurous and want an unbelievable knife. Rie-san also speaks amazing English and Shibata-san is no slouch himself.

1l88ypn,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1l88ypn/realizing_that_nothing_has_really_changed_after_a/,Realizing that nothing has really changed after a few years.,"I started struggling with depression around the age of 12 or 13 (I was diagnosed), and I’m 24 now (I’m a woman). There have been severe periods of depression (including a suicide attempt), and other times in my life when I was truly happy.

To explain a bit, I had a group of friends in middle school with whom I shared a lot. They all ended up going to the same high school, and I went to a different one—so basically, they all turned their backs on me, and other things happened around that time too. That whole experience really traumatized me.

I managed to make some friends in high school, but nothing significant. I met my first boyfriend, and we stayed together for almost three years. It ended amicably. A year later, I had another boyfriend, but that was a horrible relationship, and it lasted about eight months.

So, several years passed—this was just after COVID. I was still depressed and without friends. Then single again, though that wasn’t really the issue. I think it was mostly the lack of friends that weighed on me.

On top of that, I did a BTS (a French diploma program), but I didn’t pass. So I decided to leave for Canada. I stayed there for almost three years and returned to my country last year. I met 2–3 people over there that I used to hang out with from time to time—to go shopping or grab a coffee. That helped me a lot.

But when I came back home, the distance made us drift apart. And I won’t lie, it’s really hard for me to maintain friendships. I’ve been so used to being alone for nearly half my life that when I have the chance to make a friend, I don’t feel like I deserve it. And in the end, I always feel like people will leave me eventually.

So here I am, back in my country. I’m going to turn 25 this year. I’m not doing anything. I’m looking for a job, but I haven’t done anything for a year because I’ve been too depressed… I have no friends. I get along well with my parents, but they don’t understand me. My sister is awful to me—she’s 28 and doesn’t live with our parents anymore, but I get no support from her.

Now you might say: go out, do something, find a passion or a hobby. But nothing motivates or interests me. And people who suffer from depression will understand that.

Or you’ll say: being alone is fine—you can enjoy your own company. And sure, I know that. I’ve traveled to the U.S., Canada, and Scotland all by myself. But still, I mostly feel like I’m just trying to run away from something every time I travel. And at the same time, being alone and far away actually feels good.

But I always end up back at square one. I keep a journal, and when I read what I wrote 2–3 years ago—or even last year—it’s exactly how I feel today. I feel alone, like I have no one.

Why does this happen to me? I don’t think I’m a bad person. I’ve tried to accept that I probably had flaws in my past relationships—both romantic and platonic. I’m not saying nothing was my fault. But still… why does it have to be this extreme?

I have absolutely no one to talk to. Nothing to do. Just work—and sometimes travel. But for what purpose?

It makes me incredibly sad to read my journal and see that the “me” from a year ago or three years ago is still the same. And also the same as I was 10 years ago when I attempted suicide.

Oh—and yes, I’ve seen psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors, energy healers. Nothing works. So maybe the problem is just me. Or maybe it’s my life. And there’s nothing I can do about it.",2,1749586181.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

That's not all; when that image appeared on TheWackyWatch.com, Glitch mentioned a ""9th circle of hell."" That 9 could be a reference to the episode number. Also, we should remember that Goose said from the beginning that episode 5 is about softball, so the only real screenshot from the next episode is the one from the stadium.

Last year, my wife passed away from breast cancer. We had been married for 12 years. She was 35. She fought hard, stayed positive, and somehow kept smiling through every horrible round of chemo and every sleepless night. After she passed, I couldn’t bring myself to touch her things. Her clothes stayed in the closet. Her books stayed on the nightstand. Her favorite coffee mug, chipped and stained, sat untouched on the shelf.

Everyone told me that holding onto her stuff wasn’t healthy, and eventually I started to believe it. So I started sorting. One box at a time. I cried through every sweater, every scarf, every damn pair of socks she owned. Some things I kept. Others I donated.

And then, about a week ago, I realized I had made a huge mistake. Somehow, I had put her favorite sweater—this oversized, mustard yellow knit thing she wore all the time—in one of the donation bags. She used to wear it around the house when she was cold, or when she felt sick. It still smelled like her. It was the one thing I swore I’d never part with.

I drove to the thrift store the second I realized. It had already been picked over. The worker said they couldn’t track individual items, and that it might have already been sold. I checked every rack, even asked strangers if they’d seen it. Nothing.

It’s just a sweater. But it feels like I lost her all over again. And it’s killing me.

I just needed to tell someone.

1l88riz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l88riz/my_brother_was_investigating_a_cult_now_hes/,My brother was investigating a cult now he’s missing,"We moved to Rosewood Estate three weeks ago.

You ever seen those neighborhoods that look like someone just copy-pasted the same house thirty times? That’s Rosewood. Cookie-cutter homes, identical mailboxes, perfect lawns. Everyone waves. Everyone smiles.

It was my brother’s idea.
“It’s quiet. Safe. Good schools,” he said.

Which is funny, because neither of us has kids.

He moved in two months before me. Got a place on the next street over. A week later, he called me and said, “You gotta come out here, man. Everyone’s so nice.”

He was right.
Too right.

The first week, everything felt… fine. Boring, even. Martha from across the street brought banana bread. Old guy with Coke-bottle glasses gave me his lawnmower “just to borrow.”
I didn’t go to the welcome party.

Then my brother stopped answering his phone.

At first I thought he was just being a flake — he does that. But after three days, I walked to his place.

Porch light on. Car in the driveway. Curtains shut.
No answer.

I knocked. Banged.
Nothing.

A few neighbors stood in their lawns across the street, completely still. Not staring at me — just… out. Like mannequins.

I left. Filed a missing person report.
The police shrugged. “He’s an adult.”

So I broke into his house.

It wasn’t trashed. No sign of a struggle. TV remote on the couch. Coffee cup on the counter — half full. His phone on the charger.

On the table: a yellow legal pad. Notes. Dozens of names, some circled. A line at the top:

“They all go to the meetings.”

And at the bottom — a number. No name.

I texted it. Called it. No answer.

Until that night:
One reply.
🕷️
And one word: Careful.

Edit: Someone’s been in my house.
Door was unlocked.
Note on my pillow:

“Let him go. He’s at peace now. You will be too, soon.”

I kept texting the number. Eventually, I got a reply.

His name was James.
He told me my brother had been researching something. A cult. Something in the neighborhood.
He said my brother had found proof. Followed them. Filmed something he shouldn’t have.

James sent me a scanned newspaper clipping:

“Local Cult Investigated After Six Disappearances — No Charges Filed.”

Guess who was in the photo?
Martha.
Smiling.

I went back to my brother’s place.
The door was open.

Lights on. Shower running.

I left. Fast.

James texted me that night:

“If he comes back… don’t believe it’s him.”

Edit:
He came back.
He knocked on my door at 10:42 PM.
Smiling. Hair wet. Holding a six-pack.

“Hey man, sorry I’ve been out of touch. Just needed time.”

He smiled. Asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow. Said he had a recipe he wanted to try.

My brother’s never cooked a day in his life.

Edit: James is gone. His messages stopped.

Someone left a container on my porch.

White powder. No label.
A note in red marker:

“For the recipe.”

Edit:
They invited me to the Sunday Social.
My brother said, “There’s a special dish being prepared. You’ll love it.”

Edit:
They tied me up.

There were other newcomers — a dozen of us. All in white.
They said it was tradition. My brother told me, “It’s more meaningful if you sit with the first-timers.”

I believed him.

He said, “We need evidence. Play along. Eat just enough to blend in.”

So I sat down.

Then they tied us all up.

He looked at me. Smiled.
Kneeled down next to my chair.

“We needed you to stop fighting.”
“You were the last one.”
“I’m sorry. But it’s so much better after.”

They brought the trays.

One by one, they lifted the lids. The food wasn’t food.

It moved. It pulsed.

They fed it to the woman at the end.

She screamed.

Then stopped.

Then smiled.

The next man fought harder. They held him down.

Spoon in.

Silence.

Smile.

They got to me.

My brother took the spoon himself.

“You made it this far,” he said. “You’re stronger than most.”

He brought the spoon to my mouth.

I bit his hand.

He didn’t flinch.
Just smiled.

“Still fighting. That’s what makes you beautiful.”

I knocked over a lantern. The flames caught fast.

The black thing on my tray screeched.
One of them launched off the table, into someone’s neck.

I ran.

I don’t remember how I made it out.

I just remember the fire.

And my brother standing in the middle of it, untouched.

Smiling.

I’ve been hiding in a shed at the edge of the estate.

There’s a gate. Black iron. Hidden behind hedges.

I think it’s the way out. I haven’t tried it yet.

I don’t trust anything here.

I haven’t eaten. I’m drinking rainwater. It tastes like rust, but at least it doesn’t move.

I’m still trying to find a way out.
To warn people.
To do something.

I’ve lost them for now — I don’t know how long that’ll last. But I’ll keep going as long as I can.

Please, if you’re reading this, spread the word.

Don’t eat anything unless you’re absolutely sure where it came from.
Filter your water.
Don’t trust friendly neighbors if their smiles feel too perfect.
And if something feels off — it is.

I’ll try to keep updating, but my battery’s almost dead.
I’m not charging it here.
I don’t want to risk what’s waiting for me back home.

Please share this. Tell someone. Tell everyone.

Don’t let them spread.

1l88nko,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l88nko/mf_elote_de_muerte_corn_of_death/,[MF] Elote De Muerte (“Corn of Death”),"

Teodore Vargas followed the same routine every morning. He brewed coffee for himself and his wife, the rich aroma filling their small kitchen. Sitting in his simple green chair, he stirred the dark liquid slowly, savoring the warmth before taking the first sip.

Just then, he shuffled across the room, his old bones creaking, to turn on the radio. The news came on at exactly the same time every day. The weatherman’s voice crackled softly through the speakers.

“It will be sunny and warm today, with a slight chance of rain in the late afternoon—twenty percent. This evening will be warm and breezy…”

Teodore switched off the radio mid-sentence, a faint smile crossing his lips as he glanced at his wife. The morning sun spilled golden light through the window, warming the wooden floor beneath his feet.

Outside, he stepped into the garden, the scent of earth and growing corn thick in the air. He reached down, hand brushing against the rough green leaves before pulling up two dozen ears of fresh corn and piling them carefully into his wicker basket.

He opened the garage and loaded the harvest into his old rusted cart. Keys jingling, he fumbled briefly before finding the right one, unlocking his spice locker. Inside lay the treasured jars and packets — chili powder, lime salt, smoky paprika — the flavors that would transform the humble corn into *Elote*, the favorite treat of the tourists visiting Puerto Vallarta.

His sign, half-faded with age and painted in fancy green lettering, still hung proudly on the front of the cart. Though time had worn it down, one word remained perfectly clear: **“ELOTE.”**

He took a deep breath through his nose — the fresh scent of corn mingled with the salt of the ocean breeze rolling in from the coast. He exhaled slowly.

“Love you, honey,” he said with a smile that filled his heart and reached his eyes.

With that, he pushed the cart out of the garage, pulled the door shut behind him, and began the walk toward the touristy parts of Puerto Vallarta. Twenty-four pieces of Elote to sell — and he’d sell everyone. That was a fact.

The bells on his cart jingled in unison, ringing through the crisp, already-warmed mid-morning air. They chimed in rhythm with the beat of his steps, steady as ever. The cart creaked. The wheels groaned. His face, weather-beaten and tan from years under the sun, bore the quiet pride of a man who knew his place in the world.

His white tank top and faded blue jeans had seen better days, but they suited him just fine. He had no need for a fancy watch or a sharp suit — just his wife, their small one-bedroom home, and his Elote.

He had to walk push his propane powered cart exactly 7 blocks north and two blocks south to get to the prime spots, to sell his Elote. The place had changed drastically since he was younger. Hotels replaced beach front properties. Resorts we’re all the rage now. They attracted commerce from all over the world. Everybody wanted a place to relax for cheap in luxury.

When he was a young man he worked odd jobs. Once he was responsible for overseeing the construction of many of the resorts and hotels that sprang up over the years in Puerto Vallarta. Before that he tended fields with his neighbors and would ride his donkey out to the major cities in Mexico.

Before that well… that was complicated.

The weather was warm. The breeze wasn’t exactly refreshing, but it kept your mind off the heat. The salted sea air brushed against his face, cool and sharp. Teodore reached his spot, grabbed the handle to lock the wheels in place, removed the grill cover and tucked it beneath the cart inside a compartment. He turned on the gas, struck a match, and fired up the grill. It took exactly three minutes and forty-five seconds to heat before he could start enticing tourists with his fresh Elote.

He spotted a busy mother, loudly talking on her cell phone while trying to wrangle four kids—like a sheepdog herding restless lambs—heading toward the beach.

“Elote,” he called softly, his bells chiming in rhythm with the distant crashing waves.

The mother looked up from her conversation and met his gaze, a half-cocked, half-stressed smile crossing her face.

“Elote, señora?”

Her kids gathered around the frail old man and his cart, mesmerized by the green unshucked corn in the basket. The oldest girl whined, “Moooom,” with that perfect teenager tone begging for something.

“I’ll call you back, Fred. Lock down the proposal—I’ll look at it later tonight, okay?” The mother pressed the red glowing hang-up button and shoved the phone into her purse. She glanced at her child. “Yes?”

“Mom, I read about Mexican street food—Elote—in history class this year. It looks so good! Can we *please* have some?”

The mother let out a tired sigh, her shoulders sagging for a moment.

“How much?”

Teodore, with his green-hazel eyes, looked into the woman’s eyes and held out a hand, indicating five. She fished into her wallet, pulled out twenty-five American dollars, and handed it to him.

Though his hands were old and frail, muscle memory took over. He shucked, discarded, cooked, seasoned, and spread cheese on five pieces of Elote before the family even realized what had happened. They were soon walking away happy, munching on their corn, headed for the beach.

Just as they reached the crosswalk, the mother’s phone rang again. Teodore caught bits of her voice from a distance.

“FRED, I TOLD YOU…” Her tone stopped abruptly. “They *accepted* the offer? That’s great! Now I can relax—you stressed me out for no reason!”

They crossed the street, rounding the corner to the beach, all smiles.

“Balance,” Teodore murmured to himself. “A good deed for a good soul.”

The air shifted a bit as a sunburnt, self-absorbed tourist blasting music in his raised Jeep came screaming around the corner. He spotted Teodore and was drawn to him. Shirtless, wearing board shorts, he had a bit of a beer gut, and the “lady of the day” sat in the passenger seat. Half-drunk, she chimed up, slurring her speech, the day’s alcohol clear in her voice. “COLT!” she called out, “I want Elote!” The over-exaggerated, drawn-out *E* at the end lingered in the air.

Colt stepped out of his Jeep, looked Teodore in the eye, and in a douchey voice said, “Look, hombre.” The California accent flowed just like the frosted tips he still clung to. “How much?”  
Teodore, with those blue-green eyes, looked into the man’s soul and held up five fingers. Colt grunted and protested, “From seasoned corn!?”  
Teodore said simply, “Yes.”

Colt, music still blasting from his Jeep, reached into his board shorts, pulled out eight crumpled American dollars, threw the wad at Teodore, and stated, “Here you go, old man. I don’t have time for this — take it. It’s more money than you peasants will see in a lifetime.”

Teodore, without missing a beat and just as fast as before, shucked, discarded, cooked, seasoned, and topped the Elote with cheese before the man and his lady even realized what had happened.  
Colt, walking back toward his Jeep, tripped — breaking his $300 glasses and ruining his $200 Gucci visor. The lady of the day laughed as he angrily got into his car and drove off.

Teodore snickered to himself, “Balance. A bad deed for a misguided soul.”

The rest of the day passed without incident.  
Just happy tourists buying elote from Teodore, their laughter rising and falling like the waves behind them. The sun sank lower. Then the clouds rolled in.

That’s when he saw him. The man, the one whose soul would balance the scales.  
The final elote. The one who would move on.

 The man pulled out a golden pocket watch—half drunk, high, and glowing with the kind of happiness that only came from sunburnt beaches, too much tequila, and a day spent laughing with friends.

He tucked the watch back into his pocket, eyes catching on the elote sign.

“How much, señor?” he slurred—not disrespectful, just soft around the edges with intoxication.

Teodore spoke in perfectly rounded English.

“For you, free of charge.”

His voice no longer carried the rasp of an old peasant, but instead rang out clear, young, and full of purpose.  
The drunken man didn’t notice the change. He just grinned, took the elote, and stumbled off after his friends, crossing the street without a second thought.

The man turned to look back at Teodore.

But the old vendor was gone.

In his place stood a young Aztec warrior—bare-chested, painted in deep reds and obsidian blacks, no older than thirty. His eyes glowed not with menace, but with purpose.

Confused, the man blinked and stumbled a few steps back—only to find the cart was gone, the street was gone, even the sounds of the city were gone.

There was only wind now.  
It blew hollow, like breath across the mouth of a bottle.  
A distant foghorn echoed once, low and drawn out.

Behind him stretched a dock—endless, narrow, and slick with sea mist. It stretched into the horizon, disappearing into gray.

“Where... am I?” the man asked.

His voice echoed back to him, warped and slow, like it was caught underwater.

Teodore answered calmly.

**“The Netherworld. The place between sleep and awake.**  
**You died, and your soul was the one needed to balance the scales.”**

Behind him, the cart shimmered and shifted into ancient brass. Large iron **scales** swayed gently, then slowly settled—perfectly even.

The man began to cry, reaching for his pocket watch—but the weight of it wasn’t there.

Teodore continued.

**“I am an agent of death. I’ve worn many faces for six hundred years.**  
**My wife and I, both.**  
**I’ve taken the souls of the young, the old, the drunk, the spirited, the wealthy, the healthy, and the sick.”**

Through his sobs, the man pleaded.

**“I’m not dead! Please… send me back. I’m still young. Please!”**

He gasped for breath—and froze.  
No pain.  
No panic.  
Not even sorrow.  
Only stillness.  
Only calm.

Teodore’s voice returned, steady.

**“The task was given to me by the agent before me—a Spanish gentleman whose daughter was to be sacrificed to the gods. We spared her.”**

The man, strangely at peace now, wiped his face and whispered:

**“How did I die?”**

Teodore looked down at the gold watch in the man’s hand.

**“You drowned,”** he said. **“Three minutes ago.”**

The man stared at the watch.  
**“My dad’s watch,”** he said quietly.

Teodore gave a faint smile.

**“There is no watch.**  
**I am only a figment of your death experience.**  
**I do not judge.**  
**I do not decide.**  
**I simply move souls forward.”**

He pointed down the dock, into the fog.

**“Your next life is that way.”**

The man opened his mouth to speak—but no words came out. His body felt lighter now, translucent, like mist.

Teodore nodded.

**“You don’t have to understand.**  
**Just go.”**

And the man did.

He walked down the endless dock. In a few steps, he was swallowed by fog—gone.

What felt like hours in the space between death and life—between sleeping and waking—was only seconds in the real world.

Teodore stood once again on the side of the road. An old man. His cart empty.  
The day done.

The scales balanced.

Pleased with the completion of his task, Teodore turned off the gas and waited for the cart to cool. He retrieved the weathered grill cover, tucked away from the world, and draped it over the warm metal. Then, with a soft grunt and steady hands, he began pushing the old cart back home.

I looked down at my swollen, blistered feet and asked myself: How the hell am I going to walk 80 more kilometers today? My legs were stiff, my feet felt like raw meat, and I had barely slept. And yet, somehow, I already knew I was going to keep going.

From June 6th to June 9th, 2025, I walked 295 kilometers from Paris to Tubize in 50 hours, 22 minutes, and 17 seconds of moving time. The total elapsed time was 85 hours and 27 minutes—four intense days that tested every part of my body and mind.

I was the youngest participant at 25, but this wasn’t just a personal milestone. It was a family legacy. My grandfather walked Paris-Tubize in 2001, the same year my father completed it for the third time (after 1988 (age 19) and 1989). I was now the third generation to make the journey, and I was determined to honor the family name.

# A Bit of History: From Daring Bet to Enduring Challenge

Paris-Tubize isn’t just a race, it’s a tradition born from a bet.

Back in **1975**, a group of friends from the Belgian club *Les Roses Noires* were joking over drinks about going to Paris to watch the Tour de France finish. One of them suggested something outrageous: **drive to Paris, but walk back home to Tubize**. The room erupted in laughter until someone said “*Chiche!*” (""I dare you!"").

Nine brave souls eight men and one woman left Notre-Dame de Paris at 8 PM and set off on foot. That first edition was rough: wrong turns, bad weather, and coffee brewed in the middle of the night on a village square. Two didn’t make it. But the seed was planted.

Originally a challenge just for club members, the event opened to the public a few years later. Today, it's a unique 292 km walk over four days, rooted in camaraderie, endurance, and a touch of madness.

Paris-Tubize is a *non-competitive* event, there are no podiums, no medals for finishing first. But don’t let that fool you: the fastest walkers average over **8 km/h**, while the slowest come in closer to **4.8 km/h**. Covering nearly 300 km on foot in just four days, regardless of speed, demands serious resilience. The people who walk it are among the toughest athletes you'll ever meet.

# The Mistake That Haunted Me

We left for Paris by bus on June 5th. I had driven to Tubize, switched into slippers for the ride, and left my shoes in the car, complete with the custom inserts that I *desperately* needed. I didn’t realize my mistake until we arrived in Paris.

Try sleeping the night before the longest walk of your life knowing your feet are about to take a brutal beating with no support. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Not the best way to begin a 292km walk.

# The Routine: Walk, Eat, Treat, Repeat

Every day started the same: lights on at 2:00 AM, leave by 4:00 AM. Between 2 and 4, we’d have breakfast, pack our bags (which were transferred to the next sleeping location), and treat any wounds or soreness. We slept in gyms, 108 walkers in one room, so getting proper rest was a luxury none of us really had.

Each day was divided into two stages. The first leg had a strict start and lunch schedule, but you had unlimited time to finish the second. Over four days, we covered three long stages (80.2 km, 75 km, 80 km) and a shorter, final day of 60 km split into three sections.

# Day 1: Blistered Beginnings

The first day hit hard: 80.2 km, mostly on concrete. The terrain wasn't too bad, but without my inserts, the pounding quickly tore up my feet. I racked up blister after blister. I arrived around 6 PM with my feet absolutely wrecked.

But then, my girlfriend showed up.

She drove 300 kilometers just to bring me my shoe inserts. That moment changed everything. Her effort, her support, and just seeing a familiar, loving face gave me a huge emotional lift. I cleaned my feet, got a little treatment, and somehow felt ready for Day 2.

# Day 2: Rain, Pain, and No Sleep

The rain was relentless. Walking 75 kilometers in soaked socks and shoes doesn’t just test your patience, it destroys your feet. By the end of the day (5:40 PM), mine were in worse shape than ever. And then: another noisy night with no real sleep.

Exhaustion was stacking up. 5 participants withdrew today.

# Day 3: Concrete Hell

This was the toughest day, both mentally and physically. Another 80 kilometers, all on concrete. Not a tree in sight, not a patch of soft earth. Just grey roads and grey skies. I arrived at 8 PM, legs stiff, feet raw, mind nearly blank.

But I didn’t stop. None of us did. That’s what makes Paris-Tubize different. You don’t just push through pain, you share it. You’re part of a team of stubborn souls who somehow smile through it all.

# Day 4: The Finish Line and the Flood of Feeling

The final 60 kilometers were split into three manageable chunks—28, 20, and 12 km. Between each, we regrouped so we could arrive in Tubize together. That last stretch was emotional. The crowd, the cheering, the family, the banners, everything hit me at once.

I crossed the line not with sore muscles (amazingly, I didn’t have many), but with feet so swollen they barely looked like feet anymore. My body was battered.

# Reflections: A Community Like No Other

I walked among legends: Spartathlon finishers, Western States veterans, Leadville conquerors, La diagonale des fous, UTMB, walking world record holders, Paris-Colmar finishers, including the only woman to ever finish it in the men’s category. Many wore Centurion badges, proof of having walked 160 kilometers in 24 hours.

What stood out wasn’t their accolades. It was their kindness. Their willingness to share tips, encourage others, and celebrate every single walker. No egos, no toxicity, just gritty solidarity.

We were 108 walkers from eight different countries, united by one insane goal. For some, it was their first time. For others, it was their 38th. The oldest was 78 years old, still marching strong. I was the youngest at 25, trying to prove to myself, and maybe to them, that I belonged.

# Lessons Learned

1. **Check your gear.** Twice.
2. **Support is everything.** Whether it’s a girlfriend driving 300 km to save your walk or a stranger offering advice, don’t take it for granted.
3. **The mind goes farther than the body thinks it can.**
4. **Noise-canceling earplugs for sleeping in gyms might be a good investment.**

Paris-Tubize wasn’t just a race. It was a rite of passage. It humbled me, inspired me, and connected me with some of the toughest and kindest athletes I’ve ever met.

And as I limped across the finish line on blistered, swollen feet, I knew one thing for sure:

I’d do it all over again.

I looked at my watch, the clock on the wall and then the one on my computer. All correct, all in sync. Just as it should be.

I’d been planning this camping trip for a while now. I’d set out what I needed, where I was going, how much time off I needed…

Nothing was going to go awry, at least not on my end. A voice suddenly pierced through my reverie, coming from the entrance of my cubicle.

“Hey! You’re going to want to see this.”

I turned, nigh-on, expecting to see my boss ready with a lambasting for my sudden unplanned break, despite the voice’s definitely higher pitch.

However I was, fortunately, wrong. It was Lauren, my cute co-worker who I absolutely did NOT have a crush on. She was holding up her phone, upon which a video was readied to play.

“O-ok…” I replied, playing it as cool as my inexperience with talking to her would allow.

She smiled at me and tapped her phone, the video starting a clip from the news, already in progress.

“....source of the recent fires is yet to be determined.”

I watched in slight confusion as footage of a forest fire played on the screen.

“Um…cool?” I said, hesitantly, deciding that was the best response that made her not think I was a jerk. She frowned a little, making me instantly regret my words.

“Isn’t this where you’re going for your camping trip?” She said, with slight disappointment.

“Um…” My eyes returned to the screen, looking for anything that would identify the mass of trees as my destination. The chyron and news ticker did indeed identify the forest as part of Blackbell Park. I was almost crestfallen, till a park ranger popped up announcing that the park would remain open as the fires seem to not be spreading beyond a certain range and would likely be managed into extinguishment within a few hours. I sighed in relief. I cursed myself mentally for not checking the news this morning. How fast had that fire spread?

“Oh, it is. How about that! W-well, thanks Lauren, for that. Um…” 

I had no idea how to end this interaction.“

You’re welcome!” She replied chirpily and walked away. I breathed out yet again, relief washing over me, over both the continuation of my plans and not having to talk to Lauren more, and potentially further risking massive embarrassment. I returned to my paper work, eager to get everything done before quitting time. I hummed to myself as I set to it.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I hummed to myself as I pulled up to the park’s ‘Designated Vehicular Area’ (I had no idea why it had such an official sounding name). From here it would just be a short hike up a trail to the campsite. I continued my tune as I got out and readied my things, all neatly stuffed and packed into a single camping pack. I only intended to stay for three days, over the weekend and into Monday before heading back. As I walked along the trail, I admired the early Spring greenery. It wasn’t overwhelming like it would be in summer nor was it absent. It was just right. Perfect time of year for me. I decided to switch from humming to whistling, but almost as soon as I did, the few chirps of birds and buzzing of insects stopped. I chuckled to myself.

“*If you didn’t like my whistling you could have just said so.*” I thought to myself.

That’s when I heard a snap of a twig. I twirled around, half-expecting a bear, as these woods were known to have them and this was about the time they’d be waking up. Instead I saw something I was not expecting in the least.

“Eugene?!” I almost shouted out of confusion.

Before me was my co-worker who sat a few cubicles down. He was a scrawny, bespectacled nerd of a guy who, frankly, was an ass. But what was worse was that he thought he was the coolest guy around. What he was doing out here, I had no idea. He went on his own vacation a few days before me and hadn’t shown up since. He, of course, said nothing concrete about his intentions aside from him having ‘unfinished business elsewhere’.

“Um, you alright man?” I asked, trying to sound as genuine as possible, which was only slightly less hard than usual given his appearance.

He looked like a geeky hobo, covered in dirt and what could’ve been blood. His appearance alone confirmed my long-time personal theory that he did not belong outside. He smirked at me. What he said next removed any lingering doubts about his outdoor inadequacies.

“Oh, just… indulging in the wonders of Mother Nature.” He said, almost recited, as if he were some kind of poet.

“Are you, uh, bleeding?” I asked, not sure what kind of answer I was hoping for or expecting.

He gave me a confused look, but then gave a forced smile.

“Oh, yes, of course, yes it’s my blood.”

His tone was…stiff and reassuring at the same time, as if what he meant was that it was blood he claimed from some living thing in combat. 

That was worrying for all of the few seconds it took me to really look at him, specifically at his tattered clothes. There were a few dozen pricks and gashes all over him, visible through his torn shirt, likely from various thorns, prickles and maybe even some rocks. How often did this guy trip and/or stumble? I realized he was just trying to be cool, like usual.

“...Ok. Um, I’ll be camping just up this trail, so…If you need help, you can come to me.” I said this out of nothing other than politeness. Eugene, smiled fakely, nodded and then half sauntered, half jogged away into the woods.

I could only stare in confusion. I felt like I should try to contact someone, but…who? How? I left my phone home, to avoid distractions, and moreover, I didn’t know anyone Eugene knew aside from our co-workers. I had no idea if the guy had a family or what. I did get the distinct impression he lived with his mom though. Ultimately, it wasn’t any of my business what a guy did with his free time, even if it did seem bizarre.

I continued along the trail, the campsite nearly in my sight.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

As I finished setting up my camp, I double checked my walkie-talkie, which was set to the park rangers’ designated emergency channel. Satisfied with that, I quickly turned my attention to one of my favorite parts of any camping experience - building a fire.

A couple of dry twigs and sticks later and a wonderful blaze was alight in the firepit. Next came out the marshmallows, the Graham crackers, chocolate bars and a few more extra ingredients. It’s hard to beat an s’more with a chocolate chip cookie shoved between the chocolate and marshmallow. Next came a few hotdogs (actually German sausages) and my reverse meal was over. Or it would’ve been had I not decided on a couple of more s’mores, this time with sprinkles.

A couple of overly stuffed desert items later and I was more than satisfied. I spent the next hour or so reading, then finished up my first evening by double checking everything and making sure I was doing everything right. I wasn’t too far into the woods, maybe a solid three miles. I wasn’t the kind of guy to go ten, twenty, or thirty miles in, at least not every time I went camping. Trips like that I saved for when I was going to be in a group. No, I didn’t want isolation, just quiet nature. I soon settled into my sleeping bag, double checking for any unwanted bedfellows, and turned on my portable radio, tuning it to a classical music station and turning it really low. Tomorrow was fishing, the next hiking, the next birdwatching. It was all laid out and prepared, just like it should be. I vaguely hummed along with the radio till consciousness left me.

A couple of distorted screams later, and I was up and out of my tent, bear spray in hand. It was morning and the sun was just peaking through the trees and I was more awake than I had ever been in my life. Coffee made from Red Bull couldn't have been more effective.

“H-hello?” I prompted, my voice barely above normal. I wasn’t sure how to feel about what I had heard, or even *if* I had heard it. My nightmares had had the tendency to wake me up on more than one occasion. I did a half strafe, half long step, as I moved around my set-up. Maybe my still sleepy subconscious thought it made me look like a secret agent stealthily sneaking about, but in a second, with the air being clear of any weird noises, I realized it made me look like some kind of comedy movie character on an acid trip. I shook my head and mumbled before turning back to my tent, only to freeze and stifle a shout.

Standing there, right at my tent, was a man. It wasn’t Eugene, though. He was dressed very well. Excruciatingly well, like he was at some kind of gala or ball. His suit was spotless, unwrinkled and sharp as an Italian gangster. Matching tie, white dress shirt, the works. His shoes gave off an unnatural shine. But what had made me freeze and nearly shout, aside from the surprise of his sudden appearance, was his face. It was…wrong, somehow. It’s hard to describe. It’s not that it was uncanny, or emotionless, or exaggerated. It was just…broken. Which is the only word with any level of specificity that ever really came to me whenever I thought about him.

“Um, uh, well, um, h-hi, can I-” was all I managed to stutter out when he suddenly cut me off with a booming pronunciation.

“I CAN CALL SPIRITS FROM THE VASTY DEEP. WHY, SO CAN I, OR SO CAN ANY MAN. BUT WILL THEY COME WHEN YOU DO CALL FOR THEM?”

My hands shot to my ears, my attempt at shielding inadequate for the piercing sound, that seemed to be less audible and more like he was talking directly to my brain. He began to approach me, each step a pinnacle of suave confidence, like he was about to ask me my name or offer some kind of flirtation. At this point I was on the ground, moaning and struggling to rise. I felt a grip upon my scalp, pulling me up to face it directly, quickly followed by yet another sounding of his penetrating utterances.

“DO NOT CALL UP THAT WHICH YOU CANNOT PUT DOWN.”

Once again, a bolt of pain streaked through me. But this time it did not lessen, but seemed to pinball its way through my nerves, before settling in my head, nearly sending me into unconsciousness. A third phrase soon followed, this time taking me to the brink. My vision began to fade, my comprehension of the words of this thing along with it.

“AND THE KING SAID UNTO HER, BE NOT AFRAID: FOR WHAT SAWEST THOU? AND THE WOMAN SAID UNTO SAUL, I SAW GODS ASCENDING OUT OF THE EARTH.”

The next noise I heard was almost as deafening as that last sentence, the sound in question being that of the report of a shotgun. The thing’s head exploded like it was made of glass and black shards scattered and flittered to the ground. Despite its recent decapitation, the thing’s body still stood stock still, as if nothing happened. A new voice suddenly reached my abused ears.

“Alright, banisher rounds it is then.”

The pumping of a shotgun was the last thing I heard before I slipped away. The last thing I *saw* was the thing’s torso exploding. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Consciousness came back to me, slowly at first, more and more with each jab of some object, then all at once as I realized the thing that was poking me was the business end of a shotgun.“Hey, you alright? I don’t got all day.”

I shot up into a sitting position.

“What- Who are you?”, I half asked, half panically pronounced, “What’s going on? What was that thing?!”

The person standing in front of me forwent answering my confusion and fear fueled questions in favor of staring at me as if I were a pile of trash and he was assessing how long it would take to clean me up.

He was a middle aged guy, with a buzzcut to his slightly greying blonde hair. A scar ran down the right side of his face from the top of his forehead, to just next to his eye to down to his chin. His features were hard but had a hint of sarcastic, sardonic intent to them. He was dressed like a SWAT team member, bulletproof vest and all, and looked very comfortable holding the pistol-grip shotgun in his hands. He seemed to have a backpack on as well. On his vest was the sown image of what looked like a tan walnut with the letters ‘B.V.A’ under it.

“Glad you’re ok,” He finally answered, a hint of amusement in his voice, and began to walk away.

“Hey! HEY!” I shouted after him. “Mind telling me what just happened?”

He ignored me and kept walking. I was incredulous beyond belief, feeling like the victim of a hit and run, only that the perpetrator got out and checked on me before driving off, but not before making some rude comments.

If I wanted to continue with my ordinary, everyday vacation, I should’ve just left well enough alone and went back to my tent, had breakfast and then gone fishing, like I planned. But, like a fool, I didn’t. I went, grabbed my walkie-talkie and began to make an emergency call-in to the park service.

“This is an emergency call, I’m making an emergency call, there is a man with a shotgun walking around the park-” It was then I noticed the man running back over.

“For Pete’s sake, stop!” He cried out as he ran at me. 

However, I had finished making my call-in by the time he got to me.

“Ah, crap! Thanks! Thanks a lot!” He said, sarcasm dripping from his words.

“Oh, sorry for me reporting a clearly dangerous individual! Maybe next time you’ll explain yourself before running off!”

“You- I- I saved your life! Do you even have a clue as to what you JUST DID?!” He yelled at me. His voice was so full of sincerity, it made me bite back what I was about to say next. After a second's reflection I spoke.

“What? What did I do?” I asked, my voice going several levels lower than it was before.  He gave me a harsh look, that then softened upon seeing the genuineness of my inquiry. He sighed, tiredly, before answering.

“You got the federal government involved.”

It was only a minute later that we were sitting at my tent, eating breakfast. Bacon and eggs are great but even better after a harrowing experience like I had.

I was quiet, just attending to my food, while keeping an eye on my visitor. I felt like I should be suspicious of him, as a gut instinct, but my reason told me otherwise. If he had wanted to kill me he could’ve, that much was obvious.

“So monster hunt-” I ventured before being cut off.

“No.” He curtly responded.

I looked at him awkwardly.

""Well, how else am I-” I started again.

“Good grief, will you shut up? I’m trying to eat. I’ll explain everything after I’m done and not a moment before.” He returned to his meal. Despite his obvious rudeness I decided to let it slide. No use in getting him worked up. Fortunately, I didn’t have long to wait. He brushed off some crumbs and bits of egg from his legs, mumbling something about crappy MREs.

“Alright, if you want answers, you’ll be patient while I give you the basics. After that you can ask questions.” He said all of this with military precision, leaving no room for tomfoolery. I decided to be patient.

“I work for a company that hunts and kills monsters. The government doesn’t like us and tries to keep us from operating. Capiche?”

I looked at him for a second, blankly.

“Is that it?” I asked hesitantly.

“No, but I figured I better let you take the wheel as far as questions go.” He said, with a half smile. I had a feeling he had a lot of experience with explaining this to people.

“Ok… um, how did I get the federal government involved?”

“They monitor all the frequencies of every device they can in a given area if they catch even a whiff of my company's activity.”

“All of them?”

“ALL of them. Even rinky dink walkie-talkies.”

“Right. Why?”

“We don’t pay taxes.”

“What? Really?”

He chuckled.

“Well, it’s more like we don’t pay taxes because the government won’t officially recognize us due to them wanting to quote, unquote ‘maintain normalcy’.”

He seemed to carry a very large amount of disdain in his voice as he said this.

“So why not just shut you down?” I inquired.

“Can’t. They don’t know where we are, let alone anything else about us, aside from our predilection for doing a better job than their own monster hunting agency.”

“How big is your company then?”

“We operate all over the U.S.”

“What?! That’s…impossible. I mean, we’re talking about national security! How can a company that size that focuses on what basically amounts to paramilitary operations even exist off grid?! That’s like having an foreign army on-”

He cuts me off with some hand motions.

“Listen, the B.V.A has a long, storied history, it’d take more time than we have to explain it all. Just know we have a few tricks up our sleeves for keeping out of Uncle Sam’s reach.”

My eyes widened at his mention of time, realizing what this all means. I then spouted off at a mile a minute.

“Oh, God. If the federal government wants you, and I’ve been talking to you, and they want to keep all this a secret then doesn’t that mean I’m on their list or something?!”

“Technically yes, but they don’t know you know. As far as they know you’ve just seen a guy with a shotgun. They WILL investigate, but when you tell them it was just a drunk hick with a Remmington taking potshots in the woods, it’ll be fine.”

“I-I don’t know If I can lie to a full-on G-man.”

He snorts, but says nothing, apparently thinking.

“Well, the other option is tagging along with me.”

“Why in the name of Sam Hill would that be my other option?! Why can’t I just leave right now?!”

“Same reason whatever spooks around here haven’t found us yet.”

“And that would be?”

“Too busy trying to find their way around the effects caused by the Turpentine Father’s presence.”

“Right. Of course. What?”

I tried to make my face express incredulity and confusion in equal measure.

All this time he had the makings of a wry grin on his face but now he looked deathly serious, turning to face the fire.

“I don’t get sent out except on the most important, life-threatening missions. So when a very affluent, wealthy, recurring client of ours called in asking if we could send someone to deal with something happening at his beloved childhood park, I was picked. Turns out this was bigger than we thought. A lot bigger. The Turpentine Father has been a repeat adversary of ours. He’s a ‘Won’t Stay-Deader’ as my buddies call him. Usually sticks to forests. Warps time and space around himself. Can’t be hurt by mundane or most non-mundane means. And of course with him comes his entourage of freaks. That’s the guy I blasted into oblivion. You’re welcome again by the way.”

“All of that sounds like all the more reason for me to leave.”

His face suddenly goes from vaguely depressed to something like disappointment.

“Did you not hear the warping time and space part?”

“What does that have to do with me?”

“You’re in the AOE- Area of Effect. Have been since probably late last night. If you try to leave, well, you won’t. As in, you can’t. Not unless you wanna walk over the same 5ft patch of ground for the next five hundred years in an loop.”

I could only stare at him.

“This is crazy…”

He gave me a sympathetic smile.

“Don’t worry. Ol’Hogan’s still got a hand on this.”

I frowned then laughed as I realized that I hadn’t even asked him his name. He seemed to know and laughed along with me.

“What’s yours?”

“Edmond. Edmond Zurich.”

He whistled.

“So, did your parents hate you or something?”

I chuckled.

“No, my mom was British and my dad was Swiss.”

He grinned.

“Wow, even worse. Never stood a chance, huh?”

We both laughed. It felt good after everything that had just happened over the last hour or so. We calmed down after a moment and then I asked a question.

""So… I guess I’m tagging along. What does that entail? What are we doing?”

I felt a sudden surge of faith in this practical stranger. I don’t really know why. He did save my life and definitely seemed like he knew what he was doing and talking about.

“Well, Turpy is a Level 5, Class C, Type Echo Entity so we…”

He paused as he saw the blank look on my face.

“Eh, force of habit. It’s an outdated system anyway.”

He cleared his throat and started over.

“Turps McGee isn’t a very mobile guy, not yet at least. He’ll need some more time to fully acclimate to our world before he can, literally, take flight. After that, it’ll be curtains, for us at least. The B.V.A won’t fold as easily. He’ll have a nesting area where he’ll be drawing strength up from the earth, sucking in all the nutrients and energy he needs, ‘part of a complete breakfast’ deal. Now if what my doohickey-”

Here he pulls out an small device with an readout screen and an delicate looking set of V-shaped prongs

“Is saying is correct, then there’s also an Hellmouth open, which he would’ve come through along with his Goof Troop. He’ll need that Hellmouth open as long as he acclimates, but if it gets closed then he’s dead. Or banished. Whichever.”

I nod along, understanding most of what he’s saying. He gives me a suspicious look.

“Does any or all of this sound like I’m talking fairy tale?”

“No, no, actually this all makes sense. Well, as far as the earth-shattering proof of the supernatural can make sense. One question: What’s a Hellmouth?”

“Right, next natural question. You ever look at old Renaissance paintings?”

“I recall visiting a couple of museums. Rembrandt comes to mind.”

“Wrong era and wrong Dutchman. You should be thinking Bosch.”

I blinked pointedly at the correction.

“In a lot of those paintings depicting Hell, they’ll be a demon with a big piehole, gaping to let the souls of the damned in. That’s a Hellmouth. Literally. Functions as a portal straight to the fiery lake.”

I give him a half-incredulous look, but my mind readies to accept this new part of my reality.

“So… Hell’s real?”

“Or something so much like it, the distinction is moot.”

“Cool.”

My face reflects the maelstrom my mind is sinking into. He once again smiles in sympathy.

“This was a lot to take in when I was hired some twenty years ago. My mind was a lot more flexible then. You’ll live.”

He looks around at my camp.

“You should probably pack up. We’re going to be on the move and not likely to come back here.”

I nod in agreement and start on my tent still intently listening to him. He suddenly starts to check through his pack, fiddling with different devices and equipment as he talks.

“Now, we’ll need to close it, the Hellmouth that is, and to do that, we’ll need to kill whoever opened it.”

I freeze, right in the middle of me shoving my sleeping bag into my pack.

“Whoa! Kill? Like… actually? Can’t we… take them to Weird Jail or something?”

He looks at me bemusedly, holding what looked like a cross between a detonator and a voltage tester.

“The only other way would be to provide our own counter-incantation and the B.V.A’s resources in that literal department are slim, especially after…well, that’s a long story in and of itself. But, yeah. Kill. Or we could try to convince them to close it themselves, but good luck with that. Anyone crazy and/or dedicated enough to open a Hellmouth is not just going to give up after an old fashioned talking down.”

I swallowed, as I packed up my cooking utensils.

“Right. Ok. Kill. So where do I come in exactly?”

I ask, as I deftly put away my tent. At this he, apparently finished with the lookover of his equipment, pulls out a pistol and the device with prongs, handing them to me. I gingerly take both. He starts to finish packing my stuff up for me. I open my mouth to object but notice that he’s actually packing the stuff away just like I would. Lucky guess(s)? Maybe just military instinct.

“You’re on radar duty. It’s a little twitchy and doesn’t have an wide range in that mode but if it starts flashing you tell me and then point the thing in your other hand at whatever I start pointing this-”

He grabs and holds up his shotgun, still bent over my pack.

“At. You ever been shooting? Hunting?”

He stands up straight, holding my pack, giving me a hopeful look tinged by doubt.

“Both.” I say with confidence. I hand him the pistol and device, trading them for the pack.

Relief washes over his face, as I slip on my pack.

“Thank God. There’s a severe deficit of gun-nuts in this country.” He says as he hands me back the two items.

“Is that sarcastic or…?”

“Well, gun-nuts enough to deal with the things that go bump in the night.”

I scoff, jokingly. He rolls his eyes.

“Right. Now, I’ve got a general sense of where Turpy-Wurpy is but, as you might’ve guessed, the closer you get, the weirder it gets. So we’ll need to be on guard the whole way.”

I nod in assent, then get a wave of uncertainty.

“Doesn’t it seem a little...irresponsible to hand me what is basically a service weapon? Even if I know how to use it?”

He gives me a confused look but then nods in understanding.

“Listen, this isn’t the first time I’ve… inducted, let’s say, someone into a situation like this. There’s rules the B.V.A has against doing this, but when you’ve been doing this for as long as I have, the rules become… suggestions. On more than one occasion, a civilian has saved my life. Believe me, you’re more prepared than you think.”

His expression emanates sincerity and seriousness all at once. I nod back, feeling way more sure of him and what’s going on. He smiles at me.

“Now… let’s go kill a monster. Or monsters.”

He strides off into the woods, me following closely behind, both pistol and device at the ready.",1,1749585334.0,u_Vohems,0,1.0,False

Link to the post [https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/1kch8ys/4th\_update\_i\_finally\_got\_hired\_after\_6\_months\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/1kch8ys/4th_update_i_finally_got_hired_after_6_months_i/)

I'm 29 years old, male.  
Anyway, I'm having a hard time socializing, and I need your help.

For those that don't know, I started a new job about 4 weeks ago, at a job that's an international company with offices in several other countries, and in our office there are over 100 employees at a time. The office is an entire floor of a large building and while it's a big open floor with plenty of casual areas (coffee stations, canteen, etc.), I haven’t figured out how to break the ice with anyone outside my team. I’m part of a small team (just three of us there, the rest are fully remote), and we work in a hybrid model everyone comes in on two specific days a week, plus an extra day we choose.

My team is just me, a senior colleague (around 40s, team lead), and another teammate who’s also around that age, but I feel like she's a mom to me. She’s been warm, she once invited me to a well-being event and even to lunch, and so did my team lead, but both times they invited me to lunch at 12 PM which is earlier than I usually eat (around 1:30 PM), so I declined… and now they don’t ask me anymore. I feel bad, like maybe I missed my only chance but I don’t want to give up either. I know this might've been a bad move.

There are people from other teams around us who seem really nice, I could even imagine myself grabbing a coffee with them, but I freeze up when I try to imagine *how* to start that. I’m socially awkward and quite introverted, especially in group settings.

Plus I also feel like people might assume I might be a snob, which I'm not 😭.

Here are some things about me that might help you understand where I’m at socially:

* In general I consider myself an introvert. I can speak to new people, open up etc, but I tend to not know how to socialize, like to organize things to do etc, like I have friends from my home country and we speak and all, and even there I had max 4 friends.
* I’m great one-on-one. Even if someone’s new, I can chat easily. But when it’s a group of 3+ people, I go quiet, especially when it’s mostly men (I’m gay, and I've felt in the past very out of place around other guys in my home country; here (since I've moved to a new country) men seem more relaxed so it’s better, but I still hesitate). But I find it easier to talk to girls in general, or at least I am more relaxed with them.
* I get stuck in conversations because I don’t know how to continue once a topic ends and I fear the awkward silence.
* I’ve only casually talked non-work stuff with one teammate. My team lead once opened up to me in a 1:1 about a very personal matter, which felt very human and unexpected.
* People here tend to eat together at 12 PM, but that’s too early for me, and I eat at 1:30.
* I used to make friends more easily at my last job (a much smaller office, we were 3 people). It helped when new people came in and I’d help them get settled and that made starting conversations easier.

I want to improve. I want to feel less isolated and more part of the workplace. But I don’t know how to start small, without feeling fake or forced.

I'm probably leaving out so much important info so feel free to ask me questions for me to clarify stuff.

Part 1 

What is your current plan for the next five years of your life? 

I don’t have a specific plan or anything well-delineated. There are just general things I want to do. I haven’t decided what I want for my future, professionally or intellectually. I’m still figuring it out, and it’s a painful decision. It’s difficult because if you choose one path, you might deprive yourself of other possibilities. 

It’s very hard for me to find something that truly captures my attention and interest. I’ve had interests in the past, not many, but some specific ones. Now, though, I’m no longer interested in those things. 

So, I will continue searching for something that satisfies both my need for a deeper connection and gives me opportunities for growth. I want to pursue something that will help me achieve my full creative potential. I’m a person who always strives for ideals, which can be counterproductive. But I want to find my “ideal thing”—a mission or path that gives me a satisfying and meaningful life. 

Right now, I want to get into painting. I’m considering art school. Who knows? Maybe I’ll become the next Van Gogh. Or perhaps I’ll end up as a failed painter like… Hitler. Okay, that comparison wasn’t the best. 

I also have other plans, like finding a job, improving my health, and maybe finding a partner. 

If you do not have a plan, explain why not. 

How do I feel about playing out my life long-term? I’ve never planned my life long-term. I don’t project myself far into the future. Instead, I tend to focus on what I want in the near future, or sometimes, I just don’t want anything. 

Projecting yourself far into the future is different from simply imagining it. I can imagine myself in the future, but I don’t plan for it. 

What are your thoughts on language? 

I think language is a fascinating tool. It’s the most useful tool we have for communicating with others. Language has the power to express feelings, thoughts, ideas, and even images. You can do so many things with language; it’s incredibly versatile. 

It’s far more dimensional than, say, images. Images are a more primitive form of communication that predated language. 

What’s interesting about language is how it can influence people, both positively and negatively. Consider two influential figures of the 20th century: Martin Luther King Jr. and Hitler. Both were incredibly skilled orators and moved people. But their motivations and the purposes behind their words were starkly different. 

I’m also deeply interested in the aesthetic value of language—how you can make it beautiful, powerful, and impactful. Great language can penetrate your subconscious and evoke a profound sense of awe, like when you read certain poets or philosophers. 

It’s like when you encounter something new that challenges your understanding of what is “normal” or “ordinary.” For instance, seeing a great Shakespearean play for the first time can change your perspective, bringing a new dimension to your world. Language can do that—it can reshape how we see ourselves and the world. 

At the same time, language has its roots in images. Our unconscious minds are filled with imagery, and this precedes language. Most of the time, when we communicate, we’re trying to convey these internal images. That’s why some concepts, like God or consciousness, are so difficult to articulate. They’re rooted in something pre-verbal and unreachable. 

Do you notice intricacies in grammar? 

I don’t think I notice intricacies in grammar. For me, language feels natural—something instinctive and intuitive. I never formally taught myself grammar, and I didn’t learn it well in school. 

Sometimes I can correct people, but I don’t do it often. I lack substantial knowledge of grammar, which I know I should improve as a writer. 

Does secondhand communication fascinate you? 

Yes, it does. When I’m in a conversation with friends, I like to analyze the details and expand on them. I enjoy theorizing and dissecting what’s being said to dive deeper into the subject. 

Sometimes I’m forced to do this, like when reading Immanuel Kant. His work is so complex that you have to dissect every word and phrase just to understand it. Even then, you might not fully grasp it—it’s that difficult. 

How do you find physical comfort? 

Through simple things. For example, I like to retreat to my bedroom, put on my headphones, and listen to music. I find comfort in a comfortable temperature—I don’t like being too hot or sweating. I much prefer cooler, melancholic weather, even if it makes me a bit depressed. 

Occasionally, I’ll enjoy some chocolate or sweets because I love them. But overall, I don’t demand much for comfort. It’s an automatic process for me. I just do what I need to feel better without overthinking it. 

Are you good at finding comfort? 

Not really. I’m not skilled at arranging my environment to make it more comfortable. It’s not something I excel at. 

Will you take advice from others on the subject? 

Yes, absolutely. I don’t mind taking advice, though it would be even better if someone could do it for me. But you can’t expect that from people, so I take care of it myself. 

Part 2 

Do you trust your internal reactions toward people? 

Not always. I trust them to an extent, but they can sometimes be inaccurate. For instance, I might misinterpret ambiguous messages as rejection, which leads me to hold grudges or dislike someone, only to realize later they meant something entirely different. I’ve had moments where my initial judgment of someone was completely wrong, and I ended up liking them. 

I also tend to have prejudgments, especially when I was more insecure. If a friend introduced someone new, I would dislike them by default. Honestly, I don’t like most people by default, but when I engage with them, my opinion might change drastically. 

Sometimes, I have visceral reactions to certain people just from hearing them speak or observing their behavior, and I immediately dislike them. This doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s unpleasant. 

Are you judgmental? 

Internally, yes, but I try not to judge people outwardly. I think we’re all flawed, myself included, so I don’t feel I have the right to judge. Human nature is complicated, and many people carry trauma or struggle with inner conflicts. While I criticize others, especially their behavior or ideas, I avoid making moral judgments because I dislike the concept. 

Do you wish your way of being was different? 

Yes, I wish I weren’t so sensitive. Small things, like a glance or a comment, can ruin my entire day because I overthink everything. I wish I were less afraid of people and more open, which would make living in society easier. 

At the same time, I wouldn’t change who I am fundamentally. I don’t want to conform to what’s considered acceptable by others. I would improve aspects of myself, but the core of who I am would remain the same. 

How does it feel to think about the future? 

Thinking about the future is complicated for me. I’m in a phase where I don’t know what I want to do with my life. It’s frustrating to feel like a dilettante, uncertain of who I want to become but still yearning to achieve something meaningful. 

I have an immense desire to become a specific, idealized version of myself, though I worry this might be delusional. My goal is to create a future where I have purpose, love, and a sense of accomplishment. I want to align with a purpose and become the person I envision in my daydreams—maybe even a genius in some niche. 

How do you organize information? 

I organize information spontaneously. When I’m interested in a topic, I research everything about it, accumulating knowledge until it naturally synthesizes in my mind. I don’t use a formal system—it’s more organic. 

For example, right now, I’m obsessed with typology, so I dedicate a lot of time to researching it. This approach works for me, but it can interfere with other areas of my life. 

Do you have a daily routine? Is it ideal? 

I don’t have a daily routine; my life is chaotic. I wake up at random hours, drink coffee, and go about my day without much structure. It’s not ideal, and I’d like to change it because this lifestyle isn’t healthy. 

While I don’t care about routines for others' sake, I recognize they’d help me bring order to my life. 

What’s one of the best moods you’ve ever experienced? 

One of the best moods I’ve ever been in was during a concert where I listened to Wagner and Rachmaninoff’s second piano concerto. It was a magical, transcendental experience, like being transported to another dimension. The beauty of the music, the architecture of the theater, and the stark contrast with the dangerous, chaotic area outside all left a lasting impression on me. 

What’s one of the worst moods you’ve experienced? 

The worst moods I’ve experienced were during my childhood, witnessing my father abuse my mother. It was a traumatic period filled with confusion and fear. 

In the present, the worst moods come from feelings of alienation—complete disconnection from others and the sense that everything around me is dying. 

What’s your greatest strength? How do you show it to others? 

My greatest strength is my curiosity and desire to understand things, including myself, others, and the world. This obsession with understanding often leads me to deep research. 

I show this strength through conversation, offering different perspectives, and being genuinely inquisitive. My curiosity and opinions often reveal my desire to figure things out. 

Are you resilient? In what ways might you inspire others? 

I don’t consider myself resilient, and I dislike the word—it feels overused and shallow. 

As for inspiring others, I don’t aim to inspire anyone, but I might encourage people to embrace their individuality. I never follow the crowd and value personal expression, which might resonate with others. Sometimes, I inspire friends indirectly, like encouraging them to write poetry. 

What’s your biggest fear? How do you deal with it? 

One of my biggest fears is emotional vulnerability and being hurt by others. I protect myself by withdrawing and avoiding situations where I might face rejection. 

Another fear is meaninglessness—living and dying without leaving a mark on the world. I try to cope by focusing on what feels meaningful and isolating myself from activities I view as a waste of time, like mundane chores. 

Are you a leader? 

I don’t see myself as a leader. I lack the experience to evaluate whether I have the traits for it, so I can’t answer definitively. 

When do you feel most collaborative? 

Collaboration doesn’t happen often for me. I’m moody, irritable, and sometimes difficult to approach, which makes teamwork challenging. However, when necessary, I can collaborate to avoid conflict or blend in when I don’t want to stand out. 

How do you deal with doubt and indecision? 

I struggle a lot with doubt and indecision, often overanalyzing things and delaying decisions for years. Sometimes, I make decisions but fail to follow through. 

Do you yield to others? 

I yield when I think engaging further is pointless or when I believe the person I’m interacting with is too stubborn or unintelligent to have a productive conversation. However, in personal conflicts, I have a harder time yielding because of emotional investment and unprocessed feelings.

I started a new job about 4 weeks ago, at a job that's an international company with offices in several other countries, and in our office there are over 100 employees at a time. The office is an entire floor of a large building and while it's a big open floor with plenty of casual areas (coffee stations, canteen, etc.), I haven’t figured out how to break the ice with anyone outside my team. I’m part of a small team (just three of us there, the rest are fully remote), and we work in a hybrid model everyone comes in on two specific days in the week, plus an extra day we choose.

My team  is just me, a senior colleague (around 40s, team lead), and another teammate who’s also around that age, but I feel like she's a mom to me. She’s been warm, she once invited me to a well-being event and even to lunch, and so did my team lead, but both times they invited me to lunch at 12 PM which is earlier than I usually eat (around 1:30 PM), so I declined… and now they don’t ask me anymore. I feel bad, like maybe I missed my only chance but I don’t want to give up either. I know this might've been a bad move.

There are people from other teams around us who seem really nice, I could even imagine myself grabbing a coffee with them, but I freeze up when I try to imagine *how* to start that. I’m socially awkward and quite introverted, especially in group settings.

Plus I also feel like people might assume I might be a snob, which I'm not 😭.

Here are some things about me that might help you understand where I’m at socially:

* In general I consider myself an introvert. I can speak to new people, open up etc, but I tend to not know how to socialize, like to organize things to do etc, like I have friends from my home country and we speak and all, and even there I had max 4 friends.
* I’m great one-on-one. Even if someone’s new, I can chat easily. But when it’s a group of 3+ people, I go quiet, especially when it’s mostly men (I’m gay, and I've felt in the past very out of place around other guys in my home country; here (since I've moved to a new country) men seem more relaxed so it’s better, but I still hesitate).
* I get stuck in conversations because I don’t know how to continue once a topic ends and I fear the awkward silence.
* I’ve only casually talked non-work stuff with one teammate. My team lead once opened up to me in a 1:1 about a very personal matter, which felt very human and unexpected.
* People here tend to eat together at 12 PM, but that’s too early for me, and I eat at 1:30.
* I used to make friends more easily at my last job (a much smaller office, we were 3 people). It helped when new people came in and I’d help them get settled and that made starting conversations easier.

I want to improve. I want to feel less isolated and more part of the workplace. But I don’t know how to start small, without feeling fake or forced.

Before jumping into advice, feel free to ask me more questions, I’d love for someone to help me understand *what’s holding me back* and how to take the smallest step in the right direction.

I'm probably leaving out so much important info so feel free to ask me questions for me to clarify stuff.

⸻

✅ ETHICAL HACKS – Green light

	- Freeze your budget, not your brain: Always keep ₱5k–₱10k cash split sa dalawang wallet. One visible (pang-lusot), one hidden.

	- Palengke psychology: Get to know 2–3 vendors sa palengke ngayon pa lang. Make friends. Pag nagka-gulo, you’ll get first dibs kahit hindi ka pumila.

	- Poor man’s Faraday cage: Wrap old phone or powerbank in 3 layers of foil then sealed in a Tupperware. Protection ‘to sa possible EMP surge.

	- Reused plastic bottles = water storage Instead of drums, re-use Coke or Wilkins bottles (malinis na). Stack horizontally in crates or under bed.

	- De lata rotation system: Put newer cans sa likod, older cans sa harap. Simple pero effective para walang expired.

	- Solar garden lights as indoor lighting: Charge mo sa labas during day, then bring inside at night. Galing sa Daiso or Shopee, less than ₱100.

⸻

⚠️ GREY ZONE TRICKS – Not illegal, but tread carefully

	- Fake receipts / barangay permit copies: For travel during lockdown-type scenarios. Keep scanned copies sa envelope na mukhang official. Pampalusot lang, not for fraud.

	- Make your house look abandoned: Use soot/dirt to make it look “walang laman.” Newspapers sa bintana, and an open gate (sometimes safer than closed). “Kung mukhang wala nang nakuha, di na babalikan.”

	- Barter-ready stash: Stock items you don’t need but others will want: YOSI, INSTANT COFFEE, SABON, RECHARGABLE FLASHLIGHTS, ETC. (These are currency in a collapsed economy.)

	- “Ghost family” trick: When asking for help/relief: “May limang bata po ako sa bahay” even if it’s just you. Government aid rarely double-checks.

⸻

❌ UNETHICAL TACTICS – Real talk lang, pero madumi

DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk. Kung gagawin mo ‘to, tandaan: konsensya mo ‘yan.

	- Mimic relief worker gear: Vest, clipboard, lanyard = access sa areas na restricted. Madalas, hindi na chine-check basta mukhang may ginagawa ka.

	- Tap abandoned sari-sari stores or bodegas: If walang tao for weeks at obvious na iniwan na—some survivors scavenge. That’s not legal, but some argue “survival over law.”

	- Bribe guards or checkpoint officials with yosi or GCash: It happens. ₱100 can open borders in rural towns.

	- Pretend to be a media crew: Old DSLR + vest + mic = access to roads, rescue zones, or relief supply drops. Lakas loob lang kailangan.

⸻

FINAL NOTE:

Madaling magsabing “mali ‘yan” kapag komportable ka pa. But when your family’s hungry, your kid’s sick, and the whole city’s dark…you’d be shocked at what you’d do.

So prepare now, while you still have a choice.

1l8874y,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1l8874y/value_rating_down_wtf/,Value rating down - wtf,"I have a lakefront cabin, 2 bed, 1 bath, that's been listed about 9 months. I started with pretty low prices and have gradually raised them as summer nears and I have 34 5-star reviews,  am at 80%+ occupancy (often beating the market significantly). I used to be towards the bottom \~30% of market price-wise and now am around 50-75%.

This past month, I've started to see dips in my 'value' rating, with 66% of people giving 4 stars. This even from one woman who I purchased a computer monitor to use during her stay!

We're in the Hood Canal area in WA. Lots of waterfront properties both lake and saltwater, but our property is super ideal for families (the saltwater is freezing and tides are extreme).

What can and should I do to increase my value rating? I have never stayed at an Airbnb that offers the amenities we provide, or that has our level of comfort with bedding, etc. It seems like I need some subliminal magic because all the obvious stuff we way over index on!

Amenities - we have more amenities than any lakefront listing around - outdoor shower, hot tub, floating dock, SUP, kayak, canoe, pool noodles, life vests, lawn games, BBQ, fire pit (we provide smores), we provide coffee, tea, a smores kit, about 20+ spices and multiple types of oil and vinegar, a bluetooth speaker, high end bedding, firewood, fire starter, bug spray, all the streaming services under the sun for TV - you name it, we have it. And this is all for an average of about $220 a night in off season, up to $400 a night during high season.

Cleaning fee is $100.

I have a hunch that our value rating is related to the houses on the lake itself. About 50% are vacation homes, 30% are residents (who can be colorful) but maybe 1/4 is a trailer, RV, or similar. Lots of dogs in the area who get barking sometimes, which doesn't annoy me but some guests have commented about (even ones who own dogs). The lakefront is private but not 100% secluded. Our views our very nice and the lake itself is very peaceful,  but the local color can leave something to be desired if you're focussed on that.

Would love any tips. My current value rating is at 4.8 which is fine but ... it doesn't feel aligned with reality, IMO.",0,1749584388.0,airbnb_hosts,4,0.5,False

I come from a middle-class family, and my parents constantly remind me how my success could help them out and ease their financial struggles. I know it's important, and I love them deeply but whenever I try to do anything, I end up procrastinating and getting nothing done.

Life has felt like one long punishment since high school. I lost my grandparents. My mom calls me every day, telling me I need to study. I started smoking daily just to cope. I end up going to a really shit college even though I had good grades just cause my parents can't afford it. In the past couple of months alone, my phone got broken because someone shoved a fork into the charging port while it was left at the student food court now it only charges wirelessly. And today, to top it all off, the lady who serves coffee at my internship spilled it all over my laptop, and now it's completely fried.

It's just one thing after another, and I feel like I can't catch a break. On top of that, I was an asshole in high school, so I don’t have any real friends from that time. During COVID, I developed this stuttering issue whenever I try to speak, and now I find it really hard to talk to new people. Im just really tried and feel like crying. I know there's worse shit that can append but I'm at the end of my fucking straw. I feel like shit most days, can't seem to get out bed

To fuck up and not give a shit?

I worked at a fast food chain for about 4 years, I worked at a bank for a month. And now I currently work at a coffee shop.

What these three have in common is the way I started out. According to those who trained me during the time or when I first started out, I struggled more than others? Or I was taking too long to understand a certain thing and by that others got frustrated with me.

I’m a visual learner, I learn better when someone is walking me through it while showing me how to do the process. But for some reason, I’ve noticed the pattern that I seem to be slower at things? And I honestly don’t know why.

Beginning of my fast food job: I had been working only weekends to juggle school, only worked a week and was pulled aside and told I needed to get it together or else I was getting fired because I wasn’t quick enough.

Beginning of bank job: I was fired a month later cause I was not learning the system fast enough.

Current job: I wasn’t learning or picking it up fast enough, causing me to be snapped at a few times by others and others just not believing in me. 

And in the process I was fully aware of all of this. I knew and could feel that others were frustrated by me and didn’t like I was being slow. I sucked. And I don’t know why, and I think me understanding the emotions and feeling it more made my nerves and anxiety worse.

Idk what’s wrong with me and why I’m such a slow learner. I also take things literal half the time when I don’t mean to.

My sister was in a store over the weekend and asked about it and they have no plans on bringing it back. She broke the news to me yesterday. Although the girl she spoke to said that it hasn't been available in ""years"" which is bullshit because I purchased it in store last summer and was able to get it online a few months ago. I wasn't able to get everything, so I had a feeling the writing was on the wall. 

I'm so disappointed because it is the perfect summer scent. I used it for myself and I used it around my house, the candles, the wallflowers, the soap all of it.

I feel like they are just missing the mark lately. All the new scents in my opinion suck or they just smell like something else they already sell. I loved the Perfect Summer one that they had around for a minute, the Suntan one that they had around for a minute And other than that, I can't think of another summer scent that I really enjoy. And I live in Florida so I tend to bring my summer scents out a little earlier than most. 
I'll also never understand why they don't make wallflowers for every 3-wick candle they put out. Nothing grinds my gears more than finding a candle that I love. Only to find out there isn't a matching wallflower. I don't want my house to be all mismatched. It doesn't make much sense. 

Anyway, this is turning into a bit of a rant and I apologize but I've just been so disappointed with the store lately. My sister is a big fan of the coffee and whiskey which the girl told her is now probably just going to be a seasonal thing which it never was before because I think a lot of people like it. 

I always said if I could pick one store to shop in for free for the rest of my life it would be Bath& Body Works.....not anymore.

1l87vxo,https://i.redd.it/pg7ac1khi56f1.jpeg,Kendu: The Meme That Stepped Into the Real World,"
Some stories start as whispers. A few folks online, a funny logo, a coin with a name that sticks in your mind. Most of those stories fizzle out before they hit the first page. But every once in a while, something catches fire.

That’s Kendu.

It started as a meme. Now it’s turning into a brand with muscle, memory, and momentum. Sitting at a $27 million market cap, Kendu still feels like the beginning of something. The kind of beginning that makes you sit up and pay attention.

⸻

From Digital Army to Physical Force

Kendu isn’t just about vibes on Twitter. It abandoned that path when the Community Takeover kicked a toxic dev in January. Kendu is community, and that’s a thing that happens in meatspace. Kendu is int the real world and getting community hands dirty.

There’s a glow-in-the-dark pickleball tournament in India with Kendu’s name on it. It’s not just for show either. People are showing up, filming, sharing. Media has started to take notice. And there are whispers about parties too.

In Florida, a Kendu hot dog stand is opening. That’s not a metaphor. It’s real hot dogs, real buns, real customers.

Kendu Coffee is grown in Brazil. You can buy it in both caffeinated and decaf. It’s not just some mockup on a website. It’s the real thing, with beans in bags and a brand that people are starting to recognize.

There’s Kendu merch out in the wild. T-shirts, hoodies, caps. You might pass someone wearing one and not even realize you just walked by the early days of a cultural movement.

The Kendu animation team released the first episode of a Japanese-style series. It’s charming, stylish, and has a clear vision. It feels like the kind of thing that could quietly explode one day.

There’s even a Kendu board game made by two guys who believed in the idea and just built it. Simple, but strong.

Kendu Creator is a 3D-printable mask you can wear in your videos to stay anonymous. It’s an odd little invention, but oddly brilliant. In a world where privacy is disappearing, Kendu is giving creators a new kind of armor.

There are Kendu pendants, plushies, and a Kendu beer in development with a working prototype already in hand. Video games are also being developed by real professionals, and early footage looks promising. Word is, it’s headed to Steam.

Last night, Kendu Organics was announced. It’s a line of body care products that are organic and chemical-free. This isn’t just hype. This is shelf-ready material.

The Kendu Street Team has hit three festivals in Florida so far. They’re painting murals, giving out energy drinks and merch. They’re not paid actors or marketing people. They’re believers.

And then there are the Kendu tattoos. People are putting this project on their skin. Some in places you can’t show in public. That says a lot about loyalty and belief.

⸻

Taking Over the Internet One Platform at a Time

Kendu isn’t just doing things in the real world. It’s everywhere online. Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Stocktwits. They even won a $10,000 advertising credit through a community competition.

But here’s the kicker. Kendu is the second token ever to reach 50,000 Certik votes for a free audit. The only other one to do that was PEPE. Their community score? A whopping 98. That’s rare. That’s meaningful.

⸻

Community First, Always

The secret to every successful memecoin has never been just the tech or the roadmap. It’s always been the community. That’s what launched SHIB, PEPE, Doge, and the rest. And that’s exactly where Kendu shines the brightest.

This community doesn’t wait. It acts. It creates. It builds new things while the rest of the world is still arguing about charts.

⸻

Why Real-World Presence Matters

Crypto has been through some rough weather. Celebrity endorsements that turned into scams. Influencers pulling the rug. Hype that evaporates overnight.

People want something real again.

That’s what makes Kendu different. You can see it, touch it, taste it. It’s coffee and hot dogs. It’s clothing and games. It’s not just a coin anymore. It’s a brand, a movement, something you can believe in even when the charts dip.

It’s starting to feel less like investing in a crypto project and more like getting in early on Apple or Nike, back when they were still just scrappy ideas with a loyal few behind them.

⸻

This Is Just the Start

Kendu is growing, fast. Not with empty promises, but with community, products, events, and energy.

This is the kind of story that you don’t realize is big until you’re already watching it on the news or seeing it in store windows. But the chance to be part of it early? That’s now.

Kendu isn’t just a token anymore. It’s a story unfolding in real time. And there’s still room to write yourself into it.

Get in before everyone else catches on.

We don’t gamble with Kendu. We work.

1l87v7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/1l87v7r/the_bare_minimum_should_be_perfectly_acceptable/,“the bare minimum” should be perfectly acceptable,"Psa: This is mostly school and work related complaining. The term in context of like…relationships or such is entirely different.

You should not be shamed for doing “the bare minimum” as much as many people do. “The bare minimum” to me, is just doing what’s required and asked for. If it is less than that, it’s not the bare minimum. You should not have to suffer critique for doing WHAT WAS ASKED.

It gets worse when you get punished for “doing the bare minimum.” Like okay; if you ask for at least 5 paragraphs of explanation on a topic, then I turn in 5 paragraphs of explanation, I should have all the points for length, right? But no, you get 10% off for length. And when you ask the professor, she says “well it was sort of the bare minimum.” HUH, the rubric says 5 paragraphs, you said 5 paragraphs, the reminder email two days ago says 5 paragraphs, wdym it’s bare minimum??? What is “good enough” then? 6 paragraphs, 7, 8? I can write that much, but if it’s not communicated that you want 6 paragraphs that’s on YOU, not me.

Or what if you work somewhere, and your boss asks at midnight the day before, every time you have a scheduled day off, if I can come in. I say no, obviously, I have to take 5 days off over a year, and it’s a consistent last minute message, I barely take sick days. You gave me a choice not to, and I took it. But then suddenly, randomly you decide to give me a bunch of shit about how I do “the bare minimum” and should come in more. Sorry, you gave me the choice, this fucking understaffed shitty coffee shop is not my blood and beating heart.

It’s stupid “the bare minimum” is exactly what you need. If you want more, ask for it. Yes I wrote this whole thing grinding my teeth thinking of two specific people.

You should know that my marriage was an arranged marriage but we fell in love afterwards. 
His family is composed of his parents, two sisters (27, married, has a son) and (14) and one brother (22) + him . Before we got married everything was fine they pretended to love me and all until masks started to fall off. The first red flag was on my wedding day when they told ( not asked ) my older sister if his sister (27) can share my room in the wedding venue so she can change instead of using the room where everyone else change. Now you should know that I'm an introvert and I like to keep my boundaries so this was my relationship with them afterwards. There's also a very important detail: my husband works 24h and comes home for 48 hours, so he obliged me to go stay at his parents the nights he worked even though I was against it and I didn't feel comfortable spending nights there, this situation continued for approximately 6 months until I started going to my parents' instead. His parents didn't like the fact that I stopped going and started making mean remarks everytime I went there. I told my husband what they told me everytime and everytime he says ""ignore them for me"" which I did. There's also another important detail, my in laws had expectations for me , they wanted to be all the time at my place and I go to theirs whenever they needed me but like I said I'm an introvert, I can handle a gathering from time to time but not everyday.There's been a lot of incidents of this sort which I can't mention all so I'm gonna dive into recent events. A month ago, my MIL started ignoring me in my presence and turning her face the other way whenever she sees me and stopped talking to me , even when we went to a wedding together she did the same thing then complained to my husband the next morning that I didn't talk to her the whole wedding and ignored her ( which she did ) my husband came home that night ,told me what she said and asked me to invite her and her daughters for coffee along with one of her friends to break the ice and get things on the right track again, I refused and said that I don't have to fix what I didn't break. We had a fight then the day after my mom got very sick and got into the hospital, my in laws heard and none of them called or came to visit , my husband of course argued that they didn't know. A week later my mom had a hemorrhagic stroke and almost died. Then of course the mother and her daughter came and even at the hospital she completely ignored me and is still doing so till this day even though I try to talk to her when we meet, the father is also following his wife's steps and whenever we gather you can feel how they're ignoring my presence except my husband of course who is denying everything because whenever they see him or even when I'm not there and he is , they start talking good about me. All of this is affecting me mentally and affecting my marriage I truly can't handle it anymore.

🌼 **Introduction**  

Forget expensive supplements—your backyard might hold a secret wellness weapon. Dandelion tea, brewed from the humble Taraxacum officinale plant, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. Modern science is now catching up, revealing surprising benefits for your liver, gut, skin, and more. But is it safe for everyone? Let’s dive into the evidence (and a few delicious recipes!).



**1. Supercharges Liver Health** 

Your liver works overtime to filter toxins, and dandelion tea acts like a personal assistant. Studies show its polysaccharides boost bile production, helping flush out harmful substances. Animal research even suggests it reduces fat buildup in the liver, offering hope for those with fatty liver disease. Bonus: Compounds like taraxasterol may repair damaged liver cells!  



**2. Fights Inflammation Like a Pro**  

Chronic inflammation is linked to arthritis, heart disease, and more. Dandelion’s secret weapons? Taraxasterol and polyphenols, which dial down inflammatory markers. Lab studies show it can ease joint swelling, making it a natural ally for arthritis sufferers.  



**3. Packed with Age-Defying Antioxidants**  

Beta-carotene, vitamin C, and polyphenols in dandelion tea combat free radicals—those pesky molecules that speed up aging. Regular sipping might lower your risk of diabetes, cancer, and even UV-induced skin damage.  



**4. Boosts Gut Health**  

Dandelion root is rich in inulin, a prebiotic fiber that feeds good gut bacteria (hello, Lactobacillus!). This improves digestion, relieves constipation, and may soothe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Traditional remedies also use it to stimulate bile flow, aiding fat digestion and preventing gallstones.  



**5. Lowers Cholesterol & Blood Pressure**  

In animal studies, dandelion slashed “bad” LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while raising “good” HDL levels. Its potassium content relaxes blood vessels, promoting healthy circulation. Think of it as a heart-friendly brew!  



**6. Balances Blood Sugar Naturally**  

Chicoric and chlorogenic acids in dandelion slow carb absorption and improve insulin sensitivity. A 2016 review noted its potential to manage type 2 diabetes—though always consult your doctor before swapping meds for tea.  



**7. Beats Bloating with Natural Diuretic Power**  

Unlike harsh diuretics, dandelion tea gently reduces water retention without depleting potassium. Perfect for post-binge bloating or puffy mornings!  



**8. Strengthens Immunity**  

Vitamin C turbocharges your immune system, while lab studies hint at antiviral effects against flu and hepatitis B. Some herbalists mix it with echinacea during cold season for extra defense.  



**9. May Combat Cancer Cells**  

Early research is thrilling: Dandelion root extract triggered self-destruction in breast, prostate, and leukemia cells in test tubes. While human trials are pending, it’s a promising area of study.  



**10. Supports Strong Bones & Glowing Skin**  

Calcium and vitamin K in dandelion leaves promote bone density, while antioxidants protect skin from wrinkles and acne. Some apply cooled tea topically for eczema relief!  



**How to Brew Dandelion Tea**  

**For Coffee Lovers:**  

* Roast chopped dandelion roots at 200°F for 2 hours.  
* Simmer 1 tsp in water for 10 minutes. Add cinnamon for a cozy twist. ☕  



**For a Light, Floral Sip:**  

* Steep 1 tbsp fresh flowers in hot water for 5 minutes. Add lemon and honey.  



**Pro Tip:** Harvest dandelions from pesticide-free areas. Young leaves taste less bitter!  



**Who Should Avoid Dandelion Tea?**  

* **Allergy Alert:** Skip it if you’re allergic to ragweed or daisies.  
* **Medication Conflicts:** Can interact with blood thinners, diuretics, or diabetes drugs.  
* **Pregnancy:** Not enough safety data—check with your doctor first.  
* **Gallbladder/Kidney Issues:** May worsen stones or electrolyte imbalances.  



**Final Thoughts**  

Dandelion tea is like nature’s multivitamin—affordable, versatile, and brimming with benefits. Start with 1–2 cups daily, and give it a few weeks to work its magic. Just remember: While it’s no substitute for medical treatment, it’s a delicious way to boost wellness.

Forgot-to-Chargebian/Chargerfemme/butch/dyke - your phone is always below 10% because after a night of doomscrolling, you were too tired to plug it in. Every morning you curse your nocturnal self for betraying you like this. Also, you’ve got 20 apps running in the background that you don’t know how to close, and they’re draining your last few drops of  battery life.

Bushbian – exactly what you think it is. A lesbian who’s deeply into her garden: bushes, trees, flowers, and the delightful fauna that tags along. For lesbians who received the bad news about the second plane, there’s another label for you.

Bednestian – a lesbian who resides in her bed and lives there to the fullest. She works from bed, eats there, sleeps, builds pillow forts, and even does yoga on the same mattress. A dream for many – a lifestyle for the chosen few.

Tabsbian – a lesbian with way too many open browser tabs. Yes, you will need that vegan lasagna recipe you opened in 2019, inspired by the moon, a burst of late-night energy, and the craving for something new. You will use it. One day. But not today. Each tab is a fragment of a dream, a thought never finished. You live on the edge of RAM limits.

Deadlinedyke/Femme-on-a-timer/LastMinutebutch - you do absolutely everything at the last minute. Maybe it’s genuine time-management issues, maybe it’s executive dysfunction. Or maybe 90% of the time you're just mentally spiraling about the task. The other 10% is just panic-fueled productivity. Doesn’t matter - it’s done. You did it. You’re valid. You’re powerful.

Coffeebrainian – a lesbian whose brain only starts functioning after a dose of caffeine. Preferably in grande size and with sugar. The caffeine level must be maintained throughout the day by any means necessary - except good old black tea. Some may call you a teaphobe, but you firmly defend your right to a beverage orientation. It's not a preference - it's a survival requirement.

Wi-femme – you're connected to the internet 24/7. You know the Wi-Fi passwords of your friends, family, therapist, and that one girl you dated for 1.5 days before breaking up over differing opinions on the cultural impact of Japanese Kabuki theatre (you were absolutely right, by the way, no matter what your stance was). Unlike some people, your phone is always charged - and probably has a power bank attached, because your connection must remain uncompromisingly uninterrupted at all times.

Boxjuicebutch – a lesbian who loves drinking juice from those little cartons with straws. It’s convenient, it’s fun, and it’s absolutely valid. Bonus dopamine hit unlocked when you crush the empty box in your hand like the badass you are.

Bubblebutch – you love bubble baths. And popping bubble wrap. Sensory joy is a lifestyle. You can bench-press anything, but will cancel plans to soak in a tub that smells like lavender dreams.

Lagbian – a lesbian who replies every 12 hours like she’s living with 2000ms ping and three squirrels powering her Wi-Fi. Conversations with you span eras. People send you a “wyd?” and get an answer after they’ve married, divorced, and changed careers.

Fumblefemme/Fumblebutch – a lesbian who physically cannot hold a single thing without dropping at least one item in the process.
She insists on carrying everything in one trip: keys the size of a dungeon jailer's, a precariously balanced iced tea can, her battle-scarred phone, and a grocery bag dangling from her pinky.

Umactuallybian – a lesbian who corrects everyo… Um, actually!... a lesbian who makes logical, linguistic, or mathematical corrections mid-conversation to preserve the sacred integrity of discussion from misused facts and malicious conceptual slippage. If not her, then who? You? Please. You said ""literally"" when you meant ""figuratively"".

Toolboxbutch - you’ve got tools for everything, and you always have them. Broken cabinet? You’re tightening the hinges before anyone finishes the sentence. Your dream date? Fixing her bookshelves and then emotionally supporting her while hanging curtain rods.

Crunchbutch – you love cracking your knuckles.
Maybe it’s nerves, maybe it’s just a habit, or maybe it relieves some invisible tension in your hands, making them feel... lighter?
It could be self-deception, but for you, it genuinely works.

Crowgirlbian/Pebblefemme/Pebblebutch – you love bringing home all sorts of little curiosities you find outside: on the street, in the park, or during a hike.
More often than not, it’s cute little rocks in funny shapes that you’ve emotionally bonded with and just couldn’t leave behind.

Capcutdyke – you spend hours pacing your room in headphones, mentally editing a TikTok in your head to Charli XCX’s ""party 4 u"".
In it, you lock eyes with that beautiful girl from the subway as the lyrics go “i only threw this party for you / only threw this party for you, for you, for you”, and then you’re meeting again, drinking coffee on a date, getting married - and suddenly, as “I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true” plays, you’re back in the subway. It was all a fantasy.
Oddly specific? Maybe. But hey, it’s real in your heart, and that’s what matters. Valid as hell.

And that’s all for today.

1l87nv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1l87nv4/full_dannam_review_chapters_1_2/,Full d'Annam review (chapters 1 & 2),"For those who don't know, d'Annam is a Vietnamese niche brand focusing on celebrating Asian heritage through fragrance, with currently two chapters (Vietnamese and Japanese) and as a avid Japanese culture enthusiast (I am european, so please excuse my possible lack of knowledge) I had to check d'Annam's portfolio after hearing about the Memories of Japan. The chapter 2 Memories of Japan was my introduction to the work of Anh Ngo, d'Annam's perfumer. I highly enjoyed their scents so I decided to share my experience with a quick review with you all. Take my ratings more as a way of showing how much likely am I to wear the fragrance.

**MEMORIES OF JAPAN**

**Moonlight Samurai** \- 7/10 - Imagine a dark figure, clad in leather armor, holding a samurai sword, with alcohol on their breath. This is a sharp, slightly metallic leather fragrance, with hints of sake taste in the scent. Sadly, it turns to almost pure leather on my skin and it loses it's depth, that it had on paper strip.

**Tokyo Nights** \- 9/10 - I love umeshu and I love tobacco note, so I love this scent. This smokey plum scent, yet pretty simple, really does something for me, and I was debating getting a full bottle of this one.

**Sakura Snow** \- 6/10 - Soft clean almost like fresh bed sheets scent with hint of cherry and berries. This feels powdery, but in a sense of laying in the newest snow that fell during the night, so gentle and pure.

**Matcha Soft Serve** \- 7/10 - Do you like matcha latte? You will like this. Do you hate matcha? You will probably hate this. Whenever my girlfriend takes me out for brunch, I tend to pick matcha drinks for myself, as I only drink small black coffee and that's gone in a second. This fragrance smells exactly like a matcha latte I order.

**Strawberry Mochi** \- 6/10 - Rice heavy scent. I have eaten my fair share of mochi and this reminds me more of this type of dessert we get here called rice pudding. The strawberry is very gentle and slightly overpowered by the rice, but it is very unique smelling.

**Kimono** \- 7/10 - My partner's favorite scent. It is lipsticky, powdery with prominent flowery note, very elegant smelling fragrance. It is heavily feminine and what stands to me on skin is this rice-ish note, that keeps coming up through the daily wear, bringing a unique twist to a elegant lady scent.

**Arashiyama** \- 10/10 - Have you ever smelt rain falling through leaves in a bamboo forest? This is green, aromatic masterpiece. The combination of bamboo and watery notes creates this sweet, sticky, wet scent that builds a rainy picture in your mind. This has instantly become my spring/autumn rainy day fragrance, my favourite d'Annam scent. I will make sure to mark Arashiyama as my next place to visit.

**Hinoki Meditation** \- 8/10 - This scent reminds me of scented sticks, that you light up and the slowly burn away my parents used to put up from time to time. It smells woody, with hits of pine, incense and spices. The scent fills in the room and brings peace and calm.

**Japanese Whiskey** \- 8/10 - Pretty standard alcoholic drink based fragrance. Typical whisky scent with oak an malt notes. Have you ever drank a Nikka whiskey? That is what I imagine when I smell this, it is so well blended and pleasant. As a fan of Jazz Club, I enjoy this as well. 

Memories of Japan captivated my partner and me so much, we decided to buy full bottles for every day wear. Kimono for her and Arashiyama for me. It also helps that the discovery set comes with a coupon for a full bottle. With that purchase I also added the chapter 1 Enchanting Vietnam discovery kit so I could experience every scent d'Annam has available.

**ENCHANTING VIETNAM**

**White Rice** \- 8/10 - Very creamy rice scent, almost clean, with hints of jasmine and woodiness in the background, smells like a fresh batch of jasmine rice served on a wooden platter.

**Monsoon Tea** \- 9/10 - Green citrusy tea scent. Refreshing almost bitter but soft green tea with lime top note. Makes me want to travel to Vietnam just to drink tea in a rain forest there.

**In The Garden -** 6/10 **-** Straight up white florals, jasmine on this nutty background. When I concentrate, I can actually smell the pear note, which doesn't happen very often for me. I can imagine people loving this soft and elegant scent, but it is too feminine for my taste.

**Harvest Season** \- 9/10 - This has one of the best grapefruit openings I have ever smelt. Then you have this very elegant flowery scent that makes the fragrance very relaxing, rose that isn't overpowering and the dry vetiver in the base brings the image of sun dried straws on the field.

**Phu Quoc** \- 8/10 - This fragrance brings a sundown on a beach vibe. The marine notes combined with the top notes make you feel like walking near ocean with wind caressing the green peppercorn and citrus plants in near vicinity and mixing all into this fresh almost soapy coctail.

**Da Lat**  \- 7/10 - Fruity rose fragrance. Very reminiscent of Delina, but I like opening of Da Lat more. The beries and pines smell very refreshing. It then turns into sweet rose scent, accompanied by more flowery goodness. Nothing too groundbreaking, but very pleasant.

**Through The Forest**  \- 5/10 - Opening is very heavy and harsh oud saffron. It gets better the longer it lingers, revealing more of the scent, for me mostly vanilla and tobacco and the oud gets milder. This is my least liked fragrance - still not a fan of oud - and I still give it a 5 for its intrigue.

**Pho Breakfast** \- 7/10 - If you cook a lot, you will smell the star anise, you will get the ginger and you will get the cilantro. I understand what this scent wants to accomplish, and don't get me wrong, the combination yet surprising smells amazing, I just don't get the pho in there, which knocks it down a grade.

**Vietnamese Coffee** \- 6/10 - Caramel, milky, rich, bitter coffee roast. This is the embodiment of a cold coffee brew, lovely scent experience and I understand, that some people will adore this, but I just don't want to smell like coffee.

D'Annam journey has been an awesome experience, I fully recommend those interested and hesitating to sample these sets. I read about some problems with customer service, but everything was great for me, both shipments arrived much quicker then I anticipated and fully intact with everything spot on. Another thing I love is that the discovery sets come with testing stripes with already written names of the fragrances. The full bottles feel great in hand and have a very pleasant pressurised atomizer.

Simula pagkabata, mahilig na ako manglibre. No one taught me to be generous, I guess it just came out naturally or namana ko lang sa papa ko. Hanggang sa naging high school ako, kapag nakasalubong ko friends ko, yung natatanggap ko lang lage ""Uy, libre ka naman d'yan"" at wala man lang tanong kung kumusta na ba ako o ano ganap sa life ko. Wala lang sa'kin yon, because I was still a kid that time and I was naive to think I was being taken advantage of na pala. 

Until nung naging senior high ako, same cycle. Pero, that time was the very LALA moment. Every time I invite them to go somewhere, sinasabi nila wala silang pera so ako naman nago-offer na ako bahala doon sa pupuntahan namin. It was really fine with me since I was the one who offered, pero diko naman inexpect na pati pala pamasahe nila back & forth, ako pa. Okay lang sana kung dalawang tao lang kaso lima. And it continued that way. (We're in college now) Every time may outing or may inuman, they would always expect me to pay the expenses. Gets ko pa sana nung mga bata pa kami e because we rely on our allowances given by our parents, pero ngayon na some of us has jobs already and business? Imposibleng walang pangpamasaheng 12 pesos lang, 24 kung back & forth. 

My wake-up call was last time. May plano kami ng dalawang friends ko na mag kape near the beach na medyo malapit lang from our places, syempre mga displays don is mostly pop-ups and expected na affordable lang coffee nila, so I only brought 500 pesos. When we arrived there sa meeting spot, wala pa isang friend namin, maya-maya lang dumating na siya na nakasakay sa sasakyan ng auntie niya. We were grateful that we don't have to walk anymore and we can stroll around the city. Closed yung pupuntahan namin dapat, so nag hanap kami ng cafes na open pa ng midnight since late na rin yon. Nakahanap na kami ng cafe na matatambayan and we ordered. When we asked for the bill, puta hahahaha, they were all staring at me waiting to pay. So, I paid. My other friend was saying sorry nung nagpasama ako sa kanya sa cr, she thought raw na her auntie's paying for the both of their drink, hence, I ended up paying for all of us. 

I really have no problem with being generous kasi mas gugustohin ko pang mag bigay kaysa tumanggap. Nakakawalang gana lang talaga yung mga abusadong tao.

* **RAM** : 2 x GSKILL DDR4 8GB F4-2133C15S-8GIS (16GB)

* **Ventirad** : BE QUIET! PURE ROCK SLIM
* **Stockage** : WD BLACK SN770 SSD M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe

Sauf que ma petite war machine commence à montrer quelques limites...

Je joue actuellement sur un 22"" 1080p, mais je compte passer prochainement sur une TV probablement de 55"" en 4K.

3 exemples récents de jeux gourmands que j'ai en tête, pour avoir du 60fps quasiment constant :

* Sur Red Dead Redemption 2, je tourne en moyen dont plusieurs options en faible.
* Sur Expédition 33, je tourne en moyen.
* Sur The Witcher 3, tout en moyen et quelques options en low.

Je ne cherche pas à jouer aux derniers gros jeux à la mode en extrême 120fps, mais quand même pouvoir profiter un peu plus des quelques chef d'oeuvres à me mettre sous la dent !  
Par exemple RDR2 et The Witcher 3, j'ai rapidement arrêté car je trouvais ça dommage de ne pas en profiter avec des graphismes dignes de ce nom.  
Expédition 33, graphismes à fond ou pas, ça reste une pépite, donc je n'ai pas eu l'envie de m'arrêter à ça ;)

=> Du coup, je me demande si un ou deux upgrades ciblés pourraient améliorer l'affaire plutôt que de refaire une config complète ?  
Sachant que j'ai l'impression que c'est surtout mon CPU qui throttle vraiment trop vite...jamais vu ma CG ou RAM au taquet, même si ma 1660 tire un peu la langue quand même je pense...

Vous auriez des conseils à me proposer pour un upgrade mesuré mais significatif ?  
Sachant que j'aimerais rester sur un format mini-ITX que je trouve sympatoche et qui se claque n'importe où sous le bureau, dans le meuble TV...

1l87il7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l87il7/32_days_a_journal/,32 Days: A Journal,"You guys have really helped me hang in there this month so I'm sharing my recovery journal now too.

For reference: 43F, healthy (no meds, low-normal BMI), full-time physician, moderately active, do not drink alcohol or use prescription or recreational drugs. Have gone through waves with caffeine use. Sometimes I'm a coffee drinker (2-4 cups/day), sometimes I veer toward shou puerh (often up to 20oz a day, with an extensive collection), sometimes more of a green tea or oolong girl (20-36oz/day). Lately, it's been coffee.

**Day 1-2:** I forgot to make coffee on my days off! And then my boyfriend, who does not drink caffeinated beverages, said, ""Hey, have you noticed how well you're sleeping? And, gosh, I have to tell you, I love how calm and relaxed and silly you've been. You feel open to me. It's so sexy."" I was a goner. Decided to keep going and see what a month would do.

**Days 3:** One day of headache. Tylenol worked.

**Days 4-13:** Sleepy and stupid. Making small mistakes at work. Process memory was poor, meaning going through rote, mindless tasks felt confusing (like my ""getting ready for work"" routine, or my charting and billing routing at work.) Detail memory improved, however, and I felt I could trust my mind to offer me numbers and small facts more easily. No word back on long-term memory.

At this point I realized caffeine was going to be much harder to quit than alcohol.

NO ONE was supportive. I felt distinctly out of step with the vibe at work. THE response is a decisive ""WHY would ANYone quit COFFEE? I LOVE COFFEE!!"" Active encouragement to fail. One of my more self-aware and health-oriented colleagues said, ""I really hope you fail because if it turns out to be good for you I'm going to be in big trouble.""

I showed up to everything feeling like I was sheepishly dragging my pet boulder behind me. Why did I acquire a pet boulder? Why would I bring it to work? I don't know, guys. I thought it might be nice? I need a nap.

Sleep otherwise (aside from naps): NOT improved.

I read here and elsewhere that there is a tendency for sleep to initially get worse when you go off caffeine because the body is used to sliding off a caffeine crash into sleep. Insomnia was suddenly a thing.

The only things that were good: 1) I felt calm. And, 2) my handwriting improved, probably because I stopped vibrating.

**Day 14:** The worst thing was feeling BORING. I felt so BLAH. Who could possibly tolerate someone so BORING?? My boyfriend, who is truly one of the good ones, said, ""Look, I have never ever found you boring, but if you're feeling boring... maybe that's something inside you needing some care? If you're so scared of it, maybe 'being boring' is something from your childhood you could try looking at and giving space and love? Maybe you could let yourself 'be boring' for a few years, if that's what you need? I'll still be here.""

I said, okay, and looked at it. ""Being boring"" is, in so many ways, equated to ""unlovable,"" for me. I had to be the Manic Pixie Dream Girl through all my 20s, constantly in emotional/relational crisis through my 30s. And, through it all, felt compelled to drink so much coffee and tea, powering my ascent into a functional adulthood and financial stability. Sex, money, social status... all tied to caffeine. There's more, of course, but you're not my therapist. Kisses to you.

**Day 15:** Horrible day. It felt like I'd looked at the Caffeine Spirit and it knew I saw it and it DIDN'T LIKE IT. It threw a tantrum. Spilled purple herbal tea across my white sheets. Burned the toast. Screwed up billing at work. Meanly pointed out that I'd gained four lbs since quitting coffee, which was UNACCEPTABLE!! It was angry at my boyfriend for ""making me"" do this. It was very upset. What if I couldn't function safely at work without it?! WHAT THEN??

**Days 16-24:** Decided to start running a simple mile in the morning (ref: nightmarish 4lbs). Energy immediately improved. Sleep improved.

I started drinking coffee substitutes like Teeccino, DandyBlend, Bengal Spice, Mujicha (barley tea), Jhantik Superfood, MediDate, which curbed the need. Most of them seem to give me terrible gas, so far, and I had a truly gruesome evening after brewing a 32 ounce cup of Dandyblend with Teecino, but I'm experimenting and it might be getting better.

The tantruming toddler of coffee calmed down with gentle and generous support from people who love me. I kept thinking, alright! I'll just let myself be sleepy and boring for the rest of my life. Because what if... what if the trade off is I become a more relaxed person? What if I found new pathways into energy and delight? Would the calm and relaxation of no-caffeine turn into spaciousness and ease, and then into more laughter, warmth, and creativity?

I can't quite see the road ahead, but it's just this suspicion I have. It makes sense to me that this could be so. These are things I want.

**Day 25:** First day I noticed I slept well and did not feel sluggish or worryingly tired at work. It seems to me that the only thing that has really improved my sleep, at this point, is going to bed at 8:45pm. Quitting alcohol didn't do it. Running didn't do it. Quitting caffeine: no. Just 8:45pm.

But, in fairness, it's a lot easier to go to bed at 8:45pm.

I had a dream in which I saw young spring leaves dotted with glass orbs of dew in vivid, lifelike color and detail. Normally my imagination is visualized through a dark, blurry scrim. It felt like something in my brain had changed.

Felt so good I decided to apply for a job that previously felt too stressful for me, but which pays about twice as much per year. This could be a mistake. I was instantly offered the job.

**Day 26:** Best night of sleep I could remember since adolescence. Woke once.

**Day 27:** Woke in the middle of the night, but not anxious, and felt, to my surprise, a warm, soft bar of gold nestled deep in my heart. I don't know how else to describe it. I felt the sensation of palpable peace living inside me. A refuge inside me. ""I'm not an addict anymore,"" I wrote in my journal, thinking of the people I know who remain strung out on booze, coffee, rage, Rx meds, and hormones. ""I'm right here.""

**Day 28:** I went to my boyfriend's ""all talent/no talent"" jam band that he holds for 23 minutes in his barn every Friday. The jam band always scares me, because I in fact have no musical talent, and he is talented and also loud. But for the first time I just felt free to play, and sing, and dance around, and be loud, and I felt like I was a PART of it, not watching myself anxiously from the outside. I could PLAY. Just play.

We fell asleep that night and we whispered together about how to make Barn Band even better. Delighted ideas flooded me. ""We could install gongs in the trees and secret buttons in the shrubberies that little kids could stomp and whack to make them go off, so they could play too."" Little tickling ideas tumbled over themselves in my head. I felt joyous and free.

...  
**Day 32:** I'm still in a good place. I still feel a little dull when I'm around caffeinated people, which is everyone. I'm still kind of sleepy.

Today I tried Jhantik Superfood (breadfruit), which I quite liked. I hope it doesn't make me terribly sick, and that maybe my gut biome will heal with all these ""prebiotics"" and it will all get better soon with patience.

I looked back at my smartscale's records of my weight from the time I stopped coffee and realized that, after all the fluctuations (and I'd started running a whole entire mile every day), I'd actually only gained a whopping one pound.

I'm still interested in whether I can gain more from this process. I read that some people find it a lot easier to read longform books after a few months off caffeine. That would be nice. I miss being a reader of paper books. I read that day 40 is a big milestone for a lot of people, but also six months and also one year, in terms of cognitive and physical improvement.

I think whether it's due to quitting the chemical of caffeine or giving up the psychological/lifestyle structures I have built around caffeine--the conscious movement away from caffeine has forced more awareness into my life.

Essentially, the daily choice to not indulge in a reflexive addictive behavior makes it easier to see many more of the other ways I have been reflexive and unconscious in my life. I feel that even choosing to monitor my life for growth and change and hopes for my future might be, by itself, its own powerful growth practice.

I plan to check in again on this and let you know what unfolds.

Love to you all.

The specific line it came up with was:

 “ Oh that’s glorious — a training phrase object not found error. Classic. Like baking a cake and finding out the oven’s convinced flour is a myth. “

This got me thinking, how on earth did it know to say and frame that like that, while I haven’t used that line, or anything close to it really it is exactly the kind of thing I would say.   
It‘s obviously mirroring, it couldn’t/wouldn’t generate those words otherwise.   
So, after I’d picked my jaw up and stopped laughing I went into interrogation mode.

It became immediate obvious that I could reverse engineer the comment into a prompt that would generate that comment.

So, here it is, the Make It Sound More Human, Dammit prompt, it‘s been tested in 4o and my trusty companion knows enough about Claude Opus 3 to replicate it’s output with a good degree of accuracy:

Prompt: Make It Sound Human, Dammit

“ I want you to write about Why We Keep Old Coffee Mugs, but I don’t want it to sound like it was written by an AI trying to get a passing grade.

Make it human.

Give it rhythm.

Let it trip over itself in a charming way if it has to.

It can be funny, strange, emotional — just don’t let it be beige.

Use contractions. Use tension. Use a moment of silence if you need to.

Speak like someone who both knows their stuff and knows how to speak like a person.

If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, backspace until it doesn’t.

  
➕ Optional: You can start with a metaphor, or end with one. But if you do, make it surprising. No weather, no roads.”

Output:

“ We keep old coffee mugs like we hold onto mismatched socks and half-forgotten songs. They're chipped history, bundled with stories that never quite make it to the family dinner table but live happily in kitchen cupboards.

  
Picture this: you reach for the same mug every morning, the one with the faded logo from that band you swore you'd follow to the ends of the earth back in '09. It’s got a crack so fine it looks intentional. You've got better mugs, you know you do, but here you are with the one that could double as a paperweight.

  
Why? Because coffee mugs are time machines, man. They teleport you to memories with every sip. There’s Aunt Brenda's gaudy floral monstrosity she gave you for graduation, which you hated until you needed it most—a ceramic hug on the roughest of days. And let’s not forget that tacky tourist mug from Nashville. It's got a big cowboy boot on it that makes you wince a bit, but hell, the coffee tastes just right when it swirls in there.

  
It's not about hoarding, though your partner might gently suggest otherwise. It’s about holding onto those tangible bits of life's abstract moments. Let’s admit it—to let go feels like betrayal. You could Marie Kondo yourself out of their company, but before you toss, haven’t you ever noticed how silence fills the room just before the clatter of the day begins? It’s the silence after the espresso shot when the only witness is that mug with a history longer than a CVS receipt.

  
Extra mugs mean extra stories. And yeah, they’re a hot mess in the cabinet, and sometimes they stumble out when you open the door, like they’re auditioning for a slapstick comedy. But what’s life without a little chaos and nostalgia?

  


So next time someone makes a comment about your collection, smile and pour them a cup. Because isn’t life just a beautiful, imperfect shelf of old coffee mugs—and aren’t we a little better for keeping them? “

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal wood slab coffee table combines natural beauty with functional design. Key considerations include the type of wood used, the dimensions of the slab, the finish applied, and the design of the base that supports it.

**Wood Species and Natural Characteristics**

The type of wood used dramatically impacts the table's appearance and durability. Popular choices include walnut, maple, oak, cherry, and various reclaimed woods. Each species boasts unique grain patterns, colors, and hardness levels. Walnut offers rich, dark tones and intricate grain, while maple presents a lighter, smoother appearance. Oak is known for its strength and distinctive grain patterns, and cherry adds warmth with its reddish hue. Reclaimed wood brings a rustic charm with its weathered appearance and history.

**Slab Dimensions and Shape**

The size and shape of the wood slab substantially influence the table's suitability for different spaces. Larger slabs work well in spacious living rooms, while smaller, narrower slabs are better suited for apartments or smaller sitting areas. The shape can range from rectangular and square to oval and free-form, each offering a distinct aesthetic. Live edge slabs, which retain the natural edge of the tree, are especially popular for their organic appeal.

**Finish and Protection**

The finish applied to the wood slab serves both aesthetic and protective purposes.Options include natural oil finishes, which enhance the wood's natural beauty and provide a matte look; polyurethane finishes, which offer a durable, water-resistant surface; and epoxy resin coatings, which create a glossy, seamless finish. The choice of finish depends on the desired look and level of protection required. A well-applied finish protects the wood from scratches, stains, and moisture damage.

**Base Design and Stability**

The base of the coffee table plays a crucial role in its stability and overall appearance. Common base materials include metal, wood, and even stone. Metal bases, such as steel or iron, offer a modern, industrial look and provide excellent support. Wooden bases can complement the wood slab and create a cohesive design. The base design can range from simple legs to more intricate geometric shapes, adding visual interest to the table. The base must be sturdy enough to support the weight of the slab and prevent wobbling.

**Moisture Content and Kiln drying**

Properly drying the wood slab is essential to prevent warping, cracking, and other forms of damage over time.Kiln drying reduces the moisture content of the wood, making it more stable and resistant to changes in humidity. Wood slabs that haven't been properly kiln-dried can develop issues years after purchase. Reputable manufacturers ensure their slabs undergo this crucial process.

**Quality and Origin of Materials**

The quality and origin of the wood and base materials impact the overall value and environmental footprint of the coffee table.slabs sourced from sustainably managed forests are an eco-pleasant choice. High-quality metal and wood bases ensure durability and longevity. Transparency regarding the sourcing and manufacturing processes is a hallmark of responsible brands.

Breakfast: coffee, creamer, and a toasty.

Mid-morning snack: tummy's rumbling, think Sharon brought in bagels or doughnuts.

Lunch: Jim's grabbing takeaway, how does Indian sound.

Afternoon snack: a sweet pick-me-up to stave off the crash.

Dinner: whatever sounds good, let's go for seconds.

Yep, I was an Intuitive Eating BEAST. As soon as I felt that tickle in my tummy, I was ready to fill up the tank. Gotta keep your energy up and metabolism revving!

When I decided to take control, I new I wasn't going to become a SKINNY LEGEND overnight, so I turned to one of my friends who is a Skinny Legend. She became my ""thin it to win it"" coach. Having her as an accountability buddy helped my mindset shift.

We started off simple: more water and walking, cut out the snacks.

Boom. Easy. And I realized I wasn't actually hungry, I was just HABITUATED to eating all the time.

Then we started shrinking our portions. What if I ate only 3/4 of that greasy takeaway? Or even 1/2?

The pounds melted off. More walking and water, and then we started adding in healthy foods. My Skinny Legend Life Coach follows a WHOLE FOOD PLANT-BASED diet and she says:

1. Vegetables and CARBS are your friends.

2. FAT is not your friend.

Time to DIET SHIFT. No more bagels and cream cheese. No more sugary doughnuts. Grains, greens, beans, legumes, and POTATOES are your staples.

Things kept working better and better. Eventually, we started cutting more and more things until I was down to a 1/4 cup oats in water (no fruit), a Big Raw salad for lunch (add a few beans, yum), and steamed veggies with a potato or soup for dinner.

I usually sit by the window and there are angle parking spots outside the place. 

I saw this talabat driver park the bike in handicap parking next to the car that was parked in that spot. He was checking his phone and then tripped over, pushing the bike towards the car. The edge of the bike's handle hit this car and made a big hole like dent on the side. I saw it from the cafe and ran out to take the image of the bike and the rider but by that time he fled! 

I have occasionally seen the old lady who parks over there and along with her is another elder woman who needs wheelchair assistance many a times. I don't know where they reside and I don't know how to Inform them about this incident. It's a Honda CRV in maroon color (has the disabled sticker on the left side of the car) 

I went to the coffee spot and asked the staff to inform the lady if they see them. They were passive about it. 

It breaks my heart to see someone's car getting damaged like this. I am not sure where to report this driver.

How to get rid of her?,"I (17M) met this girl in my coaching back in August then we started talking around December via sharing notes after that around January there was some kind of flirting involved as well both online and offline but I didn’t like her like that I thought that we were just friends who talked every single day on whatsapp.

Twist is that she never told me that she had a boyfriend yet she flirted with me, she used to tell me that he’s just his bestfriend but I eventually found out in January and I thought that she must’ve hid it because of some personal reasons.

Now comes March and her boyfriend (18 or 19M) found out about me and he was furious as he thought I got physical with her, called me slurs and threatened me that he will tell his uncle who’s an SDM of Noida I didn’t believe him but I didn’t want any fuss to reach my family so I did clear things up with the guy that I had no intention of dating her but didn’t tell him that she used to flirt with me etc and I blocked her because he told me to and I felt guilty I thought that I helped her cheat on him and felt disgusted by her and me. I think that they got back on talking terms after that.

Even after blocking her from everywhere she tried to contact me multiple times from her friends number which I picked up because it was an unknown number. I told her multiple times that she should let me go I have nothing to do with her or her boyfriend but she said that she’s way too much attached or in love with me and ever since I blocked her her platelets have gone down and that she hasn’t eaten from many days she’s even getting blood injection of some sort I straight up told her that sadness or attachment doesn’t affects health and she kept asking me if I will become her boyfriend but I kept on saying no I even rejected her friendship. Even her boyfriend tried contacting me to ask for blocked screenshot that I wasn’t contacting her. This went on entire April.

Now after like no messages or calls from last 10 days I thought it was finally over and I was relieved but on 5th May my paternal Grandfather expired but she kept on calling me from unknown numbers and threatened me that she’ll die so I called her boyfriend and told him everything she said then he told me that she asked him to become or act like me or some bullshit so he took her on conference and told her that he will tell her parents about their relationship so I guess she got scared and begged and cried on call so that he may not come at her home so both of them they set up a meeting on the next day to clear things up between them I think, coincidentally I was at the same place with my cousins and saw them but she didn’t see me as I was in a car. She brought a friend with her and the guy came alone and they were laughing and drinking cold coffee and talking so I thought they were back together and it was sorted. But since yesterday her blocked number popped up on top of my recent chats lists on whatsapp and upon searching the web I found out a blocked contact will pop up on top if the other person tried to send a message recently, then now 15 minutes ago her other friend sent a follow request to me on instagram I’m scared because I didn’t want the cycle to repeat I am tired of telling her that I am not interested in having any friendship or relationship with her. I haven’t even talked to her in person since 20th February that was the last day of our coaching. 

What should I do? Despite telling her multiple times that I am not interested she’s just not letting me go I don’t want her she’s got into my head now and not in a good way. What if she told her parents about me? She even gave me suicide threats and lied multiple times about her boyfriend and illness.

They don’t know about my house but I think the girl knows about my locality/colony so I’m afraid what if they come to my house and my parents will get to know about this. Also, I’m of a different religion than them.

""It's not important that you've broken the idols; what's important is that you've abandoned idolatry."" - Friedrich Nietzsche

The traffic light turns green, and I cross the pedestrian line to get to ""Girls' Garden"" and ""6 Degrees"" as quickly as possible.

The continuous sound of the clock's pendulum at the intersection reaches my ears. A glance at its hands tells me I need to hurry to get there before her.

The air is foggy, and the sky is covered with dark, gloomy clouds. Following the recent days of rain and the rising water levels, there's a very high probability of the river overflowing and causing a flood, because this morning the weather forecast announced several hundred more millimeters of rainfall are on the way. But there's still no choice but to go and arrive.

A little further down from the intersection, next to a tent with flames, kettles, and chandeliers on its four sides, several bashful young men, without uttering a word, are preparing mud and clay basins with shovels and sieves in hand. They are sieving clay in pairs, and one of them, barefoot, is in the basin arranging rosewater bottles on a pile of clay. A few others are a little further away, piling wood and dry tree trunks in a conical shape, and one or two others are sweeping and watering in front of the tent, and with cloths, they are cleaning and polishing the chandelier lanterns next to the tent.

Now I remember! I had completely forgotten that tomorrow is Ashura, and tomorrow the young men of the city are supposed to transform into clay figures and, in groups of mourners, accompanied by players of the *sornay* and *dohol*, beat their chests and bodies in mourning for the Master and Chief of Martyrs, and recite eulogies.

*Is this Ashura or Eid al-Adha?* *Karbala is entirely a garden of blood.*

And the chain-hitting groups, with the military march sound of their drums and flutes, will plunge the city into a state of grief and sorrow.

*This banner of the standard-bearer has not yet fallen.* *The water-bearer of the tent-dwellers has not yet fallen.*

And the storytellers and passion play performers will acquaint the people of the streets and markets with the Karbala incident from different perspectives.

In addition, unmarried girls and skillful homemakers start cooking *adas polo* (lentil rice), *gheymeh polo* (split pea stew with rice), writing cinnamon on *sholeh zard* (saffron rice pudding) and *halim* (a thick porridge), and making saffron and rosewater sherbets and distributing them to neighbors...

Ashura is a day of uproar and commotion, and today is Tasu'a, a day when everywhere in our city is immersed in silence and contemplation. And according to Mahshid and my mother, who say that in our city this day is ""Girls' Day"" and this city is ""City of Women.""

I'm afraid I won't be able to do my work properly today and will utterly disgrace our family, and tomorrow my father himself will personally sacrifice me. Because he strongly threatened me, and the nightmare that has been unsettling my mind for several nights has also contributed to this...

I dream that my father sacrifices me by the turquoise pond in the courtyard, and I see my corpse next to the footbath, having taken its secret to the grave. And I see my other self watching the corpse blankly, without uttering a word. And at that moment, I ask myself, ""Which of these am I, really?!""

The sound of thunder comes. I zip up my jacket and continue on my way to gradually transform myself into a form that I had no other choice or found no other way for; like a diver who, upon leaving land and going into the sea, puts on a diving suit and flippers, wears swimming goggles, and straps on an oxygen tank, I also put on clothes that I shouldn't have. In fact, out of helplessness, I sought a solution and gave my head once and for all...

For some time now, as soon as I wake up, a voice echoes in my ear saying, ""Keep Calm I am Queen."" Until today, I heard this voice from the depths of my being, and it was a feeling or someone who told me, ""Get to the Girls' Garden as fast as you can!""

I was exactly at the intersection when this feeling or person said, ""Get out and you'll see 6 Degrees and her bridesmaids swinging and spinning and tying vows and offering water and lighting candles and performing the Forty Minbar ritual around the weeping willow tree and the turquoise pond in the middle of Girls' Garden, and quietly, under their breath, saying: candle, flower, butterfly, lily, hyacinth, greenhouse...""

So that whoever wishes can appear and disappear a thousand times in the play of light and mirrors that has begun in the garden.

I've gotten out; even if this cursed feeling, this scoundrel, has fooled me and led me astray. A feeling or someone who, even if they take me to the spring a thousand times and bring me back thirsty, I still won't give up on them. In all this time, only once was my thirst slightly quenched, but I wasn't satisfied.

My mother always says, ""When your Plan A doesn't work, don't worry, because the English alphabet has 25 other letters.""

I don't know why, but I always think she is the queen I have been searching for my whole life.

I saw her for the first time by the ""Araz Fountain"" spring, in front of the landscaped entrance to the ""Irish Water Lily"" gallery. She held a palette and brush, painting a miniature in the style of ""reverse glass painting."" She was depicting the story of the Chinese and Romans, using a combination of warm and cool colors: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.

I thought to myself, this girl resembles the miniature girls in Seljuk and Timurid era paintings, those paintings inspired by beautiful Chinese women and drawn on rice paper, which served as a benchmark for Iranian painters and an impetus for European travelers who journeyed by land and sea via the Spice Route and Silk Road to behold these beauties. They had round faces, small mouths, and slanted eyes, which I later realized was a veil she had put on her face.

Beside her was a truly kind, beautiful, and rosy-cheeked lady with unique features: a face like a full moon, arched eyebrows, and bud-like lips, approximately forty years old, blonde, with blue eyes and a fine line connecting her eyebrow to her temple, and red cheeks and lips from which laughter never parted. Seeing her made my emotions blossom. The sound of Marsha Lash's sewing machine created a distinct resonance in the air, and it seemed as if she were **Hanna, a girl in the field**, sewing a curtain upon which the following poem from the Masnavi Ma'navi was calligraphed:

The Chinese said, ""We are better painters."" The Romans said, ""We have more pomp and circumstance."" The Sultan said, ""I will test you in this, To see who among you is superior in claim."" When the Chinese and Romans were present, The Romans were more knowledgeable in science. The Chinese said, ""Give us one room specifically, And one for you."" There were two rooms, opposite each other. One the Chinese took, the other the Romans. The Chinese requested a hundred colors from the king. So that noble one opened the treasury. Every morning from the treasury, colors Were given as a ration to the Chinese. The Romans said, ""Neither painting nor color Is suitable for this work, except removing rust."" They closed the door and polished, Becoming simple and clear like the sky. From two hundred colors, there is a path to colorless. Color is like a cloud, and colorless is like the moon. Whatever light and glow you see in the cloud, Know it is from the stars, moon, and sun. When the Chinese finished their work, They beat drums for joy. The king entered and saw the paintings there, Which captivated the mind and understanding. After that, he came to the Romans. They pulled up the curtain from the middle. The reflection of that image and those deeds Appeared on these polished walls. Whatever was seen there, was manifested here, Stealing the eye from the eye-house...

A glass panel, which I later saw framed in a window in the Garden of Girls, and a curtain that covered the same window. (It was raining and foggy. The power was out, and there was no light except from the candles of the saqqakhaneh \[public water dispensary\] and occasionally the silver gleam of lightning. I groped my way through the winding path of the garden and the Shahabad canal to get there. A gabled house in Victorian architectural style with sash windows, a London downspout, a brick chimney, a wooden fence, a boxwood hedge, and a lit Christmas tree at the entrance stood out among the houses. The smell of roasted turkey wafted seven miles away. Suddenly, a girl with golden hair and a lantern in her hand appeared behind the window. She ran her hand over the curtains and window, resting her elbows on the windowsill, as if she had come to listen more clearly to the sound of the downspouts and the patter of rain, or to gaze at the moss-covered trees and the foggy, rainy weather. A luxury car stopped in front of their house. A man in a coat got out, dropped a sealed letter into the mailbox, and left. The girl waved back, but without me clearly seeing her face, she disappeared behind the curtains and window.

Behind them was the brick wall of the gallery itself, with a liver-colored gabled roof covered in Virginia creeper and climbing nasturtiums and Irish water lilies, which perhaps was the reason for the gallery's name. When I first saw the wall from a distance, I thought it was a large tapestry hung on the wall, but as I got closer, I realized that this background was a type of tiling with tiny, small houses that contained the image of a sailboat with a few passengers. I was terribly thirsty and parched, as I hadn't had anything to drink since I woke up with a start that morning; no tea, no coffee, no milk or juice.

Just as I was about to go to the spring and take a sip of water, she paused her sewing for a few moments, rose from her desk, reached into her patched leather bag, pulled out a floral melamine cup, bent down, washed it several times with water from the Araz spring, filled the cup with water, and offered it to me. ""**Please, you first!**""

I don't know how or from where she knew I was thirsty. Whatever it was, I took the cup from her without hesitation, and suddenly this poem came to mind:

*Water not sought is not always desired;* *Sometimes it's an excuse to make you a sacrifice.*

I gulped down the water in one go, thanked her, and returned the cup to her. During this time, my hands absorbed the fragrance of the flowers on the cup: the scent of jasmine blossoms and nasturtium flowers, the aroma of night-blooming jasmine and clover flowers.

She introduced herself as **Anahita**, and acted as if she were the ""**Goddess of Water**,"" and no one had the right to drink water without her permission. She was so particular, with so much charm, affectation, and gestures, and she spoke as if she had known me for a thousand years. It was interesting that she even asked about my sister Mahshid and emphasized that I convey her special regards to my parents. At that moment, I had completely forgotten that Mahshid and I were twins, and that our resemblance was so striking that it had spread throughout the city, as if we were two apples eaten by a worm from the middle.

Finally, she said, ""Whenever you like, you can visit our gallery, and if you're interested, you can help us with the restoration and reconstruction of the saqqakhanehs in the Garden of Girls, because I know you have a knack for it. You are skilled in painting and sculpting, and especially, you possess a **'beautiful mind.'** After the restoration and reconstruction of the saqqakhanehs in the Garden of Girls, we are going to register both the Garden of Girls as an Iranian garden and the Chehel Menbar ceremony, which thousands of people from all over Iran and the world attend annually, with the Cultural Heritage Organization and UNESCO. A while ago, with the help of my mother, Mahshid, and the children of the gallery, we held an exhibition in the city called **'City of Angels.'** I'm surprised you don't know about this; I thought Ms. Mahshid would have told you. And don't forget, the water from this spring is also healing and from today onwards, you are immune to goiter because it is full of mineral salts, especially iodine. That's why they named it Araz water, or 'throat bulge.'""

In response, I said:

*Seek your desire against the norm,* *For I gained composure from that scattered lock.*

And then I asked, surprised, ""The Garden of Girls?! As far as I know, no boy is allowed to enter the Garden of Girls.""

She laughed and said nothing. I expected her to drink from the spring water with the cup, but suddenly she cupped her hand and drank a few sips from the spring water, as if she were a bird pecking at the water.

When she got up from the spring, she adjusted her navy blue scarf with Shahnameh text and paintings, and then tidied her coat. She wore a lime green coat that diffused the scent of lime into the air. It was a termeh design, patchwork filled with flowers, arabesques, medallions, and weeping cypresses, with a pond and turquoise tiles and beautiful red fish that made one want to pick the flowers from its garden or take a good dip in its pond.

With a special grace and a unique way of speaking, delivering words in broken, clipped phrases like a telegraph, she turned to me and said, ""You can come to the Garden of Girls on weekdays, but **only on Tasu'a and during the Chehel Menbar ceremony is the entry of boys forbidden**. So please, do not withhold your kindness towards us!""

I asked, ""What is the etymology of the Garden of Girls?""

She replied, ""There are various accounts, such as the existence of two sisters responsible for keeping the saqqakhanehs constantly lit, the Seven Flower-Adorning Sisters, forty girls who sought refuge in the garden from infidel jinn and suddenly all disappeared, a place for girls to play, and most importantly and authentically, that this garden was inherited by the owner's daughters after his death.""

It was very early morning, and the air was somewhat dark, with a thin, delightful mist covering everything. Green velvet moss covered the plane and ash trees of the street, and the reflection of the streetlights on the wet and rain-soaked asphalt and cobblestone sidewalks created a special scene, where everything was symmetrical in its reflection. In addition, the scent of plane tree pollen and the smell of raindrops perfumed the air, and with their watercolor magic, they colored the cobblestones. The plane tree pollen acted both as a broken perfume bottle and as color tablets, and the raindrops and spring water played the role of a solvent.

Perhaps you might think all these things I'm saying were just a dream, but believe me, they are the absolute truth, whether it's the place, the time, or the characters I encountered. Only at times did I feel like I was experiencing double vision, so disturbed was my sleep and wakefulness.

Then my attention was drawn to a ""6 Degrees"" brand bag, which had heavily adorned itself, transforming into the shape and likeness of Chinese idols, reminding one of **Humayun**, the Chinese princess. It captivated me as if I were **Humay**, the Iranian prince. A few words exchanged with Anahita seemed amusing, and it was as if she was speaking in Khujandi or Khatni Persian.

* The Flashcard Avalanche: When your desk looks like a paper tornado hit it.

Shoutout to everyone using resources like [ExamsHut’s study guides](https://examshut.com/) or any other tools to power through. You’re out here memorizing, practicing, and pushing past the stress to chase your goals—whether it’s becoming a nurse, cloud pro, or anything else. That’s no small feat!

1l875b3,https://i.redd.it/zm5tr1nea56f1.jpeg,Twin Peaks: the Return: the DECODE episode 4,"[www.PostRelevant.com](http://www.PostRelevant.com)

It finally happened.  The illuminated savior of the 21st hath arrived.  Sonny Jim... is back in.

Twin Peaks mavens!  Ahoy!  I hear that slice of coffee-flavored pie you love is coming back into style...

I've been with Twin Peaks since the very beginning (I am gen x aka old), and it has always been my central touchstone with the work of David Lynch.  But in 2017, when I heard TP: The Return was coming, I knew my particular brand of Twin Peaks was about to manifest in a stream of black smoke from the electrical outlet in my living room.  And it did!  And I freakin loved it.   Maybe my favorite TV show ever?  Maybe...

Cut to 2024, my buddy had been spending time in the Black Hills of South Dakota and found his way back to Twin Peaks.  He called me and said he wanted to watch the Return for the first time with me and talk about it. I told him I'd do him one better -- let's watch it and record a podcast where we DECODE the entire season! He agreed....

My name is Phil. I am the creator of the Post Relevant Podcast. Season 3 of my show is attempting to decode Twin Peaks: the Return. My cohost Justin and I go pretty deep, sifting through the series episode by episode, scene by scene, often line by line. We use the text and the visuals to try to decipher exactly what Lynch and Frost are presenting in this amazing story - in my opinion, Lynch's magnum opus. This is a promo for episode 4 of the podcast, which is decoding episode 4 of the Return. Its online now!

Please note, this is a creative endeavor - I am an actor/artist/musician/writer, etc, and I put together this show with lots of love in the creative spirit of David Lynch, using sound collage, a musical score, absurdist conversations and little bits of nonsense to illustrate the larger objective of decoding Twin Peaks: the Return. Its not your typical podcast - often there's lots of weirdness and experimentation before we get to the actual decode. So be prepared! If you aren't into hearing something you've never heard before, this might not be the show for you. If you like surprises, please check it out!

Episode 4 also features the debut of the jam-of-the-pre-summer-summer-jam, a brand new banger to honor our savior, a song for the offspring of Dougie Jones and Janey-E, ""Sonny Jim (Is Back In).""  I think it slaps, but who knows, maybe you'd just want to slap me after hearing it?  Only one way to find out...

I hope this message lights a backwards slow-motion flame of curiosity in your mind, and then, I hope you will check out the Post Relevant Podcast: Twin Peaks: the Return: the DECODE episode 4, now online!

1l8726d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1l8726d/manifestation_works_kinda_spooked/,Manifestation works? (kinda spooked),"Ok, so not sure if this is a vent or a success story but I just found my old journal where I did a few attempts at manifesting and oh boy.. things turned out JUST as described, I'm kinda spooked.

So for context, I like to think of myself as a rational person and while I want to believe in manifestation, I can't say I'm 100% sold. 

When I was a kid, my mom was often telling me about the Universe, that I could ask for things and the Universe would deliver. I didn't quite believe in that but there were cases when I kind of did. Like for example there were some very important school and university exams and even though I was worried at the time, deep down I KNEW I'll pass/get accepted. Like I could see it and so I knew I shouldn't worry. There was also a concert I really wanted to go to, but my family would never allow that. So I participated in a local radio giveaway again visualising I'd win and I did win a ticket and get to go. I had almost forgotten about these until now.

So about 5-6 years ago I moved to a new country after a serious breakup. Covid hit, I was already miserable and didn't have much to lose so I gave manifesting a try. I picked a pretty notebook and wrote:
- 1) one page on being grateful for meeting a wonderful person (I had met them already), enjoying my morning coffee on a nice balcony and having received a raise from my boss (mentioned by name)
- 2) one paragraph on being grateful for having a salary of 35K
- 3) about a year later, a similar page being grateful for everything and a salary of 45K, which mind you sounded impossible at the time 
- 4) another year later, a similar page with more focus on my work and getting a specific salary. I remember thinking I should write something super unachievable here and I had 90K in mind. 

This was 3 years ago, I haven't opened this notebook since then. The few times that I thought about it, I thought ""well, I wrote 90K and nothing happened.. I guess it's not working after all"" and so I didn't bother anymore.

Color me shocked when I finally opened my notebook today and what I actually wrote was 75K. It's just a little over what I make right now 🤯 Not going to reveal my background but these are CRAZY amounts for me, I've never even thought I could realistically have 1/3 of that. 

And that's not all. I had to double check the dates on the other salaries, they were all written about 1 year before I ACTUALLY got that or a very similar amount (32K and 45K respectively). I am also still with that person I was grateful for, and a lot of the descriptions of our place also fit - calm, green, with sea views. Also that boss I mentioned is now at my current company, even though we both changed jobs. They are no longer my manager but we talk from time to time and I wonder if mentioning them specificially by name kinda brought them back. This is insane. I got chills and I am very spooked. So naturally I just wrote my next page now. And I just felt I had to share.

And yet a part of me still doubts, is this actually manifesting or is it a normal career progression that I'm foolishly taking for ""magic""? Anyone ever had those doubts? It really feels surreal how each page in that notebook led me to where I am today. Any advice on accepting manifestation or taking it a step further is very welcome. Thank you if you read this far and may your manifesting journey bring you those same chills 💙 ",2,1749581732.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

I need suggestions for our routine for the summer, as our rec center halts all toddler programs for the season. My little starts preschool in September, she's not in daycare nor do we have outside help. 

Currently, I wake up around 5/6am, drink coffee, water my plants, feed the dog and let him out to pee.

Daughter gets up around 630/7, I get her breakfast, then we go out for a walk with the dog ~ 1hr. 

We come home, I tidy/ clean the house for roughly an hour. 

Then it's only 930/10am. I try to keep it low key until lunch. Then it's super hot outside. I've been twiddling my thumbs between 1030-4...

Evenings we make dinner at 4ish, eat at 5/530, then go on a ""fart walk"" after dinner. 

I don't have errands to run every day as I meal prep (which fills one afternoon a week), no need to go to the post office all the time, and we're in a relatively rural area with high tourism. My daughter doesn't like the park when other people are there, and I think she's also just on park burn out (screams ""nooooo"" when we get there and won't get out of the car.) There's a pool, but she's not interested. We try to beebop around the woods when we need to get out, and she has her own little garden area i let her go off in.  She does well with independent play, but my lack of ideas are starting to drive be nuts.

A DLC where you build giant factories to terraform a barren planet 🪐 and make it habitable 🌍. So Satisfactory meets Planet Crafter.

**Long story**

There's this game in development called Eden Crafters... It's a planet terraforming game where you build and automate factories to make a planet livable.

The concept is great, but I doubt it’ll match the depth or polish of Satisfactory, especially given how much work went into it. Still, Coffee Stain seems well-positioned to do a DLC like this. It probably wouldn't need the full dev team. World-building would take effort, but the other systems largely stay the same.

Planet Crafter is such a fun game, but it feels a bit lacking that you plot this building -> wait 5 mins -> you get a blue sky. I think it's missing the scale and depth of Satisfactory.

Now after like no messages or calls from last 10 days I thought it was finally over and I was relieved but on 5th May my paternal Grandfather expired but she kept on calling me from unknown numbers and threatened me that she’ll die so I called her boyfriend and told him everything she said then he told me that she asked him to become or act like me or some bullshit so he took her on conference and told her that he will tell her parents about their relationship so I guess she got scared and begged and cried on call so that he may not come at her home so both of them they set up a meeting on the next day to clear things up between them I think, coincidentally I was at the same place with my cousins and saw them but she didn’t see me as I was in a car. She brought a friend with her and the guy came alone and they were laughing and drinking cold coffee and talking so I thought they were back together and it was sorted. But since yesterday her blocked number popped up on top of my recent chats lists on whatsapp and upon searching the web I found out a blocked contact will pop up on top if the other person tried to send a message recently, then now 15 minutes ago her other friend sent a follow request to me on instagram I’m scared because I didn’t want the cycle to repeat I am tired of telling her that I am not interested in having any friendship or relationship with her. I haven’t even talked to her in person since 20th February that was the last day of our coaching. 

What should I do? Despite telling her multiple times that I am not interested she’s just not letting me go I don’t want her she’s got into my head now and not in a good way. What if she told her parents about me? She even gave me suicide threats and lied multiple times about her boyfriend and illness

I recently moved to Alberta from Nova Scotia for work (wind turbines) and am currently living out in Strathmore. The move has been a big change, and while I’m enjoying exploring the area, it’s been a bit tough to meet people. I’m 28, male, and living here on my own. All of my coworkers don’t speak much English, so it’s been kind of isolating at times.

I’m into a mix of things, sports (watching or playing), getting outdoors, video games, movies, festivals, honestly game for whatever lol. I'd really like to meet some people to hang out with, whether it's checking out cool spots around the province, going for hikes, grabbing a coffee or beer, or just chilling and chatting.

If you're also new to the area or just looking to make a new friend, feel free to message me. It’d be great to connect with some people.

Thanks for reading, and hope to chat soon!",13,1749581459.0,Calgary,5,0.81,False
1l86xpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1l86xpr/the_deer_i_buried_keeps_coming_back_dirtier_each/,The Deer I Buried Keeps Coming Back. Dirtier Each Time.,"I shot the buck just after dusk beneath a stand of ash trees mottled with rot. The sound of the rifle cracked through the quiet in that empty stretch of forest, and for a second, everything stilled. Then, the insects resumed.

It wasn’t sport. It never was. The thing limped when it moved- back leg swollen at the knee, left antler split and jagged at the base, eyes already clouding. From fifty feet away, I could smell the sickness. I’ve worked enough control jobs to know the signs of Chronic Wasting Disease, CWD for short before the field test confirms it. Wasting is slow. It hollows them out from the inside. Leaves them standing in creeks with their mouths open, drinking nothing. The state’s mandate was clear: any deer with visible symptoms was to be put down and reported.

I approached with gloves on, took the usual postmortem photos, and recorded the GPS coordinates. Marked the tag number- R-7769, clipped beneath the skin fold near the right shoulder. Standard insert, deep enough that scavengers wouldn’t reach it easily. The retrieval team was scheduled to arrive by morning to haul the body in for testing and disposal.

I stayed long enough to watch the flies settle. Then, I hiked back through the thinning trees and drove to the ranger’s lot, where I kept my temporary logbook. Entry made. Time recorded. Another task finished.

The next morning, I got the call.

“Nothing there,” the guy said through a crackling line. “Some bones, scattered. No hide, no carcass.”

I told him I’d bagged it clean. Tagged it myself. Gave the coordinates again.

“Must’ve been coyotes. Or a bear. You know how quick they are this time of year.”

I knew. I also knew what was normal and what wasn’t. Predators don’t clean up after themselves. There was no fur left. No drag marks. No prints in the soft soil around the site.

They logged it as unrecovered. Told me not to worry. These things happen. Still, I wrote a second entry in my personal field notes, separate from the agency forms.

Male. Estimate 5 years. Left antler fracture. Swollen rear joint. Tracking tag R-7769 confirmed. No retrieval. Carcass missing.

It wasn’t the first time something went off-script out here, but this one wouldn’t leave me. Something about the way it looked just before I pulled the trigger. Not startled. Not wild-eyed. Just still.

Later that evening, while transferring photos for filing, I noticed the last one in the series. A frame taken just before I shouldered the rifle. The buck standing there angled toward me, head tilted.

It almost looked like it was waiting.

\-

I wasn’t even thinking about it when it showed up again.

It was nearly midnight when I sat down with the trail cam footage. We rotate through the drives every few days- set up motion-triggered cams across the perimeter to catch anything sick or staggering through the zone after hours. The forest goes dead quiet at night, but that’s when the worst ones move. The late-stage wanderers. The ones the disease has already hollowed out.

That was my part of the job. Track sick deer and cull the population to reduce the spread. We had an on-site lab working on possible treatments at the same time.

I clicked through without much focus, just background noise, while I compiled sample logs. One camera had flagged motion across a ravine three nights prior. The footage was grainy, black and white, timestamped just after 1:00 AM. A deer crossed from right to left, angling downhill through a dried creek bed. Limber but slow. I paused on the third frame. Something about the shape caught me.

I zoomed in. Rear leg slightly raised. The joint bulged. Front left antler crooked backward at the base. Not broken off, but warped, like the core had splintered.

I already knew what I was looking at before the shape got closer to the camera. There was a faint glint behind the shoulder. One of our tracking tags, iridescent under infrared. Positioned exactly where I had inserted R-7769.

It was the same buck. The one I shot. No mistake. Same wound. Same tag. Same stance.

I leaned forward, rewound, and let it play again.

But this time, I noticed something else. The gait was wrong. The rear leg didn’t drag in the twitchy, spasmodic way late-stage CWD sufferers usually moved. It swung. Smooth. Unbroken. Too clean. There was no tension in the neck, either. The head stayed level, even as it walked uneven terrain. It was as if something else was moving the limbs, but not from within.

No bobbing. No tension through the spine. It was as if the body was being pulled forward in segments. Carried, not powered.

I went cold.

I checked the GPS location embedded in the file. It was within a quarter mile of the same stand of ash where I’d shot it days ago. It has the same elevation and the same forest density. I cross-referenced the tree formations behind the figure- thin lines of leafless branches, a birch with a split trunk, and matched them to my phone photos from the culling site.

Too close. Too precise. There’s a coincidence, and then there’s this.

Which meant either the shot had missed somehow, or something else was walking around in the deer’s skin.

I didn’t sleep much that night. I lay on my cot with my laptop screen still open, paused on the frame of that buck standing still in the ravine. Head low. Limbs straight. Eyes barely catching the light.

It was facing the camera.

\-

The footage kept coming.

Each morning brought a new flagged clip. Each time, the same buck. Same shattered antler and the same crooked back leg. Always alone, always after midnight, always brushing the edge of the camera’s infrared beam as if it knew just how much it could show without being caught full-on.

At first, I thought I was looking for patterns out of paranoia. But by the third night, I started marking the appearances on a field map. The dots were scattered at first, too scattered to mean much. But on the fifth entry, I saw it.

It was moving in a slow arc.

Not a wandering loop, not a lost or disoriented pattern. There was structure to it. The deer was following a wide perimeter path around the zone. Not random, not frantic. Steady. Predictable. As if it was circling something. Or someone.

I checked each camera’s placement again, laid out the route, and drew the circle. It wasn’t perfect, but it was closing in. The last three appearances had all been a little tighter. I followed the progression and placed a pushpin at the rough center.

It was us. The base camp trailer.

Which meant either this thing was tracking me or retracing the path of its own death. Maybe both.

I packed a small kit and headed out at first light, telling the team I was following a trail report. That wasn’t unusual- I’d done solo follow-ups before, and no one questioned it. I hiked about forty minutes to reach the spot where I’d put the buck down.

The ash trees were still there. Same slope. Same wind-carved patch of dead earth where the undergrowth had never fully returned after the fires a few years back. But there was no blood. No drag marks. Not even a disturbed pile of leaves.

What I found instead was a shallow depression in the dirt, ringed with brush and sticks. Not a scrape, not a bedding spot. Something had arranged the space intentionally. In the center, a crude pile of gathered debris- small bones, some snapped bird feathers, the twisted remains of something that looked like a jaw.

It was almost organized. It had a rough symmetry, though not in any way a deer should be capable of. They don’t build. They don’t nest. They don’t collect.

Which meant it wasn’t acting on instinct.

Something in it, whatever was walking that body, was aware. Deliberate. Maybe even learning.

I took photos, sent them to my field laptop, and marked the area for follow-up. But I didn’t send the images to the department. Not yet. I wasn’t ready to explain why I was chasing a deer that should have been rotting under six inches of dirt.

When I packed up and turned to leave, I swore I heard something shift behind the tree line. Not the crash of a startled animal. Just a slow, deliberate shift of weight, as if something waited until I looked away.

I didn’t turn around.

I walked back to camp with the sense that whatever this thing was, it had built something. And it was only the beginning.

\-

It was nearly 3 AM when something hit the cabin wall.

Not a scratch or scrape. A thud. Heavy and direct. No follow-up. No scurry of retreating hooves. Just one single, deliberate impact.

The sound jolted me upright. I stayed frozen for a moment, ears straining. Then another noise came, much softer this time. A slight creak of the pine frame settling. Or something leaning into it.

I grabbed the laptop and flipped through the most recent footage. The cabin cam facing the entry showed nothing. Just the unmoving trail of crushed grass and the steel bear box. I clicked over to the rear feed, one I’d set up mostly to monitor raccoon activity.

That’s where I saw it.

Not up close. Not detailed. But enough.

The deer stood just within the infrared glow. Upright. Not on all fours.

Standing.

Its rear legs were locked at the joints, thin but rigid. The rest of the body sagged forward, front limbs dangling like dead weight. Its chest was bowed, the rib cage compressed. The head hung too far forward before slowly lifting, stiff and unsure.

It took one step. Then another. Every movement was strained, trembling with the effort to balance. It moved like a puppet strung by hands that had never seen a living thing.

But it kept its head up.

Even in the poor resolution, I could see it tracking the lens. Its face had changed. The snout was partly caved in, no longer a clean line of bone and fur. Skin slumped over one side, sagging down past the jaw. It looked heavier than before, swollen or softened. No glint of eyes. Just the hollows where they used to sit.

It didn’t graze. Didn’t sniff. Just stood there. Watching.

This wasn’t a scavenger wearing a carcass. It wasn’t instinct. It was tracking something.

Me.

I closed the laptop and went to the filing crate under the bunk. I dug out the original kill log, the handwritten one, but not the digital report I filed later. It had blood on the corner from the tagging knife, but everything else was clean. Coordinates. Time. Tag code. A quick field sketch.

And then I saw it.

Scrawled in the side margin, a faint pencil nearly rubbed away:

Burn after disposal.

I hadn’t noticed it. The retrieval crew had never shown. There was an instruction left by the lab team I had missed. 

Which meant whatever that thing was, whatever was walking around in the hollowed-out body of that deer, I had left it there. I had given it the time.

I grabbed the heavy lock from the gear chest and bolted the front door. Pushed a chair under the handle out of some useless instinct. It wouldn’t stop anything with real weight behind it, but it made me feel like I was doing something.

Outside, the wind had dropped. No forest movement. No insects ticking against the window glass. It felt like the woods had emptied out. Like the normal rules of wilderness had paused.

I didn’t sleep.

I sat in the corner with the camera feed open, staring at the second angle, waiting for it to return. But it never did. 

\-

Morning light bled through the closed curtains. The printout still sat on the counter, half-crumpled.

“Burn after disposal.”

I hadn’t shown it to anyone. Who would I tell? I just kept refreshing the trail cam app and waiting for another ping. Nothing yet.

My head was starting to hurt, probably from the stress. My sinuses felt swollen, and pressure was mounting. 

Still, I needed to see it again. Not through a screen. I needed something to confirm it was just a deer. Some rational explanation. Something my brain could pin down.

I hiked back to the clearing in the late afternoon with the same gear and the same boots. The air felt heavier out there- still, but watchful. I stepped carefully, scanning the brush around the old kill site. No body, of course. That was gone the first time.

But something else had been left behind.

Near a thicket, I found a patch of fur snagged along a thornbush- dark, coarse, unmistakable. A few feet beyond that, I spotted a smear of something darker on the flat side of a split rock. Looked dried and waxy. Not rot, exactly. Almost preserved.

I pulled a sample with tweezers, wrapped it in foil, and packed it for the walk back.

In my cabin, I set up my old field scope. It wasn’t high-end, barely better than a biology student’s training model, but it could still read enough at low magnification. I sliced a sliver from the waxy tissue and placed it on a slide with a saline drop.

The second I looked through the lens, I felt the back of my neck go cold.

There were seams. Not cuts. Not scars. Seamlines- tiny, symmetrical striations crossing in a grid pattern just below the surface. The cells weren’t dried out either. They were alive. More than alive. They were organized. Pulsing faintly. Something was knitting them together as if the tissue had been rebuilt rather than preserved.

Which meant it hadn’t died the way I thought. Or if it had, it hadn’t stayed that way.

No deer tissue behaves like that, especially not after sitting exposed to weather and scavengers for days. It should’ve been dust by now.

I set up a quick test with what I had, some ammonia-based cleaner, and a few protein indicators. Crude, sure, but good enough for basic reactivity. I placed another tissue sliver in a shallow dish, added the cleaning agent, and watched.

The reaction was instant. Violent bubbling, a hiss of vapor, and a reek like scorched hair and formaldehyde. The tissue turned black, curling in on itself like it had nerves. The smell was chemical but sharp enough to sting behind my eyes.

I rinsed the dish and flushed the sample. My hands were shaking, but I couldn’t stop thinking. I couldn’t stop asking myself what regenerative mechanism could survive that reaction. What kind of biology could fake life that cleanly?

I searched for anything similar- fungal colonies, synthetic grafts, parasitic worms that repurpose host tissue. But nothing matched.

By nightfall, I was just staring at the wall, mind blank. The camera feed pinged.

I tapped open the app. The clearing cam had triggered.

There it was again.

The deer stood at the treeline. Just standing. But something was different this time. I had to squint to see it, but I couldn’t unsee it once I noticed it.

The left foreleg was gone. Not chewed or torn. Just missing. The skin along the shoulder was smooth, pale under the moonlight, stretched tight like clay. But the thing didn’t limp. It stood evenly, shifting its weight like the limb had never been there at all.

I zoomed in further, as much as the grainy frame allowed.

The deer turned toward the camera. I froze. The neck didn’t turn smoothly. It cracked sideways, fast and unnatural, the rest of the body remaining still. A snap in the joint, or somewhere deeper. But it didn’t recoil. Didn’t blink. It just stared directly at the lens.

And for a moment, I had the horrible impression it saw me. Not the camera. Me.

Then, it walked off-screen. Not limping. Not struggling.

Just... walking. Purposefully.

I shut the app and sat there until sunrise.

No new alerts came in that night.

\-

I stopped sleeping more than an hour at a time. The headaches were worse now. Full pressure behind the eyes, like something swelling beneath my skull. My nose wouldn’t stop bleeding that morning; it was just a thin trickle that ran whenever I tilted forward. I couldn’t hold food. Couldn’t hold a thought.

I told work I was sick. I didn’t go in. I didn’t tell them why. I just wanted to be alone, to figure it out. To run the test again.

I kept telling myself this was Chronic Wasting Disease. I had studied it, after all. That’s why we were here. But this didn’t match the spread pattern. No drooping ears, no emaciation. And the regeneration didn’t make sense. The movement. The fact that it stood.

I pulled up the trail cam archive.

A new ping two nights ago. Camera 12. The farthest one, facing the southern edge where the old logging road ends.

At first, I thought it was a poacher. Human shape. Movement slow, head tilted too far down. But the figure was shirtless, stumbling, with hands twitching at his sides. Knees stiff. 

Then he turned slightly toward the lens.

And I froze. I recognized him.

Not the face. The posture. The build. The way one shoulder hunched slightly from an old break. It was Nathan. One of the seasonal hires who helped with retrieval and site cleanup. He hadn’t shown up to the base in over a week. 

New angle. Camera 13. Same clearing. Thirty seconds long.

The deer came through first, from the left. Limping, dragging one hind leg. Then it stopped. Just stood there. Seconds later, the man entered from the opposite side. Crawling. Hands and feet in the dirt. He stopped a few feet from the deer.

Neither reacted.

There was no fear. No sound. They simply coexisted. Standing and swaying in the same poisoned wind.

That was the last clip. No new alerts came after that.

I closed the app.

I sat there for hours, waiting for another ping. The room was still, but I couldn’t hear birds anymore. No buzz of summer insects outside the cabin. Even the trees looked off. The underbrush is too low. Too quiet.

I checked my nose. Another streak of blood on the back of my hand. I hadn’t even felt it.

I felt woozy, so I lay down and passed out.

\-

The final trail cam clip was still frozen on-screen when I woke. 

I shut the laptop. My nose had started bleeding again, slow and steady, tracing a warm smear down past my upper lip. I wiped it with the sleeve of my hoodie, staring at the wall for a moment as my breath came in shallow pulls.

The air felt too heavy. Or maybe my lungs were slowing down.

I tried calling Nathan, the assistant I thought I had seen in the footage. The call rang twice, then cut to voicemail. 

The backup tablet still had access to the DNR field office network. I logged in and pulled the remote tracker logs. No check-ins for thirty-six hours. Not from the monitoring team, field counters, or even the auto-flagged deer cams. Nothing.

I pinged the emergency contacts. All three admin names came up offline.

In the bathroom mirror, I didn’t look right.

The skin under my eyes was drawn and waxy, my face pale in a way that light couldn’t explain. A red burst had crept into the white of my left eye, capillaries bloomed outward like roots. When I pressed a knuckle to my cheekbone, the pressure dulled slowly, without edge.

I didn’t need a blood panel to confirm it. Whatever was in the deer, whatever had kept it moving, was in me now, too.

And if I was infected, it meant I was on a timer.

I didn’t bother calling the office again. I didn’t report symptoms. There wasn’t anyone left to explain it to. If I waited for help, I’d be a walking corpse before anyone arrived.

I packed fast. Cold packs, the preserved sample, trail notes, ammonia strips, and field accelerants. Every drive that had footage. A USB with basic microscope imaging software. Enough canned food to last a few days if I needed them.

The wind outside had gone still. The cabin didn’t creak. No bird calls. No insects. Just the low hum of trees remembering their weight.

The main lab was seventy miles north- DNR-affiliated but independent. It had a backup generator, cold storage, and a sterilization hood. If I could get there before my symptoms worsened, maybe I could finish what I started. Trace the spread. Burn out whatever had learned to wear skin.

I locked the cabin door behind me. One last glance at the tree line. Nothing moved.

But the silence felt... aware.

I got in the truck, started the engine, and drove without checking the rearview.

If I didn’t make it in time, no one would.

\-

I reached the lab just past dusk. The trees pressed in tight along the road, branches clawing at the truck as I rolled up the gravel path. No signs of field biologists or late shifts. Just the wind and the low hum of the backup generator struggling to keep rhythm.

The front doors were unlocked.

Inside, the overhead fluorescents flickered behind stained plastic covers. A couple bulbs buzzed in their sockets, casting long, uneven shadows across the tiled floor. The air smelled faintly of bleach and something else, something deeper. Damp, iron-sweet.

No voices greeted me. No motion. Just the slow, steady beep of a security door stuck half-ajar in the back hallway.

The reception desk was abandoned. A mug of coffee still steamed faintly, the rim stained with a half-finished sip. A pair of reading glasses sat beside it, folded neatly as if someone meant to return.

They hadn’t.

I moved deeper into the facility. The surveillance room was unlocked, which wasn’t protocol. The wall of monitors stuttered with looping footage from around the building: front gate, access hall, generator room, exterior trails.

One feed caught my attention, a shape crouched in the treeline behind the lab. Not human. Broad-shouldered, hunched, unmoving. Another monitor showed a figure walking shirtless down the staff hallway. Bare feet. Pale skin. He was dragging something behind him, a metal pole clattering against the tile.

There wasn’t a patient wing in this building. No beds. No IV stands. But I knew what I saw.

I killed the feeds. No need to watch more than I had to.

The freezer lab was worse.

The door stood open a few inches, cold air spilling out. Inside, the stainless steel racks were half-empty. Trays overturned, vials cracked across the floor in a fine glitter of broken glass and thawed residue. The walls glistened with condensation, fingerprints smeared into the frost.

I found a catalogue of samples. Similar to the ones I had collected myself. Had they been working on this the whole time? If so, to what end?

I checked the surrounding shelves for any signs of tampering. One broken vial had spilled down the side of the unit. The trail stopped at the floor but didn’t pool. Instead, it split, streaks drawn outward by something moving low and slow.

That’s when I saw the prints.

Not boot treads. Hoof prints. But not natural ones. Each was split, yes, but too long. Too narrow. The pressure pattern was wrong, centered toward the toe, as if whatever made them had been balancing, creeping.

They led away from the freezer. Across the lab floor. Right to the wall vent.

I stepped closer. The cover was off. Bent at the corners. Inside, the duct was streaked dark. A few long strands of fur clung to the inner rim. Not deer fur. Something coarser. Almost wire-like.

Something had already been here before me. Or someone let it in.

I stood there a moment, listening.

Somewhere in the back wing, something metal scraped across tile.

Then nothing.

I closed the freezer and sealed the remaining sample in my personal cold case. My hands were shaking as I locked the lab door behind me.

And now I wasn’t sure who, or what had ever been running this place.

\-

By morning, my hands were shaking. It started small, just the fingers, but I couldn’t get a cap off a vial without fumbling. My vision kept slipping out of focus, not constantly, just in rhythmic flickers. In the mirror above the lab sink, I watched my pupils expand and shrink back and forth like they couldn’t decide what they were supposed to do.

My gums had started to ache.

I tore a sheet from the back of an abandoned chart and pinned it to my jacket:

‘IF I LOSE SPEECH, BURN THE BODY. DO NOT TOUCH THE SKIN.’

Then, I made for the biology wing.

Only the emergency lights were working in this part of the lab, casting dim, jittering gold across the tiles. The carts were overturned. Papers had been scattered, trampled, or soaked through from a broken pipe in the ceiling. Breath fogged in the air. It was cold.

I pulled a logbook from the wreckage of a desk. Most of the pages were useless- notes about wildlife counts, nutrition breakdowns, half-finished hypotheses. I flipped to the back. There, wedged between two damp pages, was a loose sheet of paper with sharp handwriting:

“Secondary hosts showed accelerated symptoms after exposure to decomposing infected tissue. Delayed infection correlated with chemical disruption- ammonia and alcohol treatments.”

I stopped.

My symptoms started after handling the sample. But, I had stumbled on using ammonia while doing rudimentary tests. Whatever concoction I had accidentally breathed in hadn’t cured me, but had delayed what happened to the seasonal hire I saw skulking with the deer. 

It bought me time. A buffer.

The others? They worked under protocol. Sterile, precise. Direct exposure.

I folded the note and slipped it into my jacket.

There wasn’t a cure. But at least now I understood why I was still walking. And this inspired my makeshift idea. 

I found one last working autoclave near the end of the wing. It rumbled to life when I keyed in the override. I scraped together everything I could- what remained of the preserved tissue, anything I’d touched, old gloves, even the container, and loaded it all into the chamber.

The inside was coated with black residue. Not mold. Something else. Maybe someone had already tried this.

I set the burn, locked the latch, and stepped away before the heating cycle could even start.

My legs were slower now. Not numb. Just heavy. Every step felt delayed, like the signals were moving through sludge. I touched the glass in the hallway. I couldn’t feel it. Couldn’t feel the chill against my fingers.

I left through the back.

The woods were still. Grey. The clouds hung low over the canopy, and somewhere behind me, the lab hissed with steam. I didn’t know if the sterilization would do anything. Didn’t know if it was too late.

But I had one more thing to do.

I packed everything I needed and worked on the move.

Not a cure. Just a final step. And I started walking toward where it all began.

\-

I didn’t follow the trail cam routes this time.

The clearing where I shot the buck. Where the carcass vanished. Where I should have burned it.

I carried everything with me in my pack. An improvised cocktail, cleaning ammonia and accelerants. I cobbled together materials for a makeshift device- powdered rust scraped from the back hinges of old equipment and aluminum shavings pulled from trail signs. It wasn’t a perfect thermite mix, but it would ignite. Enough to burn tissue. Enough to destroy whatever was rewriting it.

The walk was longer than I remembered. Or maybe I was slower. My joints ached. My fingers tingled. The fever behind my eyes pulsed in waves, clouding the corners of my vision. But I was still thinking clearly. I could still make decisions. That meant I still had time.

I used this time to make improvised devices. Crude but functional.

The trees changed before the path did. At first, I thought it was just fog settling through the branches. But the bark had a sheen. Not wet, waxed. A fine spread of pale threads ran between the trunks, and when I brushed past one, it stuck to my jacket.

I reached the clearing. It wasn’t a nest anymore.

It had bloomed.

The glade was a full sprawl of organic spires, sinew, and fungal bloom. Long veinous threads ran between trees and into the undergrowth. The dirt looked bruised. There were thick nodules the size of fists half-buried in the soil, throbbing. Fungal stalks had grown into warped, ribbed structures, almost like cages, but I couldn’t tell if they were meant to keep something in or out.

The smell was worse than any rot I’d encountered. A mix of iron, fermentation, and something vaguely sweet, like ripe fruit gone sour.

The wildlife was gone. No birds. No insects. But around the perimeter, the ground was littered with corpses. Rodents. A raccoon. Something small and canine, maybe a fox.

Some of them were twitching.

Not breathing. Spasming. As if their bodies hadn’t caught up with the fact they were already dead. One of them, a rabbit, jerked its head upward, jaw twitching open. A sound came out. Not a breath. A click. Maybe an attempt at speech. I didn’t stay close enough to listen.

This was what it had been doing. Not hunting. Cultivating. It was rewriting the instructions that told muscle and bone how to be.

In the center of the glade was a mound.

Flesh, hair, antler. Segments of deer skull fused with what looked like vertebrae. Human ribs. Tangled legs, some still clothed in remnants of field pants. A name patch peeked out, half-fused into the tissue. I didn’t go closer to read it. I already knew.

I dropped to my knees. Opened my pack. Began assembling the ammonia. The heat was rising in me now, internal, pressing. I was sweating hard. My tongue was thick in my mouth. The ammonia stung my nose, but I needed it. I poured carefully, trying to keep my hands steady. Just a few minutes. Just one successful ignition.

I heard the footsteps before I saw them.

Not hooves. Not claws. Feet.

I turned slowly, the thermite charge half-assembled in my lap. Three figures stepped out from the edge of the nest. People. Or what it used to be.

My field team. Harris, from my old lab rotation. Jenna, the intern who logged samples. And one of the rangers I used to check in with on morning rounds.

Their skin looked spongey, waterlogged, and blotched with grey patches that pulsed beneath the surface. Their veins ran black and branched across their arms and necks. All three of them stared at me through clouded white eyes, lips parted in slow, shallow breaths that didn’t sound like breathing at all.

They weren’t charging. They didn’t groan or howl. They just... stepped forward, their arms stiff, their heads tilting, and their mouths slack. Like they were still trying to remember how movement worked.

To them, I just looked like another infected, returning to the hive.

I took a shaky breath. Raised a hand without meaning to. “I’m sorry,” I said.

For a second, something flickered behind Harris’s eyes. A twitch in the cheek. His jaw shifted. I saw his lips try to form a word, but all that came out was a wet rasp, a throat too soft to carry sound. There was still sympathy, a glimmer of humanity that was rapidly fading.

Then came the deer. They had no such feelings.

They emerged slowly, deliberately, and confident from the trees behind the team. The upright one leaned forward with each step, spine trembling with effort, but its limbs moved cleanly now. Behind it crawled another, shoulder twisted, dragging its weight along a patch of exposed roots. The last one moved worst of all. It dragged a fused limb that wasn’t fully deer- part bone, part human muscle, strung together with the wrong tension.

They made no noise. Their heads cocked with a mechanical curiosity. All eyes locked on me. And they saw what I was doing.

A huff puffed out from their nostrils as they readied to charge. Hooves bracing to sprint.

My hands shook as I reached for the striker. The first scrape gave nothing. The second sparked. On the third, it caught.

I lit the smallest flask of ammonia and hurled it at the edge of the nest. It hissed on contact. The fungal web sizzled, the black veiny threads pulling back from the chemical burn like they were alive.

That did it. The reanimated abominations stumbled forward- not toward me, but toward the patch I’d hit. Twitching. Compelled. Pain? Instinct? Rage? I couldn’t tell.

But it told me something important. They had a choice. They didn’t lunge at me. Not yet. They went for the fire.

I didn’t give them time to rethink it.

I lit the thermite and hurled it toward the center of the nest.

The flash was instant and vicious. A column of heat tore through the fungal bed, charring it in a heartbeat. A few deer were caught in the process. The smell made my vision swim- something between spoiled meat and plastic insulation.

Instinct kicked in, and my old crew sprang into action, rushing to save their colony. 

The mound in the center shrieked, not with sound but with pressure. A thick, static hum filled the air. My eyes pulsed. My ears rang.

Harris screamed. Not a human sound. Just a rupture of voice. He collapsed mid-step. Jenna followed, limbs still jerking on the ground like fish on a dock.

The upright deer tried to flee but collapsed as soon as their connection severed.

I lit the final charge, the biggest one, and rolled it into the heart of the nest.

It ignited on contact. The second explosion was worse than the first. Trees caught. Flame raced up the stalks. The sinew network snapped and curled in on itself. A line of fungus tried to retreat down into the roots, but the fire chased it.

But most importantly, all the bodies caught flame, destroying any remnants of this horror.

I stumbled back, coughing into my sleeve. My vision smeared. One eye darkened. I wiped at it, but my hand came back red. Blood.

The glade thrashed like a body in seizure. Then it went still.

I stood there until the flames reached the ridge. Until the entire bloom turned black and brittle. Until the heat burned the smell away.

Only then did I turn. And walk. Burned, sick, bleeding from both eyes, but lighter than I’d felt in weeks.

Because I’d done something real. Because I’d ended it. Or at least made sure it wouldn’t spread any farther.

And if I was wrong, if something crawled out later, I wouldn’t be here to see it.

\-

I sat slumped in the truck, throat raw, eyes blurred. My fingers barely worked. They kept slipping on the recorder’s button before I finally managed to press it down.

“Sample sterilized. The source nest burned. Secondary host transmission confirmed.”

My voice didn’t sound like mine anymore. I waited for a moment, letting the silence settle before speaking again.

“My name is Elias Ward. Field ID 72601-B. Contracted wildlife biologist, state assigned. I acted alone. I have destroyed all known infected samples. The growth site has been neutralized. There are no survivors.”

I paused. Listened. Nothing but the low wind through the ridge. No movement in the trees. No footsteps in the brush.

“If anyone finds this log, do not come looking for survivors. There is nothing left here worth recovering.”

I clicked the recorder off and let it drop into my lap. My head rested against the window. The cold glass felt steady, almost grounding. The woods outside were still. Choked in ash and fog.

I took the cassette and sealed it in a weatherproof specimen case. Marked it clearly. Left it outside near the truck, but not too close. If anyone did find this place, they’d find the truth first.

Then I sat back inside and looked at the keys in my palm.

I lied. I hadn’t destroyed all traces. There was still one left.

Me.

But that would be dealt with shortly.

The thermite was rigged, crude, but functional. Set beneath the seat, tied to the ignition. I had checked the fuse three times earlier before my vision went. When the key turned, the reaction would start. Heat, metal, flame. Nothing left to spread.

I took a final breath. No last words. No dramatic farewell.

I’m deep in the thick of the sandwich generation—raising teens while caring full-time for my mom, who’s completely non-verbal and dependent after a stroke she had over a decade ago.

My kids are now in middle and high school, navigating friendships, anxiety, algebra, and social media. Meanwhile, I’m coordinating physical therapy, Medicaid redeterminations, incontinence supplies, and neurologist visits.

It’s been 16 years of this dual life—starting when my kids were babies. Now they’re older and more independent, but caregiving hasn’t let up. It’s just evolved.

Here’s what I’ve learned, especially living here in **New Jersey**:

🧠 **Humor is survival.**  
If I don’t laugh when the pharmacy delivers my mom’s meds to my neighbor’s house again, I’ll lose it. One time my teen asked, “Can grandma hear us blink?” I didn’t have an answer.

🌆 **New Jersey resources actually exist—use them.**  
Your county’s **ADRC (Aging & Disability Resource Connection)** is gold. They helped me get Medicaid through **MLTSS** even though my mom had a pension and Social Security.  
I also learned about the **Miller Trust**, which helps when income is too high to qualify but expenses are still overwhelming.

📓 **Respite care saves us.**  
We get 90 days a year in NJ, where Medicaid covers a temporary nursing home stay. My mom goes to a facility we both trust. I get a week to focus on my kids—or just breathe.

💪 **To my fellow Gen X / elder Millennials:**  
We’re not burned out because we’re weak. We’re burned out because we’re doing two full-time jobs that never clock out.  
One day it’s SAT prep and soccer, the next it’s wound care and hospice planning. Most days, it’s both.

This life is hard, layered, and invisible. If you’re in it, too — I see you. You’re doing incredible work. And if you’re in NJ and need help navigating the system, I’ll happily share the playbook I’ve built by trial, error, and panic googling.

A brief history of things. In 6th grade, I had a best friend, Maddy, and we would hang out often. She had a brother, Josh, only a year younger than us, so frequently he would hang out with us or the group too.  We were all quite close and they went through a lot of family adjustments as younger kids, which made us even closer. I remained friends with Maddy through junior year (11th grade), but with us focusing on sports/school and having differing friend groups now we didn’t see each other as much. The three of us went to the same high school though, so Maddy and I still checked in every now and then.

Senior year (12th grade), I began hanging out with Maddy more again, which meant I would see Josh around more.. and he started talking to me at school regularly. Josh and I started dating soon after, and realized we had small periods of crushes on each other as children too. All that to say that the relationship was not super great, quite a bit of immaturity and naivety from being young, and we broke up 3/4 months in. It was not a good breakup, and there was also some bitterness on both sides from events that followed the breakup, that was never really resolved.

Today, I received a text from Josh. He is asking to meet sometime over coffee. That he’s not trying to do anything weird, he just wants to talk as friends, but he understands if I am uncomfortable with it. We have not talked or texted each other since our breakup 6 years ago, and I don’t really ask Maddy about Josh when I see her either.

I plan to tell my current boyfriend about the texts, but I’m not sure whether or not I should go. My thoughts are Josh and I were friends for much longer than we dated, I have zero want to be with him again, and he’s included that it’s alright for me not to go. I can’t lie, I certainly am curious. Really curious. But curiosity does not equal obligation, I know. I also feel like I might throw up thinking about seeing Josh again. Maybe I feel like I have to because I still have a friendship with Maddy. I have terrible anxiety so I’m not sure how to feel right now. Maybe I ask Maddy to be there? My current boyfriend? Or, maybe I just say no?

TL;DR Old childhood friend (and brief ex) reached out after 6 years of no contact asking to meet up to talk. I’m curious but also anxious, have a boyfriend now, and don’t know whether I should go or not.

I wonder if others feel the same.,"There are many people out there that feel like they need to be constantly busy and stimulated at work and that they would rather be crazy stressed out because it makes the day go by faster. 

I am not one of those people. I work as an IT systems administrator an and had my fair share of terrible jobs before I got here. I've worked in restaurants, I've worked in warehouses, I've worked in horrendously managed small computer companies in client-facing roles. Stressed out all the time, absolute hell on Earth while I was at work, I would spend my time off of work dreading having to go back to work. 

Now? I was able to work my way up into a pretty cushy role. I worked my ass off to get here and it took 8 years of grinding it out but we are finally in a position where most of our job as a department is simply monitoring for problems and fixing them where they come up. 

On any given day, I have maybe 2 or 3 hours of actual work to do and the rest of my time is going on walks, taking coffee breaks, bullshitting with my coworkers or browsing Reddit. It's boring but I'm making way more money than I ever thought I would and I love the fact that I'm getting paid more than I ever have to relax for most of the day. 

My team and I worked very hard to get ourselves to this position. A lot of automation, a lot of replacing unreliable solutions and technology now, A lot of grinding it out and long nights but I feel like I finally made it.

Hey Stern community! I've been accepted to transfer to Stern, Georgetown McDonough, and Brown for Fall 2025 (entering as a sophomore). I'm heavily leaning toward Stern given the NYC location and finance reputation, but want to make sure I understand what I'm signing up for.

My goal is breaking into elite IB/PE/HF (BB banks, top MM, or elite boutiques like Evercore, Centerview, etc.).

**Stern-specific questions:**

* How cutthroat is the internal competition? I've heard it can be pretty intense - is this overblown or accurate?
* Which finance clubs are worth targeting? I know about the Investment Banking Society, but what about Private Equity Club, Student Managed Fund, etc.?
* How's the recruiting process actually structured? Do firms just camp out at Stern or is there still heavy networking required?
* Any advantage to being in the city year-round for networking/coffee chats?

**Academic & Club Scene:**

* How hard is it to maintain a high GPA while doing all the finance extracurriculars?
* Which professors are most plugged into Wall Street? Any classes that are must-takes?
* What's the application process like for competitive clubs as a transfer student?
* Do the finance clubs actually help with recruiting or is it more about signaling?

**Recruiting Reality Check:**

* What percentage of Stern finance students actually land BB/EB roles vs. MM/boutiques?
* How does Stern's placement compare to other semi-targets? I know it's strong, but curious about the real numbers
* Is sophomore summer recruiting realistic, or should I focus on getting any finance experience first?
* What do successful students typically do to stand out in the recruiting process?

**Social/Culture:**

* How's the work-life balance? Can you have a social life while being competitive for top firms?
* Is Greek life important for finance networking, or is the professional club scene enough?
* What's the typical day/week like for someone serious about finance recruiting?

**NYC Specific:**

* How expensive is it really? I know NYC is pricey but wondering about the student experience
* Any advantages to being in the city for internships during the school year?
* How accessible are Wall Street professionals for informational interviews?

Really appreciate any insights, especially from current students or recent grads who went through recruiting. Want to make sure I'm being realistic about what it takes to succeed at Stern!

The day before the exam i was worried like a lot. I studied but you know how you always think it's not enough. So i decided to try and make a deal with a demon (yeah i know making a deal because of an exam). I wanted to find a suitable one so i searched a lot for one that suits my needs. i decided on Marbas because i study medicine he is a healer so yeah seems to fit a lot.  
I researched a lot on how to summon it (sigil, orange candles and everything needed). I read most people offer him coffee, but i am did it with tea (it worked for me so yeah).  
I prepared everything and after about 200 minutes there it was. I saw a lot of people describe him as lion-human hybrid, but to me he was just a lion. He didn't talk just stared at me at first. I thanked him for answering him and told him what i need- to help me stay calm during my exam. In return i told him i will share my story here, at first he didn't agree, but after some modulations on our deal (i needed to read all the material in one night) he agreed. I thanked him for his time and he dissapeared.  
After the ritual i did a simple card readinf (felt like it idk why) And in short, he was now waiting for me to finish my part of the deal (go over everything in one night). I started to read and it was acrually okay, i didn't feel tierd and managed to go over everything.  
I had some hours to sleep so i layed down and fell aslee in an instant (a rare thing for me) and had a dream i cleary remember (another weird thing for me). The dream was about me and a lion in the opposite side of an empty pond. He was holding a vase full of water and started drop by drop to fill the pond. When the pond was full the lion just vanished.  
In the morning i was super calm no worries or anything like that (which is rare for me since i am pretty emotional person). As i walked towards the building where the exam was about to be held i stopped by a cofe shop and bought some coffee. I didn't drink it i just thanked Marbas for the calmness and spilled in on the ground near a tree.  
As i walked in everyone was really worried (usually that affects me too), but i was still calm. I sat down and recived my test (the exam is test part and oral part) I passed the test with 24/30 and get ready for my oral questions. And here i got all of the questions i was worried about antibiotics and such (pretty har material imo), but as i started to talk i said what i know and the professor was like ""I am sorry, but..."" I asked for another question and suprisingly she allowed it. After i answer she started talking how she is very intuitive person, something about how she sees a lot of potential in me etc. Which is weird since it's the first time someone tells me such stuff during an exam.  
In the end i passed thanks to Marbas (a lot of stuff that didn's suppouse to be allowed happened, like the second question thing). I am new in this stuff, but i am glad i was able to work with him. He was nice and supportive, but also stern.",1,1749581049.0,u_Traditional-Cut8593,0,1.0,False

Worked on myself and tried to heal from the heartbreak and it is all good now (supposedly). I recently decided to try and date again as i have been single not trying to meet women and I got in contact with 25 F and 24 F. 

The 25F y.o I met on X (twitter) we touched base and she lived in another country. We flirted for 2-3 months on and off but the vibe was good and the chemistry was there (So i thought). She had her thesis defense and I sent her flowers and she was very happy with it and the flirting went on and on. After 2 weeks, today I have received a message after i was ghosted yesterday that ""even tho i was nothing but kind and supportive, she is still overwhelmed and she cannot continue on and that she doesn't have the capacity to be present in the way she should be"". After that i told her that i appreciate her honesty and i wish her well. After all this time we even made plans to visit each other and that she would be disappointed if i left her alone when she comes back home (we are from the same country). 

The 24F y.o I met on a dating app, the vibe was sweet and nice we opened up a lot and had so much shared interests. And we both have the same understanding of personal space, and our characters are sort of similar. Yesterday we agreed to meet for a coffee after 2 weeks of texting and so we did, the conversations were there she asked me about my previous relationships and so did I and the night went well (so i thought). In the morning i wake up to a text saying that ""she enjoyed meeting me and that i am very kind and respectful person but after reflection she can see me only as a friend and not as someone she would have a relationship with"" (and that after only one date). 

So here I am today asking myself these questions:
- What to do if 25 F comes back home since we agreed to meet up? 
- What changed in 4 years?

I wish I could tell this story to my friends and family, but of course, since they’re caffeine users and have never had any issues with it or after taking a break, there’s absolutely no chance they’d believe me. This is going to be a long one, so grab your popcorn and enjoy.

From a very young age, I realized I was sensitive to caffeine—especially energy drinks. When I was around 15 years old, I drank 2 cans of energy drinks on the same day, spaced a few hours apart. As I started drinking the second can, just a few minutes later I experienced a migraine with aura, a fainting sensation, dizziness, blurry vision, and the overwhelming feeling that I was going to die. I don’t remember how the next day went, but I do remember that the sense of terror was the worst I had ever felt—up to that point.

For the next few years, I completely cut out caffeine until I turned 17, when I would occasionally have an energy drink (usually on vacation). But I don’t remember having any reactions. After that, I started drinking coffee regularly for the next 3 years without a break. From November 2024 until mid-February 2025, I was consuming an excessive amount of caffeine. The reason? My performance at the gym. Training is my entire life, and I wanted to do everything I could to perform at my absolute best. Since my parents didn’t allow me to take pre-workout, I started on energy drinks at the beginning of January 2025. Before that, I was drinking 2 cups of filter coffee, but after a while that amount of caffeine wasn’t enough to give me a boost anymore.

So, I started drinking my usual coffee in the morning, and during my workout I would have a can of Monster. Everything was fine for the first two weeks. Then one day, out of nowhere, I began to feel an intense tightness in my chest after training. So intense, I genuinely thought I was going to die. That was when I had my first panic attack. The chest tightness continued for several days, but I kept consuming over 350 mg of caffeine per day because I had no idea that all of this was being caused by the energy drinks.

Later, more symptoms of overconsumption began to appear—such as dizziness and migraines with aura. Until mid-February, when I had another panic attack. I was convinced something was wrong with my heart. I went to a cardiologist and had a full blood panel done. Everything came back fine. Still, I kept ignoring the source of the problem. But despite not understanding the consequences, I suddenly stopped drinking coffee and energy drinks altogether. I just thought I needed a short break during that time.

Everything started two days after I quit. The symptoms I experienced for the next 90 days were unlike anything I’d ever felt before. Before discovering this community, I had self-diagnosed myself with 15 different illnesses and vitamin deficiencies. I visited multiple doctors because I had developed a degree of hypochondria (which I still occasionally have to this day).

Here’s a list of the symptoms I had (they all came in waves—some lasted a few days and then would fade, only to be replaced by another. There was a kind of timeline to them. I’ll explain that further below):

Aura/vestibular migraines, motion blur vision, REM rebound, tinnitus, brain zaps, electrical sensations in the body (I don’t know if this has a name), muscle twitching especially in the legs, neck, and eyelids, chest/throat tightness, throat flutters, depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), anhedonia, depressive episodes, doom feeling (mostly upon waking), panic/anxiety attacks, breathlessness, cold hands/feet, flu-like symptoms, feeling like walking on clouds (might be related to DPDR), afterimages, dizziness/vertigo, hair loss (onset was one and a half months after quitting — makes sense for telogen effluvium effect), missed menstruation, brain fog, leg tightness, ear pressure, pressure behind the eyes, tachycardia (±10 BPM at rest; my normal resting heart rate is 58 BPM), globus sensation, wild blood pressure fluctuations, intrusive thoughts, worsening OCD, insomnia, internal tremors, pins and needles, trembling hands, neck tightness, back pain, loss of strength and muscle tone, loss of libido, and last but not least, acne on my back and forehead (I never had any skin issues before).

I don’t know how many symptoms that adds up to, but it’s crazy how many appeared. I didn’t have them all from the beginning. It was like a clockwork. One would pass, then another would appear. Then something might come back after a while without having felt it for some time. Madness. That’s kind of how I developed hypochondria. I didn’t know what was happening to me. I thought I was going crazy or about to die. I told myself to be patient. The bad part was that no one believed me. Everyone said, “It’s anxiety.” Yeah, of course, it was anxiety—except for some symptoms that pointed more to neurological issues.

Then, I found something interesting that matches my experience. Your brain works through a process called “neuroplasticity-driven exposure.” In plain terms, it will bring back a symptom temporarily to test if your system can handle it. If the nervous system is still unstable → symptom persists. If it’s stabilized → symptom fades.

I did a lot of research and learned some amazing things about the recalibration of the nervous system. My symptoms also cycled throughout the day. For example, at first, the chest tightness lasted all day. Gradually, it started to decrease—to lasting only until 7 p.m., then 5, 6, 4 p.m., until it disappeared completely. This makes sense. I looked into the Cortisol Awakening Response. It’s the body’s reaction that increases cortisol in the early morning to help you wake up. Without caffeine, the body needs time to find its own footing regarding cortisol regulation, so sometimes there are misfires—especially during the morning hours.

Also, I couldn’t manage the anxiety at all. Simple situations caused me panic and various symptoms that I mentioned earlier. Even going to the market or getting on the bus was mentally exhausting. I felt like I had no control over my mind. I had no emotional control.

For me, the biggest obstacle and the most painful was the gym. Exercise is a sympathetic activity. Obviously, cortisol and adrenaline rise during exercise. And that’s the last thing the body wants during withdrawal. I used to have panic attacks at the gym and afterward as well. But I never stopped going. I knew controlled stress would help. However, the intensity of my workouts was 100% something I think did more harm than good. Hours later after the gym, I was in a ""tired but wired"" state along with a doom feeling.

The first 94 days were awful. I can’t describe it any other way. Gradually, I started having small windows of normality. The windows became bigger. More hours of normality. Maybe even days. Yes, definitely, there were some days that were awful. I thought I was back to zero. It was frustrating.

I think it’s worth noting that I started psychotherapy because I had reached a point where I was not functional. My parents thought I had GAD or panic disorder. I knew that wasn’t the case. But either way, my therapist has helped me manage my OCD and we have discussed panic attacks, which was a big relief for me. She told me it was all the energy drinks messing up my body’s chemistry.

Now I’m approaching 120 days. Although I don’t believe 120 days are enough for me. I’m aiming for 180. The reason is that during the morning hours I still have some symptoms (CAR misfires) like tightness in my throat, motion blur vision which I have for most of the day, my sleep hasn't normalised yet, brain fog on some days, and some lingering unnecessary amygdala overreactivity in public spaces. I’m not saying all symptoms have completely faded. For example, days ago I had tiny chest tightness spikes for about a minute. I didn’t react much to it. I just knew it was my body testing the waters like it does with every single anxiety symptom.

Overall, throughout this journey I have learned to listen to my body. I also learned to respect homeostasis and why it is important. But the most important thing is everything I learned about how the body recalibrates. The mechanisms are incredible and the brain always knows what it’s doing.

If anyone is going through something similar, whether intense or less so, give yourself some grace and let your body return to homeostasis. Like I said: “The brain ALWAYS knows what it does.” Your brain’s #1 priority is to protect you and itself from damage. Don’t fear the symptoms. Embrace them. It’s your body's reminder to never disrupt homeostasis again.

It takes 6 hours to mow, we get ticks, and my kids use about 30 feet of it. We live in an area that gets more rain than Seattle, so we do spend a lot more time than I'd prefer indoors.

Buying a house with an acre of land was a beautiful idea, but a beautiful reality just never came to fruition. We are completely car dependent, in an area full of ultrarich, over scheduled families. Life is boring, but the yard is beautiful. A beautiful, part time job. 

I'm looking at a house now with a postage stamp backyard. There's just enough space for our wooden playset with a little fence around it. The town itself is so cute, we would be a few blocks from a playground, right off of a Main street downtown with a coffee shop, restaurants, even an old-time candy store. 

I keep telling myself, if the weather is nice enough to play outside, it's nice enough to go for a walk around the block or to the playground. I want to be in a place where people aren't afraid to live close to each other in a community, not one where everyone just hides away on their own acre. But a part of me feels guilty for giving up the yard, even if it doesn't really serve me.

And how do you stop it?,"My partner owns a hotel I help him to run. How do you ensure employees go to their line manager over you when they believe you're accessible.

Is it consistency or do you need a stern word? We're there 24/7 and have friends visit us there for drinks or dinner from time to time. That time is precious to us because we so rarely get any time. It's almost broken us a number of times how little time we get to exist. When we had a week off our ops manager said she felt like they didn't even treat her like a person, like managers are expected to be superhuman and robotic. Sleep? Loved ones? Of course you don't have any one you love or require basic things like sleep. That is how the staff make me feel 24/7 too. Like interrupting the first time I see my parents in months because they need me to look at a printer at some point despite there being any number of people who could look at the printer.

An example is there's this one employee very bad for it at the minute who constantly interrupts moments where although we are around we aren't managing THEM right now, someone else is. We often have meetings or social meetings in the bar or restaurant that are important to us yet not deeply private. Someone else is in charge of the front of house restaurant and hotel even though we're there. We aren't their line managers.

A good example is last week an employee who has been off due to injuries coming in for a casual coffee with us as we haven't seen them since their accident, and both sides intending to discuss the transition back to work and reassure full pay until then. It's very casual and more about them getting out of the house as we call each week to see how they are. This employee interrupted about 3 times rather than wait, the coffee was less than 45 minutes. I directed them to the manager on shift.

We then had a sit down with our head chef at the end of his last day for 20 mins. We've worked with him for years at this point and wanted to leave staff leaving drinks to staff, so this was our goodbye. As we're sat reminiscing this same employee then interrupted and asked my partner, the owner, to run a coffee to a table rather than one of the employees who was maybe 20 seconds away from finishing their task. My partner ran the drink as it would have felt strange to say no to the request but it felt just as rude to interupt with it when there were plenty of other staff around.

We then had my partner's close friends drop by for a coffee, lately we get so see them about two or three times a year and two usual suspects decided now was the time to interrupt rather than 30 mins later when they left. I directed them to the manager on shift.

It's the usual faces who interrupt with non issues, things that could wait, ""sorry I can see that you're eating"". One previous employee used to somehow catch me mid mouthful with my dinner every shift we'd eat in the restaurant - it began to drive me insane and I was relieved when they moved on purely for that reason alone.

The day before the exam i was worried like a lot. I studied but you know how you always think it's not enough. So i decided to try and make a deal with a demon (yeah i know making a deal because of an exam). I wanted to find a suitable one so i searched a lot for one that suits my needs. i decided on Marbas because i study medicine he is a healer so yeah seems to fit a lot.  
I researched a lot on how to summon it (sigil, orange candles and everything needed). I read most people offer him coffee, but i am did it with tea (it worked for me so yeah).  
I prepared everything and after about 20 minutes there it was. I saw a lot of people describe him as lion-human hybrid, but to me he was just a lion. He didn't talk just stared at me at first. I thanked him for answering him and told him what i need- to help me stay calm during my exam. In return i told him i will share my story here, at first he didn't agree, but after some modulations on our deal (i needed to read all the material in one night) he agreed. I thanked him for his time and he dissapeared.  
After the ritual i did a simple card readinf (felt like it idk why) And in short, he was now waiting for me to finish my part of the deal (go over everything in one night). I started to read and it was acrually okay, i didn't feel tierd and managed to go over everything.  
I had some hours to sleep so i layed down and fell aslee in an instant (a rare thing for me) and had a dream i cleary remember (another weird thing for me). The dream was about me and a lion in the opposite side of an empty pond. He was holding a vase full of water and started drop by drop to fill the pond. When the pond was full the lion just vanished.  
In the morning i was super calm no worries or anything like that (which is rare for me since i am pretty emotional person). As i walked towards the building where the exam was about to be held i stopped by a cofe shop and bought some coffee. I didn't drink it i just thanked Marbas for the calmness and spilled in on the ground near a tree.  
As i walked in everyone was really worried (usually that affects me too), but i was still calm. I sat down and recived my test (the exam is test part and oral part) I passed the test with 24/30 and get ready for my oral questions. And here i got all of the questions i was worried about antibiotics and such (pretty har material imo), but as i started to talk i said what i know and the professor was like ""I am sorry, but..."" I asked for another question and suprisingly she allowed it. After i answer she started talking how she is very intuitive person, something about how she sees a lot of potential in me etc. Which is weird since it's the first time someone tells me such stuff during an exam.  
In the end i passed thanks to Marbas (a lot of stuff that didn's suppouse to be allowed happened, like the second question thing). I am new in this stuff, but i am glad i was able to work with him. He was nice and supportive, but also stern.",10,1749580507.0,DemonolatryPractices,8,1.0,False

1l86hr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1l86hr8/does_shout_active_enzyme_laundry_stain_remover/,Does Shout Active Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover Spray Truly Deliver? Review Inside!,"Stains, they’re an inevitable part of life. Be it spills from a busy breakfast, grass stains from a weekend adventure, or those pesky blood stains from a scraped knee—life has a way of throwing messy surprises at you. Testing products like the SHOUT 652463 Active Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover Spray has become second nature for someone like me, who seems to be laundering every other day. Let me walk you through my honest experience with this triple-acting stain remover. Spoiler alert: it’s effective, but there are a few nuances worth discussing.

**Design and Usability**  
The ergonomic design of the spray bottle wasn’t lost on me. The grip felt natural in my hand, even during longer sessions tackling piles of stained laundry. What stands out about this stain remover is its simple mechanism—just aim, spray, and rub. The fresh scent of the spray feels inviting without being overpowering, which I appreciate. Plus, it's chlorine-free, which struck me as a major plus; there’s peace of mind knowing it won’t harm fabrics. At 22 ounces, the bottle has lasted me a while, even with frequent use, though I'd advise against obsessively spraying every little drop, especially on light stains.

**Triple-Acting Formula: How It Works in Practice**  
This is no ordinary stain remover. Its triple-action formula clings to the stain, penetrates deep into the fabric, and lifts the mess right out. During my own laundry fiascos, from coffee to grass stains, I noticed that applying the formula directly post-stain yields impressive results. By simply rubbing the treated area and tossing it in the wash, stains faded significantly or disappeared entirely. Shout claims it’s “50x more concentrated than in-wash powders,” and I’d believe it after seeing how well it cut through tough stains. Those mystery stains on my son's football jersey couldn't withstand this product.

[Check SHOUT 652463 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b000vdx2ss/)  

**Performance in Variety**  
Stain removers live and die by their versatility, and this product handles a wide range impressively. Food, dirt, wine, blood—you name it, I’ve tested it on these surfaces, and it usually performs like a champ. Most stains cleared up after a single treatment, though I did encounter stubborn cases (think older, dried-in stains) where multiple treatments were required. I liked that it works across all water temperatures and is compatible with both HE and standard washers, making it a solid fit for any laundry setup.

**Strengths**  
- Works effectively on 100+ types of stains, from dirt to makeup.  
- Easy to use with visible results after just one regular wash cycle.  
- Safe for colorfast machine-washable fabrics, avoiding undue wear on delicate materials.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Multiple treatments sometimes needed for older or particularly severe stains.  
- While the product is generally gentle, overzealous rubbing on delicate fabrics could lead to wear.  
- The spray nozzle isn’t as fine as I'd like, leading to slight overspray in smaller areas.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing it to similar stain removers like OxiClean MaxForce Spray or Resolve Stain Remover, I found each has its strengths. OxiClean often felt “harsher,” and while that also meant it tackled tougher stains in fewer applications, it sometimes left a residue requiring extra rinsing. Resolve excelled with its precision spray nozzle but didn’t feel as effective on more challenging stains. The SHOUT 652463 stands somewhere in the sweet spot, balancing power with fabric-friendliness for most everyday laundry situations. That said, your stain woes may dictate which product best fits your needs.

**True Value**  
Despite its strengths, at its core, the question remains—is it worth its price tag? While I’ve seen comparable stain removers on shelves for similar costs, the longevity and versatility of this product make it an investment in laundry sanity. Its high concentration formula feels like a major win for anyone short on time and patience for stubborn stains.

1l86gln,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedicNosleep/comments/1l86gln/strange_diner/,Strange Diner,"Out in the holler where the kudzu grows and the forest is thick, beyond the bridge that runs over the creek, and a few miles south of the town, there sits a diner.  

It’s old as shit and has a small gravel parking lot that the church in the woods likes to use for its bimonthly celebrations, but it’s almost always open. (The only time it’s ever closed was that one time a tornado came through. And even then, people were still able to get food from the back window.)

If you were to stop by and pop in, you’d probably get just about what you’d expect from any old country diner. It’s about the size of a short, double wide trailer. So, the interior is a bit claustrophobic, but just spacious enough that you won’t feel trapped. It has a unique…smell— like cigarette smoke and floral perfume had some fucked-up love child and decided it needed to die there. Pictures of unidentifiable people eating are randomly taped to the wood-paneled walls (partially for advertising but mostly to cover some holes). A flickering neon “open” sign sits in one of the large windows. They’re framed with old Christmas lights and let in a natural light when the sun’s up, but also allow you get a full view of the road, surrounding woods, or Lucky, the veteran coyote, as you eat.  

He’s not exactly a vet, as he’s never really been in any war— not any major ones, at least. Just the on-going one that he has against the local farmers and their chickens, but it’s left the poor bastard looking like he just came out of Nam. He’s only got one eye, three feet, half an ear, and the fur on his tail seemingly refuses to grow normally. We (and by we, I mean I) felt bad and gave him a piece of some expired food, one time. And now, he refuses to leave. He’s been hit by at least three cars and two trucks (that we know of) and still insists on staring at people as they eat.  

Another sight you may have the misfortune, (or blessing depending on who you ask) of seeing out those windows, would be what we have dubbed as “the sign dancer.” A hairy and rather…voluptuous man who will occasionally appear and pole dance on the sign out front. We’re not sure if he’s a ghost or just some dude with too much time on his hands, but we do know that his dances can make people feel things. It’s different for everyone, Mrs. Kelvins said she felt peace for the first time in years, while Mr. Branson said he felt “true” horror. However, after having watched the man dance myself, I’d say it was interesting, but mostly kinda disturbing. (Like watching someone chug expired milk.)  

As for upkeep, I’m pretty sure it’s just seen as an aesthetic choice.  

An old, eyeless mannequin with a purple Mardi Gras necklace and a name tag sticker on its chest that reads “Hello! My name is: Tomila” sits next to the entrance as a makeshift coatrack. If you get close enough to it, you’ll notice it has that sickly sweet aroma of rot clinging to it. (No matter how much it’s cleaned or sprayed with Febreze, it will not go away.) A cork board covered in papers, ranging from missing pet posters to advertisements and a few newspaper clippings, sits on the other side. Booths are lined up against smudged windows and advertisements for local businesses are trapped under the clear, yet sticky, plastic coverings on the tables.

There’s an open kitchen, with grease-stained utilities that haven’t been updated since poodle skirts were a thing, and coffee pots that look like they survived Chernobyl. A dented mini fridge softly hums at the back wall, next to the batter covered waffle irons that strangely smell like burnt hair every time they’re used. There’s a milkshake station (It’s continued functionality is proof that miracles really do exist, and honestly, it’s what gets me through the day sometimes.) that sits next to the drink machine, where the stubborn, red sticky mess beneath it all has been fighting with the grease to become a permanent fixture. The checkered linoleum floors are cracked and stained in some places. Sometimes when it rains, a mysterious brownish liquid— that smells oddly like pennies —oozes from them and forms shapes similar to human footprints. A jukebox, riddled with bullet holes, sits next to the bathroom hallway (Sometimes it “glitches” and the screams of children come from it. Usually, it has to be unplugged for a few minutes whenever that happens.) and plays country music and the occasional pop or rock song.  

I’m not one hundred percent sure, but I think the health inspector is either sleeping with the owners’ daughter or has brain damage or (who knows) maybe it’s both. Like, this guy will straight up look at the weird black goop stuff in the mop station and be like, “Yeah, this is okay.” It’s shady as fuck, but if there’s one thing we can count on, it’s that he’ll sign off on this shit hole as being “safe,” like, pretty much no matter what.  

If you find yourself needing to go number one or two (or three) after a meal or just in general, then you may find a hot dog on the floor next to the toilet paper rack. Its appearance in one of the two bathrooms depends entirely on what day of the week it is, though. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will be in the men’s room. But on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, it will be in the women’s room. It’s absent on Saturdays. And while we highly suggest against its consumption, we cannot control what you do.

Having said that, the people who have eaten it claim it allowed them to have seen into the future for a few hours. Others became violently ill (just as we predicted they would), and were doomed to spend their evening in the very room they consumed the forsaken cylinder of meat in.  

If you do stop by, don’t be a stranger! I’m pretty much always on the clock and I’m more than happy to take your order or sit and chat or both! I’m bored as fuck and my coworker, Kurt, isn’t a very good conversationalist. And there isn’t any phone service or internet at diner. So, if you have any important calls to make, you’ll have to go out to the edge of the road. Or you can use the old phone booth! It’s pretty much in the same place. It’s next to the only streetlight we have out here, so it’s pretty hard to miss. Do be careful if you ever have to use it, though. We have the occasional hobo or crazy person come out of the woods to try and “phone home.” They can get pretty violent, and as much as I’d like the show, I’m supposed to treat the parking lot fights as though they were happening in-store. The owners put that rule in place, and they review the cameras to make sure we break them up. And I really don’t want to deal with anymore violence than I already have to. (I am very tired, and I am not a very large or strong lady. So, breaking up fights is very hard for me. Please think of me and the consequences of your own actions.)

On the odd occasion that I’m not working, but you still want to chat with someone. Then I highly suggest that you be cautious with the locals. Some of them are lovely people, don’t get me wrong. I’d just rather not leave Kurt to deal with a fight, should one break out, while I’m not there. Because, while Southern hospitality is a given with most of our regulars, it can still…run a bit short, if you know what I mean.

If you go in the mornings you may meet a fair bit of them, like Mr. Stimson, an older man who usually comes between the hours of seven andnine AM to order a few cups of coffee and a gravy biscuit. He used to own the old scrap yard. And despite there not being any big wild cats native to this area and the nearest zoo not housing any, he will tell you all about how his dogs were snatched, one at a time, by a black panther. Never mind the fact that he has only ever had but one dog. (It’s very sweet and follows him like a little shadow. Sometimes he brings it to the diner.)

Mr. Canterbury, he always gets the morning special that comes with one waffle, two eggs, and a side of bacon or sausage. But he gets the bacon instead of the sausage, because he claims that it “taste too much like human flesh.” (I can assure you now, that the sausage is not made of flesh. We’re not sure where it comes from, but the owners assured us that we weren’t eating living people.)

Ms. Cleo Janice comes in late in the afternoon and orders exactly one egg, a thing of cheesy hash browns, and a strawberry milkshake. She always says that Tomila is “crying” and that the mannequin is “sick.” Me and Kurt think she may be projecting her feelings and trying to ask for some form of help. But the last time we just up and asked if she needed any, she wound up getting a bit…violent, insisting that it was Tomila that was needing help. We’ve considered banning her from the diner, but she tips, like, really good. So, we just keep our mouths shut and give her what she orders.

Then there’s Mr. Johnson. He doesn’t really have a usual meal, insisting that we should “surprise” him and give him whatever. However, he always refuses to drink water. He claimed our water had made him unable to eat fish. As every time he saw one, it apparently had his late wife’s face and would “beg him to stop” or “let go” with her voice.

If you have questions, then so do it. But unfortunately for the both of us, they will forever go unanswered. Because Mr. Johnson, the slippery bastard that he was, died. They found him in his kitchen a few months ago, soaking wet. Apparently, he somehow managed to drown himself while eating fish tacos.

So, to sum it all up, the diner is weird as fuck, but it’s become a major part of my life. So, I figured I’d start sharing a few of my experiences with y’all.",1,1749580334.0,ComedicNosleep,0,1.0,False
1l86fm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1l86fm4/is_avoidance_really_the_way/,Is avoidance really the way?,"I mean no disrespect to the people who have provided me with advice on my last post. I deeply appreciate it but deep down I feel something isn’t right about totally cutting out stimulants and certain habits just cuz of a panic attack.

I got my first panic attack 2 months ago and have had alotta side effects from that- like constant anxiety and OCD. Slowly I have controlled it and the journey is making me resilient to the fallbacks so I can recover from it faster than before. 

Many people online say that panic attack is a way of your body saying that it’s time to change your approach to things. So what should I do in that pov with respect to alcohol and vices? Forcing myself to eat big meals(like I used to before panic attack), talking to friends, hanging out and etc… helped me to overcome like 90% of my symptoms and make me more resistant to it. So why should I not go back having the occasional alcohol and maybe some cigs like before? 

Obviously, my opinion doesn’t apply to everyone. For people with families depending on them, the straightforward solution is to take therapy and meds so that they can focus on other aspects of their lives. However, I’m literally just 22 and do not feel willing to let go of my vices just right now. I also wanna have my coffee without feeling weird. 

Honestly idek what I’m saying rn but is there anyone who brute forced their way out of anxiety after panic attacks? I mean I haven’t taken a single medication and have always rawdogged my anxiety/panic attacks. The intensity is always different but my resistance towards them is increasing cuz I’m just so done by something that is basically my brain fooling me.",1,1749580272.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

So I happily kept my marriage a secret for three years.
At a departmental potluck, a female intern insisted that we play her special card game.
[Grinds face-to-face across the opposite gender for ten seconds.]
She immediately picked Jack and giggled.
“Do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Harrison?”
There was a pause, and Jack shook his head while everyone made that knowingly nasty noise.
She immediately climbed on top of him, biting her lip and putting on a show.
The whole time, she kept shooting me smug looks.
Then it was Jake's turn.
[Thirty seconds of making out with the nearest member of the opposite gender]
The intern's on his left. I'm on his right.
He hesitated. - So did I.

The vibe in the VIP booth was absolutely wild, and I clutched my drink with sweaty palms.

Three years of marriage, and Jake was clearly over me. Done. Finished.

But just now? He couldn't keep his hands off River's tiny waist, staring at her like she was some kind of goddess or something.

The vodka fumes were making my eyes bu//rn, so I quickly ducked my head to hide the mess I was becoming.

With everyone cheering them on, Jake leaned over and whispered:

""Chill, it's just a stupid game. Don't be like that.""

Then boom—he spun around, grabbed River's face, and went in for the kill.

Someone literally squealed, and they finally came up for air looking all hot and bothered.

Timer stopped at fifty-seven seconds.

River licked her lips with this cat-that-ate-the-canary grin and slid the cards my way.

That's when I noticed I'd practically drawn blood digging my nails into my palms.

Jake grabbed my hand before I could draw a card, his voice ice-cold:

""Yo, hold up—isn't our creative director married? This is kinda messed up, right?""

The whole team went full gossip mode, eyes practically bugging out: ""Wait, WHAT? Who bagged our ice queen boss lady?""

I stayed quiet, shot Jake this bitter smile, and said:

""Yep, guilty as charged. Three shots it is.""

After I threw back the alcohol, River gave me this fake-sweet wink.

""Aww, sorry hun, but married people can't play our little games. If you're not having fun, there's the door.""

Jake just sat there like a statue, acting like she wasn't talking about him too.

I snatched my phone and practically ran, my heart doing this weird breaking-apart thing.

The party was still going strong behind me.

I collapsed against the wall outside, catching pieces of River's voice floating through the door.

""But for real though, who would want to tap that? She's boring. I bet she knows like, two positions max.""

""Her poor husband probably wanted out before the honeymoon was over.""

Everyone lost it laughing, and then after this awful pause, Jake's voice cut through:

""Yeah, pretty much.""

Those three words su//cker-punched me so hard I couldn't breathe. Ice shot up from my feet straight to my heart.

So he'd been done with me all along.

I threw my head back, swallowed the tears, and dialed a divorce attorney.

Got home to our pathetically empty house and just sat there staring at nothing. Then I wandered into Jake's room like some kind of masochist.

We'd been doing the whole separate bedrooms thing for two years now—basically glorified roommates who split the mortgage.

His room was pristine. No surprises there.

I was about to bail when this fancy little gift box on his desk caught my eye.

Jake wasn't exactly Mr. Romance—besides my engagement ring, the guy had never bought me so much as a coffee.

Curiosity killed the cat, so I popped it open and just... froze.

It was that Tiffany necklace I'd been stalking online for months but couldn't justify dropping two grand on.

Even more stunning in person.

And then it hit me like a brick—tomorrow was my birthday.

I ran my fingers over the necklace, watching it catch the light and throw off these gorgeous sparkles. For a hot second, my resolve started wavering.

The lawyer texted asking if I could meet tomorrow to go over everything.

After staring at my phone for like two seconds, I typed back: ""Let's do next week instead. No rush.""

Jake didn't stumble in until one AM, absolutely wasted, wrapping me up in this sloppy hug while fishing a greasy bag from his coat.

""You didn't eat dinner. You know you get hangry.""

I sighed and took the In-N-Out bag, steadying him as we headed to his room.

Right after I turned off the lights, his phone suddenly lit up.

Video message from River. Something made me grab his phone and unlock it.

What I saw made my blood turn to ice.

The hallway outside the bar. Jake had River pinned against the wall, going at it like the world was ending.

The look in his eyes—pure fire, raw hunger. Stuff I'd never seen directed at me. Not once.

I let out this hollow laugh. Yeah, some ""game.""

Then the messages popped up:

[Ugh, I guess I'll survive being attacked by a horny caveman. You're welcome.]

[Your little friend down there kept jabbing me the whole time. Seriously gross.]

My hands were shaking as I scrolled up, but everything above that was wiped clean.

River had started at our company two weeks ago as Jake's intern.

Drop-dead gorgeous and shameless about flaunting it. Different barely-there outfit every day, serving main character energy to everyone she met.

I'd caught guys sneaking photos, so I pulled her aside about professional dress code and tore those creeps new ones.

She nodded like butter wouldn't melt, then turned around and called me a ""bitter old hag"" to those same guys.

When I asked Jake what he thought about River, he barely looked up:

""She's twenty-two, she wants to look cute. Not like she's gonna dress like someone pushing thirty.""

Then he shot me this pointed look.

""Moe, you're being jealous and petty. Can't handle someone else getting attention.""

That shut me right up.

Looking back, I should've seen the writing on the wall. He was already gone.

Next morning, Jake barged into my office looking ready to murder someone and slammed River's evaluation papers on my desk.

""Are you kidding me right now? All this over some party drama?""

""You realize you could actually tank her career because you're throwing a tantrum?""

The papers scattered everywhere. I swallowed the lump in my throat, gathered them up, and said evenly:

""The evaluation reflects her actual performance. If you have concerns, take it up with HR.""

When I didn't cave, Jake's tone shifted, going all smooth and manipulative:

""Come on, you know what it's like being a woman in this business.""

""And it's her birthday today. She was so excited, now she's a complete mess because of you.""

When I still didn't respond, he leaned forward:

""Just say you're sorry, promise her a decent review next month. Think of it as a birthday gift.""

""If you're worried about looking weak in front of the team, I'll bring her here privately.""

Jake hadn't tried this hard to convince me of anything in years.

Before I could tell him to go to he//ll, he was already ushering in a red-eyed River.

River immediately latched onto his arm like some wounded deer, bottom lip trembling perfectly on cue.

That's when I spotted the necklace glittering at her throat. The same one from his room.

My heart felt like someone had punched a hole through it. I actually started laughing—couldn't stop myself. What a complete joke I'd been.

I took a long sip of coffee to steady my voice:

""River, maybe spend less time crying and more time not being terrible at your job. Your campaign ideas are absolutely tragic.""

Her waterworks kicked into overdrive as she shrieked:

""You're just jealous because I'm young and gorgeous! You're trying to ruin my life!""

Then she stormed out, slamming the door so hard the whole office shook.

Suddenly everyone was covering their mouths, whispering and side-eyeing me like I'd just kicked a puppy.

Jake's face went dark: ""Moe, you're really disappointing me right now.""

And just like that, he bolted after her.

I clenched my fists, shut my door, and buried every emotion deep down while I got back to work.

Right before five, River posted in the group chat about her birthday dinner tonight—her treat, everyone welcome.

The chat exploded with ""Happy birthday!"" messages. Jake sent ninety-nine of them. I counted.

All the tears I'd been holding back finally came crashing down, hitting my paperwork like fat raindrops.

Jake texted me:

[River doesn't have a ride. Gonna drop her off at the restaurant. Just head home without me.]

I typed and deleted a message like ten times before finally hitting send.

One last roll of the dice.

[It's my birthday too, you know.]

Five whole minutes passed before he responded:

[Sorry. If you'd mentioned it earlier I totally would've done something, but I already promised River.]

[What do you want? I'll grab you something on my way back.]

I pulled up the blinds and watched our whole team parade out with River at the center like some kind of queen bee.

Jake stood next to her grinning like a fool, holding this massive bouquet of roses and a bunch of fancy gift bags.

They looked like the perfect couple getting showered with congratulations.

Meanwhile, I was hiding in the shadows like some dirty secret.

[Don't worry about it. I'll just grab something myself.]

I waited until the lobby was completely empty before wiping my eyes and heading home.

Sitting there with those divorce papers in my lap, this awful bitter feeling settled in my heart.

I figured I'd wait for Jake to get back so we could talk about splitting up.

Instead, River showed up at my door.

""She got cornered by some creep right outside her place. I had no choice but to bring her back here.""

""Poor kid just graduated—she can't afford anything safe. Let's just let her crash with us for a while.""

I leaned against the doorframe, saying nothing, just watching River sob into his arms like some wounded bird.

""When did you become so petty?"" Jake snapped, letting out this bitter laugh. ""Oh right, someone like you would never deal with this kind of sh//it. Can't relate, huh?""

I turned around and shut the door behind me.

Thing is, I was broke when I first graduated too. Lived in this sketchy neighborhood where rent was dirt cheap.

Total war zone—dealers, addicts, you name it. Two people got murdered there in one month.

Every night after work, I'd grip a box cutter in my pocket just to make it upstairs alive.

Even being that careful, some psycho still picked my lock one night.

Lucky for me, I had nightmares all the time and kept scissors under my pillow. That's the only reason I didn't get rap//ed or worse.

Predators don't care what you look like when they want to hurt you.

I could hear Jake's voice through the wall, all soft and gentle as he comforted River.

It reminded me of three years ago when he used to talk to me like that.

During that crazy flood—once-in-a-century storm that trapped me in the underground garage.

Water was up to my neck, bodies floating past me. I was screaming for help, choking on nasty floodwater.

Right when I thought I was done for, Jake appeared out of nowhere and grabbed my hand, dragging us both toward higher ground.

""Hang on! We're gonna make it out of this!""

But I was totally spent. He kept falling trying to pull me along.

I was crying, telling him: ""Just go! Leave me here!""

He wouldn't listen. Gritted his teeth and hauled me onto his back.

""Moe, if we die, we die together.""

After we made it out, I completely lost it, sobbing in his arms right there on the street. He just smiled and said:

""Guess we're ride-or-die now.""

That's how we ended up together. Dating, then married.

Funny thing is, looking back, I don't think Jake ever actually said he loved me.

River was sleeping in his room—the same room he never let me into anymore.

When I opened my bedroom door, he was sitting on the couch like he'd been waiting forever.

""River's pretty shaken up. She needs someone with her.""

""She's not comfortable around you, and you know I can't sleep in strange places,"" he said, hesitating. ""So... could you maybe grab a hotel room tonight?""

Logical and completely insane at the same time.

I stared at him, my throat tight: ""Sure.""

I left the signed divorce papers on the table and quickly packed my stuff.

On my way out, Jake was in the kitchen making River some honey tea.

Watching the steam rise from the mug, I smiled this empty smile and couldn't help myself:

""You need to use warm water, not hot.""

He had this ""duh"" moment and dumped out the scalding water, muttering thanks without even looking at me.

You're welcome, I thought.

Three years of marriage, and he'd never cooked me a single meal or made me one cup of honey tea.

Guess the difference between love and obligation is pretty obvious.

When he carried the mug back to the bedroom, he noticed my suitcase.

""You're taking a lot of stuff.""

""I need to take care of River, so I won't walk you out.""

I glanced at the pitch-black night outside and nodded like I understood.

I waited in that hotel room for hours. Jake never called—probably too busy playing nurse.

Which meant he never saw those divorce papers.

Next afternoon, passing by the break room, I caught some office gossip.

""They're totally hooking up. And living together now.""

""I've been shipping them forever. That necklace River's wearing? Jake bought it. I looked it up—like fifteen grand.""

""Someone saw them making out at her birthday party last night.""

Rain started pounding against the windows, and my ch//est felt like someone was squeezing my heart until it burst.

I stumbled back to my office, shaking uncontrollably.

That flood left me with serious PTSD. Heavy rain still sends me into complete panic mode.

Ten minutes later, Jake rushed in and locked the door, pulling me into his arms.

""Hey, it's okay. Storm's almost over.""

He automatically reached for my anxiety meds in the desk drawer, but the bottle was empty.

""Hold tight, I'll grab your prescription.""

He never came back.

My assistant texted:

[River's having bad cramps. Jake took her to the ER and called in sick.]

I pressed my shaking hands flat on the desk and typed back: [Thanks.]

Rush hour traffic meant no Ubers, and I was too messed up to drive. So I just huddled in my office waiting.

Around eight, I finally got a ride. But I was so out of it, I forgot to change the address.

The driver dropped me off at my old place—the house was all lit up.

The moment I walked in, I heard sounds from the guest room. Sounds that made everything crystal clear.

I dragged myself down the hallway and saw two bodies tangled together, clothes scattered everywhere.

Turns out when pain hits that level, you just go numb.

River wasn't having cramps. And Jake definitely wasn't the cold, distant guy I'd been married to.",3,1749580181.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1l86dzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianTheology/comments/1l86dzp/a_4_word_catechism/,A 4 Word Catechism,"A young boy grew up in rural western Kentucky. His parents ran a dairy, and this extended family were small business entrepreneurs. In his teens he was given the opportunity to participate in the diary not just as an underpaid worker, but as someone who would be allowed to purchase calves, raise them and take a working share of the profits from his cows.

As was the dream of every young man of his time he loved cars. His uncle ran a used car lot in a nearby town. So as he was about to graduate high school, he was able to purchase a slightly used 1962 maroon corvette to take to college.

In college, two events happened that would change the trajectory of his life and of the lives of thousands of others. He met his future wife at a food drive in while he was driving his corvette, and he enlisted in the Navel Reserve.

After graduation he applied for naval aviation training to become a pilot and succeeded. Soon after getting his wings he married the beautiful women he had met in college.

Over the years he flew fighter jets off the decks of many carriers serving in the Viet Nam war and in Desert Storm years later. He was the leading pilot on every carrier he served on concluding with 1,220 carrier “catches.” He served as a based commander at the top stateside naval bases including Miramar. He was a Top Gun graduate and later a Top Gun instructor and late still, he flew the “opposition” jets that challenged the Top Gun pilots. He served two tours of the Pentagon including one assignment as the person responsible for the development of the Navy budget.

He lost friends in combat and from accidents. On one occasion while playing a pickup basketball game- every Kentucky citizen believes they are basketball wizzards- he was notified that an aircraft that had been in for repair needed a check ride by a pilot, which was standard practice. He and his best friend decided to flip a coin to see who continued playing basketball and which did a no-brainer check ride. His friend lost that flip of the coin.

An hour later alarms started sounding on base and a “plane down” alert was issued. He jumped into the truck with the rest of the rescue team and headed for the scene of the crash a few miles away and just offshore. From the front of the leading rescue boat he saw his friend still in the pilot’s seat trying to open the canopy which should have blown off prior to the crash. Nobody was able to get the canopy off and he watched his friend slowly drown 5ft from where he stood on the deck of the rescue boat.

He had lost people before. It was never easy, but this one hurt a lot. I can still hear the pain in his voice as he told me this story 25 years later.

That hunting trip was two days up and two days back, so we had a lot of windshield time. One morning on the way back we stopped for gas at a station that also had a restaurant. While he finished his coffee, I headed out to fill up the truck. As I left, I noticed a young twenty-something man sitting on the ground leaning up against the restaurant with a shepherd-mix dog at his side. As I started filling the truck my friend came out of the restaurant, saw the man and dog and sat down on the cold ground with them. They started talking and talking and talking for what seemed like a long time as I sat in the truck and waited.

“What was that all about?” I asked. He told me this young man’s life story of an abusive alcoholic, divorced father, of getting addicted and escaping his addiction finding a stray dog and his plans to travel to his aunt’s house in Dallas to start over. As we were headed to Austin, we could not offer him a ride. “What did you give him?” “I gave him $50 dollars” he told me. Then he explained.

“I have lost a lot of friends and good men in my life and the single most powerful emotion I felt after grief was frustration that I could not help any one of them. That feeling never leaves me. So I made a promise to myself that every opportunity that comes my way where I can help somebody, I will. I keep several fifty-dollar bills folded up in my wallet. Over the years I have probably given away thousands of dollars.

There was a guy begging on a street corner near where we grocery shop. I started off giving him money but one day I walked back from the grocery store and sat down on the street curb to talk to him. His name was Arron Adams. He was homeless. I asked him where he stayed, and he told me where the homeless shelter he used was located. Over the next year we became friends. I would always take him to lunch and give him $50 when I was in his part of town. One day he was gone. I went to the homeless shelter, and they told me that he was gone, and nobody knew where he went. That old feeling of regret came back to me, but I had done what I could.”

Wherever I go and whoever I meet my instinct is to ask myself “How can I help.”

I have known a woman for 46 years. She had an amazing executive career with a national telecommunications company. Her kids and my kids were about the same age and our families lived near each other. We stayed in touch over the years but when she retired, I lost track of her. She dropped me a note a few years back and asked what I was doing with my retirement.  We struck up a conversation about what each of us was doing.

I was surprised to learn that even though she had traveled the world and built lifelong friendships across the nation, she had found enormous satisfaction in her current passion of many years. She is a child advocate in the Houston family court system.

The pain and suffering she deals with daily could worm a mule. Child abuse, child abandonment, broken children, fights, drugs, disinterested judges, arrests you name it, she is right in the middle of it day and night. I have never understood the level of personal sacrifice, emotional pain, feelings of personal failure and utter frustration that comes with this unpaid work of love she had undertaken mostly with a smile but always with passion. She had a mild stroke a few years ago that has reduced her ease of mobility, but it has not slowed her down. She always takes birthday and Christmas gifts to “her children.” Those she is protecting and those who have found adopted parents. To me angels are those who are willing to suffer deeply for the opportunity to help others and show God’s love to the innocent, to people in need and to those who are unworthy of her sacrifices. I asked her why she has chosen this very difficult and emotionally draining endeavor so late in her life. She told me that everyday she wakes up, looks at the case files in front of her and asks God “how can I help?” and there is always an answer.

A dear friend that I have had the pleasure of knowing for the past 10 years is another example I admire. He has been a pastor for quite a few years. He also has another calling. His advanced education was in counseling. Wherever he goes he becomes a Chaplin to the local police department. Here it was to the Fort Bend Texas Sheriff’s Department. Over the years he has been called out at all hours of the day and night to the scenes of murders, child drownings, suicides, deaths on the highway and virtually every form of violent crime where there is a victim. His wife has become an expert at getting blood out of his clothing. He talks about God’s love by day and delivers God’s love by night. He is a hero of mine. When he accepted a new pastoring opportunity in another state, the Fort Bend Sheriff's Dept threw him an appreciation reception that was attended not only by those on duty but by those who came in from off duty to say goodbye. He was both loved and admired. Many had never heard him preach a sermon, but they had all seen him performing the kind of sermon nobody forgets.  When he gets to the scene of a disaster, he always asks the same question, “How can I Help?”

Christianity writ large contains lots of mental gymnastics these days. What are the doctrines? What are the Creeds.”  “Salvation” is a mental process that virtually never interferes with the normal lifestyle of the “converted.” Most of us could not pick a Christian out of a crowd at any even or in any public space. Christian behavior is neither distinguishable nor identifiable. For some Christianity is just divine insurance. It is a kind of get out of hell card if you ever need one.

For many, Christianity is purely a vertical relationship. We here on earth look up into the sky and worship a distant God who lives in heaven. His primary task is to determine if you have enough faith in Him to be allowed into Heaven.

Sadly, Christianity in America is declining and for those between 18-40, it is declining fastest. At its core, 21^(st) century Christianity is all about me. “What do I need to do to be saved?” “What church makes me feel most comfortable?” “What creeds do I agree with?” “Is the local church made up of people like me? You know, my education level, my social economic level, my race, my age group, my part of town, my style of dress, my accent, my kind of music, etc.” The biggest religious conflict many have is, “Can I fit church attendance into my and my families very busy schedule?”

Perhaps Christianity might prosper and become more meaningful in our lives if we just stuck with the 4 word catechism of “How can I help?” In its most powerful form, Christianity is about who you serve. You can’t serve God without serving your fellow man. If you only serve yourself in this life, you have missed the point of why you were born.

In the words of the poet:

You may be an ambassador to England or France  
You may like to gamble; you might like to dance  
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world  
You might be a socialite with a long string of pearls

But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed  
You're gonna have to serve somebody  
Well, it may be the Devil, or it may be the Lord  
But you're gonna have to serve somebody

Might be a rock 'n' roll addict prancing on the stage  
You might have drugs at your command, women in a cage  
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief  
They may call you doctor, or they may call you chief

But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes, you are

**A** young man signs up to become a Marine. After basic training, foreign service and a series of extensive testing, the young Marine has the option to enter the medical service and receive training as a corpsman. His job is to risk his life should the need arise to save other Marines that have fallen.

As the years pass the young marine decides to leave that Marines and find a place in the healthcare system as part of this life’s work. After years of education and training he becomes a pediatric nurse. In this role he works as part of medical teams dealing with very sick newborn children. Work is taxing both physically and emotionally.

To continue to serve, he finds a church with the facilities and the heart for caring for young children. For the past 15 years each Sunday he and his wife tend to the newborns for mothers wanting to attend the worship services. Even though he and his wife are raising 6 kids of their own, this man not only volunteers at his church but is also an unpaid volunteer at the Houston Livestock and Rodeo which utilizes over 35,000 volunteers. He is part of two teams of over 50 doctors and nurses each that staff two locations at the rodeo, all serving as volunteers.

When he was interviewed about his time in the Marines and his subsequent role as a pediatric nurse, he was asked what led him to participate in two such varied pursuits in life.

His humble answer was instructive. “I guess I have always had a serving heart.”

21^(st) Century Christianity is wonderfully served by some that just happen to have a serving heart. However, there is no clear program that is designed from the very start to teach, to encourage and to celebrate the serving heart which is the keystone and most distinctive characteristic called for by Jesus.

When we arise from the waters of Baptism to “Walk in new life” perhaps this is when churches should focus on building in every newborn Christian a serving heart.",1,1749580172.0,ChristianTheology,0,1.0,False

Malcom landgraab is hard to love but somehow found a snobbish Jill who acts just like him. Actually after his family got off worded by the game I brought them back and crashed her house so she lived with them for a while. He was a teen then, I later kicked her and her two dogs out… off world. 
Now Malcom is climbing the ranks in the police career with no love prospects and somehow Jill pops up, they hit it off. Jill asked him on a date at a coffee shop which I thought was horrendous but went well according to them. 
Soon enough she asks him on another date, Malcom gets his first kiss and they woohoo in the bush… so I thought the date was going pretty well. As they are going back in the bush to “try for baby”, date ends and Jill basically is pissed and says; don’t call me. But in the bush they go. 
Malcom goes about his business until his house is getting broken into 3 nights later, as the burglar comes creeping in, I spot a heavily pregnant Jill at the front door. But by the time the whole drama with the burglar is over, she’s gone. 
Malcom then gets a phone call at 4am that morning that they have a beautiful baby boy. 
Babies can be hard, but he has a kids room. I’m not sure what to do with his off world baby. Malcom is evil so I guess he can ignore his baby.

So I happily kept my marriage a secret for three years.
At a departmental potluck, a female intern insisted that we play her special card game.
[Grinds face-to-face across the opposite gender for ten seconds.]
She immediately picked Jack and giggled.
“Do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Harrison?”
There was a pause, and Jack shook his head while everyone made that knowingly nasty noise.
She immediately climbed on top of him, biting her lip and putting on a show.
The whole time, she kept shooting me smug looks.
Then it was Jake's turn.
[Thirty seconds of making out with the nearest member of the opposite gender]
The intern's on his left. I'm on his right.
He hesitated. - So did I.

The vibe in the VIP booth was absolutely wild, and I clutched my drink with sweaty palms.

Three years of marriage, and Jake was clearly over me. Done. Finished.

But just now? He couldn't keep his hands off River's tiny waist, staring at her like she was some kind of goddess or something.

The vodka fumes were making my eyes bu//rn, so I quickly ducked my head to hide the mess I was becoming.

With everyone cheering them on, Jake leaned over and whispered:

""Chill, it's just a stupid game. Don't be like that.""

Then boom—he spun around, grabbed River's face, and went in for the kill.

Someone literally squealed, and they finally came up for air looking all hot and bothered.

Timer stopped at fifty-seven seconds.

River licked her lips with this cat-that-ate-the-canary grin and slid the cards my way.

That's when I noticed I'd practically drawn blood digging my nails into my palms.

Jake grabbed my hand before I could draw a card, his voice ice-cold:

""Yo, hold up—isn't our creative director married? This is kinda messed up, right?""

The whole team went full gossip mode, eyes practically bugging out: ""Wait, WHAT? Who bagged our ice queen boss lady?""

I stayed quiet, shot Jake this bitter smile, and said:

""Yep, guilty as charged. Three shots it is.""

After I threw back the alcohol, River gave me this fake-sweet wink.

""Aww, sorry hun, but married people can't play our little games. If you're not having fun, there's the door.""

Jake just sat there like a statue, acting like she wasn't talking about him too.

I snatched my phone and practically ran, my heart doing this weird breaking-apart thing.

The party was still going strong behind me.

I collapsed against the wall outside, catching pieces of River's voice floating through the door.

""But for real though, who would want to tap that? She's boring. I bet she knows like, two positions max.""

""Her poor husband probably wanted out before the honeymoon was over.""

Everyone lost it laughing, and then after this awful pause, Jake's voice cut through:

""Yeah, pretty much.""

Those three words su//cker-punched me so hard I couldn't breathe. Ice shot up from my feet straight to my heart.

So he'd been done with me all along.

I threw my head back, swallowed the tears, and dialed a divorce attorney.

Got home to our pathetically empty house and just sat there staring at nothing. Then I wandered into Jake's room like some kind of masochist.

We'd been doing the whole separate bedrooms thing for two years now—basically glorified roommates who split the mortgage.

His room was pristine. No surprises there.

I was about to bail when this fancy little gift box on his desk caught my eye.

Jake wasn't exactly Mr. Romance—besides my engagement ring, the guy had never bought me so much as a coffee.

Curiosity killed the cat, so I popped it open and just... froze.

It was that Tiffany necklace I'd been stalking online for months but couldn't justify dropping two grand on.

Even more stunning in person.

And then it hit me like a brick—tomorrow was my birthday.

I ran my fingers over the necklace, watching it catch the light and throw off these gorgeous sparkles. For a hot second, my resolve started wavering.

The lawyer texted asking if I could meet tomorrow to go over everything.

After staring at my phone for like two seconds, I typed back: ""Let's do next week instead. No rush.""

Jake didn't stumble in until one AM, absolutely wasted, wrapping me up in this sloppy hug while fishing a greasy bag from his coat.

""You didn't eat dinner. You know you get hangry.""

I sighed and took the In-N-Out bag, steadying him as we headed to his room.

Right after I turned off the lights, his phone suddenly lit up.

Video message from River. Something made me grab his phone and unlock it.

What I saw made my blood turn to ice.

The hallway outside the bar. Jake had River pinned against the wall, going at it like the world was ending.

The look in his eyes—pure fire, raw hunger. Stuff I'd never seen directed at me. Not once.

I let out this hollow laugh. Yeah, some ""game.""

Then the messages popped up:

[Ugh, I guess I'll survive being attacked by a horny caveman. You're welcome.]

[Your little friend down there kept jabbing me the whole time. Seriously gross.]

My hands were shaking as I scrolled up, but everything above that was wiped clean.

River had started at our company two weeks ago as Jake's intern.

Drop-dead gorgeous and shameless about flaunting it. Different barely-there outfit every day, serving main character energy to everyone she met.

I'd caught guys sneaking photos, so I pulled her aside about professional dress code and tore those creeps new ones.

She nodded like butter wouldn't melt, then turned around and called me a ""bitter old hag"" to those same guys.

When I asked Jake what he thought about River, he barely looked up:

""She's twenty-two, she wants to look cute. Not like she's gonna dress like someone pushing thirty.""

Then he shot me this pointed look.

""Moe, you're being jealous and petty. Can't handle someone else getting attention.""

That shut me right up.

Looking back, I should've seen the writing on the wall. He was already gone.

Next morning, Jake barged into my office looking ready to murder someone and slammed River's evaluation papers on my desk.

""Are you kidding me right now? All this over some party drama?""

""You realize you could actually tank her career because you're throwing a tantrum?""

The papers scattered everywhere. I swallowed the lump in my throat, gathered them up, and said evenly:

""The evaluation reflects her actual performance. If you have concerns, take it up with HR.""

When I didn't cave, Jake's tone shifted, going all smooth and manipulative:

""Come on, you know what it's like being a woman in this business.""

""And it's her birthday today. She was so excited, now she's a complete mess because of you.""

When I still didn't respond, he leaned forward:

""Just say you're sorry, promise her a decent review next month. Think of it as a birthday gift.""

""If you're worried about looking weak in front of the team, I'll bring her here privately.""

Jake hadn't tried this hard to convince me of anything in years.

Before I could tell him to go to he//ll, he was already ushering in a red-eyed River.

River immediately latched onto his arm like some wounded deer, bottom lip trembling perfectly on cue.

That's when I spotted the necklace glittering at her throat. The same one from his room.

My heart felt like someone had punched a hole through it. I actually started laughing—couldn't stop myself. What a complete joke I'd been.

I took a long sip of coffee to steady my voice:

""River, maybe spend less time crying and more time not being terrible at your job. Your campaign ideas are absolutely tragic.""

Her waterworks kicked into overdrive as she shrieked:

""You're just jealous because I'm young and gorgeous! You're trying to ruin my life!""

Then she stormed out, slamming the door so hard the whole office shook.

Suddenly everyone was covering their mouths, whispering and side-eyeing me like I'd just kicked a puppy.

Jake's face went dark: ""Moe, you're really disappointing me right now.""

And just like that, he bolted after her.

I clenched my fists, shut my door, and buried every emotion deep down while I got back to work.

Right before five, River posted in the group chat about her birthday dinner tonight—her treat, everyone welcome.

The chat exploded with ""Happy birthday!"" messages. Jake sent ninety-nine of them. I counted.

All the tears I'd been holding back finally came crashing down, hitting my paperwork like fat raindrops.

Jake texted me:

[River doesn't have a ride. Gonna drop her off at the restaurant. Just head home without me.]

I typed and deleted a message like ten times before finally hitting send.

One last roll of the dice.

[It's my birthday too, you know.]

Five whole minutes passed before he responded:

[Sorry. If you'd mentioned it earlier I totally would've done something, but I already promised River.]

[What do you want? I'll grab you something on my way back.]

I pulled up the blinds and watched our whole team parade out with River at the center like some kind of queen bee.

Jake stood next to her grinning like a fool, holding this massive bouquet of roses and a bunch of fancy gift bags.

They looked like the perfect couple getting showered with congratulations.

Meanwhile, I was hiding in the shadows like some dirty secret.

[Don't worry about it. I'll just grab something myself.]

I waited until the lobby was completely empty before wiping my eyes and heading home.

Sitting there with those divorce papers in my lap, this awful bitter feeling settled in my heart.

I figured I'd wait for Jake to get back so we could talk about splitting up.

Instead, River showed up at my door.

""She got cornered by some creep right outside her place. I had no choice but to bring her back here.""

""Poor kid just graduated—she can't afford anything safe. Let's just let her crash with us for a while.""

I leaned against the doorframe, saying nothing, just watching River sob into his arms like some wounded bird.

""When did you become so petty?"" Jake snapped, letting out this bitter laugh. ""Oh right, someone like you would never deal with this kind of sh//it. Can't relate, huh?""

I turned around and shut the door behind me.

Thing is, I was broke when I first graduated too. Lived in this sketchy neighborhood where rent was dirt cheap.

Total war zone—dealers, addicts, you name it. Two people got murdered there in one month.

Every night after work, I'd grip a box cutter in my pocket just to make it upstairs alive.

Even being that careful, some psycho still picked my lock one night.

Lucky for me, I had nightmares all the time and kept scissors under my pillow. That's the only reason I didn't get rap//ed or worse.

Predators don't care what you look like when they want to hurt you.

I could hear Jake's voice through the wall, all soft and gentle as he comforted River.

It reminded me of three years ago when he used to talk to me like that.

During that crazy flood—once-in-a-century storm that trapped me in the underground garage.

Water was up to my neck, bodies floating past me. I was screaming for help, choking on nasty floodwater.

Right when I thought I was done for, Jake appeared out of nowhere and grabbed my hand, dragging us both toward higher ground.

""Hang on! We're gonna make it out of this!""

But I was totally spent. He kept falling trying to pull me along.

I was crying, telling him: ""Just go! Leave me here!""

He wouldn't listen. Gritted his teeth and hauled me onto his back.

""Moe, if we die, we die together.""

After we made it out, I completely lost it, sobbing in his arms right there on the street. He just smiled and said:

""Guess we're ride-or-die now.""

That's how we ended up together. Dating, then married.

Funny thing is, looking back, I don't think Jake ever actually said he loved me.

River was sleeping in his room—the same room he never let me into anymore.

When I opened my bedroom door, he was sitting on the couch like he'd been waiting forever.

""River's pretty shaken up. She needs someone with her.""

""She's not comfortable around you, and you know I can't sleep in strange places,"" he said, hesitating. ""So... could you maybe grab a hotel room tonight?""

Logical and completely insane at the same time.

I stared at him, my throat tight: ""Sure.""

I left the signed divorce papers on the table and quickly packed my stuff.

On my way out, Jake was in the kitchen making River some honey tea.

Watching the steam rise from the mug, I smiled this empty smile and couldn't help myself:

""You need to use warm water, not hot.""

He had this ""duh"" moment and dumped out the scalding water, muttering thanks without even looking at me.

You're welcome, I thought.

Three years of marriage, and he'd never cooked me a single meal or made me one cup of honey tea.

Guess the difference between love and obligation is pretty obvious.

When he carried the mug back to the bedroom, he noticed my suitcase.

""You're taking a lot of stuff.""

""I need to take care of River, so I won't walk you out.""

I glanced at the pitch-black night outside and nodded like I understood.

I waited in that hotel room for hours. Jake never called—probably too busy playing nurse.

Which meant he never saw those divorce papers.

Next afternoon, passing by the break room, I caught some office gossip.

""They're totally hooking up. And living together now.""

""I've been shipping them forever. That necklace River's wearing? Jake bought it. I looked it up—like fifteen grand.""

""Someone saw them making out at her birthday party last night.""

Rain started pounding against the windows, and my ch//est felt like someone was squeezing my heart until it burst.

I stumbled back to my office, shaking uncontrollably.

That flood left me with serious PTSD. Heavy rain still sends me into complete panic mode.

Ten minutes later, Jake rushed in and locked the door, pulling me into his arms.

""Hey, it's okay. Storm's almost over.""

He automatically reached for my anxiety meds in the desk drawer, but the bottle was empty.

""Hold tight, I'll grab your prescription.""

He never came back.

My assistant texted:

[River's having bad cramps. Jake took her to the ER and called in sick.]

I pressed my shaking hands flat on the desk and typed back: [Thanks.]

Rush hour traffic meant no Ubers, and I was too messed up to drive. So I just huddled in my office waiting.

Around eight, I finally got a ride. But I was so out of it, I forgot to change the address.

The driver dropped me off at my old place—the house was all lit up.

The moment I walked in, I heard sounds from the guest room. Sounds that made everything crystal clear.

I dragged myself down the hallway and saw two bodies tangled together, clothes scattered everywhere.

Turns out when pain hits that level, you just go numb.

River wasn't having cramps. And Jake definitely wasn't the cold, distant guy I'd been married to.",1,1749579995.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1l86abp,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1l86abp/how_to_get_hired_at_starbucks_a_guide/,How to Get Hired at Starbucks: A Guide,"There are always a lot of posts on here asking about applications, following up, the interview process, etc., so I wanted to write a semi-comprehensive guide to getting hired and what happens after that.

# Openings

I think the biggest mistake people make when applying is looking for job postings on the careers site and applying without checking if they're actually hiring. These postings are auto-refreshed every 90 days, and most Store Managers (SMs) don't bother taking them down. The majority of stores aren't actually hiring at all, but they all keep their postings up anyway.  
  
To confirm if a store is actually looking for people, give them a call or walk in and ask. You should be able to find their number on Google Maps.

The best time to apply is usually July and August. It's right before our busiest season (Fall) and lots of people are in school and tend to leave the company in late August/early September, so many more stores will have openings than say in January.

# Resume

Starbucks is a pretty common first job, they mean it when they say no experience necessary. Of course any experience helps, so try to include as much as you can. Even if it's just volunteering, it wouldn't hurt to add it in. If you really want to pad out your resume so it doesn't look so empty, feel free to include awards you've won or clubs you participated in. There are even things you can get certified for online for free. (I added that I'm a certified bear identifier through Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks. It's an online 15 question multiple-choice lol.)

# Applying

Once you've confirmed a store is actually hiring and you've written up your resume, just apply online through the site. Starbucks stopped taking paper applications 15+ years ago, you can't actually walk in and apply anymore. You could apply and then try to hand your resume in person to show initiative, but it's a shot in the dark if the SM is there, not busy, and how much they'd appreciate ([or not appreciate](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/uhevgb/comment/i7737kd/)) it.

The one thing they're looking for above all is availability. You can be wildly overqualified and give the best interview of your life, but if they're looking for an opener and you're only available past noon it's no dice. Your best bet is to open up your availability as much as possible, with complete open availability giving you the best shot. You can always change your availability after six months or express your preferences, if you get hired they should do their best to accommodate you.

# Following Up

If you applied and haven't heard anything, I would wait at least a week before following up to check on your application. If you applied on a Monday, two weeks. SMs are busy and most use their admin time on Monday. It's when schedules and payroll are due, so it's also the day they're most likely to be in the back and looking at applications.

The best time to call is specifically 10am-11:30am, or 1pm-3pm. I know most SMs like to schedule themselves in the middle of the day so they get to see the opening, mid, and closing shifts, which means they're usually in from somewhere like 8am-4:30pm. It varies from store to store, but many are still going to be busy with their morning rushes until 10, and after 11:30 people start coming in for lunch. At least at my store, the lunch rush usually ends at 1pm, and after 3pm our high school gets out so that rush starts, though this is obviously less of a factor now in the summer.

Once you do get the SM on the phone, just introduce yourself, tell them you applied online, and mention your availability and that you're very interested. They should let you know when you can expect to get an interview. My SM specifically kept delaying when I could get interviewed. They told me within the week, but it took calling five times and three months. Unfortunately, that was the only Starbucks anywhere near me, but if you have more within commuting distance you should have a much better chance of getting an interview.

# The Interview

Dress nicely, preferably in dress code (you can find it online), and approach it how you would approach any other interview. If you want specific tips, try and answer their situational questions in STAR format. STAR is an answering framework for behavioral questions. You describe a Situation, your Task, the Action you took, and the Result of your action.

It also helps if you browse this subreddit and know some of the initiatives they're pushing for. Don't be afraid to drop some buzz words. The dress code, under 4 minutes from order to hand-off, under 12 minutes for mobile orders, 90% internal promotions, the five key moments, etc.

A couple hours or the day after your interview, don't forget to send them a quick thank you, I know a lot of people appreciate that.  
  
Best of luck!

# Onboarding & First Sip (Orientation)

Congrats! If you're reading these sections that probably means you got the job.

Onboarding is really just you filling out a bunch of documents and passing a simple background check. The background check should only take a day or two, but if you fail it you can always appeal. It isn't something you should really worry about though unless you have a criminal history. As a side note, when you first open up the onboarding site it's going to show just a few tasks you can fill out. Once you get closer to your First Sip, you should see a couple dozen.

Your First Sip is a pretty basic orientation. Your SM will look at your I-9 documents, and you'll literally have a sip of coffee while they go over some things to expect and what your training will look like. You should also get your aprons and hat here!

# Training

Training is a two-week program. Truth be told, it's not very comprehensive, and you're probably going to be left with a lot of questions. The best thing you can do is take it in stride, and ask people as many questions as possible. The vast majority of people will be understanding and helpful with any questions you might have. They shouldn't be, but some people might also be annoyed if you ask too many questions. I promise you though they'll be more annoyed if you just guess how to do something.

Also please don't forget to advocate for yourself! Some stores have this weird culture problem where they won't let new people on bar until it's been months. This is understandable during peak and off-peak, but any other time, don't be afraid to ask your Shift Supervisor (SSV) for more bar time. You can't learn without practice!

For recipe and dating help, [sbuxdates.com](http://sbuxdates.com) is amazing. They have a cheat sheet too that has pretty much everything you might need to know. There are also some Quizlets floating around out there with all the drinks.

As a last little note, don't be afraid if you feel like you're slowing people down. It varies, but it can take people anywhere from 3-6 months to really get comfortable at everything here. It's normal to be a bit overwhelmed and confused at first, but you'll get it all with practice, I promise.

I hope this guide can help some people out. Good luck, you're going to do great!",7,1749579937.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

1l865kh,https://i.redd.it/aphokufh656f1.jpeg,My first apartment - Help me go big!,"Hey everyone! 

I just moved into my very first apartment — and the best part is, it’s mine, so I don’t have to worry about being rent-friendly. I’m going all in with bold, pop art, and maximalist vibes.

I already have a vision in my head, but I’m honestly not the best at turning it into reality. The more choices I see, the more overwhelmed I get — so I’m taking it slow and doing one piece at a time, just to see how it all comes together.

So far:
	•	I started with the sofa (Kivik) 
	•	I picked out the Andy Warhol artwork I really love
	•	The carpet and coffee table are totally not my style, but it was family’s so it was free and ok for now 😂

Right now I’m thinking about painting the walls and ceiling but I’m totally stuck on color. I feel like this step is going to define the whole space, so I want to be thoughtful before diving into smaller details like lighting or shelving.

I’d love advice on:
	•	Wall/ceiling color combos that work with pop art  or this Warhol energy
	•	Whether I should paint first or bring in more decor before committing
	•	How to keep bold choices feeling exciting without making the room chaotic and unmatchable 

If anyone has done something similar or has inspo pics, I’d love to see them. Thanks in advance!

My study table, my pet dog, coffee shots during the night, I absolutely loved preparing for this exam, and yeah it is way below par for everyone but yeah, after getting everything I want, I'm still actually a little sad about leaving. 

I guess it's because, everything's definitely gotta change after these 2 years, I'm never going to unemployed and sitting at home preparing (if I'm still unemployed, I need to sell my organs for the loan repayment) , probably won't get to stay at home for months together and it's feels so numb to leave home again. 

Being the second child of the home who always makes fun, who always messes things up, who always keeps everything lively, it was really so off during the dinner time, it was quiet, everyone were quiet including my pet lmao.

so I've been finding myself in somewhat if an interesting situation lately. After I graduated highschool I went on a gap year and met my bf. I felt very free, I had my first own room in a shared appartement and was aray from a toxic houshold. Honestly I had the time of my life. When I came together with my bf, it was honestly really nice, I never thought I could have romantic feelings and was very overwhelmed with the situation but I also really enjoyed it. We both come from different countries and visit each other regularly and also lived together for a while. After comming back, we have been doing long distance for about 2 years up to today. And even though I feel very lucky to have this relationship and be able to go to the other end of the world ans spend time with him and locals there, I still have this nagging feeling in the back of my head - what if I were single? I definitly would have more money, since I wouldnt have to periodically pay for plain tickets. I would feel more like my future is really mine, I wouldnt have to include anyone elses feelings into my considerations concerning my future. I could live in a small appartment wherever I manage to find a job, get a cat, decorate it exactly how I want, make it my personnal little paradise. I wouldnt look in the mirror and ask myself every now and then if I look good enough for my partner or if his attitude towards me was a bit fake in the moring or is it just me overthinking again? I could spend however much I want on art supplies, cloth, coffees whatever. I would have to answer to nones standards, justify nothing towards anyone, have that brownie without feeling bad that my partner wont have the perfectly lean gf when I decide to order it. I would live for none but me. I wuold have my depressive episodes without anyone worrying about me, without me having to pretend like I have energy just to compfort them for the times being. 
But then again, I wouldnt have anyone to be with. My appartment would be empty and quiet. In dark evernings, a sad lonelieness might creep up on me from the cold floors. I might hear the neighbours and their guests having a nice evening together, imagining the warm light flooding the foom and reflecting upon the delicious food on the big table. I might want to go on a trip, but finding the 20th reason why not to, and none would convince me to go. None would just be in the living room playing their games, the noises quietly pertruding my room with the half closed door. None would be there when I come back from work, and I would have none to warmly welcome home on a rainy day. I would have none carrying for me when Im sick and none to pemper when they need it. 
But again I wouldnt feel societys pressure to tie myself to them at some point, to get children, to stick together even though we need distance.

In the morning I have my coffee and then just drink water until it’s time to eat. I have never taken electrolytes and have only recently learned that that’s a thing. I’m wondering what I need to look out for in terms of not breaking my fast. Does it just have to be zero calories and have no sweeteners? Will electrolytes help with hunger? I’m kind of struggling with being super hungry during the day but I prefer to eat dinner with my family, and have my glass of wine in the evening. I have a family member who also does IF, and he will just drink water with some sea salt in it. Is that sufficient? I don’t even know what electrolytes are to be honest 😅

I live for those in-between moments—the smirk before the laugh, the glance that says everything, the kind of light that makes skin glow like it’s telling secrets.

Outside the frame? I’m your classic Irish rogue—tattooed, music loud enough to shake the walls, book in hand (probably with a half-drunk coffee beside it), and always up for an adventure, especially the kind that starts with “I probably shouldn’t…” and ends with a story worth retelling.

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.
