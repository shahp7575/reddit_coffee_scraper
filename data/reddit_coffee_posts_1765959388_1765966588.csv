Hi, I'm a student and currently in 3rd year of undergrad. So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a  just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

You can search for 'New delhi' or 'Mumbai' for example

1posvhy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1posvhy,Terrible experience at Coffee House," I know this is supposed to be cultural heritage but it really is just a crumbling old building selling nostalgia corn.

We went in, took a while to find an empty table, expected the gomgom type buzzing noise and second hand cigarette smoke so I’m not complaining about that. Thankfully it wasn’t too crowded so we sat and the white clad waiter immediately appeared with the menu. We told him to give us a few minutes to decide and he just stood there, kind of peer pressuring us into ordering immediately. So we ordered some stuff that you see in the pics, thought we were gonna sit there and discuss some stuff but the waiter pretty much immediately came back with the food.

The chowmein my friend took was average, pretty much what you get in roadside Hakka noodles. But the fish fry I took was absolute dogshit. The outside layer was hard as a rock, like they kept it in the fridge for days and just brought it out and heated it up in oil and served it. It barely had any fish inside, the little bit of fish there was was kind of dark in colour. I doubt how fresh it was and I can’t even tell what fish it was. The masala was too overpowering and it was simply too spicy even for me. They couldn’t even serve mineral water and the cold coffee my friend ordered later was just room temperature coffee with ice cubes in it.

Now that’s not even the worst part. Even before we finished our food the waiter kept appearing like every two minutes pestering us to pay the bill. We told him we are not going anywhere and we will pay the bill after we are done eating. He pretty much forced it, like he has a plane to catch or something, so we paid the bill even before we were done with half the food. And it’s not even like we were sitting for hours, it was probably less than 15 minutes from sitting down.

Once we paid the bill, the waiter kept coming back and checking if we wanted to order something more. We probably would have honestly if he didn’t force us to pay the bill, but we were already pretty irritated. I also noticed they were doing this with almost every young person there and straight up bad mouthing them like they are doing us some huge favour by serving food. Eventually the dude came back and straight up asked us to empty the table if we were done ordering. Note that I still hadn’t finished my food by then. My friend told him there are literally so many empty tables anyway, it’s not like we were occupying someone else’s place, but he said we need to order something.

I didn’t finish the food and neither did my friend. We just left. Overall, absolute garbage food with absolutely terrible hospitality. I had a similar experience three years back and I see that it has only gotten worse.",3,1765965933.0,kolkata,3,1.0,False

I’ve reached a breaking point. For the last few years, I’ve been a ""manual"" guy—using a semi-automatic machine, a dedicated grinder, unpressurized baskets, precision tampers, the whole deal.

While I love the quality of the shots, I’m honestly just tired of the workflow, the mess, and the time it takes every morning. I’m ready to trade a bit of ""perfection"" for the convenience of pressing a single button.

**My situation:**

* **Budget:** Under €500.
* **Habits:** 90% of the time I drink single shot without milk.
* **Milk:** Only occasionally when guests come over.

**Two main questions for the experts here:**

1. **Which machine would you recommend in this price range?** I’ve been looking at the Gaggia Anima or some of the Philips/DeLonghi entry-level models, but I’d love to hear your experience regarding reliability and espresso quality.
2. **Milk system vs. External frother?** Since I rarely drink milk, I’m debating whether to get a machine with a built-in milk carafe (like the LatteGo) or just get a solid ""coffee-only"" machine and use a separate Lidl-style milk frother when guests visit. Does skipping the milk system on the machine usually mean better internal components for the coffee itself at this price point?

Thanks in advance for helping me make the switch to the ""lazy side""!",1,1765965920.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1posstw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1posstw,Review of 3 products and my experience,"1. Amul Kesar Milkshake: Bought for Rs 600 for pack of 32 at 50% off. Thanks to this sub for timely update. Taste is like Kesar-Kulfi type. Good product, especially with the discount. Consistency is good and not at all lumpy, taste better when cooled.


2. Amul Coffee Milkshake: Bought for Rs 960 for pack of 32, at 20% off. Taste is like Kopiko toffee. Consistency is good. Tastes better when cooled.

3. Amul Protein Lassi (unflavored). Very Important to shake really well before use. Usually the consistency must be liquid enough to pass through the straw. But 1 of the packs was lumpy, I had to cut open the box, and when it forms those chunks, it might get a little weird to consume. Taste is fine, (I have sweet tooth), but yet I could have it with no problem in the taste. Really Good value for the amount of proteins. Tastes better when cooled. Remember to shake it hard.


Delivery: All 3 ordered from official website. I got both Amazon courier and Delhivery courier service for different products. Here's me review for the same:

Amazon Courier: Delivered it timely within the expected delivery date. Hassle free.

Delhivery courier: It was a little trouble some. Though I received the parcel in 12 days time, they had kept shifting the delivery date, and even once mentioned ""out for delivery"" but it was even attempted that day. Had raised concern tickets on both the courier app, and also Amul customer service, both responded that it is in progress and will reach asap.

IMO the service of the courier agent varies based on your location, as I saw some posts where Amazon was better, and other posts where Delhivery was better.

Packaging: Was very good. Came with proper box, and no spills or tamper.

Every so often my grandmother would come to visit from another state and just take up residence with me and my mom for however long she decided to stay. No warning, just show up with some bags and let us know she was here to help. 

My mom worked for a hospital chain and was pretty well traveled and often I was left to fend for myself for a day or two which was not a big deal I was 16 at the time and my dad lived maybe 20 minutes away, but if grandma found out mom was going to be gone she would immediately appear to “watch the house and chaperone.” 

So it’s one of those times my mom is gone and it’s just me and grandma and I was a little extra put out by the intrusion in my house. Earlier that month one of my family members had found out I had come out and they proceeded to share this news with several other relatives who had no business knowing my business. My grandma was very very religious and I didn’t know for sure if she has heard anything. 

So one morning I am in the kitchen trying to figure out what I want for breakfast and grandma walks in and asks what I’m doing. I said “Trying to decide if I want cereal or just coffee.” Grandma suddenly gives me a very serious look and says “Some people find a cereal that is right for them and they have it every day faithfully for the rest of their lives. Some people struggle to find a cereal that is to their taste and they start to think they don’t like cereal at all. When really they just need to go out and try different kinds of cereals until they find the one cereal they are happy with for the rest of their lives. It’s just really important to not just give up on cereal all together.” 

And then she just walked away and never mentioned it again. ",2,1765965497.0,comingout,0,1.0,False

I’ll be here for at least 6 months, and I’m currently looking for a job, so I’m slowly settling into life here.

I’m looking for genuine, long-term friends — nothing intense, just people to grab a coffee, check out cafés, go on short trips, or hang out and talk sometimes.

About me:
I like staying active and trying new things. I enjoy language study, running, hiking, gym workouts, kickboxing, and on the chill side movies, hip-hop music, reading, makeup, and drawing.
I’m pretty easygoing, positive, and open, and I connect best with people who enjoy doing things and sharing everyday moments rather than just texting.

I’m hoping to meet friends in their mid-20s to 30s — it’s simply easier for me to connect and have natural conversations within a similar age range. Thanks for understanding 🙂

If you message me, please keep it simple and tell me:
	•	your nationality
	•	age
	•	what you’re currently doing (work/study)
	•	your Instagram (if you’re comfortable)

Looking forward to hearing from you 🌿

When I laid my eyes on her I thought to myself “okay she’s cute I kinda wanna talk to her” so I did. Fast forward two weeks later she comes in class pretty sad and it looked like she was crying I sat beside and asked her what’s wrong and told her that we’d go and have a cup of coffee and discuss why she’s this sad and we did. This was the first time us meeting outside of class. She told me the reason she was sad is because a guy (turns out to be her ex or currently dating still) caught her walking around in uni wearing a “slutty” outfit I guess? So obviously I comforted her and I admitted to her that I was into her and wanted to talk to her on a deeper level she replied saying “yea I feel better and good and happy whenever I’m around you” I got her number and we started chatting normally then about 2 weeks later she suddenly starts replying less and less. I was confused so I confronted her about it she gave me the “ I’m dealing with a lot of problems at my home and a lot of work issues” I was like okay it’s fine take your time to reply but let me know beforehand if you’re dealing with stuff like that. News flash she still was taking too long to reply,because I like this girl a lot I confronted her once again about the same topic and she told me that she’s not ready to take anything serious and she “just got out of a relationship” and I insisted to know if she was letting me off easily or she genuinely can’t and obviously she said she actually can’t. Fast forward around a month I peek through the class window and I see that girl walking down the campus with a dude and seemed like they were just talking but then that guy reaches in for a hug but that girl then lowers his hands basically not letting him do that. At that point I was mad as fuck because I’m pretty sure this guy was the same one that argued with her about her style.

Until yesterday.

When “the time came,” he handed me a silver key. I asked him, “What happened to the golden key? Did you lose it and give me the spare?”

He told me that this was the key, that it was never gold.

I asked again, saying he must not remember well. He insisted that it was always this key, that I’m the one misremembering. He’s been working there for 33 years, and according to him, it has always been this exact key. There is no spare key either.

On the way to the restroom, I kept staring at it, kind of “playing” with the way the silver reflected the light, wondering if I had fooled myself all this time. Maybe the lighting in the parking garage hit it in a way that made it look gold before?

I'd like to announce a casting for the main female role in a long-length series titled ""**Happy...Adventerous Relationship/Family**"".

The action takes place in middle-size charming ""gem"" located next to the popular ski resorts & Karkonosze mountain range called Jelenia Góra-the place of permanent residence of the ""director"" ;)  and at the same time one of the two main characters & in your place.

The characters believe that it is possible to form a valuable relationship between two people who love each other and treat life as an interesting adventure.

They go through subsequent stages of acquaintance, starting from camaraderie, through friendship, which finally turns into mature & conscious love.

The plot is full of twists and turns, but above all it is a story about the relationship of **two whole halves** who do not look for fulfillment in the other person, but someone who, by inspiring and influencing each other, will allow another one to reach the next level of maturity. It is the creation of a new valuable chapter in both of their lives.

***The director;) planned to make 5 seasons of the series*****:**

•Season 1 “They talk and discover each other.”

•Season 2 ""Bicycle trip around Poland & your country"".

•Season 3 ""Bicycle tour through the World...in stages...adjusted to my & your job""

•Season 4 (if both want it): ""Birth of a child and upbringing in curiosity and acceptance of the surrounding world"" and who knows... maybe a repetition of Season 2 or 3 in an enlarged ""team""

•Season 5 ""They live happily ever after"" without forgetting that life is not only eternal idyll, but also challenges that must be faced together and constant learning and discovery.

***This is the role for you if:***

•your contract with your previous ""employer"" ;)  was effectively terminated and the ""notice period""  has expired

•you are looking for a unique, dynamic workplace where there is no room for boredom and the director tries to treat every day as one micro-life, and at the same time you also take the initiative to spend time together

•you are open to the world and people

• you can draw conclusions and strive for compromise,

•you don't have any addictions,

•you have a sense of humor and self-distance,

•empathy, truth, helping other people, honesty are values that are familiar for you

• you are active. You play sports and like sport & think that weekend spent cycling or hiking is a perfect idea for an active rest

• during so-called ""lazy time"" you like to listen to an interesting podcast, read a book, watch an ambitious movie, go for a walk... so that we can also ""rub our brains""

•your ""fuel"" is among others: curiosity about the world and people; you draw energy from a newly discovered bicycle/hiking route, you're a person for whom talking to a new person or trying/cooking a new dish is also a micro-adventure. In other words, who values the quality of time spent.

•In addition to ""nutrition for mind and body"", you also value food for your stomach. I'm a ""foodie""; I like good food (although it doesn't show on me, because I burn it faster than I consume it) and I also cook myself. I believe that good food is also a ""carrier of feelings"" between people and I like to cook together from time to time.

***What benefits await for you?***

•stable employment - after a positive trial period , an employment contract for an indefinite period

• attractive, extensive motivational system: bicycle trips, mountain hikes, watching movies together, reciprocating your commitment through regular dates and not only during the period of getting to know each other, conversations, pancakes or home-made dinner

•keeping spirits up in bad times and helping hand in solving problems

• cooperation with a reader of general and child psychology (because preparation for potential family begins with awareness and knowledge)

•work in a relaxed atmosphere featuring music hits from the '70s, '80s and '90s

•private medical care - if you catch a cold, I will make you a cup of warm tea and go to the pharmacy for medicine (if home methods fail)

•freshly ground coffee and homemade cheesecake

•a place for your two-wheeler in a safe haven, i.e. in the so-called ""The Men's Den""  garage)

In formal terms, the main male character is 188 cm tall, has a sporty figure, higher education, ""clean slate"" (no ex-wifes, kids etc.) and is fully independent. Has been ""on his own"" for a long time (no mortgage, credits etc.). Cash is a KING. Plus bonds.

It would be nice if you also worked 100% remotely (though of course this is not a ""condition""), because then we could travel & work together at least partially.

If you decide to write to me I'd like to read also an extended message about yourself etc.

Logistically of course Europe is a natural choice however I do not exclude ""continental relationships"" **if you're also working 100% remote.** Never say never ! 

Feel free to contact via PM if you think we might get along well.

Thank you for attention.

But then i start thinking about it and im thinking, all this work that is going into getting into these trackers its so much work for me and for what some hard to find music that i HAVE to seed for the next 72 hours, i started pirating stuff because i was sick of following all the rules that spotify, Netflix, steam etc was putting in place for as, but im like im going from following a big company's rules to following a small community's that some could probable almost be a cults rules piracy to me and many more means freedom from big company's but i dont want to take that freedom i got from leaving big tech and give it to a smaller big tech.

1pose8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1pose8e/building_a_personal_meeting_scheduler_mcp_for/,Building a Personal Meeting Scheduler MCP for Mistral Le Chat,"# TL;DR

I built a small MCP server that helps me schedule meetings *via email* without sending booking links.

* It can **search emails**, **find free slots** from a YAML calendar, and **save a threaded reply as a draft** (plus block the slot).
* It runs locally; if you use a cloud chat client (like Mistral Le Chat), you connect via a tunnel (treat that URL like a secret).

# The Problem: Scheduling Feels Broken

You know that moment? Someone important emails you. A potential client. A former mentor. An industry contact you've been meaning to reconnect with. They want to meet.

Your instinct says: *be personal, be human*. But then you remember you have a Calendly link. And suddenly you're wondering if sending ""here's my scheduling link"" feels... kind of cold?

It does. I've been on the receiving end. Nothing says ""you're in my queue"" quite like an automated booking page.

**The Calendly problem isn't Calendly.** Tools like Calendly and Cal.com are fantastic for high-volume scheduling. Sales calls, support meetings, recurring office hours. But for the people who *matter*, those links feel transactional. Your lead doesn't want to pick a slot from a menu. Your potential partner doesn't want to feel like ticket #47. You wouldn't hand a business card to your grandmother.

So you do it manually. And that's where the real pain begins.

**Manual scheduling is death by a thousand tabs.** Check email for context. Open calendar to find free slots. Switch back to compose a response. Realize you forgot the timezone. Check calendar again. Copy-paste times. Send. Wait. Repeat when they counter-propose.

By the time you've scheduled a 30-minute coffee chat, you've spent 15 minutes playing air traffic controller.

There has to be a middle ground.

# The Solution: What If Your Chat Could Just... Handle It?

So here's what I built instead: an AI assistant that reads your email, knows your calendar, and writes personalized replies. No booking links. No tab-switching. Just conversation.

I built an MCP server that does exactly this. MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI assistants call external tools. In this case: tools that talk to your email and calendar.

Trust boundary, in plain terms:

* The MCP server runs locally on your machine.
* If your chat client runs in the cloud, you expose the MCP endpoint through a tunnel (e.g. ngrok).
* The chat client calls your tools through that tunnel URL.

So the plumbing runs locally; the only thing you expose is the MCP endpoint (via the tunnel).

https://preview.redd.it/vo6tebemhq7g1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=692db5006543c035d4237a8135f5545d89ffff02

Here's what the workflow looks like:  


Three tools. Three steps. No database to configure. Just IMAP credentials and a YAML file.

If you don't want to read a diagram, the workflow is simply:

1. Search the relevant email.
2. Compute free slots from your YAML schedule (minus holidays + blocked slots).
3. Save a threaded reply as a draft and block the chosen slot.

The draft sits in your Drafts folder until you review and hit send. Your reply lands in the original email thread (proper `In-Reply-To` headers). Lisa sees a personal response, not a booking confirmation from a robot.

That's it.

Let's look at what makes this work.

# The Building Blocks

The stack is minimal. Here's each piece.

**Python + FastMCP.** FastMCP handles the MCP protocol plumbing. You define tools as plain Python functions, then register them on a FastMCP instance:

    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    mcp = FastMCP(
        name=""Meeting Scheduler"",
        instructions=""A meeting scheduler that searches emails and manages calendar slots."",
    )
    
    from meeting_scheduler_mcp.tools import get_free_slots
    
    mcp.tool(get_free_slots)

Three tools, registered on one FastMCP instance. The server starts with one line:

    mcp.run(transport=""streamable-http"", host=""0.0.0.0"", port=8000)

**YAML for calendar storage.** No database. No Google Calendar API. Just a file (I wanted something I could diff and edit quickly):

    schedule:
      timezone: Europe/Berlin
      slot_duration: 30
      holidays: DE
      weekly:
        - days: [""mon"", ""tue"", ""wed"", ""thu"", ""fri""]
          slots:
            - start: ""09:00""
              end: ""12:00""
            - start: ""13:00""
              end: ""17:00""
    blocked:
      - datetime: ""2025-01-15T14:00:00+01:00""
        duration: 60
        reason: ""Meeting with Lisa""

The `holidays: DE` flag filters out German public holidays automatically. I live in Germany, so that's what I built. Adding other countries means extending one file.

**IMAP for email.** I use Python's `imaplib`. Depending on your provider, you can often use IMAP with an app password (instead of building OAuth + token refresh). Some providers require OAuth or have extra restrictions:

    IMAP_HOST=imap.example.com
    IMAP_USER=you@example.com
    IMAP_PASSWORD=your_app_password

The server reads emails and extracts threading headers (`Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, `References`). When you reply to a meeting request, the response lands in the same thread. Your email client never knows an MCP server was involved.

**HTTP/SSE transport.** FastMCP's `streamable-http` mode handles Server-Sent Events. Mistral Le Chat connects, calls tools, streams responses. Zero networking code on your end.

No accounts to create. No services to configure. One server, one job.

Now let's walk through each tool—one for each step in the workflow.

# Three Tools the LLM Can Call

These are the three tools I ended up with. Each one does exactly one thing.

# search_emails

The LLM searches your mailbox—by sender, subject, date, unread status. It gets back the email content plus threading headers:

    [
      {
        ""id"": ""42"",
        ""subject"": ""Meeting Thursday?"",
        ""from"": ""lisa@example.com"",
        ""to"": ""you@example.com"",
        ""date"": ""2025-01-15"",
        ""message_id"": ""<abc123@example.com>"",
        ""in_reply_to"": """",
        ""references"": """",
        ""body"": ""Hey, can we meet this week?""
      }
    ]

That `message_id` matters later. The LLM passes it to the draft tool, and your reply threads correctly in Lisa's inbox.

# get_free_slots

The LLM asks for your availability. It gets back a filtered list—holidays excluded, past times gone, blocked slots removed:

    [
      {
        ""date"": ""2025-01-16"",
        ""start"": ""09:00"",
        ""end"": ""09:30"",
        ""timezone"": ""Europe/Berlin""
      },
      {
        ""date"": ""2025-01-16"",
        ""start"": ""09:30"",
        ""end"": ""10:00"",
        ""timezone"": ""Europe/Berlin""
      }
    ]

A 2-hour minimum notice is baked in. The LLM can't offer a slot starting in 10 minutes.

# save_draft_and_block_slot

The LLM confirms the meeting. One tool call, two operations:

    {
      ""datetime"": ""2025-01-16T09:00:00+01:00"",
      ""duration"": 30,
      ""reason"": ""Meeting with Lisa"",
      ""subject"": ""Re: Meeting Thursday?"",
      ""body"": ""Thursday 9am works. See you then!"",
      ""to"": ""lisa@example.com"",
      ""in_reply_to"": ""<abc123@example.com>""
    }

Calendar blocked. Draft saved. If something fails, the tool returns an error. Worst case, you undo the partial change (delete the blocked slot or discard the draft) and retry.

The draft sits in your Drafts folder. You review it, tweak if needed, send when ready.

That's what the LLM has to work with. Here's what a conversation looks like.

# What This Looks Like

It's Monday evening. You're wrapping up, and you remember Daniel emailed about that collaboration you discussed back in August. You don't want to dig through your inbox. So you ask:

**You:** What are my unseen emails?

**Le Chat:** You have one new email:

|From|Subject|
|:-|:-|
|Daniel|Follow-Up on Potential Collaboration|

*""Hi, I'm now available to move forward with our collaboration discussions. Would you be interested in a quick call in the next two weeks?""*

Good timing. You want to respond while it's fresh, but you're not opening your calendar app.

**You:** Check for a slot tomorrow afternoon.

**Le Chat:** Here's tomorrow afternoon:

|Time|
|:-|
|13:00–13:30|13:30–14:00|
|14:00–14:30|14:30–15:00|
|15:00–15:30|15:30–16:00|
|16:00–16:30|16:30–17:00|

You don't want to commit to one slot—Daniel might have constraints. Offer options.

**You:** Pick a slot right after lunch. Draft a reply with the suggestion.

**Le Chat:** Here's a draft:

>Hi Daniel,

Want me to save this as a draft?

**You:** Yes, save it.

**Le Chat:** Draft saved. I've blocked 13:30–14:00 on your calendar. If Daniel can't make it, let me know and I'll find another slot.

Three minutes. The draft threads correctly under Daniel's original email—sitting in your Drafts folder, waiting for your review. The calendar holds one slot while you wait for his reply.

No tab-switching. No copy-pasting times. Just a conversation.

Here's how to set it up.

# Setting It Up

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/seb-schulz/meeting-scheduler-mcp.git
    cd meeting-scheduler-mcp
    uv sync

Copy the example environment file and add your IMAP credentials:

    cp .env.example .env

    IMAP_HOST=imap.your-provider.com
    IMAP_USER=you@example.com
    IMAP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
    IMAP_FROM=you@example.com

Most hosting providers give you these credentials in their email settings panel. If you're on a big provider with 2FA, you may need an app password instead of your regular one.

Start the server:

    uv run python -m meeting_scheduler_mcp

The default `calendar.yaml` defines your availability:

    schedule:
      timezone: Europe/Berlin
      slot_duration: 30
      holidays: DE
      weekly:
        - days: [""mon"", ""tue"", ""wed"", ""thu"", ""fri""]
          slots:
            - start: ""09:00""
              end: ""12:00""
            - start: ""13:00""
              end: ""17:00""

Edit this to match when you're actually free. Le Chat can only offer slots that exist in this file.

Le Chat runs in the cloud, so it can't reach your localhost. The simple mental model is:

* MCP server runs locally.
* ngrok exposes it as a public HTTPS endpoint.
* Le Chat calls your tools through that endpoint.

Use ngrok to bridge the gap:

    ngrok http 8000

Copy that URL (`https://abc123def456.ngrok.io`). That's your public endpoint. Keep this terminal running.

Security notes (keep it boring):

* Treat the tunnel URL like a secret.
* Prefer an app password (not your primary mailbox password).
* Consider using a dedicated mailbox while testing.

# Connect to Mistral Le Chat

1. Open [Mistral Le Chat](https://chat.mistral.ai)
2. Click **Intelligence** (top left) → **Connectors**
3. Click **+ Add Connector** (right side)
4. Select **Custom MCP Server**
5. Paste your ngrok URL: `https://abc123def456.ngrok.io/mcp`
6. Name it: `Meeting-Scheduler`
7. Click **Connect**

Mistral fetches your three tools. They appear in the chat interface immediately.

If it runs, you're done. If not, the next section covers the common stumbling blocks.

# What Tripped Me Up

The MCP part? Straightforward. Everything around it? Less so.

This is a tiny app. Three tools, a YAML file, some IMAP calls. Here's where it got messy.

# IMAP Folder Names

First test run. ""Draft saved."" I open my inbox. Nothing. Check Sent. Nothing. Refresh. Still nothing.

Eventually I find it in `INBOX.Drafts`. Not `Drafts`. My mail server uses a dot-separated hierarchy, so all folders live under INBOX.

Gmail does its own thing: `[Gmail]/Drafts`. Other servers just use `Drafts`. IMAP silently accepts whatever folder name you give it. If the folder doesn't exist, some servers create it, others fail without telling you.

Check your mail client for the actual folder name, then set `IMAP_DRAFT_FOLDER` in your `.env` to match.

# Email Threading

I send a test reply. It shows up as a new conversation instead of threading under the original.

Email clients group messages by looking at hidden headers that point back to earlier messages. I was setting these headers, but I took a shortcut: only referencing the immediate parent message, not the full chain. Works fine for one or two replies. After more back-and-forth, some clients lose track.

I left it. For scheduling, you rarely go beyond two or three messages anyway.

# Timezones

I knew better than to touch this one.

Timezones, daylight saving transitions, recurring events. Every calendar app that ""does it right"" has a team maintaining edge cases. I didn't want to be that team.

The calendar uses local time. `Europe/Berlin` in my case. If someone in California looks at my slots, they see Berlin time. For a personal scheduler on my own machine, that's fine. If you need multi-timezone support, you'll need to extend this.

# SSL/TLS

Your IMAP password travels over the network. Encryption is not optional.

I started with port 143, got a connection error, switched to 993, and it worked. The difference: 993 encrypts immediately, 143 tries to upgrade mid-connection. Most providers expect 993. If you see strange handshake errors, check your port first.

# Provider Authentication

Whether IMAP is ""easy"" depends entirely on your provider.

* Many classic providers let you use IMAP with an app password (especially if you have 2FA enabled).
* Some providers require OAuth 2.0 (which means client registration + token refresh).

I tested with a non-Gmail provider. If you're on Gmail specifically, you may be able to use an app password; otherwise, OAuth is the more complex but more general route.

# Testing

I wanted to write tests. Then I searched for ""IMAP test server"" and found... not much.

There's no standard, easy-to-spin-up IMAP server for local testing. I ended up building a devcontainer with docker-compose that runs a small mail server. It works, but it took longer to set up than the actual MCP code.

If you're extending this, plan for that. The test infrastructure is its own project.

These were the rough edges. Next: what I deliberately chose not to build.

# Limitations (By Design)

Every feature I didn't build is a feature I don't have to maintain. Not a TODO list. Just lines I chose not to cross.

# No Conflict Detection

Book two meetings at 2pm? The calendar won't stop you. In v1, that's manual by design: you review the draft before sending, and if there's a conflict you pick a different slot. Conflict resolution means state, edge cases, and UI for ""which meeting wins?"" Not worth it here.

# No Slot Status

No ""blocked"" vs ""confirmed"" states. A slot exists or it doesn't. One line in YAML, one meaning.

# Drafts Only

The server never sends emails. It saves drafts. You review, you click send. No accidental emails to the wrong person at 3am.

# No Summary or Reminder

No follow-up email after booking. No calendar invite. One request, one draft, done.

# No Multi-Slot Booking

""Book Tuesday and Thursday"" requires parsing compound requests. One slot per action keeps the logic obvious.

# No Recurring Slots

""Every Tuesday at 2pm"" needs a rules engine and date math. YAML stays flat: each slot is a line you can read.

These limits are what keep the setup simple.

# Try It Yourself

That's the whole thing. I thought it would take one afternoon. The MCP code? One afternoon. Connecting it to real email infrastructure? That's where the second afternoon began.

If you want to try it: [seb-schulz/meeting-scheduler-mcp](https://github.com/seb-schulz/meeting-scheduler-mcp)

Three commands, one config file. The scheduler works. The rough edges are the same ones every MCP server hits when it leaves the sandbox and touches production systems.

If you hit the limitations, you know exactly where to extend. No abstraction layers. No framework magic. Just code you can read.

1posdnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDermGlycineCure/comments/1posdnw/what_foods_decrease_glycine_levels_in_the_body/,What foods decrease Glycine levels in the body,"How glycine levels can be indirectly affected

1. Very high methionine intake without enough glycine

Foods very high in methionine can increase the body’s demand for glycine because glycine is used to buffer methylation by-products.

High-methionine foods include:

	•	Muscle meats (beef, chicken breast, pork)

	•	Fish

	•	Eggs

	•	Hard cheeses

👉 These foods don’t remove glycine, but if eaten heavily without collagen-rich foods, glycine may be used up faster.

⸻

2. Low intake of glycine-rich foods

If the diet lacks glycine sources, blood levels may trend lower over time.

Low-glycine dietary patterns:

	•	Muscle-meat–only diets

	•	Very low-protein or poorly balanced vegan diets (unless legumes/seeds are sufficient)

⸻

3. High intake of competing amino acids

Large amounts of:

	•	Leucine

	•	Valine

	•	Isoleucine (BCAAs)

These can shift amino acid metabolism, sometimes reducing glycine availability for non-protein roles (sleep, collagen synthesis, detox).

Common sources:

	•	Whey protein isolates

	•	BCAA supplements

	•	Heavy reliance on lean meats

⸻

4. High fructose or alcohol intake

Not foods that “remove” glycine, but they:

	•	Increase liver detox demand

	•	Increase glutathione use (which requires glycine)

Chronic intake may increase glycine demand.

⸻

5. Gut inflammation or malabsorption

This reduces amino acid absorption overall, including glycine.

⸻

What doesn’t lower glycine

	•	Sugar

	•	Fat

	•	Vegetables

	•	Coffee or tea

	•	Salt

None directly reduce glycine levels.

⸻

Practical takeaway

Rather than avoiding foods, focus on glycine balance:

✔ Include glycine-rich foods:

	•	Gelatin, collagen

	•	Bone broth

	•	Skin-on meats

	•	Tendons, slow-cooked cuts

✔ Balance muscle meat with collagen sources

✔ Avoid chronic overuse of isolated BCAA supplements",1,1765963994.0,SebDermGlycineCure,0,1.0,False

We had a coffee “date”. which went really well, I liked him all the way through the date and afterwards which is a first for me. however, the date lasted somewhere between 40-55 minutes which is fine. the coffee shop closed 45 ish minutes after we got there and after he walked me back to my dorm and we didnt know what else to do, we just met and were kind if awkward but not in a bad way lol. so we went our separate ways for the evening. a few days later, i am back home. i still have an important project due for a class that i was working on remotely but taking a short break to eat dinner and we are texting just abt how our days went. he said he wants to face time and before i have a chance to say no, he facetimes me but i decline because i need to focus on eating and getting back to my project. we have also never facetimed before and am someone who usually needs a solid warning before a ft call. he says “damn, guess i gotta get a new gf”. my jaw was on the ground and i sent an 🙄 emoji. i was jokingly offended but not really when he said he needs a new gf after i didnt answer his facetime but we usually joke like that. but we are also not bf and gf. we have never discussed this and though i really like him and feel like he checks most if not all of my top 5 boxes, i feel like we are not at the point where we should call our selves bf and gf for many reasons. 
1) he never talked about this label with me and i believe that should be a conversation and a mutual decision not something he kind of randomly decides and mentions. 
2) i feel like i dont know him to well. i dont know basic things like his last name, we dont follow eachother on social media 
3) he did not pay for my coffee at the coffee shop, he just pointed to the counter and said “you can go order your coffee over there”. we also had no physical interaction other than a quick hug hello and goodbye. i am ok with this but i had no way of knowing for sure if it was an actual date or if we were just hanging out. and if he was my boyfriend i would prefer he pays for my coffee which he didnt. that is fine because we arent dating. 
4) he vapes which i didnt know until he pulled it out on our way to my dorm. i try not to judge but for a relationship i do not want my partner to vape or do drugs because of family stuff and just in general men im interested in give me the ick when i learn they smoke or vape. he asked me abt drug and alcohol usage. i told him i drink sometimes in social situations but that is it, no drugs, weed or smoking. he said same… as he was vaping. 
5) i am still on hinge, talking to other guys, and the friday before i left for break, 2 days after we saw eachother, i went to a party and i was talking to guys and did not think anything of it or of him, not to be mean. but i genuinely am under the impression that i am single, which i am and that he is a guy i am interested in but we are not at a serious/exclusive stage we are still in the talking, getting to know each other. 
6) my winter break is around 6 ish weeks, which he knows, so if we were bf and gf and are in different states it would be a weird time to begin a relationship. 
i have never had a boyfriend before but i always imagined it would be a conversation and not a surprise to both parties. getting to the point of calling someone my significant other always seemed like an exciting, special, and memorable moment but this does not feel like that. im just unsure what to do and am confused by what is happening. something is telling me i could be overreacting or overthinking but i also feel like that is a fake thought. i am interested in him and could eventually get to that point but this feels off. its actually kind of annoying me that he thinks he can just decide without telling me that we are a couple. does anyone have any similar experience? any advice on what to do next is greatly appreciated!!",1,1765963918.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
1poscnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1poscnh/christmas_day_with_6_dogs/,Christmas Day with 6 dogs,"Next week on my my favourite day of the year, I’ll be spending Christmas Day with my in laws. We’ll be going to my wife’s siblings house with all the in laws and partners family, and 6 dogs. I have nothing against my In laws and I will never separate from my wife because I love her, but the family’s love of dogs is infuriating. When having to go there it’s always “you’ll learn to like them just give them time” and it’s so overstimulating, and what’s exactly going to calm my phobia of dogs if a dog toy is placed on me so their German shepherd can climb up on me and lick my face. Then everyone to laugh at how cute it is.

The biggest reason for it is the worry my fear is going to be passed on to my 19 month old as my wife doesn’t want him to pick up on how I am around dogs since he loves animals. I’ve never liked dogs and been chased by Rottweilers, terriers all sorts and everyone always defends the dogs. So to know my Christmas is going to spent in an unfamiliar environment around 6 dogs so I’ll be overstimulated on all my senses all day is not fun. I’ve been told they’re all small but if there’s 2 springers and a chihuahua then it’s still not a comfort. Will probably update anyone interested next week if anyone’s interested but it’s just more of a rant about how I want to be far away from dogs rather than looking for a solution.

Edit: forgot to add for fun that I live in a small uk town where 83% of animals owned are dogs and for some reason everyone likes to walk them off lead and get angry because they expect them to be in every coffee shop barking at anyone. Even had someone comment when walked my son on his reins that “his dog was better behaved than mine”. ",5,1765963891.0,Dogfree,4,1.0,False

While I was recently in a trip in Lithuania, I really enjoyed every part of it, Kaunas and Vilnius were really beautiful and vibrant, load of activities to do, the food was surprisingly delicious 👌! However, if one thing got me the most was the grocery prices. Now coming from Italy I expected the prices to be relatively cheaper, but it was not! Now some items were cheap indeed (in Maxima, Rimi) but quite a lot of products were more expensive than Italy. 

Also went to some really nice coffee places both local and franchises and the price for latte/cappuccino was around 3€ cake was 3-5 €!  

Somethings were cheaper ofc in Lithuania like taxi, Uber ect.

How came it is this expensive?

1posc22,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Professional-Ad6641/comments/1posc22/why_origami/,Why origami?,"Hello! I really enjoy making things with my hands and origami is an art I fell I love with as a young teen. 

Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper into shapes giving them a life of their own. From a flat 2d plain, a carefully curated set of sequential folds transforms the paper into beautiful and awe-inspiring works of art.

As the daughter of a single mother, she made it a point to try and always keep me busy. I learned beading, painting, sewing, knitting, embroidery, and traditional paper crafts like paper dolls with tab clothing and photo scrapbooking. After so many projects, a very special one landed in my lap. I still remember it like it was yesterday. My 5th grade graduation gift? An origami box set, complete with paper and a book with both the basics and lots of models! Over the summer, and, for the next 8 years, I studied and honed the craft guided by my first book with animals and flowers, and then onto more difficult books full of mythical creatures and dinosaurs and more. So much to learn and yet to this day, about 20 years later, I still remember how to make several models by heart. I personally use origami as a meditative practice, calmly folding each step of the model as if I was making a warm, soothing cup, of pour over coffee. 

This ancient craft has grown to include several unique styles (3D interlocking models use hundreds of smaller models to make one big one) and techniques (including wet folding wherein after a model has been traditional folded a small amount of water is used to bend the paper into even more organic shapes) and I hope to explore these more in detail as the years go by. 

I'm sorry I don't have my full portfolio however over the next few weeks I'll be posting models and where they originated from! Pleased to make your acquaintance (⁠✿⁠^⁠‿⁠^⁠)

I made a post to the main PCOS subreddit a lil while ago but I'm really struggling to bend my brain into getting into a diet. Struggling to use my apartment's gym because of my messed up sleep habits + work life. I live with my parents and don't have too much room in my mini fridge + freezer to be keeping a ton of diet stuff (would LOVE to keep a bunch of frozen fruit for smoothies but alas. No room for it.) I know my weight is going to fluctuate with things like my cycle, the weather, my mental health (which is NOT good but I'm on meds for it... dunno if that'll help or make things worse. SSRIs are the evil I must endure)  
  
I can't force my folks to follow a diet as well so I'm honestly less inclined to buy diet or non-wheat, low/0 sugar products, non cow dairy, ect ect the whole 9 yards because it feels like cabinet clutter when there's only one person who will be eating the foods.

I have been actively cutting sodas out of my diet (big and I mean BIG fan of bloom prebiotic sodas. I dunno what the prebiotic is for but it tastes good. If you got more sodas like that dont  taste like cleaning a coffee pot lmk) and have been eating most carb heavy meals with protein to attempt to balance it out. Big fan of buldak ramen with a packet of chicken atm. I've been looking at compact at home walking pads to replace the need to go to the gym for a treadmill, but I'm trying to budget a little and find a quiet one so I can use it after work (10-11pm)

My PCOS makes me feel so ugly and makes me have no drive or desire to leave the house, let alone my room. I want to go out and try new things and go to the gym and try cute clothes but I feel like a walking bipedal pig. Even makeup makes me feel ugly. I tried to get tights for a sheep themed outfit I'm dying to make. Those were skinny people tights I was out of breath getting them on only for them to choke the hell out of my stomach and thighs. I don't want to live like this anymore.

Ig what I'm asking for is advice for smaller diet changes that don't feel like. Too much at once. At home exercises that aren't too demanding. Food substitutes for common stuff that my parents won't even be able to tell the difference from the other, non diet focused version (if they want my cooking that is)",1,1765963285.0,PCOSloseit,0,1.0,False

The materials require a large amount of assumed prior knowledge that is never touched on in the course, and any deficit in knowledge is impossible to catch up on prior because there is no public list of assumed knowledge to complete this course. I am not at all faulting the teachers or materials to be clear! This course just requires a lot of assumed knowledge that is never covered in the learning materials. 

If anyone wants to do this course DM me and I will send you the pdfs of the course overview + topics + lecture slides!!! Everything was downloadable via pdf and Im gonna fail this year so I need to spend next year going over everything so I can do it again next year. 



I was consistently an underachiever in high school, and chose to take essential math because I didn't think i needed an ATAR math for what I wanted to do at the time. It was easy to get all As in that without trying, but In my free time I also enjoyed doing math for fun. Namely doing spread sheets for various budgeting things- I later eventually used these skills to do costing sheets for my boss at a coffee roaster. I genuinely like math. But when I walked into the first tutorial room on day 1 after the lecture and opened the practice test I was lost instantly. The practice sheet was half full of things that where never mentioned in the lecture, and to my horror just about everything relied on knowing things that were never even mentioned in the lectures. I quit my job and meal prepped a month of food in advance for this course so I could focus on this and nothing else, but I don't think that it was ever possible for me to pass that course. Unless I had spent the last gap year trying to teach myself the whole maths methods curriculum from the qcaa guide lines- the only public info tangentially related. 





I hate having this defeatist attitude but I did all the work, went everyday, studied at home, had genuinely no distractions, but I have failed the first two tests and the last one is in two days. I do not think it is possible for me to pass that test. I am about to fail a course that I payed 1500$ and have no job, no certificate, no savings. I don't even know what I am going to do with my life anymore, I spent this last gap year preparing and saving up to be able to do this but now its just nothing. (live out of home independent, moving home not an option). I hope that this helps someone doing the course next year so they don't make the same mistake I did. ",4,1765963042.0,UQreddit,2,1.0,False

I have an entire wall in my kitchen that I plan to dedicate to my tanks. I need help, advice or just some ideas on how to do this :) Maybe some of you have some experience with this or some pointers? How did you do it at your home, did you buy ""aquarium stands"" for each of your tank? Did you buy something premade?   
  
Here are the issues:   
  
1) I hate the plastic built in covers and cover glass because many of my tanks have a paludarium zone with plants transitioning from aquatic to terrestrial. I also have cats that grew up desiring those aquatic plants for a snack. So maybe glass doors like in this at-home greenhouse? (pic from google to illustrate)

2) Similarly to the structure in [TN Aquascaping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v112mRbb_vc) tank room here:

I  want a lower surface to be a countertop to have a workspace for building things, maintenance work, etc.  Or honestly just to eat or drink coffee there while watching my tanks. 

3) The wall is a 50-80 cm thick dense cement wall in an apartment building. The neighbouring walls are (1) left, non-load bearing (20-30 cm of cement), the easiest to drill; (2) the external wall.

* Plan A is to come up with solutions here, and then make it myself or with the help of my more construction experienced friends. 
* Plan B is to buy some warehouse grade metal shelving, fix to walls, dress it up (but how?) 
* Plan C go to ikea and get the ""custom kitchen design"" project for this. I hate their shitty materials though. 

How do I make sure my structure is sound and not falls of the wall? I am mostly concerned with the ""bones"" of the setup.

P.S. my biggest achievement construction wise so far is making several tea display shelves and a bed which aint that much but might be enough

I used to be the typical “office worker” too:

one cup in the morning to wake up, one in the afternoon to survive, and one at night to finish a PPT.

Then my heart would race, my sleep got lighter and lighter, and the next day I felt even more tired—so I drank more again.



After I built CoffeeWatch, it was the first time I could truly *see* how much caffeine was still in my body.



**What it does:**



* Calculates your **current caffeine in your body** in real time + a **24-hour metabolism curve**
* Estimates **how much caffeine you’ll still have before sleep**, and warns you early: “Tonight may be harder to fall asleep”
* Lets you log drinks instantly on your watch: **raise your wrist + add 1 cup** (Americano / latte / milk tea / energy drinks, etc.)
* Shows it at a glance on **iPhone widgets / Lock Screen / Dynamic Island**: how much you’ve had today, and how much room you have left before your daily limit





I’m not here to tell you to quit coffee.

Looking at spreads like this lately, it genuinely feels like Nagpur cafés are stepping up their game. Better food, decent coffee, and places where you can actually sit and talk without rushing out.

We might not have the hype of Mumbai or Bengaluru yet, but the quality gap feels smaller than before.
What do you think? Is Nagpur catching up or do we still have a long way to go?

1pos0pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1pos0pl/swiping_right_on_someone_i_know/,Swiping right on someone I know?,"Ive lived beside my neighbor for 2 years now. I have a huge crush on him. When I moved in first we had a brief but nice chat outside and I invited him for coffee but he said another time as was going out somewhere. I know he has been described as shy and unassuming by people who know him and a very nice person.

I see him on the apps (hinge and tinder) and it's really weird I noticed before if I took a break from the apps he would also have disappeared if I came back and within a day or two of me coming back he would be back too. I have never swiped on him as wanted something to happen irl. Once after he paid someone to paint his fence I painted mine and then he changed his Hinge prompt to 'he was looking for someone who liked painting garden fences'. I felt it was specific it had to be aimed at me but within a day he changed the prompt again.

About a year ago I got the great idea to knock and ask him to help me move garden furniture. He was helpful and said ask anytime if I need anything but in my head I think I overthought the moment and instead of conversation flowing normally, I became shy with nerves. He did small talk and kept the conversation going but there were pauses. It only took like 5 minutes and then he went back to his own house but in my head I felt this was my 'big moment' and I failed and was deflated.

I have tried to time my schedule for an accidental bump into him at the same time but I always miss him sometimes by seconds. I added him on Instagram and it took him a month to follow me back. So I don't know what to do. My friends say he would have done something by now if he was interested. I keep excusing him in my head I know people have told me he is shy.

I am on the apps and trying to date other people but I cannot seem to get over this stupid crush and want to see if maybe he could be interested too.

Will I just bite the bullet and swipe on Hinge? He will be notified. I just dont know if it makes it awkward if I am just next door and he is not interested. But maybe he will never make a move and I will wait forever without knowing. 

I keep thinking that he is shy but maybe I am just deluding myself. 

Help. Will I swipe?

1porziv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/1porziv/would_you_rather_hold_crypto_forever_or_spend_it/,"Would you rather: hold crypto forever, or spend it daily like fiat?","I keep seeing two tribes in this space:

1. “HODL it like it’s digital gold.”
2. “If you can’t spend it, it’s just a collectible.”

Here’s my honest dilemma. Every time I’ve spent crypto, my brain screams: “Congrats, you just paid 0.000X BTC for a burger… that might be a holiday someday.” Then again, if we all treat crypto like a museum asset, how does it ever become money?

**A few things that changed how I look at it:**

* Volatility is the real villain. Spending a coin that can swing 10% in a week feels like paying with a stock. That’s why stablecoins keep showing up in payment talk; the IMF noted stablecoin trading volume hit $23T in 2024.
* Friction matters. The moment checkout feels harder than tapping Apple Pay, most people bail. Deloitte cites a survey where 85% of merchants see crypto payments as a way to reach new customers, and 77% point to lower fees.
* Taxes are the quiet killer. In many places, “spending” can be a taxable event. So you’re not just buying coffee—you’re doing accounting.

My current rule: I keep a “vault” bag I don’t touch, and a “spending” bag I refill with stables or profits. It helps mentally.

Which brings me to something I recently stumbled on: [**Digitap Presale**](https://presale.digitap.app/?utm_source=reddit%20marketing&utm_medium=organicmarketingaj&utm_campaign=17dec). It’s a crypto presale for a token called $TAP, but the angle isn’t “number go up.” The pitch is more practical: a Visa-style card layer, Apple/Google Pay, and one place to handle crypto + fiat.

I’m not affiliated—just sharing because it’s one of the few presale crypto coins I’ve seen that leads with payment rails, not memes. DYOR before you decide anything today.

So… would you rather:  
A) Hold forever (BTC/ETH as long-term savings), and use fiat/stables for life, or  
B) Spend daily and push adoption, even if it feels like “pizza day” risk?

1porxd6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1porxd6,Poker Night at the Inventory: Character Rundown,"Decided to give a rundown of each of the characters in my ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" reboot/sequel:

***Angel Dust***

A famous demon drag queen pornstar/hardcore gangster who died in the 1940s. Starring in many a raunchy film, soon realized that it was time for a change of scenery and became the first patron of the Hazbin Hotel, a place ran by the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, as a way to (hopefully) rehabilitate sinners and allow them to ascend up into heaven. Angel Dust is a carefree, crass, and lecherous spider-demon, with the twin occupations of violent gangster and drag queen porn star, who loves living off crime and vice in Hell. Except, his situation is not nearly as amazing as he pretends, and he might actually have more than just pragmatic reasons to stay at Charlie’s hotel.

Angel Dust’s strategy when playing poker basically flirt first, play second. He often uses his flirtatious acts as a way to throw off his opponents. Outside of that, he bluffs often and makes periodic bets throughout the river. Despite that, he’s very observant and a wiz at reading people.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Angel will choose to place one of his tommy guns. Should the player win the tommy gun, they will win the Angelic Drumgun for the Sniper in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Hazbin Hotel themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the titular Hazbin Hotel, with sinners roaming around the Inventory and Niffty rushing around trying to kill every bug she sees. Angel Dust will also gain a new outfit based on his get up in the episode ""Masquerade"". Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding the staff of the Hazbin Hotel, hell itself, and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Niffty seeing a bug on the losing opponent, and being sicked onto them.

* “Careful, sweetheart, if you bet any higher you might grow a spine.” - Reaction to player raising
* “You call *that* a raise? I’ve seen johns more threatening.” - Raising
* “Oh, honey, that bluff is see-througher than my work outfits.” - Calling a bluff
* “Heh heh, pal, I know a bluff when I see one. Call.” - Calling a bluff
* “Holy shit!” - Reaction to large bet/all in

***Zoe***

The resident eldritch horror turned fandom enthusiast of Spooky Academy. Once an eldritch horror that lived inside a totem named Z’gord, it was released and ended up being shown the wonders of high school, making it decide to live as a high school girl named Zoe. Zoe is a HUGE enjoyer of fandom culture, including fanart, fanfiction, and shipping culture (her favorite ship being Naruto X Garfield).

Zoe is a wildcard when it comes to poker. She often bets and calls randomly with abandon.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Zoe will choose to place her fanfic “Liam Prom”. Should the player win Liam Prom, they will win a wig based on Zoe’s hair in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Monster Prom themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes Spooky Academy, with the school’s student body roaming the Inventory. Zoe will also gain a new outfit that is a cosplay of Garfield. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Zoe’s adventures at Spooky Academy/Monster Con and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Polly Geist and Scott Howl (the PRANK MASTERZ) pulling a dangerous prank on the losing opponent.

***The Spy***

The shapeshifting, disappearing frenchman assassin. Cigarette in one hand, butterfly knife in the other, The Spy is an international man of mystery who deals in infiltration, deception, and psychological warfare. Whether he’s impersonating an enemy, hiding in plain sight, or backstabbing a heavy, The Spy operates with cool composure, impeccable style, and minimal effort.

When it comes to poker, the Spy is the hardest to read out of each character. He keeps his composer and usually checks and calls and doesn’t bet or raise until the end of the river. He also knows when to fold as well as when somebody’s bluffing

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Spy will choose to place the Dead Ringer. Should the player win the Dead Ringer, they will win a special casino themed outfit for the Spy in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Team Fortress 2 themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes 2Fort, with the tournament being held in BLU team’s intelligence room.

* “Do not act so cocky, you’ve only got lucky” - Lost a hand

***Sonar***

The Superhero Dispatch Network’s resident batboy/crypto bro. Once a Harvard graduate turned supervillain, Sonar orchestrated some of the biggest Silicon Valley investment frauds in US history. After being arrested, he decided to turn his life around by joining the SDN’s (Superhero Dispatch Network) phoenix program that’s dedicated to reforming.

Despite his attitude, Sonar is very calculative when it comes to poker. He tries his best to plan for every possibility, but has a tendency to be blind sided when the pot gets big enough.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Sonar will choose to place an SDN coffee mug. Should the player win the mug, they will win an SDN shirt and tie for the Scout in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Dispatch themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the SDN building, with members of Z-Team roaming the Inventory.

* “(Transforms into his Mega Bat form) *\*SCREEACH\** FUCK! FUCK! GOD DAMN IT! (Transforms back) …Okay, let’s just pretend that never happened.” - Lost a large pot

***Mira***

A member of the famous kpop idol group HUNTR/X. Mira acts as a famous celebrity by day, and works as a demon hunter by night, protecting Korea from vicious demons who seek to devour their souls. Mira was considered the black sheep of her family, but she eventually joined HUNTR/X in their mission to protect humanity from demons as the group’s visual expert and lead dancer.

Mira’s strategy when playing poker is basically to be as aggressive as possible. She makes bets throughout the river and is the first to call when she thinks someone is bluffing. She may even intimidate her opponents into folding with her aggression.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Mira will choose some Saja Boys merch she found in a trash can. Winning the bounty unlocks Mira’s weapon for the Demoman in Team Fortress 2.

***John Captain***

The icon of Newgrounds. The foulmouthed leader of the Tankmen, John Captain has been in everything under the sun, from Newgrounds Rumble to Friday Night Funkin.

Captain’s strategy when playing poker is bold, yet strategic. He bluffs a lot during the river, but also makes strategic moves when the time calls for it. 

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Captain will choose his team’s most prized possession: Disc 1 of Titanic. Winning the bounty unlocks a Tankmen helmet for all the classes in Team Fortress 2.

She takes care of housekeeping and cooking for the other students. She serves as the game’s dealer.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Kirumi will choose a plush toy of Monokuma. Winning the bounty unlocks a Monokuma mask for the Spy and Soldier in Team Fortress 2.

During the date, she herself suggested that we should go watch a movie sometime, Dhurandhar.

Two days after the date, she messaged me saying that she and her roommate were going to watch the movie and asked me to join them. I was clear that I wanted to meet her one-on-one and not with her roommate, so I told her that I had a lot of work that day and couldn’t come. I suggested that we could meet for coffee sometime, just the two of us.

After that, she started ignoring me a bit. Two days later, I messaged her asking if we could meet for coffee the next day. She said okay and told me she would confirm in the morning. Then I remembered that I had a coding contest from 2 PM to 5 PM, so I told her that I wouldn’t be able to come because of that. She said okay.

After that, I suggested meeting the next day. She replied that she would only be able to confirm the next morning. Now it’s 2:30 PM and she still hasn’t messaged, and it seems like she probably won’t.",0,1765962068.0,TwentiesIndia,10,0.29,False

The Liiga’s Week 15 clash between JYP and KooKoo on December 17, 2025, promises to be a tighter contest than a reindeer in a sauna. Let’s parse the odds, digest the (limited) news, and serve up a prediction with a side of Nordic humor.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Slight Edge for JYP, But Don’t Bet Your Socks

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind JYP, albeit with the subtlety of a snowball in a blizzard. At Bovada, JYP’s moneyline odds of **+111** (implied probability: \~47.5%) vs. KooKoo’s **+106** (\~48.7%) suggest a near-50/50 toss-up. DraftKings and BetRivers tweak the numbers slightly, but the takeaway is clear: this is a *“I’ll-let-you-pick-the-champion”* scenario.

The spread markets add intrigue. JYP is favored by **-1.5 goals** at inflated odds (Bovada: +320, DraftKings: +310), while KooKoo is a **+1.5** underdog at shorter prices (Bovada: -133). If you’re betting on a goal differential, the books are whispering, *“JYP might win, but not by much—unless they suddenly invent a 16th man to score.”*

Total goals? The **Under 6.5** is the consensus darling (Bovada: -134, DraftKings: -107), implying a gritty, defensive battle. Over 6.5 sits at +110 to +120, which is hockey-speak for “sprinkle some coffee on your bet and hope for a breakaway.”

### 2. Digest the News: A Void So Deep, Even Zamboni Can’t Fill It

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a Finnish face-off between Helsingfors IFK (HIFK) and HPK Kuopio, where the ice is cold, the coffee is colder, and the coaching staff is colder still. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni on a caffeine buzz.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Mayhem

The numbers don’t lie (well, unless they’re on a bookmaker’s spreadsheet). HIFK is the favorite at **-150** implied odds (decimal 1.65), translating to a **60.6% chance** to win. HPK, the underdog, sits at **+220** (decimal 2.2), implying a **31.25% chance**. The spread? HIFK must win by **1.5 goals** (-1.5), while HPK can cover by losing by 1 or fewer. The totals market is split: Over/Under lines range from **5.0 to 5.5 goals**, with the Under priced lower (1.65–1.76), suggesting bookmakers expect a tighter game than the handball matches we all forgot about.

---

### Digesting the News: Coach Karlsson’s Tantrum and the Ghost of Handball Past

HIFK’s recent **37-27 handball victory** over Ekenäs IF was, in the words of head coach Robin Karlsson, “the worst match of the year.” Yes, you read that right—*he won by 10 goals* and still called it “the worst.” It’s like baking a cake and then crying because the icing was lopsided. Karlsson claimed he was only satisfied with **two goals scored** (out of 37). We assume he’s referring to the two seconds of the game he wasn’t checking his phone.

Meanwhile, HPK’s news is as quiet as a snowdrift in Lapland. No injuries, no drama, and no mention of their last game. In sports, silence is golden—or suspicious. Are they plotting a comeback? Stockpiling sausages? Only time will tell.

I tried having a talk with my wife about the issues surrounding intimacy, connection, etc. and she completely avoided the whole conversation. She walked away while I was trying to talk to her and express myself and my side of what I believe is going on. She went and got her coffee ☕️ and walked to the bedroom and shut the door. Needless to say I felt pretty disrespected and since it was 10pm our child was asleep I didn’t try to continue the conversation. I’m speaking into a void at this point.  So I texted her. I kept it short thinking by chance she’s probably doesn’t want to risk waking our child up. Ok no problem but she just left me on read. No follow up the next day no nothing. A month has went by and still no acknowledgment of my grievances about our sex life, our home life, nothing. Nada. 👎 my birthday was earlier this month and she got me a cake 🎂 and presents 🎁 we spent time with our kid, went to dinner with my family and had a really good time. We had conversations about dinner, the things her and my family talked about, Christmas 🎄 etc…but still nothing about our issues. So I got to thinking about why she’s avoiding the conversation about us, and so I was researching what makes a spouse avoid conversations about the marriage and after going down the rabbit hole of Avoidant Attachment Style relationships she fits the bill on it. I’m the anxious attachment style type. I obviously can’t diagnose my wife or myself but I feel like this is a good starting point. Many of the conversations we have that are “safe” are very trivial superficial things. Anytime we delve into deeper emotional topics she avoids. Which we don’t really have those conversations honestly. I didn’t really think about that until now. I feel like my eyes 👀 are peeled all the way fuckin back now. It makes me feel so bad in a sense that we are not “connected” like I wish we were. And maybe we never have been. Maybe I was an avoidant at one point maybe not. But this makes me want to seek therapy because I feel like maybe she doesn’t know she’s like this. From what I’ve read it’s really hard to get avoidants into therapy. She maybe just perfectly fine with surface level conversation, us working, raising our child etc. She’s expressed that she loves being married in the past and I just wonder if maybe this is what she believes life is all about. Then withdraws when emotional work needs to be done. If any of this makes sense it’s like she’s happy and content in our little box 📦 and anything that questions that world is considered “unsafe” to her.

1portif,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1portif,Poker Night at the Inventory: Character Rundown,"(ARTWORK MADE BY ME)

Decided to give a rundown of each of the characters in my ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" reboot/sequel:

***Angel Dust***

A famous demon drag queen pornstar/hardcore gangster who died in the 1940s. Starring in many a raunchy film, soon realized that it was time for a change of scenery and became the first patron of the Hazbin Hotel, a place ran by the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, as a way to (hopefully) rehabilitate sinners and allow them to ascend up into heaven. Angel Dust is a carefree, crass, and lecherous spider-demon, with the twin occupations of violent gangster and drag queen porn star, who loves living off crime and vice in Hell. Except, his situation is not nearly as amazing as he pretends, and he might actually have more than just pragmatic reasons to stay at Charlie’s hotel.

Angel Dust’s strategy when playing poker basically flirt first, play second. He often uses his flirtatious acts as a way to throw off his opponents. Outside of that, he bluffs often and makes periodic bets throughout the river. Despite that, he’s very observant and a wiz at reading people.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Angel will choose to place one of his tommy guns. Should the player win the tommy gun, they will win the Angelic Drumgun for the Sniper in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Hazbin Hotel themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the titular Hazbin Hotel, with sinners roaming around the Inventory and Niffty rushing around trying to kill every bug she sees. Angel Dust will also gain a new outfit based on his get up in the episode ""Masquerade"". Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding the staff of the Hazbin Hotel, hell itself, and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Niffty seeing a bug on the losing opponent, and being sicked onto them.

* “Heh heh, pal, I know a bluff when I see one. Call.” - Calling a bluff
* “Holy shit!” - Reaction to large bet/all in

***Zoe***

The resident eldritch horror turned fandom enthusiast of Spooky Academy. Once an eldritch horror that lived inside a totem named Z’gord, it was released and ended up being shown the wonders of high school, making it decide to live as a high school girl named Zoe. Zoe is a HUGE enjoyer of fandom culture, including fanart, fanfiction, and shipping culture (her favorite ship being Naruto X Garfield).

Zoe is a wildcard when it comes to poker. She often bets and calls randomly with abandon.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Zoe will choose to place her fanfic “Liam Prom”. Should the player win Liam Prom, they will win a wig based on Zoe’s hair in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Monster Prom themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes Spooky Academy, with the school’s student body roaming the Inventory.

***The Spy***

The shapeshifting, disappearing frenchman assassin. Cigarette in one hand, butterfly knife in the other, The Spy is an international man of mystery who deals in infiltration, deception, and psychological warfare. Whether he’s impersonating an enemy, hiding in plain sight, or backstabbing a heavy, The Spy operates with cool composure, impeccable style, and minimal effort.

When it comes to poker, the Spy is the hardest to read out of each character. He keeps his composer and usually checks and calls and doesn’t bet or raise until the end of the river. He also knows when to fold as well as when somebody’s bluffing

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Spy will choose to place the Dead Ringer. Should the player win the Dead Ringer, they will win a special casino themed outfit for the Spy in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Team Fortress 2 themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes 2Fort, with the tournament being held in BLU team’s intelligence room.

* “Do not act so cocky, you’ve only got lucky” - Lost a hand

***Sonar***

The Superhero Dispatch Network’s resident batboy/crypto bro. Once a Harvard graduate turned supervillain, Sonar orchestrated some of the biggest Silicon Valley investment frauds in US history. After being arrested, he decided to turn his life around by joining the SDN’s (Superhero Dispatch Network) phoenix program that’s dedicated to reforming.

Despite his attitude, Sonar is very calculative when it comes to poker. He tries his best to plan for every possibility, but has a tendency to be blind sided when the pot gets big enough.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Sonar will choose to place an SDN coffee mug. Should the player win the mug, they will win an SDN shirt and tie for the Scout in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Dispatch themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the SDN building, with members of Z-Team roaming the Inventory.

***Mira***

A member of the famous kpop idol group HUNTR/X. Mira acts as a famous celebrity by day, and works as a demon hunter by night, protecting Korea from vicious demons who seek to devour their souls. Mira was considered the black sheep of her family, but she eventually joined HUNTR/X in their mission to protect humanity from demons as the group’s visual expert and lead dancer.

Mira’s strategy when playing poker is basically to be as aggressive as possible. She makes bets throughout the river and is the first to call when she thinks someone is bluffing. She may even intimidate her opponents into folding with her aggression.

set in an alternate universe where women can be hired as secretaries who also provide sex services. 

what I can remember:
- FMC has to give the boss (MMC) a blowjob as part of the interview
- FMC is tied up and hung from the wall, gagged with a red ball gag while MMC uses a vibrator on her, he gives her a small handkerchief and tells her that he'll stop when she lets go. she refuses to drop it, chapter ends with handkerchief falling to the floor as she becomes unconscious (from orgasms)
- one scene where they have sex and then FMC wakes up in a bedroom, finds door locked, later learns that the door leads to an office where MMC was having a meeting
- daily tasks: FMC has to get coffee for MMC, pick up his dry cleaning (this may not be accurate but its what I seem to remember)
- MMC makes FMC use an anal plug for full days (3 sizes, they slowly use bigger ones)

additional info: think there was a scene where there was a party but im not very sure. if im not wrong the title had 'office' in it, full title 2-3 words. dont know if the book is finished. 
- no fandom, original story and characters
- fully consensual

I went to cafe that serves coffee, as well as food and some alcohol. A family sat down next to me and I didn’t think anything of it until I smelled something bad. I looked up and to my shock they were changing their baby’s diaper in the middle of the crowded cafe on a (expensive looking) felt couch. I just got up and left but I told the staff what was happening (sorry I’m a snitch but wouldn’t you want to know if that happened in your locally owned cafe??) but they didn’t react a whole lot. I’m not sure what they did after I left. For reference, the cafe didn’t have a baby changing station anywhere (at least as far as I’m aware) and there were many other children that were there while I was working before they arrived. So I’m wondering if it’s just a French thing? Is that normal in France?? I can’t imagine it’s very hygienic since food is being served literal feet away from where they were changing the baby’s diaper. ",1,1765961471.0,AskFrance,130,0.51,False

***Angel Dust***

A famous demon drag queen pornstar/hardcore gangster who died in the 1940s. Starring in many a raunchy film, soon realized that it was time for a change of scenery and became the first patron of the Hazbin Hotel, a place ran by the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, as a way to (hopefully) rehabilitate sinners and allow them to ascend up into heaven. Angel Dust is a carefree, crass, and lecherous spider-demon, with the twin occupations of violent gangster and drag queen porn star, who loves living off crime and vice in Hell. Except, his situation is not nearly as amazing as he pretends, and he might actually have more than just pragmatic reasons to stay at Charlie’s hotel.

Angel Dust’s strategy when playing poker basically flirt first, play second. He often uses his flirtatious acts as a way to throw off his opponents. Outside of that, he bluffs often and makes periodic bets throughout the river. Despite that, he’s very observant and a wiz at reading people.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Angel will choose to place one of his tommy guns. Should the player win the tommy gun, they will win the Angelic Drumgun for the Sniper in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Hazbin Hotel themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the titular Hazbin Hotel, with sinners roaming around the Inventory and Niffty rushing around trying to kill every bug she sees.

When I laid my eyes on her I thought to myself “okay she’s cute I kinda wanna talk to her” so I did. Fast forward two weeks later she comes in class pretty sad and it looked like she was crying I sat beside and asked her what’s wrong and told her that we’d go and have a cup of coffee and discuss why she’s this sad and we did. This was the first time us meeting outside of class. She told me the reason she was sad is because a guy (turns out to be her ex or currently dating still) caught her walking around in uni wearing a “slutty” outfit I guess? So obviously I comforted her and I admitted to her that I was into her and wanted to talk to her on a deeper level she replied saying “yea I feel better and good and happy whenever I’m around you” I got her number and we started chatting normally then about 2 weeks later she suddenly starts replying less and less. I was confused so I confronted her about it she gave me the “ I’m dealing with a lot of problems at my home and a lot of work issues” I was like okay it’s fine take your time to reply but let me know beforehand if you’re dealing with stuff like that. News flash she still was taking too long to reply,because I like this girl a lot I confronted her once again about the same topic and she told me that she’s not ready to take anything serious and she “just got out of a relationship” and I insisted to know if she was letting me off easily or she genuinely can’t and obviously she said she actually can’t. Fast forward around a month I peek through the class window and I see that girl walking down the campus with a dude and seemed like they were just talking but then that guy reaches in for a hug but that girl then lowers his hands basically not letting him do that. At that point I was mad as fuck because I’m pretty sure this guy was the same one that argued with her about her style. Anyways the next day I decided to confront her about what I saw so I told her let’s meet after class I wanna talk to you about something important she said “okay I’ll text you when I’m able to”. Guess what she’s still yet to send me a message (that was about 2 days ago) so idk man",1,1765961107.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

We’re planning a laid-back road trip from Pune to Goa and have 2 spots open if anyone wants to join.

Quick details:

* 🗓 21st Jan morning to 25th Jan evening/night
* 🚗 Road trip in our own car
* 🏨 Staying in North Goa, mostly exploring around there + one day in South Goa
* 💸 Rough cost: ₹15–16k per person (all-inclusive)

About us:

* 3 of us (all 28 yrs)
* Been to Goa last year, so we know the basics
* Plan is to take it easy, explore, eat well, and chill

Before locking things in, we’d like to meet once in Pune (coffee / short hangout) just to get a vibe check and make sure everyone’s comfortable.

Open to any gender. Looking for easygoing, respectful people who enjoy road trips and flexible plans.

If this sounds like your kind of trip, comment or DM and we’ll connect 🙂",2,1765960374.0,goatravel,2,0.75,False

I’m a 31 year old man from Chile. I’m a coffee geek (also a barista) and I studied musical production for a while. Recently found out it’s likely I’m neurodivergent. I’m very drawn to art in all its forms, from music to graffiti. 
For some reason throughout my late teens and adulthood, I stopped having friends. I only have had people online around since (and some long distance flings), whose interests were aligned with mine but also bonded deeply through trauma. In fact, almost all of them have been women. Unpack that as you will…
And now I find myself completely alone. Depression has taken away pretty much everything. I used to feel like I could contribute or be helpful, I truly enjoy listening to people and sharing. But sometimes you lend a hand and they take the whole arm.
For the first time in ages, I’m contemplating ending things. I don’t wanna come across as someone who’d threaten/hint self harm only to get attention. It’s never been my intention to invoke pity. I don’t need pity and I don’t need a sympathy chat. I need someone who is genuinely interested in becoming friends. If it pans out, great. If not, at least I tried. 
I’m open to talking to anyone. ",1,1765960340.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False
