I cracked open Author Jane’s 182-chapter roller-coaster on a whim—and suddenly it was 3 a.m., my coffee was cold, and I was bargaining with myself for “just one more chapter.” If you’re into high-stakes power plays, messy betrayals, and chemistry that scorches the page, this one’s for you:

* **Meet Reina Peters—rock bottom never looked this fierce.** In one brutal day she loses her job, her inheritance, AND catches her “cancer-stricken” boyfriend going full doggy style with her scheming stepmother. (Yes, you read that right. My jaw is *still* on the floor.)
* **Enter Denver Coltello, the mafia king whose name makes grown men stutter.** Rumor has it he “dines with the devil,” but he only has eyes for the broken woman downing her ninth whiskey at his hotel bar. His first words to her? Not a pickup line—an order. Cue the shivers.
* **Tropes firing on all cylinders:**
   * Devil-billionaire × fallen heiress (with teeth)
   * Love-at-first-glare that turns into possessive obsession
   * Office enemies, mafia politics, surprise pregnancy (!!)
   * A revenge arc so satisfying you’ll want to fist-pump every few chapters.
* **Side-character spice:** a slutty ex-boyfriend desperate for a second chance (lol no), a stepmother who’d sell her own pancreas for clout, and Denver’s consigliere who ships the main couple harder than we do.
* **Pacing = relentless.** Every chapter ends on a “how-is-this-legal” cliff-hanger—boardroom ambushes, bedroom power plays, and gunmetal roses delivered with ominous notes like “Mine.” You’ve been warned.

If you loved the feral devotion in *Twisted Love* or the mafia heat of *Ruthless People*, add this to your queue tonight. First chapters are free on WildNovel—grab them, then come scream with me when Reina returns to the company in head-to-toe black and makes the board grovel. 🔥💼🔫

how about:
“Hey let’s grab a urine sample and talk about your last HIV test 🧪✨”

Hey friends! Ever feel like you’re swimming against the tide in the vast ocean of AI? 🤔 Just me? Okay, fair enough! But seriously, with how fast technology is evolving, it’s easy to feel left behind. But don’t worry—I've got your back! 🙌 

Let’s chat about three killer platforms that can help you level up your AI skills and start making that sweet, sweet cash. 💸 

**1. Coursera**  
Imagine sipping your morning coffee while learning from world-class instructors without leaving your living room. That's Coursera for you! Here’s why it’s a must:  
- **Diverse courses**: From beginner to advanced, you can find everything! Wanna dip your toes into data science? They’ve got that. Interested in machine learning? They definitely have you covered!  
- **Real-world projects**: Many courses include hands-on projects. So, you’re not just learning theory; you’re getting practical skills that can increase your marketable value.  
- **Certificates**: Did someone say resume booster? 📝 Those shiny certificates can definitely catch an employer's eye. 

**2. Udacity**  
If you’re aiming to dive deep, Udacity is your treasure map! Here’s what makes it special:  
- **Nanodegrees**: These are specialized, industry-relevant courses tailored to give you exactly what employers want. Data analysis? Check. AI programming? Oh, you bet!  
- **Mentorship**: It feels like having a personal coach while navigating through the ocean of knowledge. They provide feedback and keep you on track. Who wouldn’t want a cheerleader while grinding? 🎉  
- **Network Opportunities**: You’ll get access to a community of learners and professionals. We all know it’s not just about what you know, but who you know.

**3. Skillshare**  
Feeling overwhelmed by rigid structures? Skillshare is like a chill hub for all kinds of creative and technical skills. Here’s the scoop:  
- **Mix and Match**: Learn AI alongside things like graphic design or writing. Because let’s be real; knowing how to create stunning visuals for your AI projects is a game-changer.  
- **Short and Sweet**: Most courses are bite-sized! Perfect for those of us who struggle to stay focused for longer than a TikTok video. 👀  
- **Community Projects**: You can collaborate and get critiques from other creatives, making learning even more fun!

Now, I know you might be thinking, “This sounds great, but can I really afford it?” Totally fair! If you’re looking for a way to learn and earn at the same time, check out this cool program I found: [Imagine Education - AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It’s an awesome resource that could really set you up for success. 😉

No more excuses, folks! It’s time to roll up those sleeves, dive in, and explore the exciting world of AI. The journey's gonna be wild, but trust me—all those late nights and learning will pay off. Who knows, you might just become the next innovator we’re all talking about!

Future Mate,

I’m a guy in my late 20s looking to build a solid, long-term friendship with someone who’s also keen on something deeper than just surface-level chat or the occasional pub catch-up.

Not after a quick mate for drinks and footy once every few months, although they would be nice. I’m talking real connections. Someone to hang out with regularly online or offline, talk life, unwind, get into some good banter, and actually show up as a mate.

I’ve got a good life and all the usual responsibilities, but something’s missing... a mate who’s down for road trips, late-night chats, dogs at the park, maybe even some “life unpacking” over coffee or a fire pit.

What I’m not after: fake energy, flakey chats, judgement or drugs.

What I am after: consistency, laughs, honesty, emotions, vulnerability, and depth.

Comment below and I will reach out, or feel free to message me directly.

I'd love to share some selfies, talk about deal breakers first up to avoid wasting each other's time and fast tracking if we have the potential to connect even.

I guess it’s time for me to come clean. Not because I feel too bad for what I’ve been doing, but because it’s possible my eldest son is on to me.

I have 3 kids and a wonderful wife. For more than 25 years our family has loved doing puzzles together. Since we started, I’ve done something that may seem unsavory to people that don’t understand the joy of putting in that final piece. To ensure it was always me, whenever we start a new puzzle I take one of the pieces and hide it in a green sock that’s at the bottom of my dresser. Whenever we get to the very end, we all, once again, lost a piece. We all search frantically until I’m the hero who finds it.

Well, this past Sunday we got to completion once again, only this time there are TWO pieces missing. We begin searching. It may be my imagination but my eldest son gave me a look. It was a half smirk. I think he’s on to me.

Derek, if you’re reading this, I have more patience than you do. I’ll hold my piece forever if I need to. “Find” yours first, and let’s end this madness…

A fellow Reddit user PMd me an incredible idea. I’m going to try and contact the manufacturer and order his missing piece. I’m going to “find” it when it arrives, then “find” mine immediately after. I almost feel bad when I consider how truly confused he will be. Thank you Spockhighonspores!

I don’t think he’s found this thread yet because he hasn’t approached me about it, so this could still work. I’m so excited! This will go down in family history.

EDIT-2::

Well folks, I’ve been duped. I got up this morning, went into the kitchen to get some coffee and as I walked past the puzzle I noticed that it had been completed. All pieces accounted for. I calmly, and politely knocked on Derek’s door and asked him about it. He denied knowing anything about it. Like, super convincing. I went down back down to my bedroom, confused as ever and just sat in bed with a blank stare. My wife asked me what’s wrong, and I told her that the puzzle was completed and I have no idea how it got done.

She literally started laughing like a damn hyena… “IVE ALWAYS KNOWN ABOUT YOUR DUMB GREEN SOCK” I’m in shock. I’m numb. Like a damn gut punch. So as it turns out, she’s known what I’ve been doing for at least 10 years. She said she loved watching me walk around thinking I was some criminal mastermind tricking everyone, and that’s why she never said anything. She wanted me to have my win, while she secretly laughed and had her own fun in secret.

I don’t even know what to say. I’m just processing everything. I cannot believe she’s had this over me for so long and I literally had no idea. She noticed a decade ago that I had just 1 green sock, since I lost its pair forever ago, and immediately knew something was up with it since I refused to throw it away. I guess that makes sense. I’m an idiot.

I’ve come to the realization that she’s actually the master here, it’s her house, and I should be thankful she lets me live in it.

At least she promised not to tell the kids.

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

**Thanks to u/Arifault for helping with the comments**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/GJGK1hVrWS)  **Dec 2, 2021**

I (22F) and my girls go on a girls trip every December since we all have breaks from Uni. We’re a group of 6 girls and have been doing this since we were 18. We weren’t able to go last year cause of covid. 


My best friend (21F) has 14 month old son. Since her son was born, we haven’t had a day alone with her, which I guess is understandable because she is a new mum.

We tried to include her in all the plans we had since having her child but noticed she would always ask if we could change what the plan was to accommodate her baby coming too. This meant the plan was almost always a coffee shop. I genuinely didn’t mind changing all of the plans to be more child friendly, and just assumed she couldn’t get her man or parents to watch her baby for a while. 



I called her a few weeks ago to ask if she wanted to come to a club with us and she asked if we could go to a coffee shop instead so she could bring her baby. I asked if there was no one who could watch her baby (she lives with her husband who works from home, and her in laws), to which she replied that she’ll feel insane mum guilt if she goes to a club and leaves her baby at home. I said I understood but that I really needed a night out, but we could do coffee the next day. She texted me the following day asking why I had such a big problem having her child around. I was baffled because I’m the one constantly changing plans to accommodate her son, but I asked her to understand me for one night. I really needed a night out and didn’t want to be in a coffee shop. She sounded agitated by my reasoning but left it at that.

Now… the girls trip is coming in a week. I didn’t really tell her about the trip because I knew she couldn’t come alone but she heard it from another friend. She jokingly asked why I didn’t invite her to which I laughed off because I felt so awkward. I told her she was welcome to come as always and I would love to have her there. I thought the call was an indication that she would come alone. She called the next day to ask if the resort we were going to be staying at was child friendly. I said it wasn’t as we were looking for more of a club atmosphere and that’s what it was. She then said she couldn’t make it then if it wasn’t going to properly accommodate her son in the activities we do. I said I understand and that I’m sorry. 



I got a call from her older sister last night calling me all sorts of names because I didn’t want my best friends son to come on the girls trip and that I’m being childish. I’m genuinely still in such shock and don’t know how to even type what I’m feeling right now.

We haven’t had proper fun together in ages because it’s either we’re too busy caring for my best friends baby, or a few of us were missing because of covid etc. This is the first time we’ve all been together since we graduated undergrad and started our masters. We’ve been having hectic years and just wanted one carefree holiday. 

So, Am I the asshole for wanting our annual girls trip to actually be a girls trip?

Edit - I tried to hint once that I wanted my birthday a few months ago to be just us but she laughed it off and made a joke about how her and her son are attached by the hip and she couldn’t leave him. She asked if we could minimise how much alcohol there was going to be so she could bring her son.

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**OneMikeNation**

>Info: what does the other 4 women think about not telling her of the plans?

**OOP**

>>We all wanted to just be up front with her about wanting her to come alone but she’s a very sensitive person and definitely wouldn’t take it well. That’s why we decided to keep it on the down low and just bring it up randomly this week

**~**

**nobracketsociety**

>I'm going to go with NTA, but be prepared to potentially lose that friendship. You're allowed to invite whoever you want to the girl's night, but maybe have a separate, more low-key get together with the best friend if you still want to stay friends. I don't think it's fair for her to bring the baby every single time, but I also don't think it's fair to only do adult-exclusive activities.

**OOP**

>>Yeah for sure, but I think that’s what the problem is. 99% of the time we meet up, we go to the park or a cafe so she can bring her son. We rarely ever do anything without her and her son. Which is why we are desperate for this girls trip. We love her and her son but it’s been a long time without us having actual fun to be honest.

**OOP with additional info on her friends husband. Is she in an abusive/controlling marriage**

>Just to clear some things up, we actually know and are friends with her husband. He has contacted us several times asking us to take her out to a spa or something which he’ll pay for because she doesn’t get time away from the baby, but she picks a fight with him and says she doesn’t want to be away from the baby. She doesn’t even allow him to take the baby out by himself. 

>He is older than her and she is a housewife but it was by choice. She keeps saying how lucky she is that she’s married to a man who will provide for her and let her be a full time mum. A lot of people seem to have the same theory as you but I genuinely don’t see it as her being influenced by anyone. She’s been judgemental of mothers taking time away from their kids, even to go back to work, since we were kids. She has a one dimensional view of what motherhood is and I don’t think anyone can change that. 

>Also, not sure if this is important but her in laws always offer to baby sit and tell my friend to go on a date with her husband or go do things she likes but she declines. There’s no one she feels is good enough to take care of her child. Even her own mother hasn’t ever been alone with her grandchild.

**&**

>I don’t think it’s about anyone getting into her head actually. Her husband and in laws encourage her to take time away from the baby. But she thinks motherhood means being with your child 24/7. I mentioned this in the previous post’s comments but she criticises our other friends and just any mother who goes anywhere without their baby. She’s even against taking her child to kindergarten and the early years of school because she thinks she won’t be ready to let them go.

**tripletmom961**

>>OP your friend is being ridiculous. When my TRIPLETS were little my husband encouraged me to get away for a girls' weekend trip and he stayed home with them when they were around 13 months old. They are grown now and have turned into wonderful adults (daughter will be heading to Med school soon; one son is a firefighter and the other son manages a restaurant). We have a great relationship. added bonus: they are very close to their dad because of all of the time he spent with them growing up

**OOP**

>>Aww that’s so wholesome 🥺 you and your husband sound like amazing parents and partners. I wish my friend let her husband take up any sort of responsibility with their son but she doesn’t. She sees her son as hers and not theirs. Not sure how he feels about it.

**OOP on never cutting her off after 3 occassions and her friends thoughts on clubbing**

>It’s been a lot more than 3 occasions. Also, she doesn’t like it when us 5 go out together without her. I can understand how that must make her feel but for her to ask us to not go clubbing and just go with her to a coffee shop instead every time, rubs me the wrong way. I posted a picture of me on a date at a pub on Instagram and she messaged me saying “have you become an alcoholic for a tinder date?”.. what does that even mean?

**OOP when told the only thing she messed up was excluding her friend and planning behind her back**

>I agree. I felt terrible planning the trip without her but honestly, every time we plan something and try to tell her that we want it to be just us, she’ll definitely still come for the plan but will still come with her son. I just thought including her in the planning would definitely make her come but there was a 0% chance she would come alone. And I also wouldn’t be able to tell her to just not come if she couldn’t come alone. Sounds bad, I know. But she also isn’t the type to hear us out. We’ll have to speak to her at one point or another though so I think I’ll definitely have a good talk with her and let everything out this week. Let’s hope we can see eye to eye. Thanks for the advice :)

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/wSt8CJiVRO)  **Jan 8, 2022 (1 month later)**

So.. for anyone who read my previous post and shared their advice, thank you and here’s an update.

So we went on our girls trip and had the best week we had since before covid started. We all kind of chose to not speak about the issue with our friend and just have a good time, and sort out the issue when we got back home. The day after we got back, I texted my best friend and asked if we could come over and see her and her son and also to deliver the gifts we had gotten them during the trip. She read the message and hadn’t replied for 3 days. I called her husband just to ask if she was ok and he said she was and he doesn’t know why she wasn’t responding to me. Anyway I decided not to double text as I didn’t want to nag her.

She texted back after 3 days with an essay like response explaining how disappointed she felt that I thought she would give up days of motherhood just to drink and “be a skank”.. good to know what she thinks of us then lol.

She ended the message by saying she and her husband are trying for another baby and she doesn’t have the mental capacity to deal with our “crap”. After which, she left all the group chats and blocked us all on every social media platform. 

So… Thats that I guess. Best friends since year 4 and this is how our friendship has ended. Still baffled to be honest, but maybe it was for the best. Hoping I’ll see the good in this one day.

Thank you so much to everyone that responded, and happy new year lovelies :)

1kznrvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1kznrvu/has_anyone_else_felt_really_alone_during_wedding/,Has anyone else felt really alone during wedding planning?,"Before we got engaged, my fiancé and I always said we’d elope. I never dreamed of a big wedding growing up, and he’s very private. But once we got engaged, I realized I did want a wedding - something small and intimate, but still special. He wasn’t totally against it, but definitely not excited either.

Things got tricky fast. My parents have contributed to my siblings weddings, brothers and sisters, so I assumed both sides would help. But when I asked about his family, he said they wouldn’t be contributing at all, that it’s “not traditional” for them. I understand not everyone has financial support, and I’m grateful for mine, but it’s hard knowing his parents could help and just won’t. And he’s adamantly against even asking.

Planning has felt like pulling teeth. I’ve asked multiple times to sit down together at a coffee shop and just talk through what we need to get done. He always pushes it off or says he needs a list and can’t just go there to “brainstorm”. I’ve never planned a wedding what the heck do I know? I figured we’d build a list together. Since then I’ve handled most of it myself- from guest lists to rehearsal dinner research to making our website and invitations. When I asked for his guest list, he eventually gave me a Post-it note. And then it took him another couple weeks to actually get me addresses.

We’re getting married in my hometown (3 hours away). I get the sense he feels like it’s a burden on his family, but it’s a small group of people we love—and I’d make that trip for any of them. I’ve also tried to include him in things like suit shopping, but he canceled our appointment bc we got on each other nerves that day and then when I’ve brought it up again he said that I can’t go since he can’t see my dress so I can’t see his suit. He said it jokingly, but that stung, I was looking forward to sharing that experience with him.

Lastly, when I brought up the idea of personal vows-just the two of us, since I know he doesn’t love being the center of attention-he was very against it. He said, “We’re already doing traditional vows, so why do we need more?” When I told him it felt important to me, he replied, “Isn’t the whole wedding day already a symbol of our love?”

He went to Precana with me, proofread and complimented the website and invitations I created, which makes me feel like he does care, even if he’s not super involved in every detail. On top of everything, we’re also in the middle of a major house renovation, which I know is a huge stressor for him and I’ve been actively helping with that too. It’s a lot for both of us, and I’m trying to keep that in mind.

We’re only having 50 guests, but it’s still been a huge emotional and logistical lift. I feel like I’m drowning in the details while trying to hold onto the joy of it all. I’m excited for the day itself, but the planning process has just felt draining and disappointing.

1kznnwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/JaackMaate/comments/1kznnwe/heres_a_fan_fiction/,Here’s a fan fiction,"Title: “The Happy Hour Heist”

It was supposed to be a regular Thursday recording.

Jaack showed up ten minutes late to the studio, coffee in one hand and a suspiciously large duffel bag in the other. Stevie was already sitting at the mic, bouncing a stress ball and trying not to laugh at the fact Robbie had somehow spilled Monster on his notes. Again.

“Right, boys,” Jaack said, dropping the bag with a theatrical thud. “Today’s podcast is going to be… different.”

Robbie looked up, eyebrows raised. “What’ve you done?”

Stevie leaned in, suddenly interested. “Is this the time you finally bring on a surprise guest? Please say it’s Danny Dyer.”

“No,” Jaack grinned. “Better.”

He unzipped the bag and pulled out three matching balaclavas, a crumpled map of London, and what looked like a child’s toy walkie-talkie.

“We’re doing a heist.”

Silence.

“Jaack,” Stevie said slowly, “this is a podcast.”

“Yes,” Jaack replied. “But what if… it wasn’t?”



Later that day.

Armed with only their microphones, balaclavas, and dangerously poor planning, the Happy Hour boys embarked on the “heist” of the century: stealing back a limited edition Shrek 2 promotional DVD Jaack claimed he loaned to a mysterious YouTuber years ago who never returned it.

Their mission: break into the back of a West London vintage shop where the DVD was now proudly on display.

Their plan: improvise.

“I’ll distract the owner,” said Robbie, adjusting his hat like a proper heist man. “Stevie, you grab the DVD. Jaack, you… record it for the Patreon tier.”

Stevie nodded. “I’ve always wanted to be the guy in the chair.”

“You are the guy in the chair,” Jaack muttered. “Except the chair’s on fire.”



Twenty minutes later.

“Abort, ABORT!” Robbie yelled, sprinting out of the shop with a confused-looking Jack Grealish bobblehead instead of a DVD.

Stevie followed, arms full of Shrek memorabilia. “I panicked!”

Jaack was last, filming the chaos while laughing so hard the footage was mostly his trainers.

They reconvened in the alley behind the shop, breathless and shaking with laughter.

“Well,” Jaack panted, “we didn’t get the DVD… but we did get content.”

Stevie held up a cracked walkie-talkie. “And a new episode title: How We Accidentally Committed a Crime for Shrek.”

Robbie groaned. “We’re definitely getting sued.”



Back in the studio, one week later.

“So welcome back to Happy Hour,” Jaack said, smirking at the camera. “Today we’re talking about the greatest heist that never happened.”

Stevie pulled out the Shrek bobblehead and set it on the table with reverence. “And this, ladies and gentlemen, is our trophy.”

Robbie sighed. “Next time we’re doing a normal episode.”

Jaack raised an eyebrow. “Next time… we’re stealing the Bee Movie script.”

Peace & wellness, Earth family 🌍✨

If you've ever walked barefoot through the grass, you’ve probably stepped over one of the **most powerful herbal allies in nature** — the **dandelion**.

Too often treated as a “weed,” dandelion is actually a **deeply respected medicinal plant** used across continents for healing the liver, supporting digestion, and restoring balance to the body. From its sunny flowers to its bitter roots, every part of this plant is medicine.

Let’s reclaim the magic of this wildflower — because dandelion isn’t just background greenery. It’s **Earth’s detoxifier**.

# 🌍 Where Dandelion Comes From

Dandelion (*Taraxacum officinale*) is native to **Europe and Asia**, but it now grows all over the world — thriving in fields, cracks in sidewalks, and anywhere the Earth is alive and breathing.

Its name comes from the French **“dent de lion”** — *lion’s tooth* — referring to the jagged edges of its leaves 🦁🍃.

For centuries, dandelion has been used in:

* **Traditional Chinese Medicine** – for liver detoxification, inflammation, and infections
* **Ayurveda** – to cool and cleanse the liver and skin
* **European Folk Medicine** – as a spring tonic for digestion and sluggishness
* **Indigenous Medicine** – as a sacred plant for urinary, digestive, and heart health

It’s no coincidence this plant grows **where people need healing** — dandelion is a true Earth doctor.

# 🌿 Health Benefits of Dandelion

From **root to flower**, dandelion offers full-body nourishment. It’s bitter, yes — but bitters are **incredibly important** for modern bodies dealing with over-processed, overstimulated diets and lifestyles.

Here’s what dandelion does:

✅ **Liver Detoxifier** – Supports healthy bile flow, helps the liver filter waste  
✅ **Digestive Aid** – Stimulates digestion and relieves bloating  
✅ **Kidney & Urinary Support** – Acts as a gentle diuretic to flush toxins  
✅ **Blood Cleanser** – Helps move lymph and detoxify the blood  
✅ **Rich in Nutrients** – Contains vitamin A, C, K, iron, calcium, and potassium  
✅ **Anti-inflammatory** – Great for chronic inflammation and skin issues  
✅ **Supports Skin Health** – By helping clear the liver, it indirectly clears acne and eczema  
✅ **Balances Blood Sugar** – May help regulate glucose and insulin levels

🌼 Spiritually, dandelion is a symbol of **resilience, adaptability, and release**. It teaches us to root deep, rise bright, and let go of what no longer serves.

# 🍵 How to Prepare Dandelion (Root, Leaf, Flower)

# ✨ 1. Dandelion Root Tea (Deep Detoxifier)

**Use**: Best for liver and digestive support

**Instructions**:

1. Use 1–2 tsp of dried, roasted dandelion root
2. Simmer in 1 cup of water for 15–20 minutes
3. Strain and drink 1–2x per day before meals

💡Roasted dandelion root also makes a great **coffee alternative** — rich, bitter, grounding.

# ✨ 2. Dandelion Leaf Tea (Gentle Diuretic)

**Use**: Best for kidney support, water retention, and skin health

**Instructions**:

1. Steep 1 tsp of dried dandelion leaf in hot water for 10 minutes
2. Strain and sip — lightly bitter, slightly grassy
3. Great as a morning tea or before heavy meals

# ✨ 3. Dandelion Flower Infusion (Sunny & Uplifting)

**Use**: Gentle mood lift, skin health, infused oils

**Instructions**:

* Steep fresh or dried yellow dandelion petals in hot water for 10–15 minutes
* Or infuse the flowers in oil (like olive or sunflower) and apply topically to sore muscles or skin rashes

🌼 Bonus: Dandelion flower salve is amazing for dry skin and joints!

# ✨ Quick Harvest Tips:

* Only harvest from unsprayed areas (no pesticides or lawn treatments)
* Rinse well — especially the roots, which may have soil and grit
* Dry leaves and flowers in a shaded area to preserve nutrients
* Roots are best harvested in fall when energy is stored deep in the plant

# 🧘🏾‍♀️ Rooted Reflection

Dandelion reminds us: **healing doesn’t have to be exotic.** It can be humble, scrappy, and growing right underfoot. In a world obsessed with rare superfoods, dandelion brings us back to the basics — **bitterness, simplicity, and grounded strength.**

It’s a plant that shows up when you need to **cleanse, release, and restart**. The more you clear out what’s stuck (emotionally, physically, energetically), the more you make room for new growth — just like this bright yellow bloom.

So next time you see a dandelion, don’t pull it. **Harvest it. Honor it. Heal with it.**

**Have you worked with dandelion before? What’s your favorite way to use it — tea, tincture, salad, or salve? Drop your stories and ancestral wisdom below 🌼💛**

Describe the type of drink ware: the material, brand, size, shape, standout features, etc. Then share why it’s your favorite drink ware for drinking pour over coffee at home!

I am looking to do a 72 hour fast to try to heal some minor ailments in my body and just overall reset dopamine, etc.

I am a coffee addict, can I have any coffee at all on day one? Or possibly take some of a caffeine pill to avoid a bad caffeine headache? I am looking to cut down caffeine for the day before or so to try to cut down on caffeine withdrawal effects.

How much water should I drink daily? Should I put any lemon or anything in my water? 
I drink vinegar in my water every morning on an empty (well, coffee only) stomach. Should I avoid my vinegar water during the fast? 

I just got back into working out often. Kinda trying to bulk. Should I avoid working out for a few days in advance? Can I go for walks or should I really stay low, low impact? 

Also, any advice for not being in a bad mood and having to cook for family members during the fast? Not looking forward to that.. 

I am just trying to reach full stem cell producing potential on this fast. Any insight will help, thanks! ",3,1748662653.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

If you’re a girl in Hyderabad who’s down for a chill coffee, casual convo, and a completely non-creepy, kidney-safe meet-up — let’s make it happen.

No pressure, no weird expectations. Just two humans chatting over coffee, preferably in a nice public café where the Wi-Fi is weak but the vibes are strong.

If you enjoy sarcastic banter, have a soft spot for coffee shop playlists, and wouldn’t mind laughing at my failed dating app stories — drop a message 🙂

I am working at a café and i would like you all to advise me or share your thoughts with this situation i am facing. It's my first time working at a café and i would like to know if i was the AH or not. Thank you 🩷.

It happened last night and it happens often actually but I'll just share what i have experience last night. For context i don't usually make eye contact to customers i don't know if this was due to me being an introvert or else i haven't really got myself checked out.  But i do talk with professionalism.

We are having a busy night and we were close to closing. Our cafe closes at 9 and by 8:30 we are only Available for take outs to make time for cleaning and making everything's ready for the morning shifts. Somewhere 8:05  a woman and her son walk in to take an order it was worth PHp275 (~$4.25). She handed me a PHp 1,000 (~$10). When didn't have any smaller bills and coins at this time since previous customers paid thru e-payments or also bigger bills. I told her that. I ask her that she can have her bill change at the convenience store nearby and come back and we'll get ready her drinks while she do that. 

Her response was it should be us go in that convenience store that have her money changed (in a mocking way or entitled way). (I lokked at her confused)(My face is an open book so i can't really stop my face from showing my thoughts 🥲)I told her that i cannot do that since i was the only cashier and only one kitchen staff was available. And i lower my head to write something and was playing with my pen while waiting for her decision. And she decided to cancel her order.
Even if we have an extra hand should we be th one to go out our way to get a bill change?

When this kind of things happen i don't easily get over from it. It stays on my mind and asking myself am i wrong?. Should i just did what she ask?. So i am humbly asking You all who works at cafe or coffee shops what did you do in this kind of situation. And from a point of Customers were also appreciated.

Enlightened me as i am an inexperienced and needs advice how to handle this kind of situation in the future. ",1,1748662379.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

Breath it in caregivers! There is nothing better than those few hours after everyone asleep , movie playing, the gentle humm of O2 generator and bedsore mattresss compressor!   The smell of fresh ground coffee that drowns out the odors of the back rooms.

Then I started feeling dizzy then got this weird sharp feeling in my legs and knew I had to pull over, my heart rate was going crazy and I tried calming myself, it’s been over an hour now I feel somewhat better but still scared since I had a scare like this last year and had to take medications with the doctors.

1kzn8je,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kzn8je/fast_offering_routes/,Fast Offering Routes,"Okay the other night I was thinking of my experience growing up in the heart of Morridor during the late 90s/early 2000s. In 96 or 97 I was the Deacon’s quorum president, and thus put in charge of the Fast Offering routes. We had to put the light blue envelopes with the security Velcro into the dark blue pouches with the security zipper, figure out which routes made the most sense, and then assign the routes to the 11 deacons and 6 teachers (or whoever was there on a fast Sunday). 

The temperature was always either blistering hot, or mind-numbing cold. And we had to go out and walk the neighborhood and ask people for money. After three hours of being guilted and bored to death on Starve and Tell Your Story Sunday. 

It’s just wild to me that this was a thing. That they put kids in charge of it, that we never stole anything, that we agreed to do it, and how seriously most of us took it. Because I took it seriously. I remember a route wasn’t done by someone even though I had assigned it to him (uh, yeah. Obviously, I gave myself the apartments and him the farm houses. The farm houses took forever. Apartments you could knock out in 20 minutes. But I was the President and therefore deserved the posh route🙄). I don’t remember exactly how it happened but we came close to throwing down. His brother had to step in and maybe drive him to make sure it got done? Details aren’t important, but I had it in my head that this was the most important thing we would do all month, and he was just half assing it, and it filled me with self-righteous anger. So stupid. 

As I think about it, I’m beginning to think that this was one of the ways they groomed us as kids. “You’re important, a noble generation,” they’d tell me. “They’ll let me gather the money. They trust me. The things they tell me must be true. I am great and noble…” I’d think. Thoughts like that build obedient foot soldiers that go on missions, recruit more suckers, pay their tithing, make babies, and keep the cycle going. 

Unless of course we break the cycle, drink alcohol, try weed, drink coffee, get tattoos and realize that joy, <whispers>true joy, has been around us all the time. And no. My 13 year old son isn’t roller blading around the neighborhood collecting money. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

I always loved games ever since I remember but no other woman I know in real life play games. (I have met female gamers online though, but even so I would say it's like 80%-20% ratio between male and female).

I live in a budget friendly apartment complex, roaches have been a major issue. I've been fighting them to no success. We had a massive infestation of both fruit flies and roaches. At this point, I've gotten used to these pests. One day, I accidentally left coffee out mixed with artificial sweetener. I noticed a significant death rate of fruit flies in my coffee, so I left it out 3 extra days and the fruit flies were completely dead. Took a spoon full and laid it on the ground where the roaches like to hide, I haven't seen a single one since. I suggest anyone to test this out for yourself. Google backs this up too. This may be a better way to control pests in agriculture/farming. I highly support you people to test this out yourself and either agree or disagree in the comments. Personally, I'd rather our society use artificial sweeteners as a pesticide over whatever else they have been using. Please PLEASE take on this knowledge and post your findings, good or bad. Thanks! 🙏💯
*I cannot remember which brand I used but I always use either STEVIA or SWEET N LOW!! :)

*Edit. A friendly commenter did mention it could just be the coffee! I suggest trying it in water first. If you have an infestation, try the water method and then use the coffee if it doesn't work.

1kzmzce,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1kzmzce/finding_sustainable_cure_for_lpr_after_several/,Finding sustainable cure for LPR after several failures,"Recently, I’ve experienced a significant improvement in my LPR symptoms, and I wanted to share what I’ve learned from past failure.

I’ve suffered from a persistent tickling sensation deep inside my right clavicle whenever I speak nearly 10 years. Just last month, things got so emotionally overwhelming that I found myself having very dark thoughts.

I had previously tried to follow Acid Watcher Diet and reduce my acid intake, but I always failed to sustain it. 

The reason was that avoiding spicy, sour, fried, and many common foods led to rapid weight loss and I really hated how I looked when I lost too much weight. 

And furthermore losing tasty food in daily life made me depressed. I mean.. most beverages sold at grocery stores are acidic, and even though I knew that, I couldn’t easily stop drinking them. Fruit juice comforted me when I was annoyed from a sore throat. Giving them up felt as hard for me as it is for a typical office worker to quit coffee. 

So I gone through so many success and failure process like this below 

Stop all beverage and hot, fried food ⭢ symptoms improved but lose too much weight and joy of eating ⭢ Fuck off. I will eat and drink whatever I want ⭢ Sore throat again

But recently, I started focusing on replacements. I used to be afraid of losing weight, which kept me from managing my diet properly. But thanks to GPT, I found eating avocados helps for LPR sufferers. They’re gentle on the esophagus and don’t cause weight loss(Of course there's exception)

And I found some appropriate food which is good for LPR and have decent taste such as smoked salmon and boiled eggs. Also I started eating alkaline fruits like watermelon instead of fruit juices. And instead of deep-fried chicken, I go for lightly pan-fried versions. This way, I’ve managed to maintain my weight and drastically improve my esophageal health. 

For the first time yesterday, I actually began to believe that complete healing might be possible.
 
I know fighting with LPR is horrible. But Finding sustainable replacement food might be good tactics for LPR sufferers. Thank you.",4,1748660679.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I have had an ultrasound as well and everything was normal. My bloodwork obviously shows extremely low estrogen levels. I developed an eating disorder when I was 12 but went into recovery pretty quickly afterwards (I was only fully actively engaging in my eating disorder for maybe 4 months). Since then I have been on at least some form of meal plan. I even drank ensure plus drinks for 5 years. Even during my ED, I never skipped a meal. Despite my best efforts to gain weight, it's been very difficult due to my fast metabolism. I think it has something to do with the fact that I never fully went through puberty so my body still ""thinks"" I'm growing. Right now, I eat 4 meals and 1 snack per day. I make sure to eat within 30 minutes of waking up, I don't drink coffee or caffeine, I don't do much exercise, and I eat tons of healthy fats and lots of carbs. For example, I eat peanut butter at least once daily, eat full avocados regularly, and cook with butter and/or oil. I also eat lots of eggs, fruit, some veggies, as well as nuts and seeds. All in all, I eat a very balanced and consistent diet.

This morning I went to grab a coffee and go for an early morning walk. There's a war memorial just around the corner from where I live, commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives in WW2. I stood and looked at all the names and thought to myself, if they had known what the future would look like, this degenerate unhinged society, would they have bothered to stand up and fight? What exactly was it that they gave their lives for? Not for this. It was only 2 generations ago, blood was shed for freedom. Not freedom to be woke, but freedom from oppression. ^This^ is oppression in a very different form, wearing a different face, but it is oppression nonetheless. 

Seriously, what would our Grandparents say if they saw this? I am sure every single one of them would say that this is not the future they envisioned for their descendants.

1kzmx8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1kzmx8f/i_scheduled_my_masturbation_sessions_to_hit_200/,I scheduled my masturbation sessions to hit 200 orgasms in May. It accidentally improved my life.,"May is the International Masturbation Month. I set myself a personal challenge to do 200 orgasms in May. That's 200 individual wanks in a month.

That goes to be around 6,45 orgasms per day. And you don’t get those kinds of numbers without dedication. Or planning for that sake.

After some days, I realized that spontaneous sessions weren’t going to cut it. I was already falling behind. So I did what any responsible adult would do: I made a schedule. Looking back I should have known better. When I did the 12 in 24 hour challenge, I had to schedule my wanks to accomplish it.

So I wrote down approxemently times in my calendar like it was a workout plan:

* 07:30: ""Good morning Creampuff""
* 10:15: ""After coffee release""
* 13:00: "" Lunchpie""
* 16:00: ""Productivity Booster""
* 19:30: ""Evening load into Creampuff""
* 22:30: ""The Goodnight wank""

And sometimes a 3AM I got the ""the wet dream"" experience.

My Fleshlight, Creampuff, eventually started asking for vacation days. I denied here request.

It worked. Not just for the challenge (which I’m on track to complete). But for my actual life also. I got more things done. I got less anxious because I knew what was coming for me each day. I started eating regularly (witch is good for me). I even cleaned my home sometimes in the waiting period.

Scheduling my orgasms actually gave me a reason to structure my day. I woke up earlier with motivation to do my ""job"". I don't have to job right now so that was nice. And somehow, in the middle of all this May challange chaos, I have became a better version of myself.

Im proud of myself today. I am really nailing this challenge and I don't care what anyone else think about this achievement. Stop hiding things that make you feel good.

TL;dr: Aiming for the 200 orgasms in May challenge. Started scheduling them like meetings. Accidentally improved my mental health, productivity, and daily routine. I don't give a fuck what you think of this achievement.",2,1748660493.0,copypasta,2,0.67,False

1kzmwu4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzmwu4,I just finished dragrace UK season 2 and…,"Holy ****. Why was that the best season I’ve ever watched? Uhm… I have a million opinions, as I normally do LOL

((spoilers ahead))

Joe Black:: Woah?? Uhm… was so not expecting them to be first boot. Shook boots.

Cherry Valentine:: I really loved her personality and wish she could’ve gotten another round. The gag is— Tia Kofi should’ve been in the bottom this round anyways so… Unfortunate. Also, love that you’re a nurse bb, do your thing ❤️

Astina:: …. no seriously… gagged bitch. I was living for her and at this point of the competition, my winner picks were her and Lawrence. This was a shock but like also… wtf were you doing in that lipsync girl.. made me expect tricks and flips and death drop extravaganza but… as it played out I honestly still didn’t think it mattered. I figured Tia was out regardless. Ru really gagged me with this one. I hope to see her on an all stars.

Ginny Lemon:: I wish you would’ve just lip synced, like cmon. This was no where near Ben Dela Crème level, this was just… :///. I did like her though, especially when she put on pads and tits for the first time. But the cast is thinning babes— and unfortunately she was not ready to compete against the rest.

Veronica Green:: can’t wait to see you next season girlie— I was so excited for you to continue but now you have some time to polish yourself. I’m expecting perfection babes… see you soon💋

Episode Five:: (enter Joe Black) Yeah so this episode was fire, it needs its own review. UKD crushed it and I’m actually disappointed we couldn’t get critiques on the winners lewks. But what a phenomenal way to return after seven months— Ru’s crash out?? NO H&M, I’m crying.

Joe Black pt2:: So for me, it’s one of two things. Either he’s truly just delusional and everyone around him feeds into this delusion OR… he’s just from a different type/era of drag. He clearly exudes the confidence of someone who should perform well/ do well. Something’s not adding up and it has to be that the rest of the cast is more “this day and age drag”. And not just his wardrobe, but the way he lipsyncs and performs and sings. Does that make sense? I wouldn’t mind seeing him again, but seriously.. NO H&M!!!

Tia Kofi:: I have a lot to say but I want to keep it sweet. Keep in mind I just binged this okay. But Tia Kofi was… not my cup of tea. Or coffee. Listen, the bitch was funny, yes. Her confessionals made me laugh and her underdog story was fun— until it wasn’t anymore. In a way, I understood Awhoras frustration when saying “I’m watching all these amazing queens leave and Tias still here” Like yeah… kinda very much that. Gag it. BUTTTT before you crucify me, I would live for her to return and learn how to work her body. If she came back and could turn a lewk. Over.

Sister Sister:: No shade but… I just never vibed with this Queen. I did LOVE her entrance lips, I thought it was fun and unique but she didn’t wow me after that. And then she came back with some of the heaviest drag delusion of the season, idk. If I saw her again, she’d really need to wow me.

A’Whora:: NOOOOOO so sad, especially her and Tayce against each other.. the queens left are sooooo good at this point, I see why she was sent home. Does anyone know what she actually said during her standup? Anyway— I love that she was the cunty, messy queen of the season. She truly was like if.. Adore +. Valentina + Violet Chachki all had a three way baby in the UK. That would be Awhora and bitch was she fierce. Neeeeed her on all stars ASAP.

Ellie Diamond:: Girl… give her a couple years. This bitch can PAINT bitch like, wow. It was just unfortunate that her looks (even though she spent a good portion of the completions in or near the top) never were able to beat out another queens. She was always just a bit short. But if she had time bitch— pls. It’s over for everyone.

Tayce:: This bitch was THAT bitch through and through this season. I absolutely lived for her and basically anything that came out of her mouth. Fierce yet nice and congenial (it seems). I would think she’d win Miss Congeniality but also idk. I need her and Awhora on all starts together pronto.

Bimini Bon Boulash:: Crushed. No shade, I wanted her to win so bad 😭😭 Listen. As I said in my first Joe Black comment— I was rooting for Joe in that first lipsync against Bimini. I didn’t exactly care for her in the first few episodes (even though her confessionals made me laugh). But something happened over that break bitch.. because I could not keep a smile off my face when she was on the screen. Her confessionals cracked me up, her comedy was genius, and she had such an upward trajectory. I thought she’d win. Truly. But now— bitch, you’re all star material henny. And also my personal fav of the season.

Lawrence Cheney:: Two words. Criminally hilarious. Like seriously, why is this bitch so casually funny in basically everything they say? No but, Lawrence clearly won the heart of Ru (and me) early on and was a clear front runner. I wasn’t surprised by her win at all. Deserved? Yes. Impressed? Yes. But did I kinda want Bimini to win? Also yes.

-

Final Thoughts:: Just wow. Yall weren’t lying when you said this season was top tier. The level of drag.. the stiffness of competition.. the gag worthy moments.. truly an incredible season. THIS IS WHAT DRAGRACE SHOULD BE EVERY SEASON. Chefs motherfuckin kiss.

Catch ya next season babes, no spoilers 🥂

We now have a romantic ace partner and I'm worried it will end our marriage if he doesn't figure it out.","Writing here because I love the podcast, and I'm fairly certain nobody else in the house listens, so it's less likely to be seen by my husband. The details are specific enough that if anybody who knows us sees this, they would know immediately 😬. I'm sorry if I ramble a bit, but MAN do I need somebody to confirm I'm not crazy and commiserate a bit.

My (28 they/she) husband (30M) has always been in a closet made of glass. We got together before I had come out as bisexual and nonbinary, and others had told me they were surprised because they truly thought he was gay. Our early relationship was a whirlwind of a story on its own, as we had met in the military and had a courthouse wedding after 6 months to stay near each other with the understanding that we could easily divorce if things went south. We are now going on a decade together, nearing 9 years of marriage, and for all we have been through together and love each other I am still not convinced this man is as cishet as he thinks.

Now, my husband is a sweetheart, the kind of guy that women who are afraid of men actually feel safe with immediately. At parties I have described him as a bundle of light and gotten sage nods of agreement. We all also agree he's biromantic as hell and in denial.

The top evidence is as follows:

1) He has drunkenly made out with at least 3x as many guys as I have people. He says it's funny, says he's confident in his masculinity and sexuality, and especially does it to freak out homophobes into leaving the party. This was mostly in our early 20's when we were the party hosts.

2) When I came out as nonbinary, he helped me with the transition at every stage. When I wanted to shave my head, he held the shaver. When I wanted to wear more mens' clothes, he shared his (and was annoyed I wore them better). It was never a question of whether or not we'd stay together. I have jokingly told him this makes him an honorary bisexual, and he just shrugged and said he loves me for me.

3) We share types. When watching shows together, we will often discuss who's hottest, and he doesn't keep to women. I'm talking in-depth discussions about Lucifer or Alucard. We also overlap types with women. It's been fun, if a touch aggravating when he loops back to saying he's fully straight.

Life has happened, we have settled down a lot, built our village, have a kid (5 yr old) together, bought a house, etc. He's the love of my life and my best friend. I still cannot fathom him being fully straight.

Now, we had a roommate back when we very first got together (32M, let's call him John) who we both loved living with. Not only was John a genuinely nice guy, but he's the type that stress cleans and stress cooks, and we both reminisced over the years about coming home to the smell of pasta and banana bread and going into comfort mode for our friend. (On a side note, John and my husband regularly got confused as a couple, and me as a sister). We've stayed in touch, my husband and I worrying about the abusive on and off again ex that John struggled with, and discussing how much both of us missed the dynamic of living with him. So we decided to invite John to Thanksgiving and catch up. It turned out that John had since come out as ace and biromantic, was finally separated from the abusive ex, and also missed living with us.

On top of this, John and my autistic kid (then 3 and nonverbal) clicked immediately, something that was wildly rare to see. We would quickly find out John and I are also on the spectrum, as are many of our friends, and joke my ADHD husband likes to collect queer autistics.

After a few days of catching up, it came up that all three of us missed living together, housing is too expensive for John to live alone, he needs people, and everything felt right. We decided to give it a try and move John into our third bedroom, with a semi-platonic, semi-romantic relationship. We discussed boundaries, and were all on the same page: 
We all like to cuddle.
We all like to do small things for each other to show we care (think making coffee for each other, talking about our days, shoulder massages).
We all like to go out, be it to movies or dinner, and spend time together.

The trouble is that while John and I agree that it's a very straightforward romantic-but-nonsexual relationship between the three of us, my husband does not see any of that as romance. Cuddling, going out together, even a forehead kiss goodnight could be ""what the homies do"" to him. He refuses to accept that it's not just friendship+ (which is fair I guess?). This explains why he believes he is straight: he's heterosexual, and if he doesn't accept romantic sh*t as romance, then there's nothing to say otherwise.

After more than a year, John has become a third parent and a full partner, and we are buying a bigger house for all four of us. John and I are baffled by husband's insistence that there's no romance between them. Worse, the closer we all get, the more husband is having to confront his own feelings about it, and it feels as though he's just as likely to pull away altogether to avoid processing his own feelings as he is finally just admitting it.

We've even had moments where John was discussing attraction to a character and said ""straight men don't know what they're missing"" and my husband said ""they absolutely don't"". We are banging our heads on the wall trying to get this man past his emotional constipation and into that pink-purple-and-blue pride gear.

Meanwhile I am terrified. I love both of these idiots, and want both of them to be happy, but John is anxious about husband's unwillingness to talk it out (this also being a first for John since coming out), and husband is getting defensive, leaving me feeling like I can't be a fair partner to either of them.

Beyond which, it hurts sometimes that my husband is so insistent on being ""straight"", because it's allowed people to say he only sees me as a woman, and I will never be anything but. I worry if I get top surgery, or if I tried HRT for a short time to deepen my voice and be more androgynous, would there be a limit to his attraction? Would we just become friends and co-parents? Would I risk losing the love of my life for a relatively small piece of comfort when I'm okay with the social transition?

Part of me just wishes I could hit undo or load an old save. To go back where his denial was only a slight eye-roll annoyance at times, and I didn't feel anxiety for our marriage at every turn. Hell, part of me wished I was cishet myself and monogamous and allistic and *not me*. This man has seen me through sickness and health, cared for me while I recovered from a minor brain injury, pushed me to be a better version of myself, supported me in becoming a published author, loved me when I could barely love myself, and been an amazing dad to an amazingly smart kid (who was reading at 2 yrs old, and has finally started speaking). But now we also have John in our lives, and for the long run. There's no undo. There's only moving forward and figuring it out, and I can't figure out their feelings for them.

I'm exhausted. During all of this I'm also struggling with learning I may have both narcolepsy and either a connective tissue disorder or autoimmune disorder that is tearing apart my body with compiled injuries. I'm physically, emotionally, spiritually, metaphorically and literally, wildly exhausted. I'm trapped by a gov't that wants me disappeared on multiple levels, and trying to figure out if my kid will still have access to an education next year. Even a little piece of validation in my feelings would be huge.

TL:DR: I believe my husband is biromantic, but he hasn't separated romance vs sexuality. Even though we have an ace romantic partner, he still refuses to face his feelings and just keeps polishing the glass door of the closet. I'm at a complete loss.

Edit to add: I would be totally fine with no labels, with ""it is what it is"". What's concerning to John and I is his insistence that he is straight while being in an inherently not-straight relationship.

I added him on Facebook, he reached me out and told me to add him on instagram then tried to call I ignored him then texted me via WhatsApp and said he has feelings, and quickly asked to meet. On social media He seemed confident and open, but I'm reserved and cautious.

During the date:
He showed up in traditional clothes, His body language was reserved and intense, He didn’t flirt overtly or joke excessively. Instead, he observed, asked deep questions, and was visibly nervous —
He asked me to remove his necklace from his hand (weird test?), then gave a light high five.
He opened up fast—talked about his ex-fiancée, culture, marriage, to much questions about my family, etc.
I stayed calm, didn’t overshare, and joked lightly but kept distance. 

At the end, he opend the car door silently didn’t make a flirty or casual goodbye, and reacted with internal conflict when i said “Have fun” — no smooth line or exit joke. Just silence and tension. I said “Have fun,” and he just nodded quietly.

After the date:
I messaged him politely next day"" hi it was nice to meet you, thanks for the coffee!""—he replied a day later with ""hi my pleasure.. see you again soon:)""
. Then he got quiet. I removed him from Instagram. He reacted on Facebook with symbolic stories and started posting old family pics + his pics with kids.
He never reached out again. But he still watches from afar—no messages.

Ice Breakers. The moment I taste one, sharp and cold on my tongue, it’s like you’re next to me again. That crisp sweetness, like the way you kiss me mid-sentence, like the way you smell when you lean in too close. I swear, they taste like you. Bright, cool, unforgettable. And just like you, they stay with me long after they’re gone.


Shoes make me think of you too, which sounds stupid unless you knew you once tied mine so tight I swore you were trying to keep me tethered to you. Maybe you were. Or maybe you were just trying to keep me grounded. It’s funny because you’re an electrician, so maybe that’s exactly what you were doing. Keeping me grounded to you. I didn’t untie them for hours. They left a mark, but so did you.


Then there’s your guitar. God, the way you play. Like the strings owe you something. Like the music is trying to confess what your mouth won’t say. Sometimes I just listen, because I swear I can hear your soul bleeding out through the chords. And every time, it hits me how lucky I am to know a boy who sings with his hands.


Your eyes are blue. Not dark blue, not storm blue, but glacier blue. They’ve wrecked me gently a hundred times over. The color blue is ruined for me now, in the most beautiful way. I’ll never see it without thinking of you.


The stars remind me of you. The moon too. You told me once that you love space, the mysteries behind it. And now every time I look up, I think of you. I make wishes on falling stars like they know who you are. Like they already agree.


The smell of coffee hits me like a freight train. Not just because you drink it, but because of those coffee-flavored nicotine pouches. The scent clings to your clothes and settles in my lungs like a second heartbeat. Coffee doesn’t just wake me up anymore. It makes me ache for you.


And pink flowers… God, don’t even get me started on pink flowers. You picked one once. And not just a flower. A whole plant. Ripped the whole thing right from the garden box outside of an Outback Steakhouse on our first date. Flowers, roots, soil and all. You put it in a can so it wouldn’t get dirt in my car on the way home. I still have it. I treat it like a diamond.
I keep that memory pressed between the pages of my mind like it’ll die if I let it breathe.

All of it… mints, shoes, guitars, colors, stars, flowers… none of it means anything on its own. But together? They form this soft mosaic of what you are to me. And saying “I love you” feels like such a lie. It’s too small. Too shallow.


I don’t love you. I exist because of you. I inhale reminders of you like oxygen. I carry you in every sense, every breath, every beat.
Love is just the beginning.


You’re the reason even ice-cold mints feel like warmth.

I was hoping for anyone to share any tips or success stories on lifestyle/dietary changes that made a significant change for them. I lost my health insurance and now the costs for dermatology/medications is too much for me (which initially helped), and I've spent probably thousands on skin care products. I've finally gotten the dryness under control, but there is nothing that has brought down the inflammation or pustules. Basically I am desperate for any non-expensive changes I can make in my life that *might* give me a chance at clearing my face.

Alcohol and spicy foods seem to be my main triggers, although my face is constantly red at baseline. For the changes I've tried to make, I can go months without drinking alcohol, I've gone weeks without adding any spice to my food, and I drink iced coffee without any sugar or creamer. But overall my diet is awful and I am pretty inconsistent with exercise. I was thinking about doing a 30 day 'cleanse', but I was hoping for some tips on what I should prioritize including in my diet, if there are any supplements that work, or if anyone has actually seen progress with just lifestyle changes.

And I also want to make steamed milk, but I dont know if there is a separate tool to steam the milk. I looked something up and I don't know if it will work for my purposes but is this good?

now, i would like to use this for latte art and such, and I dont know if this is the right product.

Also, I would need probably a grinder and maybe glasses and stuff, if someone could recommend ones that i could get, that would be great. I don't even know if the espresso machine i'm looking at is good, but it needs to be on a budget, same with the milk steamer, grinder, and glasses. Is there anything else that I would need for this?

How do I not blindside him if I leave him?,"So this is going to be a long one so I'm sorry about this. 
TL;DR: Been engaged to a great guy and we've been together over 8.5 years. But I'm having second thoughts and am considering leaving. But I'm worried about blindsiding him and ruining his birthday which is coming up soon. 

Here's some background information. I (31F) have been in a relationship with my fiancé (37M) for 8.5 years. We were official since the tail end of November 2016. Anyway, he is a great and wonderful man. He treats me like such a queen here. He is very nice, kind, and such a gentleman. He is also very romantic and such a gentleman. Like he will always walk me to my ride whenever we go out on dates if I have a ride bring me to see him, and he always pulls a chair out for me. Hell, he even did that on our first date, and he even read me a cute poem on that same first date as well which made me swoon. He also always does things like tell me to get home safely, give me thoughtful gifts such as jewelry, a few stuffed animals, flowers, chocolates and even some little souvenirs whenever he went on trips (and I think he even gave me some little crafts he made when he went to this camp for adults too. He even gave me his late grandmother's bracelet and a couple old t-shirts of his) when expected like on birthdays, holidays, etc. Even give me gifts just because. He is also very supportive and physically affectionate too. He is also a very supportive guy. And he tells me he loves me every day. And this is a big one; he was also willing to take it slow and never pushed me for sex. He seems like a dream man and a lot of women would kill to have a man like him. 

Now here is where I'm having doubts and thinking about breaking up. He ALWAYS wants and expects my mother to come pick him up with her car to drive us to dates and even to my house occasionally, if we're not meeting up at the coffee and donut place across from his house or the pizza place or bagel place that's on the same street. Now, he cannot drive due to a disability which I don't have a problem with.  (I also am unable to drive due to me being blind in one eye.) But he never wants to make an effort to use his own transportation. I suggested that he use the public bus but he says his uncle won't let him go on his own and it bothers me so much. He also won't take the public bus to my town because it takes around 3  hours to get from his house to mine which is fair.

However, I know he could use the para transit bus services for disabled people to go around to different places and they'd drop him off and pick him up from his house as opposed to going to a bus stop. And he did but I notice he stopped after we became official. I tried talking to him about it but he says they're too expensive since they're a little more expensive than the public buses and he says they don't go to my city since we live in different counties. He also has staff and a driver (It's probably a special driver that brings disabled people to places that a caseworker gave him) but only uses it to go to the gym and other places in his town since he says he can use it only twice a week. I've tried getting him to use this to see me but it rarely ever happened. 

Also, he NEVER brought me to meet his family and I only met his friends a few times. The only time I even saw his family was at his grandmother's wake last year and it grinds my gears. He goes over to his aunt's house for Christmas and a lot of the times for Easter too but he just never offered to invite me or my mother. He always says maybe next year or someday but that day never came. What also bothered me was that he went to cape cod in October for a weekend with family but never bothered to invite me over. Also, he went to North Carolina on a road trip with his family but again, never bothered to invite me and has said maybe next time. Of course, next time never came. 


Another thing that bothers me is  that we still never moved in together and he never even discussed us getting a place together (he still lives with his uncle and aunt. His grandmother also lived with him until her death last year.) Yes, there are ""living apart together"" arrangements for couples, but those couples pretty much always can WALK to each others houses unlike me and my fiancé where our houses are still a 30 minute drive from each other in different counties. He seems to want to live in his current apartment complex forever but I would not want to live there as I'm just not a fan of it. I would like it if we lived apart but our places would be near MY complex! Or we could have our own apartments in a different complex in a different city. 

Also, he never really seemed to want me to come over HIS place! I only came over ONCE, and that was when we were not official yet when we were waiting for his para transit bus to bring us to his workplace Halloween party. I brought this up with him many times but he always seems to have an excuse. 

Some other things that have bothered me were when a few years ago in spring of 2021, he texted me and said that he didn't want me to be friends with one of my very good friends from college anymore because she blocked him and of course I said I was not gonna do that and he got upset. Also, a year later he apparently became friends with my college friend's ex who cheated on him and he told me to tell her not to worry about it. But I knew that I would have been a bad friend for doing that. And he got upset about it too. But he let it go and this kind of thing rarely happened. In fact, it never happened before our engagement which happened around our 4 year anniversary. 

Also, we both used to want children one day but I changed my mind these past couple years when I realized that motherhood just isn't for me. 

He also said a couple times that he wanted to make his ex gf jealous but I think he was probably just joking. Which still rarely happened.But it still bothered me. Also, I didn't notice until we became official that he started talking to me just three months after his breakup with his ex. Which I feel so stupid about. And we became official just another 3 months after that. 

Also, he NEVER used a debit or credit card and only ever used cash to buy stuff. Needless to say he has no bank account. Like we need to have bank accounts to basically survive and thrive these days. If he ever wants to buy something with a card, he always wants to use gift cards rather than a bank account. 

Also, we never really had any sex until a few years into the relationship. Like it wasn't until I got engaged that I gave him a hand job for the first time and it wasn't until the end of 2021 when we had sex. I don't know what happened. And we didn't really have full on intercourse till summer of 2022.  I guess I just didn't initiate anything and waited for him to do so. 

Look, I know these things I listed may sound like yellow or red flags but he also has a chock full of GREEN flags too! He comforted me when I was stressed with stuff such as schoolwork and when my old cat passed away in 2022. He also really adores me and is crazy about me. Also, I am scared, not of being alone but of never finding another man that's as amazing as him. I've read and heard that the dating scene these days is crap. And I had pretty much no luck getting a boyfriend before him. He was pretty much my first boyfriend and I was 22, almost 23 when we became ""official"". Before I met him, I never had a guy I like that would like me back that would also want a relationship. And I didn't even go on my first date till I was 21. I was on the apps such as tinder and plenty of fish in the year or so before meeting my fiancé and it was a crapshoot. Like I went on a couple dates that went nowhere and even dealt with a few men who just wanted casual sex. Also, I do not meet conventional beauty standards and I am one of those ""fat chicks"" which is why I think it took me until my early 20s to have my first boyfriend, date and first kiss too.

I am also worried about how my fiancé will react if I do break up with him. I am worried that he will be really devastated and never recover. And that he will hate me and never forgive me. I am also worried that his friends will hate me too. And I'm also worried that I will ruin his birthday if I do it before a month and a half from now because his birthday is on July 2. Which will be just one month and a few days from now. He is a good man and I don't want him to cry over me on his birthday. Also, several months back, he made me promise to never break up with him and I promised him I would never want to leave and me saying that just makes me feel trapped. Breaking a promise makes someone a horrible person and I don't want to be a horrible monster to someone who genuinely cares for me. 

Also, here's where I'm worried about blindsiding him if I leave tomorrow or Sunday or even on Monday. He does not see a breakup coming and he thinks we will be together forever. I did tell him and give him hints on things that are bothering me but I feel that I was not clear enough or aggressive enough. Ugh. I don't want to blindside him because I've heard that blindsiding someone is very cruel and my fiancé is a very nice man who doesn't deserve to have that happen to him. I would also want us to be on good terms if we do break up and I'm afraid that we won't be and that all hell will break loose. I was always afraid of going through a breakup, especially a really nasty one. What do I do here? How do I move forward? Or maybe I have ""grass is greener"" syndrome and I should stay with him forever and just possibly live with what's bothering me. I mean, he was never abusive or toxic at all. And he was ALWAYS loyal too. Ugh, I just don't know what to do here. And how to not come across as an asshole no matter what I may decide. ",0,1748658836.0,Advice,5,0.5,False

Some other things that have bothered me were when a few years ago in spring of 2021, he texted me and said that he didn't want me to be friends with one of my very good friends from college anymore because she blocked him and of course I said I was not gonna do that and he got upset. Also, a year later he apparently became friends with my college friend's ex who cheated on him and he told me to tell her not to worry about it. But I knew that I would have been a bad friend for doing that. And he got upset about it too. But he let it go and this kind of thing rarely happened. In fact, it never happened before our engagement which happened around our 4 year anniversary. 

Also, we both used to want children one day but I changed my mind these past couple years when I realized that motherhood just isn't for me. 

He also said a couple times that he wanted to make his ex gf jealous but I think he was probably just joking. Which still rarely happened.But it still bothered me. Also, I didn't notice until we became official that he started talking to me just three months after his breakup with his ex. Which I feel so stupid about. And we became official just another 3 months after that. 

Also, he NEVER used a debit or credit card and only ever used cash to buy stuff. Needless to say he has no bank account. Like we need to have bank accounts to basically survive and thrive these days. If he ever wants to buy something with a card, he always wants to use gift cards rather than a bank account. 

Also, we never really had any sex until a few years into the relationship. Like it wasn't until I got engaged that I gave him a hand job for the first time and it wasn't until the end of 2021 when we had sex. I don't know what happened. And we didn't really have full on intercourse till summer of 2022.  I guess I just didn't initiate anything and waited for him to do so. 

Look, I know these things I listed may sound like yellow or red flags but he also has a chock full of GREEN flags too! He comforted me when I was stressed with stuff such as schoolwork and when my old cat passed away in 2022. He also really adores me and is crazy about me. Also, I am scared, not of being alone but of never finding another man that's as amazing as him. I've read and heard that the dating scene these days is crap. And I had pretty much no luck getting a boyfriend before him. He was pretty much my first boyfriend and I was 22, almost 23 when we became ""official"". Before I met him, I never had a guy I like that would like me back that would also want a relationship. And I didn't even go on my first date till I was 21. I was on the apps such as tinder and plenty of fish in the year or so before meeting my fiancé and it was a crapshoot. Like I went on a couple dates that went nowhere and even dealt with a few men who just wanted casual sex. Also, I do not meet conventional beauty standards and I am one of those ""fat chicks"" which is why I think it took me until my early 20s to have my first boyfriend, date and first kiss too.

I am also worried about how my fiancé will react if I do break up with him. I am worried that he will be really devastated and never recover. And that he will hate me and never forgive me. I am also worried that his friends will hate me too. And I'm also worried that I will ruin his birthday if I do it before a month and a half from now because his birthday is on July 2. Which will be just one month and a few days from now. He is a good man and I don't want him to cry over me on his birthday. Also, several months back, he made me promise to never break up with him and I promised him I would never want to leave and me saying that just makes me feel trapped. Breaking a promise makes someone a horrible person and I don't want to be a horrible monster to someone who genuinely cares for me. 

Also, here's where I'm worried about blindsiding him if I leave tomorrow or Sunday or even on Monday. He does not see a breakup coming and he thinks we will be together forever. I did tell him and give him hints on things that are bothering me but I feel that I was not clear enough or aggressive enough. Ugh. I don't want to blindside him because I've heard that blindsiding someone is very cruel and my fiancé is a very nice man who doesn't deserve to have that happen to him. I would also want us to be on good terms if we do break up and I'm afraid that we won't be and that all hell will break loose. I was always afraid of going through a breakup, especially a really nasty one. What do I do here? How do I move forward? Or maybe I have ""grass is greener"" syndrome and I should stay with him forever and just possibly live with what's bothering me. I mean, he was never abusive or toxic at all. And he was ALWAYS loyal too. Ugh, I just don't know what to do here. And how to not come across as an asshole no matter what I may decide. ",2,1748658401.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Same barista almost every day friendly, funny, always remembered my order. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t look forward to seeing her smile in the mornings.

Today, I don’t know what got into me. Maybe it was the weather, maybe I finally got tired of wondering what if  but as she handed me my drink, I just kind of blurted it out. Asked her if she’d be okay sharing her number.

She paused for a second, smiled, and said “one sec.” Then she ran to the back, came back with a card, and handed it to me. I said thank you and walked out feeling like I just unlocked a new level in life.

Later that night, after work, I texted her:
""Hey, it’s [name]. Thanks for giving me your number. How was your day?""

Waited. Nothing.
Slept on it. Still nothing.
Weekend came and went and yeah. Turns out it was a fake number.

I won’t lie that one stung. But hey, no anger here. I’ve worked in retail, I get it. People have their boundaries, and sometimes giving a fake number feels like the safest exit. I tossed the card and made peace with it.

And yes I’m still gonna go back for coffee. It’s a great shop, and life’s too short to let one awkward moment ruin your routine. No hard feelings, no weird vibes. I’ll keep it classy, keep it friendly, and keep sipping my coffee in peace.

Just thought I’d share it’s been a while since I felt brave like that. No regrets. Sometimes just showing up for yourself is the win.

1kzm95y,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kzm95y/been_engaged_to_my_wonderful_fiancé_for_over_85/,Been engaged to my WONDERFUL fiancé for over 8.5 years. But I feel like I’m settling for him. How do I not blindside him if I leave him?,"So this is going to be a long one so I'm sorry about this. 
TL;DR: Been with an amazing guy for over 8.5 years. And we're engaged too. But I'm getting cold feet and thinking about leaving. But I'm also afraid to blindside him and crush his world. And ruin his birthday too since it's just around the corner. 

Here's some background information. I (31F) have been in a relationship with my fiancé (37M) for 8.5 years. We were official since the tail end of November 2016. Anyway, he is a great and wonderful man. He treats me like such a queen here. He is very nice, kind, and such a gentleman. He is also very romantic and such a gentleman. Like he will always walk me to my ride whenever we go out on dates if I have a ride bring me to see him, and he always pulls a chair out for me. Hell, he even did that on our first date, and he even read me a cute poem on that same first date as well which made me swoon. He also always does things like tell me to get home safely, give me thoughtful gifts such as jewelry, a few stuffed animals, flowers, chocolates and even some little souvenirs whenever he went on trips (and I think he even gave me some little crafts he made when he went to this camp for adults too. He even gave me his late grandmother's bracelet and a couple old t-shirts of his) when expected like on birthdays, holidays, etc. Even give me gifts just because. He is also very supportive and physically affectionate too. He is also a very supportive guy. And he tells me he loves me every day. And this is a big one; he was also willing to take it slow and never pushed me for sex. He seems like a dream man and a lot of women would kill to have a man like him. 

Now here is where I'm having doubts and thinking about breaking up. He ALWAYS wants and expects my mother to come pick him up with her car to drive us to dates and even to my house occasionally, if we're not meeting up at the coffee and donut place across from his house or the pizza place or bagel place that's on the same street. Now, he cannot drive due to a disability which I don't have a problem with.  (I also am unable to drive due to me being blind in one eye.) But he never wants to make an effort to use his own transportation. I suggested that he use the public bus but he says his uncle won't let him go on his own and it bothers me so much. He also won't take the public bus to my town because it takes around 3  hours to get from his house to mine which is fair.

However, I know he could use the para transit bus services for disabled people to go around to different places and they'd drop him off and pick him up from his house as opposed to going to a bus stop. And he did but I notice he stopped after we became official. I tried talking to him about it but he says they're too expensive since they're a little more expensive than the public buses and he says they don't go to my city since we live in different counties. He also has staff and a driver (It's probably a special driver that brings disabled people to places that a caseworker gave him) but only uses it to go to the gym and other places in his town since he says he can use it only twice a week. I've tried getting him to use this to see me but it rarely ever happened. 

Also, he NEVER brought me to meet his family and I only met his friends a few times. The only time I even saw his family was at his grandmother's wake last year and it grinds my gears. He goes over to his aunt's house for Christmas and a lot of the times for Easter too but he just never offered to invite me or my mother. He always says maybe next year or someday but that day never came. What also bothered me was that he went to cape cod in October for a weekend with family but never bothered to invite me over. Also, he went to North Carolina on a road trip with his family but again, never bothered to invite me and has said maybe next time. Of course, next time never came. 


Another thing that bothers me is  that we still never moved in together and he never even discussed us getting a place together (he still lives with his uncle and aunt. His grandmother also lived with him until her death last year.) Yes, there are ""living apart together"" arrangements for couples, but those couples pretty much always can WALK to each others houses unlike me and my fiancé where our houses are still a 30 minute drive from each other in different counties. He seems to want to live in his current apartment complex forever but I would not want to live there as I'm just not a fan of it. I would like it if we lived apart but our places would be near MY complex! Or we could have our own apartments in a different complex in a different city. 

Also, he never really seemed to want me to come over HIS place! I only came over ONCE, and that was when we were not official yet when we were waiting for his para transit bus to bring us to his workplace Halloween party. I brought this up with him many times but he always seems to have an excuse.

And we didn't really have full on intercourse till summer of 2022.  I guess I just didn't initiate anything and waited for him to do so. 

Look, I know these things I listed may sound like yellow or red flags but he also has a chock full of GREEN flags too! He comforted me when I was stressed with stuff such as schoolwork and when my old cat passed away in 2022. He also really adores me and is crazy about me.

I was stoked when I heard about the engagement and couldn’t wait to attend. I called my friend to congratulate her (after two years of not speaking due to life and nothing negative), and after an hour of catching up and a few laughs we said goodbye on a happy note.

A week later I get the lecture of a life time from my aunt (mom of cousin) for how ungrateful I am and how it is so inappropriate to make jokes about my family members to other people. I made a joke to my friend about how my cousin always used to have really nice sunglasses as a kid but always used to loose them soon after he bought them, how he is known liking fast vehicles and for having great tastes for scotch and coffee and hopefully she does too. Apparently my cousin was in the back ground and heard part of the call and he told his mom about it.

I was devastated and in tears after the call with my aunt. I wrote my cousin an apology right away and never heard back.

We just got the invite to the wedding and we found out my husband can’t get the weekend off of work (not enough notice since the date wasn’t picked for awhile). I now live out of state and it would cost a small fortune for my family to travel to the wedding (if my husband were to call into work). I have a 3y and 1y old and don’t want to fly with both alone. I don’t believe I would have the best time visiting that side of the family either since my parents are now divorced and my sister isn’t involved with that side of the family anymore, plus that side of the family has never made a trip out to meet my kids, and they misspelled my husband’s name on the invite so it doesn’t seem like they really care about us. But my aunt is acting like it is the end of the world if we don’t come and talking very negatively about us to everyone because of it.

(Also, no congratulations/gift was sent from the friend or cousin when I got married or when we had the kids)",1,1748658231.0,AITAH,3,0.6,False

i don’t drive so this place is really easy for me in terms of transport as it is a 10 minute walk from my house. the only issue is that the management is absolutely HORRIBLE and i’ve had way too many issues. there’s a lot of aspects about the place that just really stresses me out. mind you this specific mcdonalds opened just over a year ago. i won’t go into the details, but i’ve been considering relocating for a very long time

in my time working there, i’ve learnt how to make coffees and would really like to work at a cafe. there is a new cafe just next to the mcdonalds that opened maybe a month ago, and i’m very interested in applying. i asked if they were hiring and they said to just hand in my resume

i think this job would be a lot calmer and nicer for me than my current however my only problem is:
it’s independently owned
unlike mcdonalds which is owned by a large company, if something bad were to happen to me in this cafe i wouldn’t have any security like i would at mcdonalds which kind of worries me

also, when i asked the cafe if they were hiring, i forgot to ask what the pay is so i also have no idea when would be the right time to ask 😭 should i give my resume then ask or ask and then give my resume?? i overthink a lot 💔
any advice is really appreciated!

So, when I’m out with my friends, he says I don’t fall asleep when I’m with them. What do I say? What do I do? I don’t understand why he gets upset that I fall asleep early but never want to do anything besides lay on the couch and watch tv. When I stay awake late, he falls asleep.

My wife and I recently became parents, and like many of you, we dove headfirst into the world of baby products. In the process, we bought three strollers (yes, three!) and over ten baby bottles—though my wife insists it was definitely more than ten.

We quickly realized how hard it was to find product recommendations we could actually trust. So much of what’s out there is driven by affiliate links and sponsored content, and it’s rarely tailored to what your family actually needs.

That’s why we built bbsaver.com.

bbsaver is not trying to be the ultimate baby product site. It’s a simple, fair, and honest tool to help new parents compare baby gear based on their unique situation—not what’s trending or what earns a commission.

There are no ads, no affiliate links, and no sponsored posts. Just straight-up, personalized comparisons based on what’s important to your family.

We’d love for you to check it out and let us know what you think. And as two coders who’ve gone through the parenting fire, we’re always looking for ways to help other new parents. If you have ideas, problems tech could solve, or feedback of any kind—we’re all ears.

Wishing you calm naps and strong coffee",0,1748658049.0,pregnant,1,0.33,False
