Here's a summary of what's happened so far ( I have known him now for 2 weeks) 

Short summary: 
We worked on a project together and ended up chatting a lot. When we parted ways, he asked for my socials, messaged me the next day and continued asking questions about me, like what I teach, hobbies etc.
  - When we hugged goodbye the first time, he said it was really nice meeting me.  
   - He asked if I’d stop by when he and his colleagues will be at some event and I did. I even gave him a little fidget and he was very happy with it and I got it from that event. 
   - affer the event in the evening,  he texted me like, that I stayed quite long at the event and srill he didn't manage to say good bye and that he would love to talk more, but it was so busy and later messaged me about small things we’d talked about, like my hobbies.  
   - the next day, suddenly he was coming to campus - ask me if I will be there around lunch (apparently he was gonna study on campus with friends) he told me that he was thinking that I might be on campus as well.  But before I can reply he said that I probably will have a lunchpartner (without waiting for my answer). So I suggested to met for a short coffee break later, where we talked casually (only 15 mins, since I got a meeting). He messaged afterward to ask if I still needed earphones (to borrow foe the meeting) I’d mentioned.  
   - During the meeting, I noticed subtle body language like quick glances at my lips and waist, and he made small talk about wanting to hang out ""next time."" Also he had good eye contact with me. 
- also today he asked me what my weekend plans are. 
 I do feel a connection with him that I haven’t felt with others. He seems to enjoy spending time with me and initiates conversations, but I’m unsure if he’s just being polite and friendly or if he’s actually interested in me.

1heh7zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1heh7zj/ive_lost_a_relationship_with_an_ex_sister_in_law/,I’ve lost a relationship with an ex sister in law. ,"I’m trying to figure out if this is salvageable or if I just need to move on. 
My ex and I broke up in 2012.  We were together for almost 9 years.  From the beginning, his sister and I hit it off and we were fast friends. We lived in different cities during the entire duration of the relationship, but kept in touch and saw each other several times a year. We shared many close times with one another, from vacations to holidays. While I didn’t consider her my sister, I always thought of her as a close friend.  
My ex and I broke up in 2012. It was messy.  He had been cheating on me for months with a mutual friend, and left me to be in that relationship. While the first several months, things seemed to carry on as usual, something changed around Christmas 2012. Two days before Christmas, my ex and the new boyfriend got in a fight. They both called me several times—over the course of a day, to try to get details of the break up timeline.  I let it all go to voicemail, but after an evening out, I listened to the messages. I called my ex the next day on Christmas Eve and yelled at him to stay out of my life and away from me, this pettiness was not welcome. I think I caught him when he was with family, and his retelling of the story was not kind on my behalf.  I know my ex SIL was there. Things seemed to change after that. 
We did talk a couple of months later, but I could tell there was something different. We kept in touch casually through 2013 and she finally quit texting back.  I was crushed at the time, but honestly didn’t have a good answer given that we were still speaking through that year.  
We were friends on Facebook, and in 2017, I reached out to her and she was friendly and receptive.  She told me she felt like it had been enough time.  She was nervous her family would find out we were talking.  I thought that was an odd thing to say, given that she was a woman in her 40s. I responded with I didn’t talk to anyone about else, and that it would stay between us. We had a phone call and it was just like old times. She ended the call with “l love you” We had reconnected and it felt wonderful.  
After a few calls over the next several months, we stopped communicating again.  I just let it go. 
We never picked back up communication or texting. Outside of a rare Facebook like, we haven’t had any communication for years, until…
My exes now husband reached out to me in May. He said my ex was a serial cheater and wanted some advice.  He asked me to text my ex SIL and validate what we had both went through. She told me that I would always have a special place in her heart.  She also said that her now almost grown sons still talk about me, and thought I was very nice.  She didn’t share any utter updates though, or pictures.  Thrilled that she had responded, I gave her a brief update on my life with pictures of my 2 year old. We didn’t talk any more after a couple of exchanges. 
I feel like she wants to move on. I’m not sure if I should try to unthaw this again, or if it’s done.  It’s just weird how close we were, can we not have a friendship that exists occasionally over text and social media?  We live on two separate coasts, so there’s no option to ask if she is free for coffee and go from there.

1heh2mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1heh2mx/my_inlaws_live_in_my_back_yard/,My in-laws live in my back yard.,"Like the title says my in-laws live in my back yard (in an RV)

Buckle up it's a long one. 

In 2021 a forest fire tore through British Columbia and unfortunately my in-laws lost their home (A very complicated rental situation)
In the two weeks leading up to the fire my father-in-law stayed at the house while my mother-in-law came to our place, she stayed in a camper in the back as our house is very small. My father-in-law for 2 weeks could have completely emptied all of their possessions from the house but did not, they lost everything apart from a few things that my mother-in-law brought with her when she came, amongst those things was four cats and a dog. After the fire my in-laws had their sights set on buying an RV to live in and in the end despite my advice to them to buy a much cheaper fifth wheel they ended up using a loan to buy a summer season RV for well above it's market value, this RV has numerous issues but I won't get into that here. The initial deal was they would have one calendar year to live at our place while looking for a permanent residence, that didn't happen so we extended that agreement a year and that brings us to now nearly 4 years later. I like my in-laws but I really want my life back, I built a shelter for their RV with the expectation of being able to use it in a year to keep our valuables under, now I'm going to list all my problems with this situation. 
My in-laws are messy, I'm talking garbage on the ground bags and bags and bags of empties, generally just trailer trash poverty looking dumpiness.
They don't contribute apart from paying for their power consumption, I've made repeated requests for help to do yard work on the two and a half acres that we own and very rarely receive it, these things can be as simple as weed whacking around their stuff in the backyard, typically this goes as far as me setting everything up for them and then eventually me doing it myself, I've also asked in the past for my mother-in-law to help us with housework even offering to pay her an hourly wage but that didn't happen.

They fight constantly, I don't like going into my shop which is in the backyard because every time I go into my shop I have to listen to those two screaming at each other (so do the neighbors), the dog barks they fight, this particularly has been taking a toll on my relationship with my wife. 

Some people are going to rag on me for this but I don't like cats in fact that despise them, for one I'm extremely allergic to cats but mainly it's because they s*** in my garden, they s*** in my carport, they s*** under my deck, they piss on my stuff! They've also pissed and s*** tons underneath the in-laws RV but they do not seem to care, every single large tree in my yard has dry sandy soil underneath of it full of cat s***. 

They won't keep their dog tied up on the dog run that I built, their dog is a nice dog but he is not safe with other dogs, I've heard multiple times ""oh he just wants to play"" no he's dangerous and we've had three incidents that I was able to intervene in and prevent very serious problems from rising, in addition to this he also s**** everywhere and they never pick it up unless I show them exactly where it is, I am constantly stepping in s*** of all kinds.

They have so much stuff, neither of them ride bicycles but they've got two, they don't canoe but they've got a canoe, they have three vehicles, four including the motorhome (now I'm going to confess that I have over 10 vehicles myself but it's my yard) this summer when they were gone I went into the backyard and pulled old carpeting out of the mud that they had just left on the ground, I found a shirt in the mud, disposable coffee cups, receipts, plastic bags, styrofoam, cardboard, we have recycling pickup and I go to the dump almost every weekend there's no reason to have trash. 

Now I'm going to list what they do to help, they give us $600 a month for the power bill and with our equal payment plan through our Hydro company we pay just over $300 a month for electricity, now once a year the whole plan equalizes and I have to make a huge payment so essentially I hang on to whatever doesn't get used for the equal payment plan on a monthly basis and then at the end of the year I use the remainder to pay the remaining balance, the main reason for this is because they live in an RV with absolutely no insulation and use small electric space heaters to heat it, prior to them moving in my total energy consumption per month was about $109 we're now typically running between $350 and $800 per month obviously the winter months being a much higher cost. 

Last year I asked if we could increase the rent a little bit and I was told that they couldn't afford it so I did not pursue it beyond that point, about a week and a half later they got an above ground swimming pool......

 I want to make it absolutely clear to everybody that reads this that I don't hate my in-laws I just don't want to live with them, I'm in my late 30s and my wife and I bought this place and got to enjoy it to ourselves for 2 years before they moved in, I don't want them to be homeless but at the end of the day it's not me making these calls there are now and were before options available to both of them, the main issue with these options are my mother-in-law doesn't like them, mainly that option is moving in with her father who needs in home care and could benefit from her being there. Additionally there are things they could change in their lives but it's not my job to guide them and I'm frankly tired of being a parent to people that are 30 and 40 years older than me, I would really really like to have my more or less peaceful life with my wife back. 

So I'm going to tell them in the new year they have 8 months to find a place but regardless at the end of that they have to go. So AITA? ",2,1734223737.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

After I had my baby my A1C has been 5.8, and my lab results came back that we should monitor my kidneys! I was thinking heavily about doing a weight loss medication, but started to get concerned when I was reading about all the side effects. I did lots of research to find out the good the bad the ugly and YouTube recommended a video for me about 

Berberine by Dr. Kate Lyzenga-Dean. I watched her videos about it and decided to give it a try! she had a link in her bio to the Berberine she recommends:
Brand - Metagenics 
Bottle Title: practitioner recommended, scientifically designed, crafted with plant-based ingredients, cardio, metabolic, berberine GT

I did extensive research on Reddit and YouTube about dosage (I met with my nurse practitioner here in Anchorage, Alaska, and asked about it, she referred me to the natural clinic here in Anchorage, but unfortunately, they have the first visit as you have to pay no insurance, I am a single mom who is no longer breast-feeding, so I decided I’m going to do this not under the care of a health provider. I will go into my nurse practitioners office and do labs once a month.)

I will update this post once a month just to share my experience! 

I am going to start off by taking 500mg for ONE month (I heard many stories about bloating, diarrhea, and cystic acne!) 

Then month 2 I will try 1000mg.

They are just really rude, selfish, self-righteous, and the most unaware and uncaring people I've ever met. His parents are also racist and his mother is genuinely the worst, most evil woman I've ever met. 

We've been dating for almost 3 years now and he only just told his parents about me about a year ago because his parents, especially his mom was very racist towards my culture and hateful of me. She hated my culture, the fact that he was spending time with me lots, etc. He finally told them and I went over to their home once, and his dad was fine but his mom was the worst. The entire time she wouldn't talk to me and kept talking to my boyfriend only in another language even though she knows English. She also made some comments about my culture which came off racist and just mocking of my culture / putting it down. I took flowers and baked a cake specially for meeting them for the first time and I'm a good baker and it was a really good cake liked by others, but his parents didn't even try it until my boyfriend cut it. Once he did, the dad did complement it, but his mom said nothing. After my boyfriend asked her how it was, saying how it was so nice and it looked so good, was when she finally said something, however she said it was just ""ok"". Then at the end as we were leaving, she gave the whole cake back to us which I gave to them as a gift even though they knew we weren't going to be home for another 6 hours so it would've gone bad. Then, towards the end, as we were leaving and running late to something, his mother hugged him and just started crying saying how she misses him so much and that they've don't see each other enough (we live like 2 hrs away from them and he sees them once every month or 2 but not much because of university). I found this really weird cuz who just cries like that in front of someone new for this, especially when they live like not even 2 hrs away from him. 

Even afterwards, she continued making remarks about me and trying to get my bf to break up with me and saying that he can score someone prettier, taller (I'm 5'4 so not even that short), and someone whose mother hasn't died of cancer - yeah she somehow made that a bad thing too. Instead of sympathizing with the girl who lost her mother at 17 due to cancer, she instead made it a bad thing, saying to him how she shouldn't be with me and shouldn't marry me because my mom passed away from cancer and that in the future I'll die and leave him and our kids alone, making him sad (we're 21 rn so we're not even at the age of being married). The cancer my mom had wasn't even genetic, and I get tested often still and have been tested negative for the gene too, not that it matters. Everytime he goes back home, she says something about me and tries to get him to break up with me or just tries to guilt him. She says that I'm the reason she doesn't see her son often, being totally unaware that he literally even left the city to go to another university to avoid her because she was so toxic to him growing up. 

Despite all this, I've still given his parents many chances and even invited them to my home, but his mom is still the same in the way she talks about me to my boyfriend. His sister and brother in law are accepting of me (both in their mid 30s), but they're just so weird and as if they never learned how to behave as decent human beings. One time my boyfriend was hospitalized so they came to visit him and I offered them my apartment to stay the weekend over, but they were so rude and just overall had guests making a mess and causing me an inconvenience. They also brough food and snacks just for my boyfriend and absolutely nothing for me when they got to the hospital even though I had been there all day next to him and they knew. They even brought their kitten to my home, leaving me with no choice in the matter, and because of that I couldn't leave my own dog at home while visiting my bf at the hospital, and having to pay for doggy daycare. Me and his sister and BIL had also made plans to go eat dinner at this one restaurant after leaving the hospital, otw to my home, but as I drove their in my car, I ask them where they are and they messaged me saying they had already bought food and eaten but if I want them to join me still at the restaurant we were all supposed to go to, then they can. Like wtf???? I was so hurt by this and didn't want their pity so I just went home and went to bed without having eaten. While I got ready for bed, they sat their and ate their takeout food at my dining table, without asking or offering me any, despite having known I hadn't had lunch nor dinner as I was at the hospital all day with my bf. And to make things worse, they knew I'm a vegetarian and I don't bring meat into my home because it goes against my values, and they still bought and ate meat in my home, without even asking me. Next day when we all went to the hospital and were leaving at night, we (the 3 of us) made plans to go eat dinner together and even though I didn't want to and was still very hurt, I gave them a second chance. At the restaurant, the waiter asked us if it'd be one bill and they both say no and then I pay separately for my less than $20 meal. They are 15 years older than me and both work full time jobs while I'm a student, who literally gave them a place to sleep in for 2 nights and saved them so much money that they would've spent on a hotel because my boyfriend's place isn't big enough and he has roommates, yet they still didn't pay for a single meal for me nor buy me food. Next day they went and ate food outside but I had no desire to go with them so I stayed home and then we all met at the hospital. They then brought lunch just for my boyfriend, and nothing for me, while I stayed home and literally cleaned their mess they left in my home. 

I hated them so much after this weekend, especially because I let them into my home only after the 2 times we'd met, and they disrespected me in my home. Despite all this, I still gave them more chances because I wanted to be okay with them for my boyfriend's sake. But time after time they hurt me and just make me wanna never talk to them. 

My boyfriend got hospitalized again and I've been with him for days taking care of him and even let his family know so they could come see him, but they've been the most unappreciative, rude, selfish, unaware, and uncaring people I've ever met. I got myself a hotel and was going to come in today around noon and told my bf and his sister, but a while later, when his parents came to the hospital, the 4 of them went to go eat lunch without having asked me at all to join them. I came to the hospital as they were eating lunch and just sat with my bf in his room while I had my coffee and pastry I had just bought. There are only 2 visitors allowed in his room so when his parents came in, me and his sister and BIL left the room and went to the waiting area. Then his dad came out to go buy snacks and protein shakes for my bf, and he left with the sister and BIL without telling me anything, not until I called and asked as they were walking away what they were doing. Then, the 3 of them come back and walk right past me while I was there studying for my exam, and didn't even care to say hi or tell me they were all going into my boyfriend's room. Only 2 visitors are allowed and I thought we were sticking to that because that's why I had originally left, but then the 4 of them went into his room and they were all there for like 40 mins, while I was just sitting there alone outside when they hadn't even thought to tell me that they came back from buying snacks for my bf (they didn't bring anything back for me FYI). I felt so alone and sad because I've been the one with my bf for the last week and even drove him 2 hours away to a better hospital, all while they weren't here. I did all that and forget being unappreciative, but they literally just left me outside. I just sat there and cried in the waiting room. What kind of people do that? They are all 15-40 years older than me yet they treat me like this. I tried messaging my boyfriend asking if they were all in the room but his phone was away and he didn't see my messages. I then eventually texted his sister and she told me after like 40 mins, that they were in the room. Yet no one still came and invited me in, even though I've been the one here with him for a week, skipping my exams, driving him here, all while I'm also stressed and worried for my exams. 

I hate them all with a burning passion and never want anything to do with them for the rest of my life. I'm done with them. I love my boyfriend so much and gave them so many chances, but they haven't changed. I am now done with them and just don't want anything to do with them nor see them again after how they've treated me time after time. AITA for feeling this way? AITA for telling my bf I never want to see them and that I'm fine with him having a relationship with them, but I don't want any part of it nor see them again and that he can see them as much as he wants, just not with me there?

I’m married to a great guy for 18 years and this past year met a guy at work 25 years younger than me and we became friends.  He became my favorite person and I went through that whole thing, we went no contact for a while and now he is a friend without being a favorite person.  Also we have always been platonic.

Here is where I am all messed up.  I was with the guy friend yesterday for coffee, my husband had the day off and took the car to go somewhere (we only have one car) I was going to walk home but it was really cold so my husband brought me the keys at the coffee shop.  I should mention that my husband and this friend of mine are not friendly, like my husband is a social guy and has tried to be friendly with the friend but the friend is not the best with social interactions so things have been a little awkward.

Anyways, the friend noticed my husband first and asked if it was him and I said yes but I was rather shocked and kind of freaked out because things haven’t been smooth between them.  After my husband left the friend told me he thought I had set the whole thing  up and I was like WTF?!  Like I didn’t react in the moment to that but since yesterday the more I think about this, the more upset I am, like I have tried to be a really good friend to him and he thinks I would set him up?

1hegvpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hegvpy/wibtah_if_i_distanced_myself_and_cut_some_family/,WIBTAH if I distanced myself and cut some family members off?,"I (M23) lost my father 8 years ago. Since then, as the only man in the family, I’ve taken on the responsibility of managing our property while working a part-time job and pursuing my bachelor’s degree. On top of that, I’ve built a new house in our home country—not fancy, but necessary since the current one is old and in poor condition. Although my mom and sisters help me when I need it, I handle most of it on my own.

The issue lies with my grandfather’s brothers and their families (my father’s cousins). My parents immigrated away from our home country, so here we live close by car, but when we visit our home country, our properties are right next to each other, close enough to walk.

It seems like they’re always hoping for my failure, because after my father passed, they repeatedly asked things like, *“Are you going to sell the property?”* or *“Can you manage it on your own?”* During my apprenticeship, they doubted me, and now that I’m pursuing my degree, it’s the same negativity. They make comments like, *“Why are you even doing this?”*

No matter how much effort I put in, they always talk behind my back. Meanwhile, their own children—who are my age—rarely show up at family gatherings like funerals, weddings, or other important events. Yet, their parents excuse this by saying their kids are *“still young,”* while holding me to an unfairly high standard.

There was also an incident involving our property in our home country. One of my dad’s cousins tried to claim part of it, insisting it was his—even though it wasn’t. Many family members sided with him and told us to *“not make a fuss”* over something *“so small,”* saying we were the ones causing unnecessary problems. Instead of supporting us or staying neutral, they undermined us.

To make matters worse, whenever we’re in our home country, these same relatives frequently come over to our house—spending mornings drinking coffee with us and staying late into the evening. However, they rarely invite me, my mom, or my sisters to their gatherings, like when they go grilling or on outings.

In our culture, arranged marriages are still common, though finding someone on your own is also widely accepted. I’ve heard from more distantly related family members that there have been people who showed interest in me. However, after asking around and speaking to my father’s side of the family, these people often take a step back, saying things like, *“We’re not sure if a meeting between him and our daughter is a good idea after what we’ve heard. He seems nice, but other aspects aren’t great.”*

I don’t even want to get married right now, but it still hurts to know that they’re badmouthing me. In my culture, the father’s side of the family is considered very close, and I’ve never done anything to them. I understand that some jealousy or gossip is inevitable, but this feels excessive.

Idk (NO CENSORING),"I woke up on Friday feeling absolutely fine but gradually throughout the day I started feeling worse. I had on and off stomach aches and was insanely tired so I slept and woke up feeling weak (I hadn’t eaten anything all day because I was scared it was going to happen) so I had a cheese toastie and some chocolate and was ok. I went to sleep totally fine that night with some stomach discomfort but not unbearable. 
Yesterday, Saturday I woke up feeling kind of bad but I still ate breakfast and was ok. I checked my temperature and saw it was 37.8 degrees Celsius (pretty sure that’s a low grade fever) and told my mum but she said it’s probably because of the heat (I’m in Australia and it’s summer so it’s been insanely hot recently) my family then went to our family friends house for dinner where I had nibbles but I didn’t have the actual dinner. In the car home I got on and off stomach aches but then was fine for the rest of the night. 
I have had really bad back pains and cramps in my lower stomach but my periods due in 2 days so I’m assuming that has some play into why I feel like this. 
However, I checked my temperature just then and it was 37.5 degrees Celsius which made me kind of freak out? 
I’m currently having a coffee and had some gummies. 
I feel like I might have a mild stomach bug or maybe food poisoning which isn’t great but it is what it is! I know there’s a chance I could throw up which is absolutely terrifying to me but I know that if it happened I’ll be ok.  
Side note: the last time I threw up was on the 18th of December last year and it’s getting closer to that date. So I feel it might also have something to do with that as well.

1hegurg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hegurg/hes_affectionate_in_person_but_never_gives_me_any/,He's affectionate in person but never gives me any compliment nor flirts with me,"I (35F) have been seeing this guy (38M) for the past few weeks. We've been on 5 dates and have a 6th planed tomorrow. 

When we see each other in person, he's very affectionate towards me. He kisses me, holds my hand as we walk, engages in the conversation, he's listening and asks me questions. We have been intimate already and spent hours later just kissing in bed and looking each other in the eye, but we also go out to brunch, he stayed to watch a movie the other day, ... 

The problem is... he gives me nothing verbally. In the early, early stages, he would sometimes tell me he was eager to see me, but it stopped pretty quickly. I've given him compliments to which he only once or twice said ""you're cute too"" or ""you're hot too"" but generally ignores it. Same when I tell him I'm glad to see him upon meeting him, or that I like spending time with him - he ignores or deflects. 

He texts me everyday, and if I text first he always replies quickly, but the conversation is friendly, almost platonic. I feel like there's been a shift. I told him about it, asking him if it was a good idea to keep seeing each other and that if he had lost interest, he could just tell me, it would be absolutely fine, I just needed to know to proceed accordingly (we're both only dating one person at a time). He told me he appreciated my directness and that he didn't have the feeling anything had changed, he was still interested in getting to know me. He told me he didn't know what kind of relationship we were moving towards to but we could talk about it and to let him know if there was ever anything on my mind. I said alright, and that I would trust him on his word then. 

We saw each other and only at the very end of the date did he say ""me too"" when I told him I liked seeing him that night. For the first time ever he made a comment after sex - he said ""this was good. This was very nice."" 

He was always proactive in planning our dates but this time, I had to ask him when we'd see each other again and the plans kind of hang up in the air. He texted me when he got home as he said he would, told me he had ""a very nice evening"" and that was it. We texted a bit the next day, and tonight he didn't text me all day but at around 5pm I asked him if tomorrow was still on since we didn't really make concrete plans. He said he thought I had a birthday party to go to, but suggested an afternoon coffee. He suggested we'd see each other for an hour, I said that would be pretty short, then he said we could meet an hour earlier. I said that I didn't want him to have to rush his day so maybe we could just reschedule, to which he said he could definitely make it work for an hour earlier. So, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow. 

I'm so confused. When I sent him the text about feeling like he was disinterested, he answered me with what seemed to be genuine apologies for making me feel this way, assuring me sex was not the only thing he was chasing after. When we see each other he acts very lovingly with me, whether in public or at home. But he doesn't express any interest in deepening the emotional connection and doesn't pick up my attempts to do so. It feels like it's even progressing backwards, emotionally speaking, while the physical affection only seems to amp up, and I'm not just talking about sex but even holding me watching a movie, kissing me in front of everyone as we meet at the subway...

Give it to me straight. Am I being played, and should I understand he only wants this to be casual? 

I'm going to talk to him about this tomorrow anyways, but this is messing with my head, and I don't trust myself when I'm near him. I've always been very lucky in relationships, and I have never had to second guess myself or a man's attention that much before. I need help to see things straight.

But then I notice two students in front of me, sitting together by the window, working on something at the same laptop that makes them stop and laugh, stop and laugh. He wears sweatpants, a bright orange t-shirt, a gold chain. She wears a black halter top, gray cotton tights, large hoop earrings. He is young, a few days unshaven, his hair short but growing out in all directions, bright needles that appear above an evergreen in springtime. Her hair is long, flowing, like a moving body of water that spills over its banks, down her back. The outside air has that cold humid quality that seems all the time on the verge of snow – when I squint, I  see wavy lines from ambiguous sources of heat. The halter top is half on its way to being a sports bra, or a sports bra deciding today, dirty laundry overflowing, it will serve as a halter top. She leans into him with unmistakable desire, though what her body craves might be at odds with what her mind believes, future employers will prefer. He stays focused on the laptop like it has all the answers, his eyes not shifting to her breasts right there next to him, as though to do so might be all fate requires to intervene. They are university students in the middle of final exams, agreeing to take a break together, think of something else besides the next round of tests, and so I guess the coffee place is a kind of spa, the laptop a way to draw bodies near to each other. He wears untied white sneakers, and she’s in black boots unzipped, and I can see a wrinkle in his t-shirt twitching rhythmically, like one of his legs is bouncing in place, listening to an unconscious music track. His sex organ is doubtless feeling that rhythm, petitioning the judge for an existential recess from this multi-year program of success his student-body is engaged in. Then I see her leg is bouncing in place, the right one which he can’t really see, like she’s secretly dancing to the same disco song in his mind. Her sex is feeling that rhythm, too, unsure what to do next, and the two of them self-stimulate like that while they trade remarks about website design, the weather next week. I realize I’m really the only one who can see this play out, knows what it means – a spontaneous sex show – and here I am taking notes about it to share with the world. Obviously not penetrative, not even clothes off, save for the sports bra v. halter top situation, when the temperature is, like, 25F outside. I mean, you be you, but when you lean in together – you with your gold braided chain, knowing what that does to the world, to her – then your legs begin to shake like that, and you’ll say it’s coffee, anxiety – but when that song begins to play through your bodies, it means your bodies hope to press together. If we found social acceptance in people embracing in public, minutes at a time – not sexually so, just intimate, close – I think they would have wanted to. Time to hug? the one would ask the other, after they were finished with the laptop – the other would nod – then the two would hug each other from their chairs, scoot closer after a quick minute, close enough to curl their legs around each other. They press their ears together, listen to the silence like a hymn, kiss the air, then each other, then her hand is on his bare back beneath his shirt – and he is slipping his fingertips inside the waistband of her tights. Perhaps it goes farther than that, but when I look up, I see they are both relaxed in their chairs, staring out the window like they’re thinking about what’s next on the schedule. No idea whether it means what’s for lunch, how’s next week or some date decades from now, in the sweet spot of retirement, sunning on the beach, one coast or the other.",1,1734222792.0,MetaphysicalWeather,0,1.0,False

1hegodz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1hegodz/get_tachycardia_as_heart_slows/,Get tachycardia as heart slows,"Hello All,

Was hoping for some insight.

Have recently started getting brief spells of tachycardia during the immediate cool down after physical activity. For example if I briefly run, then once I stop running, a minute or so later as my heart slows and returns back to normal it races again, and usually for around 10-20 seconds.

This can be quite intense, and even after walking it occurs. So definitely limiting and unnerving. I can usually stop it by forcing a yawn - it does seem sometimes it is related to how I am breathing before it starts. 

I saw my doctor and she has suggested 3 day holter and in the meantime to take flecainide. This has worked in terms of suppressing it but I don’t like the idea of being on this long term.

I am 46m with history of AF. Exercise a lot, 5-6 times a week so reasonably fit. Take medication for blood pressure and cholesterol (runs in family). When this started I was in the middle of a dry spell in terms of booze and hadn’t drunk anything for a month, so wasn’t like that or coffee caused the stimulation.

Any ideas or thoughts on this eg cause for concern, why it has started, ideas on treatment etc would be good.",1,1734222497.0,askCardiology,0,1.0,False

I cannot express the sheer number of times that I’ve been left out of the friend group at one point or another. I can remember the times I’ve been included, but it happens so infrequently by comparison. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve mentioned my concerns to one of my friends and she assured me that I’m valued and important but… actions speak louder than words, right? If I was a valuable member of the friend group, if they wanted to hang out with me, they would. They’d invite me. They’d include me.

 
I’ve basically decided that I don’t want to try anymore. And I HATE that. I don’t want to keep asking where they are so I can find them and join them. I don’t want to respond to conversations via text, only so that my text goes un-responded to. The friend who I spoke to about this already – she made a comment the other day about how she can’t believe we hadn’t discussed a recent event together yet. And I wanted to turn around and point out that she never tries to hang out with me anymore. She’s actively (consciously or subconsciously) choosing to sit beside another one of our friends, to talk to him (and no, it’s not romantic in any way). I’m literally always available for my friends, yet never included. How many times have I sat in the library and seen my friends walk together to a coffee shop, and not even think about asking me? How many times have I sat at my computer while they’re all laughing together?

 
And sure – maybe they don’t want to bother me. Maybe they think I need the time to study, or maybe they are trying to be considerate. But why not even ask? Why not invite? Why not text, knowing that I’ll either have my phone on do not disturb OR I’ll see the text and let them know yes/no?

 
And God, for the life of me – how is EVERYONE texting each other SO much?? I have literally fewer than 10 people that I text semi-regularly. And rarely do I have unread text messages. It’s only in group chats that I get more than 10+ unread messages. How are people texting like 5 people at once at any given moment in time? And I am RARELY a recipient? Am I not good at texting? Am I selfish? What the hell is wrong with me that I am not someone my friends want to be with? What is wrong with me that I am not someone they want to text? That they’d actively seek out? 
 

I’m also always the forgotten friend. I’ve gotten apologies before – “sorry I forgot you were coming to this lecture,” or “sorry I meant to save you a seat but *excuse* please forgive me!” I’m the person who was NOT mentioned in the big group chat on my birthday, yet everyone else is. I’m the person who is never remembered.

 
I am a Christian, so I wonder if that’s part of God’s plan for me – that I’m supposed to learn something about myself, about Him, about life and the meaning of friendships. And sure, my artistic/creative brain, the part of me that reads and writes, can think of a million meaningful reasons that I’ve been put in these situations. But I’m so freaking tired of feeling like the odd one out, of being a poorly valued friend. And I cannot freaking understand if this is reality or if I’m being unrealistic, if my perception is completely wrong and skewed.",1,1734222317.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

for context, my dad has always been 1.) very obsessive about his health diet, and 2.) convinced that mental health issues aren't real.

He's always been thin, very into eating healthy, exercise, fasting, and dieting, but I wouldn't say he's taken it excessively far - like, sometimes it was worrying, but he'd go back to normal eating relatively quickly or at least wouldn't be, i don't know, going into what I'd consider ""immediately dangerous"" territory with it. However, he recently came home from a long(ish) business trip, and one of the first things he mentioned to me was that he was on ozempic (???) to help him stop drinking (I guess that's fine) but he mostly just talked about how he lost 15 pounds in what was, like, a little under a month, and revealed to me that he's been eating <300 calories a day in a diet that consists of basically just coffee in the morning, a can of soda, and chocolate sweetened with some type of ""healthy"" sweetener to help ""activate the ozempic more"" and how he spent the first week of it basically just sleeping in bed with zero energy and how he hasnt even really. shit. in like a couple weeks cause hes not eating anything his body doesnt ""dissolve"" and when i asked how he was getting his micro-nutrients, like vitamins and stuff, he said that's ""already in his fat"" and its just a very scary sudden extreme from him that came out of left field and i'm not sure how long he intends to keep this up but its obviously unsustainable and im very worried

i dont know his exact build, but im like \~5'6 and \~125lbs and hes built similar to me (but hes a pant/belt size down from me, even before this) like im already thin. hes already thin. when i lost \~5lbs cause of a medication i was put on, it was a big deal cause of how light i already am, so 15 in a couple weeks or so is scary

the main thing making it hard to bring up is that he doesnt really believe in mental health issues. some of the biggest disagreements we've gotten into have been over him not taking my mental health issues seriously/disagreeing with me that i need therapy/medication, and i dont know how to put it in a way that hes not gonna be able to misconstrue as leftwing sensitive snowflake bullshit and/or obviously not ""real"" health science

and i mean honestly if it goes on for more than a week im just gonna bring it up tactlessly i guess because i dont want him to, uh, kill himself, frankly, but im wondering if anyone has advice as to how to do it in a way he wont dismiss",1,1734222121.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

I'm a local artist on the Central Coast and I do kids and youth summer workshops at the Gosford Regional Gallery/FunHaus in Gosford. My art medium is Japanese terrariums.

I was wondering if any local businesses regularly go through Moccona style coffee jars or the Mayvers XL jars. I would love to collect them. The youth workshops are run at a very low cost so that any family can use the Creative Kids voucher to send their child, so I use these style jars to keep the cost low. 

I used to get them through Lifeline but they have stopped collecting them unfortunately. Please reply or DM if you could help. You can check out the workshops on the social links in my profile or the Regional Art Gallery's website/instagram if you want to know more.

To be honest Paris was pretty boring as as solo traveler. I quickly realized that being alone in a place like that wasn't for me, so in my last 2 days of being there I matched with a guy on hinge for a drink. His name was Pierre. 

Pierre was a bit above average height with brown hair, a beautiful smile, and an adorable French accent. We had some fun flirting over the app and I was looking forward to just being able to socialize with someone again - even if it would just be a drink or two. 

I met him at a cafe and jesus christ he is a handsome man. He was masculine yet completely adorable and we really clicked. I learned all about his life and what was supposed to be a coffee or two ended up as a full day together touring the Louvre, then dinner, and then us spending the night. We had sex but it didn't feel like a hookup at all, and almost felt like this was becoming something real at an alarming rate. 

In the morning I expected to leave but he asked if I wanted to get breakfast and offered to show me more of the City. I eagerly accepted and the entire day we walked around Paris acting as if we were boyfriends. We walked all of Paris while holding hands and took pictures together. Later in the evening we viewed the skyline together from the Eiffel Tower and he confessed that the past day has been the best date he had ever been on, and I knew it was the same for myself as well - but  I also had tears in my eyes because I knew that the next day I was supposed to fly back to New York and that I would have to say goodbye.

I packed my things at my AirBnB to spend my last night with him and I couldn't help but write him a letter confessing that I loved my time with him, and that I wanted to see him again. 

We had our one last night together and I said goodbye to him in the morning. I handed him the letter and told him to read it when he misses me. Then I tried to have some composure as I got in the Uber but started crying the second we started to drive away. I remember tears falling down my face as the driver asked me my favorite things were about New York City. 

I am now back home, and I am a complete mess.

I know the future would be difficult, but I also know that the day and a half we spent together has been the realest thing I have ever felt. This is something I am willing to fight for. Fuck it - if he wants to be together I will move to Europe.

I can barely function at my job. My friends are completely confused and ask what the fuck happened to me in a day and a half.

Here’s how it happened. One of my coworkers (who lives in Seattle) forwarded me an Instagram post from Parable’s account. It was a photo of their smashburger. This coworker has visited Columbus a few times and follows a handful of local spots they’ve come to love, and Parable is one of them. Seeing that photo was all the nudge I needed.

I had to swing by Parable anyway to pick up some wine for holiday gifts, so I figured I’d give the burger a try while I was there.

The bun was something else. Soft, light, airy — just better than any burger bun I’ve had. Then I remembered, Oh, right… they’re a pastry kitchen. It all made sense. The meat was perfectly cooked and the cheese had this richness that caught me off guard. Not too much, but enough to make you notice.

I ended up asking one of the staff about it. “What’s up with this burger? What’s this bun? What kind of meat is this?” They explained it, but honestly, I didn’t retain most of it. I was too focused on eating.

Now, I feel like I’m on a mission. I need to try more smashburgers around Columbus to see how this one stacks up. But as of right now? This might be the best one I’ve had in a long time — maybe ever.

Details in post,"Planning to drive from NYC to Acadia in late spring/early summer with an overnight stay somewhere closer to NYC as we're leaving after work and don't want to drive in the dark, so we landed on Connecticut. Goal would be to stay in walkable quaint town (Mayflower Inn is not affordable, looking for around $500 per night max) where we can get a nice dinner when we arrive and go for a walk down a main street in the morning and grab coffee and breakfast before hitting the road.

Also is it ultimately more of a marketing thing for the coffee houses or not really?

1heg8ar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1heg8ar,The Bandeirante truck from 1929. Possibly the first ever automobiles but in Brazil. History in the post below.,"Long before any automaker started manufacturing trucks in Brazil, there was an inventor who created the first 100% Brazilian truck.

JOSÉ AUGUSTO PRESTES’ HISTORY

Born into a wealthy family in Benfica, Portugal, José Augusto Prestes studied mechanical engineering in the United States. In 1891, he participated in an unsuccessful coup to establish a republic in Portugal. Since the king did not fall, he had to come to Brazil.
In the heat of Rio, he began to study about cold storage and opened the first ice factory in the country (before, ice had to come from Europe). The versatile Portuguese did everything: he oversaw the construction of the government palace in Manaus, set up his own steel mill (Usina Santa Luzia), and built and managed the Beira Mar Cassino Teather, in Passeio Público, downtown Rio.

THE BANDEIRANTE TRUCK

The truck was designed and entirely built in Brazil at A. Prestes & C. Ltd., dedicated to manufacturing machines for processing coffee.

Its then-modern facilities in Rio de Janeiro (RL) were equipped with iron, steel, bronze and aluminum foundries, allowing it to produce locally all the parts needed to assemble the vehicle – from the wheels and chassis to the 60 hp engine (with an unknown number of cylinders, it is only known that each one had a displacement of 1718 cm³). With a maximum load capacity of 7 metric tons or 15432,358 lbs, it reached a top speed of 40 km/h or about 24,8 mph.

Named Bandeirante, the truck was presented to the press in early February 1929, according to press reports, the truck was shipped on January 20, 1929, to the Ibero-American Exhibition in Seville. In fact, only 12 days passed between the Bandeirante's presentation in Rio and its shipment to Europe.

The Spanish exhibition, which showcased products from Iberian and Latin American countries, was open for a year - there were people there who doubted that the vehicle was entirely manufactured in Brazil.

After the initial enthusiasm had passed, the newspapers published nothing more about the fate of the pioneering Bandeirante. Thus, there is a good chance that it also became the first Brazilian automobile sold abroad.

When I get home from work, i’m exhausted. i have the overwhelming urge to nap. i NEED to nap. i usually nap for 3-5 hours, and wake up groggy, depressed, and upset. i then muck about for another 3-5 hours and am incapable of doing anything productive or even enjoyable (like my hobbies), only wasting time on social media or tv. then i go back to sleep and wake up for work in the morning to repeat it all again. 6 hour or under shifts i can usually manage to go home and do other things, even if i’m tired. 6+ hour shifts cause the above described. i cant work 6 hour shifts and maintain a full time job though.

I’ve struggled with working for my whole life. After i have a shift i feel horrible. I’ve been working since i was 16 (i’m 22 now) and have had 4 different jobs, all retail. it started small, just being drained after work. but as the years went by i started getting more and more tired after work. it transitioned to naps that helped, but left me feeling helpless at losing so much of my days. a huge fear of mine was that i would move out and start working full time, and it would get worse. 

it did.

i moved out in the past year and it’s miserable. i’m exhausted all the time. i hate my life. everything’s stacked on me constantly. i do nothing but sleep and work. my place is a mess and it makes me more upset because i love my space being tidy. i’m struggling to renew my health insurance and car insurance because i only have two days a week that i can function normally (my days off). 

when my therapist suggested it could be something besides just depression, i was excited to have a fix of some kind. but my blood tests came back normal … likely not a deficiency of any kind. not thyroid issues. 

which leaves the possibility of hypersomnia.

online sources so far have discussed using stimulants to help. i already take those for adhd… they also suggest no coffee, no alcohol, normal bedtime. check, check, and check. i’ve seen mention of some more specialty medications, but i’m afraid they won’t work. I have no proof they won’t. i’m just scared. i don’t know if i can keep living like this. it barely feels worth it. 

I’m just feeling scared and alone. no one in my life seems to understand why i’m so upset about it.

I have friends in my home state and acquaintances here but, no one to just sit around and spend time with, except my S/O. 

He and I go out with a small group of friends here and there and play pickleball almost every week with my coworkers from my last job. I'll also meet up with a few of my past coworkers for drinks or just hanging, but rarely.

I have relations but no one significant except my partner. I know I'm intimidating and rub people the wrong way sometimes. 
Like, in my class, we just finished our first semester and a group of girls really clicked with one another but I had offended them at least two times. Don't ask how because apparently it was a misunderstanding, I have no idea.... anyway, a couple of the girls have reached out to hang or get food after class and I refuse because I rather be home or alone. 

Yet, I still get FOMO and wonder why I have no close friendships. 

I've always been a last minute flake, cancel plans last minute or just not go out and when I have gone out on little coffee dates or shopping or whatever, there's rarely a second or third time. 

I'm not sure how to be more inviting and friendly and worth being around...

It’s my favorite spot in the house—I love sitting there with a book, sipping my coffee, or just enjoying some fresh air. Jake, however, has recently become obsessed with the idea of transforming the balcony into a “zen garden.”

He’s envisioned it with bamboo walls, a rock garden, wind chimes, and even a small water feature. While it sounds nice in theory, his plan would make the balcony unusable for anything else—no chairs, no space to just relax. I wouldn’t even be able to step out there without “ruining the vibe.”

I told Jake I’m not comfortable giving up the only outdoor space we have for his project. I suggested a compromise, like adding a small zen corner or finding ways to incorporate his ideas without making the space entirely impractical. He refused, saying I’m “crushing his creativity” and that he needs a place to decompress after work.

Now he’s upset and calling me selfish, saying I never want to prioritize his needs. I feel guilty because I want him to have a space he loves, but I don’t think it’s fair to sacrifice something we both use and enjoy for his vision.

1heg0le,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1heg0le/feel_free_to_criticize_working_on_something/,"Feel free to criticize, working on something bigger, all comments are welcome ","The lecture hall was modern, well lit, and plain in every aspect. The front of the room drooped lower than the lifted back, not enough to warrant stairs. On the ground laid a boring teal green and grey carpet offset with white lines jotted here or there. The wall, ceiling, and doors were all a putrid off white which reflect the florescent overhanging lights like mirrors. The room was layered within the larger complex in a way that windows would be impossible, apart from on the doors. Large desks made of plastic and cheap wood were on every level of the hall, resembling an oaky color with black rings for electrical wiring. Spinning chairs, also plastic, were of an olive green and black and were dotted behind the desks. The room sat empty and quiet; it was jail cell.

Every level mediocrity, down to the standard issue Dolby projector mounted to the ceiling, was an eyesore to the room’s professor. No matter how many times he had asked for a change in location, the administration staff refused his plea. He then asked for a slight remodel, maybe a different color paint, but such requests were outside the handbook. The professor had even asked to decorate on his own coin, also denied. For now, he was stuck in a room where time felt it could go no slower.

Despite failure, he made do and decorated the small industrial rolling desk with artifacts or trinkets that amused him. It was common for him to swap them out, but this day the desk had the skull of a white-tail deer, along with a matching pelt turned layover blanket drooping over the front side. The desk was empty apart from the deer’s attributes and a small collection of pens.

The professor arrived at his class early and began writing on a large whiteboard in the front of the room ‘NATURE’S BEHAVIOR’. He pulled out a modern laptop and pulled up a few videos of interest on separate tabs. He finally displayed a photograph, HD definition, on the board.

It showed a scene of struggle. A zebra, thrashing within what looked like a river or some over body of water, watching blankly and the utmost terror as his snout and skin was being torn away by crocodiles. The crocodiles, with chucks of flesh limped within their clutches while still attached to the zebra’s head, had zero expressions. The damage showed the entire snout and muzzle of the poor animal as being completely removed; skin completely removed from the bridge of the nose showing only skull. The lower jaw was mangled and chewed, with teeth missing, flesh ripped, ligaments dangling, and blood everywhere. The instantly recognizable zebra print skin was still attached, thrown about in the crocodile’s clench, and was torn like paper. The skin was ripped all the way down the face, stopping just as the muzzle ends and the lower eye lid begins. The water below had turned maroon. Death was immanent, and the zebra’s suffering was catastrophic.

When the first student arrived, about fourteen minutes early to the lecture, they walked in on their phone but were immediately shocked by the imagery, performing a double take before whispering ‘Jesus’ under their breath. Another a few minutes later was visibly shocked and kept darting their eyes on the grotesquery morbidly curious. As more students walked in, the reactions were just as repulsed, until a woman in the back asked, “Why is that on the board?”

“… Did anyone have any questions about the assigned readings?”

The class was silent and kept their eyes away from the board.

“Perfect”

The class became full. Many students were visibly discomforted by the image, but the professor was more focused on the distraction it gave him to the ugly room. He began his lesson on time.

“This seems just about everyone. I have started the online recording for our friends who could not make it due to their situation, reminder, if you need the lecture you need to ask for it. I can give it to you if you can give me a reason to give it to you. I am really getting tired of getting email’s saying ‘sorry I’m sick’ after the lecture already ended. If you need it because of scheduling that’s fine, if you get sick that’s fine, but if I see you sent your email an hour after the class is done, it’ll be as if I never saw it at all. You need to coordinate these things with me beforehand, so from now on if I don’t get an email before four in the afternoon, your lecture recording request isn’t happening. Sorry for that little rant. It seemed like most of you at least looked at the readings this week, did anyone have any pressing thoughts on Breed?”

A hand jumped and a man asked, “I read it, it seemed like it only had to say animals will act like animals … is that right?”

The professor had a plain look on his face. “Well … yes. Morgan’s Cannon, *do not over-credit animal tendencies with humanlike capacities, always look for the simplest explanation.* In fact, Morgan goes further in his original 1894 text, writing, *in no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one that stands lower in the psychological scale…*”

“Doesn’t that … I don’t know … it just feels wrong to consider an animal as nothing more than serving basic needs.”

“True, and to be clear Morgan’s point of view is nothing more than a point of view, but it is one to make our lives much easier. It’s our Occom’s Razor. Thinking with too much humility will lead to us placing our own emotions and feelings on the templates of minds who cannot comprehend them; I can tell you that no animal has ever felt melancholy, or grateful, at least those in the wild, so looking at animals as these ‘thinkers’ does no good. On the other hand, they are not unfeeling piece of flesh. They get scared, and show happiness, and anger … but it’s not to the complexities that we feel. Thinking of animals like cogs leads to a life of misunderstanding, and subsequently mistreatment. Does that answer your question.”

“Basically … thank you”

The professor wrote on the board ‘MORGAN’S CANNON 1894’ along with, ‘GEORGE ROMANES’, and said, “Breed’s other books talk about this more, along with Romanes, poses great questions about what does an animal think … contemplatively. Anyone else?”

“Do we have to stare at that phot for any longer?” said the woman in the back.

“Is it too graphic?”

“It’s disgusting”

“It’s nature, that happens every day”

The woman stayed silent and visibly upset.

“How do humans die?”

No one answered.

“Ok … too broad, how do we often die?”

A young man raised his hand. He sat in the middle and wore casual clothes yet presented himself professionally. He would have seemed naturally comfortable in formal wear. He said “Cancer … disease,” with a mixed eager and confusion.

“Yes perfect, disease, old age, suicide, car crashes, accidents, murder … what a blessing we live comfortably. We do not know what cold means, or hungry, scared, fear, horror; we do not have the ability, or at least very few humans do, to comprehend authentically our primitiveness. We have the luxury to know that, beyond reasonable doubt, out last moments will be quick, painless, in our sleep, hopefully all three. The most modern and cruelest viruses can be numbed with enough morphine and the grizzliest deaths occur quick. Fractions of fractions experience the vicarial.”

Most of the class had figured out why the photo was on the board at this point.

“Our pain is usually emotional. We can’t pay our rent, our girlfriend broke our heart, our mom or dad died, our bosses just fired us. Yes, mental pain is pain, but physical, agonizing torture, that is suffering. That is the fate of nature. Animals don’t get to die quick, and painless, at least not those we study here. These creatures die like this,” pointing at the photo, “it is bloody, it hurts, and its terrifying. They are eaten alive.”

 The rest of the lecture was standard. After the professor’s introduction he removed the photo and put on his presentation. His ZOO 342 class, *Animal Behavior and Ethology*, continued on the readings, looking over major breakthrough studies within nature’s psyche. The class were evidently engaged from the first second and stayed engaged throughout the remainder of the ninety-minute class. The last minute came quickly and cut the discussions short.

“If anyone wants to continue this discussion I can stay after a bit, but I know its 5:30 and you all want to get out of here,” said the professor.

The majority of the class packed and left. The young man came up and faced the professor, who lifted his head from cleaning his desk. “I had a quick question, the zebra, did it survive?”

“No, but it fought like hell, something I bet most of us couldn’t do. An animal’s only goal is survival, no matter how much it hurts.”

The young man thanked the professor and left the room. A few straggled and left slowly. A girl, blonde, young, and thin, was in the back and stayed seated, staring at the professor.



They met later that night at a bar. He had removed his jacket and put on more casual clothes. He smelled different, and his hair had been reshaped. He had chewed mint gum the whole walk from his apartment to the bar and walked quickly. It was dark and cold in the city, puddles in the road. It was September.

The two shared many drinks and talked in the busy bar. The girl had the same thing on from the class but too had altered their presentation. She said something about this being her favorite place in town, but she preferred it when it was quieter and less busy.

“I went here when it had a different name … maybe three years ago.”

“What was it called?”

“I don’t remember, something tacky and Irish”

“Sounds boring”

“You weren’t there, it was fun, more tables though”

The conversation felt forced, and the professor immediately regrated the entire thing. He had begun darting his eyes everywhere except the woman in front of him, checking on the beer he had, or if the people to his right were still there. His uneasiness and general annoyance were to the point of becoming rude. After a silent ten seconds, he asked her, “How are you liking my class?”

“It’s good”

“Good”

She began to hate every minute of this too. Maybe it was the fact that this man had absolutely no ability to small talk. Even still, that wouldn’t be a major problem, small talk is a façade. She knew he didn’t want to be here, and, in that emotion, it made her not want to be there, making him not want to be here either more. It was a spiral, each person becoming more unwilling to keep this charade afloat.

“I don’t like getting drinks with students,” the professor said blunt.

“I don’t like getting drinks with teachers”

“Then why did you invite me?”

“Then why did you come?”

“I have a rather busy morning tomorrow”

“Same”

The energy of the bar was still intense as the woman grabbed her bag and coat and swiftly trotted away. The man had realized she left without paying her tab, but luckily it was only a matter of a drink or two. Much like the classroom, this too became like a prison, situationally. As he paid and left, walking back home, he realized that she will be at his class for the rest of the semester. He wasn’t sure who made it awkward but that awful tensity will be there for at least three months. He started to wonder if he could just fail her and not have to deal with them again, or if he made assigned seating and placed her behind a really tall student in the back, or anything to make sure he didn’t have to deal with it again.

The man pulled his phone out and texted her, having her number from the class earlier. He began to type “*Thanks for making me pay for your tab…”* but deleted it before sending it, as that would make his situation that much worse. He thought for a second and typed, *“This won’t affect your grade btw”* but that had just the same problem, maybe even worse that the first one. He then typed *“Wanna just forget about this”* and sent it before he could think about the repercussions.

*“huh?”*

*“Like the whole thing just a minute ago, pretend like it never happened?”*

*“ig idk”*

*“What do you mean”*

*“u were weird”*

*“I was at a bar I don’t like talking to a nameless student, sorry it wasn’t romantic or whatever you wanted it to be”*

*“nameless? Excuse me?”*

This was not going well and he had to take a minute to think about how he was going to deal with this. He began typing, *“I’m sorry, I just mea……”*

*“fuck you creep, you went to a bar with a girl almost half your age, u like preying on little girls? kys”*



The man got back home, kicked off his shoes and crashed on the couch. His apartment was neat, yet empty, and rather unimportant to him. He only kept this particular apartment because the hassle of moving his limited furniture, bed, and tabling through a doorway too small was hard enough once. It was laid out like a giant ninety-degree angle, being placed on the corner of the building on the fourth floor. He would walk in from the hallway and immediately have to turn left from his makeshift mudroom area into his bedroom. It wasn’t even a room, just another area, as the apartment had very little walls, only blocking off the bathroom and a small half wall near the kitchen. His bed was neat and full sized, in the corner, so he could look around and see a nice view as he was sleeping. Turning left again there was a large leather couch only a few feet away from the bed against the outermost wall with a nice tv on the opposite wall. The bathroom and kitchen were in the back of this L shaped place. It was empty, and the fake hard wood flooring had no rugs to hid it. On his walls was not a single photo, and there was no life in here apart from him. A coffee table was empty, save two Ducks Unlimited magazines over a year old. It was all ever so clean and cold.

His only decorations were mounts. Too many of them. It was to the point that one could mistake the wall behind the TV with a museum of big game. Buck, white tail deer, moose, a bear, a wolf, a bison, multiple trout, and a side table of skulls and antlers. Many times, guests would come and audibly be shocked at his collection of carcasses. They all were on wooden plates with only a date etched and torched in. This place, this apartment, was not a haven or a retreat, but a trophy room.

As he sat, he thought about what the woman had said, *u like preying on little girls?* It was obviously misleading. He was barely thirty-five and she couldn’t have been younger than twenty-one. Many have made that age gap worked. He wondered, why did he even go in the first place. Yes, she was attractive, but he knew that the second he was in the room the excitement would be over, and she would open her mouth, and he would remember why he didn’t even know her name at the beginning of the day. The chase of it all was the most enjoyable part of it. The feeling of going after her, with the sense of risk that came with it. Nothing illegal or sinister, but definitely taboo. Even if she hadn’t been as attractive as she was, she was a student, and he was a professor. It was a hunt. An artificial one at best but something he had been avoid of for what felt like months, and he had gotten sloppy, like a tiger who lets their prey free before pouncing. He could have done so much better, paid attention to what she was saying, look her in the eyes, complement her on her looks, smile, be charming, be able to be charmed. Truthfully, he didn’t care for her much and had very little time to prepare or think through the whole situation, leading to the disastrous end.

He began to look again at the mounts on his walls. Each one of them was an animal he had slain himself. There were opportunities for him to collect other’s trophies but even thinking that was disingenuous. Everyone, a bullet he had cocked, an arrow he had drawn, a knife he had stabbed. It was necessary for him to have been responsible for the bloodshed. A feeling of satisfaction, curing his needs. That of the lion, jaw clenched on the neck of a wild buffalo, slowly chewing and licking at the wound as the buffalo wails and cries and collapses down in pain, just for the lion to release for just a split second to tear away at the jugular in a different spot. His lock pick was violent, and his gate door was a civilized façade.

That girl meant nothing to him, and he had already forgotten everything about her. There are millions of women that he could go after with much better attributes, intellect, style, and sense, and chances are he could find one quick. He knew how to try, and he had a fortunate face and body. It didn’t even need to be that of lust, he just needed to hunt, something. Someone. Luckily it was September, and he could venture off to the woods to bandage his aching.",1,1734220504.0,shortstory,1,1.0,False

On my days off, I help out at the shop for fun. While I was in med school, I became a regular at this local café, and over time, I got to know the staff pretty well. Eventually, I met my wife there. Around the same time, I started a local DnD group. Before each game, I’d order coffee using my players' character names, which they all loved. The staff also found it fun and started calling me by my character’s name, which I thought was charming.
Fast forward to a recent day at work, where I was chatting with a coworker (30s, let’s call her Jane) during our break. I mentioned my DnD campaign, and Jane seemed really interested. She asked if she could sit in on one of the sessions, and I invited her to join that evening. We drove to my wife’s café afterward (driving isn’t common where I live, but I have a car). When we entered the café, the staff greeted me loudly, calling me by my DnD character name, and then began reading out the coffee orders using the players’ character names. Jane immediately froze. Her face turned red, and she looked visibly uncomfortable. I asked if she was okay, and she just scoffed. I offered to get her a drink, and she asked, with a tone I couldn’t quite place, if she was supposed to give a character name too. I assured her she could use her real name, unless she wanted to use a DnD name. She quickly declined, ordered, and then we paid.
My wife came out from the back to greet me with a kiss, and I introduced her to Jane. My wife’s language skills aren’t perfect because she moved to this country in her teens, so she doesn’t speak as fluently as most people here. Jane gave her a dirty look, which didn’t go unnoticed by either of us. My wife raised an eyebrow, but still greeted her politely. Jane didn’t make much effort to engage with my wife, so we switched to English to talk about our day. After a few minutes, Jane grabbed her drink, and I asked if she was ready to come watch the campaign. She suddenly said she didn’t want to watch anymore and wanted to go home. I offered to drop her off so she didn’t have to pay for the subway, but she declined.
On the way to my house, my wife and I discussed how weird Jane had acted. The campaign itself went great, and I was kind of bummed Jane didn’t come, especially since she’d seemed interested. The next day, I asked Jane what happened and if she’d gotten cold feet. She snapped at me, accusing me of embarrassing her in front of the “cute barista” by using the DnD names. She told me I should just use normal names and said I was weird, which was why I don’t have work friends. I was pretty taken aback and apologized again, but she just got angrier, called me a weirdo, and walked off.
I generally try to keep my work life separate from my personal life, and I didn’t think anything of using DnD names in front of Jane. It’s something the staff and my players enjoy. But now I’m wondering if I really messed up. AITA for embarrassing Jane by using the DnD names at the café?",11,1734220373.0,AmItheAsshole,32,0.92,False

1hefuuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1hefuuk/main_timeline/,Main Timeline,"OK this has bugged me from the jump.

At Lanes shower Luke sells the boat that Liz said he's had 20 years since his dad died.

Maisy and Budd helped Luke open the diner so Luke's has been open 20 years.Call it 18 as it took a while to settle probate remodel and start up.

At the time of the date Lorelai is like 36yo .Because the first date was about 2 years before Luke sold the boat. This is because Rory was 21 during Lanes shower and 21+ 16 is 37... Close enough for horseshoes 36 - 18 equals 18.

So Lorelai was 18 when the diner opened and had been in SH for 1-2 years.

Great - we know Luke pined for Lorelai 8 years so 36 - 8 = 28. 

My first issue is that the opening of a new diner would be big news. Lorelai the coffee fiend didn't go to Luke's for 10 years?

Here's my second problem. During the delayed Christmas there is a discussion about Luke's gift giving  skills . Rory said she got monogrammed towels, a few more occasions of monogrammed stuff and specifically 5 years of Unicorn items.

Now Luke isn't the most sensitive guy but if this is true then Luke gave Rory gifts of unicorns from age 10-15? That makes no sense especially as it would have been super creepy to meet coffee fiend and immediately start buying her 10yo daughter gifts especially as slow as Luke moves emotionally - Luke and Lorelai's friendship would have to establish before that happened - and Luke would have hated coffee fiend a lot before he warmed up to her.. So 11-16 Even Luke isn't so clueless to give a 16yo Rory unicorn stuff. These are gifts more like 6-11yo.

When I first heard the horoscope story and the 8 years pining I tilted and it's always bugged me.

It makes much more sense that Luke and Lorelai met whe Rory was a toddler say 4-5 or something. I reckon she didn't have much time  to get out of the Inn what with work and caring for an infant until then . It's also just because how much Luke has been a part of Rory's life more than anything based on gifting and how much he cares for Rory.

This would have put Lorelai at 22-23 when she met Luke and made the pining a much more crazy 14 years or so.

Anyhow my other nit is why didn't Budd and Maisy get any call backs? I know they were only a plot point to stress how serious the all in comment was as Luke has exposed ""Luke has a Lukes""

On none of Luke and Lorelai's dates do they ever even mention going to Sniffy's Tavern for dinner. Luke goes there 3X a week.

Finally  even if I am wrong about all this, 5-10 year old Rory would already start being the town darling - We know she was in Ms. Patties pageants, ballet school and already mascotting many of the towns festivals. Basically they must have known each other prior to crazy coffee lady walking in.

I would be willing to chalk it up to Luke hyperbole but Lorelai's reaction supported a first time meeting.

OK. I'm done. Please someone correct my math or assumptions - LOL

Do you ever feel like you're living in something close to those world? ,"New to this subreddit, I'm sure you guys have such discussions all the time! This is my first time :)

Its funny I note down my dreams pretty much daily since the last 20+ years, but never thought much of them.

I've had some really nice dreams, and the world is like a ""map"" from a video game. I've had these dreams since I was a child. Almost all of my dreams take place in this map, in different places. They all seem to be based here on some version of the Earth, and 90% of the dreams are very peaceful. There are recurring ""characters"" both from my real life and people who only exist in the dream world.

So in my dreams..

1. There is a beautiful, sparkling clean city with high rises on the waterfront. What's crazy is that I've had this location in my mind since I was a kid in a 3rd world country without running water and electricity. I'd never even known of such a place existing. There are pristine shopping malls, and rooftop patios where I am in the clouds looking around at the buildings and the bay that surrounds the city.

Funny enough, I now live in San Francisco and the location (waterfront, high rises, most of SF is clean btw despite what the media shows) matches eerily. The Salesforce tower feels so familiar to me and I was surprised to learn it was built only a few years ago. Driving into SF from Oakland on the Bay Bridge, watching the city skyline, is overwhelming for me because it brings up a bunch of these emotions. The view from the park near where I live gives me goosebumps every single day.

2. I would hop in a car and drive away from the city to a amusement park. There's California's Great America in San Jose.. I've never been there. If I'm in the car I basically drive anywhere I want - I really enjoy driving and I just drive aimlessly to places I like and its like a mashup of a futuristic looking very clean and pristine LA, SF, NYC, etc. It is usually raining.

3. Sometimes, I'd visit some temples. I'm Hindu and I have some great memories visiting temples with my grandfather. In these dreams I'd go into the mountains where it is snowing like crazy, and find a temple where it is frozen solid outside, save for the entrance, and inside it was warm and brightly lit. I'd find a lot of comfort there. Of course, I don't think such a place exists.

4. Once in a while, I go visit my grandparents, and my grandfather (he has passed away) is still alive and I smell the chai, feel the humid heat, and walk around in the alleys I remember from my childhood. I relive all the memories (some made up of course) with them, and I remember the railways and going on long aimless walks with my grandfather.

5. Then there are the smaller towns and cities. My favorite is one on the beach, where the way there is through mountains and as you descend you see the beautiful ocean. It sort of reminds me of driving down Malibu Canyon Road to the beach, except the town was much friendlier and the beaches were nicer. The other towns are a college town where I sometimes go into a big library and for some reason I just think about things from my real life there. I have no idea how that's possible but when I wake up I feel like I've got a new answer to some problem I was stuck on. I have only ever been to this beach at night, and somehow the whole beach is lit up with tiki torches and people are enjoying it even at night.

6. There's a forest though which I take a train or drive through, and there's always either snow or heavy rain fall. There's a big river, and it is always raging. This part of the world not well mapped out, and I've only been here a few times. The train ride is always pleasant and I meet the same people over and over.

7. A huge airport where I'm never really on the flight but always in line or waiting lol. Any time I've gotten on the plane the dream ends. This is a weird one because it isn't fully mapped out, but I've been there enough times I am familiar with the baggage area, waiting lobbies, and so on.

4 and 5 are my favorite dreams, and I cherish them the most. 5 is the only dream that is always consistently pleasant.

However, in 5-10% of cases, some dreams end in some absolutely catastrophic ways. I've seen these multiple times and they're burned into my brain.

In the city, there'd be some alarm and I go into underground areas with thousands of other people, and I almost always end up next to the same woman as we wait out whatever is about to happen. There's always heavy rain and lightning just before, and around evening time. There are underground labyrinths that are well-developed, with tunnels and it is honestly a little scary haha. I've seen weird looking figures sometimes behind glass walls (like someone wearing a chunky body suit), but they don't ever react to me. 

Another city scenario is when it is very cloudy and foggy (pretty common in SF which I love haha) and I'm on a roof top. There's a light rain that starts and then a huge booming horn (like a trumpet almost) and out of the sky come these massive sea shell looking space ships and the dream ends.

Sometimes when I visit that icy temple and come back from the mountain, there's some red mushroom looking thing that falls out of the sky and explodes like a nuclear blast. Every single time, it happens right after I meet up with my dad and we are drinking a coffee or something at some town.

In that forest, the storms get worse and worse and eventually I get off the train and I come to a dead-end at the river where its raging too much and I just sit at a bench and watch logs and other debris go by.

I'm always at the beach town during night, but if I'm there in the day I come out of a shed and I see a huge beam coming out of the sky ""drilling"" into the earth. The source is this huge thing in the sky and its just focusing this beam down.

I've had a few other dreams that were really terrifying, and these are super rare. One was I'm driving behind another SUV during a heavy snowfall in some mountains. We come to a stop and look down and its like a massive reservoir in a ravine/valley that seems to never end. It is honestly terrifying, I can't describe how small it made me feel.

Drinking coffee and doing the MyFaction dailies. In the evenings I would log on again to get the daily log-in ""bonus"" and complete any eligible Live events. It was pretty sad.

It was always in pursuit of earning MyFaction Points in order to open packs and unlock cards. Persona cards were the hook.

Was playing the womans fatal fourway live event this evening...and I just was not having fun. At all. It was so frustrating. 

Decided enough was enough. Used my 100 or so accumulated MFP to unlock persona Chad Gable. Not bothered about the remaining persons: Becky, Trick and a few  n64 style variants. I had unlocked nWo Curt Hennig and Randy Savage, but who cares: Hennig wrestles in a shirt on and Savage with a bandana and he looks crap. Both can't be edited either. Where's the real incentive? 

My PS5 wrap-up showed 2k24 as my 2024 most played game with a whopping 829 hours, with most of that attributed to MyFaction (game platinum'ed too). That amount of time dedicated to a game, let alone one which in many ways is a chore, is insane.

I look back at my trophies and time played on 2k16/17/18/19...all under 300 hours. No platinums. A good lot of trophies acquired through basic play. That's the way it should be, for fun. And MyFaction is not that.

- Faction Wars is repetitive garbage.

- The Weeky Towers are also boring and lack any real appeal.

- Proving Grounds is more dull grinding with bizarre sub-challenges which provide pitiful rewards. 

- The daily ""challenges"" are demented in terms of the work/award comparison. Want a mere 75 mfp? (Which you can get with 5 standard move challenges)...simply damage 8 legs in Faction Wars.

- Live Events are poorly thought out and often highly unfair.

- The Online element is so unreliable it's a rarity to actually get a match loaded in...not that you would want to because it's an absolute sewer, devoid of any fun.

I played 2k22 for a total of 1023 hours. I was solid on MyFaction as it was a new mode etc. 2k23 I just played enough MyFaction to get the trophies toward the platinum. My hours fot 2k23? 325. Big difference.

I'm looking forward to 2k25, but I'm steering clear of MyFaction. It's just a waste of time. Just wish I dumped it sooner.

I’ve made some great friends through this sub. Mostly they are girls, and we all have a great time together when we hang out. Have some guy friends too, but none of them are particularly close friends that I chat to or hang out with regularly.

I did have other male friends in the last few years that got close to but none of those friendships worked out. They just turned out to be not very good people. 

The reason for my post is that I miss having the boy banter and chats. My best friend who is a guy moved back to his country three years ago. I’ve done a few hangouts through this sub and have met some amazing people who have become very close friends of mine. 

If anyone is up for it I could arrange a group hangout or even a one-on-one thing. I’m not much of a drinker but always happy to go to a bar or even coffee.

A bit about me, I’m a gym guy - I go really early in the morning. I live Downtown, really into coffee and food, love horror movies, K-dramas,  enjoy visiting cafes and generally enjoy chatting about anything. 

If you are interested you can comment and I’ll DM you, or you can DM me with a little about yourself. :)",8,1734219359.0,Vancouver4Friends,7,1.0,False

Before you think life gets easy and you figure it all out. No. It keeps being complicated. He is an amazing man. Brilliant, artistic, cultured, worldly, funny, cooks, great in bed. I am multi-talented too. All of the above too. For the most part, the relationship, as I saw it, was great. We had a lot of passion at first and I left someone for him, so he pursued me very heavily and romantically. I gave in. He grew on me. Now his faults: he could be overly critical, he had a high demand for personal time and worked a lot. When he isn’t working, he goes out of town for long periods of time to see his kids. There’s nothing fishy about it. He never gets to see his kids, except if he goes to see them so he’ll spend a couple weeks. The separations have been really hard for me. I tried to be very cool about it, but I think it shown through that I was lonely, and I resented being left alone for long periods of time. The other problem was, I felt like when he was around if anything popped up the one thing he would do to make time in his day would be to shorten time with me or Work while he was with me. I think he knew this was somewhat inappropriate because a lot of times he would ask me if it was OK, forcing me to say yes that it would be OK but in my head, I didn’t really always think it was OK cut two this week. He told me he needed to do a lot of work and he was extremely defensive about it. I made a comment about. When will I see you and he really jumped on that and was kind of aggressively telling me to back off like I didn’t understand that he needed the time to work on Tuesday morning. He had stayed at his apartment and we both work together so he asked me if I had gotten to work. It’s a big building. We don’t work together together, but we work for the same organization in different respects, I didn’t see him all morning although he asked me if I was there and then I actually bumped into him while getting a coffee. He didn’t really look up from his phone and stop texting and give me any attention and then he asked me if I wanted to go back to his office to eat the snack I bought so I did and he stayed on his computer that whole time and didn’t look up at me or talk to me. I went back to my office. I have to admit in a bit of a huff. There was a knock at my door and he showed up and basically asked me what my ring size was now everybody I’ve talked to you about this has said that was really manipulative of him. I left work that day didn’t stop by to see him. He had asked if I’d left I said yes and then later, I asked him what his afternoon look like to see if he was gonna come over for dinner. He told me a couple of chores he had to do go to the post office and then he announced and I had a bowl of soup so I responded. Oh well that means I should just go ahead and cook dinner you know and he said oh I’m sorry did we have plans for dinner? Did I miss something? I explained that no but we usually eat together. He said he was coming over but would probably work the whole time and was that OK? I said yes. he disappeared into the office and after about a half an hour came downstairs. I had already eaten. He expected me to stop what I was doing and talk to him and when I implied that well he’s been really busy all day so I really don’t have much to talk to him about. He got mad and grabbed his stuff and went to leave. I got upset. I didn’t understand why he was suddenly leaving. we got in an argument about how while I was staying away for the past couple of days I had been acting weird and I admit I was acting a little bit weird it was hard for me to take but in no way did I stop him from doing what he needed to do, but he got really really angry at me. He made a comment like if this it’s a shame if this only lasted six months and so I started crying. The whole thing felt surreal long story short too late he left and I called him and I said look all we have to do is say we love each other and that will work on it. That’s all you have to say is that you love me and he said I don’t think I can say that right now and I hung up on him. I think we broke up just then. But I don’t get it because I thought things were going really well up until that point and you know being with someone who works a lot that takes a lot to get used to and he didn’t seem to wanna stand for me not getting on board right away, but I have needs too.  Anyway, now we haven’t spoken or communicated in anyway since Wednesday morning when I walked in his office and dropped off his camera and his apartment key. I assumed we broke up, so I am going no contact. This is really hard for me because I am an anxious attachment person and I do tend to want to take care of the person. I’m with and be around them a lot. I keep running in my head all the things that were said and I just don’t get why we broke up so here’s my question. 

What do you think about no contact ? Has it worked for anybody to get their ex back? Am I doing the right thing? I feel like I’m doing the right thing, but this is really hard and I also worry that I’m sending the message that I don’t care which is the absolute opposite. What do you think?

Growing up in my family we usually ate once a day in the house. We also ate a normal amount of calories. I've been logging how much I regularly eat on a day to day basis since I had an interest in losing weight. I eat 700-900 calories a day, a meal + snacks and a couple of coffees. I've always had a trash metabolism too... like bad.

I thought maybe I wasn't logging correctly but I checked in with my brother who's really into fitness and successfully lost a lot of weight, and he said I was doing it right. 

Anyway, how would I go about losing weight? A lot of the steps I see online say to cut calories first but I don't think that would be healthy? I've started to eat only veggie-based meals (roasted cauliflower, broccoli soup, etc) and replaced sugar/snacks with fruits. But I haven't seen any progress after 8 days. 

I think the lowest weight I'd ever been at and successfully kept it off for a while was at 138 lbs, but I only ate boiled eggs... for like a month. It was bad and I don't want to do that again. 

Exercise is also something I'm trying to incorporate too but it's hard since I'm a student and work two jobs. But I've stopped taking the bus and started walking daily to where I need to go (1 hour a day or so).

1hefmmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Water_Fasting/comments/1hefmmv/had_a_bad_experience_looking_for_input/,"Had a bad experience, looking for Input","I’m curious if anyone else has experienced what I just went through. I was 182 hours into a water fast and I ended it prematurely. I felt great throughout until I did a little physical activity. 

My glucose was 63 and ketones 5.2 at the time of the activity. All I did was go to the store and carry some somewhat heavy bundles of wood. I was planning to go cycling the next day, but this bit of activity has that in question now. 

After I carried the wood, I started to feel a little dizzy and had general muscle weakness. Once I got home, I tested my ketones to find the meter giving me a generic ‘HI’ reading. I didn’t even know they had that setting. I tested again and got 7.3. My glucose had not changed a bit. 

I tried to wait out the bad feelings, but I didn’t feel it getting better, so I ended the fast with eggs and a little salami. I’m Keto and wanted to keep the carbs low instead of a big shock to my system with carbs, but I will and would do carbs if needed. 

It’s been about 15 mins and I feel back to normal. My glucose has creeped up to 72 and the ketones went back down to 5.1. 

With that physical activity, the only thing that changed was a boost in ketones and that caused all my problems. I’m not type 1, so I’m not worried about ketoacidosis, but I never expected my ketones to go so high. It was most likely the highest it’s ever been, but this is the first fast I’ve had use of the ketone meter. 

I also got a cramp in my abdominal muscle after eating, so I took another magnesium and some electrolytes. I wasn’t following a schedule to take my supplements and I won’t make that mistake again. I do not know if that had anything to do with the ketone boost that led to the dizziness and weakness, but the condition was present. 

I’ve had several fasts where my glucose was this low and lower. I have no idea of my ketone levels during those fasts. I did not do any heavy physical activity during the previous fasts. Just normal work and walks. 

I’ll take a break before embarking on another water fast. The absolute only thing different with this fast than all the others I’ve done is that this one was the cleanest. The others, I typically had cream with my coffee the first 3 days or so of the fast. I can say that this fast was by far the easiest. The only strong hunger pangs I had was at the point my glucose dropped and ketones popped up from 2.4 to 5.1. This was my transition upon burning up my glycogen. 

I’m 6 ft tall and 229 lbs. My goal is to get to 198. I have a muscular build and carry the current weight well.   I suspect my body has to acclimate to using ketones. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

1heflxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1heflxj/i_feel_like_im_undatable/,I feel like I’m undatable ,"So to start I just need to vent about my current dating life and experiences either it as I have no one else in my life to really talk about the way I feel without getting blown off or being told “don’t worry you’re young” or “it’s okay to be single”

So I’m a 21 year old dude, just turned 21 a few months ago and currently my dating life is dead. I’ve had two long term relationships that lasted 2 years and then my last one was a year and a half and both of them were shitty and they were a bit abusive at times towards me. I was dumped back in August by my ex and since then I’ve had no luck and it’s always seemed this way. I constantly get ghosted or like recently I went on 5 dates with girl, though it was great, though I finally found someone into me then I wake up with a “you’re a good guy but I’ve never been filling it, hope you understand” text. Personally I didn’t really care as it just seems like my luck but currently o have no options and just a dry ass dating life.

I’m not trying to be full of myself or hype myself up but I think I’m attractive and I constantly get compliments from family, friends, coworkers or just random people but yet I struggle to find someone. I’m 6’3 220lbs (I go to the gym every day and have gone from really scrawny to muscular) and pretty much think i should have no problem. I never seem to get compliments from people my age though that are girls,even in relationships I never got compliments and  most compliments come from people 25 and up. I get told all the time how “I’m a good looking dude” or “i bet it’s hard to keep the girls off of you” or “you’ll have no problem getting people” and yet here I am with the driest dating life. I’ve never had a girl approach me, flirt with me (to my knowledge), ask for my number, or show general interest. Although I’m guilty of this too as I’ve never approached anyone and if I did I wouldn’t know what to say.

So one of my main issues is that I really don’t go to a lot of places where I can meet people. I live in a very rural county in the south where most big towns are 40 minutes to an hour away and they don’t have much to do. I’m not interested in chicks in bars or clubs and I’m not interested in hookups. I pretty much go to work, the gym (which has girls but no one talks to each other) and college (which has the same issue as the gym, no one interacts). I have plenty of hobbies such as hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, traveling, farming/homesteading (I do things like make honey, roast coffee, make syrup, eggs and so on) but none of these gets me out to meeting people except maybe selling at a farmers market stuff I make. I go to church but there are no people my age besides my buddies and their girlfriends and everyone else is in high school or are 30 and married. I’ve never had luck on dating apps so that out of the picture. So honestly I’m not sure what to do about meeting people.

So overall I have no luck dating. I seem to get stuck with people who don’t care about me or I get ghosted. It honestly sucks because my buddies have girlfriends who truly love and care about them, I can tell because they do little things for them and they always seem so happy. I seem to never have any luck and I wonder what’s wrong with me. Why do I struggle so much when others have it easy. Honestly I feel like something is wrong with me and I should just give up as I seem to have no luck. All I want is a girl that loves me and that I can love her and we can build a life together but that seems to much to ask for.

1hefd3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1hefd3e/i_harmed_myself_and_was_referred_to_social/,I harmed myself and was referred to social services ,"Last year I was very unwell. I had severe prenatal depression and a severe chronic skin condition where it got to the point I couldn’t use cutlery or dress myself any more. Then I was unwell with HELLP syndrome/pre-eclampsia. 
My birth was horrible and we were both kept in the hospital for a while. I had been diagnosed with trauma after. A few weeks after that I experienced postpartum psychosis and to cut the story short, by the time my child was 6 months old I had spent around 4 months in psychiatric hospitals. As time went on bouncing from hospital to hospital, it all just seemed to become more traumatising. I’m currently having psychology to help with what happened.

In and out of hospital, eventually I got sectioned under the mental health act as things weren’t improving and I had become frequently manic with suicidal intent. There was an incident where I lashed out on my arms with a knife repeatedly (gosh, that hurts to write down). My child was asleep away from where it happened in his own room. By this stage, our household was shattered by the stress of everything that had happened. If I was well, I would have never had done this. 

After this I had a MARU referral (social services) and they did an assessment which took about a month plus a week or two. 

I was just so incredibly unwell, I am flabbergasted how that all happened.

To paint a picture of myself - I’m an incredibly independent 30 year old who has accomplished lots whether that be work wise or life experiences. I treasure meaningful relationships, value family and have have strong values that I’ve never steered away from. I am not reckless, never taken drugs and I abstain from alcohol. My idea of a good weekend is drinking hot chocolates on the moors, baking cakes in my pjs and planning constant adventure packed memory making days out for my little one. 

My goodness I love my child and I’m not a bad mum or a neglectful one. I never have been. I am scared every day the most beautiful thing in my life could be taken from me.

How on earth do I process the shame of having a social services referral and I ask myself whether I will ever feel free from the  worry services may be involved again. 

I feel in pain most days about everything that’s happened. I was outside the other day and could hear the beautiful surroundings where I live. I asked myself whether one day I could enjoy this with a coffee and book outside, instead of the anguish in my mind clouding over everything.

Ps - once the assessment was done, the case was closed as no further help needed. My son had been with his dad at home and I was no longer under section. 
Over a year out of hospital, I’m doing great. Possibly coming off all meds soon and discharged from the specialist mental health team in next few months :)

Thank you for taking the time to read.


Additional last minute edit - thanks for some kind comments I’ve read so far. Unfortunately my what I thought would be forever marriage is now going through the divorce process. I think some scars are too deep to heal. After last year, I can say I am strong and well equipped for this. We currently live together under same roof and we carry on as a loving family, just not one where the parents can align on their romantic side of things any more. Would love for reconciliation but feel he can’t see me in the same light. Most times I feel it’s my fault - During psychotic times I said some awful things, sometimes I conveniently don’t remember and it comes up in conversation and I’m shaken by it. What I put everyone through, the things I said. I probably would’ve given the devil a run for his money during that time. Even the social services report and hospital notes were awfully written (about things I awfully said or done)….",27,1734218501.0,Parenting,12,0.94,False

So eventually the best friend of the main director (her assistant) got her fired and attempted to take her job. 

At first I did not mind the idea of it because that Assistant liked me and I did not realize what she was doing. She would come into my classroom and talk to me about awful things calling the other staff names like “b*tch and wh*re” she was constantly talking about everyone on staff and even when I would ask her to stop or change the subject she would literally continue to talk smack. My last straw was when she googled another teachers divorce and said she had done it with the teacher next door. I felt this was CRAZY inappropriate. As scary as it was I went to HR and told them everything I even supplied evidence. She even told me that our new director was involved in a VERY adult group chat with the other directors and got in big trouble by HR the woman involved in the chat was the head of all preschools within the company. HR said it would be best if I tell my the lady who run the schools let’s call her N and that I would be kept anonymous. 

N did NOT keep me anonymous after I reported the Assistant Director would come into my classroom and tell me “I know when people go to HR” and she would smile at me and wave. She started telling parents that I don’t teach the kids and all I do is yell  at them and have them watch tv (literally not true I’m very soft spoken and our requirements don’t allow me much tv time)  parents were switching there kids out of my classroom left and right. The girls on the staff refused to acknowledge or talk to me I had zero idea what I did wrong. The teacher next door was entering my classroom and taking pictures anytime she did not like my lesson plan or anytime the trashcan was full ( this was NOT fair because it would happen hours after my departure) I had zero control.  One of the parents that did like me pretty much told me the teacher next door was attending birthday parties and asking parents to place them in her classroom and promising them stuff. I got a new assistant and on the first day she told me the girls warned her not to befriend me. She reported it to HR and now we are good friends. My first year it was NOT like this at all I would go out to eat and grab coffee with the girls! once I took that manager to HR she completely pitted everyone against me. 

Another thing to note is at this school we teach things like Morse Code, The Process of Mummification, and Ancient Greek Gods I never was able to do things like fine motor or scissor skills. This bothered me and on top of that we sent out five page homework packets and I had to grade them and send them back. 

ALSO… we had a rat infestation and a child ATE RAT POOP with his snack on accident and we got a message in the group chat that we are not to tell the parents of what happened. 

In conclusion this was my experience as a first year teacher I don’t think this is normal I LOVED being a teacher and I really REALLY want to go back in August but I’m scared so please leave any personal experiences or words of encouragement! All of these women would tell me on the daily I’m a terrible teacher and watch me cry and laugh so I am hoping it’s not like this everywhere I wanna prove myself that I am a good teacher and not to listen to their opinions.

1hef9y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRBsnark/comments/1hef9y0/i_think_the_fact_that_gypsy_talked_about_the/,I think the fact that Gypsy talked about the microdeletion & what it could mean for her child on Kail’s podcast for an extended period of time is a strategic PR move by lifetime & is an indicator of something being wrong  ,"On Kail’s barely famous podcast Gypsy was asked about the specific microdeletion she has, and then she was asked and answered Kail’s questions about what implications the microdeletion could have for her child. This peaked my attention & I was honestly not expecting Gypsy to talk about the microdeletion in the slightest; I was even more caught off guard by the fact that she talked about the possible health implications her daughter could face if she were to inherit the chromosome abnormalities. 

I say this because it’s very very verrryy risky for Gypsy to even bring the slightest bit of public attention to the fact that she has a chromosome microdeletion because it literally jeopardizes the entire narrative that the general public has been sold by her defense team, lifetime, her family and Gypsy herself about Dee Dee having MBP.  

Alls it take is a teeny tiny bit of curiosity from the public to look further into Gypsy’s microdeletion for the general public’s opinion of Gypsy’s credibility to shift DRASTICALLY after discovering that Gypsy needed all the procedures and that all the surgeries were medically necessary and not medical child abuse. It’s not hard at ALL to discover all the information that’s out there on Gypsy’s medical records, the previous claims both she and her family has made, and the symptoms we can personally see she has with our own eyes that make it clear that Gypsy is effected by the microdeletion and isn’t asymptotic like she says she is. Therefore, it would then inevitably cause the public to call into question the legitimacy of the claim that Gypsy was  a victim of MBP. 

If mass public opinion falls out of Gypsy’s favor due to general public suddenly becoming aware of just the sheer amount of lies, deception, manipulation, exploitation, gaslighting, inconsistencies, fabrication, antisocial narcissistic immoral and unethical behavior that Gypsy has engaged in inorder for her to profit, monetize and capitalize off of her crime, then suddenly Gypsy looses all marketability meaning lifetime will loose their return on their investment and make zero profit off of Gypsy (who for all intent and purposes is their product because Gypsy is the main subject of their show, and their ability to make money literally relies SOLELY on Gypsy’s public image sparking enough curiosity in the public for viewers to watch her show). 

So lifetime has to control Gypsy’s public image in order to keep her in a favorable light so that the public will watch her show all so they can profit off of the show. She is the product that lifetime has to market that’s the number one goal. Gypsy’s personal agenda or individual preferences of how she would like navigate how she’s perceived among the general public long term comes secondary due to tye contract that she signed with lifetime. They have sole control over her. And the only thing lifetime is worried about is profiting off of the coming season(s) that she’s contracted to do. They don’t care about how her public image will be once the show is over in the long term. They are only focusing on the short term. 

So, I believe Gypsy having to go on Kail’s podcast and talk about the microdeletion and what it means in terms of her daughter is something lifetime forced her to do as a PR strategy  to introduce the idea of Gypsy’s daughter having medical complications due to the microdeletion to the public in order to preserve her marketability so that they can make money from the show. 

Because if Gypsy’s daughter has the microdeletion and has health complications because of the microdeletion, then it’s going to have catastrophic consequences on Gypsy’s public image and her future marketability in the public spotlight as an influencer, reality tv star, or her version of  “advocacy”. It would go one of two ways: 

1. The public thinks Gypsy has MBP and is medically abusing her child in the same ways she claims her mother did. Which would naturally cause the public to view her as a predator and possibly an abusive monster. 

Or 


2. The public starts to question and look further into the legitimacy and credibility of Gypsy’s narrative of being a victim of MPB by her mother forcing her to get surgeries and procedures that were medically unnecessary because she was perfectly healthy. And they realize that gypsy was actually sick and that Dee Dee didn’t have MPB because they will see her daughter having the same exact issues and medical interventions that Gypsy had as a child that she claims were not needed like the feeding tube, the vision abnormalities, dental complications, microcephaly, wheel chair for muscle atrophy, failure to thrive, developmental delays, behavioral problems and psychiatric conditions. That would mean that the public at large would realize the fact that Gypsy, her family, lifetime, her defense team and the mainstream media has lied to them about EVERYTHING surrounding the murder, Gypsy’s childhood, her health, her mother, Nick, the scamming and con Gypsy participated in with her mother, the motive behind the murder, and the scenario that Gypsy was in leading up the murder that she claims are the reason why she had to commit the murder to “save her own life” from the medical abuse Dee Dee was perpetuating on her. 


I think the fact that she talked about the microdeletion and her daughter possibly having it and possibly having health problems because of it after Gypsy claiming the genetic testing came back normal points to the fact that Gypsy and lifetime are aware of her daughter medical complications or there being medical complications with her pregnancy (the small belly, IUGR is the first thing my mind goes to). 

So Lifetime has to figure out a way to try and roll out an entire new narrative, one that literally contradicts EVERYTHING that Gypsy’s public profit, narrative, and public perception has been thus far. 

There zero chance lifetime or Gypsy would ever ever ever take the chance to bring more public attention to the chromosome disorder because it literally risks EVERYTHING. So that means that there’s a SPECIFIC reason why she agreed to talk about the microdeletion on Kail’s podcast and answer her questions. It’s a PR strategy lifetime is implementing in order to try and preserve and protect their product (Gypsy) that they’ve invested money into for profit. They are trying to slowly introduce the possibility of Gypsy’s daughter having medical issues so that the public doesn’t freak out if they see her daughter having the same exact issues that Gypsy had as a child that Dee Dee had treated for her like good parents do. 

They are trying to slowly warm the public up to the idea of Gypsy’s child needing specialized medical care   Because they know the catastrophic storm that’s most likely coming their way. This PR nightmare  that could absolutely destroy lifetime’s ability to make money and get a return on the investment they made in Gypsy Rose. They are scrambling to try and preserve her marketability and public image. And that’s why I believe that entire interview on Barley Famous was 10000% produced by lifetime. and that the episode as a whole was entirely the network’s doing in terms of which questions Kail asked as a host and the manner in which Gypsy answered the questions all so they can protect, preserve, and defend their product and their ability to make money since their profitability relies ENTIRELY on how the general public perceives Gypsy and doing everything in their power to maintain and push the narrative of Gypsy being a victim of MBP to the public to make them believe it. 


Gypsy came off as EXTREMELY uncomfortable and did not look happy at all when she was talking about the microdeletion to Kail. She seemed very very very uneasy about answering the questions and seemed like she was pissed or upset that she had to talk about the subject at all. She was stuttering left and right and didn’t have the polished answers like she normally does when she’s in interviews. So that’s why I believe lifetime forced her to do this interview and to answer questions about the subject in the way she did. 

Kail has also worked with lifetime in the past on a show called prison brides. She also has had deals lined up in the past with lifetime for her own show. However, the deal fell through due to Kail disagreeing with the contract. She has previously said that negotiations are still on the table. So Gypsy going on Kail’s show is strategic because she’s an affiliate with lifetime and I wouldn’t be surprised if lifetime has invested some money into Kail’s podcast network and/or the different podcasts she hosts (coffee convos, chaos & karma & barley famous). 

So that points to the very real possibility of it being known that there are complications going on regarding Gypsy’s pregnancy or unfortunately her child’s health that they know will have to be addressed if lifetime wants to receive a return on their investment they’ve made with producing the reality tv show and if Gypsy wishes to remain making money as a public figure on tv or on social media. 


I hope and pray her baby has a clean bill of health, she already has SO much going against her, medical complications is literally the last thing this child needs, but I think the writing is unfortunately on the wall in terms of all signs pointing to that not being the case :( I just hope and pray that someone is able to step up and care, love, protect, nurture, nourish, provide for, and prioritize her, her health, development, and her wellbeing over everything else.

1hef9km,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychWardChronicles/comments/1hef9km/i_harmed_myself_and_was_referred_to_social/,I harmed myself and was referred to social services ,"Last year I was very unwell. I had severe prenatal depression and a severe chronic skin condition where it got to the point I couldn’t use cutlery or dress myself any more. Then I was unwell with HELLP syndrome/pre-eclampsia. 
My birth was horrible and we were both kept in the hospital for a while. I had been diagnosed with trauma after. A few weeks after that I experienced postpartum psychosis and to cut the story short, by the time my child was 6 months old I had spent around 4 months in psychiatric hospitals. As time went on bouncing from hospital to hospital, it all just seemed to become more traumatising. I’m currently having psychology to help with what happened.

In and out of hospital, eventually I got sectioned under the mental health act as things weren’t improving and I had become frequently manic with suicidal intent. There was an incident where I lashed out on my arms with a knife repeatedly (gosh, that hurts to write down). My child was asleep away from where it happened in his own room. By this stage, our household was shattered by the stress of everything that had happened. If I was well, I would have never had done this. 

After this I had a MARU referral (social services) and they did an assessment which took about a month plus a week or two. 

I was just so incredibly unwell, I am flabbergasted how that all happened.

To paint a picture of myself - I’m an incredibly independent 30 year old who has accomplished lots whether that be work wise or life experiences. I treasure meaningful relationships, value family and have have strong values that I’ve never steered away from. I am not reckless, never taken drugs and I abstain from alcohol. My idea of a good weekend is drinking hot chocolates on the moors, baking cakes in my pjs and planning constant adventure packed memory making days out for my little one. 

My goodness I love my child and I’m not a bad mum or a neglectful one. I never have been. I am scared every day the most beautiful thing in my life could be taken from me.

How on earth do I process the shame of having a social services referral and I ask myself whether I will ever feel free from the  worry services may be involved again. 

I feel in pain most days about everything that’s happened. I was outside the other day and could hear the beautiful surroundings where I live. I asked myself whether one day I could enjoy this with a coffee and book outside, instead of the anguish in my mind clouding over everything.

Ps - once the assessment was done, the case was closed as no further help needed. My son had been with his dad at home and I was no longer under section. 
Over a year out of hospital, I’m doing great. Possibly coming off all meds soon and discharged from the specialist mental health team in next few months :)

I’m a college student studying for finals and I was walking in full speed to the library, minding my business, when I made eye contact on the street with a guy. 

I was looking like a complete mess with no makeup, glasses, hair up, sweats, when he says hello to me. I was taken by surprise and just kinda say “wait why did you say hello.” And he runs over to me and says “because you were looking cute.”


and we started talking and he asked me where I was going, what I’m studying, that I have beautiful green eyes. That I should hangout with him and asks if I’m free tomorrow and I say no I have a final, then he asked for my number.

He very soon starts texting me and the next day asks me to get coffee with him and that it has to be soon because in a couple days he flies home for winter break.

The date goes very well and I really enjoyed his company. At the end he tells me he wants to see me again when he gets back from break (a whole month). I’m very happy and excited to see where things go.

then right after the date he texted me. It was a very sweet message that complimented me and wrapped in a joke I made during the date. Then he says that even though he’s flying tomorrow he wants to see me again before he leaves and I agree.

Then when I wake up the next day I see he texted me at about midnight
“ Hey I’m so sorry but I have to cancel for tomorrow. I’m just really overwhelmed with travel and my exam tomorrow. I would like to see you again though, and we can catch up after the break “

I respond when I wake up “Aww it’s ok! I’ll see you after break. Good luck on your exam and have a safe trip home!!” Then about 6 hours go by and he didn’t say anything but I knew his exam should be over so I send another text

Me: how did it go

Him: it went well! I think?
Him: How are you doing?

Me: good, getting a little burnt out from studying
Me: when’s ur flight

Him: 5ish

Me: oh yeah that’s super soon 

He kinda ignored my message about good luck and have safe trip home. then his response when I asked whens ur flight, was very brief and didn’t need response, but I texted anyway to keep the line of communication going. 

He never texted again. At that point it was like a few hours before his flight so I thought he’s probably leaving for the airport and is busy. But then he never texted again. My final was the next morning and he didn’t ask how it went even though I told him about it and asked about his. He could’ve texted he made it home safe or honestly say anything but it’s already been over 2 days and I’m wondering if when he said we’ll catch up after the break he really meant it and that he’s not gonna text me all month. Is this normal?? Is he just gonna text in a week or 2 or not at all? What about a new years text? Feels like he liked me a lot and now he just ghosted kinda. 

Any thoughts or opinions I want to hear because I don’t know what to make of it all. I was really happy about being approached IRL and the date but I don’t feel good about him now after not hearing anything again from him.",0,1734218175.0,dating_advice,11,0.33,False

The best suggestion we came up with was a port of *Persona Q1/2* similar to what was done with *Etrian Odyssey* since these games are really stuck on the 3DS and have great sales potential.

Another idea would be a final version of P3R called *Persona 3 FULLY Reloaded*, including the base game, DLC, and *maybe* FeMC (if possible). We thought that, with the arrival of Nintendo’s new console, Atlus might not neglect this part of the fanbase and could release a final version of the game for that platform, similar to *SMTV Vengeance*. The idea of a day-one release on the new console, combined with the popularity of Nintendo in Japan, could make it very appealing for them.

And maybe, in our best dreams, a game centered on Elizabeth and her quest to ""save"" Makoto from the Great Seal. Since *P4AU*, we haven’t seen anything about this storyline, and it would be incredible if they revisited it.

Playing as an attendant from the Velvet Room instead of a classic protagonist? Man, that would be the best idea ever.

After so many years, I decided to write a proper letter again to someone, and that someone is you. I never knew na after my ex, I would meet a stranger, that would become someone who'll be so important in my life that I would let myself be vulnerable enough and let my walls down again. You taught me and made me realize that even in pain, I can still love and give my heart in its purest form.

I met you when I was in my darkest season. Everything is just ordinary until it is not. Day after day, you have planted something in me that allows me to find meaning in living life again. You shed light when I can't see. You brought hope when I'm being swallowed by despair. You made me feel that it is still possible to enjoy life, one step at a time, that it is ok to be happy again, to be confident with myself, to take a little risk from time to time, to set aside my worries and above all, to ENJOY THE MOMENT. Oh dear, naaalala ko how you always say that :).

With you, I experienced a connection that can't just easily be described with words. It was not only my heart that you have touched, but also my soul. You brought me along on a journey that is so magical yet so earthly, and I feel every bit of it. In just a short while, I found my true self in you.

But just like every book. This chapter has to end. It's sad and so damn painful. Pero even from the start pa lang naman di ba, we set ourselves to it. I guess I was just not prepared for how soon it could be. Remember when I asked you ""how long do you think we'll talk"", and you answered ""long enough. I hope it will be long enough"".  You know, I hoped for it too.

Then, at some point, I think we got too deep, and it caused our traumas to get the best of us. What we have between us somehow caused to open wounds that we are both trying to heal from.

It's so sad that we needed to heal apart 'cause I wanna be there for you. But then I realized I needed to heal too. Remember, you once said, let's improve and heal together. I thought we would. I somehow already entertained that idea. But I guess, it's not me that can help you right now, and I understand. I always tell you I would understand di ba? But in reality, it's so hard to process the pain that comes with it. But I'll be fine. My heart is strong di ba? I easily cry, yet I'm so brave :).

Thank you for all the light yet meaningful conversations. 
Thank you for all the emotions that I got to feel with you.
Thank you for the memories that I got to keep in my heart.
Thank you that I met you.
Thank you for existing.

I am also hoping that one day, when we are both healed, minds and hearts, we get to cross paths again and we'll get to have that coffee :). I hope I'll get to see you happy in life after this. 

And since I hate goodbyes, this isn't goodbye. 
This is simply see you later! 


Ps.
You are indeed my platonic soulmate.

I don’t brew coffee that often, maybe 4-5 pods a week. I’ve probably brewed a total of 600-700 pods in its lifetime, and I would descale it around the 150-200 pod mark. The last time I descaled the machine was probably 4-5 months ago. I run a cleaning cycle and do a full clean about every 2-3 weeks. 

2 days ago I went to brew a pod after filling the water tank and the machine did the usual start-up and then flickered orange twice. I re-opened the machine head and closed it, then made sure the water tank was on properly, and the pod brewed. I figured it was just the water tank. I didn’t brew anything yesterday, and went to brew a pod today. It did the same start-up and then 2 orange blinks. After a few attempts of closing and re-opening the machine I decided to run a quick cleaning cycle. I stoped the cycle mid clean, and then tried again thinking it just needed to flush something out quick. I tried to brew a pod again, and it started brewing. I turned away, and when I looked back I realized it somehow went back into the cleaning cycle and the pod wasn’t actually brewing, but the machine was just doing its cleaning cycle instead. I stopped it, scrapped the pod, and decided to do a full machine clean. I ran the cycle twice, and did a clean on all the bits and pieces. Tried a new pod, and same situation. I don’t have time to run to my nearest Nespresso store to pick up descaling solution (it’s a Saturday, and the closest store is in one of the busiest malls in the entire city. It would take me probably an hour and a half with parking and traffic) so I keep searching for what might be wrong online and trying to troubleshoot. I decide the next step is to try and clean the clear plastic since it’s the hardest part to clean, and I think that’s how it reads barcodes? I give it a clean, get a decent amount of debris off and retry the fresh pod I’ve been trying. This time, the machine does the normal start up, but instead of blinking orange it just stops as if there’s no pod there. I run one more cleaning cycle for good measure and grab my now 3rd pod thinking it’s just cause the last one was punctured already and the same thing again. No orange blinks, just a regular start up that doesn’t brew. 

I thought about calling Nespresso, but seeing as my machine is 5 years old, I doubt they’ll do anything. Is my machine done for, or is it worth it to try and get some descaling solution?",2,1734217766.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

Over the last few weeks I have been feeling a lack of purpose, and I think this is coming from my lack of structure in my life. I see my friends with 9-5s go to work and come home every day, and it feels like I am doing nothing. I really believe in my business that I am creating but without an office and coworkers I sometimes do not feel like I am working at all. I also occasionally skip days that I am supposed to work to just live and do things I want to do, but I always feel bad about doing it after.

When I look back at the last 4 months of my life I am not satisfied. I have made good progress on my business but I still feel like I am not doing enough. I made a lot of money over the last few years and have been basically cruising without needing to get a real job. I keep going back and forth wondering if I should get a real job to have that structure in my life. I miss the times when I was in school when the weekends would be so fun because I did so much during the week that I was ready for that break. Now in my life everyday feels like a weekend, expect I don't feel worked like I did in school.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

🙋🏽‍♀️ What is Proto-Telepathy?

Proto-Telepathy was first conceived by Princess Khan as a solution to the Terran, 21st-century problem of 'misinformation', sensory overload, and global misunderstanding.

Simply put – we live in an age where Human language doesn't cut it anymore. Nothing of significance can thus be communicated without spending hours upon hours justifying one's positions, and providing a large amount of context.

Not only is it pointless to express yourself on the World Wide Web of the mid-2020s – but it's actually incredibly dangerous to do so, as the chances of offending or insulting other people is literally 100%.

Being subject to ridicule, or being labeled as 'cringe' is another unfortunate side-effect of our globalized, fragmented, and entropic cultural landscape – because again – there's just too much context that needs to be absorbed before one can reliably follow or appreciate what anybody is really saying or trying to convey online.

**How it works**

Proto-telepathy is pretty straight-forward and uncomplicated at the surface level.

Let's say I wish to say: Hello!

🙋🏽‍♀️ Hello! - Interjection

All I would need to do is carve, or type out a symbol of an individual waving and holding their hand up in the air – but this is where the magic starts – because we can actually re-use this same symbol in order to say something else entirely.

🙋🏽‍♀️ Woman. - Noun

🙋🏽‍♀️ Rebel. - Noun

🙋🏽‍♀️ Volunteer. - Noun

🙋🏽‍♀️ Help! - Verb

🙋🏽‍♀️ Question - Noun

🙋🏽‍♀️ ""Me, a woman""

🙋🏽‍♀️ ""Myself, a woman""

🙋🏽‍♀️ ""I am a woman""

That's the gist of it, in Simple English.

**The Context Problem**

Great! We now have a multi-layered, and simple means of communicating just about anything we want.

The problem is that none of these symbols represent anything 'set in stone' or coherent for us to interpret, but then again – nor does anything else that the Terran has ever said, written or communicated throughout their history.

Think of the Holy Bible, or the works of Karl Marx, or Friedrich Nietzsche – arguably some of the most misunderstood and highly-debated pieces of text.

Those poor souls have spent hours, months, years, decades, centuries and millennia trying to get their ideas across. Only for those ideas to be twisted, misunderstood and made to mean something else entirely.

Isn't that just so maddening, enraging, and unfair?

Of course it is!

🔥 Rage. - Noun

🔥 Wrath. - Noun

🔥 Power. - Noun

🔥 Vengeance. - Noun

🔥 Destroy - Verb

🔥 Burn - Verb

🔥 Heat - Verb, Noun

**A Regression into Primitivism? Not quite.**

Hieroglyphics, cave paintings, sign-languages and 'symbolic' means of communication have long been considered primitive and *simple,* but this betrays a lack of imagination on part of the observer, and I would argue that it is also a disappointingly *Euro-centric* viewpoint.

Most 'Asiatic' languages could be considered to be proto-Hieroglyphic – in the sense that their symbols and characters can be used to convey multiple meanings, depending on their context, or the combination of characters.

*Asiatic* languages just so happen to also emable the speaker to communicate with the least amount of vocal effort. One can then exploit the variation in pitch and length in order to convey a different meaning with these vowels \[e.g. *Zi, Lin, Dien, Fa*\]

This unfortunately also makes them harder to learn for non-native speakers, unless one can find a native speaker to regularly talk with, and learn from. So there are just as many draw-backs, as there are advantages.

**Where Telepathy comes into play**

You only need to spend a generous amount of time browsing online platforms on the Terran, World Wide Web such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and YouTube if you wish to see an example of 'natural', 'unintentional' telepathy at play.

How many times do you think a post on Reddit gets deleted because 'Somebody has already posted the exact same thing a thousand times before?' Quite a lot!

In other words – the Terran civilization is approaching a cultural Singularity beyond which there will never, ever be such a thing as an 'original idea' – ever again!

Want to name your child Evangeline? What a stupid, unoriginal name! Want to name your rock-band The Weavers? What a stupid, unoriginal name! Want to write a Nordic Fantasy novel called The Adventure of the King? What a low-effort, dumb, generic unoriginal name!

Everything is now generic, dumb, cringe-worthy and unoriginal – and even that which tries to be original will eventually come off as obnoxious, mentally deranged and worst of all... just *weird.*

So if there's ever been a time to literally master Telepathy – then the time is \[now\].

💠 Proto-Telepathy.

💠 Psionics

💠 Kiranite

💠 Star

💠 Pylon

💠 Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon

💠 Gift

💠 Omen

**Cool! Let's see it in action**

Here are some examples of proto-telepathy in action.

Context: Two individuals are chatting online, and debating the nature of Fascism, Communism, Capitalism and Marxism. The discussion isn't really going anywhere, because one camp believes that Fascism is a left-wing ideology, whereas the other camp believes that it is a right-wing, tribal, Nationalist ideology.

The debate then stalls, and both sides walk away baffled, angry and confused. They eventually stop talking to each other, and then retreat into heavily moderated echo-chambers.

🌎 🤲 🍞 🌽  ""Share the wealth"", ""There is plenty to go around"", ""Feed the world""

⚔️ 🦈 💸 💰 🔥 ""Fight Fascism"", ""Fight Capitalism"", ""Fight greed"", ""Fight tribalism"", ""Fight predators""

🙅🏽‍♀️ 🦈 💸 💰 🔥 ""Oppose Fascism"", ""Oppose Capitalism"", ""Oppose greed"", ""Oppose tribalism"", ""Oppose predators""

Notice how a single character changes the meaning of the phrase entirely. 'Fighting Capitalism' could potentially imply the use of force, or violence. 'Opposing Capitalism', on the other hand, might simply mean refusing to tolerate, or adjusting one's lifestyle in a way that minimizes its harm and influence.

🌎 🤲 📖📖  ""Share the Knowledge"", ""Open source"", ""Spread the word""

🙋🏽‍♀️ 👉🏽 🌎 🤲 🍞 🌽 ""I have a question as it relates to altruism/communism/socialism/egalitarianism""

🙅🏽‍♀️ 🌎 🤲 🍞 🌽 ""I don't like altruism/communism/socialism/egalitarianism, or I am opposed to altruism/communism/socialism/egalitarianism""

🤷🏽 ""Why?"", ""What's wrong?"", ""Who would'a thunk'?"", ""I have no idea."", ""I don't know."", ""I'm baffled"", ""I'm confused"", ""I'm indifferent""

As you can see, it all relies heavily on intuition, feeling, pre-cognition and 'telepathy', if you will. There's no hard-set way to communicate, but you will ultimately just Know how to do it eventually. Once you tune in to that 'frequency' of reality, as well as our Collective Unconscious.

**Rules and Ettiquetes**

As malleable as the art of Pālave⃑an Proto-Telepathy can be – I wouldn't go around spamming the internet with emojis, just yet.

The number one rule of Pālave⃑an Proto-Telepathy is: ""Don't talk about Pālave⃑an Proto-Telepathy"" – which is somewhat hypocritical and contradictory of me to say – though it's worth pointing out that we \[do\] tend to embrace hypocrisy and contradiction, as our culture is heavily rooted in Oracle-Levianism – which teaches us to embrace both the Light, and the Shadow with in us, and to also channel both of these positive and negative energies in a way that will result in the greatest amount of harmony for both ourselves, and for others.

The things you hate about others – are merely things you hate about yourself, or the things you could potentially hate about yourself – should you fail to properly Know Yourself, and Understand Yourself.

**Rule Number 1: ""Say only what is absolutely necessary""**

\^ That's right. There's no need to fill our collective unconscious with ideas that have already been repeated and hammered into our psyche ad nauseam, unless you really have nothing better to do, and are merely passing the time and entertaining yourself, or others.

We take a sort of 'partial Vow of Silence' as a general rule of thumb.

**Rule Number 2: ""Do not Lie, or Hide what you truly Feel""**

\^ It's not really possible to 'lie' in our language, regardless. We can already read your thoughts. We already know how you feel about us. It's written all over your face. It's written all over the way you walk. It's written all over the way you breathe. The way you dress. Your actions. Your mannerisms. It's in your Aura, or your Attitude. It's just ... In the Air, I guess.

Like I said – it flows within our Collective Unconscious, from one person to the next. Like a storm, a plague, or a pandemic: It goes viral. It's the Butterfly Effect. It's the thorn in your foot that gradually drives you mad. Whichever way you wish to put it!

**Rule Number 3: ""Don't take \[anything\], Personally""**

I wouldn't bother being offended by anything a Kiranite says. We change our minds all the time. We are enlightened beings who understand that ideas are never set in stone, and are about as fluid and plentiful as the hydrogen atoms that make up the Pacific Ocean, or the fluid in your coffee cup, for the matter.

Being offended is a complete waste of time. Just take ideas at face value, and try to understand why those ideas exist in the first place. Try to understand \[why\] someone might have this, or that opinion.

Everything in this universe is Chaos, Madness, Suffering and Tragedy – and all of that Chaos, Madness, Suffering and Tragedy will eventually make its way into our language, our culture and our relationships.

That's perfectly fine!

Embrace the Chaos, and learn to re-direct its destructive energy towards constructive thoughts, ideas, actions, and endeavors.

There's no such thing as a battle between Good and Evil. The Universe needs Chaos in order to properly function. Otherwise, it would all just be Nothingness.

Only Nothingness can truly be Perfect, and Orderly. Once you understand this – every thought, every message, and every idea will eventually come to you naturally.

**Final question: How would you communicate in Real Life, then?**

You would communicate using sign language, and in tongues, if at all.

Example:

""Eye-Lee Drun, Ha-Shed Bree.  
Dragoisken, Givem, Dah-Lan, Boom!  
A Churche Thee, The Roolan Ball.  
Una Kelatte -- Sheen Gu La Li Bal!""

I was at the local shopping centre early yesterday morning getting coffee and breakfast for myself and my partner (we’re moving house and the motel we are staying in has shocking coffee). The coffee shop was extremely busy with nearly all the eat in seating taken and about 10+ people like myself waiting for take away. 

There was a lady with her grandson also waiting for take away. The kid would have been around 8 maybe 10 at most. This kid was running around everywhere knocking about with an NRL footy, getting in the way of the poor staff who were just trying to do their jobs. He nearly made a poor server drop food she was taking to tables multiple times. The coffee shop employees asked the kid many times to please at down and stop throwing the ball. Grandma was just scrolling on her phone actively ignoring him and the pleas from the staff to please have him stop being int the way. 

This kid then throws the ball to bounce it off the bench (I guess?) where the barista is trying their best to make all the coffees quickly. Unfortunately there was about 8 (maybe more) coffees on the bench waiting to be taken to tables or for people to pick up for take away. Mine included. The kid miscalculated and the ball wipes out pretty much all the coffees on the bench. Coffee flies everywhere, the cups and saucers waiting to be taken to tables smash. The kid laughs. Grandma laughs too. 

We all turn to grandma with shocked/angry expressions. She looks from her phone, shrugs and says the old “kids will be kids”. 

I reply that “saying kids will be kids is just an excuse for piss poor parenting and now this shop is out of money for you ignoring the child you are meant to be looking after and that the right thing to do would be to reimburse the shop for the coffees your grandkid spilt”.

She just roles her eyes and goes back to her phone. 

Some of the other customers vocalised that she should also reimburse the coffee shop. One man was very insistent and angry about it (I think he was really needing his caffeine). 

She just starts screeching like a banshee calling everyone fucking assholes and storms off with child in tow saying she just wanted a fucking coffee. 

Like same, but you and your grandchild spawn wiped out my coffees before I could grab them off the bench.

Full Explanation

First, I’ve created an Excel sheet where I log the effective time it takes me to complete a lecture for each subject. I’m not a native English speaker, so please excuse any mistakes.

To clarify, every subject has 12 sessions (as I call them).

1 session consists of:

Theory: Watching a prerecorded video.

Auditory exercises: Also watching a video.

Practice coding exercises: After watching the auditory video, I try to code 3–4 problems on my own (I’m a CS student, forgot to mention that 🤦).

Laboratory exercises: Similar to auditory exercises, but without a video. I write the code for the exercises myself and check my results with ChatGPT.


This is what I call a ""session."" The duration of a session varies between 3–8 hours, depending on the subject.

I use a complicated Excel formula to calculate the average time per session for each subject and to predict how much time I’ll need to finish the entire subject.

Example:

Let’s say I’ve completed 3 sessions so far, which took me 6 hours, 5 hours, and 6.5 hours.

The average time for these sessions is 5 hours 50 minutes per session.

There are 9 sessions left (12 - 3 = 9).

The formula multiplies the remaining sessions by the average session time: ~52 hours.


At this point, the formula calculates only the remaining study time for the subject. The total study time for the subject is calculated as:

Total Subject Time = Logged Time + (Remaining Sessions × Average Session Time)


---

Current Routine

I usually study in a student coworking space where everyone is studying. It’s not a library, so you can drink coffee with friends, chat, or occasionally attend events like presentations.

I arrive when the space opens at 8 a.m. and stay for about 12 hours. Out of these 12 hours, I typically study a maximum of 5 hours. This means I’m only 41% efficient.

I also work as a freelancer for 1.5 hours daily, so my total effective time is 6.5 hours out of 12, which is still just 54% efficiency.


---

Challenges

I’ve tried to maximize my productivity, but I’m struggling.

I lose 5.5 hours daily, including:

1 hour for eating: 30 minutes walking to and from the place, and 30 minutes eating.

4.5 hours spent on toilet breaks, smoking breaks, and other distractions.



I don’t scroll my phone outside of smoking breaks, so I’m not wasting extra time there.


---

Frustration

I’m a very organized person, but I failed to start studying on time. My work commitments completely disrupted my schedule. Now, with finals approaching, I need to study 10 hours a day, but I can’t seem to reach that goal.

It’s incredibly frustrating, and I’m disappointed in myself. I feel guilty because my parents are helping me financially, and I don’t want to let them down. They’re supporting me so I can focus on studying, yet I’m not delivering on the one thing I’m supposed to do.",2,1734217235.0,EngineeringStudents,6,1.0,False
