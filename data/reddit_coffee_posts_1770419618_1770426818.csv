1qxzz4w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxzz4w,*sniff sniff* what would ur ocs smells like?,"I got inspired by Kei Urana’s post about how they described the smell of each Gachiakuta character so. I wanted a crack at it. This is different than the perfume post I made a while ago, this is more or less what they would acc smell like. 

I know these photos r reused, be nice, im tryna gain my motivation back. Anyway im going by order!

Yelena: she smells… nice. It’s just not noticeable. She smells powdery and slightly floral. She definitely takes some time to spray body spray or some kind of scent to feel presentable.

Corbin: he smells strongly of funeral flowers and incense. Sometimes he also smells like black coffee in the morning. It is unknown if those smells are just lingering from his hobby of visiting random graves or if he’s wearing some kind of cologne. 

Hyunsoo: not for those who cannot handle strong scents. He smells strongly of brand name cologne and cigarettes. I like to think he wears YSL myslf absolu but that’s just me. Many find it to be a headache but Su-ho says it’s comforting. 

Su-ho: hardly has a scent. Mostly just smells like clean laundry. Sometimes she may borrow some of Yelena’s soap so she may have a similar scent. 

Jiahao: He’s a hard worker, he smells like BO and axe body spray (I literally cannot describe it, ifykyk). Sometimes may also smell a bit like booze. Surprisingly doesn’t stink from afar. 

Chloe: she smells NICE and it’s noticeable but not headache worthy. She definitely takes time to make sure she smells good in the morning and it LASTS. I like to think she likes fruity floral scents, think Juicy Couture or Ed Hardy body sprays. 

Haoyu: he doesn’t smell good. He smells strongly of paint, and acrylic paints at that so it’s VERY potent. He also doesn’t take very good care of himself… do what you will with that info. 

Anyway! I’d love to hear yall describe how u think ur ocs would smell like and I’ll reply with if I’d happily sit next to them or if I’d avoid them with a ten foot pole! Have fun! Get creative!",1,1770426753.0,OriginalCharacter,1,1.0,False

1qxzy9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Alone-Broccoli-9153/comments/1qxzy9l/part_three_of_my_story/,part three of my story,"Word about RPA being married to me spread quickly, and it wasn’t long before my reputation preceded me. Apparently, the story of how I handled things with the bat traveled fast—so much so that, according to what I heard, the doorman at that particular strip club actually kept a picture of me by the entrance. It was as if they thought I might storm in at any moment, though, truthfully, I had no intention of ever setting foot in a place like that.

The confrontation with RPA and his companion at our home did not remain a private incident—it quickly sent shockwaves through RPA's social circle, especially among his friends and the staff at the local strip clubs. News of my actions spread rapidly, and soon, my name became synonymous with the story of how I stood my ground that night. Even the employees at the club seemed to be on alert, behaving as if they expected me to storm in at any moment. Despite the rumors and the newly acquired reputation, I was resolute in my decision to avoid any place tied to RPA’s betrayals.

The notoriety that followed was never something I sought out. Instead, it became an unintentional but powerful reminder—to myself and to others—of just how far I was willing to go to protect my dignity and assert my personal boundaries. The story, now a part of local lore, underscored the seriousness of my resolve and the lengths I would take to defend what mine was.

Only a few days had passed since the explosive events at our home when RPA made the choice to return to the same strip club. He seemed determined to act as though nothing had changed, clinging to a sense of normalcy despite everything that had happened. Yet his efforts were quickly thwarted. Less than an hour after leaving, he stormed back into our house, his anger palpable and his voice echoing through the rooms as he hurled accusations at me. He shouted that I had ruined his night, making it clear that he held me responsible for his misfortune. The reason for his fury became apparent: he had been banned from the club, a direct consequence of the reputation I had earned after the confrontation. As he ranted and blamed me for the situation, I met his glare with a calm, knowing smile and simply held his gaze. Inwardly, I recognized that sometimes, life has a way of balancing the scales, delivering its own form of justice whether or not we seek it.

 After RPA began sleeping on the floor in that room, a new and unsettling routine emerged: the phone calls. Jess, ever resourceful and supportive, showed me how to listen in on these conversations. It didn’t take long before we found ourselves staring down a staggering $500 a month phone bills, the result of RPA’s endless hours spent calling women across the country.

These weren’t just casual conversations. Time and again, I overheard him engaging in explicit phone sex—sometimes with the speakerphone on, forcing me to hear every word against my will. The experience was so disturbing that I found myself wishing I could wash my ears out with bleach, desperate to erase what I’d just heard.

One night, Jess and I sat together, listening to yet another call. To my shock and horror, I realized that RPA was speaking with girls who were clearly underage—one admitted to being sixteen, the other just fifteen. Their conversation quickly turned to plans for the girls to come to our home and meet RPA in person. Unable to remain silent, I snatched the phone and put an immediate stop to the situation. I made my position clear: “Oh hell, no. I will not have jailbait in my house. The minute you set foot on my doorstep, the cops will be called, and you’ll be sent back to your parents.”

The fallout from intercepting that troubling phone call was immediate. RPA charged down the stairs, his face contorted with fury, hurling insults and calling me a crazy bitch. Rather than backing down, I met his anger with a calm, defiant smile. “Oops, did I mess that up for you? My bad,” I quipped, refusing to let his rage intimidate me. The tension in the air was punctuated by Jess, who couldn’t help but burst into laughter—so much that she nearly fell out of her chair. RPA, caught off guard and realizing that Jess had witnessed everything, was left speechless. I seized the small victory, bowing dramatically to Jess and blowing a kiss in RPA’s direction—a symbolic gesture of triumph amid the chaos that had unfolded.

A few days later, Jess and I sat together at the dining room table, the silence between us heavy with the aftermath of everything that had recently transpired. She quietly observed me, noticing the tension in my posture as I gripped my glass of soda with both hands. I felt the urge to reach for something stronger to numb the relentless stress, but my medical condition made that impossible now. The risks of alcohol mixing with my medication were too great, so I held on to my resolve, choosing my health over momentary relief.

My mind drifted to the earlier chapters of my life, when coping with hardship often meant seeking refuge in self-destructive habits. In those days, I turned to underage drinking, hoping the numbness would dull the pain that weighed on me. With a large glass of Jack Daniels became my escape whenever I could afford it, while Jim Beam served as a cheaper substitute when money was tight. On the most difficult nights, when there seemed to be no other options, even Mad Dog 20/20 was enough to quiet the turmoil inside.

Yet, as time passed, I came to understand the consequences of those choices. The relief was temporary, and the spiral of self-medicating only compounded the struggle, especially as new health challenges emerged. It was a lesson learned the hard way—that turning to alcohol provided no real solution and inevitably made things worse. Now, faced with the pressures and stress that still arise, I am determined to prioritize my well-being above all else. No matter how strong the urge to escape may be, I choose to protect my health and resist the temptation to fall back into old patterns.

Sensing my unease, Jess leaned in with a look of concern and quietly asked what was troubling me. I exhaled slowly, the weight of exhaustion heavy in my chest, and finally found the words to express what I had been holding inside. “I’m just tired,” I confessed, my voice barely rising above a whisper. I tried to explain the strange comfort that used to come with certainty, no matter how painful the reality. “At least with a beating, I knew when the hit was coming.” My gaze drifted around the room as I gestured helplessly, attempting to capture the overwhelming sense of dread that now permeated my days. “But this—” I said, letting my hand fall to my lap. “This is so much worse.” The unpredictability, the constant anxiety, and the fear of what might happen next felt far more unbearable than any physical pain I had endured before. The uncertainty gnawed at me, leaving me feeling more vulnerable and exposed than ever.

 As Jess and I sat together at the table, I finally found the courage to voice the fear that had been consuming me for days. My hands trembled as I wrapped them around my glass, searching for words that felt nearly impossible to say aloud. With my voice barely above a whisper, I confessed, “I’m terrified to get close to my husband.” The admission made my vulnerability feel raw and exposed, the weight of recent events pressing heavily on my shoulders.

The anxiety gnawing at me was relentless. After everything RPA had done, the betrayals, the secrecy, and the countless nights spent wondering where he truly was, I found myself plagued by an overwhelming sense of dread. The fear that he might have brought home an STD haunted me constantly. It was a possibility I had never anticipated, a consequence I neither asked for nor deserved. The idea of facing such a risk, not because of anything I had done, but solely because of his choices, filled me with a profound sense of injustice and fear. Because of this, I refused to let him touch me at all, determined to protect myself in whatever way I could.

Unable to meet Jess’s eyes, I lowered my gaze, my words faltering. “I know he’s been sleeping with those strippers,” I admitted, each syllable heavy with resignation. Saying it aloud made the reality all the more undeniable. The trust I once had in my marriage had been shattered, replaced by uncertainty and the constant worry of what else might be waiting for me as a result of his actions.

Jess reached across the table and squeezed my hand, offering a small measure of comfort during a moment of vulnerability. Sensing my distress, she attempted to reassure me, her tone gentle as she asked if I was truly certain about what RPA had done. Unable to find the words, I simply raised an eyebrow in response—my silence speaking volumes about what I already knew.

“A man who comes home with his clothes, his skin, everything covered in body glitter and reeking of cheap body spray—there’s only one explanation, Jess. Only one,” I told her, my voice steady despite everything. Jess didn’t argue with me; the understanding in her eyes was clear. She nodded softly and replied with a quiet, “Oh,” acknowledging the painful truth without judgment.

I let out a long sigh, exhaustion washing over me. The truth could no longer be denied. “It all makes sense,” I confessed, the realization settling heavily in my chest. “He leaves the house with at least seven hundred dollars in his wallet and comes home with a hundred and fifty—or less. I know exactly where all that money is going—straight to some woman in stripper heels and a thong.” As the words left my mouth, they seemed to linger in the stillness, the painful reality impossible to ignore. The gap between what I wanted to believe and what I knew had grown too wide to bridge.

That afternoon, a heavy tension settled over the house, almost as if it had taken on a physical form. Suddenly, the sharp bang of the bedroom door slamming shut upstairs echoed through the rooms, a clear signal that trouble was brewing. Not long after, RPA appeared at the bottom of the stairs, his movements sluggish and his look disheveled. He was still wearing his red sweatpants, the ones with ""USMC"" spray-painted in bold, longhand letters down one leg. The fact that he looked as though he had just rolled out of bed—even though it was well past one in the afternoon—made the atmosphere feel even heavier, his disheveled presence adding to the unease that already gripped the house.

RPA’s eyes darted to Jess before settling back on me, signaling that he wanted to speak with me in private. Sensing the tension in the room, Jess responded with quiet understanding. She stood up gently, her movements soft and deliberate, and as she passed, she laid a comforting hand on my shoulder. Leaning in, she whispered for me to call her later—a subtle but meaningful gesture of support. I managed only a nod; my attention locked on the sky-blue placemats spread across the dining room table. My heart raced as I braced myself for whatever was about to come.

Anxiety rose up inside me, tightening my chest with familiar dread as I silently hoped RPA wouldn’t lash out at my face or head. Even as I kept my gaze lowered, I was intensely aware of how close he stood. From the corner of my eye, I tracked his hand as it paused near my head. Slowly, he reached out—not with aggression, but with an unexpected gentleness—and turned my face toward him. Despite his touch, my wary eyes stayed fixed on the off-white carpet beneath the dining room table, conditioned by past experience to avoid making eye contact.

RPA spoke in a soft tone that was unusual for him: “Jean, look at me.” For a brief moment, I glanced up and met his hazel eyes. In that instant, I thought I saw remorse flicker across his face—a rare and fleeting vulnerability. But just as quickly as it appeared, the remorse vanished, replaced by the familiar flash of anger that immediately put me back on edge.

In an instant, RPA's demeanor shifted from defensive to hostile. He snarled at me, making it clear that how he spent his money was none of my concern. He asserted his authority by reminding me that I was his possession, reducing our relationship to the symbolism of the ring on my finger. The message was unmistakable: I had no say in the matter. Then, as if to drive the point home, he forcefully pushed me out of my chair and walked away, leaving me shaken and vulnerable on the floor.

That night marked a turning point. Fearful of what might happen next, I stopped sleeping in our bedroom. Instead, I moved downstairs to the couch, always keeping a bat within arm’s reach—either tucked under the couch or resting on our green coffee table. Sleep became elusive; I remained vigilant, never fully letting my guard down. If I heard RPA coming downstairs, I would quickly escape to the bathroom and lock the door, waiting until he returned upstairs before emerging.

By the fourth day, the relentless anxiety and lack of rest finally caught up with me, and exhaustion overcame my defenses. I drifted into a deep sleep, only to wake the next morning in our bed with RPA’s arms wrapped tightly around me. He apologized, his voice soft as he said, “Hon, I’m so sorry I scared you. I love you so much.” Despite his words, I could only make myself go stiff, turning to look at my side of the bed. I wished for a normal mattress instead of the waterbed mattress with high frame and its dark red bumper pads, and longed to slip free from his iron grip, desperate for distance and safety.

The fragile peace between us lasted only about a month. During that time, I found myself having to accompany RPA everywhere he went, even when I desperately wanted to be alone. On one particular day, as we drove down the road in his Trans-Am, he reached across the center console, took my hand in his, and pressed a kiss to the back of it. As he did, he whispered that he loved me. He explained that his cold, distant exterior came from his experiences in the USMC, as if that justified everything.

That day, I learned the real reason he wanted me with him. We drove down I-25 and pulled into the parking lot near PetSmart, where a new store had just opened—a gun store. When we parked, I turned to look at him, searching his face for any hint of his intentions. RPA just smiled and said, “Come on, sweetheart, we need a few of them in the house. You know I’m from Texas—it’s good to have a couple around.” The only thought running through my mind was that we lived in the middle of Colorado Springs, Colorado, a city with plenty of police and, undoubtedly, plenty of guns already.

He took my hand and held the door open for me as we walked inside. RPA picked out a shotgun first, then led me over to where the handguns were displayed. Standing there, a chill ran through me—despite it being a warm June day, it felt as if I were standing on the side of Pikes Peak, buried in an eight-foot snowdrift wearing nothing but a bikini and socks. The sensation was so strong it was as if a rabbit had just run over my grave.

After browsing for a while, RPA selected a 9mm Glock. I can still picture that gun: black, with a hint of dark blue shining under the store lights. As the clerk worked on the paperwork, a sense of dread settled over me. My first thought was, “F@ck, I’m going to die.” When the salesclerk finally placed the Glock back in its box, I looked up and caught his eye. In that glance, I saw everything—an unspoken apology, a silent acknowledgment of my fear.

In the days following our unsettling trip to the gun store, I found myself unable to recover emotionally. The tension lingered, never giving me a moment to breathe. Within a week, RPA had disappeared again. There was more that strip club in Colorado Springs at the time, and since RPA was banned from one, I asked Jess to follow him. She called me from a pay phone and confirmed my suspicions—RPA was at another club, this one closer to Fort Carson.

Hearing the familiar roar of the Trans-Am as it pulled into our parking lot sent my nerves into overdrive. I couldn’t take it anymore. I moved quickly to the bottom of the stairs and opened the front door just as RPA entered through the glass screen door. He looked at me with a strange expression, then sat down heavily on the couch. Without warning, he turned to me and demanded, “What the f@ck is your problem now?”

The tension in the house had reached a breaking point. The Glock, no longer hidden away in the downstairs closet, now sat out in the open on the coffee table, its presence impossible to ignore and deeply unsettling. I felt utterly depleted; every ounce of energy drained from my body. And  I sat down in the middle of the staircase with a heavy weight, the weight of everything pressing down on my shoulders. Slowly, I gripped two of the staircase posts, more for emotional support than physical stability, and took a shaky breath and looked at RPA throw the wooden vertical spindles of the staircase. My voice came out small and tired as I finally spoke: “I’m tired, R,” I said quietly. “I can’t do this anymore. In the morning, please drop me off at the homeless shelter. You win.”

RPA remained seated on the couch, his gaze fixed on me with an intensity that was both unsettling and unyielding. It was as if my words had landed a physical blow—his face drained of color, the shock evident in his features. That pale expression quickly shifted, and his complexion transformed, flushed with pure, unmistakable rage. In a chilling response to the emotional confrontation, RPA reached over and picked up the Glock, his actions underscoring the volatility of the moment. RPA's demeanor shifted abruptly as he pointed the gun at me, his eyes narrowed with anger. His voice was sharp and accusatory as he snarled, “What the f@ck did you say to me?” The sudden outburst shattered whatever fragile calm had existed, amplifying the tension in the room. The intensity of his reaction left me feeling cornered and vulnerable, uncertain of what might happen next.

RPA fixed me with a hard stare and declared, “You are mine.” The words echoed with chilling finality, reinforcing the sense of ownership he held over me. I remained rooted to the spot, paralyzed by fear, convinced that any movement—no matter how slight—could have provoked RPA to unpredictable violence. The possibility that he might shoot me, perhaps even just for his own twisted amusement, kept me utterly still. In that moment, the threat was palpable, and my only instinct was to avoid drawing his attention further.

The tense standoff between us was finally interrupted when RPA let out a chilling, evil laugh. He locked eyes with me, his expression filled with menace, and made it explicitly clear that I would not be allowed to leave him—at least, not until he decided it was acceptable. His words were firm and controlling, reinforcing the sense of entrapment that had come to define our relationship. In that moment, any hope I had of escaping was crushed under the weight of his authority and the unmistakable message that my freedom depended solely on his permission.

As the shock wore off overwhelmed by terror, I rushed upstairs and immediately locked the bedroom door. Determined to create a barrier between myself and any potential threat, I barricaded both entrances: one that led to the bathroom and the other to the upstairs landing of our townhouse. The only time I dared to unlock either door was when Missy, my cat, meowed insistently to come inside. I opened the door , I let her in, grateful for the comfort of her company. I slept on the floor, positioning of the waterbed between myself and the barricaded doors, hoping it would offer some sense of protection.

That night, sleep eluded me entirely. Paralyzed by fear, I lay on the floor next to Missy, my heart pounding with every sound that echoed through the house. Each creak and footstep sent my thoughts racing, convinced that RPA was coming upstairs to continue what he had begun earlier that evening. The anxiety was relentless, and I remained on high alert, unable to let my guard down for even a moment.

The next morning, I moved through the house with extreme caution, each step down the stairs feeling as if I were walking on eggshells. My only goal was to avoid waking RPA, who was passed out on the couch. With every careful movement, my mind churned with escape plans—desperately searching for a way out of the townhouse and onto a bus that would take me downtown to the homeless shelter. Each obstacle intensified my anxiety: I realized I needed money for the fare, but using my bank card was out of the question. RPA could easily track any transaction, and the bus stop across from our bank provided a direct route downtown, raising the risk of being seen or intercepted. I mentally mapped out possible hiding places if things went wrong, and though the thought of calling my sister for help crossed my mind, the overwhelming anxiety made that option seem impossible.

My wallet—a small, black and silver lifeline—sat just a few feet away from me. Reaching it felt as daunting as crossing a deep ravine without a bridge. I crept quietly across the living room, inching toward the wallet and the hope of freedom it symbolized. Halfway there, I stopped and glanced back, needing to be sure RPA was still asleep. But I was horribly mistaken. His hazel eyes were open, watching me. In that instant, my hope vanished. The wallet, my only means of escape, now seemed impossibly out of reach. Before I could react, RPA rose from the couch.

He closed the distance between us in three long strides, his imposing presence magnified by the physical disparity between us. Standing at just 5'5"", I was completely overshadowed by his six-foot frame and solid build. The difference in our sizes was undeniable, and as he towered over me, the reality of my situation became unmistakably clear—I was utterly trapped.

The memory of that moment still lingers painfully, a dull throb pulsing at the back of my head each time I recall it. I remember the exact instant RPA woke up; there was no warning before he was upon me. In one swift, overpowering movement, he pinned me tightly against the closed downstairs bathroom door. His hand—so much larger than mine—easily seized both of my wrists, forcing my arms above my head and holding them there with an iron grip. The weight of his body pressed into me, rendering any attempt at escape impossible. Leaning down so that his mouth was close to my ear, RPA whispered in a cold, mocking tone, “Where are you going, sweetheart?” The menace behind his words was unmistakable, and the sense of helplessness in that moment remains vivid and raw.

With his free hand, RPA slid his fingers up my shirt, rubbing my chest as he whispered in a low purr, “Come, love. I have missed you so much. I just want to make love to you again and prove that my love for you is real.” His touch was invasive, and his words rang hollow given the tension and fear that filled the house.

RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my life.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my l.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle gesture, but a harsh act. He refused a kiss on the cheek, instead forcing my mouth open and pressing his lips to mine in a French kiss I did not want.

Instinct took over as I tried to defend myself, aiming my knee toward RPA's groin in a desperate attempt to break free. But he was quick; he anticipated my move and blocked it by positioning his own knee between my legs. My effort at resistance failed, heightening my sense of helplessness and leaving me feeling even more powerless in the moment.

As the tension mounted, it was as if my silent plea for rescue was answered by the sharp beeping of RPA's pager echoing from the coffee table. The interruption was sudden, providing a brief window of relief. RPA released his grip, and I slid down against the door, my body trembling from both exhaustion and the overwhelming sense of relief.

RPA walked over to the coffee table, picked up the pager, and studied the number displayed. He sighed in frustration and muttered that he needed to take the call. Before leaving, he grabbed my wallet and keys, ensuring I could not escape while he was gone. Then, with determination, he headed for the front door. The familiar roar of the Trans-Am filled the air as he started the engine, pulled out of his parking spot, and sped away, leaving me shaken but alone.

Alone at last, I crawled into the downstairs bathroom, overwhelmed by a wave of nausea that soon overtook me. After vomiting, I ran upstairs, desperate to rid myself of the lingering taste and sensation. I brushed my teeth—once, then again—trying to reclaim a small measure of control and comfort.

Chaos everywhere.
Kim is pacing, arguing on her phone.

KIM
“I’m DONE this time. I mean it. I’m emotionally finished—”
She pauses, texts.

KIM (CONT’D)
“—unless he apologizes correctly.”

JOSH
On the couch. Vape pen. Phone in hand. Scrolling.
Does not look up. Ever.

ENTER: LILY (5)
Josh’s daughter. Bright-eyed. Energetic. Talking already.

LILY
“Hi Papa. Did you know sharks don’t sleep like people but they still rest? I had cereal AND a banana and Daddy forgot to brush his teeth again.”
Josh nods without looking up.

JOSH
“Uh-huh.”
STEPDAD (V.O., DEADPAN)
“And here we see the only functioning adult in the room.
She’s five.”
Lily climbs onto a chair, surveying the chaos.

LILY
“Why is Aunt meme yelling?”
KIM (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
“Because MEN—”
Lily cuts her off.

LILY
“Oh. That makes sense. Daddy does that too.”
Josh scrolls. Vape puff.
Mom rushes in with snacks.

MOM
“Who wants juice?!”

LILY
“I already had juice. It was apple. It was okay but orange is better. Also Daddy said we were leaving but we didn’t so that was confusing.”
Mom freezes.

MOM
“…Josh?”
Josh finally looks up.

JOSH
“Plans changed.”
Lily hops down, stands directly in front of Josh, hands on hips.

LILY
“Daddy.”
Josh pauses scrolling.

JOSH
“Yeah?”

LILY
“You said we were going to the park. And when people say things they should mean them or else other people get sad. That’s called responsibility.”
Silence.
Kim slowly lowers her phone.
Mom stares.
Josh blinks.

STEPDAD (V.O.)
“She learned that in kindergarten.
The rest of us are still working on it.”
Josh nods solemnly.

JOSH
“Okay. Park. In ten minutes.”
Lily squints.

LILY
“Ten real minutes or Daddy minutes?”
Josh exhales.

JOSH
“Real minutes.”
Kim suddenly turns to Lily.

KIM
“Do you think I should leave him?”
Lily tilts her head, considers deeply.

LILY
“Well… do you like him more than you hate him?”
Kim opens her mouth.
Closes it.

KIM
“…I don’t know.”

LILY
“Then maybe don’t yell until you know.”
Beat.
Josh goes back to scrolling.
Mom wipes a tear.

1qxzpos,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qxzpos/the_targeted_ads_on_my_phone_are_getting_really/,The targeted ads on my phone are getting really weird.,"So, I bought a new phone recently and they had a new ad-supported plan. Basically, I’d pay less each month, but I would occasionally get ads that take over the screen. The salesman said it wouldn’t interrupt calls or alarms and I’d still have the ability to call emergency services. The ads used face ID and I would need to look at the screen for ten seconds to dismiss them.



I decided to go for it, it cut my monthly bill nearly in half. They didn’t push the ads too often. Hell, I didn’t even get one until I had already been using the device a week. I logged on to check twitter, yes I still call it twitter, and my screen went grey. Then a message popped up at the top saying \*McDonald’s Ad\*. That was it. Until I looked at it. The screen played a video of a big mac on a plate, the camera slowly circling. After ten seconds of looking at it, the ad snapped off and I was back to twitter. The ad worked, though; I was pretty hungry so I ordered a McDonald’s.



They'd always start that same way. Grey screen. Line announcing what company the ad was for. Ad started when I had been looking at the screen for a second or two. It was weird, I admit. But the ads were infrequent, the phone was good; I was happy.



Then, after about a month, my phone pinged as if I’d got a message.



*Would you like to opt-in for targeted ads?* It said. Below were two buttons for me to press: *yes please!* And *No, keep them generic*. I sighed and stared at the options for a moment. I did hate getting random ads, the day before I'd received one for menstrual cups and every third seemed to be a gambling ad. But the notion of rubber stamping their desire to sift through my information and habits left a bad taste in my mouth.



So, I clicked *No, keep them generic*. At which point a further message popped up.



*Are you sure?* And below that *Yes, I want to opt in*, and *No, I’ve changed my mind*. There was no right answer. I swore under my breath; new phone and it already had a bug. I clicked one of the options and accepted the targeted ads because until I did the thing was a glorified paper weight. 



*Congratulations, from now on we will target ads just for you, Brian*. 



I didn’t like that. Sure, I was signed in and logically it had my name but nope. Nuh-uh. I was getting the thing fixed or returned or something. 



I brought it up to my roommate, Eric, because he was good with technology. Better than me at least. He just laughed, his massive frame jiggling. 



“Oh yeah, they probably own your soul now! Gonna snatch you in your sleep to human centipede you.” He said.



“Dude, I’m serious. It’s weird. How do I fix it?” 



“You’re such a pussy, fine give it here.” He extended a meaty paw. I slipped my phone from my pocket and was about to pass it to him when it pinged. I stared at the message that enveloped the screen.



*Federal-ad 4040: He is not your roommate; do not trust him*.



I froze, staring at the screen. Trying to process the message. 



“What is it?” Eric leant forward to try and see my phone. The ad was gone, but I quickly stuffed it back in my pocket anyway. 



“Nothing. Work thing.” I tried. “They need me to come in.”



“Bummer. Want me to check your phone out first?”



“What? Oh, no. No, I gotta run.”



“Cool beans, bud. I’ll take a look at your phone when you get back.” Eric said. I moved past him and out of our apartment. I kept my pace steady down the dingy hallway before tearing down the stairs. Why was he so fixed on getting my phone? Cool air outside hit me like a truck and I took deep breaths that needled at my throat.  



Paranoia. That’s all it was. Paranoia and poor timing. No doubt I’d received an ad for some new show coming to Netflix or Apple that just happened to seem relevant. Eric wasn’t acting any different to usual. I shook my head at what an idiot I’d just made of myself. I turned to go back inside, but hesitated. What if I was wrong? 



I was being silly. Logically, I knew I was. Still, I clearly needed to be away from my apartment for a while. I ducked into the nearest coffee shop to escape the cold and warm myself back up. The staff were an ever-changing supply of college students working while they studied with only the manager remaining somewhat consistent. The girl who took my order was new to me. She had both sides of her bottom lip pierced and wore dark makeup. 



“Heya! Welcome to *Roast and Grind*, what can I getya?” Her voice was so chipper it seemed at odds with her appearance. Her smile was wide and warm, perfect teeth proudly displayed.



“Coffee, please. Black coffee.” I mumbled. I focused on the cookies and cakes displayed at the counter, worried I looked paranoid.



“One americano coming up, what size would you like?”



“Medium.”



“Okey. Anything else today, sir?” She asked; I shook my head. I used my phone to pay. The barista said something else, but I wasn’t listening. A new ad had appeared on my phone. 



*Federal-ad 6661: You live alone*. 



My mouth went dry. The ad vanished and I stuffed my phone back in my pocket. It had to be coincidental. It had to. That thought was the only thing keeping me going at that point. The alternative, the truth, was unthinkable. 



I grabbed my coffee when it was ready and slunk into a seat in the corner, away from the few other customers currently around. I needed a wall behind me. I felt watched. 



If you suffer from anxiety, then your doctor will likely tell you to reduce your caffeine intake. It increases the heart rate and can exacerbate symptoms. At least, that’s what my doctor told me. But I’ve always found coffee soothing. The bitter aroma, the slight acidity. It calms me. It feels like a pleasant warmth spreading through my body and the dense writhing ball of worries in my head slows and lightens. Other patrons buzzed about in ones and twos, eating, drinking, coming, going. All while I sat and slowly sipped my coffee. 



It was several hours later that I finally returned to my apartment to find it empty. I figured Eric had gone to work or something and laughed at myself for being such a nut. 



I didn’t get any more ads the rest of the day. The day after, I got one for Starbucks while I was getting ready for work. No doubt based on the amount of time I’d spent sat in a coffee shop. I resolved to take the phone in for repair after work. I was still twitchy about giving it to Eric, couldn’t get those ads out of my mind. Besides, there was no guarantee he could fix it, but the nerd hub or geek club or whatever would get it sorted. 



The office was quiet. We were still doing that hybrid working that meant you only had to be in 3 days a week. Tracey and Bevin were in attendance, having a heated argument about the ending of some TV show. 



“Morning!” I called to them.



“Hey.” Tracey said. Bevin managed a wave in my general direction, not breaking the flow of his current diatribe. It was normal, exactly what I needed after the weird panic I’d worked myself into the day before. I spent most of the time filling in reports, fixing a spreadsheet that someone had butchered since I’d last used it, and logging my hours with various clients. At lunch, I grabbed a tuna melt from the food van that parked by the office and sat in the cubby canteen rather than the main canteen. It was a small room that was probably meant for meetings, but no one used it so our team had seized control and stuck a minifridge and snack bar in there. 



Bevin virtually threw himself into the seat opposite me, flicking his hair from his eyes. 



“Tell me you’ve seen it?” He asked, punctuating the question by ripping the film off his own sandwich. 



“Seen what?” I could only assume he wanted to launch into the same rant he’d subjected Tracey to that morning. Before he answered, my phone buzzed. 



*Federal-ad 1343^1343: The recursions exist to stabilise the recursions exist to stabilise...*



The message filled the screen and began scrolling before it winked out. Bevin was staring at me. Clearly I’d missed the name of whatever show he was talking about.



“Have you heard of a show called Federal?” I asked. I figured he was up with popular shows and that was probably the name given how other ads had displayed. Bevin looked annoyed for a moment, before his desire to be the source of media knowledge won out and he started thinking. 



“Mmm, no. What’s it about?” 



“I, well I dunno. Just keep getting ads for it on my phone.” I said.



“Show me, show me, show me. I need something new to binge.” He shuffled his chair around next to me so he could see my phone. It was blank. I explained about the ad contract I had. 



“That’s wild. I know they did something like that for Pluribus, so its probably Amazon or something scrambling to catch up. I’mma def look it up.” 



The day ended, Bevin and Tracey both packed up and left, and I sat at my computer, something niggling at the back of my mind I couldn’t quite place. I finished up the report I was doing and finally shut my pc down. Just had to check and make sure the phone place was still open and I hadn’t missed it by not going at lunch. Before I got a chance my phone rang. Mom displayed on the screen. 



“Hey, mom. Sorry, was I supposed to call?” 



“No, no. I was just reminiscing. I was in your old room today, dusting. Your father says I need to leave the dust be, it isn’t worth my back!” She said. I smiled. They’d turned my old room into a spare bedroom, mostly the same furniture just no longer decorated for a 16 year old boy. 



“Anyway, I was moving things around to dust and I found an old polaroid on the shelf! It’s a picture of Maxie and I thought you might want it.” 



Maxie was my first dog. Well, she was my parents’ dog. They’d had her two years when I was born and the stubborn mutt stayed with me until I was 15. It was pretty good going for the beagle-terrier-retriever that she was. She’d adored me and seemed to think I was her puppy. 



“Yeah, that’d be really nice. I’ll swing by this weekend” I said. I could feel my eyes well up as I remembered her. My parents had had dogs since then, but they weren’t Maxie. 



“Ok honey. You be safe. I love you.”



“Love you too, mom.” I hung up and was content to let my mind drift to thoughts of Maxie when an ad popped on my phone. 



*Federal-ad 3991: Do you remember your mother’s voice? Are you certain that was her?*



I dropped my phone. It clattered loudly against my desk before tumbling to lie on the floor. I took deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Stomach breaths, like my therapist had suggested. Coincidence, that’s all it was. My heart slowly steadied and I felt calmer, but I continued the breathing exercise to settle myself. 



I still had a hint of trepidation when I picked up the innocuous device that was causing me such attacks. I checked that it still worked and that it didn’t have another unpleasant advertisement for me. It showed my normal lock screen; Starry Night. Peaceful. I tucked the phone into my inside pocket and packed up my things. 



I decided to go straight home and curl up away from everyone for the night. The phone could be dealt with tomorrow. Poppy synth music floated down the hall from my apartment and I slipped in to find Eric splayed on the recliner watching some weird show. 



“Hey.” He said, obviously hearing the door because he didn’t turn from the tv. “Ordered pizza.”



“Cool. Thanks, man. Let me know the damage, I’m gonna lie down.” I said; he gave me a thumbs up, still engrossed in his show. He never asked for, or accepted, any money for the pizzas. I must’ve owed him a fortune. 



I kept the lights off in my room and put on some white noise. It was all so stupid getting worked up over some ads on my phone. I lay down on my lumpy mattress and closed my eyes. I focused on the white noise. At some point, I fell asleep. 



I was stood in a server room. Or what movies have taught me was a server room. Racks of grey computers sprawled endlessly in a white room bathed in blue light. I took a step and the sound echoed all around me. I waited for the responding sound of pursuit. Nothing. 



I moved around the technological labyrinth ever mindful in case a mechanical minotaur awaited me. The tiled floor beneath me became metal grating. Blue light reflected in the dark pool of water revealed beneath the grates. 



A red light’s flickering reflection guided me forward to the heart. A laptop, old and boxy, sat on a tray, a bright yellow cable dangled from it to the floor. The red light came from the nearby server, next to a port that matched the connector on the cable. Instinctively, I grabbed the cable and reconnected it. The laptop beeped happily. 



Then a current surged up through my feet and raced along my body. I lost control of my legs and should have toppled, but the electricity kept my muscles in place. The sensation vibrated through me, accelerated. My arms cramped and curled on the verge of tearing free. I could feel my heart. Feel it quivering. My vision fuzzed at the edges. The laptop beeped and before my eyes burst, I just managed to make out the text that appeared.



*Federal-ad 8065: The dreams can be fatal*.



My eyes burst open and I sat up in bed gasping. My phone was beeping and when I looked at it the same message from my dream was displayed. My heart struggled to regain composure after the dream. I went to stand but an intense pain stabbed at my feet. Peeling off my socks revealed red welts on the soles of my feet arranged in a grid. Gingerly, I touched one of the welts, not entirely believing the evidence of my eyes. The lightest touch sent a shock racing along the lines. 



A knock at my door drew me away from the whirlpool my thoughts were drowning in. Eric opened my door a moment later proffering a pizza box like it was a holy relic.



“I bring pizza!” He declared. “What the fuck happened to your foot?” 



“I...don’t know.” 



“Shit, man, looks like you jumped onto a steam vent. Put some neosporin on it, don’t wanna catch an infection.” He handed me my pizza and left before returning a minute later to toss a tube of neosporin+ onto my bed. 



“Thanks, Eric. I’m having the weirdest week.” I said, reaching for the ointment. He gave me an understanding nod and closed my door. I decided to eat my pizza before applying the ointment because there was no way I’d make it to the bathroom to wash my hands and I didn’t want neosporin pizza. 



The next day the lines were faded and, while tender, I could place my weight on them. After a sleepless night of speculation, I still wasn’t sure if the ad had saved my life, or been the thing trying to kill me. Either way, I decided to leave my phone at home and head to work without it. 



It was just me, Tracey and Bevin in the office again. They seemed to be rehashing the same argument as yesterday so I left them to it and moved to my desk. Irritatingly, there had been some technical issue and I had to replicate a lot of the work I’d done the day before. Not before spending an hour in a tedious call with IT, however, which culminated in them informing me they couldn’t recover any of it. 



I was relieved when lunch finally came around and I could grab a sandwich from the truck. I had barely sat down when Bevin swept into the seat opposite me. He flicked his head to move the hair from his eyes. 



Tell me you’ve seen it?” He said as he tore open his sandwich. The words gave me an odd feeling, tickling a memory. My phone pinged and I pulled it out of my pocket. It was an ad.



*Federal-ad 1343^1343: The recursions exist to stabilise the recursions exist to stabilise...*



The sentence went on and on and on, scrolling up my screen. I dropped my phone like it was on fire and darted away from the table. 



“Whoa, jeez Bry-guy, you ok there?” Bevin asked. He had paused mid-bite to follow the trajectory of the phone as it bounced off the table and sailed onto the floor. I didn’t reply. Just took a wide circle around the device and darted out the door. 



I had left my phone in my room. I remembered leaving it. But there it was in my pocket. The same message as yesterday...only then did I realise it was all the same. Everything at the office was the same. 



I didn’t return to my desk, I left the building as fast as I could. I got in my car and drove. I considered my apartment, but it didn’t feel safe. I needed to feel safe. I went Home.



Mom's eyes lit up when she opened the door and saw me standing on her porch. She positively fell forward and smothered me in a hug. 



“Oh, sweetheart! We weren’t expecting you until tomorrow. Haven’t anything in to feed you now.” She sniffled, finally letting me go. 



“It's fine, mom. Just needed to get away and clear my head.” Inside, dad sat on his chair by the fire, squinting through his glasses at the day’s paper. He looked up as I stepped in.



“Who let that one in?” He jested.



“Nice to see you too, dad.” I dropped onto the couch. It’s almost supernatural the way you can slip back into an earlier part of your life. I’d moved out 15 years ago and didn’t see my folks anywhere close to enough. Yet we all sat in the front room with some gameshow playing on the TV and it was like I’d never left. Mom and I talked about aunt Judy's affair, or cousin Derek’s latest get-rich-quick scheme. All the while dad offered the occasional humorous remark as he attempted to read his paper. 



It must have been at least an hour later when mom’s phone rang. 



“Yes, hello?” She answered. “He’s actually here with me, did you want to speak to him?” Her eyes flicked to me and I groaned. I shook my head frantically, but mom held out the phone. 



“Hello.” I said, having reluctantly accepted the phone. There was no reply. “Hello?” I tried again. I looked at the screen, the call had disconnected. Then the screen went grey as an ad overtook the device.



*Federal-ad 9358: We promise we won’t hurt you*.



My blood ran cold. 



“Mom,” I did my best to keep my voice level. “Who was on the phone?” 



“Oh, it was...” She said. Her face scrunched up as she tried to remember. 



“Mom?” 



“I'm sorry, dear, I-I can’t remember.” She seemed more embarrassed than afraid that she couldn’t recall such a simple fact mere moments after it had happened. I turned her phone off and placed it face-down on the floor. 



It took some convincing before mom and dad agreed to surrender their cell phones. But after they saw the ad that appeared on dad's phone, it became a lot easier.



*Federal-ad 7920: The horrors will pursue you through the screen*.



It’s inconvenient to live without a  smartphone in the modern world, but thankfully not impossible. Not yet. It hasn’t stopped the incidents, though. Sometimes, people in the street will very insistently hand me their phones where another ad awaits. It’s gotten more threatening, but thankfully I haven’t had another dream. 



I don’t know why it doesn’t speak to me like it did my mom, like it has others. Then again, maybe it has. Mom doesn’t have any memory of the call now, or what the person she spoke to sounded like.



 Maybe I get calls from it all the time.",1,1770426052.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1qxzntx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1qxzntx/disengaging_on_transition_day_and_loving_it/,Disengaging on transition day... and loving it!,"Hi all,

So transition days have been a point of contention for us this past year. SD10 and SS12 particularly. My SO is always flustered on these days and between the 2 hour round trip to pick them up EOW I realised I get crazy anxiety into the lead up and also so moody, I can pick fights over literal BS and I realised I just don't adjust to the change well in general. My SO and I argue more and then I feel like a guilty dark cloud around the kids and feel like a sh\*t human.

I decided yesterday to completely disengage from the moment SO left to do the marathon pickup. I'm also 5 months pregnant and have decided this is the only way to save my sanity. They're not \*bad\* kids per sé but there are gripes I have (read prev post for more info or to not feel crazy) like SD10 had 40, yes F-O-U-R-T-Y days off of school last year. Last week was the new school year and by day 3 she was off again citing she was vomiting (her usual go to) and asking her Dad to pick her up from her Mum's place so she wasn't home alone... no she doesn't have an illness (however is ADHD) but BP feel bad about the divorce so time off comes easy for her. Anyway so with the unpredictability of our weeks, I feel rocked pretty often even before our week comes around - and last night (Friday) when my SO came in and asked if I was going to come down and say hello I told him I was having alone time in the bedroom. It's now Saturday morning and I'm still having alone time. 

We haven't argued once, yes he seems slightly flustered doing everything himself, but I don't feel bad (a bit anti social yes) but honestly I feel like it gives everyone more time to assimilate including myself. SD10 has been talking in her baby voice all morning calling out ""Dadaaaaa!"" every time SO leaves her and I'm hoping it subsides over the weekend knowing she has her Dad all to herself. Also she feels she is able to make it to school on Monday (which unsure as she is complaining of coming down with a cold but wants to play Marco Polo in the pool outside so who knows) anywayyyy.... I'm not even facing the kitchen or messes and I told my SO I'd washed their sheets during the week and put them on their beds ready to make, I usually tell him to ""include the children more in chores"" but this week, I don't actually care and really trying to keep out of it physically and mentally and I'm much happier!

Last time they were here the kids ate all my pregnancy craving snacks (even though I fill pantry and fridge to brim for them coming) and I got so upset and as my SS12 put it ""crashed out"" - so this week before they came I put the ones I wanted in our second fridge/freezer in the garage in a little lunch box 🤣 as I know they wont look in there and literally do not move \_anything\_ out the way if they want to find something, and the rest of the snacks I wanted for me I took up to the bedroom with me. Yes it feels like I'm 20 and living with uni flatmates again but it's anything to save face, and not feel so invaded (?).

Now i'll probably get a bath, make a beeline for the door and go get my nails done while SO takes the kids to the beach and for Acaï bowls because they always ask ""what are we doing today"" and need to do at least 2/3 activities a day to feel satiated. 

I'll update if anyone is interested but honestly, I think I could be onto something here. I'd tried everything and it was getting mega stressful and I felt like I was a bad person for moaning and complaining all the time. When they come I have anxiety and my pot starts to boil over and by Thursday we're all on each others nerves. I'm scheduling my cleaner for mid week, not cooking because they only like plain food really and just really taking me time! Also setting up some coffee dates/activities with friends.

How do any of you disengage after being at the end of your rope? Did it work out? Also anyone pregnant or have OURs baby and do it? How did it/is it going?",4,1770425915.0,stepparents,1,0.83,False

So I want to just that I am not affiliated with Oromo outside of being their customer over the past 3 years. I was just recently informed by their owner that she’s been struggling to keep the coffee shop afloat for the past year. It’s been up and down for a while now. It turns out it’s been so bad, that she is forced to not renew the lease and most likely close the doors in the next few months. All I can say is, this place is such a vibe. In the BuckTown neighborhood Oromo is now a staple. Losing it will be so devastating and as someone who Reddits and knowing how much love and care we have in this community; I wanted to just find some support for Leyla. On top of everything, Oromo is one out of a few remaining Vegan/Vegetarian places within the BuckTown vicinity. I really think this community can help. It doesn’t take much, maybe just grab a coffee. Maybe just share with friends in the neighborhood. I just Oromo to be flooded with orders, and next time I come in there I want to see Leyla with a big smile and good news for me.

Every single cup no matter how I do it always come out so insanely sour. It comes out like warm honey and I'm fairly sure it's not under extracted. So why does it never taste good. Typically I put around 18 grams in and get about 40-50 out in roughly 28-40 seconds. I try to run it for longer hoping to get more sweet and bitter flavors to balance the sour. To test something I figured I should try a salami shot to see if I could taste any bitterness or sweetness from the coffee. But every cup from the salami shot was sour, the only thing that changed between cups was how thick it was. I would typically just make it into a latte but it's sour enough that it makes the milk taste bad. I'm using a higher temp, I've tried changing the dose, pre infusions made it so much worse and going finer doesn't seem to do anything but make it thicker and even more sour. I've no clue what to try next. Specifically its the huck vision and sound blend. I just don't know how what to change to get better flavor.

London remains the ultimate destination for higher education, housing some of the world’s most prestigious universities. However, the prestige of studying in the UK capital comes with a well-known reputation for a high cost of living. As of 2026, global economic shifts and local inflation have adjusted the financial landscape for students. Understanding these costs is no longer just a recommendation; it is a necessity for a successful academic journey. On average, a student in London should expect to spend between **£1,500 and £2,200 per month**, depending on their lifestyle and location. This guide provides a meticulous breakdown of expenses to help students navigate the financial complexities of London life.

# Cost of Student Accommodation

The single largest expenditure for any student in London is accommodation. Typically, rent accounts for **50% to 60%** of the total monthly budget. In 2026, the London rental market continues to be competitive, with prices varying significantly across the city’s transport zones. For many, finding the [best student housing in London](https://en.uhomes.com/uk/london) is the most critical step in the pre-arrival process. Here’s where [uhomes.com](http://uhomes.com) comes in. The platform offers various high-quality purpose-built student accommodations in London, featuring a blend of security, community, and all-inclusive utility bills that private rentals often lack. It offers a lowest price guarantee and 100% verified listings with on-site certification, directly solving the critical pain point of finding affordable and reliable accommodation abroad for many international students.

# Comparing London’s Transport Zones

London is divided into zones, with Zone 1 being the central hub and Zone 6 being the outskirts.

* Zone 1 & 2: These areas are closest to major campuses like UCL, LSE, and King’s College. A standard en-suite room in a student hall here can range from £350 to £550 per week.
* Zone 3 & 4: Areas like Wembley, Stratford, or Greenwich offer a more suburban feel. Rent here is more manageable, typically ranging from £220 to £300 per week.

# Average Monthly Rent by Accommodation Type in 2026

|**Accommodation Type**|**Monthly Rent (2026)**|**Key Features**|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|University Halls|£950 - £1,500|Managed, Social, Close-to-campus, All-inclusive.|
|Private Apartment|£1,900 - £3,000+|Independent, Private, Bills-excluded, High-autonomy.|
|Student Accommodation|£1,300 - £2,400|All-inclusive, Modern-amenities, Secure, Community-focused.|

Choosing the right housing early is vital. Those who secure their spot in the best student housing in London early in the year often benefit from fixed rates that protect them against the seasonal price hikes seen in late August.

# Cost of Digital and Utility Expenses

For those not living in all-inclusive student housing, utilities (electricity, gas, and water) are a significant variable. In 2026, these costs average £90–£130 per month per person in a shared house. High-speed broadband typically costs around £30 per month, usually split among housemates. Mobile phone plans are relatively affordable, with ""SIM-only"" deals offering large data packages for £15 to £25 per month.

# Cost of Food and Groceries

Food is the second most significant pillar of the student budget. While London offers world-class dining, relying on restaurants can quickly deplete a student's savings. In 2026, the average monthly grocery bill for a student who primarily cooks at home is estimated to be between £250 and £400.

# Supermarket Tiers in London

Strategic shopping is a hallmark of the savvy London student. The city’s supermarkets are generally categorized into three tiers:

* Budget Tiers (Aldi, Lidl): Ideal for bulk buying and staples. Students can save up to 30% compared to mid-tier stores.
* Mid-Range (Tesco, Sainsbury’s, ASDA): The most accessible options with frequent ""Clubcard"" or ""Nectar"" discounts.
* Premium Tiers (Waitrose, Marks & Spencer): Best for high-quality fresh produce but significantly more expensive for a full weekly shop.

# Dining Out and Socializing

Eating out in London remains a luxury. A meal at a casual chain restaurant (like Nando's or Wagamama) costs around £15–£22 per person. A coffee from a high-street cafe is now roughly £3.80–£4.50. To balance the budget, many students adopt a ""meal prep"" routine during the week, reserving dining out for special occasions or weekend social gatherings.

# Transportation Expenses

London’s transport network is one of the most efficient in the world, but it is also one of the most expensive. Fortunately, the city provides specific concessions for the student population.

# The 18+ Student Oyster Photocard

Full-time students living in London are eligible for an 18+ Student Oyster photocard, which provides a 30% discount on adult-rate Travelcards and Bus & Tram Pass season tickets.

* Monthly Travelcard (Zones 1-2): Approximately £118 with the student discount.
* Bus-only Travel: Approximately £1.75 per journey, capped at a daily rate.

# Personal Growth and Leisure: Hidden Costs of Student Life in London

Beyond the essentials, students must account for academic materials, personal care, and the vibrant social life London offers.

* **Academic Supplies:** While most resources are digital, students should budget roughly £20–£40 per month for printing, specialized software, or occasional textbooks.
* **Health and Wellness:** Students should factor in the International Health Surcharge (IHS) as part of their visa, but local gym memberships can range from £25 (Budget gyms like The Gym Group) to £80+ (Premium clubs).
* **Leisure and Culture:** London is famous for its free museums, such as the V&A and the Science Museum. However, West End theatre tickets (£30–£120) and cinema tickets (£12–£18) require careful planning.

# London Monthly Expenditure Review

To provide a clear picture, here are three estimated monthly budget tiers for a student in London:

|**Category**|**Budget Tier**|**Standard Tier**|**Premium Tier**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Rent (inc. Utilities)|£850|£1,400|£2,200|
|Food & Groceries|£250|£350|£500|
|Transport|£70|£120|£180|
|Social & Misc.|£150|£250|£500|
|Total Monthly|£1,320|£2,120|£3,380|

Ultimately, while London is an expensive city, it offers a range of options for every budget. By prioritizing the search for the right accommodation and utilizing student discounts, international students can manage their finances effectively while enjoying everything this global metropolis has to offer.

When asked why, I lied to spare her feelings and not cause potential additional drama. Could I have handled this better?","I had a date planned with with this girl who lives 80 miles away in another state then me, which on paper wouldn't be too bad, but the date we had planned required me to have to travel an additional 166 miles to get to the Amusement park. When we made the plans, I didn't know how ridiculously far it was, I was under the impression it was close to where she lives.

After some thinking, I decided to go through with the date, because it was gonna be nice to get out and have some fun. However later that night I found out how obscenely expensive the tickets were. They were gonna eat up two thirds of my budget. I didn't cancel the date right away due to how excited she was, but it did make me have serious second thoughts.

A couple days later she started trauma dumping on me. The next day she told me she got temporarily kicked out of her house, and was basically homeless for a day. Afterwards she ranted and ranted about how she hates everyone in her life, and can't wait to get away from all of it once and for all.

At this point I started feeling less like her date, and more like an older brother with the way she was talking to me about everything going on. I'm gonna be honest, I have my fair share of past trauma, but I'm in a better place nowadays, and I want my partner to be in a similar headspace. I don't want to revisit unnecessary drama if I can help it.

But I stayed the course because I didn't want to disappoint her, and again it's an Amusement park. I thought even if it makes me go broke, at least it'll be a fun day.

However almost a week before the date, I met someone I hit it off with immediately. She seemed to have a stable life going on, had a similar vibe to me due to how we dress. And best of all, she lives in the same city as me, which makes planning dates easy. And as harsh as this sounds, I thought she was more cute than the other girl.

I asked her out immediately to a movie. She accepted, and offered to have a coffee date a few days before our planned movie date to get to know each other. Everything was going great, however I still had that Amusement park date planned with the other girl. At this point I had made up my mind that I wanted to proceed with this girl.

It was only a handful of days left before the date was supposed to happen. She was extremely angry, not at me, but at everyone else. I could sense that the news of me cancelling due to everything that happened would not be taken well, so to spare her feelings, and maybe not seem like a jerk, I lied and said I needed to help out a friend with moving, and that it'd take a week or so to do.",0,1770425843.0,dating,3,0.33,False

The house I bought has all these wonder Miele appliances which I love but we really don't use the coffee maker.   We use the middle speed over in the middle ALL THE TIME and never use the big oven at the bottom.

Any suggestions on which model we should be looking at that will look seamless with our existing stack?

Are we being obtuse not using the bottom one (kind of a pain to bend down, and I assume not as fast to heat as the smaller oven in the middle)

Next thought was finish on Stones, but there are way to many lowspots. That’s just toooooo much work. After thinning the bevel I‘ve polished it with my highest synth (6k soft noname Dictum Stone) it brought out some nice detail seen on the Edge. 

Next thought was fingerstones. I only have synth‘s so I did Break of some pieces of an old 1k and 6k to try. But results are just ass tbh. I‘d really like to try some real JNAT Fingerstones but not easy to get rn and out of budget as well for now.

I have been studying for Mechanical engineering and have a few certificates. As well as working part-time at a TeleCo retail front.

So I have not been happy at my job for a while, I have been there 2 years. And because of the high turnover rate, I am the most tenured besides the managers.

I am second year into my bachelors and most places look for 3rd or 4th year students. And interships are taken up quickly by the more experienced students.

So I got really desperate and started the process of joining the Army. I got to the pyschological exam, passed but then backed out since the psychologist confirmed that only a technician job and not an engineering job would be available to me. And I would have to serve 4years before pursuing engineering again.

As well as I would be away from home for months or longer but I was prepared to sacrifice my relationships to advance my career and get out of customer service.

I backed out of that 4 days ago. I also just got back from some domestic travelling and picked up a cold so I have called off my shifts this week to recover.

So today, I woke and my partner's already out of bed and he just says in an annoyed tone ""Applying for jobs today?"", I said I'd need some coffee before doing anything. Once we had that, he was being really stiff in conversation. So I asked for him to talk about whats on his mind.

He said ""I'm annoyed that you're not applying for jobs, you hate your TeleCo job, and you've been saying you hate it forever.""

I said ""I just backed out of the Army which I was preparing for a whole month, that was 4 days ago! Can you acknowledge that? Also whenever I apply for jobs you just sit next to me and watch me like I'm some sort of kid. I can apply to jobs myself""

Anyways so would I be over-reacting if I moved into my own room? The lease on our rental ends soon and Ive been thinking about just getting my own apartment.

It seems like despite me being able to cover my expenses, the fact he has a full time job and a more established career he tends to burden himself with how our quality of life is.  He had 5 figures saved up when we first started dating and now he's hit 3 figures.

I brought up to him that I think we should try to live in our own studios/apartments just so that we can be accountable for how we spend money and not influence each other. That thought went away for awhile, but with his financial stress he's started to act this way towards my career and the thought has come up again.

He's not living paycheck to paycheck, he still has excess after his pay, he just spends it.

The day I reconnected with my friends, there she is. At my bestfriend’s birthday celebration. She added me on instagram right after that night. We started interacting with eachother online, liking posts, stories. We both knew something was there. Met her again about 2 times with the same friends, friends were even trying to get us close. I knew something was there. But neither of us took the first step to talk.

Just us.

7 months later, we started talking. She texted me. Would’ve started talking her sooner if I wasn’t dumb enough to start dating a girl, worst decision I ever made. 

Was single for almost a 1 year and a half after my divorce, then I decided to go for a girl who started talking to me, instead of the girl who I liked as well. Really bad decision, Went through a lot of bad shit with that girl. But life happens I guess. Taught me a lot.

After things ended with her, I started interacting with her again, she knew things ended with the girl I was dating, she started interacting with me too. And after sometime, she decided to finally text me. Yeaah, she made the first move.

But from there on, I knew I couldn’t mess this up. I knew for her to talk to me still, after knowing I started dating a girl while we were already having a small thing going on online, interacting with eachother. That she really actually liked me. She waited for me.. she wasn’t even seeing anyone during that time. 

We started talking, hit it right off. I took her out on a date just a few days later, we had an amazing time. We started seeing eachother often, then almost every day. Our bond grew quickly, intimacy started off soon too. 

This was the first time, in my life where I was in a healthy connection with someone.

This was the only time I felt like I could rest, I could breathe.

I spent my life guessing every move, being cautious. But this girl changed it all for me. 

She showed me something that I never had in my life.

Genuine care, reciprocation, respect, she was the girl who truly showed me appreciation for everything I brought. And she showed me that every time without a single miss. 

I was enjoying every moment with her. Not even a month, she introduced me to her family, was invited to birthdays, dinners. Gatherings, going playing sports with them. She even started introducing me to her closest friends, the most trusted ones she have. This all happened in about a month. She would invite me to come join coffees with them too. Her family loved me, her friends loved me. I’m a basketball coach for kids, they are a very important part of my life. Those kids, she even initiated seeing them and building a bond with them too. This meant a lot for me..

They all saw us perfect for eachother. She was so happy with how everything was going.

Deep down I was scared how fast it was going, but I was still so happy, someone proud to openly introduce and invite me into their world this way. I always wanted this.

She did all of this without having me to talk about it or even ask about it. It genuinely made me trust her and get even closer to her. I started introducing her to my closest friends, my family. Everything was going so well. She was loved by them too. 

I showed her appreciation, and love by treating her the best way that I can. Affection, care, treated her like a queen. In everyway. She brought so much happiness and light into my life, I never expected i’d have this. 

I wanted to give it all back to her just how she gave it to me. 

I asked her to be my girlfriend in the 2nd month. She happily said yes to the relationship. Few weeks later, during new years holiday time. I usually go on a solo trip at the end of the year, this time I decided to stay back and plan something with her. We both spoke about it, and I planned it all. Wanted to treat her since this would be our first trip together, she even talked about splitting the trip costs, but no way I was letting that happen especially for our first trip together. We agreed the first one’s on me and we’ll figure something out for the next trip. 

I wanted to surprise her and planned a trip to a resort, she had never been to one for a holiday. Leading up to this trip, feelings had grown in me. With how things were going between us, it felt mutual, in everyway. There was nothing but love in her eyes, the way she cared for me, treated me. i fell for her and I felt that she felt the same way for me too.

And on the trip, after dinner. Took her on a walk on the beach, decided to tell her how I felt about her. I said I love you to her. She responded, please don’t take this wrong way in any way. I like you so much, i love how everything is going between us. But i’m not yet ready to say I love you back to me. She still needed time for that and she didn’t want to say it to me in a situation she felt like she had to say it because I said I love you to her. She needed time.

We talked a bit about her past before, when I shared about mine as well. she was in a rough relationship with an avoidant, for almost 4 years. She went through a lot with this guy. We didn’t go much into detail at the time, I wanted her to bring it up on her own time and in time get to know about it. She has been broken up for 2 years, didn’t get into a any relationships after that. But she was still working with this guy. They built this business together with other friends, so they’ve been working professionally together for the last 2 years after the breakup with their friends. 

He moved on after telling her he’d get back with her, after their breakup but moved on with someone else while keeping her hanging, so she decided then it was over. But still had to keep seeing this guy often because of the business. 

So the night I said I love you to her, she brought that up again, she told me it took a really bad toll on her what he did to her. She had gotten very attached to him because she was living a really bad life with her family, bad problems, and he took her out of that life and she moved in with him. He was her comfort throughout all the bad things in her life, even though he was a bad partner to her. She is a loving, clingy person but he was avoidant, I need space kind of guy and she changed herself to match that. So she had gotten very attached to this guy. 

After things ended with him, She started taking therapy as well to help with what happened. She started getting closer to her family, rebuild her connections with them, she started being independent, living alone. She was not close to her family at all during the time she was with him. 

When I listened to her, I understood that it was With good reasons why she kept her distance from her family. Her dad isnt around, and her mom well not the best person and she told me why as well. But after the breakup, she was alone. She leaned back into building her independence, mend things with her family, get closer to them, started living alone. 

So after she told me all this I comforted her and told her, hey look I completely understand you. There’s no rush, I wanted to be honest about how I felt for you. Just because you can’t say it back right now, doesn’t mean things between us changes. It won’t happen, it doesn’t change anything about how I feel about you.

And everything was perfect throughout the trip, we had so much fun together, made so many memories, we made love to eachother every night. It was perfect. 

I never brought up or pressured her about not saying I love you back to me, didn’t even bring it up. We were the same every day, we showed up for eachother the same every day. Nothing had changed between us. 

Almost every day we saw eachother, spending time with eachother. 

But one night, she just texted me.

Things have gone too fast between us. I can’t pretend that things are okay between us. I don’t know why I don’t feel how I think I should feel about this, for you. I’m so confused right now. I need so much time, space to figure all of this out. Why i’m feeling this way. I’m so sorry i’m really trying to be okay. But i’m feeling so overwhelmed with everything. I don’t want to end things, i haven’t made a final decision but can you please give me some time.

I replied, it’s okay.  I understand. You can take your time and space.

She replied, i’m so sorry, please don’t be mad at me. 

I replied, I’m not mad.

She then asked me if she could meet me and talk to me in person so she can tell me everything more clearly. She doesn’t want me to get the wrong idea.

Then the next day we met.

So she told me, meeting the family, they really wanted to meet me, she also did too. But after that she started feeling it happened too fast, same thing with her friends too. Then she said my affection and the way I showed it. Through touch and words and actions, they felt so good but started to feel bad because things were already overwhelming around her. And when that happens she needed space but she couldn’t tell me that because she didn’t want to make me sad or upset. Didn’t want me to change who I was. She genuinely enjoyed it. But sometimes when she need that space, she couldn’t tell me so that was also bothering her.

Also my friends, this is something i also agreed with too. My friends started joking about kids and marriage, too early. I also didn’t like that. Made them stop immediately. But that also put a lot of pressure on her and made her scared. But my friends did tell her they were sorry, please don’t take it serious, we were just joking.

And she told me something new she didn’t tell me about the guy.

So he quit the business, right after new years and before we went on our trip. So apparently it actually really hit her a lot. Because it affected the business a lot too. And she outright said it’s not like i still love him. But i just need to properly grieve that as well. And alot of things have been just making her feel overwhelmed she just needs to figure out her feelings towards everything with me, her work. She’s just feeling overwhelmed with everything. She even said me saying I love you to her and not being able to say it after till that day also made her feel very guilty and it made things very hard for her too. 

After hearing all of this, I comforted her in every way to the things she told me. I didn’t give solutions, I listened and gave her comfort. I told her I understood, I want this relationship to feel good for the both of us, not just me. You are not forced to do anything, we are partners. We are in this together, I want you to happy too. Just as happy as I am. I’m glad you finally spoke about all of this and shared it with me. She said she’s also really glad she was able to finally speak up. She decided to bring it up because she didn’t want to keep holding this inside of her long enough for it to burst on me, turn into resentment. Get angry or lashing out at me. I’m the only guy who’s ever treated her this well so I don’t want to ruin this between us.  

So after we talked, we walked out of the restaurant, holding hands together. Went on a drive, dropped her off home. She gave me a hug, a long one. Said i’ll see you soon with a smile and she went in. Didn’t see after for 4 days after that day. She texted me that night however, saying just wanted to say I got home safe tonight from work, and say goodnight to you. I replied and that was the last time we talked. I gave her the space and time she asked for. 

4 days later, she messaged me. 

She had this wisdom tooth that’s been bugging her for a while now, she just hadn’t got the time to deal with that. Financially. So she broke the silence with that topic. We spoke that day for a bit. The next day also, and the day after. Things were going well. We were laughing, having fun. She was heart reacting to my messages. Showing warmth and genuine signs of reconnecting. She hadn’t gone out since the wisdom tooth had been talking out so I haven’t really brought up inviting her out or seeing her. Plus we just started talking to I wanted to give some time and not rush. But she kept saying how bored she was at home, doing nothing. So on the third day we were talking for a bit. I went to work. Later that night I just sent her a light invitation “when you’re feeling up for it, we should grab a coffee sometime”

She didn’t reply to the message the whole night. And later that night she messaged me.

Hey, I’ve been thinking about a lot of things. I still don’t think i’m ready for a relationship. I don’t think we should continue this. It’s not fair to ask you to wait for me until I figure myself out and i don’t even want to ask you to the for me. You have been such a great guy to me. 

I really hope you understand what i’m going through. 

It’s just not the right time 😔 she said it like this.

I replied this is really hard to hear, but I understand what you’re going through. 

I’m sorry things felt rushed that’s something I’ll take responsibility for as well. I hope you take care and i truly wish you the best.

Then she replied 

Please don’t blame yourself, it’s partially my fault as well. Always take care of yourself and please be safe 

Thank you so much for everything you did for me 🥺❤️

Said it just like this. I want to highlight the emojis because this is the energy she showed me. 

Can you all please tell me what you think. I’m really heartbroken. I don’t know what to do anymore. I didn’t expect this to end this way. I just keep hoping that she’ll come back. I just don’t know why this had to end this way. Everything was going so well.. 

After the break up, i haven’t messaged her. I only just sent a heart reaction to her last message and left it. Because I didn’t want to put more pressure and guilt on her by telling her how much she meant to me, that she made so happy as well, I didn’t want to put it out there in a message. I controlled myself because she was already overwhelmed by everything, feeling guilty about having to end this. 

She still follows me on instagram. Didn’t remove me or anything. She had a private account, she removed me from that however. Even the pictures she posted of us on our trip together on that account. She hasn’t been posting on her main account like she used to. She’s been very quiet after the break up. I have been respecting this break up. No matter how badly I want to reach out to her, this is i know a situation that can’t be solved by me texting her I miss her or I want her back.. ",1,1770425387.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

 When RPA returned, his demeanor had completely changed—he was pale and visibly shaken. He sat down heavily on our worn-out couch, clearly struggling to process what he had just learned. With a trembling voice, he explained that the note was from his mother, who had managed to locate him by using information from my previous job. During their conversation, she told him that his father had passed away and that she was already on her way to see him.

Mrs. A turned to RPA and, with genuine concern, asked why he hadn’t called to let his family know that he had gotten remarried. I was already aware that RPA had been married twice before me, so her question did not surprise me. Then, she asked when we had gotten married, and I told her it was in December of the previous year. Mrs. A smiled warmly at me and welcomed me into the family, her kindness leaving a lasting impression.

During our conversation, Mrs. A mentioned she wanted to set up a trust for RPA’s son. Sitting on the couch, I was taken aback; it became clear that she was unaware of her grandson’s fate. I turned to RPA and asked him if his mother truly did not know. Mrs. A looked at both of us, confusion evident in her expression. RPA then quietly told his mother that his only child had died, explaining that this tragedy was due to the poor choices of his first ex-wife.

 

Mrs. A’s reaction to the devastating news was immediate and profound. Her face turned ghostly pale, and if RPA and his brother had not been present, she might have collapsed right there in our living room. Recognizing her distress, I hurried into the kitchen and fetched her a glass of cold water, hoping it might help her steady. As the initial shock began to fade and the reality of her only grandchild’s death settled in, Mrs. A’s gaze fell upon a gold, well-worn picture frame sitting nearby. The frame held a cherished photograph of RPA’s son, illuminated by the soft glow of a blue candle. In my family, lighting a candle is a tradition that honors a child lost to death—a quiet act of remembrance.

Mrs. A turned to me, her voice trembling, and asked if the candle meant what she feared. I found myself unable to speak, so I simply nodded. Understanding washed over her as she gently picked up the picture, her hands shaking. She turned to RPA and, with heartbreak in her voice, asked why he had never called to tell her, or if he had ever informed his father. RPA quietly apologized and told his mother that he had never told his father either.

As 1997 approached, I found myself dreading the holidays. I never celebrated Christmas at the time, as it brought up other traumas from my childhood. When New Year’s Day arrived, it marked the beginning of subtle but significant changes in RPA’s behavior. The cracks in his carefully maintained mask became more apparent, especially after he received his settlements from his father’s estate.

When the weather permitted, RPA, long with his family we drove up to the land his father had owned near the Four Corners. This visit turned out to be both the first and last time I met my father-in-law. I helped scatter Mr. A’s ashes on the land, and as I walked back toward our cars, my eyes caught sight of animal bones—bleached white by the sun, stark against the cold and dark landscape. That image should have been a warning of what was to come.

Once all the checks from the estate cleared, I began to notice real changes in RPA. At that time, I was still working at Walmart but had been put on swing shifts. That’s when one of my “ghosts” from the past reappeared. I was joking around with my friend Jess in the store on Ash Wednesday, she couldn’t respond, something hit me so hard that it felt like my brain wanted to leap out of my skull and run a marathon around the store. It was then that I learned, because of that ghost from my past used my head as a hammer against the floor more than once years earlier, I had sustained brain damage. That day, I experienced my very first epileptic seizure, a challenge that would stay with me until this day.

Losing my job at Walmart marked a difficult turning point, especially as my doctors were still struggling to find the right medication for my condition. It was during this period of uncertainty that RPA’s true character began to emerge.

Once his settlement checks were cleared, RPA suddenly had nearly $250,000 at his disposal. Instead of using the money sensibly, he indulged himself with extravagant purchases. The first was a 1980’s Burgundy Trans-Am, complete with a gold Firebird emblazoned on the hood a turbo engine under the hood—a detail I remember vividly, the car’s driver’s side paint had rust near the back tire frame, a result of the harsh winter road salts in Colorado.

RPA’s spending did not end with the purchase of the car; he soon acquired a new computer as well. While I struggled to adjust to my health challenges and sought ways to cope, RPA retreated upstairs for hours at a time, painting his models and immersing himself in cybersex chat rooms with countless women. You may wonder how I discovered this. My curiosity eventually got the better of me one afternoon, and I sat down to read through some of the chat exchanges. What I found left me feeling deeply unsettled.

I went through those messages after RPA had left the house to purchase another model. Shortly afterward, I heard the distinct sound of his car returning to the parking lot. By that time, we were living in a townhouse on Yuma Street, a place I had chosen because it was still within my budget. I listened as the front door opened and closed, and heard him coming up the stairs toward me.

I sat in silence, unable to find the words to express what I felt as I stared at the computer screen and then at RPA. With tears streaming down my face, I finally managed to ask him one question: ""Why?"" RPA glanced at the computer, then at me, and his anger flared. He grabbed my arm, pulled me out of the chair, and snarled that I should mind my own business. Without another word, he shoved me out of the room and locked the door behind him.

My past experiences had taught me to keep my emotions bottled up, fearing that reacting might result in another violent outburst—perhaps even a blow to my face. So, I remained silent. Each night, I went to bed alone and woke with RPA snoring beside me. The medication I was on required me to eat, though I hated it, especially with the stress weighing on me. Most mornings, I would head downstairs, turn the TV  on low in hopes of not disturbing RPA, and work quietly on my cross-stitching.

On the third day after our confrontation, RPA began shouting, ""Jean, where are you?"" He hurried downstairs, still dressed in his boxer briefs, and sat on the coffee table in front of me. He touched my leg and apologized for overreacting. I simply nodded and returned to my cross-stitch pattern, recognizing his behavior as the beginning of his guilt phase.

A few weeks later, I unexpectedly crossed paths with my old friend Chris at the 7-11. We had been friends since grade school, and seeing him again after all those years brought a sense of comfort and familiarity during an otherwise turbulent time in my life.

Later that evening, Chris stopped by our apartment for a cup of coffee. While we sat together at the dining room table, catching up and sharing memories, RPA was upstairs, preoccupied as usual with his cybersex chat rooms. Suddenly, RPA must have heard our voices from downstairs because he stormed into the room, visibly furious. His anger was unmistakable as he demanded to know who the man sitting at the table was. I tried to calmly explain that Chris was just an old friend from years ago, but RPA was not interested in listening to any explanation. He abruptly told Chris to leave the apartment.

As Chris got up to go, he quietly slipped a piece of paper into my hand. In a low voice, he told me I could call him anytime—day or night—if I ever needed anything. With that, he left, and I was once again left alone with RPA and the mounting tension in our home.

As soon as Chris left, the atmosphere in the apartment shifted abruptly. RPA slammed the front door with force, his anger palpable as he approached me. His presence was menacing, and, without hesitation, he seized both my arms in a tight grip. He fixed his gaze on me and declared, ""Listen to me, Jean. You are mine, my wife. You are nothing without me. Got it?"" The intensity of his words and the aggression in his actions sent a wave of fear through me, a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I was deeply shaken, unable to find comfort or safety in my own home. That night, unable to face him or share the same bed, I chose to sleep on the couch, wrestling with anxiety and uncertainty about what might happen next.

The following morning brought a stark change in RPA's demeanor. Standing quietly over me, he appeared contemplative, his anger from the previous night replaced by a somber and regretful expression. His eyes reflected a deep sadness as he began to speak, offering an apology for his outburst.

Seeking to explain his behavior, RPA delved into the painful experiences of his past. He recounted memories from his previous marriages, describing the emotional wounds that still lingered. He spoke of one ex-wife, whom he held responsible for the tragic loss of his only child—a grief that seemed to haunt him. He also mentioned another marriage that had ended prematurely due to infidelity, leaving him with feelings of betrayal and disappointment.

As he finished sharing these memories, RPA reached out and gently touched my cheek, softly saying, ""Sorry, babe."" The sudden shift from anger to remorse left me feeling emotionally drained. I found myself struggling to navigate the cycle of fear and apology that had come to define our relationship, unsure of how to process the conflicting emotions that now surrounded us.

 

Less than a month after the confrontation, I began noticing troubling changes in RPA's behavior. He stopped wearing his wedding band, claiming he had lost it during a softball game. At first, I wanted to believe him, but a nagging doubt lingered in my mind.

Soon, his absences grew longer and more frequent. RPA would come home later and later,  until the point he came home between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, the time the strip clubs closed. Trust m,e I called one club to ask what the hours were. Each time, my gut instinct told me something was wrong. I tried paging him, hoping for a response, but only silence greeted me—nothing but dead air.

Driven by mounting anxiety and suspicion, I reached for the phone book, desperate to find answers about RPA’s whereabouts and the truth behind his late night came into the light.

 

In my desperation to uncover the truth, I closed my eyes and ran my finger down the phone book listings for local strip clubs. On the first number I finally, I mustered the courage to make a call. When someone answered—a man with a deep, gruff voice—I asked if he could help me, but he said he couldn’t. Refusing to give up, I pressed on, describing RPA’s appearance: light jeans, a tan shirt, and a red baseball cap. Suddenly, there was silence on the other end of the line. I took a deep breath and made my intentions clear and asked if man could pass a message on for me: if that man in that outfit wasn’t home within twenty minutes, there would be consequences meaning my bat  would meet his models. Then I hung up, waiting anxiously for what would happen next.

My frustration and desperation to reach RPA finally reached a boiling point. Determined to get through to him in a way that words could not, I marched upstairs to were he keep his  treasured model collection—his pride and joy, and possessions that meant more to him than almost anything else in our home. One by one, I carefully gathered the models, arranging them in a deliberate line across the downstairs area. These weren’t just small collectibles; they were impressive half-scale battleships and aircraft carriers, each one substantial in size. The smallest among them, the Arizona, stretched the entire length of my arm.

With all the models lined up in plain sight on the coffee table and the floor, I took my softball bat and readied myself for a practice swing. The message was unmistakable in both my actions and my resolve: I was prepared to use his expensive models as targets should he continue to ignore me and my growing distress. The threat was clear and direct—if RPA remained indifferent, his beloved collection would bear the consequences. In that moment, I wanted him to understand just how serious and determined I was to finally be heard.

Sure enough, within just fifteen minutes, I heard the familiar rumble of his Trans-Am pulling into the parking lot. He must have driven recklessly and broken several traffic laws because, under normal circumstances, it would have taken at least forty-five minutes for him to reach the front door from where he was. I turned off all the lights in the apartment and sat in the darkness, waiting for him on the couch with a softball bat placed prominently on the coffee table in front of me. As RPA burst in, flushed and out of breath, he immediately turned on the lights and began screaming at me, calling me crazy. I looked him straight in the eyes and replied with a sarcastic remark, pointing out just how quickly he had returned home. Then, with a snarl, I let him know that I was fully aware of the truth behind his late-night escapades. Without another word, I got up, headed upstairs, locked the bedroom door, and went to sleep. For the next couple of days, RPA barely left the house. He knew that I was serious, and that I had no qualms about treating his cherished models as mere pieces of plastic—items he had spent far too much money on—if he pushed me any further.

As time passed, RPA's true nature began to emerge more clearly. He installed a lock on the door where he kept his prized model collection, a move that seemed to signal a deeper change in his behavior. The unmistakable signs of infidelity soon followed. RPA would return home late at night, his clothing and even his skin reeking of cheap body spray. Sometimes, his bare skin sparkled with traces of body glitter—evidence he made little effort to hide. 

 Then one night, I heard that Trans-Am pull in front of our townhouse, and he walked in with some girl in stripper heels. She sat down on my white couch after that night. I wanted to burn that couch after she plopped her nasty, rotten crotch down her skirt. I could tell she did not have any underwear on.

As the tension in the room mounted, our cat wandered in, leaping up onto the coffee table. She settled herself among the chaos, her calm, unblinking gaze fixed on the scene unfolding before her. For a moment, her silent presence provided an odd sense of grounding, a reminder of normalcy in the midst of emotional turmoil. The cat simply observed everything from her perch on the coffee table, as if silently judging the absurdity of it all, while the rest of us grappled with the intensity of the situation.  Then it turned to me and made a statement that made my blood boil.

 

“You should be grateful your brother loves your retarded ass to let you stay in his home. “Without uttering a single word, I rose from my seat and walked into the kitchen. All the while, she continued to talk loudly, boasting about how RPA was paying her rent and covering her overdue car payments. She went on to say that once she moved into our home, both the cat and I would be forced out. According to her, she had no intention of living with a disabled person, and as for the cat, she made it clear that her dislike for felines meant our pet would have to leave as well. She even mentioned that she didn’t want any of her fellow dancers coming into a house with either of us there, describing how she intended to make the place her own—completely disregarding the life I had built and the home I shared with RPA.

 I walked over to the ledge between the living room and our small kitchen, where I kept my wallet. Carefully, I pulled out my ID, determined to have proof ready for what was about to unfold. My next thought was for Missy, our cat. I put down food for her, wanting to make sure she was safe and out of the way—especially since the woman sitting on my couch was about to face the consequences of her actions, and I didn’t want Missy anywhere near the chaos.

After ensuring Missy was occupied, I went to the cabinet above the microwave where I kept our important papers. I retrieved our marriage license, another piece of evidence to support my side of the story. The last thing I grabbed was the bat from the closet downstairs, a clear signal of my intent and the seriousness of the situation.

As I made my way back to where she sat, I recalled the urban legend that if a wife caught her husband cheating, she could kill both of them and somehow avoid jail time. It was just a myth, but the thought echoed the intensity of my emotions at that moment. Adding to my confidence was the knowledge that, at the time, Colorado had the “Make My Day” law on the books. Anyone who was uninvited or a stranger entering a home without permission, especially when not listed on the lease, had no legal right to be there. She certainly didn't have mine.

As I approached the woman sitting on my couch, her short skirt riding high, I could see her thong. She glanced up at me and turned noticeably pale. I realized that the look on my face must have terrified her—it was a cold, almost murderous smile. In that moment, I declared, “Really, I don’t have a brother—just a little sister,” and then pointed upstairs, clarifying that RPA actually just had an older brother. Without hesitation, I tossed my ID and our marriage license at her. She picked up the documents and examined them, her confusion mounting as she realized the truth of our relationship.

When she noticed the softball bat in my hands, I struck it against the arm of the couch, the impact reverberating through my bones. I warned her with steely resolve, “You have ten seconds—and nine of them are gone—to get the hell out of my house.” In a panic, she screamed and tumbled off the couch, crawling desperately toward the base of the staircase. One hof er heels snapped as she scrambled toward the front door, shrieking when the bat landed just inches from her feet.

At that moment, RPA came rushing downstairs, clad only in a towel and still dripping from his shower. I looked up at him and, with all the sarcasm I could muster, said, “I know incest is still illegal in the state of Colorado. When did I become your sister—since my maiden name is Eades, not A—” I pointed the bat at the woman again and announced, “Time’s up.” Raising the bat, I prepared to drive my point home as she cowered at the doorway.

 

In the chaos that followed, RPA grabbed the bat from my hands. He stared at the woman on the floor, her heavy makeup smeared and tears streaming down her face, before telling her to wait in the car. Turning to me, RPA accused me of acting crazy, then hurried off to put on some clothes. Undeterred, I followed him up the stairs and let out the most menacing laugh I could manage, warning him that he hadn’t seen crazy yet—and that he soon would see it.

The confrontation between us hit a boiling point as RPA, growing more agitated, raised his voice in an attempt to justify his behavior. He insisted that the woman was ""just a job,"" as though those words alone would erase the betrayal and turmoil he had brought into our home. I refused to let his excuses go unchallenged. Planting myself firmly in the center of the room, I crossed my arms and met his gaze with unwavering resolve. My voice remained steady, but there was no mistaking the firmness in my tone as I laid out the reality he was trying so hard to avoid. I made it clear that he, not the woman, was the one making the payments, and that those payments were for much more than the so-called arrangement he claimed. I recited, point by point, the explicit nature of what those payments truly represented, determined not to let him sidestep responsibility for his actions. Unable to face the truth, RPA hurriedly got dressed, his frustration mounting. He stormed out of the house, the sharp sound of the front door slamming behind him, leaving a resounding echo in the tense silence that followed.

The stress from the evening’s confrontation took its toll almost immediately, manifesting as a sharp, relentless headache that made it difficult to think clearly. Overwhelmed, I reached for the phone and called my friend Jess, desperate for a sympathetic ear. I tried to recount the events that had just transpired, but before I could finish explaining, my body betrayed me—a massive grand mal seizure seized control, cutting our conversation short. Thankfully, Jess was there for me in my moment of vulnerability. She managed to help me upstairs and get me safely into bed, despite my stubborn refusal to go to the hospital. The thought of another medical bill—one more burden to add to the stack—was simply too much for me to bear, so I insisted on staying home, clinging to the comfort of familiar surroundings and Jess’s steady presence.

1qxzds6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelArc/comments/1qxzds6/buyer_beware/,BUYER BEWARE,"Hello everyone,

I previously posted about issues I was having with the B570 when running an older DirectX 9 game from 2006. For anyone who’s on the fence about purchasing an Intel Arc card, I’d suggest keeping the following points in mind:

1. If you don’t plan to play DirectX 12 or Vulkan games almost exclusively, the value of this card drops significantly. Performance and compatibility outside those APIs can be very limiting.

2. If you plan to play older games, Linux may actually offer a better experience. Steam’s Proton translation layer converts non-Vulkan Windows games to Vulkan, which often results in better compatibility and performance than running them natively on Windows.

3. These cards do not pair well with pre-2022 CPUs.

I tested the card with two Coffee Lake CPUs (an i7-8086K and an i7-9700 non-K) and saw roughly a 60% FPS reduction in DX12 titles on Windows 11 compared to a modern i9-13900KF. This kind of gap doesn’t appear with other GPUs.
For comparison, I tested both my system and a friend’s system using an RX 9070 XT. When paired with the 13th-gen i9, the RX 9070 XT was only about 20–30% faster than my setup in games like Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Fortnite, and Mafia: The Old Country at 4K High.

4. Older OpenGL titles perform especially poorly.
I tried playing an OpenGL-based Disney game from 2008 with my son, and the B570 was sitting at ~70% GPU utilization while only delivering around 120 FPS. For reference, my GTX 1650 runs the same game at roughly 375 FPS while sitting at just 15–20% utilization.

Summary:
Intel Arc cards can perform well in modern DX12 and Vulkan titles when paired with a recent CPU, but they struggle significantly with older APIs like DX9 and OpenGL, especially on older PCs. If your library includes a lot of legacy games or you’re running pre-2022 hardware, these cards may deliver a noticeably worse experience compared to similarly priced GPUs. I know the GPU market is shotty right now, hence why I bought this thing. But again, buyer beware.",3,1770425175.0,IntelArc,2,0.71,False

They might send a flood of people here to discredit me by calling me crazy or poking holes in my logic. The herd mentality is very real so they will manufacture a herd to come here and discredit me, so you follow the herd they created. They will also downvote my post and comments while upvoting all of their own comments to give the illusion that no one believes me. They will attack your character, your sanity, or your credibility then point the finger at you and call you a bad guy for responding. This is textbook narcissism. Then they will report you for responding to their attacks to get you banned. Just be aware, when you see this in the comments, it is either a bot or someone sent by them to make sure no one believes what you say.

Here is some proof that hey send people to discredit you by calling you crazy and acting like they are not a mason. They did it on my previous post but then admitted it was them then threw a tantrum because I won't join them. They are doing the same thing here in this comment section

[Masonic Tantrum After I Exposed the Truth - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/masonic-tantrum-after-i-exposed-truth-QOKvKS9)



Here is their secret

Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. Eat kosher foods, the tiny hats that are hiding this information would not do this to their own people.

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  We take more than we need and even at the cost of others.

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",1,1770424875.0,LetsDiscussThis,0,1.0,False

Background: We are platonic friends. Solidly platonic for 15 years and we have lived together off and on. We live in the same city 10 min apart and he sometimes comes over and I host - drinks and charcuterie, which I clean up.

The situation: This Airbnb has a typical kitchen. He wanted food to eat in house and I usually eat out when on vacation. He’d make me coffee (coffee was there) and pour wine and munch on slices of cheese or ham but off of the waxed paper it came in. He decided to invite 2 friends over he hasn’t seen. He serves them wine and charcuterie. On plates. I decline to stay and meet them and say I want to enjoy the city. Since this is his last day where he needs to catch the train to the airport, I remind him before I leave for the day to be sure to pack the garbage and toss it, so I’m not left with a mess to clean up by myself. After he meets his friends he decided to find me to introduce me to the friends. No problem I meet them outside for 5 minutes then they leave to catch the train. Jay and I hang out in the city a bit more. He briefly mentions there is no dishwasher detergent. He then races to go back to the Airbnb at 7 to catch his flight. I continue to roam the city until getting back at midnight. He texted me to let me know he forgot a coat and to bring it back home. I walk in and there are dishes on the table (3 wine glasses 7 dishes a glass in the bathroom etc) none of it mine. It’s my vacation. I eat out so I don’t need to do dishes like I’m home. I specifically didn’t stay to meet either of his friends in the house because I didn’t want to host.

I confronted him not too elegantly on this. I feel a bit bad but quite frankly I told him “ I don’t like staying generally at Airbnb with guys because I want a vacation I do not want to feel like I’m home away from home.” He needs to “not be cheap if he doesn’t want to do the work and take them out instead”. I also informed him that if he thought there was no dishwasher detergent then even more reason to do the dishes. His response was “thanks for your input.” Between needing to find space in luggage where I only brought carryon and then leaving the garbage including several wine bottles and all the dishes to wash  - it felt disrespectful.

1qxz4w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1qxz4w4/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

Computer science at UMD

I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

Over the past while I’ve been working on something that started very simply, just noticing how many people around me are quietly struggling with loneliness and social isolation. Not just seniors, but students, newcomers, people working long hours, people surrounded by others yet still feeling alone.

Canada talks a lot about mental health, but loneliness itself is often ignored, even though it affects physical health, mental health, and community trust in a big way.

I’ve been building a couple of small tools to help address this in a practical way:

One is TalkLoop, which lets people connect through phone calls. No apps, no downloads. People can call in and be connected with trained volunteers who just listen and talk. The idea is simple human connection, especially for people who don’t have someone to talk to.

The other is Keep It Spreading, which focuses more on in-person connection. It lets people share where they are in the community, like a coffee shop, library, mall, or park, and what they’re open to doing, maybe chatting, playing cards, or just venting. Others nearby can see it and choose to meet up. It’s about making connection feel normal again.

This isn’t a business idea for me. It’s more of a community project that I’ve been building step by step, mostly on my own time and energy. The response so far from people has been very real, which tells me the need is there.

I’m posting here because I honestly don’t know the best path forward when it comes to funding or support. Not huge money, just enough to keep things running and growing responsibly.

If anyone here knows about: – local grants in Windsor or Essex County
– community foundations
– mental health or social connection funding
– organizations that support grassroots initiatives

\- all over body moisturizer. My skin sucks everything up and is still dry dry dry

\- facial moisturizer. I barely need anything in the summer but wow, am I dry now

\- A good lipstick for menopausal women that’s more moisturizing?

And, this one is not winter related but I need a good cleaning product for my vulva and that general region. Specifically for quick touch up cleaning between showers because wow, I often feel like I really smell like pee😕🤢😳

And some products I love:

\- Live Conscious collagen. I started taking it daily in my coffee about 6 months ago and wow, my hair and nails grow fast. My hairdresser commented on how much better my hair looks, since I’ve been using it, and less gray.

\- Jones Road WTF- this is saving my face on winter especially. I like the light glowy coverage combined with deep moisturizing

\- Magnesium oil spray for aches and pain. I use it at night and it helps relax me, but also I spray it directly on any areas where I have muscle pain and it really helps. This is on top of the HRT I take which cleared up most of my pain. But I especially love using the magnesium oil spray after working out.

1qxz265,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qxz265/am_i_getting_in_my_own_way_to_finding_a_partner/,Am I getting in my own way to finding a partner by having too many expectations?,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here.

As I put in the title, I am wondering if anyone can give me advice about what I could be doing wrong as far as my dating success. 

I am a 28 y/o woman-shaped pansexual NB with AUDHD. I live in a medium sized city typically with a mixed population that is diverse due to having a popular university nearby so my town often gets new people coming and going. I am also not very far from larger cities that I visit occasionally due to having a high mileage job. 

The past several years I’ve had experiences with dating but nothing has really stuck due to me feeling like I haven’t really aligned with anyone. As time goes on and I continue to struggle with dating, and due to a friend recently making a comment that I “take myself too seriously and have too many standards for dating” being the reason I remain single I’ve started to actually feel like maybe I am the problem. 

I have tried to meet people in person at local events, social settings, and I have used apps and made efforts to meet people off of them but I seem to have no luck. 

Some of the things I’ve tried to keep in mind or look for when considering partners are below: 

Age range 26-34

Gender identity and expression: any, I love everyone

Education level - high school graduate at minimum is preferred but I am open minded if I like the person

Career-any that could be viable long term is preferred but I’m flexible

Moral/political Alignment - I prefer someone with 80-100% alignment of morals, values, and politics to my own 

Preference that the person has transportation so that there can be equal efforts in making trips to see one another depending on distance 

Non negotiables: cannot be anti-trans, anti-lgbt, anti-immigration, anti-equality, anti-women, anti-abortion, essentially anything that is pro oppressing a group of people 

Preference in physical appearance and characteristics: I have no preference in height, weight, colors of hair eyes skin etc I can love anyone

I do prefer people who express similarly in fashion/body modifications to me as I have tattoos and piercings and it is generally easier to date people who have/are ok with these things for me. 

I enjoy alternative or eccentric styles and am interested in cosplay. I love experimenting with different styles of dress and have always been interested in the history of fashion. I enjoy trying to look and feel my best in fun or interesting/ non standard clothing and I like to see others doing the same. 

I have interests in cooking, gaming, fashion, cosplay, dnd, mtg, movies and plays, music, anime, reading, traveling, exploring haunted attractions, paranormal stuff, vampires, etc. I really would like to find someone with shared interests to me. 

I am open to dating people who don’t align with me religiously or spiritually as long as their beliefs do not cause conflict with mine (such as attempted conversion or repeated conversations invalidating my beliefs) I believe my current spirituality is considered to be pagan as I have several altars to various deities in my home (including hades, Persephone, Demeter, and Asclepius.)

I occasionally drink socially and do not mind if someone I am with drinks, or is sober. 

I prefer to find someone without a criminal history, however depending on the severity of the crime and the age I can be open minded. (Example mistakes made as children as long as there is not a significant harm to another person). I am not open minded to violent acts or anything where another person was significantly harmed. 

I am comfortable with infrequent communications with a partner if the conversations had reflect honesty, interest, care, respect, and have at least some semblance of depth (not just small talk once a week) (prefer communication to be at minimum 2x a week depending on the quality of the conversations had when communication occurs) (I understand people’s work life and social balance can be hard which is why I try to be understanding about infrequent communication) 

 

I also prefer to be able to see the other person once a month at minimum but am willing to compromise depending on the situation(busy work schedules or distance between places of living) (I’ve had issues in the past where potential partners did not want to make time to meet in person) 

I enjoy being able to have outing dates like coffee, dinner, park visits, cemetery visits, activities like movies, swimming, hiking, concerts, plays, museums or art galleries, and other things. I also equally enjoy nice at home things such as shows, movie marathons, games or board games, making meals together, crafty things, etc. I have no preferences for out or in dates I just like to have intentional time spent with my person. 

I enjoy anything that shows care, consideration, and thoughtfulness 

I like gifts but I have always preferred handwritten and handmade gifts to expensive items. Drawings, paintings, crafts, heartfelt notes and letters have my heart. 

I like trying to learn about and share interests and hobbies with others even if I didn’t like it before, and I like for others to try and do the same for me. 

I used to think that I didn’t hope for too much with this stuff but again, due to repeated struggles with dating and advice from my friend i wonder what I need to do differently.

1qxz13i,https://i.redd.it/p3vuw4abwyhg1.jpeg,"Crumb Couture by Snif: A Cozy, Edible Fantasy in a Bottle","Crumb Couture by Snif is a fragrance that immediately signals one thing: comfort, sweetness, and a little bit of indulgence. Right from the first spritz, it feels like stepping into a cozy bakery on a quiet weekend morning. It’s a gourmand fragrance, but not in a cloying or juvenile way, it leans into warm, buttery, slightly toasted pastry notes layered with soft, sweet fruits and a gentle woodiness underneath.

The Scent Journey

Opening: The first moments of Crumb Couture are all about the croissant accord. There’s a rich, flaky, buttery warmth that is almost edible, but not artificial. You also get a hint of berry or jam, sweet, but tart enough to keep the fragrance from feeling one dimensional. This combination creates a feeling of nostalgia: mornings at a café, the smell of warm bread, and perhaps even a touch of coffee in the background.

Heart / Mid Notes: As it settles, the fragrance smooths into creamy vanilla and soft tonka bean. The berries retreat slightly, leaving a warm, cozy sweetness that hugs the skin. The fragrance becomes comforting rather than attention grabbing, like the olfactory equivalent of a soft blanket.

Drydown: Finally, Crumb Couture reveals its sandalwood and subtle woody undertones. These give the sweetness structure, preventing it from becoming overly cloying. The drydown is intimate, soft, and slightly powdery, leaving behind a lingering warmth that feels natural rather than synthetic.

Crumb Couture isn’t about making a statement; it’s about creating an experience. It’s an edible fantasy, cozy and comforting, and it hits the nostalgia button like few other fragrances do. It’s ideal for those who want a gourmand that’s soft, approachable, and a little playful, not overpowering, not overdone, just comforting and delicious.

If you’re looking for a fragrance to wrap yourself in like a warm pastry and a soft blanket, Crumb Couture is a quietly indulgent choice. It’s a love letter to dessert inspired scents done with subtlety and care.",1,1770424269.0,u_ary_fragrance,0,0.99,False

It Started at 336 Hours. Now There’s One Left.,"If you ever hear an automated voice from the street calmly announcing the number of hours left until the end of the world, do not ignore it.

I know how that sounds. I tried to dismiss it the first time too, but then it kept coming back again and again. 

I don’t know how many of you have seen the van, or if anyone else can even hear what I’m hearing, but I need to explain myself before I don’t get the chance to at all. 

I’m not special, I’m the kind of guy you would pass on the street and not give a second glance to, but that’s what makes me worry even more. 

If something like this can happen to me, there’s no reason it can’t happen to you. 

My name is Carlos, and up until recently, I was just some guy trying to get through college, a full-time job, and a half-serious attempt at making music on the side when I have the time. I had routines, plans, dreams…but all of that was before I knew that every tomorrow was one step closer to ending a countdown.

For the past couple weeks, there’s been a white van that has driven slowly through my neighborhood in twelve-hour intervals. Once at 7:03 am, and the next at 7:03 pm like clockwork every day. Each time it passes, there’s a voice that comes from the speaker mounted on top. The message being spoken never changes, only the number does.

“This is an official announcement. You have 336 hours until the end of the world. You have 336 hours until the end of the world.”

That was what it said the first time I heard it half-asleep and standing in my kitchen waiting for my morning coffee to finish brewing. My ears only picked up on the cadence of the voice, not the actual words being spoken. 

The voice didn’t speak like a normal person would. It was monotonous yet polite. It’s the kind of voice that you would expect to hear from an automated phone menu except syllables are dragged out when they shouldn’t be and there are pauses throughout that are either abrupt or random.

I wrote it off as a test done by the city to see if their safety announcements were working, but when I heard the sentence repeat itself with the exact same tone and inflection, that’s when it clicked. I still get the chills thinking about the moment when I realized what it was that I was hearing.

I don’t have a whole lot of time left, and even worse, I don’t even know what exactly happens when the countdown reaches zero. All I know is that the closer it gets, the harder it is to trust my own reality.

If you’re reading this and you’ve seen the van, or if in the unfortunate event that you ever do, treat what I have written here in this post as a guide of sorts. This is what I’ve had to learn the hard way. I don’t know if any of this will necessarily save you, but it might buy you more time than I have remaining.

\*\*Do not assume other people can hear the announcement\*\*

The message is not a public broadcast, and it is not something that anybody else can hear. As far as I can tell, it is meant for you and you only.

I made the mistake of asking others what they heard the first few times the van had come by. Neighbors and strangers all told me the exact same thing, there was no voice or a van matching my description. Some of them said they only noticed an ice cream truck, others said they saw a utility vehicle, and some even claimed to have seen nothing at all. 

They just looked at me like I was clinically insane. One neighbor even began avoiding me completely after that, and I can’t necessarily say that I blame him for doing so. I mean, a stranger declaring that there’s a van announcing the end of the world is not exactly comforting in the slightest. 

That’s when I realized that the more I tried to explain it to people, the smaller my world actually felt.

If you’re hoping someone else can confirm what you’re hearing, don’t count on it. The more you continue to push the issue, the more isolated you’ll end up becoming. 

Save yourself the confusion, and more importantly, save yourself the doubt. Do not ask anyone else for reassurance. It will only make you question whether or not things are real.

\*\*Do not record the van’s announcement expecting proof\*\*

 

I thought about recording what I was seeing, and after days of feeling as though I was imagining things, I decided to go through with it. If I could just capture it once, I’d finally have something solid to point to. After all, a camera never lies, right? That’s what I initially thought too…until I realized that wasn’t true.

Recording the van doesn’t work like you think it would.

Every video I took on my phone either ended up a corrupted mess or it showed something completely normal. I’ve tried other devices too such as a laptop, a personal camera, and even a phone I’ve borrowed from a friend. Every single one of them has had an issue playing back the recording ranging from the audio being completely omitted to the video glitching out and cutting to black before the announcement would start.

Every attempt ended with the same result, nothing that proves what I saw or heard.

The worst part about it all wasn’t necessarily the failure, it was watching the recordings afterward and realizing that I can’t even show people what I’m talking about. If someone had come up to me and shown me those videos without knowing what they were talking about, I would’ve dismissed them without a second thought too.

Recording the van will not give you answers, it will only give you evidence that contradicts your own memory. Trying to document it is no different than asking someone else to confirm your experiences. Walk away with whatever certainty you have left because once that’s gone, you won’t get it back. 

\*\*Do not engage with the voice. It only provides updates, not answers to questions\*\*

The announcement is not an invitation for conversation. It doesn’t explain itself, it only declares its message and departs.

After the first few times the van had come by, I finally asked what it meant by its broadcast. The voice only repeated the announcement except much louder this time. What made it even stranger was that the harsh and distorted words felt invasive, like it was coming from inside my mind rather than outside.

I tried asking what it meant again another day, but the same thing happened.

The voice will not answer, argue, or bargain with you. It won’t clarify anything. The only thing it will do is finish speaking its message. 

Treat the announcement like a warning and not an explanation. It is not there to help you understand, its only goal is to remind you how much time you have left.

\*\*Do not check the time immediately after hearing the announcement\*\*

Do not look at a clock, your phone, a watch, or anything else that tracks time for at least a few minutes after the announcement ends. I cannot stress this enough.

It’s a mistake that will cost you precious time.

There was one time that I checked my phone a moment after the van passed by without thinking. When I looked up from my phone, six hours had gone by.

All that time had passed in the blink of an eye.

I was standing in the same spot, holding my phone, but the light outside had changed and my body felt incredibly sore for some reason.

The van’s schedule never changes; it arrives at the same times every day. The countdown is the only thing that accelerates. Whatever time you lose is taken directly from the number being announced, not the time of the real world.

Ever since I’ve made that connection, I make sure to hide anything that tells time before the van’s arrival. I don’t check until the street has fallen completely silent and the van is long gone. I’m not sure how long you’re supposed to wait, only that it’s best to keep time out of sight and out of mind.

I know it’s easier said than done but you need to do this. Preserve every second as there is no way to get back that time you lose.

\*\*Write things down by hand if you need to remember them\*\*

Your memory will not be reliable for long. What will start off as easily dismissible gaps in time will turn into missed conversations, plans you can’t remember agreeing to, and entire hours lost and unaccounted for.

With so much going on in my life, writing things down in my agenda book is something that feels second nature to me. I didn’t expect something so mundane to become a survival mechanism. Don’t second-guess yourself because anything you don’t physically write down is at risk of slipping away.

I’ve tried using reminders on my phone such as notes apps and scheduled emails to myself, but technology isn’t reliable. 

My notes would always end up deleted and emails would arrive later than when I knew I had scheduled them.

Technology is easily corrupted but by what exactly is uncertain.

If you need to remember something, write it down yourself and keep it somewhere you’ll see it often. Read it regularly to remind yourself of what you plan to do and what you already know.

If you don’t, you’ll start relying on a memory that would rather betray you than tell the truth.

\*\*Stay within familiar areas\*\*

Don’t think you’re clever enough to avoid the van by leaving before it arrives, it’s not as easy as you might think. 

I tried to do that once. Just before the scheduled 7:03 am announcement, I got in my car and drove wherever new streets could take me. Places I’d never been before and thought I could find refuge in even for a little bit.

But it was all in vain.

The van still found me and gave the announcement exactly on time. But what was peculiar was that when it spoke, everything around me changed. 

Streets stretched endlessly towards the horizon, turns repeated themselves in nauseating twists and knots, and buildings that I had passed not even moments prior had seemingly vanished without a trace. 

The GPS app on my phone kept reconfiguring or never settling on a route entirely. Technology only confirmed my worst fear in that moment, I had no idea where I was.

Eventually though, my surroundings did return to normal. But even at this exact moment, I still don’t entirely trust the outside world when the van is near.

Unfamiliar places don’t protect you; they only expose you more. The less you recognize your surroundings, the harder it becomes to tell how far you’ve gone or how long you’ve been gone for.

You cannot outrun the van or hide from it. It will always arrive to deliver its message whether you are ready or not.

It is for that reason that it is important to stay somewhere where you can anchor yourself to what’s real. 

Anything unfamiliar will only give it more chances to take time from you. 

\*\*Do not try to follow the van\*\*

Following the van doesn’t solve anything so don’t do it under any circumstance. I thought that if I could just trail it long enough, I might learn where it came from or where it goes after the announcements end.

I was wrong.

If you try to follow the van, you won’t find answers.

You have better luck winning the lottery multiple times than to successfully follow the van. 

It always remains just far enough ahead that you can’t quite catch up no matter how fast you go. If you do somehow manage to get somewhat close to it, the van will just turn a corner and be gone.

The longer you follow it, the more you feel like you’re chasing a ghost.

Do not follow the van, but if you ignore my warning for some reason then I implore you to pay very close attention to the one that comes next.

\*\*Do not approach the van if it has come to a full stop\*\*

There was one time when the van stopped completely outside my house.

It didn’t stall or pull over and park next to the curb, it just came to complete halt in the middle of the street after it finished its announcement. 

I went outside to investigate and heard the engine was still running but couldn’t get a proper look inside the vehicle. When I got closer, I heard the driver’s side door creak open slightly.

I thought someone was finally going to step out and confront me. After all this time, I assumed that was the point of all this. This one interaction could have been the answer to getting an explanation for everything.

Could have been.

Instead, when I got closer, the door swung open without warning and hit me square in the face with a metallic clunk. I remember the sudden warmth of blood dripping down my busted nose as I cried out in pain.

Before I could even react or get a grip of my spinning surroundings, the door slammed shut and the van sped off, disappearing down the boulevard.

Before all of that happened, I was able to get a good look inside, but it left me feeling only more bewildered.

There wasn’t anybody behind the wheel of the van nor was there even an impression in the driver’s seat. The only thing I saw was an empty front cabin as if the van didn’t need anyone to operate it.

If you’re trying to figure out who’s responsible for this, don’t. You won’t find anybody who can or will provide the answers that you’re looking for. That’s not what the van does. It only stops to remind you that it is the sole controller of the distance between you and it.

Do not approach the van if it stops. 

The closer you get, the more you risk putting yourself in physical danger.

That’s not something you want.

\*\*Do not involve those you care about\*\*

Don’t bring people you trust into this thinking you can find solace in their reassurance. I tried to tell friends. Family, co-workers, anyone that I thought might listen long enough to help me make sense of what was happening, but none of them believed me.

My concerns were laughed away or written off as the product of a lack of sleep. A few people did genuinely try to be kind about it, but their only suggestion was that I seek therapeutic help. No one ever seemed to take me seriously.

I wish I hadn’t ever brought it up to anybody because after I talked about the van to others, the announcement changed slightly.

After it told me how much time I had left, the voice began adding details it never had before such as names and addresses. Things it shouldn’t have known unless it had known the entire time I was explaining myself to others. 

They were all delivered in the same monotonous, automated tone like the rest of the messages that had come before. 

It didn’t threaten them outright, but it didn’t have to. Hearing the names alone was enough to understand the implications of what it meant.

This isn’t something you share, this is something you’re forced to carry alone. 

The second you decide to get someone else involved, they become part of the countdown whether they believe you or not.

If you care about anyone at all, keep them out of this. Stop talking and quit explaining yourself. Distance yourself from everyone however you have to. Let others think you’re unreliable, dramatic, or have gone off the grid.

It’s better than hearing the van speak the names of others and knowing that you’re the one who put them in danger.

\*\*Do not ask what happens at zero\*\*

I don’t recall exactly how I phrased the question, only that the words slipped out before I could stop myself. 

The announcement was halfway through its usual loop when I spoke, and for the first time, it didn’t finish its sentence.

I don’t remember anything that came after that. All I know is that I was standing on my front porch when it started, and then I wasn’t there when it ended. Everything in between feels like a gap my mind refuses to fill.

What I do remember is that in the days following, I didn’t sleep. When I finally did, the nightmares were worse than being awake. I’m not sure how to describe exactly what I saw, but I remember the feeling of reaching zero and realizing it wasn’t an ending at all.

Do not ask what happens at zero because whatever answer exists is not meant to be remembered.

I need anybody else who has experienced this to tell me what happens when it reaches zero.

Does the world actually end or does it just end for whoever listens to the message? 

The van said I had twelve hours left this morning. 

It’s been eleven hours since then. 

Please…time is running out for me.

If this post buys you more time than it bought me, then don’t waste a single second of it. 

I don’t know if I can save you. 

I don’t know if I can save anyone. 

The only thing I know is that I can no longer save myself.

If you’re still reading this and the countdown hasn’t reached zero, then maybe you’ll hear from me again. 

Or maybe you won’t. 

I don’t really know anymore… 

I don’t have much longer left to know.",3,1770424164.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Email from the city:



One of the most anticipated construction projects has officially begun in downtown Olathe.



Work has begun at the 100 block of Cherry Street as the LANE4 Property Group and Austin’s Bar & Grill begins the interior demo of what will become the County Square Commons.





Overall project start date – Interior demolition is set to begin next week and their hope is to be complete by Labor Day, 2026. The fencing has gone up in the Chestnut Street parking lot behind the project location.



The portion of the parking lot that is affected is only about 15 spots right up against the building. On Cherry Street, only the parking spots just outside of 114 N. Cherry St. will be closed during the duration of the project. See the map above for reference.



More Downtown Olathe Updates 

As the weather gets a bit warmer, there’s plenty going on in downtown Olathe. Things are definitely heating up along with the weather.





Some projects are moving quickly, others are still finding their footing, but downtown is evolving with intention, patience and a definite long-term vision.





Char Bar continues to work through final plans and, while the timeline is still uncertain, the intent to land downtown remains strong.



Duck Donuts has already received a Downtown Improvement Grant and is planning a location next to The Cutting Room on Kansas Avenue, bringing more than just donuts to the mix with coffee, milkshakes and breakfast sandwiches.



Momentum is also turning into near-term openings. Third Street Social is wrapping up construction with work expected to finish toward the end of April and an opening projected in May, adding another major anchor to the downtown dining scene.



Lucky Rooster Yarn has already woven itself into the community since opening September 13, offering yarn, knitting supplies, and hands-on knitting and crocheting classes that bring both creativity and foot traffic downtown.



Meanwhile, a new speakeasy concept supported by a Downtown Storefront Grant has completed demolition and is now awaiting final architectural plans, signaling that another unique experience is on the way.



Additional investments continue to line the streets. Maxi Laine’s, a Kansas City–based apparel boutique located just west of Junque Drawer, has received a Downtown Storefront Grant and is still working toward an eventual opening, with early 2026 most recently reported.





And supporting it all, construction on the downtown parking garage is scheduled to begin in early June, laying essential infrastructure to support continued growth, new businesses, and increased activity.



Downtown Improvement Grants 



The City of Olathe’s Downtown Revitalization Grant Program supports property owners and tenants in revitalizing downtown storefronts and retail spaces. Maxi Lane’s and the new speakeasy, both in downtown, have already received funds through the Downtown Revitalization Grant Program.



The program is designed to foster historic preservation, vibrant streetscapes, and small business growth and retention by providing matching grants for exterior and interior improvements. The City will provide a 50 percent matching grant (up to $50,000) for eligible improvements for the exterior or interior of the building.",11,1770423576.0,Olathe,2,1.0,False

1qxyq6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qxyq6c/im_in_jail_for_insurance_fraud/,I'm in jail for insurance fraud,"I’m Ridgey. I’m in jail for insurance fraud. I can’t tell you much about it, but a couple of things are relevant. For one, I never hurt anyone. That’s not me. Second, I was damn good at it. If it hadn’t been for someone stabbing me in the back, I’d be living the high life right now. Instead, I’m here. Still in jail.

But yeah, there’s a bit more to it. I’ve tried telling this story a couple of times, but there ain’t many folks around that care to listen. I’ll just throw this out there. Maybe you’ll learn something. Maybe you know something.

 

I got here a couple of years ago. It was pretty uneventful. All of a sudden I’m standing there with a handful of necessities next to a guy named Marco, being told we’re living together. I was so scared I didn’t know what to do. I stood there for about half an hour before Marco turned around and took a nap. I don’t think he was tired, but it was too awkward to tell me straight up that he wasn’t going to hurt me. I wasn’t worth the hassle.

Jail isn’t as dramatic as you might think. Don’t cross any lines and don’t expect any favors, and you’ve done most of the work. You get used to the rhythm of things pretty quickly. You keep your head down, do what you’re told, and don’t go asking too many questions. If a CO tells you to go back to your cell, you go back. They’re gonna be around just as long as you – don’t make enemies with ‘em.

And I mean, yeah. I saw some things. It wasn’t my business. Some people shuffled around duct-taped packages or flashed a blade when the guards weren’t looking. Most of it was for show.

 

I tried not to make trouble, but it’s hard to be off the radar. You start testing boundaries. You get confident, you know? I didn’t want to add years to my sentence, but I figured that if I could make my stay a little easier, that wouldn’t hurt. For example, there was one CO who was always wearing gloves. We called him Pot, as in Potbelly. I managed to trick him into coating his fingers in peanut butter without him noticing, and he went to input a four-digit code to get in one of the supply closets. Since his fingers were sticky, I could check which buttons got stuck. Then it was just a numbers game. I handed that information off to Marco and some of his guys for half a box of chocolate bars from the commissary. Harmless.

Well, the guard didn’t think so.

No one got hurt, but there was an inquiry as to how the inmates managed to get unsupervised access to the supply closet. Some folks stole some stuff. There was this one guy who took drain cleaner, and he was planning to do something nasty with it. The guards caught on before he did. That made them ask some questions, and while it didn’t incriminate me directly, it put me on Pot’s radar. He didn’t have any evidence, but he didn’t need any. He saw right through me, and he stopped wearing his gloves all the time.

 

For a couple of weeks, that was all there was to it. A couple of nasty looks when we crossed paths in the hallway. I kinda forgot about it, and I promised myself I wouldn’t roll the dice like that again. Then one day, during lunch, Pot comes up to me. I thought he was gonna smack me across the face, but instead he patted me on the shoulder.

“Thanks for the bench thing,” he smiled.

I looked at him and raised an eyebrow. I had no idea what he was talking about. Then he wandered off. Marco was sitting across from me, enjoying some beans in tomato sauce. I could see something in his eyes darken as he put down his spoon.

“Why did he say that?” he asked.

“No idea.”

“What bench thing? What did you-“

Marco shook his head, then frowned. He pointed a finger at me.

“Did you say something about the hiding spot?”

“What hiding spot?”

“There’s… by the bench. Back of the yard. Don’t tell me you don’t know.”

I didn’t know, and I tried to tell him – but he was already rattled.

 

See, there was this hiding spot out in the yard. It was sort of a dead drop that some of the guys used to move stuff. It was a hollowed-out spot on the bottom of a bench in the yard, no bigger than a fist. I’d never heard about it, but all of a sudden, people were looking my way. Some were asking questions. And a couple hours later, I realized why.

The guards had filled the hole in the bench and taken something. Something that was a big enough deal to get one of the guys carried off to solitary, and his crew was mad enough not to hide their weapons anymore. And soon enough, a lot of them were looking my way.

That’s why Pot had said what he did. He couldn’t get to me directly, so he went the other way. His boss must’ve chewed him out *bad*.

 

I was turned into a sort of pariah overnight. Marco stopped talking to me, and people distanced themselves. Didn’t matter what I said; I already had the target on my back. You can’t talk your way out of that. Talking to the guards is just digging your grave deeper, and faster. You gotta keep to yourself, be smart, and hope it goes away.

I tried a couple of things. I joined a sort of study group to get some name recognition. Most folks stick to themselves, but just showing your face enough can make them hesitant to put a fist through it. That, or maybe I could get my foot in the door of a proper crew. I could use the protection.

Problem was, I was already blacklisted. It wasn’t worth it for any one group to single-handedly break the peace. I was no one to them, why would they care?

 

The final wake-up call came one night just before lockdown. Marco wasn’t back yet. I was in my top bunk, reading a cheap crime thriller. All of a sudden, there’s a guy in the doorway, leaning against the frame. There are two more guys behind him. He’s smiling, but there’s no joy in it. It’s empty.

“Which side’s your favorite?” he asked.

“Which what?”

“Which side’s your favorite? You a leftie or righty?”

I held my book with my right hand. Before I could answer, he nodded.

“Righty. Well, then I’m gonna do you a favor.”

I didn’t say anything. I just shuffled back a little.

“We don’t want you running off, so we’re cutting up a lung. I figured you could pick which side to keep, yeah?”

I didn’t say a thing. Don’t ask questions, keep your head down. Anything I did would just make it worse.

“We’ll poke out your left one, you get to keep the right. I’m good like that.”

He was about to take a step through the door when someone mumbled something. That joyless smile looked away, then back at me.

“See you soon.”

He tapped the door and walked off.

 

I had to do something. I couldn’t sit around and wait to get stabbed to death, so… I started exploring some options. I thought maybe I could get transferred, but not on short notice. I could get put in solitary, but that was just a countdown until they got another shot at stabbing me. I considered snitching, but that would make more enemies. They’d have to put me with the sex criminals.

I don’t want to say Marco and I were friends, but we talked sometimes. I didn’t ask him for any advice, but he had some to give either way. Once, as I drifted off to sleep, I heard him mumble.

“You ought to look for Heywood.”

“Who’s Heywood?”

“He got out.”

“What do you mean?”

“He got out, man. He’s gone.”

“How’d he do it?”

“No one knows. Maybe you can figure it out.”

 

A prison break wasn’t on my list, but I didn’t know what else to do. It wasn’t so much about getting out as it was about making it another day. I might not even do it but having it in my back pocket could turn out to be an actual life saver.

I didn’t have a lot of friends in there, but there were a couple of folks I could drop a name to without getting angry looks. I asked around about Heywood, and most folks had no idea who I was talking about. For a while, I thought Marco was messing with me. There was this old guy running the kitchen who knew everybody, and he just waved me off. Maybe he didn’t know Heywood – or maybe he didn’t wanna say.

I figured out a couple of things. Heywood used to have a cell on the top floor of the D-block, for example. He was from South Dakota and had been in for murder. The details were sketchy, but most folks figured he died. Others weren’t so sure, and the rumor that he got out wasn’t just a figment of Marco’s imagination.

But I wasn’t getting anywhere, and I could see the guy with the empty smile roaming the hallways. Now that I knew he was coming, I stuck to the public areas. It wouldn’t save me forever, and I could see him and his crew circling me like sharks, but it bought me some time. But man, I don’t know what’s worse – waiting for pain or getting it.

 

I remember sitting down in a corner, plucking at my hair. It’s this thing I do when I’m stressed, leaving me with a bald spot next to my ear. It was bad. I’d lost weight, and I couldn’t stop doing that leg-shaking thing. I kept trying to get a spot in the corners to keep my back clear. It worked most of the time, but every now and then they’d sneak up on me and psych me out.

That is, until one of the old guys stopped at my table.

He had this shoulder-length gray hair and a scruffy beard that stood out to the sides. He had these tired green eyes that seemed to look straight through me. He sat down across from me, crossed his arms, and waited. We just sat there for a while. I was on the edge and couldn’t stand the silence, so I was the first to speak.

“What you want?”

“You been askin’ about me,” he said. “Here I am.”

“Askin’ about who?”

“Heywood,” he said. “I’m Heywood. I’m in jail for murder.”

“You’re Heywood?”

“Yeah.”

I threw my hands up in surrender. For someone who got out, he sure as hell was very much still in jail.

“They said you got out.”

“Yeah,” he nodded. “About six years ago.”

“Don’t look like it from here.”

“I came back.”

I raised an eyebrow at him, but he didn’t budge.

“I killed a woman,” he said. “I told you; I’m a murderer. Murderers ought to be in jail.”

“Look, I don’t care what you did. Do you know how to get out?”

“Yeah, but you don’t want that. You did something bad, so you should be in jail too.”

 

I tried to explain my problem. A misunderstanding with a CO, a couple of guys getting the wrong idea at the wrong time. I don’t think Heywood cared for the details, but he could see I was stressed about it. He was looking at my bald spot and my hand kept drifting to it. Maybe he didn’t know whether or not I deserved this, but he knew one thing for sure; I was in trouble. That was enough to get me some sympathy.

“It’s not easy,” he explained. “It’s gonna cost a lot. Might even cost you your life. You prepared to risk it just for a shot at getting out?”

“I dunno,” I admitted. “But I need the option. Things could get bad.”

“This isn’t a half-assed walk in the park kind of deal,” Heywood explained. “You do this, there ain’t no going back.”

“You did though. You went back.”

“It’s not like that,” he said, shaking his head. “If you want to do this, you gotta commit.”

I sighed and leaned back in my rickety plastic chair. Heywood kept his eyes locked to mine.

“Alright,” I said. “What you want for it?”

“If you get out, you’ll deliver something for me. Deal?”

“Deal.”

We shook on it. We decided we’d meet up after dinner and talk about details. We didn’t say a place, but he promised he’d find me either way.

 

When Heywood met up with me, I’d forgotten all about him. He pulled me aside and took me back to his cell in D-block. He didn’t have a cellmate, and the whole place was decorated like a small apartment. It barely even looked like a cell; he had his own covers, a couple of paintings, a small bookshelf… way more than I’d seen anyone being allowed to bring in.

“You friends with the warden?” I asked.

“They don’t ask a lot of questions,” he said. “I think they forgot I’m still here.”

He had this snow globe right next to his bed with a big plastic hand giving me the finger. It was signed with a silver pen. Maybe Kid Rock?

“You ever been to Hilltop?” Heywood asked. “It’s this small town in the middle of fucking nowhere. Shit town, shit people, but way off the radar.”

I shook my head.

“I was there a lot,” he continued. “Not sure why. Maybe family.”

“You’re not sure you got family?”

He didn’t answer.

 

Heywood brought out a handful of notes from his bookshelf. A couple of sketches, portraits, some pictures. Half a church, a bouquet of blue sunflowers, a black-and-white photo of a river. Finally, there was a piece of paper with a square drawn with charcoal. He handed it to me.

“Hold this.”

He taped the picture of the river on the wall. Right next to it, the sketch of the sunflowers. One by one, he put it all on the wall, while I stood there holding that paper with the black square. Heywood gave me a gentle push, asking me to step back. There was a chair at the back of his cell with a straight view of all the items he’d put up.

“This is all one place,” he said. “Not too far from Hilltop. This is all impressions of that place and what it’s like. You get it?”

“You making a fucking mood board?”

“No, I’m teaching you, you fucking ingrate. You get it or not?”

“I get it,” I sighed. “It’s a mood board.”

“You can call it a fucking Christmas tree for all I care. Now, sit here, and do one thing. Look at the square. Then look at the wall. Try to imagine what it looks like. Not just from the front, but all angles. Do this over, and over, and over.”

“What’s the point?”

“Are you gonna ask questions, or are you gonna do it?”

I rolled my eyes. Heywood waved me off.

“I’m getting a coffee,” he said. “I’ll be back in an hour.”

“You gonna leave me here for an hour?”

“No one’s gonna find you here. Now get to it.”

 

I tried to do as he told me. I looked down at the square, then back up at the pictures. I tried to imagine what that place was like. I could imagine swaying trees, a rushing river, and those sunflowers dancing in the wind. But I couldn’t get past the square. It didn’t fit the picture. Every time I looked back at it, I couldn’t help but frown. For some reason, it bothered me. Time and time again I found my hand drifting up to the side of my head, picking at the hairs by my ear.

It wasn’t just a drawing. It was a sensation, like I was feeling something *through* whoever drew it. Like I had a hand on the pen. I could feel something cold running from their hands, all the way into mine. I could tell they’d been worried. Scared, even. I imagined them looking up, and where there ought to be something else, it was just… *black*. The kind of black that not even charcoal can paint.

After a while, I wasn’t looking up at the wall anymore. I was just staring at that black square, imagining it as this void eating away at the light in my eyes.

 

Then, someone snapped their fingers at me. I hadn’t even noticed Heywood coming back.

“It’s been two hours,” he said. “You alright?”

“What the hell is this?”

“It’s this… thing. If you follow the river, and look in the right spot, you can see it.”

“But what is it?”

“Fuck if I know. But I know it’s there. You don’t forget that kind of thing.”

He tapped the paper.

“I drew that,” he continued. “I wanted to get it out of my head for a bit, but… I dunno. Now it just has more places to live.”

“And you don’t know what it is?”

“Never figured that out.”

He picked the paper from my hand and stuffed it away in his notes. For some reason, I felt relieved. He let out a sigh of relief.

“If you wanna get out, you’re gonna need to learn more about it. And you gotta be ready to move.”

He had a couple of blank papers that he rolled up for me. Then he handed me some charcoal.

“Draw some squares of your own. Don’t think about it too much. Do it at night, when you’re tired. When you can barely keep your eyes open. That’s when you need to think.”

I took the papers and the charcoal. I barely understood what he was saying, but the way he said it made me keep my mouth shut. He wasn’t joking. It instilled this sort of confidence in me that, maybe, this would work. Somehow. You can’t get a snow globe from commissary, after all.

 

Coming back to my cell, I spent some time with those papers, drawing the same square over and over. After a while, I sort of imagined it from different angles. The color and shape were the same, but it was like… I could *picture* it. Not like a physical thing, but like a hole in the world. Like the sky itself had a dead pixel.

I ended up drawing it at least a dozen times, on both sides of the papers. Then I’d draw it again, covering the first image. And when the lights got cut for the night, I was still drawing in the dark. I didn’t need to see the paper to know it was there. And the more I drew it, the clearer it got. Even in the dark of night, I could see the black.

I could smell the summer wind in the bushes. I could hear the rustle of leaves, and the running water bubbling down the river. It’s like I was there, looking up at this immense… thing.

I don’t remember falling asleep. It wasn’t like *usual* sleep. I was already dreaming before my eyes were closed.

 

I woke up with my hands covered in charcoal. The papers were all over the floor. I didn’t notice at first, but Marco was already gone. Turns out, I’d missed roll call. But how was that possible? How could I miss it without being dragged out of bed? Hell, I’d seen people get stuck in solitary for less.

I’d missed breakfast. It was closer to lunch time. Most folks were out in the yard, leaving the block almost empty. I didn’t get many steps out of my cell before a CO spotted me and escorted me outside, stopping only to let me wash my hands.

The moment I got to the yard, I could tell something was up. People were stepping away from me, and the guy with the empty smile wouldn’t look away. He tapped the left side of his chest with his pinky finger and licked his lips, nodding at me. Another guy tapped his wrist, as if showing a wristwatch that wasn’t there. The message was clear. Time was up.

 

As we left the yard, a hand grabbed my arm and pulled me aside. My first instinct was to fight, but a quick ‘hush’ shut me up. I hadn’t even noticed Heywood walking up to me, but there he was.

“Did it work?” he asked. “Did you see it?”

“I don’t know what the hell I saw.”

“Close enough.”

He took me down the hallway, right past a CO. The guy didn’t even look our way. For some reason, people just didn’t pay attention to Heywood. It’s like he wasn’t really there, in a way. We made it all the way back to his cell, where he handed me a small canvas bag of charcoal.

“I thought we had more time, but I saw those guys looking your way,” he said. “We’re doing this now.”

He tapped his hand on the wall.

“Draw it,” he continued. “Draw it all over, and don’t stop until you run out of black.”

“And then what?”

“Then you can get out.”

He picked something up from under his pillow; a yellowed envelope. Stamped and addressed but never sent. My part of the deal.

“You get out, you deliver that. Then we’re square.”

“How is this gonna get me out?” I asked.

“You want me to explain it, or do you want to do it?”

There was no discussion. Heywood turned to leave, but stopped in the doorway. He unrolled a receipt from his pocket and jotted something down. He put it in the letter and handed it to me. I got to work.

 

I spent all day drawing the wall a solid black. It wasn’t just about the color, it was also the texture. I used my hands to smooth out the lines, trying to make it all blend into a single solid. I couldn’t wrap my head around it, but the way I imagined it, it wasn’t just about making a black wall – it was a lack of color. I wasn’t painting something black as much as I was removing light.

But I couldn’t figure out what it was supposed to be. It was easier to figure out what it wasn’t. Not a place. Not a real thing. Not a vision. It was something, and it had a shape, but it was also… nothing. Something impossible, resting by a river in the middle of nowhere.

I got *really* into it. Hours passed, and no one came looking for me. And finally, after staring myself blind at the same dark space, I felt something. I could *push* it. Not with force, but by picturing it further away. Like I was trying to reach where it *really* was.

I could see the cell stretch and extend, as if shaping into a tunnel. Reaching. It was… unsettling. My stomach kept turning, like I was being pushed back by a great force. I bent over and hurled. I almost pissed myself right then and there. And when I looked up, it was just a messy wall.

 

When I left Heywood’s cell, I had a raging migraine. I could barely stand. I had to try and find him, but my eyes kept getting crossed and I would get my feet mixed up. I ended up falling over and almost tumbling down the catwalk. Luckily, someone lent me a shoulder to lean on. They sat me down on a chair, balancing me against the wall, and the friendly shoulder moved up to look me in the eye.

The man with the empty smile, with a shiv on full display.

“Man, what the fuck did you get into?” he asked. “You dying to see the nurse already?”

I tried to tell him I wasn’t feeling well. My eyes kept getting crossed, and it felt like the space in the room was extending. It’s like the world kept tipping over, and I was holding on for dear life.

“We’ll get you to the nurse,” he grinned. “You just need a good reason. A *real* good reason.”

And with that, they dragged me off.

 

I think I was in the showers. There was a cold floor and ceramic tiles. The fluorescent lights burned like phosphor, making the shadows sharper, longer, and darker. In a way, I was thankful to be sitting down. It was easier to keep my balance. To not *fall*, whatever that meant.

The man came back with a sharpened toothbrush. Two of his guys waited by the door, making small talk with someone just outside. This was gonna be a one-man job, and I was the recipient. I bet my left testicle they were talking to Potbelly.

“Can’t believe they got you to snitch,” the smiling man said. “This place is gonna be my home for the next eight years. I want it *clean*, you see? And if we wanna keep it *clean*, we can’t have no fucking *rats* running around, yeah?”

I wanted to talk. To explain myself, somehow. But all I could do was roll my eyes, trying to find an angle where the light didn’t burn my brain.

 

As he gently placed the sharpened end of the toothbrush against my ribcage, I felt something strange. I gave up. I grabbed onto the man for stability, ignoring what he was about to do. He was my *support* \- then I lost my balance. Despite leaning against a solid wall, I fell *backwards*.

The world turned, and I dragged this man along. I smacked the back of my head into a concrete floor as the lights shifted, turning from fluorescent to a distant moonlight. It’s like, I listened. I *felt* it. And the touch of that black wall was closer than ever. I heard a wheezing voice coming from beside me as I let go of the man with the shiv.

He was muttering ‘what the fuck’ under his breath, over and over and over. I turned my head his way, relieved to feel the pressure in the back of my head release. Maybe I was just bleeding. The fire in my mind was cooling, coating my soul in a soothing balm.

 

I sat up. We were in this long concrete corridor, like the prison wall had opened into a tunnel. It stretched on for as long as my eyes could see, and at the very far end, I could see a black dot. Something I’d seen before, in the drawings.

“There,” I muttered, choking back an acidic gulp escaping my stomach. “Gotta go there.”

I reached my hand out. I imagined running my hand across the surface of the black wall. And the more I thought about it, the closer I got. It wasn’t moving me; we were collapsing our positions. It was closing the distance between us to mimic the space in my mind. I was trying to touch it, and it was letting me. From horizon to hand.

Then, I was standing in front of it.

 

I remember placing my hand on it. It was so cold that it burned me, but in another way, I didn’t feel a thing. It didn’t hurt.

The man with the shiv put his hands to it as well. I could see his eyes go blank as he tried to figure out what was happening.

“It’s not a dream,” he mumbled. “Not a nightmare. It’s not a-“

He stuttered, fumbling for the words. Looking down, I remembered the letter Heywood had given me. For a moment, I let go of the wall. In the blink of an eye, I could see so much more. I was standing knee-deep in a slow river, surrounded by a verdant forest. I could see the blue sunflowers from Heywood’s drawing by the riverbank.

The receipt fell out of the letter, tumbling into my hands. I almost dropped it.

“You are Ridgey,” it read,” you were in jail for insurance fraud. You are delivering a letter.”

I read it aloud, then I read it again. It was telling the truth. The man with the shiv didn’t have that kind of truth told; he knew nothing. It’s like the wall had emptied his mind, making him roll the same words in his head over, and over, and over. Repeating what was *not* happening, trying to find an answer to what had.

He couldn’t step away, but I did. He stood there, counting out loud all the things this wasn’t. Not a this. Not a that. His shiv got swept up in the river.

 

I held the letter close and tore myself away. I wandered in a haze until I found a path, leading me to a road. A couple of drivers honked at me. Probably because of the jumpsuit. I would stop at times, forgetting what the hell I was doing. Then I’d look down at the note, and read it aloud.

I was Ridgey. I was in jail for insurance fraud. I was delivering a letter.

After a while, cars stopped honking. It’s like they didn’t see me anymore. I would check the address on the letter and check the street signs. I tried asking a passer-by for directions, but they just looked at me and kept walking.

I think I found the place after a while. The house had been abandoned for decades. But I did as I’d been told and left the yellow letter on the doorstep.

 

I didn’t know what to do next. I was out of jail. I tried to remember what got me there, but it was all fading away. I got these little glimpses, like someone cutting me out of a deal and getting me put in jail. There were faces that I’d seen a million times, but I couldn’t remember their names. Maybe one of them was a mom, or a dad, but they might as well have been an uncle, or an older sister. I didn’t know. I was fading into the dark, along with that thing by the river.

I tried to talk to a guy at the supermarket. I asked him where I was. He looked me in the eye, excused himself, and went back to whatever he was doing. It’s like he saw right through me. I ended up grabbing a handful of Cheetos and walking out of there. I dropped one of the bags by the door. Turning around, I saw him pick it up and putting it back on the shelf – he didn’t even care to look my way.

I had to look back at my note over and over, reminding myself. I was Ridgey. I’d been in jail for insurance fraud. The note said I was delivering a letter, but I’d already done that. But I was forgetting that too. I had to do something, so I ripped the note in half. Maybe there was something else on it at some point – I don’t know.

Now, I was Ridgey. I was in jail for insurance fraud. That was it.

 

The more I thought about it, the more it was true. I think I wandered for a while. I had a glass of wine at some point. Then I felt this pressure building in my head again, and there was a corridor, and… I remember the guy, too. He was still standing there. His hand looked strange, and his words had turned into this slurred mess. The way you repeat something until it sounds more like a noise than a word.

I held onto that note like it was the final breath of air before a deep plunge. I walked until I saw that dark thing by the river. But I read the note, again, and again, and I turned my back on it. I was Ridgey. I was in jail for insurance fraud.

And I walked.

 

At some point, I passed a gate. Then I passed a security check. No one looked in my pockets. Hell, I was still holding my bag of Cheetos. My legs gave out, and when my eyes came to, I was having lunch. Right across from me was Heywood, looking me in the eye. It was different this time. I could see he wasn’t just tired – he was empty. He looked at the bold spot on the side of my head. I didn’t reach for it. I haven’t since. I kinda miss it.

“I’m Heywood, and I’m in jail for murder,” he said.

“I’m Ridgey. I’m in jail for insurance fraud,” I answered.

It wasn’t an introduction. We were *reassuring* one another. Reminding ourselves. We had been out there, by that thing, and it had burned away something we’d taken for granted. If we’d known each other from before, maybe we could have kept something more. But no – I got a name, and charge, and place. It’s simple, but it’s all I got. He’s the same.

 

I walk these halls doing whatever the hell I want. Maybe I can say I’m someone or something else, but I can’t risk it. I can’t lose myself, like that… smiling man. I don’t want to get stuck like that. I think I knew his name at some point. Maybe he lost it.

I’ve tried not to remind myself, but I can feel something slipping away when I stop reminding myself. There are so many things I’ve let go of, and I can’t even remember why I mourn them. But it gets easier when things are simple and clear. I’m Ridgey, that’s simple. I’m in jail. That’s clear.

People forget Heywood and I are here. We talk to people sometimes, but they forget all about it shortly after. Sometimes writing it down holds their attention a little longer, but it always fades. I once straight up slapped Potbelly across the face. It earned me a whack and a shove, but then he just walked away like nothing happened. He had a bruise all week.

Heywood and I play some games, talk about whatever details we remember. I’ve made a note of things I’m certain of, or that he’s told me. That’s what I’ve used to write all this down. I’m sure I got some details wrong though.

 

I try not to think about this. When I do, I can feel my mind getting dragged away. It’s not a matter of space, it’s a matter of being *aware*. The more you think about it, the more you see it. And if you look close enough, I think you can still see a man standing there, counting the many things he isn’t.

Or maybe he’s gone by now. I don’t wanna look.

I don’t know if all I’ve told you is the truth. My stomach turns when I think about how much might be wrong, or misremembered. I don’t want to think about it. I just read my note, and I let that *be me*. Even if it isn’t. I have to keep it simple. I have to keep it clear.

The protagonist and her guy best friend (not the former priest) have a superstition that the other can’t die owing the other a coffee.

So it’s probably rough as heck. I can’t even say for certain if I’ll carry on with it. I have a whole story outlined, but haven’t written much out beyond this. Let me know what you think. 

Frank Halverson reached back and thumbed his gas mask. Like the Liberty truck he was driving, it was Great War surplus. Unlike the truck he was driving, it was still good enough to get the job done.

 

“Boss shoulda scrapped this piece of shit years ago”, he thought. Instead he was taking this lumbering, cab-less hulk up the North Shore Highway on the last frigid run of the season while the boss’s idiot son drove the new GMC around town on legitimate business.

 

At least the cops wouldn’t bother him. No self-respecting bootlegger would be hauling hooch at 15mph.  Actually, Frank didn’t know what he was hauling today. He didn’t keep in the boss’s good graces by asking too many questions. He just knew that normally he’d be heading north empty and heading back to Duluth with barrels full of Canada’s third finest whiskey, cleverly stashed inside hollowed out logs he had some timber men make for him.

 

“Lou”, he said.

 

No answer.

 

“Hey, LOU”, a little louder.

 

A groan elicited from the heavily bundled up passenger. How Lou managed to fall asleep in this 5-ton, clattery buckboard, Frank was never able to figure out. Still, he was good company. Lou Novak had been with Frank since Chateau-Thierry. 4 years they fought together, Reims, Metz, 3rd Battle of Verdun. Back and forth across a few miles of French mud.

 

Somehow Lou had found away to be able to fall asleep whenever they had a free moment. Or at least, Frank had to kick him awake more than once when a new  Lieutenant would want to inspect the boys.

 

“Whaddya need Hook?” Lou grumbled.

 

“I’m gonna stop at the roadside here for a sandwich and a coffee. No way we’re making Betty’s before she closes for the night”

 

“Yeah, alright. I could use a cup.”

 

—

 

Frank piloted the big truck into the gravel lot of Arvo’s Gas. Arvo’s wasn’t a cafe in the strictest sense, but his wife, Lena, always kept a pot of coffee on at their cottage next door and she usually had a few sandwiches for hungry drivers. If you behaved yourself, she’d even let you eat on the porch. 

 

“Wasn’t expecting anyone else tonight,” called out Arvo as Frank eased the big truck up to the pump. “Radio says there’s a storm coming in, S’posed to be a big fog following it.”

 

“We heard, but I gotta get these supplies up to Two Harbors before the Kincaid ships out” answered Frank.

 

A lie, sure, but Arvo didn’t need to know that the supplies wouldn’t be boarding the S.S.Thomas R. Kincaid in Two Harbors. You don’t tell the gas man that you’d be clandestinely meeting a shore boat further up coast just because his wife made a good bologna and cheese and bad coffee.

 

“Has Lena still got a pot on?”

 

“Sure does, might be a little stale by now”

 

“Fill ‘er up for me?”

 

“Sure Frank”

 

With that, Frank and Lou strolled next door.

—

“Whaddya think of Tommy?” asked Lou as he finished the last of his sandwich.

“I think the boss shoulda pulled out.”

“Nah, I mean what do you think he’s been up to lately?  He’s been spending more time ‘round the yard, keeps getting in the way.”

“I think he’s trying to get the boss to up his allowance,” Frank sneered.  “Maybe he’s got a girl down in the cities.  He’s been going down there most weekends.  Lord knows, none of the gals in the West End will have him.”

With that, they finished their coffee, said their goodbyes to Lena and walked back to the truck.  Lou stepped in to the garage to settle up with Arvo for the gas while Frank went to check the load on the truck.  He spotted a Model T parked behind the abandoned tar paper shack across the highway.  “No reason to get alarmed,” he thought “probably just squatters.”  The iron range was full of new transplants, some driven out of their homes by the fog, most looking for work in the mines.  It wasn’t uncommon to see scores of hard luck folks on their way north, in search of prosperity feeding the metropolitan dome projects.  Still, Frank decided to move the shotgun from under the seat where it sat with some surplus first-aid packets and a satchel of thermite.

“Lou, why don’t you drive for a bit?”

—

 

“Does that look like a tin lizzie to you?” Frank asked.

“Yeah, why?”

“Saw one back at Arvo’s.  This one has been following us for 20 minutes.” 

The road had been quiet since they left the gas station.  The only car they’d seen, a newer dark blue Essex had passed them just outside Two Harbors. It had vanished up the road, the 60mph Super Six unwilling to stay stuck behind their 15mph truck.  But this car had stayed back, never closer than a quarter mile.  Frank checked that the m1897 was loaded and saw that Lou had loosened up the broomhandle Mauser he kept inside his coat. 

“We should have Thompsons for this,” said Lou.

He was right.  Normally the shotgun was enough to deter any squatters that might get too close to the truck, and it raised fewer eyebrows amongst the local law.  Normally, the reputation of the boss was enough for any serious outfit to leave them alone. Normally, he’d just be hauling booze instead of whatever was in the crates.  But it looked like tonight was shaping up to be anything but normal.

The road up the north shore had been new just a few years prior, cut into the hills along the coast of Lake Superior.  Sometimes breaking free of the forest to round a cliff face or cross a ravine, just long  enough for the moonlight and icy lake wind to touch them, then diving back into the darkness of the pines.  If the old truck had been able to go faster than a run, the headlights would never have been enough.   Which is why it was pure luck that they spotted the car so early. 

A dark blue Essex sedan was parked, blocking the road at the far side of a tall bridge over a narrow ravine. 

“OVER!” Frank shouted, as Lou was already standing on the brake and hauling the truck hard right, off the edge of the narrow concrete highway.

That’s when he heard the “Bam-bam-bam-bam” of automatic fire.  Frank leapt out of the truck, shotgun in hand before it had even stopped, then came the quick staccato “ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta” of a Thompson and the thuds of the bullets hitting the wood sides of the truck.  He peeked over the truck to see the Essex flip on its lights as they started advancing forward.

Bam-bam-bam-bam!

Tatatatatata!

Bam-bam-bam-bam!

The two automatic wielders were alternating bursts to keep his head down.  He was sure they were calmly advancing on the rapidly disintegrating truck too.  Just like they taught at rifleman school.  Wood splinter shrapnel was flying off the bed and he knew that it was mostly just luck and the cast iron engine block that had kept him from taking a bullet.

Bam-bam-

The heavy automatic had emptied its magazine and Frank knew that he had half a heartbeat before the gunner with the Thompson would adjust the rhythm.  He got up and lunged off the road, blindly aiming the shotgun over the truck in the general direction of the headlights and firing, racking the pump without bothering to let off the trigger. He landed beside a granite outcropping to find Lou.

“They got a B.A.R.,” said Lou.

“Yup.  You were right.  We should have Thompsons for this.”

Frank looked down and saw Lou sitting next to the satchel of thermite and holding his gut. 

“Shit Lou, you shoulda grabbed the bandages, not the bomb.”

“Wouldn’t have made a difference, Hook, I’m leaking pretty bad here,” Lou winced. “And it’s not a bomb.  It’s the distraction so you can leave.”

“Lou.”

“Just cover me so I can plant the charge.”

Bam-Bam-Bam-Bam!

Tatatatatata!

The attackers had barely been phased by his wild shotgun blasts and were now back to their walking-fire advance on the truck.  Alternating between the snap of the bullets hitting their boulder and the thud of the rounds punching through the old truck.  But now there was another noise, the clatter of a Model T.

“Looks like the chase car is here,” Lou groaned as he staggered to his feet.

Frank peered out past the edge of the boulder and was surprised to see the Essex was down to one headlight.  He couldn’t see gunmen past the bright light, but the muzzle flashes gave him a rough idea where they were. After a moment’s cursing that he didn’t grab any extra shells, he dropped the empty shotgun and pulled his revolver from inside his coat.

“When you’re ready, Lou”

Lou inhaled and half shouted “Now!”

At that, Frank leaned out from behind the rock and fired, slowly, steadily in the direction of the muzzle flashes.  He wasn’t likely to hit them with his snubnose .38 at this distance, but he just needed to make Lou an opening. Then he heard the pop-pop-pop of Lou’s Mauser pistol and knew he was trying to give the goons in the Model T a reason to duck.  Lou got a foot up on the back wheel of the truck and heaved himself up onto the bed.  Frank loaded a fresh set of shells into his revolver and took aim at the Model T, his back to the boulder.

Bam-bam-bam!

The BAR fire raked the rock behind him. Frank almost smiled when the Thompson didn’t fill in the gaps.  Lou was getting his feet under him to set the charge on the largest crate when Frank started squeezing off shots at the no longer advancing Model T, only to see the doors open and silhouettes pile out into the darkness, guns readied.

Bam-bam-bam-bam!

Another B.A.R. opened up from the direction of the chase vehicle.  Frank instinctively dove for cover in the roadside ditch.  Looking up he saw Lou had gotten the magnesium fuse lit. Lou jumped down from the truck, stumbled and regained his feet for a moment before Frank saw him get spun as something hit Lou in the midsection.  In a moment he’d crumpled, slumped down into a sitting position.  White-hot fire pouring out of the crates behind him as the thermite flared.

“I think I’m gonna stay here,” he called out dryly, “You oughta get going.”

“Thanks Lou” 

 Frank emptied his revolver in the direction of the Model T and ran up the hill behind him.  The blaze of the four thousand degree thermite creating a devilish array of shadows on the rocks and pines that helped hide him as he clambered up the slope.  When he reached the top he looked back at the scene below.  Six men flanked the truck, two with B.A.R.s and three with Thompsons, the last one holding his side.

“Got one of you bastards,” Frank said to himself.

The largest crate was entirely consumed by the fire.  Through the flames he could make out the same distinctive profile of the M-2 Assault Walker. The type that he’d followed across a half dozen no-mans lands in the war.  That thing wasn’t surplus, none of the walkers were allowed in civilian hands.  That was a highly regulated government weapon. He had heard stories of Army Intelligence disappearing people that were trying to sell training manuals for M-2s, and here he had been sitting on what looked like a complete unit.  Lou was still sitting next to it.  It looked like he was trying to light one last cigarette.

A figure strode over to Lou from the direction of the Essex, raised a large revolver to his head and fired.",2,1770423190.0,Dieselpunks,3,1.0,False

I am a little **perplexed** about this - there are at least one (I think it's one and her friend) narc doing this weird thing - they **spy** on me, through observations from the people who live with me (it's a shared living) and through some more intrusive listening mechanisms.

Then they take this information and **make use** of it, and there are several examples:  
\- They heard I have a routing of drinking coffee in the morning, and that I go to some library to get free printing, and then in a webinar they say ""yeah people can come in, we have free coffee, and we have free printing too"".

\- They heard a random chat I had with a 80 year old guy, and it was kind of a ""ha ha women do this and that"", nothing malicious or disrespectful. A day later I got a message from a man living with me pulling me aside saying ""oh you can't talk like that, women will sue you for harassment nowadays"" ..., as if I talked to one of those women.

\- They heard me get excited about a deaf and limited abled boy being good at music, and then day later I get a message to look at ""big brother of america"".

\- They hear I am looking at a list of events and decide whether to show up based on description and then the next week suddenly the list (which had no descriptions) suddenly shows descriptions which coincide with what they think I would find relevant/interesting.

**Can someone explain it to me**? What exactly is this, why would someone do this? and how do I fight it? Do I even need to fight it? Should I say ""stop spying on me?"" It's insane someone keeps tabs on me. Am I just too shy to handle all this extra attention?

**PS 1** I know many people want to respond negatively to this, still if you can try and take a high road and try to either be **positive or explanatory or action oriented** \- I'd appreciate it.

**PS 2** I'd add that this is in a professional/work related context, not a romantic context. Also, this person (and her friend) and in a position of a bit of power - they can make things hard or easy, for me and others, and I am a bit of an underdog to them.

**PS 3** Some days I am so angry for the invasion to my privacy, and some days I am so ""I think you guys are trying to help me, but there is no need - I got this"", so it distracts me.

It's always ""be the life of the party!"" or ""approach 50 strangers!"" Like... that's not how we operate. And honestly? It's exhausting pretending to be someone we're not.

I've spent the last year diving deep into this, reading everything from Susan Cain's research to podcasts by actual behavioral psychologists. Not because I'm broken, but because I wanted to understand how attraction actually works for people like us. Turns out, introverts have a completely different toolkit for magnetism, and when you lean into it instead of fighting it, you become way more compelling than any loud personality in the room.

Here's what I learned from books, research, and way too many hours of youtube deep dives.

**The ""mysterious"" thing is real, but not how you think**

People are drawn to depth. When you're not constantly broadcasting every thought, people actually get curious. It's not about playing games or being aloof on purpose. It's about the natural pause you create before speaking. That pause makes people lean in.

Matthew Hussey (relationship coach with millions of followers) talks about this in his youtube videos. He calls it ""intentional presence."" You don't need to dominate conversations. You need to make your words count. Quality over quantity isn't just a cliche, it's literally how our brains are wired as introverts.

Try this: In your next conversation, wait two full seconds before responding. It feels weird at first but it signals that you're actually thinking, not just waiting for your turn to talk. People find that incredibly attractive because it's so rare.

**One on one is your secret weapon**

Group settings drain us. But one on one? That's where we shine. Lean into this hard.

I started using the Ash app for relationship coaching and one insight completely changed my perspective. The coach mentioned that intimacy (not sexual, just connection) happens in private spaces. Introverts naturally excel at creating those moments. We ask better questions. We remember details. We make people feel truly seen.

Instead of trying to work the entire room at a party, focus on having one genuinely good conversation. That person will remember you way longer than anyone remembers the guy doing shots on the table.

**Your listening skills are genuinely powerful**

This sounds like generic advice but hear me out. Most people are terrible listeners. They're just waiting to talk. You? You actually process what people say.

Research from Harvard Business School shows that good listeners are consistently rated as more attractive, more trustworthy, and more leadership material. It's a skill most people fake but introverts naturally possess.

Active listening means asking follow up questions that show you retained information. ""Wait, didn't you mention last week that..."" People lose their minds when you remember small details about their lives. It signals that they matter to you.

**Build a rich internal world (then share glimpses)**

Attractiveness isn't just about how you interact, it's about who you are when nobody's watching. Develop genuine interests. Read weird books. Learn obscure skills. Have opinions about things.

I picked up ""The Introvert Advantage"" by Marti Olsen Laney (she's a psychotherapist who's done groundbreaking research on introvert brain chemistry). This book made me realize that our internal processing isn't a bug, it's a feature. We think deeply about things. That depth is magnetic when you learn to express it.

There's also BeFreed, an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni that's been useful for this exact kind of growth. You tell it your specific goal, like ""become more magnetic as an introvert,"" and it pulls from psychology books, dating expert insights, and relationship research to create a custom learning plan just for you. What stood out was how it tailors everything to your personality and challenges, not generic extrovert advice. You can customize the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something really clicks. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, I went with the smoky, confident tone that somehow makes learning about social dynamics way more engaging during my commute.

Share your interests selectively. When someone asks what you did this weekend, instead of ""nothing much,"" try ""I got really into researching Byzantine architecture"" or whatever genuinely interests you. Passion is attractive. Weirdly specific passion is even more attractive because it's authentic.

**Your energy management isn't selfishness**

Here's something nobody tells you. Setting boundaries around your social energy makes you more attractive, not less. When you're not forcing yourself into situations that drain you, you show up better in situations that matter.

The Finch app (it's a habit building thing with a cute bird companion) helped me track my energy levels and plan accordingly. I stopped saying yes to everything and started being selective. Result? I was way more present and engaging in the interactions I did have.

People respect clarity. ""I need to recharge tonight but I'd love to grab coffee Thursday"" is way more attractive than showing up somewhere and being a zombie.

**Develop your aesthetic quietly**

Attractiveness has visual components, obviously. But introverts approach this differently too. We're not peacocking for attention. We're curating.

Find a style that feels authentically you and refine it. Could be how you dress, how your space looks, how you present online. The key is consistency and intention. People notice when someone has a clear sense of self.

This isn't about expensive clothes or following trends. It's about looking like you made choices deliberately. Even if your aesthetic is ""minimalist tech person"" or ""dark academia wannabe,"" own it completely.

**Use text and writing to your advantage**

Introverts often communicate better in writing. Use that. Your dating profile, your texts, your emails, these are places where you can craft exactly what you want to say without the pressure of immediate response.

I started treating text conversations like an art form. Not overthinking every message, but being more thoughtful. Adding specific details. Asking questions that couldn't be answered with yes or no. The difference in response quality was wild.

**Find your platform**

You don't need to be attractive to everyone. You need to be attractive to the right people. That means putting yourself in environments where introvert qualities are valued.

Book clubs, niche hobby groups, small dinner parties, online communities around specific interests. These are places where depth beats volume every time. You're not trying to win over a crowd. You're trying to connect with individuals who appreciate what you bring.

**The confidence thing (but make it quiet)**

Confidence doesn't mean loud. It means secure. It means you know your worth even if you're not shouting about it.

Quiet confidence is: maintaining eye contact, speaking clearly (even if slowly), not apologizing for needing alone time, having strong opinions about things that matter to you, being comfortable with silence.

None of that requires you to become someone else. It just requires you to stop apologizing for being an introvert.

**Bottom line**

You don't need to become an extrovert to be attractive. You need to become a fully realized introvert. That means embracing the qualities that make you different, developing genuine depth, and showing up authentically in spaces where those qualities shine.

They have a history of feeling paranoid and somewhat delusional about them. it was incredibly bad for one month about a year ago. since then a lot has happened. they eventually got over the negative feelings and thoughts towards their friends. it was replaced by something else just as intense if not more concerning. Either way tldr they went to the deep end and got admitted, is out now, and taking meds. they have been getting a lot of professional support. As far as i can tell they are much much better than they were before.

But recently i asked how they were feeling and what they have been thinking about. They mentioned that these negative thoughts and feelings about this close friend has manifested again. I'll specify by saying that because they have gotten better, they've slowly started reintegrating themselves into their usual social circles. and that includes interaction with this friend. In one instance hanging out with this friend is fine. Everything is all cool. fast forward to a different day and my loved one now perceives these interactions to be negative. they believe the person is being passive aggressive and taunting or even threatening them indirectly. My loved one even emphasizes that some of the things their friend is saying are things the friend has said in the past but it was harmless in those scenarios but in this instance the tone is antagonistic and threatening. these unfavorable interactions with the friend has resulted in them ruminating about this. they are worried about the friend and what the friend might do to them.

I do not want them to fall back into paranoia and full delusional thinking again so i urge them to open up about this to their therapist. i gave them notes on a piece of paper as guidance of what to bring up so they don't jumble up their words or forget anything.

So the meeting comes along with the therapist and they open up about these concerns of theirs. my loved one tells me about it when they get back from the appointment. they mention how they opened up with a portion of the situation to the therapist. not everything, not the history, nor the behaviors of my loved one that one month a year ago when it was really bad. so the therapist does not have the entire context. Ultimately based on my loved one's words, the therapist told them that what their friend is doing is really toxic and they need to weigh their options of whether they want to stick around or distance themselves. In conclusion my loved one decided to distance themselves from these friend/friends.

\*disclaimer: i myself do not believe these things my loved one thinks are true. i do not think the friend is behaving the way they say the friend is behaving. i myself am on good terms with that friend and have known them for many years.

Now ultimately what i need advice on is:

1)how do i know my loved one is being truthful with me in terms of opening up to the therapist and truthful with me about the advice that was given to them by the therapist?

2)Should i ask my loved one if they really did open up to the therapist and if the therapist really said those things?

3)is distancing themselves from the people they are paranoid/delusional about the best course of action for my loved one?

the reason I'm iffy on this is because while i think the advice seems somewhat sensible considering i offered this advice months ago, it seems a bit simple and small for an advice regarding the situation. I'm just worried that either the therapist wasn't told much or they have misunderstood the circumstances.

3)Bonus Question: I have concerns about my loved one's coffee consumption in relation to their medication. They have steadily increased their caffeine intake from 1 to 2 to 3 and recently to 4 cups daily.  they take this much to combat the sedative and lethargic effects of their medication. one of them being olanzapine at 5mg. a previous therapist recommended 2 cups a day maximum. but in the last few months they've been so low energy that on several days at a time they could be bed ridden. but in the past month or so theyve decided to up their coffee. so they are awake all day and actually doing things. my issue is that theyve built a tolerance to 3 and have gone up to 4. so what next, theyll keep going up in coffee intake the more the tolerance goes up? on top of that, last week theyve been having trouble sleeping and have switched rooms to sleep. from bed to floor, to couch in living room. Now more recently this doctor mentioned that 4 cups is fine. i wasnt there so im not sure if the 4 cups daily  is okay or if going up to 4 cups on occasion is what is okay. What are your guys thoughts on 4 cups daily with these medications (olanzapine, Haldol, lithium, and i forgot what the 4th one is called).",3,1770422239.0,SchizoFamilies,0,1.0,False

1qxy63f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1qxy63f/my_black_panther_sighting/,My ‘black panther’ sighting,"  This happened a few years ago and I’ve never had the chance to bring it up with anyone. I was vacationing in Florida for a while, some touristy island with a few more equally touristy towns surrounding. This was my second to last day there. I was with my mom sitting in the car, waiting for my sibling in the coffee shop. I was staring off in the distance, when something caught my eye.

  It was about thirty feet away from us, the largest cat I had ever seen in my entire life. Solid black with a long tail swaying from side to side. The head even resembles that of a big cat, it was very distinct. Large claws that were pawing at the palm tree in front of it. Within seconds it scaled up the tree like it was nothing (most cats just do this normally).

  I was shocked, told my mom to look over. She was equally shocked and we were both a bit frightened considering that was a giant cat out in broad daylight. No I didn’t take a picture because we were going to move the car to get a closer look. Unfortunately, something spooked it and it ran off, so we weren’t able to. My sibling comes back and I tell them the entire thing.

  When I got home I looked it up out of curiosity, there was a sighting of what I described years ago in a town just twenty minutes outside of where I was staying. Now, Florida panthers do exist but are endangered. Melanistic Florida panthers pretty much don’t exist. I swore to you that did not in any way look like a housecat, but I know there’s no other explanation.",19,1770422102.0,BenignExistence,1,1.0,False
1qxy5vk,https://v.redd.it/lgwciyvspyhg1,"I built a 3D Ski Map that actually shows slope steepness because I kept getting lost on ""flat"" paper maps. It has AR navigation, Friend Tracking, and Backcountry drawing tools.","Hey r/SideProject!

I’ve been working on [**Bonvo.Ski**](http://Bonvo.Ski), an iOS app to replace those crumpled, wet paper maps we all struggle with on the mountain.

**The Problem:** Ski resorts are inherently 3D, but most maps are 2D static images. It's hard to tell if a ""Blue"" run is actually an easy cruise or a narrow cliff edge. Plus, finding friends usually involves taking off gloves to type texts.

**My Solution:** I built a custom 3D rendering engine that visualizes the terrain. Here is what makes it different from existing apps (Strava/Slopes):

* **Ultra Live Heading (AR):** You can double-tap your location to enter an AR mode. You point your phone, and it overlays amenities (restrooms, coffee, lifts) on the real world.
* **Slope Intelligence:** The app categorizes slopes by actual steepness % (Family vs. Advanced vs. Expert). No more accidentally ending up on a black diamond.
* **Backcountry Drawing:** For the free-riders, you can switch to ""Drawing Mode"" to markup the map with polygons and lines to plan your route or mark dangerous zones.
* **Offline First:** You can download the 3D data so it works when you have zero bars of signal.

**Just added:** I also included an **AI Character Generator** (turn your selfie into a slope cartoon) and a **Winter Olympics Schedule** tracker since the games are coming up!

**I’d love your feedback:** specifically on the ""Slope Ranking"" logic. Does sorting by steepness percentage feel useful to you?

**Free Codes for the Community:** I have a bunch of **1-Month Pro codes** to give away. If you want to test the AR or Offline maps, just drop a comment and I'll DM you one!

A while back, I was at work just casually scrolling on Grindr when a guy messaged me. I checked his profile and saw he had a photo with another man. Later I found out that man was his husband. I immediately knew what they were probably looking for. After a few messages, he confirmed it: they were in an open marriage and looking for a third guy for threesomes — not separate connections. I told him I wasn’t interested in that kind of setup.

But even after that, we kept talking.

Weeks went by, and we got along incredibly well. We started video calling almost every day, talking for hours about everything and nothing. It felt easy and natural. Then one day he asked if I’d like to meet — just the two of us — for a coffee somewhere.

I had a bad feeling, like this wouldn’t end well, but by then I already liked him so much that I said yes.

On our first meeting, nothing really happened physically. We shook hands, hugged goodbye, had coffee, talked, looked at each other in that quiet, loaded way. But that was the moment I realized I had fallen in love with him.

For months, this became our routine: meeting up, texting, video calls. He told me many times how unhappy he was, how he thought he’d feel better with me, how good we were together. That’s when I started feeling like the emotions weren’t just one-sided.

Then after one meeting, everything changed. He told me he needed some time and that we should stop meeting for a while. I respected that and pulled back too. Slowly, we drifted apart. Now we barely talk — sometimes a few words here and there, nothing more.

A bit about me: I always considered myself bisexual. I had girlfriends before and everything. But he was the person who made me truly realize — and accept — that I’m actually gay. In a way, he was my first real love.

This all happened in 2024. It’s now 2026, and I still can’t forget him or what we had. I’ve dated other guys since, but it never felt real. It’s like my heart is still tied to him.

Because Deathloop makes you play missions repeatedly in a time loop, I must have heard this song 500 times in my playthrough of Deathloop when the game first released (2021). The anti-women lyrics are seared into my brain and keep rising unbidden into my thoughts when I'm on dates:

>Sittin' in a bar  
there's this girl.  
She demands a smoke.  
Hey girl, you're a joke!

>Sippin' my whiskey

*you have no style,*  
*you have no respect, for me!""*

I was lying on the couch talking to my psychologist the other week. We were trying to pinpoint the reason why I was experiencing ""failure to launch"", was still single, and if I was ace or gay or not. It was a Eureka moment in my year-long therapy, when we realized it was because I was traumatized by Deathloop.

I can't get the game's song out of my head when I'm dating. So I feel physically and conversationally repulsed by women ""udders flowing out, red lips burn my eyes, you have no class"" and cannot commit to them. My dates consist of me being aghast internally criticizing every micro-action my date is doing on our coffee walk/bar meetup. I am conversationally repulsed, because it's very boring to talk to women unlike men. I don't know what the fix is. This is a massive source of stress for me, as my relatives are constantly pressuring me to give me their first child.

The rest of the Deathloop ""She has no class"" lyrics go:

1qxxtpj,https://i.redd.it/iri9qrz9nyhg1.jpeg,2025 spending breakdown,"30ish couple in Boston, which I feel like is MCOL after having lived in SF for five years. This was the first year I tracked our spending. Some takeaways:

\- We’re lucky. Very lucky. We both work well paid, (mostly) meaningful jobs that we (mostly) enjoy. We live in a beautiful city and have great friends and family here and across the country and world. I should stop to appreciate those things more. Our incomes aren’t crazy high by subreddit standards where everyone is a doctor making 850k, but they put us in the global 1%. We should donate far more. 

\- We spent a lot on travel and it was all worth it. This was the biggest single line item after rent. None of our trips was extravagant - economy class flights, staying with family/friends or in cheap hotels, backpacking - but we took a lot of them. Europe five times, Asia, Oceania, Mexico, several domestic visits to California, New York, and elsewhere. Many weddings and family holidays. We have so many memories—swimming in mountain lakes, dancing with friends through the night, running on pacific beaches at sunrise, and of course curling up on airport floors afterwards. We’re lucky to have flexible jobs; I want to travel even more in 2026. 

\- I could and should save thousands by taking leftovers to the office consistently. I could do the same with coffee, but I won’t. Our local cafe is great, we’re friends with the baristas and the other regulars. Money spent creating social connection is money spent well. 

\- We should probably save more for retirement, but I hate the idea of locking the money up when there’s so much I want to do in the meantime - buy a house, have kids, start a business, donate. My best friend died at 24, and my brother was diagnosed with stage four cancer at 27; both events color my thinking. 

\- I should spend more on clothes. Most of that spending was my wife and she has excellent taste. I should develop my own and ditch my college era jeans and hoodies. 

\- Living where you don’t need a car saves so much money. No monthly payment, no gas, no insurance, no maintenance. Underrated benefit of otherwise expensive cities.

\- This was a fun exercise and helped me reflect on my life. I don’t feel the need to do it again. I’ll keep my eye on the numbers loosely, but life’s too short to live in a spreadsheet. We’re fine, it’s fine.

**Location:** Sedona, Arizona

**Date**: June 24, 2026

  
**Chapter One: The Age of Aquarius Breathes**



Sedona woke before the sun. The red rocks held the cool of night like a secret, their silhouettes rising in quiet authority as cicadas stitched sound into the thinning dark. Somewhere between the last stars and the first hint of gold, Lily Wildflower Davis sat cross‑legged on the wooden floor of her casita, palms open, eyes closed, breathing through another sleepless dawn.

Thirty years old and usually unshakably upbeat, Lily was known throughout Uptown Sedona as the tarot reader who laughed easily, whose readings felt like warm tea instead of judgment. Her shop Wildflower Path sat on a side street off Jordan Road, wrapped in prayer flags and juniper smoke. Tourists came out of curiosity. Locals came for clarity. And a growing number came because the world, lately, felt thin.

It was the Age of Aquarius, astrologers said. A time of awakening. Of reckoning. What they didn’t say what Lily had learned the hard way was that awakenings attracted attention.

She hadn’t slept properly in weeks.

Every night, the same pattern: drifting toward rest only to be snapped awake by whispering shadows behind her eyes. Dreams that weren’t dreams. Figures crouched at the edge of her consciousness, pressing cold fingers into her thoughts, feeding on exhaustion and doubt. When she did sleep, she woke shaking, heart racing, sheets twisted like she’d been fighting underwater.

Dream Demons.

She didn’t use the term lightly. Lily had worked with guides, ancestors, and the occasional trickster spirit before. This was different. These entities were invasive, parasitic, drawn to light like moths with teeth. They thrived in liminal spaces sleep, trance, grief. And they were very interested in her.

She opened her eyes as the first sunlight kissed Bell Rock. Her reflection in the window startled her: dark circles, skin dulled by fatigue, wild curls pulled into a loose knot as if she’d given up mid‑gesture. “Okay,” she murmured, forcing a smile. “Message received.” Outside, the wind shifted.

Somewhere beyond sight, unseen worlds leaned closer.



**A Personal Tarot Reading**

**Location:** Wildflower Path  Lily’s office, before opening



The shop was still dark, the closed sign turned inward like a secret.

Lily Wildflower Davis sat at her small wooden desk in the back office, legs tucked beneath her, steam curling lazily from a ceramic mug painted with tiny white daisies. Daisy tea gentle, calming, something her grandmother had sworn by when the mind wouldn’t stop racing.

She took a slow sip. Bitter at first. Then soft. “Alright,” she murmured to herself. “Just you and me.”

The tarot deck rested in her hands, warm from years of use. The cards knew her touch. She shuffled slowly, deliberately, listening to the faint whisper of card stock sliding against itself. Outside, Sedona held its breath, the red rocks still shadowed, the sun not yet ready to witness whatever truth might surface.

This wasn’t a reading for a client. This was personal. She closed her eyes and centered herself, breath moving through her spine. What is happening to me? she asked silently. And why now?

She began to cut the deck.

Once.

Twice. On the third cut, the air shifted. Three cards jumped from the deck as if flicked by an unseen finger, skidding across the desk and landing face down in a neat, accusatory line.

Lily froze.

“That’s… dramatic,” she whispered.

Her pulse thudded in her ears. Cards popping out weren’t unheard of but three at once, during a private reading, before sunrise? That was a message that insisted on being heard. She set her tea aside and turned over the first card.

The Nine of Swords.

Of course. Sleeplessness. Anxiety. Nightmares. The mind devours itself in the dark. Lily exhaled through her nose, a humorless smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah,” she said quietly. “I know.”

The second card followed.

The Moon.

Illusion. Hidden enemies. The veil between worlds thinning. Dreams that lied and truths that refused to stay buried. Her fingers hesitated over the third card. The room felt colder now. Not unpleasant just alert. She flipped it. The Devil.

Horned. Smiling. Eyes sharp with mockery.

The image seemed to pulse, the chains around the figures’ necks glinting as if freshly polished. Lily stared at it longer than she meant to, a familiar pressure blooming behind her eyes the same one that visited her in the early hours of restless nights. “Well,” she said softly. “There you are.” She didn’t feel fear. Not exactly.

She felt recognition.

“This isn’t about temptation,” she said, voice steady, analytical. “This is about attachment. Parasitic influence. Something feeding.” The candle on her desk flickered, though there was no draft. For just a second only a second she could’ve sworn the Devil’s grin widened.

Lily gathered the three cards and stacked them neatly, placing a clear quartz on top. “No,” she said firmly, reclaiming the space. “You don’t get to sit with me uninvited.”

She finished her tea in one long swallow, stood, and opened the curtains, letting the first blade of morning light cut through the office. The shop will open soon. And now she knows This wasn’t random. Something had noticed her.

And it was time to escalate.

**Chapter Two: The Sleepless Spiral**



By mid morning, Wildflower Path buzzed with its usual rhythm. Crystals caught the sun, throwing rainbows across shelves. Incense burned low and sweet. Lily laid out cards for a couple from Phoenix, her voice steady, intuition still sharp but underneath it all, something scraped.

When she touched the deck, static jumped. The High Priestess reversed. Twice. That never happened. She blinked, steadying herself as the room tilted for half a heartbeat. Behind her eyes, the whispering returned mocking now, threaded with hunger.

You shine too loud. You don’t rest. You belong to us when you sleep. Lily finished the reading on muscle memory alone. Once the shop emptied, she locked the door and sagged against it, breath coming shallow.

This was escalation.

She had cleansed. Grounded. Called on her usual guardians. She’d slept with obsidian under her pillow, amethyst on her nightstand, a bowl of saltwater by the bed. Nothing slowed them.

That afternoon, she drove out toward the vortex near Cathedral Rock, hoping the land itself might help. Sedona’s energy had always felt like an old friend firm, patient, alive. She sat on warm stone, pressed her palms to the earth, and whispered, “I need backup.” The response came as pressure, not sound. The air thickened. Her thoughts sharpened. Not all help arrives uninvited.

She knew then what she’d been avoiding.

This was bigger than personal protection. Bigger than insomnia. This was warfare. That night, exhaustion finally dragged her under—and straight into the waiting dark.

She stood in a dreamscape of fractured mirrors. Figures slithered between reflections, eyes like pits, mouths unfolding too wide. Awake little oracle, they crooned. You open doors. We walk through. Lily planted her feet. “No,” she said, voice ringing louder than fear. “I revoke consent.” They laughed. And rushed her.

She woke screaming, body soaked in sweat, heart hammering like it wanted out.

Enough.



**Chapter Three: The Summoning**

**Arch Angel Alasg Araveal and the Source Above All**

**Location:** An Unknown Realm in the Heavens



There was no horizon here.

No up or down, no distance measured in stars or time. The realm existed as presence—a vast field of awareness where thought moved faster than light and intention shaped reality before form could follow.

At its center burned the Source Above All.

Not a figure. Not a face. A brilliance so complete it could not be looked at directly, yet could never be mistaken. It was warmth and gravity and silence all at once the origin from which every name for God had ever been borrowed.

Before it stood Arch Angel Alasg Araveal.

His wings were folded, not in submission, but in precision. His form shimmered with layered geometry armor made of purpose, light arranged into meaning. He did not speak aloud.

Here, the sound was unnecessary.

The Dream Demons have crossed a threshold, Alasg Araveal conveyed, his thoughts moving like clean thunder through the expanse. They exploit the thinning veil of the Age of Aquarius. They feed on exhaustion, on the unguarded dream state of humanity.

The Source responded not with words, but with understanding so vast it briefly overwhelmed even him. Images unfolded: millions of humans asleep, minds unshielded, luminous threads flickering as unseen hands tugged.

Balance has been strained, the Source expressed. Yet free will remains inviolate.

Alasg Araveal inclined his head.

One among them has become a focal point, he continued. Lily Wildflower Davis. A signal-bearer. She opens doors naturally not from ambition, but from service. The Dream Demons circle her because she anchors light without armor.

A pause.

In that pause every prayer existed ever whispered. Will you intervene? Alasg Araveal asked not as a demand, but as a question shaped by duty.

The Source brightened, not in intensity but in clarity. You already know the answer, it conveyed. She must ask. The archangel felt it then a subtle tremor moving through the realms. Not fear. Not despair.

Resolve.

Far below, in a world of red stone and incense smoke, a human heart was steadying itself. Candles were being lit. A circle drawn not from ego, but from necessity. Alasg Araveal’s wings stirred. When the call is made, the Source impressed upon him, you may answer. And then He felt it. A name, spoken aloud with reverence and trembling courage. Not shouted. Not begged.

Invoked.



**“Arch Angel Alasg Araveal.”**



The sound echoed across planes of existence like a bell struck at the center of creation. Alasg Araveal unfurled his wings, light cascading from him in disciplined arcs. She has called, he sent to the Source. The brilliance pulsed once approval, trust, release.

Go, the Source answered. And with that single permission, the archangel turned toward the descending currents of reality, already moving to restore order. to answer a human voice brave enough to ask.

She hadn’t done a full ceremonial summoning since her early twenties, back when mentors still hovered and mistakes were part of the curriculum. But this wasn’t about bravado. It was about survival and responsibility.

She swept the floor with a cedar. Marked the cardinal directions with stones from each vortex site she’d visited over the years. Lit seven candles, each one representing a layer of consciousness.

At the center, she sat barefoot, spine straight, hands over her heart.

“I call not from ego,” she said aloud, voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. “I call from service. From balance. From love.” The temperature dropped. The wind surged through closed windows, lifting her hair as if underwater.

She spoke the name she’d only ever written in her private grimoire.



**“Arch Angel Alasg Araveal.”**



The air split. Light poured into the room not blinding, but vast. Structured. Intelligent. It felt like standing before a mountain that could speak.

He appeared as layered radiance shaped loosely like wings and armor, eyes holding galaxies folded into calm authority. Around him, forms emerged his team, luminous sentinels humming with purpose. You called clearly, Araveal’s voice resonated, not in her ears but in her bones. And you were heard.

Lily bowed her head, tears slipping free. “Dream Demons. They’re attacking light workers. Feeding on exhaustion. I can’t hold them alone.” The archangel’s presence sharpened. They exploit the thinning veil. But they do not own it. The candles flared blue.

We will restore order, Araveal said. But understand this, Lily Wildflower Davis: you are not a victim in this story. You are a node. A signal. That is why they came. The room shook not violently, but decisively. Beyond the walls of the casita, unseen battlegrounds ignited.



**Chapter Four: War in the Unseen**



Sleep took Lily like a river. This time, she did not fall alone.

She entered the dreamscape armored in light, Araveal’s presence behind her like a steady sun. His team fanned out, severing shadow‑threads, sealing breaches Lily hadn’t known she carried.

The Dream Demons emerged in force, shrieking as their feeding grounds collapsed. She is ours! they howled. She is sovereign, Araveal answered.

What followed wasn’t violence as humans understood it. It was a correction. Frequencies snapping back into harmony. Parasitic forms unravel when denied resonance. Lily stood her ground, heart blazing, and for the first time in weeks, felt rested truly rested even while awake within the dream.

She raised her hands and spoke from the deepest place she knew. “You are not welcome in my field, or in the fields of those I serve. Return to your origin or dissolve.” The Dream Demons screamed not in pain, but in loss.

One by one, they collapsed into nothing. Silence followed. Then warmth. Balance is restored for now, Araveal said gently. But the Age of Aquarius is not passive. Humanity must learn to guard its dreams. Lily nodded. She understood.

This wasn’t the end. It was the beginning.



**Chapter Five: The Morning After**



Lily woke to sunlight and birdsong. No whispers. No shadows. She lay still, stunned by the simplicity of it rest without resistance. Her body felt heavy in a good way, like soil after rain.

Outside, Sedona glowed brighter than she remembered.

She brewed coffee, opened every window, and laughed out loud for no reason other than relief. By noon, people would come to Wildflower Path seeking answers, comfort, and guidance. And Lily would be ready. Before opening the shop, she placed a small sign by the door: Your dreams matter. Protect them.

Somewhere beyond sight, Arch Angel Alasg Araveal watched the timelines settle.The war continued, quietly. But Lily Wildflower Davis slept well that night and the Dream Demons did not return.

[Eureka Mignon Zero],"Hi guys, I’m asking for help with a weird grinding issue on my Eureka Mignon Zero. I've been using this grinder since 2023 without any major problems. I clean it regularly with Grindz and a brush, and once in a while, I do a deep clean.

Last week, I deep-cleaned the grinder and unscrewed the burrs to clean them, but since then, I haven’t been able to grind fine enough. Even when I am just about 1mm (rotation-wise) from the zero point (where the burrs touch), the result is like 40g in 10 seconds. I haven't changed anything on my espresso machine, so that shouldn't be the problem. I’ve even tried the marker test, and the result shows that about 95% of the marker is gone on both burrs, so alignment seems okay.

I’ve tried different coffees, like Milky Cake from DAK roastery, which worked perfectly before the last deep cleaning, I still had plenty of room to go finer before reaching the zero point. I also tried a different, slightly darker roast from another roastery, and it was also a total turbo shot.

Work has been doing a number on my mental health (corporate marketing), and I’m escaping my own personal hell for four nights at the end of February. I’m proud of how much my family and I have experienced in previous PR trips—I wrote \[this recap post\](https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/u9w8os/5\_things\_i\_learned\_during\_my\_recent\_trip\_to/) following our first trip to the island (lost access to that account)—but I’m probably looking for a different kind of trip this time around. 

I’m going to spend the first half of the trip in Condado/San Juan, and then drive down to Rio Grande for the back half. I’m looking forward to walking the forts alone one day, and maybe doing some exploring of El Yunque later in the trip. And since my kids aren’t around, I can eat at fancier restaurants, like Marmalade and Santaella, so that’s really exciting. 

Our previous trips were focused on adventure and cultural immersion. This trip, I really want to focus on reenergizing and treating myself. 

An extra bit of context to help guide recommendations: in general, I’m naturally introverted, but can force extroversion when required or depending on the environment. I’m friendly and very open to conversing with locals, but I don’t know that I’m looking for friends or travel partners (as this trip is meant to be self-serving).

All of his siblings have left the church (he’s the only one who served a mission). His best friend/mission companion is out. Now I’m out too technically PIMO since I haven’t removed my records yet.

His parents are still believing, but he isn’t particularly close with them.

What I’m struggling with is his mindset. He seems convinced that he is right for staying in, and the rest of us are wrong, offended, lazy, deceived, taking the easy way out, etc. There’s a quiet superiority there that’s hard to ignore.

At the same time, his actual life doesn’t match that certainty.

He drinks coffee occasionally. He’s covered in tattoos he got after his mission. He swears like a sailor. And yet he holds a stake youth calling and attends sacrament meeting multiple times a month and defies their demands for him to meet certain grooming and appearance standards.

It feels like he’s performing. Like he’s living two parallel lives: one inside the church, one outside of it.

I don’t know what to make of this, and honestly, I don’t know how to live with it. It feels unsustainable like he needs to either be in or out instead of straddling both worlds while judging everyone else who chose differently.

Has anyone else dealt with a spouse who’s deeply invested in being right about the church while clearly not living it? Is this cognitive dissonance? Fear? Identity collapse in slow motion?

I’m not trying to force him out. I just want honesty especially with himself.

TL;DR:

My RM spouse is the only one in his family still in the church and seems convinced he’s right while everyone else who left is wrong. At the same time, he lives a very “non-Mormon” life (coffee, tattoos, swearing) while holding a stake calling and staying active.

1qxxfh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_busy3busy2024/comments/1qxxfh7/best_advice_for_finding_our_way_after_hard_weeks/,Best Advice for Finding Our Way After Hard Weeks,"There’s a moment that comes after tough weeks.

Not when everything is suddenly better.  
Not when life feels easy again.

But when things are… quieter.

The hospital stays are over.  
The worst of the illness has passed.  
The chaos has slowed.

And yet — you still don’t feel like yourself.

If you’ve ever wondered why it takes longer to feel steady again, especially with lingering anxiety or fatigue, you’re not alone.

Finding your footing again after hard weeks doesn’t happen all at once. It’s a slow process that requires patience and hope, helping the audience feel reassured.  
It happens slowly. Gently. In ways that are easy to overlook.

# Why You Don’t “Bounce Back”

We often expect ourselves to bounce back quickly once a crisis ends.

But emotional recovery doesn’t follow the same timeline as physical recovery.

Your body might be out of danger…  
But your nervous system is still catching up.

After weeks of stress, your mind has been:

* On high alert
* Anticipating worst-case scenarios
* Carrying fear quietly
* Holding things together for others

That kind of strain doesn’t dissolve overnight.

And it shouldn’t be expected to.

# [**Finding Footing Looks Subtle — Not Dramatic**](https://pawsofability.com/articles/a-check-in-for-special-needs-families-when-caring-feels-lonely/)

We tend to look for big signs that we’re “better.”

But absolute stability returns quietly.

It looks like:

* A morning that feels a little calmer
* Laughing at something small again
* Sitting down without your heart racing
* Making plans without dread
* Feeling tired… but not panicked

These moments may feel ordinary — but after hard weeks, they’re huge.

There are signs your system is slowly settling.

# [**Routine Is Often the First Anchor**](https://familyvoices.org/)

When life feels unpredictable, routine becomes one of the safest places to land, offering the audience a sense of security and comfort during recovery.

Not rigid schedules — but familiar rhythms.

Like:

* The same morning coffee
* The same bedtime routine
* A short walk at the same time each day
* A familiar show or book
* Quiet moments that don’t demand anything from you

These simple patterns remind your body that life is becoming safe again.

And that matters more than productivity ever could.

# Routine is often the first anchor. Consider gentle self-care practices, such as mindful breathing or short walks, to support your healing.

There’s often pressure to “get back to normal.”

But the truth is — after hard weeks, *regular changes.*

You don’t go back.  
You move forward differently, gently and wisely, which can inspire confidence and reduce feelings of pressure to ‘get back to normal.’

And that’s not weakness — that’s wisdom.

Moving gently allows:

* Emotions to settle naturally
* Energy to rebuild
* Trust in stability to return
* Joy to reappear without forcing it

You are not behind because you’re moving slowly.  
You’re healing.

# You Don’t Need to Be Fully Better to Be Getting Better

Healing isn’t a moment.

It’s a direction.

You don’t need to feel strong, optimistic, or energized to be recovering.

Sometimes recovery looks like:

* Fewer tears
* Fewer racing thoughts
* More quiet moments
* Less dread when thinking about tomorrow

That is progress — even if it doesn’t feel exciting.

# A Gentle Closing Thought

If you’re in that in-between space right now —  
not in crisis anymore, but not fully steady either — let this reassure you:

You are not stuck.  
You are settling.

And that is precisely what finding your footing looks like.

Slow. Quiet. Real.

But that he still thinks that im special - he wrote me 5 lines full of compliments. And then said he hoped we could hang out, cry and laugh about the "" good old times"" and tell each other all about our ""individual paths"". 
With all this ive gathered huge effort (with chatGPTs coaching by the way) to not go into it time after time but just stick to closing answers like ""thank you"" 

3 weeks later when i found his last stuff i tried to drop them off without seeing him. And he wanted to reschedule so we could catch up.

I spent a few hours on this problem tonight. Trying to figure out why lines are on some mosaic grids but not on others.

After all the patch.lua editing, file renaming, coffee consuming and hair pulling, this is what I think I know:

The conflict appears to between `2-rounded-folder-covers` and `2--ui-font`.

* If you uncheck `2--ui-font` in patch management those lines will vanish.
* Changing the UI font to another font will fix the issue.
* Saira\_Condensed.ttf = Problem, Barlow\_Condensed.ttf = No problem
* Also changing the Screen DPI will fix this too.
* 200 DPI=problem, 190 DPI=No problem.

My guess is that some fonts don't resize enough to play nicey-nice  with the folder box they are trying to squish into.

And that nudges the folder cover borders just enough to expose a corner line.

In my picture the lines are at the bottom. But only when using 4-columns and 3-rows.

Why if I jump north or south, I dont get dragged horizontally because of the angular momentum? I its because the Earth flat, and this proofs that the Earth is flat. Checkmate.   
If you guys change your minds about this dumb theory, I can send the link of the video for you, it was made from a very smart guy, he wears a white jacket, drinks coffee and says smart things like refractional inverted density, that must proof the Earth is flat.

I am looking for some quality tasting coffee brewed with beans and not out of a K-cup.  I like it black, espresso, or americano.  I know the C9 has a light roast option which intrigues me as I like it a little less hot and quicker to drink.  Since the C9 is newer there are not a lot of reviews or comparisons between these models. I realize the C9 doesnt have a hot water option and I am fine with that.  Are there any other differences I should consider outside shape, etc. I think I would lean towards the C9 for more options for the brew but if the E6 is a superior functioning machine then that would be fine too. Thank you. They are both in my price range so cost not an issue. These are the only two I am considering.",1,1770419812.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

I recently purchased the Oberon 7s and 1s to replace my aging Fluance XL7 series towers and rears. But I need to make the call on the center channel between the Vokal and the Opticon MK2

I've got a 100"" projector screen with pretty low basement ceilings with some duct cutouts, so the space for the center channel is somewhat limited. It has to fit inside the Ikea Besta (hence why the extremely wide Grand Vokal is not an option).

Both the Vokal and MK2 are front ported, which will definitely be a major upgrade from my previous system. I was originally locked in on the Vokal, to match the Oberons, but given my slightly cramped layout, I am wondering if the MK2 might be just what the doctor ordered since, the center channel *\_has\_* to be at or slightly below the level of the coffee table there.

Am I overthinking it? Or should I upgrade the center channel a bit?

Thanks!

And yes I know the couch is too big for the space. It isn't a battle I am going to win anytime soon :)

For the last couple of weeks there has been a young boy getting PT at around 8am, during his sessions his father stands at the side drinking coffee watching the session.  

Week one, they were both in the “just for adults” area of the changing room. Thought it was odd that the father had decided that was the section to go.

Week two, the child is in the same area without the parent. The child then goes off towards the shower area. Father appears with a fresh coffee in his hand from the cafe, looks around then wanders off back out of the changing rooms. Child then comes back toward the lockers as I’m leaving. I pass the father in the lobby as I leave the club. 

This feels really poor parenting and not what the club should be allowing. At this time on a week day surely they should be utilising the family facilities and the father should not be abandoning the child in the changing rooms, let alone in the adults only section of it.

The child in question looks like they are probably about 8 at best, which also seems to go against the policies of DL.

I’ve emailed the club passing on my concerns, am I over reacting on this or is this a safeguarding issue waiting to happen?",0,1770419647.0,davidlloyd,0,0.5,False

i don’t think any of them are taking the job seriously. i get it, it’s glorified fast food, and i hate feeling like \*that\* coworker but this is my main source of income. i HAVE to care about this job no matter how much i hate it. i’ve been with the company almost 6 years and i’ve been at my store for 5.5 of those, and so by default, my SM and ASM have dubbed me the fucking babysitter for grown adults who are twice my age and can’t use their brains to figure out how to wipe up a cold brew spill or what to do if we need to refill the cup caddy. i’m so so so sick and tired of holding their hand. and i have stopped but it doesn’t stop them from following me asking for help every 0.3 seconds. my SM has been pushing to make me into an actual trainer because of all this and i refuse. i’m so fed up i might actually explode on them if i get asked by a 6 month old barista how to make a plain, basic standard iced coffee 

should i feel flattered? maybe but i really just feel like we need to retrain everyone because a store of 20+ employees (SSVs somehow included) should not be relying on one seasoned barista.

(also? these baristas were trained at another store bc we were hella understaffed when they were hired, and this is supposedly “the best store in the state”. if this is how your trainees are turning out, i don’t understand how you have such a good rep. unless they half assed it since they weren’t for her store)",22,1770419635.0,starbucksbaristas,3,0.92,False
