I'd say maybe the pies are actually cheaper at a servo than they are at a bakery these days. But obviously they are two different products, pre packaged vs fresh baked. I don't know what price the same Four n Twenty pie would be somewhere like a sports canteen or something, I am assuming cheaper.

So what is the reason they can just charge so much for a product that is widely available? Is it just a matter of them saying ""Hey you are are already here"" or ""well, try finding it somewhere else at 1am"" and basically ""fuck you, take it or leave it""?

1ojeydv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DentistPreston/comments/1ojeydv/xo_dental_shows_how_advanced_dentistry_improves/,XO Dental shows how advanced dentistry improves treatment results,"[XO Dental](https://www.xodental.co.uk/) does not sell promises. They show how specific tools, workflows, and transparency change outcomes for patients and clinicians. If you want to understand what ""advanced dentistry"" actually looks like in practice and why it matters, here are the concrete mechanics, the common pitfalls, and the measurable differences that follow when clinics adopt the right technology and processes.

https://preview.redd.it/u3hpqo14x3yf1.jpg?width=1213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b335bee0b05ccedd5b330e40d736fd260d6a136f

# What advanced dentistry means in practice

Advanced dentistry is not a single gadget. It is a combination of equipment, diagnostics, treatment planning, clinician ergonomics, and transparent patient communication. At XO Dental that combination includes modular operator units designed for better visibility and posture, modern imaging like CT scans, implant systems from established manufacturers, and a practice culture that values clear fees and informed consent.

Examples you can use to reason from. A consultation or exam at XO Dental is listed at about ¬£30. A CT scan used to plan an implant can be around ¬£100. A Straumann implant plus crown is shown at roughly ¬£2,000, with adjuncts such as bone grafting priced separately, for example around ¬£500. Aligners packages like Invisalign are shown in the region of ¬£2,900 and composite veneers from about ¬£350 per tooth. These are specific price points that illustrate how diagnostics and different treatment components stack up in real budgets.

# Why this matters for results

Good outcomes depend on diagnostics, precision, and execution.

1. Diagnostics first. Imaging and accurate scans give you the map. A CT scan reveals bone volume, nerve position, and sinus anatomy. That information changes treatment decisions. If you place an implant without 3D imaging you risk misplacement, nerve injury, or insufficient primary stability. When clinics use a CT scan for planning the implant, they reduce those risks and can plan bone grafts or staged procedures when needed.
2. Precision tools reduce variability. Digital impressions and high-quality operator units improve access and visibility. When a dentist can see every surface without awkward posture they make fewer errors in preparation and bonding. Clinics that invest in ergonomic, modular equipment report better clinician comfort and fewer operative errors over long sessions. Equipment that claims a 20-year service life is not just marketing; long-lasting, reliable instruments reduce equipment downtime and unpredictable variability in treatment.
3. Systematic planning improves predictability. Using branded implant systems from reputable manufacturers, standardised surgical protocols, and lab workflows means the variables are known. A Straumann implant, for example, has a long track record and consistent component interfaces. When clinicians choose established systems and follow evidence-based protocols outcomes become more reproducible.

# How XO‚Äôs approach changes patient experience and outcomes

Transparency about fees and steps reduces anxiety and improves adherence. XO Dental states ""no hidden charges"" and invites patients to ""call in for coffee and a chat."" That kind of upfront conversation matters. Patients who understand the staging, costs, and timelines for implants or aligner treatment are less likely to cancel, less likely to skip follow-up reviews, and more likely to follow at-home care instructions. That adherence directly influences implant integration, the longevity of restorations, and the success of periodontal therapy.

Operational improvements also matter. Modular units that give clinicians direct, unobstructed vision of tooth surfaces and let them work in ergonomic postures mean procedures are completed with less operator fatigue and better consistency. This is not theoretical. When clinicians are less fatigued their hand stability improves, they check margins more carefully, and they can maintain focus during longer restorative or surgical cases.

# When to do it: timing and staging

Start with the right diagnostic step. For surgical cases like implants, get the 3D imaging before surgical planning. For orthodontic or aligner cases, start with a comprehensive clinical exam and digital scans so the clinician can assess occlusion, periodontal health, and restorative needs in the same workflow.

Do not skip hygiene and periodontal stabilization. Many treatment failures trace back to active gum disease. If pockets or bleeding on probing are present, treat and stabilise the periodontium first. That reduces the risk of implant failure and improves outcomes for crowns and veneers.

Use staged planning for complex cases. An implant case may require a CT scan, virtual planning, a surgical guide, grafting, and staged loading. Each stage has its own decision points. Treat them as a roadmap, not a one-off appointment.

# How it‚Äôs done: specific steps that improve outcomes

1. Comprehensive assessment and transparent quote. Start with exam, periodontal charting, digital photos, and if indicated, a CT scan. Present the patient with itemised options. Show the cost of the implant, the crown, a CT scan, and graft materials separately so the patient knows what each stage does.
2. Digital planning. Use intraoral scanning and 3D planning software. For implants, plan the prosthetic outcome first and place the implant to suit the restoration. This prosthetically driven approach prevents poorly angled implants that complicate crown design.
3. Surgical accuracy. Use surgical guides when bone anatomy or esthetics demand high precision. A guide that aligns with a virtual plan can reduce deviation in position and depth.
4. Control the environment. Use high-quality suction, isolation like rubber dam for restorations when bonding is critical, and ergonomic seating and delivery systems to maintain clinician precision.
5. Follow-up and maintenance. Schedule reviews for hygiene, occlusal checks, and prosthetic adjustments. For implants, review osseointegration and check for peri-implant inflammation. Preventive maintenance extends the life of the restoration.

# Common mistakes that undermine advanced technology

1. Skipping the basics. Fancy imaging cannot fix active periodontal disease. If you place implants into an inflamed environment you raise failure risk.
2. Treating imaging as decoration. A CT scan without proper interpretation is worthless. The data must inform surgical depth, angulation, and implant diameter.
3. Using cheap components for critical interfaces. Cutting costs by substituting components on implant systems, or choosing unknown materials for bonding, increases long-term complications.
4. Rushing planning to save chair time. Planning is the safeguard. Trying to save time in the planning phase often doubles time later in revisions or complications.
5. Poor communication about staged costs. If patients are surprised by separate fees for CT scans, grafts, or lab work they lose trust and may abandon treatment. Transparency avoids that.

# What happens if you do this wrong

If you skimp on diagnostics you increase the chance of nerve injury, sinus complications, implant failure, or poorly fitting prosthetics. If you ignore periodontal health you risk peri-implantitis and restoration failure. If you use substandard materials or inconsistent workflows you get more repairs and earlier replacements. Those are not hypothetical risks. They translate to additional procedures, additional cost, and worse patient satisfaction.

# Real, practical metrics to watch

Track these to verify that advanced dentistry is actually improving outcomes in your clinic.

* Treatment acceptance rate after a transparent consult. If patients accept staged plans more often when you use clear itemised proposals that is an immediate metric of improved communication.
* Complication rate for implants within the first year. Lower early complications after adopting CT scans and guided surgery indicate better surgical planning.
* Return visits for restoration adjustments. Fewer post-delivery adjustments mean your lab and digital planning are aligned with clinical execution.
* Clinician-reported fatigue and ergonomic complaints. If upgrading operator units reduces musculoskeletal complaints, clinicians work better over time.

# Final practical note

Implementing advanced dentistry is not an aesthetic choice. It is a systems choice. Invest in diagnostics and proven components. Standardise protocols. Make pricing and stages transparent. Train staff to follow the workflow. The result is not just prettier scans or a clinic that looks modern. The result is fewer surprises, better surgical predictability, longer lasting restorations, and more satisfied patients.

XO Dental‚Äôs materials and pricing on their pages show the elements of this approach in plain terms. Use specific diagnostics like CT scanning when indicated. Use established implant systems for predictable interfaces. Use ergonomically designed equipment to reduce operator variability. Communicate cost and stages to patients up front. Do that and the treatment results change in ways you can measure.",1,1761768112.0,DentistPreston,0,1.0,False

And it got easier. As if the heaviness lifted, and everything around stopped pressing down on me.

I suddenly saw that all of us in the office are like kids. Just in big bodies with serious faces. And if you imagine it‚Äôs a kindergarten, then the weird behavior, the silent treatment, and the little dramas somehow become easier to deal with.

I decided to write down this sketch ‚Äî mostly for myself, but maybe it‚Äôll resonate with someone else too. Because when you live with CPTSD, just surviving an office environment is already an achievement. And if you can also find something funny in it ‚Äî that‚Äôs a real win.

Here‚Äôs my little story:

‚∏ª

Our kindergarten

Every morning, I arrive at our ‚Äúkindergarten.‚Äù
I enter through the back door, where the ‚Äúnaughty kids‚Äù hang out ‚Äî the ones who sneak off to puff smoke and pretend they‚Äôre grown-ups. There‚Äôs a tiny room there with two boys inside, and for some reason, there are often empty wine bottles on their windowsill. Under the window is an overflowing ashtray bin. It smells like an old pub, but this path has somehow become familiar and even comforting to me.

Then comes a long, long corridor ‚Äî like in a sanatorium or an old hotel. Rooms on both sides. On one end is the main entrance ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the ‚Äúteachers‚Äù (management) come in. They park their little scooters there. There‚Äôs a secretary sitting near the door ‚Äî like the ‚Äúhall monitor‚Äù ‚Äî with a cabinet behind her full of coffee cookies. For some reason, nobody eats those cookies but me. I take some for myself and for the other ‚Äúkids‚Äù in my group.

Then there‚Äôs a room where a girl works ‚Äî she makes the same kind of ‚Äúcrafts‚Äù I do (we have the same job). She‚Äôs older, and honestly, it feels like she doesn‚Äôt like me much. When I say ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù she pretends to go deaf. But I don‚Äôt give up.
Today, for example, she brought in heart-shaped cookies for her birthday. At first, I wanted to proudly refuse them, but then I thought ‚Äî they‚Äôre good cookies. I ate one and wrote her a birthday message. Because just because someone acts like a little poop doesn‚Äôt mean I have to do the same.

There are lots of other rooms: some are for group play (aka meetings), others are for the ‚Äúteachers.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a big room full of drawing kids ‚Äî it‚Äôs where the designers sit, about twenty of them. Across the hall are four ‚Äúbuyers.‚Äù I like one of the girls there ‚Äî she has a son I know; we used to go to judo together. And two of the boys ‚Äî I think they might have a little crush on me. They always look happy when I show up, and if I come in to ‚Äúplay,‚Äù they‚Äôre always excited to join me.

And then there‚Äôs this one ‚Äúbig drawing kid‚Äù who sits alone in a big room and doesn‚Äôt really want to share it. You could easily fit five more people in there, but he likes to play alone.

I sit in my little group: one boy and one girl. The girl is kind of mean. At first, I didn‚Äôt know how to play with her, but now I get it: it‚Äôs better not to. Whatever happens, I‚Äôll end up being the one to blame anyway.

The cafeteria is often noisy ‚Äî especially when the kids start talking about politics or tummy aches during lunch. That‚Äôs usually when I sneak off to eat somewhere quiet.

And I‚Äôve become friends with one of the ‚Äúmain teachers,‚Äù who sits right across from the bathroom. Funny spot for an office, but we get along great.

So that‚Äôs our kindergarten. Loud, cheerful, a little weird at times ‚Äî but full of life. And every day, I learn new ways to play by my own rules.

\### \*\*1. HEALTH & BIOLOGY\*\*  
\*   1.1. Metformin reduces all-cause mortality and diseases of ageing in some populations.  
\*   1.2. Anticholinergic drugs (including some antihistamines and some antidepressants) are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and all-cause mortality.  
\*   1.3. Magnesium has anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) properties and may serve as a simple way to help regulate mood and stress responses.  
\*   1.4. It may be possible to improve fluid intelligence scores by doing Dual-N-Back training.  
\*   1.5. Smoking can have immediate disastrous effects on health; for those with a predisposition, it can trigger the onset of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  
\*   1.6. Use of high-potency marijuana is correlated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia in predisposed individuals.  
\*   1.7. Owning cats may lead to exposure to \*Toxoplasma gondii\*. Infection has been correlated with changes in personality and behavior, such as increased impulsivity.  
\*   1.8. Building cognitive reserve reduces the risk of developing dementia. Cognitive reserve is built by education, having an engaging job, participating in complex hobbies, and social engagement.  
\*   1.9. Unless an individual is morbidly obese or has comorbidities like hypertension, losing weight might not improve all-cause mortality statistics, particularly for those in the 'overweight' (BMI > 25) or 'Class I obesity' (30 < BMI < 35) categories. This is known as the 'obesity paradox'.  
\*   1.10. Many former smokers credit Allen Carr's ""Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" with changing the psychological framework of addiction, making it easier to quit.

\### \*\*2. PSYCHOLOGY & MENTAL MODELS\*\*  
\*   2.1. \*\*Hanlon's Razor:\*\* The principle suggests ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence or carelessness."" Applying this can reduce anger and interpersonal conflict.  
\*   2.2. \*\*The Dunning-Kruger Effect:\*\* A cognitive bias where people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. Being aware of this can foster intellectual humility and a desire to learn more before forming strong opinions.  
\*   2.3. \*\*The Peak-End Rule:\*\* People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (its most intense point) and at its end, rather than on the total sum or average of every moment. One can engineer better memories by intentionally planning a strong positive peak and a pleasant ending.  
\*   2.4. \*\*The 5-to-1 Ratio:\*\* Research by Dr. John Gottman indicates that successful long-term relationships tend to maintain a ratio of at least five positive interactions for every one negative interaction during conflict.  
\*   2.5. \*\*The Spotlight Effect:\*\* Individuals tend to overestimate how much others notice their appearance or actions. Realizing this can reduce social anxiety and self-consciousness.  
\*   2.6. \*\*Choice Overload:\*\* Being presented with too many options can lead to decision-making paralysis and lower satisfaction with the choice ultimately made. Intentionally limiting one's options can increase satisfaction.  
\*   2.7. \*\*The Zeigarnik Effect:\*\* People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. To overcome procrastination, starting a task for just five minutes can make it stick in your mind, increasing the likelihood of completion.  
\*   2.8. \*\*Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset:\*\* Research by Carol Dweck shows that individuals who believe their abilities can be developed (growth mindset) tend to achieve more and show greater resilience than those who believe their abilities are static (fixed mindset).  
\*   2.9. \*\*The Benjamin Franklin Effect:\*\* A person who has already performed a favor for another person is more likely to do another favor for that person than if they had \*received\* a favor from them. Asking for a small, reasonable favor can be a way to build rapport.  
\*   2.10. \*\*Confirmation Bias:\*\* The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms or supports one's preexisting beliefs. Actively seeking disconfirming evidence can lead to more accurate beliefs and better decisions.

\### \*\*3. PRODUCTIVITY & LEARNING\*\*  
\*   3.1. \*\*Spaced Repetition:\*\* We retain information more effectively when we review it at increasing intervals over time. Software like Anki or AnkiDroid automates this process for efficient memorization.  
\*   3.2. \*\*The Feynman Technique:\*\* A method for learning a concept by explaining it in simple terms, as if teaching it to someone who doesn't understand it. This process quickly reveals gaps in your own understanding.  
\*   3.3. \*\*Parkinson's Law:\*\* ""Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."" Setting artificially short (but reasonable) deadlines for tasks can increase focus and efficiency.  
\*   3.4. \*\*Interleaving:\*\* Mixing different subjects or skills in a single study session is more effective for long-term retention and problem-solving than studying one topic for a long block of time (""blocking"").  
\*   3.5. \*\*The Pomodoro Technique:\*\* A time management method that uses a timer to break work into focused 25-minute intervals, separated by short breaks. It is designed to improve focus and prevent mental fatigue.  
\*   3.6. \*\*The Two-Minute Rule:\*\* If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, doing it immediately prevents it from piling up and draining mental energy later.  
\*   3.7. \*\*Deep Work:\*\* The ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. Cal Newport's research suggests that scheduling specific, protected blocks of time for 'deep work' can dramatically increase the quality and quantity of output.  
\*   3.8. \*\*Sleep and Memory Consolidation:\*\* The brain processes and consolidates memories during sleep, particularly REM and slow-wave sleep. A full night's sleep after a study session is a crucial part of the learning process itself.  
\*   3.9. \*\*Context-Dependent Memory:\*\* We recall information more easily when we are in the same context (environment, mood) in which we learned it. Varying study locations can create more retrieval cues, making knowledge more robust and accessible in different situations.  
\*   3.10. \*\*Active Recall:\*\* The act of actively retrieving information from memory (e.g., through self-testing) is a much more effective study method than passively reviewing material (e.g., re-reading notes or textbooks).

\### \*\*4. PERSONAL FINANCE\*\*  
\*   4.1. \*\*Compound Interest:\*\* The addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit. Starting to invest early, even small amounts, can lead to significant wealth over time due to the exponential nature of compounding.  
\*   4.2. \*\*Index Funds:\*\* Over long periods, low-cost, passively managed index funds have historically outperformed the majority of actively managed mutual funds, primarily due to lower fees and broader diversification.  
\*   4.3. \*\*The 4% Rule:\*\* A guideline for retirement suggesting that if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio's initial value each year, adjusted for inflation, your funds have a high probability of lasting for at least 30 years.  
\*   4.4. \*\*""Pay Yourself First"":\*\* The principle of treating savings and investments as a mandatory first ""bill."" Automating transfers to a separate account on payday ensures saving happens before discretionary spending can derail it.  
\*   4.5. \*\*Emergency Fund:\*\* A fund containing 3-6 months of essential living expenses, kept in a liquid and easily accessible savings account, prevents the need to go into debt or sell investments during unexpected events.  
\*   4.6. \*\*High-Interest Debt:\*\* The interest on credit card debt and payday loans is often so high that it is mathematically one of the highest-return ""investments"" a person can make to pay it off as quickly as possible.  
\*   4.7. \*\*Lifestyle Inflation:\*\* The tendency to increase spending as income rises. Consciously directing a large portion of any salary increase towards savings and investments accelerates financial independence.  
\*   4.8. \*\*Tax-Advantaged Accounts:\*\* Retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA offer significant tax benefits (either tax-deferred or tax-free growth) that are not available in standard brokerage accounts.  
\*   4.9. \*\*Credit Score Impact:\*\* A higher credit score gives access to lower interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, and other credit, which can save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime.  
\*   4.10. \*\*The Latte Factor:\*\* Small, regular expenses (like a daily coffee) can add up to surprisingly large sums over time. Tracking these expenses can reveal significant opportunities for savings.

\### \*\*5. RELATIONSHIPS & SOCIAL DYNAMICS\*\*  
\*   5.1. \*\*Active Listening:\*\* The practice of paraphrasing what someone has just said (""So, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're feeling..."") before responding. It confirms understanding and makes the speaker feel heard.  
\*   5.2. \*\*Non-Violent Communication (NVC):\*\* A communication framework that involves four steps: expressing observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It de-escalates conflict by avoiding blame and focusing on universal human needs.  
\*   5.3. \*\*'Bids for Connection':\*\* Small verbal or non-verbal gestures that invite a response and connection (e.g., a sigh, a comment on the weather, a touch on the arm). The act of ""turning towards"" these bids is a fundamental building block of emotional connection.  
\*   5.4. \*\*Vulnerability Fosters Trust:\*\* Research by Bren√© Brown shows that appropriate, reciprocal vulnerability is not a weakness but a prerequisite for building trust, intimacy, and a sense of belonging.  
\*   5.5. \*\*The Pygmalion Effect:\*\* Higher expectations placed upon people lead to an increase in their performance, and lower expectations lead to a decrease. The expectations you hold for others can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  
\*   5.6. \*\*Dunbar's Number:\*\* A suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships, proposed to be around 150. This implies that social energy is a finite resource best invested in a core group.  
\*   5.7. \*\*Reciprocity:\*\* The social norm of responding to a positive action with another positive action. Providing genuine, unexpected value to others is a powerful way to build strong professional and personal networks.  
\*   5.8. \*\*The 'Gray Rock Method':\*\* A technique for dealing with manipulative or dramatic individuals by becoming as uninteresting and unresponsive as a gray rock. This deprives them of the emotional reaction they seek.  
\*   5.9. \*\*Sharing Experiences Over Possessions:\*\* Studies show that spending money on experiences (like travel or concerts) provides more lasting happiness and fosters stronger social connections than spending money on material possessions.  
\*   5.10. \*\*The Power of Open-Ended Questions:\*\* Questions that cannot be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" (e.g., ""What was the most interesting part of your day?"") encourage deeper conversation and connection than closed-ended questions.

\### \*\*6. CULTURE & AESTHETICS\*\*  
\*   6.1. Classical music is actually very good and worth listening. It makes no sense to miss the chance to enjoy it. YouTube is full of high quality, instantly accessible classical music.  
\*   6.2. The website [digitaldreamdoor.com](http://digitaldreamdoor.com) has high quality lists of greatest songs, albums, pieces of music, movies, books and video games, subdivided in categories. Very worth of exploring.  
\*   6.3. International music is worthy of exploration. There are many excellent songs you have never heard, just because they are in a different language. If they were in English, many of them would be international hits.  
\*   6.4. The best way to become a reader and develop a reading habit is to make a rule to always be reading at least one book. As soon as you finish one, start the next. Be a ""chain reader.""  
\*   6.5. \*\*The Hero's Journey:\*\* This narrative pattern, identified by Joseph Campbell, is found in countless myths, stories, and films worldwide. Understanding its structure (departure, initiation, return) can deepen one's appreciation of storytelling.  
\*   6.6. \*\*Museum Free Days:\*\* Many world-class museums offer specific days or evenings with free or ""pay-what-you-wish"" admission. A simple web search for ""free museum days \[your city\]"" can unlock access to major cultural institutions.  
\*   6.7. \*\*Public Domain:\*\* Works whose intellectual property rights have expired (e.g., most books published before 1928 in the US) are free for anyone to use, read, and adapt. Websites like Project Gutenberg host thousands of these classics.  
\*   6.8. \*\*The 'Third Place':\*\* A term for public places separate from the two usual social environments of home ('first place') and work ('second place'). Actively frequenting a third place (like a coffee shop, library, or park) can improve social well-being and community connection.  
\*   6.9. \*\*Documentary Films:\*\* They provide in-depth explorations of subjects often overlooked by mainstream media. Curated lists of top-rated documentaries on sites like IMDb can be a shortcut to expanding one's knowledge on a topic.  
\*   6.10. \*\*Architectural Tourism:\*\* One can gain a new appreciation for their own city or a travel destination by researching and visiting its significant architectural sites. It changes how you perceive and interact with the built environment.

\### \*\*7. PHILANTHROPY & GLOBAL ISSUES\*\*  
\*   7.1. You can save a life by donating around $4,000-$5,000 to charities like the Against Malaria Foundation or Malaria Consortium, according to analysis by charity evaluator GiveWell.  
\*   7.2. You can prevent a case of blindness by donating around $100 to charities that perform trachoma surgeries.  
\*   7.3. There is a social movement concerned with finding the most effective ways of doing good; it's called Effective Altruism. Many of their top-recommended charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than an average charity.  
\*   7.4. Economic inequality is not only a matter of fairness; high levels of inequality have been shown to correlate with slower economic growth and increased social instability.  
\*   7.5. \*\*QALYs:\*\* The ""Quality-Adjusted Life Year"" is a metric used in public health to measure the effectiveness of interventions, combining years of life added with the quality of that life. Understanding this concept helps evaluate which health charities do the most good per dollar.  
\*   7.6. \*\*Microlending:\*\* Platforms like Kiva allow individuals to lend small amounts of money to entrepreneurs in developing countries, with historically high repayment rates. The money is then re-lent, recycling the impact of the initial loan.  
\*   7.7. \*\*The 'Overhead Myth':\*\* Judging a charity by its administrative costs is not an effective way to measure its impact. A charity with 20% overhead that is highly effective is a better choice than a charity with 5% overhead that achieves little.  
\*   7.8. \*\*Existential Risk Mitigation:\*\* Some of the greatest potential threats to humanity's long-term future (e.g., uncontrolled AI, engineered pandemics) have a low probability but catastrophic consequences. Supporting organizations that work on mitigating these risks can have a vast long-term impact.  
\*   7.9. \*\*Blood Donation:\*\* A single blood donation can help save up to three lives, and there are chronic shortages of blood in most healthcare systems. It is a free, relatively quick way to have a direct life-saving impact.  
\*   7.10. \*\*Factory Farming:\*\* The vast majority of meat, eggs, and dairy in developed nations comes from factory farms. Reducing consumption of these products is a direct way to decrease demand for a system with significant animal welfare and environmental concerns.

\### \*\*8. PRACTICAL LIFE & TECHNOLOGY\*\*  
\*   8.1. By far, the most comfortable way of using a laptop at home is to use it like a desktop computer, attached to a large external monitor and a separate, full-sized wireless keyboard and mouse.  
\*   8.2. Classical hi-fi stereos are very worth having. You can attach your computer to a stereo with a simple audio cable, providing a dramatic improvement in sound quality over computer speakers.  
\*   8.3. \*\*Password Managers:\*\* They create, store, and auto-fill unique, strong passwords for every website. Using one is a single action that resolves a major, systemic security weakness and nearly eliminates the risk of credential-stuffing attacks.  
\*   8.4. \*\*The 3-2-1 Backup Rule:\*\* A robust data protection strategy states you should have at least \*\*3\*\* copies of your data, on \*\*2\*\* different types of media, with \*\*1\*\* of those copies being off-site (e.g., in the cloud or at a different physical location).  
\*   8.5. \*\*Keyboard Shortcuts:\*\* Learning a few key shortcuts for your most-used applications (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd + F for Find, Ctrl/Cmd + K for hyperlink, Ctrl/Cmd + Tab to switch tabs) can save seconds per action, adding up to hours of saved time per year.  
\*   8.6. \*\*Right to Repair:\*\* Many manufacturers make it difficult for consumers or independent shops to repair electronic devices. Supporting companies and legislation that favor the 'right to repair' can save money, reduce electronic waste, and empower consumers.  
\*   8.7. \*\*Modern Libraries:\*\* Beyond books, public libraries often provide free access to ebooks, audiobooks (via apps like Libby), internet, museum passes, online courses, 3D printers, and community programs. A library card is a key to a vast pool of free resources.  
\*   8.8. \*\*'Mise en Place':\*\* A French culinary term meaning ""everything in its place."" By preparing and organizing all your ingredients (chopping vegetables, measuring spices) \*before\* you start cooking, the actual cooking process becomes faster, more efficient, and less stressful.  
\*   8.9. \*\*Universal Power Adapters:\*\* A single GaN (Gallium Nitride) USB-C charger can often replace multiple bulky power bricks for your laptop, phone, and tablet, simplifying travel and reducing clutter.  
\*   8.10. \*\*Use Your Phone's 'Do Not Disturb' Focus Modes:\*\* Modern smartphones allow you to create custom 'Do Not Disturb' profiles (e.g., ""Work,"" ""Reading,"" ""Driving"") that block specific apps and notifications, allowing you to control your attention.

\### \*\*9. ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY\*\*  
\*   9.1. \*\*Food Waste:\*\* Roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption is wasted globally. Meal planning, using leftovers, and proper food storage can significantly reduce personal food waste and its associated methane emissions from landfills.  
\*   9.2. \*\*'Vampire Power':\*\* Electronics plugged in on standby mode continue to draw power. Using a power strip with a switch to turn off multiple devices at once can meaningfully reduce electricity consumption.  
\*   9.3. \*\*Meat's Environmental Impact:\*\* The production of red meat, particularly beef and lamb, has a disproportionately high environmental impact (land use, water consumption, GHG emissions) compared to other protein sources like poultry, legumes, or tofu.  
\*   9.4. \*\*Fast Fashion:\*\* The business model of producing inexpensive, trendy clothing is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, water pollution, and landfill waste. Buying fewer, higher-quality items, shopping second-hand, and repairing clothing reduces this impact.  
\*   9.5. \*\*'Virtual Water':\*\* Many everyday products, especially food items, require vast amounts of water to produce (e.g., one almond requires \~1 gallon). Being mindful of the 'virtual water' in products can guide more sustainable consumption choices.  
\*   9.6. \*\*LED Lighting:\*\* LED bulbs use up to 85% less energy and last up to 25 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Replacing old bulbs is a simple, one-time action with long-term energy and cost savings.  
\*   9.7. \*\*Single-Use Plastics:\*\* The vast majority of plastic waste is not recycled and ends up in landfills or the environment. Using a reusable water bottle, coffee cup, and shopping bags are simple and highly effective ways to reduce personal plastic waste.  
\*   9.8. \*\*Local and Seasonal Food:\*\* Eating food that is grown locally and in season reduces the significant carbon emissions associated with long-distance transportation, refrigeration, and artificial ripening processes.  
\*   9.9. \*\*Rewilding:\*\* Allowing natural processes to restore ecosystems, even on a small scale. Planting native wildflowers in a garden or yard instead of a monoculture lawn can support local pollinators and increase biodiversity.  
\*   9.10. \*\*Carbon Offsetting:\*\* Services exist that allow individuals and companies to calculate the carbon footprint of unavoidable activities (like air travel) and then donate to projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of CO2 from the atmosphere.

\### \*\*10. SAFETY & SECURITY\*\*  
\*   10.1. \*\*Situational Awareness:\*\* The practice of consciously observing your surroundings‚Äîincluding people, exits, and potential threats‚Äîis a mental skill that can be practiced to avoid or de-escalate dangerous situations before they occur.

1ojepmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1ojepmk/newly_widowed_mother_is_treating_me_her_son_like/,Newly Widowed Mother is Treating me (her son) like her Partner?,"My dad passed away suddenly and tragically in a car accident 2 years ago - after he died, my mom found out he'd been having an affair. As you can imagine, it has been an incredibly difficult few years for our family. I was very close and had a great relationship with my dad and have tried my very best to move past the affair and remember him for all the great memories I have with him. Every day is a struggle but it's slowly getting easier. On the other hand, I think the affair has made it easier for my mom in a way because of how angry she is at him. She has a hard time removing herself from the anger and recognizing that I have also been deeply affected by everything - she'll often vent to me about the other woman, how much of an a\*\* hole my dad was to her, etc. I do feel sorry for her and want to be there to support her but I also find these conversations to be extremely upsetting as I am also processing my own grief and emotions. 

I've expressed that it upsets me to her multiple times, and she'll say something immature like ""fine, I won't bring it up ever again"".  Now her way around it is saying ""I know you're not going to want to hear this... but..."" and then she'll just tell me anyways. Then when I react or tell her it bothers me, she gets defensive and hangs up the phone on me. Later, when we do talk about it, I'll express that her bringing up these negative things about my dad are hard for me to hear and set the tone for the rest of my day (we often talk over a coffee first thing in the AM before work) she turns it around to herself and be like ""Well how do you think I feel, I lost my husband, look what's happened to MY life, You have your whole life ahead of you, WE were supposed to retire together"". It's always me, me, me. She's told me multiple times how it's much harder to lose a husband than a dad and will argue to get her point across of how this has been way harder on her than me - it feels like she is belittling my feelings. Never once has she asked me how I'm doing through everything.

She also feels the need to call me and tell me about every little detail that happens in her life -from her conversations with the neighbors, to her friend drama, to financial advice, to what she bought at the grocery store that day. We speak on the phone at least once a day (often times 3-4 times) and it gets exhausating. 

I feel like I've let this go on far too long, I feel sorry for her that she's on her own and know that she's lonely and heartbroken. We are constantly butting heads and it's really starting to get to me and I know I need to set some boundaries and I could really use some advice.

1ojen4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ojen4x/the_hidden_cost_of_small_habits_and_the_tool_that/,The Hidden Cost of Small Habits‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the Tool That Opened My Eyes,"I used to believe that only big expenses mattered ‚Äî rent, groceries, or car payments.
But one day, I decided to track every tiny thing I spent money on for a week.

Coffee: $2.

A quick snack: $3.

A random app subscription I forgot about: $6.
By the end of the week, those ‚Äúsmall‚Äù numbers had quietly added up to over $120.

That‚Äôs more than $1,400 a year ‚Äî gone without even noticing.

üëÄ The Problem With ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Just a Few Dollars‚Äù
The truth is, our brains don‚Äôt feel small expenses the same way we feel big ones.

We justify them because they seem harmless.
But over time, these small leaks can sink even the best budget.

That realization hit me hard. So I decided to build something simple to visualize it.

üí° The Tool That Changed How I See Spending
I created a small calculator called howmuchisave.com .

It‚Äôs a free tool that helps you quickly see how much those small daily costs add up to in a month or a year.

You just type:
What you usually spend ($)
How often you spend it (daily, weekly, etc.)
And it instantly shows you how much that habit really costs over time.

Most people are shocked by the result ‚Äî I was too.

‚öôÔ∏è Why It Works
The moment you see the numbers, your mindset changes.

You realize that:
$5 a day = $150 a month
$50 a week = $2,600 a year
And those ‚Äútiny treats‚Äù can easily become a vacation, new laptop, or debt-free month.

Awareness is the first step to better decisions.

üß≠ The Takeaway
You don‚Äôt need to stop enjoying life.

You just need to see where your money actually goes.

That‚Äôs why I built howmuchisave.com ‚Äî not to make you feel guilty, but to help you stay conscious of your choices.

Because small habits can either drain your wallet ‚Äî or build your wealth.",1,1761767388.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Whale of a player here (likely one of the biggest on this game), so I know people‚Äôs answers to this question will vary drastically between a F2P player and myself. But I am looking for some insights from the community. 

At what point do you cave in and invest on an ingredient specialist? And where are you on the F2P‚Äî>Whale scale?

We all pray that the RNG goddess blesses us with a perfect subskill spread on a triple A INGspecialist. But that so rarely happens. 

I myself am still missing an egg specialist and I‚Äôve been hunting for over a year. I have the resources to Level60 a Blissey during the Christmas event, but am I being too picky? 

Should I settle for one of my two AAA Happiny, or do I hold out? With the amount of money I‚Äôve spent on the game, investing resources into something is essentially investing a good amount of cash into them. 

I previously saw a player with a level 60 Ingredient Specialist for each ingredient type, and they typically had only one (rarely two) ING up Subskills/Nature. They were a mostly F2P player.

If you were missing a specialist for a key ingredient that was currently dominating the Meta (e.g. Eggs, Leeks, Tomatoes, Coffee), what would you settle on?

Would you pick a Level30 AAx placeholder with a two or more ING boosts? Or go all in on a level 60 AAA with only one ING boost? Would you keep waiting for the God Roll, or just miss out on that ingredient?

Looking forward to hearing yalls thoughts üòä

1ojekg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ojekg5/hf_a_long_ago_fallen_russia/,[HF] A Long Ago Fallen Russia,"Prologue ‚Äî The Last White

The fire cracked weakly in the iron belly of the stove, its warmth scarcely reaching the frost that silvered the rafters. Outside, the forest pressed in ‚Äî black trunks, blacker shadows, and the hush of snow falling without end. Somewhere in that stillness, a wolf called, its voice thin and far away, like a memory.

Sergei Antonovich Volkov sat at the table, his greatcoat draped over his shoulders, the faded Imperial cockade still pinned to the collar ‚Äî a relic from a world that no longer existed. His beard was white at the edges now, the years having stolen more from him than any bullet could. On the rough boards before him lay a German map, its folds greasy from handling, dotted with his pencil marks ‚Äî villages burned, patrols avoided, men lost.

A young partisan entered, stamping snow from his boots.

‚ÄúTovarishch komandir,‚Äù (Comrade commander,) he said, hesitating at the old word. ‚ÄúNemtsy blizko. Dva kilometra ot reki.‚Äù (The Germans are close. Two kilometres from the river.)

Sergei did not look up. ‚ÄúMy ne tovarishchi. My russkiye.‚Äù (We are not comrades. We are Russians.) He folded the map carefully, as though it were something sacred.

The boy shifted, embarrassed. ‚ÄúDa, gospodin polkovnik...‚Äù (Yes, Colonel...)

‚ÄúNet, ne nazyvay menya tak. Eto imya mertvogo mira.‚Äù (No, don‚Äôt call me that. That name belongs to a dead world.)

A harsh voice from the doorway cut through the quiet ‚Äî German, brisk and metallic.

‚ÄúHerr Wolkow!‚Äù (Mr. Volkov!)

Sergei turned slowly. The Wehrmacht liaison, Hauptmann M√ºller, stood there in his grey coat, snow melting on the brim of his cap. Behind him loomed a translator ‚Äî a thin Baltic man with tired eyes.

‚ÄúDer Oberst bittet Sie, sofort zu kommen.‚Äù (The Colonel requests you come at once.)

The translator murmured in Russian, ‚ÄúPolkovnik vyzyvayet vas, ser.‚Äù (The Colonel summons you, sir.)

Sergei rose, the chair groaning under his weight. ‚ÄúSkazhi yemu, chto ya ne soldat. Ya prikhodzhu tol‚Äôko kogda khochu.‚Äù (Tell him I am no soldier. I come only when I wish.)

M√ºller‚Äôs jaw tightened as the translator relayed the words. The German stared for a long moment, then simply nodded once ‚Äî the way one acknowledges a storm that cannot be reasoned with.

When the door shut, Sergei poured a measure of vodka into a tin cup. The liquid shimmered in the firelight like molten glass.

‚ÄúZa Rossiyu, kotoroy bol‚Äôshe net.‚Äù (To the Russia that no longer exists.)

He drank alone, while outside, the snow kept falling, soft and relentless ‚Äî covering the past, the dead, and the dreams of men who refused to let them go.



Chapter I ‚Äî The Encounter

The village had been dead for months ‚Äî roofs caved in, doors hanging like broken ribs, windows blinded by frost. Only the church still stood, its onion dome scorched black by artillery, the cross at its peak twisted but unfallen. It was there, beneath that cross, that Sergei Volkov waited.

He stood beside the shattered altar, his breath turning to mist. The icons had long since been stripped away, yet the faint scent of incense still clung to the stones ‚Äî a ghost of prayers that no one dared utter now.

Outside, the crunch of boots in the snow. Three figures approached through the pale fog ‚Äî cautious, rifles slung low. When they entered, Sergei saw at once that they were soldiers by bearing, not by uniform. Torn coats, mixed insignia, but eyes that knew the discipline of command.

The first man saluted out of habit. ‚ÄúVy Sergei Volkov?‚Äù (You are Sergei Volkov?)

Sergei nodded. ‚ÄúZavisit ot togo, kto sprashivayet.‚Äù (Depends on who is asking.)

The man smiled faintly. ‚ÄúKapitan Grigori Yelchin, byvshiy ofitser artillerii. My ishchem Russkuyu armiya.‚Äù (Captain Grigori Yelchin, former artillery officer. We‚Äôre looking for the Russian Army.)

Sergei‚Äôs eyes hardened. ‚ÄúRusskoy armii bol‚Äôshe net. Ostalis‚Äô tol‚Äôko my.‚Äù (The Russian Army no longer exists. Only we remain.)

He gestured toward the ruined pews, and they sat, their breath mingling like smoke in the cold air.

Sergei unfolded a tattered map, its edges burnt. ‚ÄúThe Germans will not help us forever,‚Äù he said in English, as if testing them. ‚ÄúThey see us as tools ‚Äî we must become a blade of our own making.‚Äù

Yelchin leaned forward. ‚ÄúMy sobiraem lyudey. Byvshikh ofitserov. Te, kto ne khotyat ni Gitlera, ni Stalina.‚Äù (We are gathering men. Former officers. Those who want neither Hitler nor Stalin.)

‚ÄúI kak vy ikh nakhodite?‚Äù (And how do you find them?) Sergei asked.

Yelchin smiled again ‚Äî tired, almost proud. ‚ÄúMy khodim po selam. Govorim tol‚Äôko odnu frazu: ‚ÄòZa Rossiyu, kotoroy bol‚Äôshe net.‚Äô Esli chelovek otvetyet: ‚ÄòI nikogda ne budet,‚Äô ‚Äî znachit, on s nami.‚Äù

(We go from village to village. We speak one phrase: ‚ÄòFor the Russia that no longer exists.‚Äô If a man answers: ‚ÄòAnd never shall again,‚Äô then he is one of us.)

Sergei‚Äôs expression did not change, but his hand trembled slightly as he touched the map. ‚ÄúEto khorosho. Eto nash znak.‚Äù (That is good. That will be our sign.)

A silence settled over them ‚Äî a pact made not by oath, but by memory. Outside, the wind howled through the empty bell tower, carrying with it the sound of something older than faith ‚Äî the echo of an empire buried beneath the snow.



Chapter II ‚Äî The Double Tongue

They moved through the barracks like ghosts, the winter light pooling on the floorboards and the smell of wet wool thick in the air. Sergei watched them from the shadow of a broken window as the men he and Yelchin had recruited ‚Äî not by oath but by memory ‚Äî learned to bend themselves into other shapes. They wore Red Army tunics now, patched and flayed, their collars turned from the wind and from attention. The uniform was a costume; the posture, the glance, the little private pity for subordinates were the true disguises.

Inside a cramped hut, a lieutenant of the 102nd Rifle Regiment sat with his back to the stove, eyes hollow as if from too many nights without sleep. He had been young enough to fight for a dream and old enough to know it had been stolen. He spoke first without preamble.

‚ÄúVy kazhetsya nam nuzhen, starik.‚Äù (You seem like someone we need, old man.)

Sergei‚Äôs smile was a thin, practiced thing. ‚ÄúMy vse nuzhny drug drugu. Rossiia nuzhdaetsya.‚Äù (We all need each other. Russia needs us.)

Recruitment, in their method, avoided drama. It was a careful choreography of recognition: a phrase uttered at the right time, an offer of bread and a warm place, a quiet question about the old officer‚Äôs regiment or the name of a village now empty. Those who answered with laughter or denial were left alone; those who answered with that particular ache ‚Äî the tiny concession that the past still mattered ‚Äî were given a different look, and a different invitation.

They did not hand out manifestos. They did not draw up lists. They spoke in memories and small proofs: a salute executed wrong, the exact way a certain song ended, the name of a colonel no one else mentioned. It was not skill at deceit that bound them to one another but the mutual refusal to let the old world be effaced without a fight.

When the lieutenant finally asked, almost as if asking himself, ‚ÄúKak my dolzhny zhdat‚Äô ukazaniya?‚Äù (How are we to receive instructions?) Yelchin answered softly, ‚ÄúPokhoronnyye stikhi. Pis‚Äôma bez otkrytykh podpisey. Slova, kotorye ne stoyat nichego dlya drugikh.‚Äù (Funeral verses. Letters without signatures. Words that mean nothing to others.)

Sergei caught the edge in the boy‚Äôs voice and tempered it. ‚ÄúNot codes,‚Äù he said in English, as if to fold a dangerous thing away. ‚ÄúNot maps with arrows. We pass heads, not hands. We pass knowledge: where the pontoon waits a week later, who will be sent to pull the wounded from the road. Names. Times. Little things that make a man look elsewhere when duty demands him.‚Äù

They practised their faces until they were fluent in other sorrows. A supply clerk who once wept at the sight of a church bell now laughed at the commissar‚Äôs jokes. A young sergeant, recruited after a night drinking with Yelchin, learned to whistle the marches the battalion liked and to scold his platoon for slovenliness. He carried with him a slip of paper folded small ‚Äî a name, an hour, a direction. The paper meant nothing except to those who knew to look.

It was the lieutenant who had the courage to ask the question no man liked to voice: ‚ÄúA my peredayom etu informatsiyu nemtsam?‚Äù (And we pass this information to the Germans?) The word hung in the room like smoke.

Sergei met his eyes. ‚ÄúMy ispol‚Äôzuem ikh.‚Äù (We use them.) He did not say the name Hitler. There are limits a man keeps even when he has abandoned nations. ‚ÄúThey hold the maps and the permits. They are the enemy of the Soviets this season. We trade them what we must to buy space to breathe. It is not love, only necessity.‚Äù

Yelchin folded his hands on the table. ‚ÄúKazhdaya informatsiya ‚Äî eto veroyatnost‚Äô. My otnosimsya k ney kak k zhelezku, ne kak k dukhovnomu dukhu.‚Äù (Every piece of information is probability. We treat it like iron, not as a soul.)

Their first meeting with the German liaison was held at dusk, under the ruined bell tower where they had once swore to one another. The Hauptmann arrived with the translator, a man of the Baltic coast whose Russian was soft and precise. The German spoke in clipped tones, the words falling like measured stones into the snow.

‚ÄúHerr Wolkow, wir haben Bedarf an lokalen Nachrichten. Bewegungen, Versorgungswege, Namen.‚Äù (Mr. Volkov, we require local intelligence. Movements, supply routes, names.)

The translator repeated, in Russian, ‚ÄúOn prosit lokalkuyu informatsiyu: peredvizheniya, marshruty snabzheniya, imena.‚Äù (He asks for local information: movements, supply routes, names.) His face was unreadable; he was an instrument, an intermediary who carried speech like a coin.

Sergei answered in Russian, not translating, the words calibrated for both mercy and cruelty. ‚ÄúMy ne rabotaem po rasporyazheniyam. My predlagayem to, chto pozvolit nam sushchestvovat‚Äô. Vy platite‚Äîi my daem to, chto nuzhno. No my ne vashye lyudi. Nikogda.‚Äù (We do not work to orders. We offer what will allow us to exist. You pay‚Äîand we give what you need. But we are never your people. Never.)

The Hauptmann inclined his head. ‚ÄúDas gen√ºgt. Wir wissen den Preis.‚Äù (That will do. We know the price.) The translator mirrored the German into Russian, and in that echo the bargain took shape: information for tacit tolerance, action traded not for allegiance but for room to manoeuvre.

They learned, quickly and bitterly, the cost of such trades. The Germans would take what the cell gave and use it in ways the Whites could not control; sometimes they would turn a report into a slaughter the volunteers had not wished for. At other times, the Germans would leave pockets of the front weak, and the Whites would use those gaps to ferry families away, to hide caches of relics, to move men who refused both ideologies toward the east. Each decision was a tally in a ledger only Sergei could see: advantage scored against conscience, survival balanced against betrayal.

Late one night, after a small victory where a supply convoy was diverted and a company slipped past an outpost, the lieutenant came to Sergei and placed both hands on his shoulders. He whispered, ‚ÄúTy ne boishsya, chto my stanem predateliami?‚Äù (Aren‚Äôt you afraid we shall become traitors?)

Sergei looked at the face of the boy who had once saluted the wrong way and answered, not with doctrine but with the kind of honesty that smells of foxfire and frost. ‚ÄúYa bojus‚Äô. Kazhdyi iz nas dolzhen ponesti etu tyazheluyu ves‚Äô. No esli my ne sdelayem etogo, to chto ostanetsya? Dva tyrana i odna pochti umeravshaya strana?‚Äù (I am afraid. Each of us must bear this heavy weight. But if we do not do this, what remains? Two tyrants and a country nearly dead?)

Outside, the snow closed in on the tracks of men and machines. Inside, they marked time with maps and whispers, with folded paper and the small ritual of language‚ÄîRussian to Russian, German through a translator. They passed secrets like contraband, not trusting the taste of them, but knowing each was a coin to buy another day of existence for a Russia that had already, in its own heart, fallen long ago.



Chapter III ‚Äî The White Silence

The winter of 1944 came down like a sentence.

It did not fall ‚Äî it descended, heavy and patient, grinding colour and sound into the same dim palette of white and steel. In the border forests between Karelia and the frozen lakes, Sergei Volkov and his men moved like smoke between the lines ‚Äî neither German nor Soviet, ghosts with old loyalties and new debts.

The wind had teeth. Frost bloomed on their rifles. Even the breath from their horses turned to glass in the air. They travelled with reindeer-hide skis, scavenged coats, and a flag they dared not raise ‚Äî the tricolour of a Russia that no longer ruled anything but memory.

Yelchin checked the compass, a German issue piece he‚Äôd taken from a dead officer near Smolensk.

‚ÄúMy blizko k Linii Mannergeima. Finny zhdut nas.‚Äù (We are close to the Mannerheim Line. The Finns are waiting for us.)

Sergei nodded. His lips cracked when he spoke.

‚ÄúFinny znayut tol‚Äôko odno ‚Äî sovety ikh vragi. Etogo dostatochno.‚Äù (The Finns know only one thing ‚Äî the Soviets are their enemy. That is enough.)

They reached the Finnish lines after two days of silence, marked only by distant gunfire and the faint green glow of aurora over the treetops.

A sentry‚Äôs voice broke the dark.

‚ÄúPys√§hty√§! Kuka siell√§?‚Äù (Halt! Who goes there?)

A second voice followed, softer, in broken Russian:

‚ÄúKto vy? Druzi ili vragi?‚Äù (Who are you? Friends or enemies?)

Sergei stepped forward, slow and deliberate.

‚ÄúMy vragi ikh vragov. Etogo dolzhno byt‚Äô dostatochno.‚Äù (We are enemies of your enemies. That should be enough.)

After a long pause, the Finns let them through. The men of the frontier were cautious, their faces masked by snow hoods and mistrust. They offered black bread, hot tar coffee, and silence. Around the campfire that night, Sergei studied their discipline ‚Äî quiet, efficient, without slogans. It reminded him of the old Guard regiments before politics had devoured them.

A Finnish captain approached, his Russian fluent but cold as the night.

‚ÄúVy khotite pomoch‚Äô Finlyandii? Ili prosto ubivat‚Äô sovetov?‚Äù (You wish to help Finland? Or simply to kill Soviets?)

Sergei smiled faintly. ‚ÄúYa khotel by pomoch‚Äô Rossii, no yeye uzhe net.‚Äù (I would like to help Russia, but she is gone.)

The captain studied him a long moment, then handed over a folded map.

‚ÄúTogda my imeyem odin i tot zhe tsely.‚Äù (Then we have the same purpose.)

They went to work the next night.

The plan was simple ‚Äî sabotage the Soviet fuel depot beyond the frozen ridge, delay the offensive, and vanish into the forest before dawn.

	They moved under the aurora, that green ghost-light of the north, their skis whispering across crusted snow. When the first guard appeared, Sergei motioned with two fingers; the man fell without a sound. Yelchin‚Äôs breath came out in slow clouds as he set the charges.

‚ÄúSkol‚Äôko vremeni?‚Äù (How long?) Sergei whispered.

‚ÄúDesyat‚Äô minut.‚Äù (Ten minutes.)

The explosion was a muted bloom of orange in the distance, swallowed quickly by snow and night. The depot went up like a dying sun ‚Äî barrels bursting, shadows running. For a heartbeat, the flame reflected in Sergei‚Äôs eyes, and he felt again that impossible ache of pride, as though the fire burned for something sacred.

But then came the echo ‚Äî distant Soviet voices, frantic, confused.

‚ÄúTovarishchi! Pozhar! Vrag v t√Ωle!‚Äù (Comrades! Fire! The enemy is behind us!)

	Gunfire cracked across the ridge. The cell scattered into the trees, shadows among shadows. Two of their number did not return.

By dawn, the forest was still again.

The Finns were gone, their camp erased. Only Sergei and Yelchin remained at the meeting point, breathing frost.

‚ÄúMy sdelali eto.‚Äù (We did it.) Yelchin said.

Sergei nodded, looking east. ‚ÄúDa. No kazhdaya pobeda delaet nas vragami vsego mira.‚Äù (Yes. But every victory makes us enemies of the whole world.)

He turned away as the sun rose ‚Äî pale, indifferent, and cold as the empire he still carried in his heart.



Chapter IV ‚Äî Encirclement of Nations

The world had a way of making a thing intolerable by sheer repetition. Once a whisper crossed a border, it became a dispatch; once a dispatch reached a desk, it became an order. Sergei Volkov and his band existed, night after night, in the grey space between those desks ‚Äî an unwanted footnote that every government found inconvenient and therefore urgent.

They moved like the weather, drifting from one ruin to another, living off silence and old training. Yet the nets had multiplied; they were no longer merely chased by the NKVD‚Äôs cold intelligence. British officers asked for proof in neat hand ‚Äî their memos courteous and grave. American liaisons, through a circuit of cables and interpreters, wanted confirmation before they would pull any strings. The Germans, who had once tolerated Sergei‚Äôs bargains, now treated his men as combustible liabilities. Even the Finns, who had accepted an uneasy camaraderie for the sake of a front, hedged their hospitality with diplomatic caution.

On a bitter morning when the sky seemed scrubbed clean of pity, Sergei sat with Yelchin and three others in the cellar of an abandoned manor. A single lamp cast a pool of yellow that barely held back the dark. They had not slept properly in days; each snatch of rest was another entry in their ledger of fear.

Yelchin rubbed his gloved hands and muttered, ""Vse nashi marshruty prosmotrely. ""(All our routes are watched. They have lists). His voice had the flatness of a man who had counted too many losses. A young courier, Misha, shuffled a packet of folded papers on the table as if its edges might bleed. ""Kto pervyy? Kto iz nas popadet v ruki?"" (Who will be first? Which one of us will fall into their hands?)

Sergei looked at the boy and then at the faces mapped with cold and defiance. He thought of impossible things: the smell of incense in a ruined church, the cadence of an old march, his son‚Äôs small hands. All of that felt like contraband now. He answered quietly, ""My ne peredayom sebe. My ne bezhim. My rabotaem tol‚Äôko tak, kak nuzhno"" (We do not hand ourselves over. We do not run. We work only as we must).

They still had one advantage: ambiguity. To one embassy they were insurgents; to another, bandits; to a third, useful auxiliaries. It was a precarious coin. The British wanted evidence they were not mere collaborators; the Soviets wanted their heads; the Germans wanted them quiet; the Americans wanted alliances untroubled. Each ambition tugged at the men differently, and each tug narrowed the cellar‚Äôs air.

When the British arrived, they brought the weight of tidy paperwork. Two officers in plain greatcoats stepped down the creaking stairs ‚Äî one carrying a leather satchel, the other a tin of tea as if politeness could soften betrayal.

	The senior one addressed him with practiced calm. ‚ÄúColonel Wolkov, we are looking for assurances ‚Äî not loyalty, assurances. That your actions will not imperil broader operations.‚Äù He tapped the papers. ‚ÄúIf you cannot provide these, we must, regrettably, inform our allies that you are a rogue element.‚Äù

Sergei‚Äôs reply was in Russian, low and deliberate. ""Vy khotite uverennost‚Äô. No tol‚Äôko my znaem, kak ee dat‚Äô. Uverennost‚Äô ne prodayotsya. Ona zdes‚Äô, v nashikh glazakh"" (You want assurance. Only we know how to give it. Assurance is not for sale. It sits here, in our eyes). The British officer‚Äôs jaw tightened, but he said nothing more. The air between them froze into understanding: they were enemies by necessity, not conviction.

Word reached them later through a dozen uncertain channels. American intercepts mentioned their names in cautious tones. Berlin demanded arrests ‚Äúto restore order.‚Äù Helsinki turned its back, mumbling about neutrality. Everywhere the same message: irregulars were useful only until they became inconvenient.

	Betrayal did not come as a dagger, but as frost. A merchant bartered names for food; a translator whispered rumours for safety; a German clerk tired of ambiguity filed a report with too much detail. When those papers reached Moscow, they landed on the desk of a commissar who preferred simplicity. His orders were as cold as the season.

At dusk, the trap closed. Radio chatter, cross-border patrols, coded flares ‚Äî three armies moving as if the same hand guided them. When the first of them fell, the forest swallowed the sound. Yelchin‚Äôs breath came ragged. ""My ne smozhem uderzhat‚Äôsya. U nas ostalos‚Äô malenkoye okno"" (We cannot hold. We have a small window left). They slipped into the trees, snow rising to their knees, each step erasing the last.

Behind them came the babel of a world united only in pursuit: German orders, Soviet shouts, Finnish whistles, English radio static. The planet itself had decided that men like them could not exist.

At a river crossing, Sergei stopped. On the opposite bank stood a man in a coat without insignia, face unreadable. His Russian carried an accent that hinted at foreign schools. ""Vy ne pytaetes‚Äô spasti Rossiyu, gospodin Volkov. Vy pytaetes‚Äô vernut‚Äô sebya v mirovoe pokrovenie"" (You are not trying to save Russia, Mr. Volkov. You are trying to return yourself to the world‚Äôs patronage).

Sergei met his eyes and answered softly, ""Mozhet byt‚Äô. No ya delayu eto dlya lyudey, kotorye ne mogut bol‚Äôshe govorit‚Äô za sebya"" (Perhaps. But I do it for those who can no longer speak for themselves).

Then he crossed the ice, each step a quiet defiance. The man did not follow. Behind him the flares burned out, leaving only the colour of smoke. Ahead lay exile, and a map of nations where no flag would ever again claim him.

That night Sergei sat alone beneath a ruined birch and unfolded his small, private map. On it he pencilled crosses for the dead, each with a name. It was not for strategy, but remembrance. He pressed his thumb over one and whispered into the cold, ""Pomni, Rossiya. My vse yeshche pomnim"" (Remember, Russia. We still remember).

And in the silence that followed, even the wind seemed to pause ‚Äî as though the world itself, however briefly, remembered too.



Chapter V ‚Äî The Price of Exile

They were taken in the grey hours before dawn, when the thaw had turned the snow to a grey skin and the world smelled of wet iron. It was not a battle ‚Äî there had been none of the roar or clarity of combat ‚Äî but an operation as quiet and deliberate as a state debt being called in. The men had been moving along a secondary road, dragging a cart of salvaged wood and tins, when the trap closed: a handful of figures who looked like foresters and two who did not look like anyone at all.

One of the strangers had the air of a man who had learned to live in other peoples‚Äô faces. He spoke Russian with a careful, slightly accented consonant, as if he had practised the sound in rooms with maps on the walls. ""My tol‚Äôko kupim derevo i proydem dal‚Äôshe"" (We only buy wood and move on), the courier protested, his hands up in a mute plea against rifles. The stranger smiled as if pity were a tool. ""Pomogite nam, i my pomozhem vam."" (Help us, and we will help you.) By the time the sun bled a pale through the trees, Sergei understood how the bargain had been arranged: a whisper in a tavern; a small sack of money; a promise of safe passage that had been sold twice over.

They moved like a convoy of prisoners through a landscape that remembered them. The men in plain coats carried no badges that anyone could swear to; one wore a suit too fine for the place and an English collar faint under his scarf. He spoke English later, in measured sentences, the kind of measured sentences that take the shape of policy papers. He never raised his voice. When he addressed Sergei in Russian, a translator ‚Äî a Baltic √©migr√© whose loyalty had been bought with promises and fear ‚Äî made the words even and soft. ""Vi byli zamedleny, gospoda. Eto ne kakoy-to sredi net iz kukhni"" (You were observed, gentlemen. This is not some kitchen quarrel).

They were exfiltrated along a route that read like a map of concessions: across the river at night where the patrols were thinnest, into a Finnish outpost that took a fee and pretended not to look, then into Sweden, where for a week they sat in a pension by a harbour and watched gulls take the winter‚Äôs last scraps from the water. Rumours of their capture moved like oil on the surface of a continent; by the time they were taken to the ship bound for Scotland, the world had already assigned them a shape ‚Äî collaborators, rogues, potential tools.

On the passage, the Englishman explained, in English, why they had been taken. The words were precise, as if cut from legal paper: the Allies needed men who understood the Soviet rear, men who could direct sabotage, who could speak to displaced units and to men with loyalties that were older and stranger than current maps allowed. In return, they offered a form of mercy: service under British colors; shelter, if they complied; and the protection of a state that could be as ruthless in policy as any commissar.

When Sergei asked what would happen if they refused, the Englishman‚Äôs face did not harden but the sentence did, like winter into ice. ""You will be handed across the line."" The translator rendered it: ""Vas peredayut tem, kto imeet na vas protivopolozhnye zakony."" (You will be handed to those whose laws go against you.) The implication was clear without being crude: to be turned back would be to accept the court of the enemy, and in that court their crimes ‚Äî sabotage, collaboration, the murder of men in uniform ‚Äî were likely to lead to swift and fatal judgment.

They were in England before they had time to learn the smell of the sea at sunrise. Britain received them with the brisk courtesy of a power practised in making bargains. Men in khaki measured them with eyes that had seen too many theatres; officers in dress uniforms took notes; an intelligence committee ‚Äî a small room with a long table and longer silences ‚Äî asked why they had not simply fled east, why they had made alliances they could not keep, why they had chosen to be ghosts.

The offer, when it came, was made as if it were the most natural of things. Serve as strategic officers and sabotage specialists. Use your knowledge of the Soviet rear to direct operations that the Allies could not admit to with any public decency. Train saboteurs, run false units, advise on collapses to manufacture ‚Äî all the bitter crafts of modern warfare. In exchange: identity papers, a place in the Army, ranks commensurate with usefulness, perhaps even a future in which they would not be dragged back to a tribunal.

There was an additional, almost ceremonial element in Sergei‚Äôs case. The men with the sharp coats had found in him a certain authority: a way of looking at maps as if they contained prayers, a steadiness under questioning that passed as command. He had never asked for rank; he had always carried a dead one in memory. One evening, after a long debriefing, an officer said plainly, ""We can give you the means to act on what you believe in. But to do so effectively you will need authority here. You will be accepted into our service, and with it a rank ‚Äî temporary, but real"". The offer hung in the lamplight like an omen.

He thought then of the men he had lost, of the cart left by the roadside, of the two who had been sacrificed to buy time. He thought of the tricolour he had kept next to his chest like a fossil. When he finally responded, his Russian was a thin thing. ""Ya prinyal by lubuyu formu pomoshchi dlya togo, chtoby ne zabyvat‚Äô ikh"" (I would accept any form of help to ensure they are not forgotten). The translator repeated the words into English and the men at the table moved as if closing an account.

The commissions were planned with the bureaucratic care of a marriage contract: a ceremonial roll of papers, the stamping of seals, the careful wording that made an enemy a tool of the same alphabet. Sergei was given the highest rank among them not as flattery but as function: brigadier ‚Äî a title heavy with command and with an expectation that he could bend men to action. The rank was temporary, local to the units he would advise; it came with a uniform cut at a tailor‚Äôs in London and with a list of responsibilities that smelled faintly of explosives and maps.

There was no rejoicing. The promotion did not make the past lighter. In the mirror that evening, the dark circles under his eyes looked like medals. Yelchin and the others were given lesser ranks, appropriate to the tasks they would perform: intelligence officers, liaison captains, instructors for sabotage. Each appointment carried with it the same unspoken clause: serve, and you live in a world of service that will never be public; refuse, and the world will hand you back to the one that had always made its punishments simple.

They trained in the chalky camps of Britain, in barns that smelled of straw and coal and British rain. They learned the Allied methods of demolition, of setting charges that would collapse a supply bridge rather than burn a village. They argued long into the night about targets, about honour, about whom they might save by making ruin elsewhere. Sergei taught them, too, how to read the weary soldier‚Äôs face ‚Äî how to press a question and let a man confess what he might not have admitted even to himself.

There were nights when the weight of the bargain pressed like iron across his chest. He‚Äôd walk in rain, the collar of his coat turned up against a sky that never quite matched the maps in his hands, and wonder whether the men he had been ‚Äî imperial officers who had once marched under banners that promised a different order ‚Äî had simply changed the theatre of their exile. He had not forgiven himself for the things he had done to keep men alive; now he was being asked to commit other kinds of violence for other causes, wearing the colours of another patron.

And yet there was a grim logic to it. The world that had hunted them with such unanimity had offered them one narrow door. Behind that door was a strange kind of agency: to direct sabotage that might shorten a front, to help families slip away, to mark for rescue those whose names had been erased. Sergei accepted the brigadier‚Äôs epaulettes not as a triumph but as a ledger item ‚Äî a new line in the account that had been opened the day the first man fell at the ford.

When his name was written in official hand and the ink dried, he found himself worrying about small things once more. How would his men speak of him when the radios went silent? Would history call him traitor or saviour? The Englishmen with their clipped vowels did not care for such distinctions; they offered effectiveness, paper, and routes. They offered survival on terms that were nakedly pragmatic.

The night before he was formally sworn in, Sergei unrolled his private map. He placed a pencil cross where each name lay and, for the first time since the capture, allowed himself to think of a future that might include movement rather than only hiding. He put his thumb to the tricolour sewn into the inside of his greatcoat and whispered, ""Pomni"" (Remember). Then he folded the map small and slept in a room that smelled faintly of coal and sea-spray, the brigadier‚Äôs uniform hanging like a shadow in the corner.



Chapter VI ‚Äî The Last Command

They came for him before dawn.

The cell door opened with the quiet precision of men who had already rehearsed his end. Two guards stepped in, NKVD insignia dull under the lamp light. The officer followed ‚Äî the same one who had offered him the deal days before. He carried no papers this time, only the weary air of someone confirming an outcome.

Sergei rose slowly. His uniform, though British-cut, hung loose from days of fever and neglect. The wound at his shoulder ached, a cold pulse that had long since replaced pain with numbness.

""Vy ponimayete svoyu situatsiyu, brigadir."" (You understand your situation, Brigadier.)

Sergei nodded once.

""Ponimayu."" (I understand.)

The officer‚Äôs gaze lingered. ‚ÄúYou could still serve. No one would know. You would live, perhaps even be repatriated after the war.‚Äù

Sergei almost smiled ‚Äî a thin, weary curve of the mouth.

""Zhit‚Äô bez vernosti ‚Äî eto uzhe ne zhizn‚Äô."" (To live without loyalty ‚Äî that is no life.)

The officer‚Äôs expression flickered; not pity, not respect, but a faint recognition that some men could not be moved.

‚ÄúSo be it,‚Äù he said simply.

The morning was colourless. A thin mist hung over the yard of the makeshift prison outside Arkhangelsk, where half-collapsed wooden sheds served as both barracks and gallows. The snow had turned grey with soot from the fires. Sergei was led across the yard without ceremony, boots crunching on frost-hardened ground.

Yelchin‚Äôs grave ‚Äî or what passed for one ‚Äî lay somewhere under that same earth. Sergei thought of it without sentiment. Men died; what mattered was how they did it.

They bound his hands loosely, as though even the guards knew there was no need for struggle. A priest approached, his breath white in the air, holding a small wooden cross. Sergei shook his head.

""Ya uzhe ispovedovalsya, otets. Mnogie razy."" (I have already confessed, Father. Many times.)

	The man bowed and stepped aside.

The NKVD officer read from a small notebook, voice steady and bureaucratic. The charges sounded almost absurd in their litany ‚Äî espionage, sabotage, collaboration, treason ‚Äî words that had already lost meaning in a world where loyalty was merely a question of who held the rope.

When the list ended, Sergei spoke, his voice rough but clear.

""Rossiya ne propala iz-za nas, a iz-za tekh, kto zabyl yeye dushu."" (Russia did not fall because of us, but because of those who forgot her soul.)

No one translated it. No one needed to.

They placed the rope around his neck. The cold hemp bit into the skin just above his collar. For a moment, Sergei‚Äôs eyes drifted upward to the pale morning sky ‚Äî neither grey nor blue, just the colour of endings. He thought of Petrograd before the banners, of his mother‚Äôs silver icons, of the frozen forests where men like him still waited for a country that would never return.

Then he straightened his back. The brigadier once more.

""Vypolnyaite prikaz."" (Carry out the order.)

The trap gave way.

There was no sound but the creak of rope and the slow sigh of the northern wind through the yard. The guards stood still. The officer closed his notebook and turned away, murmuring to no one in particular:

‚ÄúEven the dead can be loyal.‚Äù

By noon, Sergei Volkov was officially erased ‚Äî another nameless enemy, recorded and forgotten in a war that devoured its own children.

But among a handful of captured British files in Moscow, one document remained unburned:

‚ÄúBrigadier Sergei Volkov ‚Äî attached to Special Operations, deceased in the field.‚Äù

The line was signed, stamped, and filed under Personnel: Missing, presumed heroic.

I (20 f) am a sort of freelancer, my last boss called me to ask me to come help for two week (with pay, the work is pretty specific and recognizable so I will not detail)

my boss has left for vacation a couple days ago, so one of my older coworker(30 m) just gives me the assignments, the problem started a couple days ago when he gave me a ride and started touching my thigh, now my industry is pretty male centered so I'm honestly pretty used to stuff like that even though it already started making me incredibly uncomfy, but a day later I finished all my assignments and my friends from work wanted to go for coffee together, at that time my coworker decided to go buy lunch and told me to wait for him to show him my work so he would ok it, he came back an hour later, I told him I finished everything and was planning on heading out, he told me I can't bc he wants to give me some of his work load, I said ok tell me what to do and ill do it fast (ill be honest I was probably visibly annoyed) he told me to wait bc he's eating, I waited, 30 minutes, my friends left, another 10, I go  look for him, he's doing nothing, I ask him to pls just give e the work bc I don't like just waiting and not doing anything, another 10 minutes, he comes and gives e the files, I finish the work in 10 minutes, I go home.

a day later I come early and he tells me to transfer all the files I worked on to him, I thought it was probably just so he can fix any mistakes to not waste time, he takes me aside to have a conversation, he says he feels I'm not being a good partner bc yesterday I wanted to get the files work and go home, I tell him this is work why wouldn't I? he says it looks like I don't want to work, Im baffled, he says that if I don't start acting like a ""partner"" he will convince my boss to end my contract early (they're friends), I'm terrified, and don't know what to say, I later find out he told other people that I don't work at all (I finished more projects than anyone in the office), I cry on my way to work bc I realize my memories of the place are now only uncomfortable and sad.

I come today and try to just work, he moves me from my station to sit with him so he can check on me, my friend comes to sit with us, I try to show him my work to get an ok, he doesn't even look at the screen, now even my friend is uncomfortable bc something just feels weird, a work day that was supposed to be 6 hours turned into 10, before I go home he tells me tomorrow I need to stay with him in the office late, I tell him I can't as I have another job at that time (something my boss is very much aware of) he says he doesn't care and I have to do it. now ill be honest in the last couple of days I was probably way more passive aggressive than I should have been, and I can't perceive my self from the outside so maybe I even offended him, but am I the asshole here? and would I be the asshole if I just leave?

[multi-paragraph]","This is heavily inspired by Supernatural, although I don‚Äôt plan on having canon characters actually appear!
I know this is long, but there‚Äôs a lot of world building and scene setting, the plot itself is quite straightforward actually! :)

Pairing: Rookie (f) x Hunter (a)

Post style: 250-350 words, 3rd person, past tense.

Plot: Supernatural / small-town mystery / slow-burn partnership / modern day

Wrenfield, Minnesota. A small town tucked between cold lakes and a wall of pine forest. Around three thousand people live there. It‚Äôs the kind of place where everyone knows each other‚Äôs routines and where the fog never really lifts off. There‚Äôs one stoplight, a diner with a flickering neon sign, and a main street. Most people keep their heads down and mind their business.

The Boundary Woods stretch around town, broken up only by one big road and a few game trails. Locals don‚Äôt go too deep. Over the last few months, hunters, campers, and even a couple of hikers have gone missing. Their camps are found ripped apart, their vehicles still there, but no bodies. The sheriff blames wild animals. The locals say the woods have always had a bad feeling to them.

Old stories talk about strange lights in the trees and voices that sound like someone you know calling you. There‚Äôs also the old paper mill by the lake that closed twenty years ago after an ‚Äúaccident.‚Äù Nobody says what really happened there, but people still cross themselves when they drive past it.

Sheriff Tom Grady tries to keep things quiet. His deputy, Claire Rosten, thinks something else is going on. She‚Äôs noticed the disappearances happen in the same area, right near the northern lake. The police radios cut out there too, replaced by static and faint whispers.

Months back, a stranger came through town. Middle-aged, quiet, carried a worn notebook. He wasn't there to camp or hike, he asked questions about the disappearances and spent time around the woods. A detective from a big city, he said. Folks remember seeing his truck parked near the old logging road. After a few days, he was gone and search parties found nothing. People stopped talking about it and went on with their lives.

Now, new faces have shown up in Wrenfield, digging for the same information.


**Characters**

Taylor Rhodes is a redhead of 5'6"", with a statue not hardened or filled out with lean muscle by hunting yet. She is curious, idealistic, and still believes in the good of the world. She got the training and theoretical knowledge, sure, but this would be her first field experience. She didn't care to show off or actually prove herself to anyone, no, she just wants to stop whatever got her old man before returning to civilian life. Early 20s

The Hunter:
Well! That is up to you! Maybe a friend of her father? Someone who was mentored by him? Maybe he doesn‚Äôt have much of a connection to the father but to the town instead? Please include your ideas for the character in your first message :)


**Wrenfield, Minnesota**

**Location**
Two hours north of Duluth. The town sits between three lakes and a stretch of pine forest called the Boundary Woods. Winters are long, summers short, and the weather always feels like it‚Äôs about to rain.

**Population**
Around 1,800. Most people were born here. Outsiders draw attention without meaning to.

**Town Layout**
Main Street has a diner, a hardware store, a laundromat, and a bar. A single stoplight blinks yellow at night. Things don‚Äôt change much, and folks like it that way.

**Key Locations**

**Wrenfield Lake**
The lake never fully freezes, even in the coldest winters. People say the ice ‚Äúbreathes.‚Äù Fishermen still leave coins on the dock before heading out, but nobody can say where the tradition started.

**The Paper Mill**
Closed in 2003. Kids sneak in after dark, claiming to hear the old machines running. The sheriff says it‚Äôs wind through the vents. Nobody‚Äôs checked in years.

**Boundary Woods**
A dense pine forest north of town. Phone signals vanish past the treeline and hunters talk about paths that twist in on themselves.

**Harper‚Äôs Diner**
A narrow building with fogged windows and strong coffee. June Harper has run it for forty years and knows everyone‚Äôs business.

**Lundgren‚Äôs bar**
Across from the lake. There‚Äôs a faded photo behind the bar showing strange lights over the water in 1998. The owner, Frank Lundgren, calls it a camera trick, but it's been there for so long, he doesn't see the point in taking it down.

**The Wrenfield Public Library**
A small brick building beside the post office. The basement houses old county records and a collection of local folklore, most of it handwritten. The librarian, Ms. Dwyer, says the stories go back before the town was founded. It doubles as an archive.

**The Hollow Pine Motel**
Eight rooms, all with wood-paneled walls and buzzing neon out front. Travelers stay a night, sometimes two. Locals say the place has been ‚Äúoff‚Äù since a trucker disappeared there in the nineties. Room 3 is always colder than the rest.


**People**

**Town Officials and Law Enforcement**

Sheriff Tom Grady - Mid-50s. Even-tempered and quietly stubborn. Keeps the peace with a steady hand. Keeps two logbooks: one for official reports, one for the things that don't make sense.

Deputy Claire Rosten - Early 30s. New to Wrenfield, transferred from Duluth. Pragmatic and sharp, but unsetled by how the radio cuts out near the lake.

**Local Landmarks & Businesses**

June Harper - Runs Harper‚Äôs Diner. Late 60s, chain-smoker, knows every rumor in town. Keeps a pinboard of pictures and notes from travelers who‚Äôve passed through.

Frank Lundgren - Owner of Lundgren‚Äôs Bar. Former logger, gruff but soft-spoken. Lost his brother on the lake in ‚Äô98, though no one found a body.

Marlene Dwyer - Librarian at Wrenfield Public Library. Mid-50s, quiet, always wears thick wool sweaters. Knows more about the town‚Äôs past than she admits.

Ed and Bonnie Haskell - Owners of the Hollow Pine Motel. Married forty years. Bonnie handles the front desk, Ed does maintenance.

Martin ‚ÄúMarty‚Äù Olsen - Runs Olsen‚Äôs Hardware. Veteran, widower, and amateur radio enthusiast. Claims he once picked up voices on his set from somewhere ‚Äúin these damned woods.‚Äù

Caleb Dorn - Mechanic at the auto shop. Barely speaks, always listening to old country music. Has a claw mark on his arm he won‚Äôt explain.

**Community Figures**

Pastor Raymond Keller - Lutheran pastor. In his 60s. Kind, but worn down. Has a quiet understanding with Sheriff Grady about what not to report.

Ruth Keller - The pastor‚Äôs wife. Runs the church bake sales and food drives. She sees things in her dreams that sometimes come true. Her husband calls it a blessing from God.

Jackie Brant - Bartender at Lundgren‚Äôs Tavern. In her 20s, grew up in Wrenfield and wants to leave but hasn‚Äôt yet.

Jonas Pike - Retired mail carrier. Walks the same route every morning even though he‚Äôs been retired for ten years. Says the woods have ‚Äúgood and bad paths.‚Äù


**Creatures**

**The Drowned One**

Spirit tied to Wrenfield Lake. People drown in calm water, and bodies turn up miles from where they went under. Locals say the lake doesn‚Äôt freeze because ‚Äúit‚Äôs still breathing.‚Äù The spirit mimics voices from under the ice and sometimes knocks from below boats.

**The Wending Light**

Strange orbs seen in the Boundary Woods or over the water. Usually pale blue or white. They move against the wind and vanish when approached. Hunters and hikers who follow them sometimes don‚Äôt come back. People claim to hear whispering when the lights appear.

**The Hollow Man**

A figure seen around town after funerals or accidents. Tall, thin, face indistinct. After sightings, one or two people close to the deceased start acts, or walking at night. No one agrees on what it wants.

**The Keeper**

Said to live deep in the Boundary Woods. Locals describe hearing footsteps behind them or seeing animal tracks that circle their own. Some hunters talk about finding their own spent shells arranged in a line. The forest feels wrong for days afterward.

**The Caller**

Old logging camp legend. A voice that calls people by name from the treeline at dusk. The sound is familiar; a friend, a parent, someone trusted. If answered, it comes closer. If ignored, it waits.

**The Ridgeback**

A huge predator said to roam the deep Boundary Woods. Taller than a bear, fast and quiet. Tracks show too many toes. The woods go silent when it‚Äôs near. Hunters talk about seeing a ridge of quills down its back, catching the light before it disappears again.


**Starter**

Taylor‚Äôs leg bounced in rhythm with the music from her earplug as she sat in the old booth. The leather was soft from use, but she didn‚Äôt pay much mind to it. No, her attention was glued to the notebook and laptop in front of her. Her eyes flew over the webpage as she read the recent missing person reports. 

She hadn‚Äôt thought she‚Äôd ever be in this position. Researching for a case she‚Äôd be personally involved in. The most she‚Äôs witnessed had been stories her father told her when she was young. Weapon training, well, shooting, as he didn‚Äôt want her to get close enough to need a knife. A little bit of research here and there, sure. After all, it was more believable when a young girl asked about ghost stories for a school paper than whatever role her father could‚Äôve played. It helped that she looked trustworthy, as friends of the family, other hunters, have told her. 

Of course Taylor knew what that meant. She didn‚Äôt look like a hunter, which she was more than fine with. This wasn‚Äôt her world and that was evident. The only battlescar she could speak of was on her hand, from when she lost the fight against a broken glass jar at the age of eight. She liked to think of it as a draw, as she still got it open, even if in many more pieces than necessary. 

Green eyes met watery gray ones, surrounded by blue metallic liner Taylor hasn‚Äôt seen since the early 00‚Äôs, as June, the owner and waitress of Harper‚Äôs Diner, refilled her coffee cup. 

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Taylor said with a polite smile, instinctively flipping to another page in her notebook. Something not about wendigos or bigfoots. Townsfolk already talked about her, a stranger looking for another stranger that went missing, and she didn‚Äôt need the gossip to get worse. 

Just a city girl looking for her father, who was a detective this time around. That should be gossip enough for these people, the redhead thought.",1,1761766819.0,OriginalCharacter_RP,2,0.67,False

One thing to keep in mind is that compatibilists agree that determinism is true.

------------

Compatibilism tries to reconcile determinism with free will.
It says: even if determinism is true, we can still be free ‚Äî just in a different sense.

	‚Ä¢	How?
Compatibilists redefine ‚Äúfree will‚Äù to mean acting according to your own desires, intentions, and reasoning, without external coercion, even if those desires themselves have deterministic causes.

	‚Ä¢	Example:
You chose coffee because you wanted coffee, not because someone forced you.
Even if that ‚Äúwant‚Äù was determined by your biology or past, the choice still expresses your will ‚Äî so it‚Äôs free in the compatibilist sense.

-------------

Determinism is the view that every event (including human actions, thoughts, and choices) is the inevitable result of prior causes ‚Äî like a chain of dominoes.
In other words, given the state of the universe at one time and the laws of nature, everything that happens afterward is fixed.

	‚Ä¢	Example:
If you chose coffee this morning, that choice was caused by your brain chemistry, past experiences, preferences, and circumstances ‚Äî not by pure ‚Äúfree will.‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	Implication:
True freedom (in the sense of being able to have done otherwise) doesn‚Äôt exist.

-------------

So if you admit that your desires, intentions and reasoning were determined (by external factors and genetics), then by extent you acting on them is also determined (by external factors and genetics). So where's the freedom in that? If you're not free to choose your desires and how you act upon them, where is the freedom?

Approximately 59% to 63% of philosophers are compatibilists, meaning they believe free will and determinism are compatible. All these guys are actually hard determinists. 

Only about 10-12% of philosophers hold the hard determinist view that there is ""no free wil"". 

So that makes around 70-75% hard determinists which means hard determinism wins. 

----------

Compatibilism redefines free will:

	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs not about breaking the chain of cause and effect.

	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs about acting according to your own desires, intentions, and reasoning, without being forced or coerced. (WHAT!?!?!?!?, lol, you ARE BEING FORCED, but subtly, so subtly that you think YOU make these choices) 

‚Ä¢	A compatibilist would reply: ‚ÄúYes, but you still acted freely because you chose what you wanted ‚Äî nobody made you do it.‚Äù - your past experiences MADE YOU WANT IT AND MADE YOU DO IT. Why is it so hard to understand???

Every table, every press booth, every delegation row bore the marks of rivalry. Behind the cheers and smiles lay a storm. The Western Winds were gathering into a black mass. He adjusted his tie and stepped to the podium. The sea of banners seemed to sway as if holding its breath. **Cameras flashed, the crowd quieted, and the gavel struck thrice**.

‚Äú**Delegates of the Homeland Party**,‚Äù Roosevelt began, his voice firm yet resonant, ‚Äú**our Republic stands at the forefront of a great odyssey once more.**‚Äù

The 99 ballots of the previous Homeland National Convention was still fresh in the minds of every delegate in that Convention Hall. Luckily, unlike 1924, the two main frontrunners had revealed themselves in the first few ballots. Representatives **Cordell Hull and Hamilton Fish III emerged as the two candidates blessed by the gods in the early race**. Representing the bickering sides of the America Forward Caucus, the largest caucus in national politics, their influence signified the reach of the Caucus itself and how far it's grasp spanned within the party. In third, the ascendant supporters of author Albert Jay Nock had soared further than they themselves even expected. Outpacing the establishment endorsed Texas Governor Dan Moody, the ""**libertarians**"" found themselves in a position of kingmaker between the warring Hull and Fish camps, a position more comfortable than being blown out of the water outright.

Roosevelt sat watching on. Tense, yet stoic. **He knew that he couldn't again let this party dwell into a massive stalemate**; it would ruin the illusion of the unity and cohesion that the party so desperately wanted to achieve. In the midst of the chaos, Roosevelt sat down with Minutemen leader General Douglas MacArthur for a chat. MacArthur withdrew himself and his Minutemen away from this Convention, recognizing the chaos it may bring if another dramatic draw were to occur. ""Who do you support, Douglas?"", Roosevelt questioned while sipping a cup of coffee. ""Honestly, I was hoping for Moody to win an easy victory; however now I see that won't happen."", Douglas replied stiffly.  ""I expected Governor Moody to win handily as well,"" Roosevelt admitted, ""however it seems Cordell's Caucus holds a substantial amount of power in this party."".  ""Mhm,"", MacArthur agreed, ""I am honestly alright with either Cordell or Fish. But if I were a delegate voting, I'd write my ballot for ""THEODORE ROOSEVELT JR."" and announce it to the world."". Roosevelt almost choked on his coffee. ""Me? Why so? Why me?"", Roosevelt scurried. ""Well,"" MacArthur said stretching his arms, ""who else is popular enough to win? Your Smith-loving cousin?"". **MacArthur walked away chuckling, leaving Roosevelt stunned**. 

Meanwhile, the Hull and Fish camps were at each other's throats. Both men had made a personal appearance in the Convention, rallying their delegates further and further, trying to outpace the other. Hull had written multiple ravenous letters decrying Fish's position in the interventionist movement, dubbing him ""**ruthless and reckless**"", while Fish himself snapped back with a grassroots adverting campaign depicting America's supposed prestige to be gained under his possible administration. Herbert Hoover, who was attending the convention and who himself garnered some delegate votes due to his sheer popularity, began to distance himself **from the rather scorching methods of in-person campaigning happening in the convention**.

As the ballots neared the 20s, it seemed at each candidate had reached their glass ceiling. The one thing everyone had feared had been basically realized: a deadlock. The inner workings of the party immediately went into crisis mode to try to remedy the situation. Chairman Roosevelt took the helm, sprinting into action, **sending a letter to a frequent penpal of his in a bid to crack the deadlock**. Meanwhile, talk within the party of this stalemate spurred across the Convention Floor like a constant scream. Hull remained confident at-face value, however was sweating bullets behind closed doors, trying to strategize how to secure a victory. Meanwhile, Fish was running around like a madman, trying to pull every card from all orifices of his body to secure more support. Hull certainly played his cards more skillfully than Fish, utilizing his political capitol within the America Forward Caucus as its leader to leverage more and more support‚Äîwhile Fish's faction began to cannibalize itself. 

Hull began to rise at the expense of Fish, however still not enough to secure the necessary delegates to win. With the room at a standstill, Hull was suddenly pushed into a backroom to discuss with a certain political behemoth that could make or break his campaign. **The clock is ticking faster and faster.**

A group of boys would begin handing out letters to the people of the convention. Hamilton Fish III was sitting down at rest after stressfully campaigning the whole day. However, that break would be cut short from the scurried voice for one of his aides yelling ""Mr. Fish! Mr. Fish!"". Fish was about to lose his temper. He let out a sigh and asked ""What is it?!"". He was handed a copy of that letter. He face would turn white. He couldn't believe his eyes. ""**A STATEMENT FROM MR. ALBERT NOCK: I WHOLEHEARTLEDLY ENDORSE MR. CORDELL HULL OF TENNESSEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.**""

Nock had squeezed Hull of everything he could've possibly gotten. In their negotiations, Hull promised Nock both a cabinet position and a endorsement of some of Nock's ""libertarian"" policies. Nock had seen Hull as the lesser evil between the two frontrunners, Fish in his eyes being to sympathetic to President Smith's costly spending programs and overreaching policies. While Hull wasn't exactly ideal, he was flexible enough whereas Nock could achieve major concessions to ensure his ideals would still win out. Meanwhile, Chairman Roosevelt patted himself on the back‚Äîin his eyes saving the party's reputation going into the election. **With Nock's endorsement, fate was sealed, and Hull was triumphant.**

‚Äú*My dear friends, the great delegates to this great party, and to esteemed Chairman,*

*I appreciate the willingness of you all to stand here in this battle for the party nomination with such cordial respect and dignity for each other. First and foremost, I would like to thank the ever-so-present grace of our Lord God for blessing this convention and the people within it. It is through His providence that we stand not as divided men and women, but as Americans united in purpose and principle...*

*My heart is full tonight‚Äînot with pride, but with gratitude. Gratitude to the countless citizens who have written to me from the hills of Tennessee to the mills of Pennsylvania; to the farmers of the South and the workers of the North, who still believe that America‚Äôs best days are ahead of her. I accept this nomination not as a crown, but as a burden of duty‚Äîa duty to restore our people‚Äôs confidence in themselves and in their Republic...*

*We are gathered here in a time of great trial. The burdens of the recent economic collapse weigh heavily upon the backs of our working men and women. Families have lost their livelihoods, cities have lost their vigor, and faith in our institutions has begun to falter. Let us be frank with one another, my friends‚Äîthe complete failure of the administration of the Visionaries must be recognized. It is not bitterness that makes me say so, but responsibility. The American people deserve honesty, not politeness, in the face of suffering. We cannot correct our course until we admit how far we have drifted...*

*But despair is not destiny. Ours is a nation built upon renewal, upon self-correction, upon the eternal belief that Providence favors the just and the industrious. To mend this great Republic, we must first restore trust‚Äîtrust between government and people, between labor and business, between community and country. Saving our economy must be done through carefully considered investment and global cooperation. America cannot retreat from the world; she must engage with it wisely, deliberately, and confidently...*

*We are, my friends, the inheritors of a sacred trust‚Äîdemocracy itself. And I say to you tonight, from this stage before God and country, that democracy must be protected at all costs. Whether threatened by tyranny abroad or despair at home, we shall not yield. The spirit of the American citizen, that sacred belief that liberty and self-governance belong to all men, is the light that must never be dimmed...*

*We must look outward, not inward. The world stands divided by greed, ambition, and the shadows of new empires rising. We must not isolate ourselves within fortress walls of fear, but instead raise bridges of understanding. To foster a harmonious world order, in which all middle powers can fight against the opportunistic greed of predatory states, and secure for themselves peace, trade, and justice, that is the calling of the modern age...*

*Let no man mistake cooperation for weakness. The power of a free and united people, acting with prudence and purpose, can shape the destiny of nations. America must lead not by domination, but by example‚Äîby her industry, her ideals, and her integrity...*

*At home, our recovery must be rooted in reality, not rhetoric. We must rebuild our economy not upon speculation, but upon solid foundation‚Äîupon the soil, the plow, and the sweat of honest work. Government cannot be the sole engine of prosperity, but it can be its steward and protector. Let us use common sense and business sense. Just as one example, we know that a very hopeful and immediate means of relief, both for the unemployed and for agriculture, lies in expanding our internal improvements, rebuilding our roads, revitalizing our rails, and reopening the arteries of commerce that bind this great continent together...*

*We must not abandon the farmer, who feeds our people and sustains our land. We must not neglect the worker, whose hands keep our factories alive. And we must not forget the entrepreneur, whose courage fuels innovation. Prosperity must not be a privilege‚Äîit must be a partnership...*

*My friends, this is not merely a campaign‚Äîit is a crusade for renewal. Our generation stands at a crossroads: to retreat into fear or to stride forward in faith. I choose faith‚Äîin our people, in our Constitution, in our Creator. We shall weather this storm not by tearing one another down, but by lifting one another up...*

*Let history record that in this hall, at this hour, the Homeland Party rededicated itself to the true spirit of America: liberty with responsibility, faith with reason, and progress with principle. We have endured the fire before, and we will endure it again, for this nation‚Äôs soul is tempered in trial. Throughout the nation, men and women, forgotten in the political philosophy of the government of the last years look to us here for guidance and for more equitable opportunity to share in the bounties of our capitalist system...*

*So let us go forth‚Äînot as partisans, but as patriots. Let us bring hope to the forgotten, light to the weary, and dignity to the struggling. Let us restore America‚Äôs faith in herself. And together, under God, we shall build not merely a recovery, but a rebirth of the American dream.*

*Thank you, my friends. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.*‚Äù

The party plank would soon be adopted. **Promising large government supporting to struggling businesses and sectors, promotion of free trade, reversal of the Smith administration large bureaucratic machine, an anti-corruption crackdown, the pursuit of a ""Good Neighbor Policy"", and a withdrawal of government overreach to ensure a barrier of sovereignty of the states among others in a long list**. Once the congratulatory applauses and cheers died down, Hull made his move to appease factions within his newly christened party. Already taming the libertarians, Hull shifted to the faction of his old rival to lure back. Fish had already accepted his defeat, however would absolute refuse a spot as Hull's running mate in the general election, thus Hull had to promote someone else to ensure that he didn't seem soft on foreign policy. Hull would ask 74-year old hero of both the War of the Continental Alliance and the Revolutionary Uprising Major General **Tasker H. Bliss** as his running mate. Bliss had been a compatriot of both former Presidents Adna Chaffee and Thomas Custer respectively and was a folk hero to interventionists and isolationists alike. Bliss, who had plans to run in the Pennsylvania Senate election, accepted Hull's proposal. **The ticket was born to burn out the scourge of the Smith administration was formed**.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Lakers vs. Timberwolves: The Injured Symphony of Scoring Chaos**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The Los Angeles Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves are set to collide in a game that reads like a cast of *The Walking Dead* if the Walking Dead played basketball. Both teams are missing key players, but somehow, Austin Reaves has turned into a one-man fireworks show. Let‚Äôs parse the odds, digest the chaos, and find the best same-game parlay to bet on this dumpster fire of a matchup.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Carnival of Absences

The Lakers (2-2) are missing LeBron James (sciatic nerve pain), Luka Doncic (trade-related existential crisis?), and Gabe Vincent, while Marcus Smart and Jaxson Hayes are questionable. The Timberwolves (2-2) are without Anthony Edwards (hamstring) and Enrique Freeman, but Jaden McDaniels and Julius Randle have stepped up like overeager interns at a coffee shop.

**Key Stats**:

* **Austin Reaves**: The Lakers‚Äô new ""franchise player"" (if ""player"" means ""human highlight reel""). He‚Äôs averaging **35.8 PPG** over two games since Doncic‚Äôs injury, including 51 and 41-point explosions. His **Over 29.5 points (-114)** is a no-brainer.
* **Spread**: Timberwolves -7.5 (-105) / Lakers +7.5 (-115). The line assumes Minnesota‚Äôs a favorite, but their ATS record is **0-4** this season. They lost by 13 to Denver without Edwards‚Äîproof they can‚Äôt even cover when they *want* to.
* **Total**: 225.5 (Over -108 / Under -112). With Reaves scoring like a caffeinated accountant, the Over might be tempting‚Ä¶ but the Wolves‚Äô defense is so porous, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre playing in a wind tunnel.

---

### 2. Digest the News: A Hall of (Injury) Fame

* **Lakers‚Äô Absences**: LeBron‚Äôs sciatic nerve is apparently on vacation, and Doncic‚Äôs trade is still haunting Edwards, who called it ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù last season. Meanwhile, Gabe Vincent‚Äôs absence is so tragic, it‚Äôs the NBA equivalent of losing your Wi-Fi mid-Netflix binge.
* **Timberwolves‚Äô Absences**: Anthony Edwards is out with a hamstring injury he likely got from *trying to trip someone*. Jaden McDaniels and Julius Randle have stepped up, but can two role players really carry a team? It‚Äôs like asking a toaster to win \*MasterChe

He sat across from me, too far. I wished he were closer, even though I knew I shouldn‚Äôt.

The caf√© side of the bookstore smelled like pastries, coffee, and old books. Why did he sit so far away? Because he‚Äôs a good guy, I told myself. He‚Äôs not going to sit closer than necessary. Which, of course, only made me want him more.

Finally, I looked up and found him already watching me. I broke the silence. ‚ÄúYou went home to see your brother this weekend. How was that?‚Äù

Everything he‚Äôd ever told me about his brother hurt to hear. They were best friends growing up until they learned too much about their parents‚Äô problems. One handled it better than the other. The result? One of them felt very alone.

‚ÄúHe stayed shorter than he said he would,‚Äù Caleb said quietly.

‚ÄúIt was all polite, hellos, how-ya-doings, goodbyes. Nothing real. I wanted to talk to him, but we were never alone, and he left early the next morning.‚Äù He hesitated, then looked back at his laptop.

I could feel it. He wanted to say more, but he stopped. Something hovered on the edge of his tongue. There was always that connection between us, like we wanted to tell each other everything after only a few months of even knowing one another. He brought out the softer, more vulnerable parts of me. Or was it me, finally coming to terms with how I truly felt?

Still guilty after our solo movie last week, I did what I always do: self-sabotaged. Or maybe self-corrected. I have yet to decide. ‚ÄúDid you see Grace? Did she feel like he was trying to rush out?‚Äù

There it was, the forbidden thing neither of us ever mentioned. The one that made me feel like a harlot whenever I thought about him too long, partnered with him on projects, or pictured him in bed. His girlfriend. His high-school sweetheart. The victim in all this.

Caleb looked at me for what felt like forever. I could tell he was studying me. Guilt twisted in my chest that I even felt guilty for bringing her up, for reminding us both that, even if we‚Äôd never touched, what we were doing here was essentially emotional cheating.

‚ÄúWe broke up a few weeks ago,‚Äù he said, his voice flat.

The smile that flashed across my face vanished just as quickly as it appeared.

My mind screamed.

A thousand thoughts collided at once. This is amazing news. How could he not tell me? At the movies that night he wasn‚Äôt cheating? I don‚Äôt have to let that night eat me alive? Why is he staring at me like that? Is he watching my reaction? Does he want to talk about it? Can I make a move now? Should I make a move? I don‚Äôt have to feel guilty anymore, right? Wait, was it my fault?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that,‚Äù was all I managed. Normally I could come up with something witty or charming to say to Caleb. He brought that side out of me. That confident, flirtatious side. But that was all I could think of to say.

He kept staring. Then finally, ‚ÄúI think Anthony wanted to get back to Marissa. He said they had plans but never said what.‚Äù

Still staring. Caleb was still watching me carefully.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said softly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it wasn‚Äôt the visit you hoped for. But I‚Äôm glad you came back early. Who else would I scatter my notes around and pretend to study with?‚Äù

He smiled, that big, goofy grin that had made me do a double-take eight weeks ago. ‚ÄúSpeaking of notes,‚Äù Caleb said, ‚ÄúI need to get back to campus and give Russ his before practice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs do I,‚Äù I replied.

We packed up in silence and walked toward my car.

At the car door, Caleb turned to me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing Friday night?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing planned.‚Äù I grinned, a little too quickly. ‚ÄúWhy? Do you have something in mind?‚Äù

He smiled that same goofy smile again. ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôve been debating which fast-food place has the best chicken nuggets.‚Äù He had planned this. This was what he wanted to say all afternoon. ‚ÄúI say we put it to the test. Let me treat you to the finest nuggets a college budget can buy.‚Äù

My heart melted, a messy mix of happiness and guilt. What had I done? More importantly, how would this end?

I paused. My mind flashed to Mason, then Chance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to debate chicken nuggets with you, Caleb.‚Äù",1,1761766192.0,romance,0,1.0,False

We lived in a relaxed household, but my folks were always strict about one rule: No TV, no games, no renting movies, no cable. I was dubbed the ‚Äúweird Amish kid‚Äù. But I wasn‚Äôt Amish, we were just regular old Baptists (even though we didn‚Äôt go to church often). The idea of not having a TV was so foreign to so many of them, but to be frank, I‚Äôd never really considered what it‚Äôd be like to have a TV. All I had were my books and comics. This alienated most, but I had friends in the neighborhood, mainly my best friend Eric, who happened to go to school with me. He was always good for a laugh, we swapped story ideas, and he‚Äôd tell me about all the shows he watched on TV like they were his own stories. He‚Äôd go into extreme detail about who did what and where. One of my favorite shows he told me about was something called the ‚ÄúX-Files,‚Äù which was all about aliens, monsters, and other stuff like that. It captivated my attention, and Eric talked about it like he was telling a grand epic story by a campfire. Then he‚Äôd talk about how the main actress was hot, and I‚Äôd just sit there and roll my eyes.

Out of the blue one night, I had built up the courage to talk to my parents about spending the night at Eric‚Äôs house. My mother choked on her water, and my father just chewed in silence. When her mother cleared her throat, she said,

‚ÄúAre you sure? You‚Äôre not that old yet, maybe next year?‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, Eric had a sleepover at Tommy Peterson‚Äôs last fall, and he‚Äôs only four months older than me!‚Äù

Father, talking through a mouth of chewed meatloaf, said,

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a matter of how old you are, son; we‚Äôre just worried about some of the things you might be exposed to. Eric might have some of those violent video games, or maybe he‚Äôd make you watch something you‚Äôre not supposed to.‚Äù

Mother gestured to Father,

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly it! I couldn‚Äôt have put it better myself, Ronnie.‚Äù

‚ÄúLove you, honey.‚Äù

They held hands over the table as I sat prodding at my food. I felt a sense of defeat wash over me, and perhaps my folks felt it too. Because suddenly, my mother spoke up in a babyish voice, trying to comfort me,

‚ÄúOh, baby, we didn‚Äôt mean to upset you. We just want what‚Äôs best for you.‚Äù

I spoke in a hushed voice as I took a bite of my food,

‚ÄúEric‚Äôs my best friend.‚Äù

My father, who cleared his throat after sipping on some water,

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not saying you can‚Äôt have friends, you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre worried about you. We want you to grow up good, television is bad for you, and so are these violent games. We allowed you to only recently start reading comics, and that‚Äôs pushing it, buddy. We want you to be free of bad influences-‚Äú

‚ÄúEric is not a bad influence! He‚Äôs the nicest kid at school!‚Äù The words exploded from my mouth before I could catch them.
 
The silence seemed eternal and insufferable. My mother‚Äôs lips thinned out as she demanded,

‚ÄúGo upstairs, young man.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sor-‚Äú

‚ÄúNOW!‚Äù

Father was always the one to deal out stern talkings and other disciplinary stuff like that, but when my mother raised her voice? It was like a verbal slap. It scared me, and I ran up to my room trying to stifle tears. I retreated to my bed, covering the blanket over my head so they wouldn‚Äôt hear me crying. The older I got, the more I felt ashamed of crying. My father always told me to dry my tears over crying over ‚Äòdumb shit‚Äô. So, whenever I cried, I made sure no one could see me. 

About thirty minutes later, I heard footsteps rising up the staircase, so I buried my head in a pillow. Trying to muffle any noises I was making. I heard a conversation between my parents, they were looking from my bedroom door because I saw a sliver of light on my wall. They thought they were whispering quietly, but I could hear every word.

‚ÄúI swear to God if he‚Äôs crying again.‚Äù

‚ÄúRonnie, it‚Äôs okay. I shouldn‚Äôt have spoken like that. I hate it when I get angry at him because he just doesn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶he doesn‚Äôt know how much‚Ä¶.‚Äù

I could hear her sniffling.

‚ÄúHey, hey now, Veronica.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I feel like I‚Äôm doing too much. I think we‚Äôre pushing him away.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs only twelve. He‚Äôs gonna be fine.‚Äù

Then they walked to their bedroom. The rest of the night was silent; I just cried myself to sleep. 

When I awoke, I could smell bacon from downstairs. I descended the stairs and rubbed the crust from my eyes. My father was reading yesterday‚Äôs newspaper, trying to figure out the crossword puzzles on the back. My mother was behind the stove, making sure she wasn‚Äôt burning the bacon. Despite her prowess as a cook, she was prone to making plenty of mistakes. She whipped around and gave a kind smile to me.

‚ÄúGood morning, sweetie.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning, Mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ready for school?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôve got everything.‚Äù

My father spoke up,

‚ÄúPut a brush through that head, why don‚Äôt you? Looking like a shaggy mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe looks okay, I‚Äôve seen older kissers sporting worse, that Mullins boy has a god awful mullet, be glad he ain‚Äôt asked for one of those.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm.‚Äù

He went back to his puzzles. My mother set down a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast for me. She also put a glass of orange juice beside the silverware.

‚ÄúDig in, before the bus comes.‚Äù

I sat down, eating the food a little too fast for my father‚Äôs liking, and he even said,

‚ÄúSlow down, you‚Äôll choke.‚Äù In a low, dull voice.

My mother sat at the table and began sipping at her coffee, which was loaded with sugar and creamer. I ate in silence because I didn‚Äôt want to set them off after last night; it‚Äôd been a while since they‚Äôd lashed out at me like that. 

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù My mother started, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about last night, and your father and I have been talking about it.‚Äù

I raised my head up, looking at her while I ate.

‚ÄúI think that spending the night with Eric would be a fun idea.‚Äù

I about choked on my food at the thought of it. I was thrilled, but I tried to downplay it.

‚ÄúMom, are you sure? I don‚Äôt want to-‚Äú

‚ÄúNonsense.‚Äù She cut me off, ‚ÄúIn all honesty, we‚Äôve been a little too overprotective of you. We've seen how the world is, and we automatically assume that the worst could happen to you. And it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶well, let‚Äôs just say that we‚Äôve been stuck in our heads about the whole thing.‚Äù

My father chimed in, ‚ÄúWhat mother is trying to say is that we‚Äôre sorry. We‚Äôre clingy parents, we know it, but only because we care.‚Äù

I was in awe of what I was hearing, and all I could get out was, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

My mother smiled and then put up a stern finger, ‚ÄúBut no weekdays! If you spend the night, it‚Äôs gotta be on the weekend.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure! Sure! Thank you!‚Äù

Before I could say anything else, I could hear the hiss of the Bus brakes coming to a halt outside my house. I grabbed my backpack and my coat and rushed outside.

At school, I was stoked to tell Eric about the whole thing. My mind was racing about what we could do, and to a middle schooler, possibilities were endless. When it came time for lunch, I tracked down Eric at his table, where he was eating a hot dog that was moistened by a copious amount of chili. I sat down next to him and told him the whole thing. He was just as excited as I was, and he said that he‚Äôd ask his parents about spending the night on Friday. The rest of the day was fuzzy because everything paled in comparison to us planning out what we‚Äôd do at Eric‚Äôs house.

The bus ride home was fun; we were still planning about what we‚Äôd do. We thought about playing games (my parents didn‚Äôt like games), playing Dungeons & Dragons with his older brother and friends (my parents thought it was a satanic influence), and we even thought about going to the arcade downtown. Our minds were racing, but it came to a stop when the bus hissed to a stop in front of my house. My mother was there waving from the sidewalk, despite me being twelve, she still waited for me at the sidewalk like I was five. It got heckled by other kids for it, but I didn‚Äôt really care. What was I supposed to do? Tell my mom and dad?

Later that night, my mother got a phone call from Eric‚Äôs mom about the sleepover. I was positively beaming about the whole thing. It didn‚Äôt become real until that phone call; it was happening, actually happening. I looked over my things to try and decide what I could possibly bring to Eric‚Äôs house. I grabbed some of my Batman comics, a few toys I had, and I even packed my favorite book for him to borrow, *The Island of Doctor Moreau*. 

A knock at the door caught my attention, and I snapped around to see my father at the door, smiling down at me. 

‚ÄúYou excited?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know the rules. Make sure you‚Äôre nice, and be thankful for anything they give you. Y‚Äôknow, I remember my first sleepover, it was with some kid named Randy, who loved to show me his ant colony behind glass.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeird.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, not as weird as you think. Seeing them all there behind the glass working about like they were actually at home underground, it‚Äôs fascinating.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶could I-‚Äú

‚ÄúGet an ant colony? Absolutely not, it fell over in the middle of the night, and we woke up with bites all over our bodies.‚Äù

He chuckled and turned away, but he paused briefly and added,

""Hey, be sure to pack your toothbrush.""

""I won't.""

""Love you, buddy.""

There are moments in your life that you look back and feel the warmth of the interaction. Love, familial love, it truly nurtures the soul. If I only knew.

When it came time, we left around six in the afternoon, my Mother drove me down the neighborhood until we came across a house that had several uncarved pumpkins and the dull glow of orange lights strung upon the gutter. 

""Festive!"" she said, ""We really ought to grab some pumpkins this week, eh?""

""Yeah, can we get big ones?""

""Of course.""

The light from the front porch turned on, and Eric stepped out, waving at me. His face was silhouetted from the light behind him, but I could tell he was excited just from his body language. I kept waiting for something to change, maybe I'd be shaken awake from a dream, or my Mother would've changed her mind and driven off. But I walked from the car and into the cold October night. I turned around and waved. She waved back, and then she drove away.

""Billy!"" Eric called, ""You made it!""

""Can you believe it?!""

""Right? Your folks are usually so strict. What made them lighten up?""

""I think they felt bad for me.""

""Man, maybe I need to guilt-trip my folks too.""

""Oh shut up, Eric.""

""Shut up, yourself, dickwad. Hey, my Mom made cut-out cookies for us inside, the ones with the little pumpkins on them.""

We headed inside, and it was warm, but his Mom lit an obnoxiously powerful pumpkin candle. So it smelled like freshly baked cookies and a potent pumpkin perfumey smell. When I walked into the living room, I saw the brilliant glow of the TV illuminating the floor of the room. It was FOX, and the commercial was advertising a brand new episode of The X-Files.

""Hey, are we gonna watch that tonight?""

""Watch what?""

""The new episode of The X-Files?""

Eric's eyes widened, and he looked to his mom for approval. She was fixing herself a cup of coffee, and with tired eyes, she said flatly,

""Listen, Billy's mom said no, but you're a guest in my house. As far as I'm concerned, I'm fine with it. But no complaining if you get nightmares, okay?""

""Yes!"" Eric shouted, and he pumped his fist like he won the Super Bowl or something. He was a goofy asshole, but man, he was a great friend. 

We killed time until the new episode by doing all sorts of stuff. I showed him my comics from home while he showed me his. I liked Batman; he preferred Superman, but we loved the stories from each. He showed me his SNES and a game called 'Sunset Riders'. I had never played a game before, but the whole thing was mesmerizing. The bright colors, the rapid pace of the music, the characters, it was just like nothing I'd ever seen before. And for a kid who'd never played games before, I was pretty terrible, but according to Eric, I was better than his brother Thomas. 

When Thomas got home with his friends, Eric asked him to play a quick campaign with us on D&D. He was hesitant, considering he only ever played with his pals, but he reconsidered it because he wanted to test-run a new campaign he'd be trying to create. And for someone who was terrible at video games, I took to this much better, mainly because D&D was purely about imagination and the chance of dice. I made a character, he was a skeleton mage, and Eric was Ragnar the Viking King...He died in the first battle we had and sat pissy the rest of the time. It was a great time, though, and as for the Campaign, it was essentially a simpler version of Lord of the Rings. Dark lord, object of power, you get the idea.

Then it came time for the episode of the X-Files, the episode was entitled 'HOME', and when the TV-MA logo popped up in the top right corner of the frame, I heard Thomas speak from the recliner, 

""Huh, that's new.""

""What?"" I said,

""Usually says TV-14.""

""And what does that mean?""

Eric chimed in, ""That means we're in for some serious shit.""

And indeed it was. For someone who never consumed any form of media, whether it be Television or Film, this was a horrific trial by fire. It was a gruesome, horrifying time. I was rendered motionless by the time the credits rolled. Eric was also stuck with an expression of shock on his face, and the same went for Thomas, whose deadpan expression was replaced by one of horror. 

Eric's mom walked in and said,

""Alright, you can stay up for a little bit more, but don't stay up too late, okay?""

I thought to myself, 'I'm not gonna sleep for a fucking week'. Eric's mom walked in and took the remote from him to put on the news. She sat back on the couch, and we didn't move since the episode; we were frozen in terror. Thomas got up and went to his room. And for a second, Eric and I were planning on going back to his room. His mom laid out a blow-up bed on the floor. But before we could do anything, a loud news report blared from the TV.

""And now, we've got an update on the missing child case of 'Anthony Rubens', who was last seen in the West Field Mall in Wallens, Kentucky, in 1989 at only five years old. But now, with the help of the latest technology, we've got a picture of what Rubens would look like now. A professional was called in to age up Rubens to the appropriate age that he is now. We're going to show both pictures. Here is what he looks like we he was last seen at age five...and this is what he would look like now.""

That's when an existential fear washed over my body like iced water. Because the face I saw on the television was my own.

""Huh, he looks just like..."" And Eric's mother stopped, 

Eric looked at me and then back at the TV in disbelief. The news anchor resumed,

""If you have any information, please contact the Wallens Police Department. In other news...""

We all sat there in the living room, dumbfounded. They all stared at me like I was some sort of strange otherworldly being, like I wasn't...me. But who was I really? Did I even know? When everyone went to sleep, I sat awake in the sleeping bag, staring at the dark, questioning every aspect of myself. I eventually blacked out and awoke from no dreams. I sat in the living room, staring out of the window, waiting for my mom to pick me up. No one said anything; they just ate breakfast in silence and looked at me with worried glances.

The car pulled up to the house, and I left, waving back at Eric and his family. I hopped in the back seat, and my mother looked back at me with a wide smile, asking,

""Well? How'd you like your first sleepover?""",2,1761766075.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Portland Trail Blazers vs. Utah Jazz: A Clash of Clowns and Clutch**  
The Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz are set for a 2025-26 NBA showdown in Salt Lake City, where the Blazers (-3.5) are favored despite both teams‚Äô checkered pasts. Let‚Äôs dissect this matchup with the precision of a spreadsheet and the wit of a late-night monologue.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Toasters

The Blazers enter as favorites with a 59.26% implied probability (based on 1.68 decimal odds), while the Jazz hover at 44.44% (2.24 odds). On paper, Portland‚Äôs edge stems from their 2-2 ATS record against .500+ teams, including a recent 122-108 road win over the Lakers. Utah, meanwhile, has only faced 1-3 teams this season, making their 3-1 record less impressive than a toaster in a bakery.

The spread (-3.5) reflects Portland‚Äôs perceived superiority, but don‚Äôt let Utah‚Äôs 2-1 record fool you. They‚Äôve thrived against soft competition, while the Blazers have clawed through tougher opponents. It‚Äôs like comparing a circus juggler (Portland) to a street performer (Utah)‚Äîboth entertaining, but only one gets paid in tips.

---

### Player News: Injuries, Prop Bets, and a Circus Act

Portland‚Äôs Deni Avdija is the star of this show, averaging 23.5 PPG on 44.4% from deep. With Anfernee Simmons and Deandre Ayton gone, Avdija‚Äôs 16.8 FGA per game makes him a must-watch prop bet. He‚Äôs the NBA‚Äôs version of a Swiss Army knife‚Äîsharp, versatile, and occasionally used to open stubborn pickle jars.

On the Jazz side, Lauri Markkanen is a human wrecking ball, dropping 34.7 PPG this season. His 51-point explosion against Phoenix was so dominant, it made Shaedon Sharpe‚Äôs 37-point game look like a homework assignment. Markkanen‚Äôs 22.5-point over/under is a no-brainer, unless he decides to take a coffee break mid-game.

Injuries? Portland‚Äôs losses are already in the rearview mirror (Simmons and Ayton are ghosts of NBA past), while Utah‚Äôs Kyle Fil

i am scared i damaged the nerves in my mouth and esophagus yesterday and did not feel the temperature, and it was actually burning hot. i am scared i burned my esophagus now, and even my stomach. is this possible? how bad is this?

I always tip at least 20% at sit down restaurants where I receive table service. I don't always tip when I order at the counter though like coffee shops and boba shops. Sometimes I do and when I do it'll be the lowest amount or $1. 

My friend usually orders after me and I've noticed she watches me when I'm paying. One time after we ordered, she tells me how her mom is so cheap and always chooses the lowest amount (after she saw I chose the lowest amount). I think this is weird because her mom makes significantly more money than me so I don't think it's fair to compare us. 

Or the other day we went to a restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring your order to your table but that's it. They don't provide any service after that like you have to go get and refill your own drink. So I custom tipped them $2 when I was ordering and I hear my friend go ""oh!"" I think she did that because I didn't choose the 20% button that automatically pops up. 

It just makes me feel weird she watches me and judges me. I'm starting to feel insecure like maybe I'm not tipping enough? But I feel like what I have been tipping is fair so please let me know if I am wrong. But I still don't like how she's watching me and judging me for it.

Is her behavior normal and I'm just wrong?

1ojdtds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ojdtds/im_thinking_about_moving_out_but_im_unsure_advice/,"I‚Äôm thinking about moving out, but I‚Äôm unsure. Advice?","So I have a lottttt of things on my mind. I currently live with my parents, along with my twin brother (we are 19). My parents are both pretty emotionally immature, but my mom especially. There is a lot of background instances of them treating me and my brother with disrespect, being manipulative, being toxic, and overall controlling. It‚Äôs been really hard personally for me to deal with this, because I have a lot of things on my plate. I go to college online, I‚Äôm in an apprenticeship (working Tuesday-Thursday), I have ADHD and depression I‚Äôm trying to figure out, and I‚Äôm in a committed relationship. 

But here‚Äôs the catch: I am not financially ready to move out. Thankfully my job covers my college expenses, but I only work 22.5 hours a week, with a rate of $18/hour. I also have a car that I‚Äôm still paying off, along of course with insurance. I‚Äôm also paying off about $1,400 in credit card debt from repairs to my car. I‚Äôm also saving about $250 a month to move out. But all of that combined, is not enough for an apartment (monthly rent around me is $1,000). My parents do charge me rent, only a small $200 as well.

Like I said before, I‚Äôm in an apprenticeship. I have 9 months left of the program, where I will be offered a full time position with a salary of about $50,000. So I have to wait financially until that time. 


I even calculated the cost with my brother, and it‚Äôs still not possible (he works minimum wage at a little coffee shop.)


So, I went to my boyfriend‚Äôs parents. They are very loving, supportive, and extremely caring. He has moms, and they were both more than ok with me moving in at any time. They know all of things my parents say to me, and how they treat me (they of course treat me so much better).

So I‚Äôm left in a weird situation, if I want to move out, my boyfriend‚Äôs parents are the only space for me to go. We‚Äôve been together for almost 3 years now, and it‚Äôs a very healthy relationship. We have agreed to move in together someday and get married. My boyfriend also can‚Äôt afford to move out, so having an apartment with him isn‚Äôt an option either.

But there is a lot of consequences with just moving out to my boyfriend‚Äôs house.

First: my parents are notttt going to be happy. They don‚Äôt want me and boyfriend to move in together when we move out, instead they want us to move out separately to get a feel for independence. 

Second: There are going to be a lot of questions. Why would you do this? You didn‚Äôt seem upset with us? Blah blah blah. I feel a lot of guilt for this. I mean, they are still my parents, and I still have some love for them because of that. 

When they aren‚Äôt toxic and manipulative, they can be good parents. Sometimes they are nice, do things for me, but me things. But when they are toxic and manipulative, they comment on my body, refuse to my accommodating, are blatantly mean, take their stress and anger out on me, and much more. The cycle of nice parents and mean parents drain me and give me false hope. It put me in therapy since the age of 16. I am constantly second guessing myself and losing confidence at work, at school, and in my relationship. 

Third: My car is in my dad‚Äôs name. It is not co-signed, just fully his car. I pay insurance and the monthly payment to them. I could them telling me that it‚Äôs their car, and that I can‚Äôt take it with me, but then I have no car. Thankfully, I can work from home, but besides that, I have no mode of personal transportation. My brother‚Äôs car is the family van, also theirs. 

Fourth: Telling them I‚Äôm moving out might cut off ties with them and other family members. My grandparents are very traditional, and I don‚Äôt see them agreeing with my decision by any means. So I would potentially be losing my parents, grandparents, and other relatives. Plus, what about holidays? I assume I won‚Äôt be invited.

Fifth: I‚Äôm incredibly unsure. Right now, I‚Äôve just been telling myself, just wait until you are full time. But it‚Äôs becoming increasingly harder and difficult to deal with my parent‚Äôs behavior. They won‚Äôt take criticism, or just me telling them my feelings. I‚Äôve been threatened to be kicked out several times since I turned 18 as well. Unfortunately, my therapist and I agree that nothing will get better until I move out. Potentially including my mental health. I‚Äôve honestly lost hope of having a good relationship with my parents, but it still hurts.

One of our members recently reached out to me, saying they'd been thinking a lot about the parents of the shooters and that inspired them to write this story. They shared it with me privately, and it genuinely moved me. It's beautifully written, and offers such a rare, human perspective that often gets lost when talking about Columbine.

They've kindly allowed me to post it here so others can read it too.

----

Synopsis: ‚ÄòFor readers interested in Columbine and similar real-world tragedies. This short story is told from perspective of a father whose son committed a school shooting. Inspired by Columbine, from the perspective of Wayne Harris and Tom Klebold.‚Äô

 
His Father

It‚Äôs been six days since the shooting.

I never thought silence could have such a weight to it. Yet after what happened -after the sirens and the shouting and the endless burst of camera shutters- the silence of this house sits on me like cold sodden sand. 

You can hear the smallest things.
The creak of the floorboards.
The hum of the fridge.
The old radiators knocking like restless bones.
The sound of your own breath turning over in your chest like something alive and ashamed to be.

It‚Äôs been six days since the shooting.

Six days since the world cracked open. I used to measure time in easy things - the first coffee of the morning, the whistle of the shift change, the way the light slid across the kitchen by late afternoon. Now I measure it in news cycles and police updates, in how long I can go without someone pounding on the door demanding to know what kind of Father raises a murderer.

I haven‚Äôt gone outside except to bring in the mail, and even that feels dangerous, like stepping into enemy territory. People have started leaving things at the edge of the yard, little signs written in black marker, flowers that aren‚Äôt really flowers but dead stems and wilted apologies. One morning I found a bullet casing in the driveway. I don‚Äôt know if someone left it or if it‚Äôs been there all along and I just never noticed. You start to notice everything after something like this.

The hospital called again this morning. They tell me there‚Äôs no change. They say it in that careful voice, the one that tries not to make promises. No change. It‚Äôs become a kind of mantra for me, a line I repeat when everything gets too much: No change. Because as long as there‚Äôs no change, he‚Äôs still alive. My boy is still somewhere in there, under the wires and the machines.

No change.

Everything has changed. 

His name is Evan. Seventeen. He shot six people. He‚Äôs the reason the town will never look at me the same again. Sometimes, I can‚Äôt even say his name out loud because it feels like I‚Äôm saying a curse.

The thing is when I think of him, I still don‚Äôt see a killer. I see a child who used to build model airplanes at the dining table, who‚Äôd get glue on his fingers, laugh and try to peel it off like a second skin. I see him in his baseball uniform, his cap too big, his smile too small. I see him when he was seven and asked me what happens to bad dreams when you wake up. I told him they disappear, but I‚Äôm starting to think I lied.

They won‚Äôt let me see him alone at the hospital. There‚Äôs always a cop in the corner of the room, sitting with that blank expression they must practice in training. The nurse told me she thought it was unnecessary, that he‚Äôs not going anywhere, but the rules are the rules. I don‚Äôt know who the officer is supposed to be protecting - my son, or everyone else from him.

I sat by his bed for an hour. The machines beeped like a metronome, steady, calm. His face looked‚Ä¶ younger, somehow. I could almost pretend he was sleeping off a fever or a football injury. But then my eyes fell on the bruising around his temple, the small patch where they shaved his head to get to the swelling underneath, and I remembered. The officer outside the school told me the bullet went through the side of his skull. They said it was self-inflicted. They said he must have realised the gravity of what he‚Äôd done. I don‚Äôt know if that makes it better or worse.

There‚Äôs something obscene about how quickly people decide what the truth is. The TV people talk about ‚Äòmotive‚Äô like it‚Äôs a word that can make sense of everything. I‚Äôve seen his yearbook photo on the evening news more times than I‚Äôve looked at it myself. They replay the same three clips - his football practice, a science fair, a neighbour saying he was ‚Äòquiet, polite.‚Äô Every segment ends with the anchor lowering her voice to say, ‚ÄòWe may never understand what drove him to do this.‚Äô Then they cut to an insurance commercial.

I can‚Äôt watch anymore. But I still do. I tell myself it‚Äôs because I need to know what they‚Äôre saying, what the police are releasing. But that‚Äôs not the truth. The truth is, I watch because I‚Äôm waiting for someone to say it was all a mistake. That it wasn‚Äôt him. That the camera angle was all wrong. That there‚Äôs another boy with the same face. A simple case of mistaken identity. I keep hoping the story will rewrite itself.

But it never does.

The last time I stepped outside was when Pastor Morris stopped by. He didn‚Äôt come inside. He just stood on the porch, holding a casserole like some relic of normal life. He looked older than I remembered. The wind was tugging at his coat, and I thought of how many funerals he must have been planning this week. He asked if he could pray with me, and I said yes, because I didn‚Äôt know what else to say. He started talking about forgiveness and grace, and I wanted to believe him. But grace feels like something that belongs to other people now, people who didn‚Äôt raise monsters.

When he finished, he put a hand on my shoulder and said, ‚ÄòGod still sees your son, Hank.‚Äô I almost laughed. God sees him. Sure. Everyone sees him now. The news, the parents, the town, they all see him. But they don‚Äôt see my son. They see what he did.

When the pastor left, I threw the casserole in the trash. It was cold by then.

The police came the next day. Two of them. They didn‚Äôt sit; they just stood by the door, looking around like they were cataloguing everything. They asked the same questions they‚Äôve asked before - about guns, about the last time I saw him, about whether he‚Äôd seemed angry or off. I told them the truth: I didn‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt see it coming. They wrote something in their notebooks like that was a confession.

When they left, one of them turned back and said, ‚ÄòYou know, Mr. Campbell, people are looking for answers.‚Äô I wanted to say, so am I.

At night, I dream of him standing at the top of the stairs, the way he used to when he was little, when he‚Äôd call out, ‚ÄòDad?‚Äô just to make sure I was still awake. In the dream, he doesn‚Äôt say anything, though. He just stands there, his face shadowed, and I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs the boy I remember or the stranger I saw on the news. 

When I wake up, I lie still and listen to the house breathe. It‚Äôs an old place. Sometimes, I think I hear footsteps in the hallway, or the faint creak of his bedroom door. It‚Äôs nothing, always nothing of course. But there‚Äôs a part of me that still half expects him to walk in, to tell me it‚Äôs all been some horrible mistake.

I haven‚Äôt been inside his room since that night. The police took what they wanted. His computer, his journals, his books, some things from his closet. But they left the rest. His sheets are still tangled on the bed, his clothes on the floor, a half-finished model airplane by the window. When I pass his room, there‚Äôs a smell in there that used to be him. Sweat and detergent and something sharp like pencil shavings. It‚Äôs fading now, and I don‚Äôt know why that makes me so afraid. Maybe because once it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs like he never lived here at all.

I keep thinking about the parents of the other kids. About what they must feel when they see my face on the TV. Hatred, probably. Rage for sure. And they‚Äôd be right. If someone had done to my child what he did to theirs, I‚Äôd want blood too. There‚Äôs no way to make sense of it. No way to fix it. I‚Äôve tried to write letters‚Ä¶ I sit down and start, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äô and then I stop, because what kind of sorry could ever be enough? How do you apologise for something that should never have been possible?

Yesterday, a parent came to the house. I didn‚Äôt know who she was until she said her name, her daughter was one of the ones in the hospital, the girl who might never walk again. Her hands were shaking when she spoke. She asked me why. Just that one word: why? I couldn‚Äôt answer her. I wanted to. I wanted to give her something; even a lie. But there‚Äôs nothing I can say that won‚Äôt sound like an insult. So, I just stood there, holding the door, and she started crying. Not loud, just this small, breaking sound. Before she left, she said, ‚ÄòHe ruined her life.‚Äô Then she looked at me and added, ‚ÄòAnd he ruined yours too.‚Äô

She‚Äôs right.

Tomorrow, there‚Äôs a town meeting. They‚Äôre calling it a ‚Äòcommunity conversation‚Äô but I know what it really is. People want someone to blame, and I‚Äôm the only one left who can answer. I‚Äôve thought about not going, about hiding here until it all burns out, but that feels cowardly.

Still, I don‚Äôt know what I could possibly say to them. That I didn‚Äôt know my own son? That I missed the signs? That somewhere along the way, something in him slipped beyond my reach? That I loved him anyway? Sometimes I wonder if loving him is the worst thing I could admit to. 

When I went to the hospital today, I brought the photo album his mother made before she got ill. The nurse smiled when she saw me, the kind of polite smile people use when they‚Äôre afraid of saying the wrong thing. 

She eventually told me I could talk to him, that hearing voices can sometimes help. I sat down beside him, opened the album, and started talking. Told him about the times we went fishing, about how he used to hate the bait worms but loved holding the rod. I showed him the picture of his sixth birthday, the one with the red velvet cake his mother made, and his missing front tooth. I even laughed a little. Then I stopped, because the sound of my laughter, however faint, felt like a betrayal.

After an hour, I just sat there, listening to the machines. The officer by the door shifted, coughed. I looked at my son -at the bandages, the tubes, the slackness in his mouth, the patch of shaven hair above his temple- and for the first time, I let myself really wonder if maybe he knew what he was doing when he pulled that trigger on himself. Maybe he wanted this. Maybe he didn‚Äôt want to live with what he‚Äôd done. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse: the thought that he did it out of guilt, or that he didn‚Äôt.

When I left, the sun was setting behind the hospital parking lot, turning the car windows a light crimson. I stood there for a long time, watching my reflection in the glass, and I thought, this is the rest of my life now. Walking through a world that only knows me as the father of the boy who killed. A father of a child so dark, he was capable of a massacre. 

The night before the meeting, I sat at the kitchen table with the lights off. The clock ticking down like a hammer. Each tock like the thud of a judge‚Äôs gavel. 

Again, I could see my reflection in the window. A ghost of myself. I tried to remember what I used to look like before this week. Before I was him: His Father. The one people will whisper about in the grocery store, the one they will cross the street to avoid.

There‚Äôs a photo of Evan on the fridge, his senior portrait, the one the school mailed to us in April. He‚Äôs wearing a black jacket, a white shirt, and that crooked smile that never quite fit his face. I caught myself staring at it for a long time. The fridge buzzing softly beneath it, like it was alive. I wanted to tear the photo down. Instead, I straightened it.

Morning came. The clock continued to tick down. I shaved, put on my best shirt, and drove into town. The roads were emptier than usual, though I could feel eyes from porches and shop windows. At the stoplight, a woman in the next car looked over, then looked away fast, like she‚Äôd touched something hot.

The meeting was in the high school gymnasium. That place used to smell like varnish and sweat; now it smelled like disinfectant. The basketball hoops had been raised, and rows of folding chairs filled the floor. A banner still hung over the stage from a cancelled pep rally: ‚ÄòGO EAGLES! KILL THE COMPETITION!‚Äô I wanted to laugh at the cruel irony of it, but I didn‚Äôt.

The Police Chief stood near the front, along with the Mayor and Pastor Morris. There were reporters too, huddled together but jostling separately for the big scoop that may or may not ever come. When I walked in, the sound in the room dropped a few octaves. Conversations died mid-sentence. I felt the weight of a hundred eyes settle on me. The chief gave a small nod, but it wasn‚Äôt kindness. Just acknowledgment.

I took a seat in the back, by the exit. I thought if I sat quietly enough, maybe they‚Äôd forget I was there.

The mayor started with a speech about ‚Äòhealing‚Äô and ‚Äòresilience‚Äô, the kind of words that sound important but don‚Äôt mean much when you‚Äôre burying children. Then the microphone was passed around. Parents, teachers, students. They spoke about loss, about fear, about how the town would never, ever be the same again. One mother asked why the warning signs were ignored. A teacher said there should‚Äôve been more security. Someone shouted, ‚ÄòWhere was his father?!‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt turn around, but I felt the words hit me, heavy like lead. Another voice followed, trembling with anger. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs sitting right there!‚Äô 

And just like that, people turned in their seats, the noise swelling like a storm. The mayor tried to calm them, but it was too late -questions came like pelted stones: Did you know? Why did you have guns in the house? What kind of parent doesn‚Äôt see what his kid‚Äôs planning? What do you have to say for yourself?

I stood up. My hands were shaking so badly I had to grip the back of the chair in front of me. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt know,‚Äô I said, my voice barely carrying. ‚ÄòIf I had, I would‚Äôve‚Ä¶‚Äô But I couldn‚Äôt finish the sentence, because what would I have done? Locked him up? Called the police on my own son? People were shaking their heads. Someone in the front row muttered, ‚ÄòToo late for that now.‚Äô

I wanted to shout out that I was sorry. That I‚Äôm living the same nightmare as they are, only from a different side. But looking at them, at their faces carved with grief, I knew there was no place for my sorrow among theirs. Their pain had a purity to it. Mine was tainted.

The Police Chief stepped forward, said something about ‚Äòletting the investigation continue,‚Äô and the meeting dissolved into low murmurs. I slipped out before anyone could stop me. The cold bitter air giving me the reprieve to feel something else, anything, even for a split second. I stood there on the steps of the school, the same steps my son had once climbed every morning, and thought: I will never belong here again.

That night, I dreamed again. Evan was sitting at the kitchen table, his head bowed over one of his model planes. The light was soft, golden, almost holy. He looked up and said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs stuck, Dad...‚Äô I leaned closer. There was a crack in his airplane where the glue should‚Äôve been. Blood, not glue was seeping out. I look to my son and see he‚Äôs not trying to peel the glue from his hands anymore, but dry, congealed blood. Despite my horror, he smiles away, as if he doesn‚Äôt register any of it. When I woke, my pillow was damp. I didn‚Äôt know if it was sweat or tears.

I drove to the lake to escape the nightmares. It‚Äôs the same lake where I used to take Evan fishing when he was small. Back then, he‚Äôd talk the whole time -about frogs, clouds, anything, just anything- while I pretended to listen and watched the water. The lake hasn‚Äôt changed. The surface still shining like polished metal. But the stillness feels wrong now, as if even the water itself knows. 

I parked by the edge and sat in the truck until the engine ticked itself quiet. The cold seeped through the windows. There were sirens somewhere far off- faint, like echoes. And I thought about how life keeps going, even after it should stop. The absurdity of that.

I tried to pray then, though I‚Äôm not sure to whom. I said, if he wakes up, let him be someone else. Let him be clean again. But even as I said it, I knew that was impossible. You can‚Äôt scrub out what‚Äôs been done. You can‚Äôt unmake the truth.

The hospital called just after dawn. ‚ÄòNo change‚Äô the nurse said, but her tone was different this time - careful, like she was bracing for something. She mentioned the doctors were concerned about Evan‚Äôs ‚Äòneurological response.‚Äô I thanked her and hung up before she could explain further. I already knew what she meant. Still, I went. I always go.

The sky was bruised purple when I pulled into the parking lot. The officer was there again, same spot by the door. He nodded again at my arrival. Inside, the room smelled like bleach and the cooked sandwich the officer ate for his breakfast. My son lay there, just like always, his chest rising and falling under the blanket. A nurse adjusted a tube, checked a monitor, and slipped out.

I sat on the chair. It groaned. For a long time, I just watched his hand, still, pale, nails trimmed too short. I wanted to hold it, but I didn‚Äôt. It felt like touching him might break something fragile between us, something that isn‚Äôt forgiveness but isn‚Äôt hate either.

Then, quietly, I started talking. Not about the past this time, but about the present, about the town meeting, the lake, my lack of sleep, the way the house feels too big now he‚Äôs gone. I told him I didn‚Äôt know how to keep living like this, walking around with his face in mine. I said I didn‚Äôt hate him, not really, but I hated what he‚Äôd done to both of us. The machines clicked, steady as ever.

A doctor came in after a while, young, tired-looking. She asked if she could speak with me outside. Her name tag: Dr. Yunn. We stepped into the hallway, where the light was harsher.

‚ÄòWe‚Äôve done another scan‚Äô, she said, flipping through a notepad. ‚ÄòThe swelling hasn‚Äôt gone down.‚Äô ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs minimal brain activity at this point.‚Äô She paused, looking at me with that same professional sympathy I‚Äôve seen too much of lately. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll continue monitoring, of course, but‚Ä¶ you should be prepared for the possibility that he may not regain consciousness. And if he does, he may not‚Ä¶‚Äô She hesitated. ‚Äò‚Ä¶ever be the same.‚Äô

Her words hung there, sterile, sharp. I nodded, because that‚Äôs what people do when they don‚Äôt understand. When they can‚Äôt comprehend the gravity of it all. She touched my arm briefly, and left me standing there under the fluorescent hum.

I try to picture him there, trapped in that body, in that silence, while the world outside spits his name like poison. What kind of life is that? A murderer who can‚Äôt move, can‚Äôt speak, can‚Äôt even understand what he‚Äôs done? Would he see their faces when he closed his eyes, or nothing at all? Would he know who he is, or has he been spared that, too? Would he still dream his bad dreams?

Sometimes I almost hope he doesn‚Äôt wake up, because I don‚Äôt know what kind of mercy it would be to bring him back into a world that will never forgive him. Yet the thought of him lying there, empty and forgotten, terrifies me just as much. Either way, he‚Äôs lost, and I‚Äôm the one left to keep watch over what remains.

I walked back into the room and sat down again. Evan hadn‚Äôt moved. The beeping continued, relentless and precise. It struck me then - maybe this is what‚Äôs left of him. Not the boy who laughed at my fishing jokes, or the teenager who slammed doors. Just this sound, this beeping, steady and mechanical, like time refusing to stop.

I reached for his hand. It was cold, limp. I held it anyway. For a long time. Long enough for my arm to ache. In that stillness, I realised something I hadn‚Äôt allowed myself to before - my son might live, but he‚Äôs already gone. Whatever light was in him, good or bad, it‚Äôs somewhere I can‚Äôt reach. Maybe it burned out the moment he raised that gun. Maybe it‚Äôs been fading for years and I was too blind to see it. 

I drove home at dusk. The streets were empty again. When I pulled into the driveway, I noticed someone had painted a word on my fence in red: MONSTER. The paint was still wet. I didn‚Äôt clean it. I just stood there, reading it over and over, thinking how wrong it was. They didn‚Äôt mean him. They meant me. MONSTER. 

Inside, I sat at the kitchen table again. The house hummed, the clock ticked, the same old sounds, but they felt further away now, like the world was slowly pulling back. I thought about the doctor‚Äôs words. May not be the same. What if that‚Äôs mercy? What if losing himself is the only kindness left?

I went upstairs to his room. The air was stale, thick with dust. The half-finished airplane was still by the window, wings crooked. I picked it up. The glue hardened into cloudy ridges. When I held it to the light, it caught on a thin strand of spiderweb. I don‚Äôt know why, but that‚Äôs what broke me. I sat on his bed, holding that stupid model plane, and cried until my chest hurt. Until I was sure I had no more tears left. 

When it was over, I whispered, ‚ÄòYou can stop now, Evan. You can rest.‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt mean die, not exactly. I just meant stop hurting. Stop carrying this weight, wherever you are.

The wind picked up outside, rattling the window. Somewhere down the street, a dog barked. Life going on. Always going on.
I set the model back on the windowsill, careful not to break it. Then I turned off the light and stood in the doorway, looking at the shape of the room. The desk, the posters, the bed, the model airplanes, all frozen in time. And for the first time since the shooting, I felt something close to acceptance. Not peace, not forgiveness, just a small, cold understanding that this is what‚Äôs left.

My son may never wake up. May never wake up again. And even if he does, the boy I loved, the one who laughed, who built airplanes, who once asked me where bad dreams go‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs already gone.

Outside, the night pressed in. The silence felt heavier than ever. But it was an honest silence, the kind that doesn‚Äôt lie about what it is. I sat by the window until dawn crept in, thin and colourless, painting everything a strange coloured ash. And when the light finally reached his photo on the fridge, I didn‚Äôt look away. I just whispered, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm still here.‚Äô Though I‚Äôm not sure who I was saying it for, him, or me. 

I feel my eyes beginning to close. I‚Äôm tired. I want to feel everything all at once to get it out of the way, but I mostly want to feel nothing.

If black were truly black not grey‚Ä¶

The shrill ring of the phone cuts through the dark, dragging me from an uneasy sleep. 

Dr Yunn.

‚ÄòMr Campbell, come quickly! There‚Äôs activity. He‚Äôs waking up. Evan‚Äôs waking up.‚Äô

I don't know about you guys, but this story really made me think again about what the Klebolds and Harrises must have felt, and still feel. It's so easy to forget that to them, Eric and Dylan were their babies. 

We tend to focus so much on the last year or two of their lives, but they had seventeen and eighteen whole years before that - birthdays, school plays, family trips, inside jokes, the ordinary everyday moments that make up a childhood. We've all seen the photos and heard stories about Dylan as a sweet, ssnsitive, shy kid. But the same was true for Eric too. He was once a little boy, loved and protected and seen as good.

For their parents, that's who they still see. No matter what happened later, that's still their child. And I think people often forget the weight of that. I can't even begin to imagine the pain they must carry... the grief, the guilt, the love that never really goes away. It's a kind of heartbreak that has no place to rest.",9,1761765137.0,ColumbineTalk,2,1.0,False

Everything felt like rubble ‚Äî friendships, purpose, even my own identity.   
Counseling didn‚Äôt just pull me out of the wreckage; it handed me a blueprint.   

That‚Äôs why I created **_The 5-Step Counseling Framework That Helped Me Rebuild My Life_** ‚Äî because healing shouldn‚Äôt feel like decoding an ancient text.  
Here‚Äôs what I learned and how it might help you too. üëá  

---

### üîë Step 1: Radical Self-Awareness  
I used to run from my feelings like they were debt collectors.  
Counseling forced me to face them ‚Äî not with judgment, but with curiosity.  

* Tip: Spend 10 quiet minutes journaling daily.  
* Don‚Äôt edit. Don‚Äôt perform. Just notice.  

Awareness is the first demolition before rebuilding can even begin.

---

### üí¨ Step 2: The Art of Emotional Honesty  
My therapist once said, ‚ÄúEmotional repression is like ignoring the smoke alarm while your kitchen burns.‚Äù  
Turns out, she was right.  

* Try saying what you actually feel out loud, even if to your mirror.  
* Truth liberates ‚Äî it might sting, but it saves.  

---

### üß© Step 3: Boundaries as Self-Respect  
Boundaries aren‚Äôt walls; they‚Äôre fences with unlocked gates.  
You decide who enters, on what terms, and for how long.  

* Learn to say ‚Äúno‚Äù without writing a five-paragraph apology.  
* Protect your time like it‚Äôs sacred currency ‚Äî because it is.  

---

### üåø Step 4: Small Wins Over Big Transformations  
Healing isn‚Äôt a fireworks show; it‚Äôs more like watching grass grow.  
You rarely notice progress until one day, it‚Äôs a whole field.  

* Celebrate brushing your teeth on dark days.  
* Reward consistency, not perfection.  

---

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Step 5: Service as Healing  
When I started supporting others, I found my own pain lifting.  
There‚Äôs something powerful about turning scars into signposts for someone else.  

* Help one person feel less alone.  
* That ripple never stops spreading.  

---

That‚Äôs the 5‚Äëstep framework that rewired how I see healing ‚Äî slow, honest, and deeply human.

Foods very high in salicylates are: herbs/spices (curry powder, thyme, basil, oregano...), tea, coffee, wine, peppers, spinach, dried fruits, many berries and others...  
If you never tried a low salicylate diet, ask ChatGPT or Claude or any AI to build you such a diet and give it a try.

**TL;DR**

Hey peeps, so I built **Mopp** to fix a painful problem: hiring for cleaning companies. Y'all are not hiring for cleaning companies so this is to walk through the process of laying this out and getting first few customers. 

**PROBLEM**

No matter how great your cleaning business is ‚Äî if you can‚Äôt find and keep reliable cleaners, it stalls.

So we built a platform that gives every cleaning company a **ready-to-go hiring page**, complete with branded forms, applicant tracking, and automation.

Launched real chill on Facebook.  
  
Hit $1,200 MRR. I know it‚Äôs not much but that‚Äôs in the first few days, so feeling pretty good.

Anyhow this is how we did it.¬† This is super niche.¬†

  
 *(Read time: \~10 minutes. Grab a coffee ‚òï)*

# üß© HOW IT STARTED

About a year ago, my team managing our cleaning business were drowning in filtering through job posts, texts, ‚Äúghosted‚Äù interviews, and piecing together a bunch of different tools to try to manage our hiring.¬†

So I built a small internal tool ‚Äî something to post jobs, track applicants, and send reminders.

It wasn‚Äôt fancy, but it worked. Most of the time.

Showed it to cleaning companies in our Facebook group and people liked it.  
  
Turned it into a saas and first week, got the first 20 paid users, got a message like:

‚ÄúNeeds a bunch of stuff, but I actually feel¬† more *in control* of my hiring.‚Äù

At this stage that‚Äôs good enough for me. Alright let‚Äôs roll this thing out. Here‚Äôs how.¬†¬†

# üé® STEP 1: BRANDING & IDENTITY

Man look we‚Äôre living in the future now. I just used Chat Gpt to choose the name: Mopp and used Bolt to make the website.¬†

The first setup was simply to get people to request a manual landing page for their hiring and I just did it manually for them and then those folks needed a form anyhow so it was an easy (well not easy but easier)¬† upsell to get them to use Mopp for the form and tracking system.   
  
Here‚Äôs the actual snippet of the results of the ChatGPT prompt it gave me to give to Bolt (Yeah using Ai to write prompts for anoother AI lol) üì∏:  
  
So folks would go to that link, request a free hiring landing page and then I have leads to upsell to.   
  
We rebranded from a ‚Äútool‚Äù to a **trusted hiring platform** ‚Äî clear visuals, modern fonts, calm colors, and human copy.

**Design matters.**  
 When you‚Äôre asking business owners to trust you with their hiring pipeline, they have to *feel* like they‚Äôre in good hands.



# üß∞ STEP 2: THE PRODUCT

Our first promise was simple:

‚ÄúCreate your hiring application forms in under 5 minutes.‚Äù

So the hiring application form connects directly to your applicant tracker ‚Äî where you can see, message, and rate every candidate.

From there, we kept expanding:

* ‚úÖ **Branded hiring pages** (generated with your logo + colors + branding)  
* üì¨ **Auto follow-up emails + SMS reminders**  
* üë• **Applicant tagging + team notes**  
* üß† **Video screening questions built into the application**  
* üåê **Public job sharing link for social posts**  

We wanted Mopp to feel super easy *for hiring*, plug in your info and start receiving applicants instantly.

üì∏ *\[Application form funnel:*



# üß™ STEP 3: REAL-WORLD TESTING

We launched with 22 cleaning companies.

They were all different sizes, so folks were putting up forms managing multiple job types and one lady onboarded 30+ cleaners in a couple days.

Plus I use it for my own stuff as well (scratch your own itch type thing. My favorite types of businesses to build)

üì∏ *\[Photo: Dashboard:¬† \]*



# üöÄ STEP 4: MARKETING

Bruh ain‚Äôt no ad budget for this.  
 So we went back to where it all started: **Facebook**.

I wrote posts breaking down our journey ‚Äî no sales pitch, just story and transparency.

And then for the people that asked for a free landing page I just asked them to repost it on their page as a thank you.

No fancy funnels. No paid ads. Just word of mouth and a little social proof.

üì∏ *\[Screenshot: post i made in facebook groups: \]*  
*Comments and asking them to post on their profiles:* 

# üèóÔ∏è STEP 5: INFRASTRUCTURE & SCALE

I know this is all new, so not saying we got the next Unicorn on our hands. But even if I get this to $5k a month that will be more than 99% of the projects online anyhow. And I think I‚Äôll get there in like 3 months.¬†

We were onboarding by hand for the landing page but that‚Äôs more of a perk. DO THINGS THAT DON‚ÄôT SCALE THEY SAY.   
  
 But the rest of it is automated everything:

* ‚öôÔ∏è Instant setup flow (coded that with Bolt as well). I use ‚Äúcoded‚Äù loosely. I can‚Äôt write a single line of codE.  
* üí≥ Stripe subscriptions for recurring billing  
* üìà Internal analytics for applicant volume  
* üì¨ Custom email sending via Resend + DreamHost
* Ready made Forms so they can start getting applicants without spending a second tinkering with anything.   

Now, when a company signs up, their application form is live instantly..

üì∏ *\[Screenshot: Ready made form: \] I know what they want so why make them have to do any work when they can just copy form and go.*

# üí∞ RESULTS SO FAR

In the first 7 days we have processed **a couple hundred applications** through the platform.

Some businesses went from getting zero applicants to **3 or 4 in one day**.  
And on the business side, 22 customers with like 12 in the pipeline with custom landing pages done.



# üß≠ WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT

The roadmap‚Äôs stacked:

* üß† **AI screening** (auto-rank candidates by quality)  
* üîÅ **Reactivation campaigns** (reach out to past applicants automatically)  
* üîó **ConvertLabs integration** (sync with client CRM)  
* üåé **Job syndication** (post one job and it posts automatically to 100 job boards)
* Background checks   



# ‚ö°Ô∏è TAKEAWAYS

Man just build something.

Use AI. If you can‚Äôt code, AI can get you 90% there and you can plug in the other 10% with a developer so it‚Äôs a lot less expensive to get started.

Learn and get good. Everything I learned from older projects ‚Äî product design, automation, storytelling, community building ‚Äî is baked into Mopp.  
  
You don‚Äôt need to learn to code. Stahp. You‚Äôre just shooting yourself in the foot.  
  
Solve your own problems first. Love building stuff that I need. It‚Äôs a reminder that I‚Äôm not special. If I need it, somebody else on the planet needs it to.   
  
Do things that don‚Äôt scale. Don‚Äôt be afraid of doing things manually in the beginning (still got some landing pages to build when I‚Äôm done with this.

And we‚Äôre just getting started.



# üß∞ TOOLS THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE

* üß± **ConvertLabs** ‚Äì backend + CRM  
* üíå **Resend + DreamHost** ‚Äì domain email delivery  
* üí≥ **Stripe** ‚Äì payments + subscriptions  
* üß≠ **Bolt and Chat GPT** ‚Äì design + onboarding flows  
* üîÑ **Twilio + Postmark** ‚Äì text + email automation  
* üßæ **Notion + Linear** ‚Äì product + support tracking  
* üì¶ **Google Sheets** ‚Äì our original MVP chaos that somehow worked lol

¬†

**Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?**

Yes, it was absolutely expected I attend college.¬† Growing up, I did not realize there were other options and remember feeling surprised when classmates of mine did not apply to college.¬† My parents were very involved in helping with school. I remember my dad researching scholarship opportunities so I could apply to as many as possible.¬† I received a merit-based full-ride (tuition/room and board) to a public university in my state as well as various smaller scholarships of which I don‚Äôt recall the details. ¬†My parents had about $30,000 in a 529 for me (initial funds came from my great-grandparents) which I used to pay for a summer abroad, off-campus housing my senior year, and later for a portion of my Masters. I paid for the rest of my Masters with savings as I worked full-time as an RN during my two-year program.

**Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?**

My dad was the parent who educated me about larger financial topics such as investing. My mom taught me more about day-to-day financial topics like price-comparing when grocery shopping. One of her points of pride was finding a 1 cent error the bank made while balancing her checkbook. ¬†My brother and I had kids‚Äô checking accounts where you would get small rewards and stamps in your booklet if you made a deposit. I became very interested in personal finance after taking a class in college.¬† I asked my dad then about investing for retirement and he is often a ""go to"" what I have questions, although now I have the resource of the entire Internet.¬† I listen to financial podcasts, shout out to Ramit Seethi and 'Money for Couples,' and I love learning about others‚Äô finances (this may be because I am nosy).¬† I also am a member of the FIRE subreddit and my husband and I do plan to retire, or at least switch to part-time work, early.

My parents were frugal in our everyday life, think cars, meals, and clothes although they were generous when it came to vacations and extracurricular activities.¬† Growing up, I understood that this was more of a quirk than a necessity.¬† I have had to unlearn the idea that spending money is inherently bad and have tried to find ways to intentionally increase spending in ways that bring me joy. At times, I still feel embarrassed to tell my parents how much I spent on something ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù such as a fancy dinner out.

**What was your first job and why did you get it?**

My first W2 job was when I was 15 as a lifeguard at my neighborhood pool. I made $7.25 an hour. I honestly got this job because I idolized the lifeguards at the pool growing up. I wanted a tan and a belly button ring so badly! Unfortunately, the job was super boring and not glamorous at all. My fair skin did not tan, but I did get really good at twirling a whistle.

**Did you worry about money growing up?**

No, we lived in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and took a vacation every year. My mom stayed at home with my brother and me until I was in high school when she began working as an elementary school teacher. My parents were very frugal, so I remember being annoyed they didn‚Äôt buy me the clothes I wanted (typical pre-teen), but I never worried. One of the most embarrassing moments of my preteen years was when the sliding door fell off our very old minivan in the school's carpool lane.¬†

My dad retired when he was very young, I think 42, while I was still in high school. He worked a stressful and demanding but high paying job and was totally burned out. This is something that has had a big impact on my worldview and I think about a lot. On one hand, I am so impressed that this was possible for him especially as I know he grew up solidly lower middle class.¬† On the other hand, I do not feel he has been making the most of his retirement.¬† He didn't start any hobbies, volunteer work, or even regular exercise.¬† Instead, he manufactures his own stress by fixating on insignificant details. For example, he has been working on updating my childhood home and it takes him literally 10 times as long to finish a project as it should. This has made me think about the concept of ""retiring to something.""¬† At this point in my life, I do not have a ton of time for hobbies or exercise, but it is important to me to build a life worth retiring to.¬† I will say things have improved in last couple of years. My children are his first grandchildren, and he is incredibly involved with them.¬† He also started volunteering regularly and I think these things have given him something more productive to direct his energy toward.

**Do you worry about money now?**

I think almost everyone worries about money a little. I have the privilege of not worrying much. I am definitely an ‚Äúoptimizer‚Äù so I think about money way more than I should. My husband and I have such an incredible nest egg that will keep growing. We both work in stable fields where layoffs are unlikely. Our monthly expenses feel tight with childcare costs, and we are not saving nearly as much as we used to, but when I step back and look at the big picture I feel good about our financial situation. I want to provide my daughters with the same security.

**At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?**

I became financially responsible for myself when I moved to another state with my then boyfriend, now husband after undergrad. I lived off savings for 2 months before starting full-time RN job. We have a huge safety net with my parents who are well-off (I assume) and willing to help us. Both of our brothers would also float us some cash or give us a short-term place to stay if we needed. We could stay with either of my in-laws as a last resort.

**Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.**

Yes, both my husband and especially me have received inheritances. This is the part of the diary where I know I become less relatable, and I fear less likable. My husband received 10k after the death of his grandma when we were in our early 20‚Äôs. I have received a total of 214k in my lifetime, 9k while I was in college, 60k at age 25, 120k at age 27 (all after passing of grandparents) and then a 25k gift from my parents when I was 30. We also received 30k for our wedding (20k from my parents, and 5k from each of my husband‚Äôs parents) which took place in 2018. I am so thankful for what my family has done for me. Their generosity allows me to work part-time so I can spend more time with my daughters. I am working on being more generous through donations and with things like holiday gifts to our wonderful daycare teachers, but I know I could be doing more.

¬†

**Day 1: Wednesday** ¬†

6:30- Alarm goes off and I nurse my 5-month-old baby, we will call her B, in bed before getting ready for work. My husband, A, typically gets our 3.5-year-old daughter, K, ready for daycare while I get myself and B ready. B is not a good sleeper and we are struggling in the mornings.

7:30- I drop B and K off at daycare which is only 2 minutes from my work. I do 98% of the drop-offs and pick-ups due to proximity. I head to work and sort through emails and tasks that have come through over the last 4 days. I left at noon on Friday feeling sick and I have a busy day of playing catch up ahead of me. I eat overnight oats with peanut butter and drink coffee while stopping for a pump break around 9- I got 5 oz.¬†

12:00- I stop for lunch at my desk after seeing patients all morning. I have been keeping up with today‚Äôs charting but still have some notes to finish from last week. I work on these while eating chili, chips, and raspberries brought from home. At 12:30, I drive the 2 minutes to daycare to nurse B over my break. I love the extra baby snuggles and am glad to have one less pumping session during the day.

1:00-Back at work, I see more patients and finish all my notes from last week! I work in an outpatient specialty clinic and typically see 10-14 patients per day depending on if they are new or established. I get 60 minutes for new patients and 30 minutes for established patients. I take a pump break around 3 and get 2 oz which is typical for the afternoon.

4:00- I pick up the girls from daycare. They are both in good spirits and we have an enjoyable car ride home. K was sick over the weekend and must not have fully recovered her appetite because she only eats half of her fruit snacks. I call my mom to say hi before her parent/teacher conferences. ¬†Our house cleaner came today (included in monthly costs) so the house feels and smells amazing when I walk in. I nurse B, then leave both girls with A to go pick up our dog from daycare (included in monthly). He got a nail trim which is extra ($19).

5:30-We eat freezer burritos (meal-prepped before B was born in the Spring) and fruit for dinner. I have 2 Heavenly Hunks from Costco for dessert. K is still low-energy so we let her watch a movie this evening. She chooses The Little Mermaid. We all play and read with K and then take a short walk before bedtime to admire the Halloween decorations in our neighborhood.

7:00-7:30- B goes to bed and we start bedtime for K. She gets her PJ‚Äôs and pull up on and we snuggle up for story and general bedtime chit chat. Tonight, she wants to talk about Sharks and getting shots. We tuck K in without much incident and she falls asleep quickly.

8:00- I order a few basics from Old Navy, t-shirts and a couple pairs of black leggings ($79.20). I am struggling with my larger body after my second baby. My clothes aren‚Äôt fitting well and I am working on rebuilding a wardrobe that makes me feel good. I finally found some jeans last week so I‚Äôm in better shape. Luckily, I just wear scrubs to work so that makes things easier. I take my dog for a walk around the neighborhood and see a fox! When I get home, I am delighted to see that A packed my lunch, got bottles and pump stuff ready for tomorrow, and reassembled the newly cleaned car seat that K threw up in over the weekend. I unload the dishwasher while chatting with A.

10:30- Shower, take my meds (Zoloft and an antihistamine) and read before bed. I only have the mental capacity for ‚Äúcomfort books‚Äù which for me are cozy mysteries and romances.

11:00- B wakes up and wants to nurse, I can‚Äôt tell if I had fallen asleep yet or not. She takes a half hour to settle back down which is a new, unwelcome development.

TOTAL: $98.20

**Day 2: Thursday**

2:00- Another baby wake up, we are trying not to nurse her to sleep every time, but in the middle of the night the willpower goes out the window. I nurse her again, but she still takes awhile to settle. ¬†

6:00- B is up again 30 minutes before the alarm so no way am I getting back to sleep. FML. I nurse her and get ready for the day. A gets both B and K ready this morning.

7:30-Drop the girls off at daycare and settle into work. I do fine seeing patients, but am having trouble writing notes because my brain is mush this morning. I ask my staff nurse if she has seen my stethoscope while I am wearing it. She gives me a hug and reassures me that I will be okay.¬† I pump 4.5 oz around 9 while eating overnight oats and drinking coffee.

11:00- I take an early lunch (pretty much same as yesterday) at my desk while finishing up notes, budgeting (I have a homemade excel spreadsheet that has evolved over the years), and working on this money diary. I also print a return label for some jeans that didn‚Äôt work out since we don‚Äôt have a printer at home. I go nurse B at noon today before seeing my afternoon patients. I take a pump break and 3 and get 3 oz.

4:30: We are home! I fix K some dinner and help her get ready for gymnastics. A finishes up work around 5 and we all play outside until it is time for A and K to leave. B seems sleepy, so I put her down for a short nap. I eat dinner (burritos again), package up my return, and get some household stuff done during naptime. I also pay for a Wreath-Making workshop my friends and I are doing together next month ($65.38). Once B is up, we get in some tummy time and snuggles. I am loving the baby stage way more the second time around, well every except the sleep struggles.

6:45- A and K get home from gymnastics. She always has so much fun! We change into pjs and take another Halloween Decoration focused walk as a family. We take the dog too, when ends up being a mistake. He gets spooked by a jump scare decorated (me too buddy) and nearly wrenches my shoulder out of it‚Äôs socket trying to bolt.

7:30- I get B off to bed while A and K chill downstairs. Once I‚Äôm down we do story and bedtime cuddles and chat. Tonight we make spiders with our hands and count how many legs they have. It‚Äôs always so interesting to me which topics she chooses!

8:00- We start making a big pot of gumbo while watching Thursday night football. A does the chopping while standing at a folding table we set in front of the TV while I go back and forth between the kitchen and the game.

9:30- I go upstairs to take a shower, do meds, and read. A finishes up the gumbo and puts it away while watching the rest fourth quarter. Looks like it will be Chargers win which is who I chose in our pick‚Äôem league this week. We turn off the lights a little before 10:30.

11:00- B wakes up to nurse and I definitely haven‚Äôt fallen asleep yet. A and I decide he will go sleep in the office (we have a twin bed set up in there) so that way one of us can get some rest. We will switch if I‚Äôm getting frustrated.

TOTAL: $65.38

**Day 3: Friday**

1:30 and 4AM- B wakes up to nurse, she settles back to sleep quickly

5:15- Another wake up, I nurse B, but she has trouble going back to sleep. After about 10 minutes of trying, I bring her to A and sleep in the office until I‚Äôm up for the day at 6:45. I get myself and B ready.

7:00- Disaster strikes! I open the fridge to get B‚Äôs prepped bottles and my lunch. I notice a bad smell and quickly realize the fridge isn‚Äôt cold! I take the temp of B‚Äôs bottles and they are at 63¬∞F and must be tossed. Everything perishable in the fridge must go including my lunch and all of the gumbo we made last night. Huge Bummer. I call daycare and they let me bring in frozen milk just this once. They will thaw it and put it in bottles for B.

8:00- I finally get to work after dropping off K and B at daycare. K has a small meltdown because we forgot to bring a toy for Friday's show and tell. Luckily the director lets her pick something from the office to borrow. Of course, my manager sees me coming in late and she definitely notices. I see my morning patients and get my charting done. I pump 5.5 oz around 9 while drinking coffee and eating Belvitas with a ton of peanut butter slathered on top since my overnight oats went in the trash can.

¬†12:00- I head over to nurse B and bring them my pumped milk for her afternoon bottle. I head to the provider lounge to see what they have for lunch. It‚Äôs soup day which is my least favorite. I just can‚Äôt do another bowl of chili, so I get some cottage cheese, fruit, and crackers and call it a girl lunch but really it‚Äôs just sad. I try not to fantasize about warm gumbo on this rainy fall day. I pump a few ounces before my last patient of the day.

4:15- I‚Äôm off at a good time. I pick up the girls from daycare and drive home. When we get there, my parents have just arrived. We typically see them every weekend, but they will be in St. Louis on Saturday and Sunday visiting my brother. They don‚Äôt like to go too long without seeing their granddaughters. A and I are somewhat secondary. It works at well that they are here as I have some prep to do before I go out tonight. I‚Äôm part of a local moms association and I am helping put on a Wine Night this evening! Tonight is a French Wine tasting of 7 different wines from France of varying styles. We are providing the wine, food, and we pay a lovely sommelier who is friends with one of our members. My job is to pick up the food from a local restaurant called French Market and to drop it off at the host‚Äôs house before the event starts. A comes with me and we pick up a seasonal quiche, salad composee, beef bourguignon, and chocolate mousse for dessert. My portion of the cost was pre-paid several weeks ago. After dropping off the food, we run by Culvers as I need to eat something before the event, and we don‚Äôt have anything for dinner. We get burgers for ourselves and my parents, K gets a kid‚Äôs meal with a burger, fries, and chocolate milk ($34.10). I get myself ready while K and B hang with my parents. I nurse B one last time and give K lots of hugs.

7:00 A drops me off at wine night while my parents do bath and bed for K while watching B. A tells me the next day that he got gas on the way home ($33.92). I have so much fun with my friends and learn a lot about French wine. My favorites are the Champagne (Henri Laffard Grand Reserve Brut Champagne $24.99/bottle) and the ChaÃÇteauneuf-du-Pape Red which is a Grenache Mourvedre blend that I couldn‚Äôt find on the TJ‚Äôs website. The sommelier leaves after our tasting and we stay to talk and drink for a couple more hours, I get a ride home from a friend who was the DD tonight (she‚Äôs pregnant and just came for the friend time). I head right to be after getting home around 11:30.

¬†TOTAL; $160.38

¬†**Day 4: Saturday**

1:00, 4:30, and 7:30- B wakes up and nurses

9:15- A. gets up with K around 8 and lets me sleep in. I wake up around 9 and nurse B in bed. I laze around for a half hour or so before getting up for the day. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised that I am only slightly hungover. I drink a big glass of water and take 600mg of ibuprofen for my headache and omeprazole for my reflux. We heat up a frozen broccoli cheddar quiche from Costco for breakfast.

10:30- We have a morning of household tasks like laundry, dishes, and cleaning which seems never-ending with a family of 4 + dog. We make the final decision on a fridge and buy something very similar to what we have now, but a different brand that is hopefully more reliable. It‚Äôs a GE with French doors and a bottom freezer ($1,717.01 includes installation and haul away). They can deliver it tomorrow! We decide to transition B from her SNOO (a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù bassinet) into a crib as her sleep has been so awful. The SNOO was in our room and the crib will be in the spare bedroom/office which will be an adjustment. We deep clean the office since our dog usually sleeps in there to get things ready for her. A sets up the crib which takes a while as we have to locate some missing hardware. I open the mattress box and realize we won‚Äôt be able to do the crib tonight because the mattress has to sit out for at least 24 hours.

5:00- I honestly don‚Äôt know where the rest of the day goes, but we take a family walk around 5 during a break in the rain. We usually play at a park on weekend days, but the weather has been uncooperative. It feels so nice to get outside and move after feeling cooped up.

7:00-7:30 Bedtime for the girls. K goes down first tonight. We do bath, story, and snuggles. Tonight she wants to talk about aquariums. Soon after, B starts to fuss and I nurse her before starting her bedtime. A and I watch some Schitt‚Äôs Creek before bed. We watched the who series about 5 years ago and are re-visiting it now. We just started season 2.

10:00- Early bedtime tonight as we are worn out. I shower, read, and do a dream feed for B before lights out. A sleeps in the office tonight so he can get some good rest before taking over for B.

TOTAL: $1,717.01

¬†**Day 5: Sunday**

12:30-B wakes up, nurses, and settles quickly

3:00- B wakes up, nurses, and does not settle this time. I try for about 45 minutes before giving up and switching with A as I am starting to feel frustrated with her. I sleep in the office until 7:30 which is the longest stretch of sleep I have had in months!

9:00 -We eat quiche for breakfast again. This time it‚Äôs spinach artichoke, luckily K loves quiche. It‚Äôs an easy way to get in a serving of veggies. I can‚Äôt wait for our fridge to be delivered later, we have be relying way to heavily on freezer meals. We all play pretend together where K is the mom and we are the kids. She loves when we misbehave!

12- We watch the first round of football games while playing with K, snuggling B, and tending to house stuff-mostly laundry today. We bring out a special toy during the football games so that K has something to occupy her. We have peanut butter and honey sandwiches for lunch. I give B a teeny bit of the peanut butter for allergy prevention. She is going to be able to start trying more foods so soon! K has rest time around 1:00.

2:00- Our Lowe‚Äôs Delivery arrives! I am upstairs nursing B and what I overhear from downstairs doesn‚Äôt sound good. Apparently, they are unable to install the fridge because our waterline is copper which is a liability. We have to have a plumber out to change our line before it can be installed. Ugh, it‚Äôs always something. We reschedule for Tuesday in hopes we can get a plumber out tomorrow.

3:30- We need something fun after the last few days. I buy tickets to Faulkner‚Äôs Ranch ($92.39 plus $13.22 on pumpkins) which is a pumpkin patch/Fall attraction venue. I planned to go went the weather was a little better, but the Fall drizzle shows no sign of letting up and this is the last weekend we can go. There is a light rain the whole time we are there, but we all have a blast! Our tickets include all the attractions, plus a pony-ride for K, food for the petting zoo, and a dozen pumpkin spice donuts. We do so many activities, K‚Äôs favorites are the tractor ride, climbing a giant stack of hay bales, and playing on an inflatable obstacle course. The plus side of the weather is that there is hardly anyone else there, so we don‚Äôt have to wait in any lines. A wears B in the carrier and she loves taking it all in. ¬†We pick a few pumpkins to carve later this week. This ends of being one of those perfect afternoons where I really feel like we are making memories. We each have a pumpkin spice donut in the car.

6:00- We head to Meddy‚Äôs, a local fast casual chain with a mediterranean focus for dinner ($36.40). I have roasted garlic chicken, potatoes, and vegetables, A has a hummus bowl with steak on top, and K has chicken tenders with fries. We leave maybe 5 minutes too late because B cries the whole way home.

7-7:30- We get B and K off to bed. First night in the crib-time please stop!

8:00- I have another donut and walk the dog. We watch Sunday Night Football while finishing up a few chores and chatting. I talk to my mom on the phone for a while.

10:00- I do a Dream Feed for B and the usual bedtime routine of showering and reading. I don‚Äôt have much of a skincare routine, just LaRoche Posay cleanser and moisturizer. I use tretinoin and spironolactone when I‚Äôm not pregnant or breastfeeding. My acne is mostly hormonal so my skin has been good without my normal menstrual cycle. Lights out at 10:30.

TOTAL: $142.02

**Day 6: Monday**

4:00 & 7:00- First wake up isn‚Äôt until 4 AM-Bliss! I nurse B and she goes back down quickly both times.

8:15- We are up for the day and I‚Äôm feeling better rested than I have in months! I nurse B while K gets herself dressed for the morning. She has an English Muffin and our last apple for breakfast.

9:30- My dad arrives. He comes on Monday mornings and takes K for a few hours. He brings us some pie and pizza purchased during their drive home yesterday. The pizza is from Shakespeare‚Äôs which is a classic Columbia, Missouri institution. The pie is from Peggy Jean‚Äôs which is also in Columbia. My dad grew up there and my parents met at Mizzou, so I have eaten Shakespeare‚Äôs many a time and find it sentimental. Today, my dad and K go to a story time at the library followed by play at a park. He takes her to lunch at McDonalds since we have no food. While they are gone and B naps, I go to Price Chopper for a quart of milk, eggs, 2 blocks of cheese, one yogurt which I eat with lunch, honeycrisp apples, pears, broccoli, bananas and an avocado ($22.37). Being able to run errands during naps is a major benefit of A working from home. I also fold some laundry and do dishes. When B gets up, we enjoy some on-on-one interaction time. I have my leftover garlic chicken, potatoes, and freshly bought yogurt for lunch. A. has the pizza.

1:00- K gets home and heads to her room for rest. B naps again which works out well since the plumber here. He replaces our copper line with a plastic line with a shut-off. He says copper is a better product so we may want to switch the lines back out once the install is complete‚Ä¶ I guess no industry is immune to bureaucracy ($338.21). K is up around 3:30. We watch the first part of Bambi before getting ready for swim lessons.

¬†5:30- A takes K to swim lessons at our local YMCA. Today is the last session and we will probably pause until the Spring. B and I hang out while I prep dinner. We have roasted broccoli and lemon pepper salmon for dinner. I have a bowl of vanilla ice cream with the pie my parents brought for us for dessert.

7:15: We start bedtime and turn on the Chief‚Äôs game. I handle B‚Äôs bedtime and most of K‚Äôs since A is a much bigger football fan and wants to watch every minute. We do a 15-minute HIIT video during halftime, we are trying to do this together twice per week. I watch the game until the 4^(th) quarter when I start getting ready for bed. The Chief‚Äôs win! I end up with 9 picks right this week (winner had 10) so not bad. Lights out a little later tonight, closer to 11.

TOTAL: $360.58

**Day 7: Tuesday**

12:30, 3:30, and 7: B wakes up and nurses.

8:00-We are all up for the day! My husband commutes his 30 steps to the office and I nurse B while snuggling in bed with K. A brings me a doppio espresso with milk in bed, which I savor while managing not to spill. We got an espresso machine for A‚Äôs birthday recently and are still perfecting the shot. We went with a Breville Barista Pro that we purchased on sale for about $550. We have been using espresso beans from a local roastery called Oddly Correct. The girls and I have a nice slow morning. We mix getting dressed and having breakfast with lots of pretend play for K and cuddles for B. I put blueberry muffin tops (a freezer dough) in the oven.

10:00- We leave for playgroup at a friend‚Äôs house. I bring the warm blueberry muffin tops to share. I am part of a group of moms that has been meeting most Tuesdays for almost 3 years now! We have all become close friends and though the group has changed throughout the years, some moves, new babies added, and older kids off to pre-school, it has held steady. K plays with 2 friends while I talk with the mom‚Äôs and drink coffee. Much needed friend time for both me and K. ¬†One of the moms brings a baby Cinderella costume for B to borrow for Halloween.

12:30- We head home for lunch, I make sausage (from the freezer), egg, and cheese English muffins for everyone. K goes to rest in her room and B is napping so I take the opportunity for a 15-minute catnap.

2:00- Our fridge has been delivered and installed successfully! I am so relieved. K loves watching the installation process. ¬†

3:00- It‚Äôs been drizzling all day, but we try to sneak in some park time when things are a little lighter. We are there for about 10 minutes before the rain starts coming down hard and K and I are soaked! She hates wet clothes, so she rides home in her car seat completely naked. We towel her off and settle in for a movie. She chooses Jungle Book today. I do some cleaning and start the potatoes for dinner tonight while she watches the movie.

5:00- We have sliced apples and baked potatoes topped with butter, shredded cheddar, and bacon for dinner. This is the last of the thick-cut bacon A. smoked and froze a couple of months ago. Our meals have been funky without the fridge, we usually eat a lot more veggies, I swear! After dinner, A leaves to pick up a double BOB stroller we got off Facebook Marketplace ($100). We loved the UppaBaby Vista when it was just my older daughter, but as a double stroller it drives like a boat. I will sell the UppaBaby on FBM if we like the new one.

6:00- Dress up and pretend play for K and tummy time/bouncer for B. I make an amazing Ursula, though I do give Ariel legs for free instead of charging her one voice which doesn‚Äôt seem like a sustainable business practice.

7:00- We start the bedtime process. We read and sing to B while K is in the shower. Once B is down in the crib, we do story time with K and tuck her into bed for more snuggles and chit chat. We talk about playgroup and Halloween tonight. Once the girls are asleep, A and I work on the new fridge. We put in the drawers and transfer our food from the minifridge in the basement. I do some general clean up while listening to music. A does the bottles/pump stuff/lunch for tomorrow and then goes upstairs to play 2 rounds of Counterstrike.

9:00- I head upstairs to start winding down. I roll out my sore glutes with a tennis ball and take a long, hot shower. I remember to order a princess crown for K‚Äôs Halloween costume. I also order some Elsa, Anna, and Rapunzel hair accessories which I plan to save for Christmas ($19.66). I dream feed B and read before turning out the lights at 10:15.

¬†**Reflection:**

Obviously, this was not a normal week of spending for us with the need for the new refrigerator and the associated plumber visit. I do feel like with kids and a dog, there is an unexpected expense almost every month, but usually not to the tune of $2000.¬† This also threw off our food spending.¬† We ate out the usual number of times although we almost never have fast food. Additionally, we did not have our weekly grocery shop where we typically spend between $100 and $150. Otherwise, this was a pretty normal week for our family. Phew! This took a lot of time and effort to write! I felt like I was super long winded, but still didn't manage to capture everything that happens in a day. B nurses and naps and K eats more frequently than reported. My dog also gets 2 square meals per day and a lot more attention and love than reported.

(We're talking stars, planets, and moons, of course)","Now that the darkness has descended upon us (well, in this case the natural kind), we know a lot of folks are getting ready to go into hibernation. For those that aren't, it's a great time check out the winter night sky, and you can do that right here in the heart of the city.

Starting next Wednesday, November 5, Civic Center Conservancy, in partnership with Boulder-based Astro Tours, brings back **STARGAZE**, a weeknight astronomy event for all folks that love to learn about the night sky. We'll be setting up 7-10 high-powered telescopes in Civic Center Park staffed by professional astronomers who will tell you about our nearby space neighbors, including planets, satellites (like our moon), and distant stars (yes, you will see stars!). Sure, you may think that all the light pollution would make it impossible to see any stars in the sky, but with their high-powered telescopes, we promise you'll see them! (We do have inclement weather alternate dates in case the weather doesn't play nice.)

We'll also have food trucks selling savory and sweet offerings (for November we have The Balkan European, which makes sweet and savory Hungarian fried bread creations) and warm beverages with Astro Coffee Van to keep the chilly willies away.

**Tickets are only $5 per person** (kids under 5 are free with a paying adult), and these funds go to help our non-profit org offset the costs to put on the event, including paying the astronomers, and to help keep the park clean, safe, and beautiful (we definitely aren't lining anyone's pockets). Tickets are set up in 50-person sessions to keep them nice, small, and intimate (and to ensure you don't have to wait in a ginormous line to look at the telescopes).

Upcoming dates and time:

\- November 5: 5:30 - 7:30 PM

Many of these tools have generous free tier options and a lot of value even in the $20 /mo Gemini plan.  Many of these offerings are not available in ChatGPT. This post is a comprehensive guide to what they are (from video/image generation to app building), their best use cases, pro tips, and a breakdown of the free vs. paid plan limits for October 2025. Save this post.**

You can't scroll for 30 seconds without seeing ChatGPT.  Everyone is talking about it, and for good reason. But the conversation often stops there, and most people think AI is just a single chatbot.

Google has quietly integrated an entire *ecosystem* of incredibly powerful AI tools, and many of them can be tried for free.   
  
Gemini is being used by over 400 million people are already.

Here‚Äôs the key difference: ChatGPT doesn't have tools like NotebookLM for summarization with audio / video overviews, Gemini in Sheets for data analysis, or a built-in App Builder. Google is building a connected suite, and you can get started for free.   The $20 a month Gemini plan arguably gives more value than the $20 a month ChatGPT plan.   

Oh, and one more thing: **The $20/month Gemini Advanced plan is 100% FREE for U.S. college students for a year.**

I've spent time digging into the full suite. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of 11 of these tools, their *real* use cases, pro-tips, and the ""hidden truths"" you should know.

\[Remember to  save this post for later! You'll want to refer back to this.\]

# 1. Firebase Studio

* **What It Is:** An AI-powered tool to quickly build and launch web app front-ends or websites. You describe what you want in a prompt, and it generates the code.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * Spinning up a landing page for a new product in minutes.
   * Creating a personal portfolio site without writing CSS.
   * Quickly prototyping an app idea to show investors or your team.
* **Pro Tip:** Be specific. Don't just say ""make a fitness app."" Say, ""Build a 3-page website for a yoga studio. The homepage needs a hero image, a 3-card layout for 'Classes,' and a contact form. The 'About' page needs a text block and an image. The 'Contact' page should have a map.""
* **The Hidden Truth:** It's a ""scaffolder,"" not a magic bullet. It's *amazing* at generating your front-end (HTML/CSS/JS), but you'll still need to handle complex backend logic (like user databases) yourself. It gets you 80% of the way there in 10% of the time.

# 2. Veo (Video Generation)

* **What It Is:** Google's high-definition, text-to-video model. You write a prompt, and it creates a video clip with consistent characters and motion.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * Creating unique b-roll footage for YouTube videos or presentations.
   * Visualizing a concept for a short film or ad.
   * Making short, eye-catching animated clips for social media.
* **Pro Tip:** Chain your prompts. Instead of one giant prompt, create your first scene. Then, use that scene's output to prompt the next, describing the *change* you want to see. This gives you more control over the story.
* **The Hidden Truth:** As of late 2025, it's still better at ""scenery and mood"" than ""complex physics and dialogue."" A shot of a ""NYC in the rain"" will look 10/10. A shot of ""two people arguing and then one of them throws a glass of water"" might look... weird. Use it for its strengths.  But Veo just keeps getting better to compete with Sora.  The latest version handles physics better and has some advanced options.  

# 3. Gemini Ask on YouTube

* **What It Is:** A chat interface built directly into the YouTube player. You can ask questions about the video, get summaries, or find specific moments.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * Watching a 2-hour lecture? Ask it, ""What are the key 5 takeaways from this video?""
   * Need to find a specific part? ""When does the host start talking about the new camera?""
   * Don't understand a topic? ""Explain the concept he mentions at 10:32 like I'm a beginner.""
* **Pro Tip:** Use it to find *other* content. After watching a video, ask, ""What are some related topics or creators I should watch next?""
* **The Hidden Truth:** The quality of its answers depends *entirely* on the quality of the video's auto-generated captions. If the captions are a mess, the AI's understanding will be, too.

# 4. Gems in Gemini

* **What It Is:** Google's version of custom GPTs. You can build your own custom AI assistant (a ""Gem"") using your own instructions, files, and data.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * **Study Buddy:** Feed it your class notes, textbooks (as PDFs), and lecture slides. Now you have a personal tutor you can quiz.
   * **Brand Voice:** Upload your company's style guides and past blog posts. Now you have a ""Brand Copywriter"" Gem that always writes in your exact tone.
   * **Recipe Assistant:** Give it 100 of your favorite recipes. Ask it, ""What can I make for dinner? I only have chicken, rice, and onions.""
* **Pro Tip:** The *Instruction* box is more important than the *Files*. Be *explicit* in your instructions. ""You are a helpful assistant. *When a user asks a question, first check your uploaded files for the answer. If you can't find it, say so. Do not make up information.*""
* **The Hidden Truth:** This is the *real* ""Gemini Advanced"" power. The *real* unlock is connecting it to your Google Drive and Google Calendar. It becomes a true personal assistant, but be *very* mindful of the permissions you grant it.

# 5. Nano Banana (Editing / Inpainting)

* **What It Is:** This is the ""editing"" feature within Google's image generation tools (like Imagen). You can select a part of an AI-generated image and change it with a new prompt.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * ""I like this image of a dog, but I want it to be wearing a hat."" -> Select the head, prompt ""a red party hat.""
   * ""This landscape is perfect, but the sky is boring."" -> Select the sky, prompt ""a dramatic sunset with clouds.""
   * ""Remove the person in the background."" -> Select the person, prompt ""remove.""
* **Pro Tip:** Use a *smaller* selection area than you think you need. The AI needs ""buffer"" room around your selection to blend the new pixels in realistically.
* **The Hidden Truth:** It's ""in-painting,"" not ""Photoshop."" It's not just *refining* the pixels; it's *re-imagining* them. This means you might lose some detail, but you can also create magical, impossible edits.

# 6. Gemini in Google Sheets

* **What It Is:** An AI formula and insight generator directly within Google Sheets.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * **Data Cleaning:** Select a column of messy names and addresses. Prompt: ""Clean this data, split names into first/last, and format all states as 2-letter codes.""
   * **Formula Generation:** ""I need a formula that pulls all the names from column A where the value in column B is over 500.""
   * **Text Generation:** ""Write a 2-sentence polite follow-up email for each person in this list.""
* **Pro Tip:** Use it for categorization. Have a thousand rows of customer feedback? Create a new column, select it, and prompt: ""Read the feedback in column C and categorize it as 'Pricing,' 'Feature Request,' or 'Bug Report'.""
* **The Hidden Truth:** This is secretly one of the most powerful tools for business users. It's not just for text; it's a mini-ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool. It can automate 80% of the ""data janitor"" work that analysts hate.

# 7. Google App Builder (in AI Studio)

* **What It Is:** A no-code/low-code feature *within* Google AI Studio (see #10). It lets you build and deploy simple web apps using prompts (this is also called ""vibe coding"").
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * **Internal Tools:** Build a simple app for your team to ""Track inventory,"" ""Submit vacation requests,"" or ""Log customer support tickets.""
   * **Workflow Automation:** Create an app that ""Takes an email, uses AI to summarize it, and saves it to a Google Sheet.""
* **Pro Tip:** Start with a template. Don't try to build from a blank canvas. Find a template that's *close* to your goal (e.g., ""Approval Workflow"") and customize it.
* **The Hidden Truth:** This is *not* for building the next billion-user social media app. This is for building *internal* line-of-business (LOB) apps and simple workflows. It's a ""Power Apps"" competitor, not a ""Bubble"" competitor.

# 8. Media Generation (Imagen/Nano Banana)

* **What It Is:** The main text-to-image generation tool. You write a short, simple prompt, and it creates instant visuals.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * Blog post hero images.
   * Quick visuals for a slide deck or presentation.
   * Brainstorming a mood board for a creative project.
* **Pro Tip:** ""Negative prompting"" is key. Most users just write what they *want*. The pros also write what they *don't* want. Example: ""A photo of a dog `[negative_prompt: cartoon, 3d render, low quality, blurry]`.""
* **The Hidden Truth:** All ""safe"" models (this included) are heavily ""opinionated."" They are biased towards a clean, sterile, ""corporate"" aesthetic. To get gritty, edgy, or truly unique art, you have to fight the model with very specific stylistic prompts (e.g., ""shot on film, 80s grain, cinematic, stark lighting"").   I have found in testing hundreds of images in ChatGPT and Gemni that Gemini generates much better images and it is also much faster.    You can also generate multiple image options at one time!

# 9. Gemini Live (Stream)

* **What It Is:** A real-time, conversational AI chat experience. You can talk to it, and it talks back instantly. It also supports screen sharing for meetings.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * **Meeting Assistant:** Share your screen during a meeting and have Gemini ""Take notes, list all action items, and create a 3-bullet summary at the end.""
   * **Presentation Practice:** Rehearse a presentation with it. Ask it to ""Give me feedback on my pacing"" or ""Ask me 3 hard questions about slide 5.""
   * **Brainstorming:** Use it as a ""rubber duck."" Just talk out your ideas, and it will help you organize them.
* **Pro Tip:** Use the screen-sharing ""context."" Don't just ask, ""What do you think?"" Ask, ""Based on the email I have on my screen, what are the three most urgent tasks?""
* **The Hidden Truth:** This is a game-changer, *but* it's only as good as the live transcription. Heavy accents, fast talking, or a bad mic can throw it off. Speak clearly, and it will work wonders.

# 10. Google AI Studio

* **What It Is:** The pro tool. This is a developer-focused playground to test Google's models (like Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc.), adjust advanced settings, and compare prompt results. This is also the home of the **Google App Builder** feature.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * Comparing Model A vs. Model B for the same prompt.
   * Fine-tuning the ""Temperature"" (creativity) and ""Top-P"" (randomness) settings.
   * Developing a prompt that will eventually be used in an app via an API.
* **Pro Tip:** The ""Temperature"" setting is the most important button.
   * `Temperature = 0.1`: For factual, predictable, repeatable results (like code, data extraction).
   * `Temperature = 0.9`: For creative, wild, brainstorming results (like poetry, marketing copy).
* **The Hidden Truth:** This is the test kitchen where the chefs (developers) work. Most users should stay in the main Gemini interface. But if you're a power user who *really* wants to see what the models can do, this is your sandbox.  ChatGPT does not have an app builder tht is nearly as polished - it only lets you create code but you can't easily publish it to GitHub or Google Cloud with one click.

# 11. NotebookLM

* **What It Is:** A research and learning tool. You ""ground"" the AI in your *own* sources (PDFs, Google Docs, web links), and it becomes an expert *only* on that material.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * **Students:** Upload your textbook and lecture notes. Ask it to ""Create a mind map of Chapter 5,"" ""Make a 20-question quiz on the 'Industrial Revolution',"" or ""Summarize my sources.""
   * **Researchers:** Upload 20 academic papers. Ask it to ""Find the common themes across all these sources"" or ""What is the main counter-argument to Source A, based on Source B and C?""
* **Pro Tip:** Do *not* upload one giant 500-page PDF. The AI works *much* better if you upload 5-10 smaller, more focused documents (e.g., individual chapters or papers).
* **The Hidden Truth:** This is, in my opinion, the most underrated and *useful* tool on the entire list for anyone in a knowledge-based field. It's not just a ""summary"" tool. It's a ""synthesis"" tool. The ""Audio Overview"" feature (which generates a mini-podcast based on your docs) is an absolute game-changer for learning on the go.

  
BONUS 

# 12. Gemini Deep Research

* **What It Is:** An ""agentic"" feature in Gemini Advanced that autonomously researches complex topics for you. It creates a research plan, browses hundreds of websites, and then writes a comprehensive, multi-page report with citations.
* **Top Use Cases:**
   * ""Give me a complete competitive analysis of \[My Competitor\], including their product line, pricing, and marketing strategy.""
   * ""Create a detailed report on the future of renewable energy, focusing on battery technology and grid-scale storage.""
   * ""I'm doing due diligence on \[Company Name\]. Find their recent product launches, financial health, and key executives.""
* **Pro Tip:** Your prompt is critical, but the *real* pro-move is to use the **""Edit plan""** button. Before it starts, Gemini shows you its ""table of contents."" Edit this plan to add, remove, or refine topics to ensure the final 10-minute report is *exactly* what you want.
* **The Hidden Truth:** This is *not* NotebookLM. NotebookLM *only* uses the files *you* give it (high accuracy, no new info). Deep Research *finds* all-new info from the web (high power, but you must verify its sources). Also, it's not instant it takes 5-10 minutes to run, so go grab a coffee - it is worth the wait.  I find Gemini has better Deep Research than ChatGPT (it scans 2X as many sources) 

# Free vs. Paid: Gemini Plan Limits (October 2025)

This is the question everyone asks: ""What's the catch?"" Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the *plausible* limits based on current plans.

|Tool|Free Plan (Gemini Standard)|Paid Plan (Gemini Advanced / Google One)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Media Generation**|\~100 image generations/day.|Priority access (no queues), 1,000+ generations/day.|

|**Ask on YouTube**|Available on most (but not all) videos.|Available on all videos, deeper analysis.|
|**Google AI Studio**|Generous free-tier API access for testing.|Higher rate limits for production API keys.|

# The barrier to entry for high-level creation is disappearing. It's no longer just about who has the most expensive software; it's about who has the best ideas.

Your ability to prompt, refine, and *integrate* these tools is the new superpower. Go build, create, and learn something amazing.

Prompting Gemini is different than prompting ChatGPT.   And prompting for images, videos, deep research all have different syntax.  Check out my prompt collections on these topics for free at [PromptMagic.dev](http://PromptMagic.dev)

1ojdk3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiboSuccessStories/comments/1ojdk3g/low_stomach_acid_was_the_culprit/,Low stomach acid was the culprit," I had hydrogen dominant SIBO but methane was also higher than it should be (tested with breath test). Main Symptom was diarrhoea. I had this problem for three years. I had colonoscopy, gastroscopy, blood tests, stool tests etc. with nothing to show for. I also did neomycin and rifamaxin for one round. Since I started taking betaine, I can tolerate much more foods and drink coffee. 

I either take 2 to 3 pills of betaine HCL or 1 to 2 tablespoons of ACV with a pinch of salt, squeeze some lemon, a pinch of salt diluted in warm water and then Ill add 1 tablespoon of honey. Always take HCL with food, never after a meal or on an empty stomach. Sometimes if I feel symptoms like gurgling, farting, burping or diarrhoea, Ill do the ACV mix after food, even if I had betaine. I guess my stomach acid is just that low. 

Also taking weed edibles, smoking weed, smoking cigs, alcohol and all other drugs need to be stopped until youre normal again. Im a stoner and took edibles/smoked weed almost ever day for years. I also drank alcohol like 3 times a week. I didnt get completely wasted, usually a few glasses of beer/wine. But all the drugs and smoking, mess with your lower lower esophageal sphincter. If the lower esophageal sphincter dysfunctions, things arent where they are supossed to be in your stomach. Like food, acid or bacteria cant be held back by the lower esophageal sphincter and start to cause GERD. Or they remain in the small intestine and start to ferment = sibo.",8,1761764933.0,SiboSuccessStories,1,1.0,False

# Why Reviews Matter More Than Ever

Guest reviews are the heartbeat of your **hosting success**. According to TripAdvisor Insights, over 90% of travelers read reviews before booking, and listings with 5-star feedback generate 35% more bookings than those without.

**Llivo** encourages hosts to lead with kindness and creativity, helping build authentic relationships that no algorithm can replicate.

  


# 1. The Power of a Personal Welcome

The smallest gestures often make the biggest impact. A handwritten note with the guest‚Äôs name or even a warm message before arrival can instantly make someone feel seen and valued.

**Examples that work wonders:**

* ‚ÄúWelcome to Dallas, Sarah! We hope your trip is as sunny as your stay.‚Äù  
* ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äôs on the counter, the Wi-Fi password‚Äôs on the fridge‚Äîmake yourself at home!‚Äù  

When guests feel personally greeted, they‚Äôre already halfway to leaving that five-star review.

See how to craft standout listings with a personal touch.



# 2. Add Comfort That Speaks Volumes

Little comforts show that you‚Äôve gone the extra mile. Even **budget-friendly touches** create an impression of thoughtfulness.

Try adding:

* A few bottles of cold water in the fridge.  
* A **small snack basket** or **local treat**.  
* **Extra pillows, slippers**, or a **cozy throw blanket**.  
* A printed map or list of local restaurants.  

These simple details cost little but deliver priceless feedback.

# 3. Go Beyond the Stay: Offer Local Insights

Guests love experiencing a destination like a local. Instead of generic brochures, share personal favorites such as:

* ‚ÄúTry the food trucks near Main Street after 6 PM.‚Äù  
* ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a hidden trail behind the park with the best sunset view.‚Äù  
* ‚ÄúAsk for the local roast at the corner caf√©‚Äîit‚Äôs not on the menu!‚Äù  

You can even offer **airport pickups** or **personalized tours** through Llivo‚Äôs flexible features. These gestures show guests they‚Äôre more than just a booking number.

  


# 4. Make Check-In Effortless

Travel days can be hectic. A smooth check-in process instantly relieves stress and sets a positive tone.

Here‚Äôs how to make it easy:

* Send detailed instructions with photos of the entrance.  
* Offer flexible check-in and check-out times when possible.  
* If you can, greet guests personally‚Äîit adds warmth and reassurance.  

When guests feel cared for the moment they arrive, you‚Äôve already earned their appreciation (and most likely their review).



# 5. Follow Up With Gratitude

After guests check out, a simple thank-you message can make all the difference. It shows professionalism, care, and invites honest feedback.

**Example:**

‚ÄúIt was a pleasure hosting you! I hope you enjoyed your time in Fort Worth. I‚Äôd be grateful if you could share your experience‚Äîit helps future guests find us, too.‚Äù

This small gesture increases the likelihood of receiving a detailed review that boosts your ranking and trust.

A bit about us/what we're looking for context is below. Generally we're open to most neighborhoods but don't have a good grasp on all the amazing places here:

\- We're both mid 30's, creatives with day-jobs. I primarily work from home as a music producer but would like to not be too far from commercial studios as I'm being booked outside the home more often. Having coffee shops or spaces to work outside the home would be ideal to help me keep my mental

\- Wife works 3x / week hybrid in Culver

\- Approx. budget/mo for rent is $3000-$4500

\- We are recently married, will like to start a family in the next year or so. So a walkable neighborhood that we can take a stroller around would be great!

\- we're not super interested in being by the beach, but are open to any recommendations there! We've also liked Studio City, Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Arts District

\- Ideally we'd like to rent a house or duplex, rather than an apartment. Not interested in buying. Space and natural light are very important since we both work from home a lot. Hopefully a little patio space but not 100% necessary.

\- We enjoyed WeHo/Hollywood but looking for more space, less commercial / touristy (though still near restaurants, coffee shops, local shops, grocery store, etc as mentioned above). We still like trendy, urban-to-semi-urban and artsy neighborhoods but also want a quiet-ish place to start our family

I wanted to share something that might give hope to anyone who‚Äôs currently fighting panic disorder and feels stuck.



A few months ago, random night, I ended up in the hospital **four times.** Every test came back normal ‚Äî but my heart rate was over 130 and blood pressure of 19, sometimes even more. They said it was a panic attack, but at that time I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It felt *too real* to be ‚Äújust anxiety.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt even sit at a caf√© without feeling my heart race out of control. I was terrified of my own heartbeat ‚Äî every little flutter made me think something was seriously wrong. I‚Äôd check my pulse over and over, convinced my heart would stop any second. That week, I almost everyday had panic attacks. Even the stress that comes with playing League was triggering the attack.

But things slowly began to change.

I started forcing myself to go outside, just a little at a time. One day it was sitting outside for a few minutes. Then I went to a caf√©, ordered a decaf coffee, and stayed ‚Äî even when my anxiety screamed at me to leave. I made it a rule: *each time, go a bit farther.*

So I did. I extended my distance little by little ‚Äî walking new routes, staying longer, and pushing my comfort zone just enough to show my brain that I was safe. And now? I can take public transportation to the mall and actually enjoy my time there.

My panic used to control everything I did. Now, I can feel a fast heartbeat or a wave of anxiety and not freak out. I let it pass. I remind myself, ‚ÄúThis is just my body reacting ‚Äî not a threat.‚Äù

To anyone reading this who feels like they‚Äôll never get better: you *will.* It‚Äôs not easy, but you‚Äôll get there step by step. Each time you face the fear, even for a few minutes, you‚Äôre teaching your brain that you‚Äôre okay.

Your body isn‚Äôt broken ‚Äî it‚Äôs just scared. Be patient with it. Use your strong mind to calm yourself, not to create fear. That‚Äôs what turned everything around for me.

You‚Äôve got this. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Use your mind as your ally, not your enemy. That‚Äôs when everything starts to change.

Also i took diary for this period, i'll post it as well when i finish translating it to English.

And now for the actual post.

So almost a year ago I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1h7naiy/trainfinetune_a_coding_llm_on_a_proprietary/) post asking for help on fine tuning an LLM.
 
Although it got very few comments, it was enough to send me down the rabbit hole of model fine tuning. 

I‚Äôve spent the past 11 months, self learning, experimenting like crazy and generally devouring any kind of resource I could find on the subject. I do feel like I‚Äôve made a lot of progress and have actually fine tuned dozens of models with varying levels of success (as per my training objectives). 

Past couple of months I feel like that progress has stagnated, and the models I‚Äôm fine tuning are getting good, but still not the expert level I am aiming for.

So why am I sharing all this? Cause I‚Äôm tired of having ChatGPT (ok, Gemini is pretty awesome too) as the only one I can consult with and brainstorm with. 

Although I‚Äôve been in ‚Äúthe industry‚Äù (mostly IT to be honest) for a quite few years, I don‚Äôt have anyone in my professional network who has the technical experience I‚Äôm looking for. 

I‚Äôm longing for a brief technical discussion with a **human**. Obviously someone who has some experience in fine tuning small-mid sized LLM‚Äôs that I can bounce my training recipes off of and get some constructive feedback. 

I know this is uncommon on Reddit. I‚Äôve been on this site forever, and the closest I‚Äôve gotten to actually ‚Äútalking‚Äù to someone on here (not through comments) were a few DM‚Äôs that are impossible to deep dive with. 

I‚Äôll be more than happy to (virtually) buy anyone willing to give up some time a coffee. Also, I‚Äôm no where near being an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù but if I‚Äôd be more than willing to reciprocate which such gesture. So anyone looking to brainstorm, talk code, model training, etc. hit me up!

Some things that worked: keeping a consistent wake up time even on weekends, writing before checking email or news, setting a realistic daily word count, mine was 300 words and even something as small as prepping the coffee maker the night before so I didn‚Äôt waste willpower first thing in the morning.

What didn‚Äôt work: trying to write after long, exhausting days, setting unrealistic daily goals that only led to guilt, juggling multiple projects at once, and waiting for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù writing conditions.

I worked with palmetto publishing for editing and printing since time management was already hard enough. Having everything in one place was worth it because it let me focus on actually writing.

The biggest surprise wasn‚Äôt just finishing the book, but how much better I felt having a creative outlet outside of work and training sessions. Writing turned into a kind of meditation practice that bled into other areas of life in a good way.",9,1761764280.0,writers,3,0.91,False

It‚Äôs been two years since she died. It sounds like a long time, but it isn‚Äôt ‚Äî not when every day drags behind like a shadow that never shortens.

Two years ‚Äî it sounds like enough time for healing, they said. But I still feel like I‚Äôm standing in the same place, just watching everything rot around me.

Morning comes, and I still wake up reaching for her side of the bed ‚Äî that quiet, cold half where the blanket folds untouched. The world kept going, and I didn‚Äôt. People talk to me like I‚Äôve moved on, like time has done its job. They don‚Äôt see that the days only got quieter, not kinder. I still come home to the same silence, the same air that smells faintly of her hair when the door opens, the same bed that feels like a grave. The house is a museum of a life that ended, but I‚Äôm the only exhibit that shouldn‚Äôt still be here.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve been doing. Work, eat, sleep ‚Äî the things that keep a body alive but not a soul. It all feels like pretending. Like I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs leftover life. The days are just loops ‚Äî coffee gone cold, memories that won‚Äôt fade, a body that moves because it has to. There‚Äôs no meaning in the motions anymore. Sometimes I catch myself forgetting her voice, and that‚Äôs the worst of it ‚Äî time can steal even that.¬†

I used to fear death; now it feels more like gravity, something pulling me back to where she is.

Now it‚Äôs just a life stretched thin ‚Äî empty, colorless, surviving out of habit, not hope.

Two years. The calendar says it‚Äôs a long time. But inside, it‚Äôs still that night. Still the last breath. Still the sound of the world ending quietly in my hands.

Two years, and I‚Äôm still counting time that doesn‚Äôt matter. She was my purpose, and when she left, so did the reason behind everything.

No one can understand how much I love her, not even her...",12,1761764000.0,widowers,1,1.0,False

Phil‚Äôs Story 

By Marcus Lacey 

 Chapter 1: The Last Shot

The ceramic of the coffee mug was cold in Phil‚Äôs hand, a stark contrast to the memory of the heat it had once held. It bit into his palm, a dull, persistent ache. His apartment was a symphony of minor malfunctions‚Äîthe low, grinding groan of the radiator, the sharp, percussive snap of pipes contracting within the walls, a faint, almost sub-sonic hum from the floorboards that he felt more than heard. It was the sound of a life in stasis, a machine idling on empty. Through the thin wall, laughter from his neighbors‚Äô party wove its way into the dusk, sharp and human, punctuated by the clink of glasses. A note, written in a soft, pleading cursive, had been slid under his door at six: *Come by at seven. Bring anything. Or nothing.* He had read it once, his stomach clenching, then crushed it into a tight, dense ball. It now teetered on the edge of his trash can, a monument to his indecision. Easier to hide than to face their inevitable, well-meaning question: *How‚Äôs the novel, Phil?* He hadn‚Äôt written a true, honest word in fourteen months. The shame of that silence burned in his gut, hotter than any coffee ever could.

He sat at the desk, a heavy, scarred thing that had witnessed more procrastination than prose. The laptop‚Äôs screen was a black mirror, reflecting the hollowed-out version of his own face back at him. The cursor pulsed. Short. Steady. A metronome counting down a life he no longer recognized. His fingers, moving with a will of their own, tapped out a single, damning sentence: *Once there was a man who thought he was a writer.*

The words sat there on the screen, raw and heavy, a confession he hadn't known he was ready to make. The radiator gave a sudden, violent hiss, a warning from the building itself. The screen flickered, a glitch in reality. When it stabilized, new text had appeared beneath his own, typed by no hand of his: *But he was the story. And the story is flawed.*

Phil‚Äôs breath caught, sharp and painful in his throat. His hands were in his lap. He hadn't touched the keys. The cursor continued to blink, calm, knowing, as if it saw straight through the fragile facade of Philip Brennan and into the emptiness beneath.

He slammed the laptop shut, the cheap plastic hinge squealing in protest. A chime rang through the room‚Äînot from his phone, not from the neighbors, but a hollow, resonant note that seemed to emanate from the walls themselves, sharp and final. The air in the room thickened, growing heavy with a strange, focused intent, like a courtroom holding its breath before a verdict is read. He stood, the chair scraping a raw sound against the floorboards, and crossed to the door. Peephole first. The hallway stretched out, an exercise in mundane normality‚Äîfrayed burgundy carpet, dim bulbs in sconces that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in a decade, a faded print of a lighthouse. But the red EXIT sign at the far end glowed with an unnatural intensity, flickering like a distressed signal from a place beyond naming. He turned the deadbolt. The click echoed in the stifling silence, too loud, too final.

An envelope lay on the floor just outside, manila, unmarked, and heavy with a tangible weight, like a slab of guilt. It hadn't been there a minute ago. He tore it open, the paper resisting with a faint, fibrous tear. Inside, a single sheet, the crispness of officialdom, the text in a severe black serif font that was cold and impersonal as a legal verdict: *Continuity Bureau ‚Äî Office of Draft Integrity. Case LQ-11, BRENNAN, P. Your life fails coherence standards. Correct or face liquidation. Acknowledge to proceed.* He tilted the page. A spiral watermark ghosted across it, visible only in the angled light from the hallway, its curves impossibly precise, a proto-glyph that seemed to pulse with a low-level intent, as if the paper itself was a living, watching thing.

*Liquidation.* The word didn't just land; it sank into him, a blade sliding between his ribs and into the core of him. This wasn't a critique of his writing. This was an indictment of *him*‚Äîhis choices, his failures, his very existence. The Bureau wasn't an editor; they were a celestial censor, intent on erasing the messy, flawed text of Philip Brennan and rewriting it into something clean, compliant, and soulless. His pulse hammered, a frantic drum against his ribs. He saw Britt then, clear as day, standing under the sodium glow of a streetlight, rain misting in her hair. Her eyes were hard, her voice a low cut: *You don't live a life, Phil. You let the story write you.* He saw Devon, seventeen years old and radiating a trust that felt like a physical weight, sitting in a caf√© booth, a notebook open, waiting for the pages Phil had promised and never produced. He had failed them both, spectacularly, but he was still here, a flawed character refusing to be written out. He wasn't about to let some divine, faceless bureaucracy choose his ending.

He grabbed a pen from the desk, a cheap ballpoint, and scrawled directly over the Bureau's pristine text: *I‚Äôm Phil Brennan. I decide my story.* The cheap ink bled, smearing defiantly across the formal type. He tore the letter into ragged strips, the sound satisfyingly violent, and stuffed them into his jeans pocket, a small, tangible rebellion. The ambient hum in the walls sharpened in response, deepening into a low growl, alive and disapproving. He ignored it, his focus turning to the door itself. The brass plaque, screwed into the wood, read 3E. A cold certainty settled in his gut. It had been 3B for three years. It was etched in his lease, in his memory, in the muscle memory of his hand finding the keyhole. He touched one of the screw heads‚Äîit was smooth, synthetic, cold as a lie. He went to the kitchen, yanked open a drawer, and pulled out a screwdriver, its handle worn smooth from years of disuse. He jammed the tip under the edge of the plaque. The screws resisted for a moment, then gave with two reluctant, metallic pops. The plaque clattered to the floor. Beneath it, carved directly into the wood of the door, was a spiral. It was faint, but it pulsed with a soft, rhythmic light, a glyph that seemed to breathe, to watch him.

The laptop chimed again, a single, clear bell struck by an unseen hand. He opened it, his heart a frantic bird against his ribs. New text glowed on the screen: *Vandalism noted. Soft audit initiated. Describe your narrative or escalate to termination.* Phil‚Äôs jaw tightened, a muscle twitching. His fingers flew over the keys, typing not out of fear, but from a well of anger he thought had long since dried up. *I‚Äôm a writer who failed. I hurt Britt, I disappointed Devon, I lied to myself. But I‚Äôm still here, and you don‚Äôt own me.*

The screen froze, the cursor halting mid-blink. The radiator groaned, a long, slow exhale, as if the apartment itself was a living entity expressing its profound disapproval. His phone buzzed on the desk, the screen flashing with a name he hadn't seen in over a year: *Eloise D.* An old friend from a long-defunct writing workshop, her name a sudden, unexpected lifeline. The message was stark: *They flagged you. Get out now.* He dialed her number, his fingers trembling slightly against the cool glass of the screen. One ring. Two. Then her voice, urgent, warm, a crack of humanity in the surreal nightmare.

‚ÄúPhil, are you safe?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, and was surprised by the steadiness in his own voice, the anger giving it a solid core. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre changing things. The door‚Äôs 3E, not 3B. My laptop‚Äôs typing itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Continuity Bureau,‚Äù Eloise said, the words coming in a fast, sharp rush. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt edit manuscripts, Phil. They audit lives. They rewrite them to fit a grand, divine narrative. Liquidation‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just death. It‚Äôs erasure. Body, soul, memory. All of it. You‚Äôre a glitch in their system, and they want to delete you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do I stop them?‚Äù His voice was a blade now, honed sharp by a fear that had been forged into fire.

‚ÄúYou have to write something they can‚Äôt control,‚Äù she said, her voice dropping, becoming more intense. ‚ÄúA third outcome. Not exile, not termination. You have to break their rules, Phil. Create a crack in their system. Something that echoes beyond their drafts, a truth that glitches the whole archive.‚Äù

The line erupted in a burst of static, a sound like frying electronics, but layered beneath it was a high-pitched whine that felt spiritual, like the sound of a circuit connecting to a non-physical realm. A flat, synthesized voice cut through the noise: *Phil Brennan, cease unauthorized contact.* The call died. His phone screen went blank‚Äîno record of the call, no trace of Eloise‚Äôs message, just a default wallpaper and a clock ticking forward, utterly indifferent.

The laptop chimed, the sound now familiar and sinister. *Reviewer 03F assigned. Do not leave the apartment.* Phil let out a laugh, a short, jagged sound that cut the oppressive silence. ‚ÄúTry and stop me.‚Äù He grabbed his worn jacket from the back of a chair, shrugged it on, and moved to the door, yanking it open.

There was no hallway. Where the familiar, shabby corridor should have been was a blank, white wall. At its center, etched into the plaster, was a spiral, identical to the one on his door. It pulsed faintly, a heartbeat in reverse, a glyph of pure, unblinking surveillance. A cold fury rose in him. He didn't hesitate. He raised the screwdriver and stabbed it into the center of the spiral, putting the weight of his body behind it, carving a deep, savage X through the symbol. Plaster chipped and dust rained down like fine ash. The hum in the walls faltered, stuttered, then surged back with a vengeance, the vibration settling unpleasantly in his teeth, a clear warning from the Bureau‚Äôs unseen hand.

He slammed the door shut, the sound a gunshot in the quiet room. He turned, leaning back against the wood, his breath coming in short gasps. His eyes scanned the room, looking for the next change, the next violation. The coffee mug was gone from the desk. He found it on the windowsill. And it was full. Steam curled from its rim, defying the winter chill that seeped through the glass. In the condensation on the cold ceramic, a spiral had traced itself, deliberate, unyielding, a mark of divine surveillance. Phil saw Britt again, her hair a dark wave against the orange glow of a streetlight, carefully spooning a lemon seed from his water glass. *It‚Äôs a kindness,* she‚Äôd said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. *You‚Äôre not a writer, Phil. You‚Äôre a draft that someone else keeps revising.* He‚Äôd promised her, then and there, that he would change, that he would write, that he would show up. He hadn't. But he would be damned if he let the Bureau finish the story she had prophesied.

He crossed the room in three long strides, snatched the mug from the sill, and hurled it against the wall opposite. It shattered with a profoundly satisfying crash, ceramic shards scattering across the floorboards, the steam rising like a defiant ghost in the cold air. The radiator let out a pained, metallic groan, the sound of a wounded machine.

The laptop screen flashed, the light strobing. *Destruction of property increases narrative friction. State one truth about your life.*

Phil sat down at the desk again, not in obedience, but to fight on the only battlefield they had given him. He saw Devon‚Äôs face, so bright, so trusting, sitting in that caf√© booth, his own notebook open. *Show me what you‚Äôve got, Phil. I know it‚Äôs good.* Phil had meant to be honest, to come clean and admit he had nothing, that the well was dry. But when the day came, a profound, leaden fear had settled in his limbs. He‚Äôd stayed home, let the clock run out on their meeting time, and let his silence do the lying for him. He typed, the keys clacking with finality: *I loved Britt and I loved Devon and I failed them both. I hid from my shame instead of facing it.*

The cursor blinked once, twice. *Accepted. State what you suspect but cannot prove.*

‚ÄúThat you‚Äôre not real,‚Äù he typed, his fingers steady now, his heart a single, determined drumbeat. ‚ÄúAnd I can break you.‚Äù

The screen went perfectly still. Then, new text appeared. *Resistance noted. Field Reviewer 03F arriving.*

There was no sound of a door, no footstep. A man was simply there, standing beside the floor lamp, as if the room had exhaled him into being. He wore a gray suit of a nondescript cut, gray shoes, his face smooth and ageless, a sketch of a human that had been left half-finished, too symmetrical and perfect to be real flesh. ‚ÄúPhil Brennan,‚Äù the man said. His voice was flat, precise, devoid of inflection, the voice of a divine clerk. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 03F. Let‚Äôs keep this civil.‚Äù

Phil stood, the screwdriver still gripped tightly in his hand, its solid weight a comfort. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to erase me. That‚Äôs not civil.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are aligning you,‚Äù 03F said, taking a step forward. His feet made no sound, and Phil realized with a start that they didn‚Äôt quite touch the floor; he floated a mere inch above the scratched wood, gravity a mere suggestion he chose to ignore. ‚ÄúYour narrative is incoherent. Loose ends‚Äîfailed promises, unwritten pages, broken bonds. We offer structure. Coherence. Continuity.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your structure.‚Äù Phil pointed the screwdriver at the figure, his voice hard. ‚ÄúGet out of my home.‚Äù

03F‚Äôs eyes, a pale, watery blue, flickered for a microsecond, a glitch in the impassive mask, a flash of something almost human. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt evict continuity. But you can shape it. Write one truth. No lies. About why you avoided your neighbors‚Äô party tonight.‚Äù

Phil‚Äôs mind flashed to the party behind the wall‚Äîthe string lights, the shelves of books read for love and not for critique, the easy laughter that didn't need his permission to exist. He‚Äôd gone for five minutes, stood by their bookshelf with a fake smile plastered on his face, and fled the moment the dancing started, terrified someone would ask *the question* and see the truth in his eyes. He turned to the laptop and typed: *I didn‚Äôt go because I‚Äôm ashamed that I haven‚Äôt written anything worth sharing in over a year. I am so tired of lying about it.*

The screen flashed a soft green. *Accepted. Friction reduced.* 03F gave a single, shallow nod, a judge approving a plea bargain. ‚ÄúGood. Acknowledgment is the first step toward coherence. Now, describe the last significant time you changed your mind.‚Äù

Phil closed his eyes. The memory was a fresh wound. Devon‚Äôs face, clear and sharp‚Äîseventeen, all grin and hopeful eyes, waiting at that caf√© for the pages that would never come. *I know it‚Äôs good.* Phil had rehearsed the honest admission in the mirror: *I have nothing to show you.* But when the moment of truth arrived, he had chosen the coward‚Äôs path, the silent lie. He opened his eyes, his voice raw. ‚ÄúI promised my nephew, Devon, I‚Äôd show him my work. I meant to tell him I had nothing, that I was a fraud. But when the day came, I lied by not showing up at all. I‚Äôm done with that. I‚Äôm done lying.‚Äù

‚ÄúAccepted,‚Äù 03F said, his tone unchanged. The screen updated: *Pattern: avoidance. Opportunity: correction.*

Phil leaned forward, the screwdriver feeling like an extension of his own rage. ‚ÄúI am not your ‚Äòopportunity.‚Äô Tell me how to end this audit. For good.‚Äù

03F‚Äôs physical outline seemed to blur for a moment, like static on a poorly tuned television, a disruption in the divine circuit holding him together. ‚ÄúThe system requires a resolution. Write a third outcome. Not exile. Not termination. Something we can‚Äôt predict. A truth that glitches the archive.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù Phil demanded, his voice rising, the room itself seeming to lean in to listen.

‚ÄúFind it,‚Äù 03F said, and as he spoke, he began to fade, not vanishing, but dissolving into the wall behind him, his form becoming translucent, then transparent, his voice the last thing to go, lingering in the air like the smell of ozone after a lightning strike. ‚ÄúOr we will.‚Äù

The laptop chimed, a softer note this time. *Seal active. Do not leave the premises.* Phil ignored it. He grabbed a black permanent marker from the desk drawer and strode to the wall where 03F had vanished. In large, capital letters, he scrawled: *I AM NOT YOUR DRAFT.* The ink was thick and wet, but as he watched, it began to bleed, the letters blurring and running into each other, spontaneously forming a perfect spiral before the entire mark faded into the paint, as if the wall itself had absorbed and rejected his claim. The omnipresent hum softened for a moment, wavered with a note of uncertainty, a machine doubting its own core programming.

He moved to the kitchen, a new target for his defiance. He yanked open the refrigerator door. Inside, everything was meticulously aligned‚Äîjars with labels facing forward, cartons neatly stacked, a stage set for inspection. A single white carton, unmarked except for a small, typed label, sat alone on the middle shelf: *ECP / 1.0 / MIC. For Continuity Testing Only.* He tore it open. Inside was a clear, viscous liquid. He poured it into the sink. It smelled sharp and acrid, like the Zelectronics circuits of some advanced spiritual tech frying out‚Äîthe scent of divine machinery. The faucet hissed, though no water came out, just the sound of it, a hollow mimicry of a normal world.

The laptop screen glowed anew. *Destruction of Bureau evidence noted. Prepare for increased narrative friction.* A new document auto-opened, titled *Bureau Directive 47-C: Subject LQ-11 Compliance Log.* It listed his actions in cold, clinical detail: *21:47 - Door plaque vandalism. 22:03 - Mug destruction. 22:15 - Unauthorized contact (D., Eloise).* Each entry was time-stamped and accompanied by a small, animated spiral glyph.

Phil crossed back to the window, needing to see the outside world, no matter how warped it had become. Below, the alley was dark and empty, except for the scattered remains of the mug. But the shards were not randomly strewn. They had been arranged into a large, perfect spiral on the wet asphalt, and from its center, a thin wisp of steam still curled defiantly upward into the winter night. He turned his back on it, facing the door again, the screwdriver in one hand, the marker in the other. The spiral carved into the wood pulsed with a slow, rhythmic light, a surveillance glyph watching his every move. He set the marker down, gripped the screwdriver with both hands, and carved another X, right over the first one, digging deeper, the wood splintering and groaning in protest. The hum in the walls stuttered violently, like a heart skipping a beat, before resuming its steady, ominous drone.

From the hallway, a single, heavy footstep. Then another. Slow, measured, heavy with purpose. The doorknob began to turn, a fraction of an inch, then stopped.

Phil gripped the screwdriver, his knuckles white, his heart a single, solid drumbeat in his chest. ‚ÄúCome on, then,‚Äù he said, his voice low, steady, a challenge thrown into the silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not done writing yet.‚Äù

He yanked the door open.

The hallway was back. But it was not his hallway. The frayed burgundy carpet was gone, replaced by a deep maroon velvet that looked new and untouched. The faded lighthouse print was missing; in its place hung a large, framed photograph of a spiral carved into a cornfield, the stalks bent into a pattern that could only be seen from above, a divine decree shot from the heavens. He stepped out, the screwdriver held ready, the pen tucked into his pocket like a secondary weapon. The hum followed him out, but it was softer now, almost respectful, as if the very fabric of the building was acknowledging his defiance, if not yet accepting it.

From behind the door of 3D, the neighbors‚Äô laughter started up again, fragile, beautifully human, a thread of real life he had been avoiding for far too long. Phil moved forward, each step a conscious choice, each choice a potential cost. The spiral on his door watched, but he was no longer its page. He was Phil Brennan, flawed, unfinished, a narrative mess, but he was fighting. The Bureau could rewrite his apartment, his door, his hallway‚Äîbut they would not rewrite *him*. Not without a fight.

The door to 3E clicked shut behind him. The hum paused, as if listening. Somewhere beyond the walls, a glass clinked, a genuine laugh broke free, and the story‚Äîhis story‚Äîcracked open, a fault line in the Bureau‚Äôs perfect, sterile script.",1,1761763989.0,writers,1,1.0,False

But the final draw was the fact that I can't go to university, I have to commute about 1:20 hr to university and concerta makes me so tired and my body so heavy and I have this deep sort of anxiety + heaviness that I skip it so often , and I also have trouble sleeping , partially because of not eating right 

So my doctor prescribed me xanax to help with this issue but while it helps short term, it has come to a point where my tolerance has grown so much (I now need 1-2mg to sleep from it) that it has started giving me severe side effects, like forgetting entire days, being nauseaus , being too tired to go to uni even after waking up, sleeping 16 hours etc. 

Plus, the next 1-2 days after taking xanax, if I take concerta I have high heart rate + anxiety. 

So it's a vicious cycle where concerta makes me need xanax, xanax makes my symptoms worrse and so on. 

So, after talking with chatgpt for a while I decided that I should take a break for about a month. I've taken breaks before and everytime , once I restarded concerta it was much better than previously. 

I must mention that I'm a recovering addict from marijuana, and I've read the scripts on the medications and it's said that every time you take or have taken sedatives , it will make the side effects of the stimulant worse, and so it makes sense that I have all these side effects from concerta. Even coffee makes me feel bad, because I smoked for about 6 years heavily, and it's only been 11 months since I quit. It's supposed to last another 1-5 months until I fully heal.

On the other hand, my psychiatrist prescribed me wellbutrin so I'm gonna keep taking that, maybe it will help me with my main issue which is initiation and motivation. I've never had issues with memory or even with focus from my adhd, it was always mainly motivation, energy, sleep etc. 

So my plan now is that during this break, I will try to get myself back into the gym 3x a week no matter what, form some new habbits, adjust to wellbutrin and then restart maybe at 36mg for a week and then back to 54mg. I have about 2 bottles of 36mg and 2 more of 54mg stocked up because I skip it so often haha.

1ojcseo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojcseo,Day 22: Pumpkin Samosas,"Very similar to empanadas, but with curry powder! Many cultures have their own forms of basically dough stuffed with some kind of filling, different shapes of course. My samosas came out looking more like blobs lol I need to practice my samosa shapes but they tasted amazing, I had these for breakfast with a cup of coffee. They're fantastic for breakfast. I also used wheat flour since that's what I had on hand, so mine are a bit darker in color and a bit harder to shape than all-purpose flour.

The original recipe is from Vegan Lovlie: 
https://veganlovlie.com/vegan-pumpkin-samosas-recipe/ There are great photos of the process and a helpful discussion of different options for making the dough, depending if you want to bake or fry your samosas. I added a lot more curry powder than the original recipe, but you decide how spicy you want these!

**Ingredients**

Dough:
* 3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 cup plant milk or Earth Balance
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon salt
* water as needed to form the dough

Filling:
* 2 cups diced potatoes
* 1 cup pumpkin puree
* 1 tablespoon powdered ginger
* 1 tablespoon curry powder
* 1 teaapoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* fresh herbs such as thyme or coriander (skip if not available)
* 1 small tomato, about 1 cup diced
* salt and pepper to taste

**1. Start by making the filling.** Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced potatoes and toss to coat with oil. Cover and cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes, until they are cooked through.
2. When the potatoes are cooked through, add your pumpkin puree, spices, salt and pepper and stir to combine and roughly mash the potatoes. I used a potato masher but you can use a spoon, mash to your desired consistency.
3. Cook for a few more minutes with the spices, then remove from heat. Add the tomato chunks and fresh herbs if using, mash again to combine then set aside to cool while you make the dough.
**4. Then make the dough:** mix flour and salt in a bowl, and add plant milk or Earth Balance. Mix until crumbly. Add the ACV, and add cold water by tablespoons until the dough pulls together. Knead gently a few times until combined. This is a bit of an art, if your dough is too sticky, add a bit of flour, if it's too wet add a little more water, etc.
5. When you're ready to make samosas, divide your dough ball into three equal portions. Divide each 1/3 into 6 portions. Roll out your 6 dough portions with a rolling pin to circles about 2-3mm thick, and cut in half.
6. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of filling onto each half. Lightly wet the edge with a little cold water on your finger tip, and fold over the straight cut half. Pinch together the edges so they're completely sealed. Twist the edge to make them look pretty, if you're better than me at samosas! lol more details on shaping them at the blog link.
7. Bake at 350F for 20 minutes, or fry in oil. Let cool before enjoying. You can also freeze them for up to a month.

I feel conflicted because this man is my father, yet he‚Äôs also responsible for many of the internal issues I still carry.

Growing up, my parents didn‚Äôt give me much guidance or emotional support. Our home was filled with trauma. My dad repeatedly cheated on my mom, and after returning from deployment in Iraq, he became violent. I remember him throwing a coffee cup at her so hard she needed staples in her head. I saw bruises on her arms and legs more times than I can count. He also hit me and my brother, sometimes in public, slapping us in front of others. One night, when I was a young teenager, he came home drunk, pointed a loaded gun at us, and screamed until we were on our knees begging him to stop. My brother also may have a learning disability since he was held back a grade twice during his education. My memory is of my dad slamming text books into his head because he struggled. He has punched and kicked me over the most minor things such as me being shy and struggling to ask an employee where art supplies were at in Walmart. Somehow, maybe because I was mentally blocking it out, I thought this kind of behavior was normal until I spent time with my fianc√©e‚Äôs family and realized it wasn‚Äôt.

Despite everything, I joined the Marines, built a career in corporate finance, and recently got into a highly ranked MBA program. I volunteer regularly with organizations that help the homeless, hospice patients, and animal shelters. My parents gave me little direction along the way, but now my dad likes to claim that my success is because of his parenting. He‚Äôs said, ‚ÄúYou guys are good sons because I beat you growing up.‚Äù They‚Äôve never attended any of my graduations, military or academic, and have said they may or may not come to my wedding. They‚Äôve never really shown pride in anything I‚Äôve done.

For more than ten years now, my dad has claimed to work in another city since retiring from the military. He comes home to my mom a couple of times a week, but none of us have ever seen where he stays or works. He says his company pays for his lodging, but when I looked into his background, I found multiple arrests since his retirement for things like money laundering, illegal gambling, DUIs, and possession of an illegal firearm. He was even charged with assault on a family member two years ago in the same city where my mom lives. The complainant was a woman, so I assume he‚Äôs been living a double life with someone else.

He‚Äôs also in deep credit card debt and has borrowed tens of thousands of dollars from my brother, supposedly to help a friend with a medical emergency. Neither of us has ever met this person.

My dad doesn‚Äôt support my upcoming marriage. I assume it‚Äôs because my fianc√©e isn‚Äôt our ‚Äútype of Asian.‚Äù We‚Äôre East Asian, and she‚Äôs Southeast Asian. He‚Äôs made almost no effort to connect with her or her parents, even though they‚Äôve treated me like their own son. They celebrate everything with me, feed me, and have been nothing but supportive of my career and dreams. My dad has talked down to me and my brother in front of her and said I shouldn‚Äôt expect him to contribute to wedding costs, which he considers ‚Äúextravagant,‚Äù even though he borrows money from my brother and donates to political causes every month.

Throughout my life, his advice has been terrible. When I was getting out of the Marines, he told me not to apply for VA disability because it would hurt my career. I ignored him, and it took me three years to finally get compensation for my injuries. More recently, when my fianc√©e and I decided to buy a home together, he told me I was dumb for wanting a nice house and said I needed his approval before buying one. We went ahead and bought the home without telling them. Whenever I ask for advice, he just cuts me off with ‚ÄúListen to me! I know more than you!‚Äù

During my last visit home, I asked to talk privately and told him I wanted a better relationship based on mutual respect. I told him I‚Äôve worked hard, lived honestly, and even send money every month to help my mom with my grandparents‚Äô medical costs. He told me, ‚ÄúIn our culture, I don‚Äôt owe you respect. Respect only goes up, never down.‚Äù The argument escalated, and he kicked me out of the house at one in the morning, forcing me to drive three hours back home that night.

My mom doesn‚Äôt know about his criminal record, and she‚Äôs threatened to cut me off if I don‚Äôt apologize to him. My brother knows everything, and thankfully, we‚Äôve grown closer over the past few months. Still, I feel torn. Part of me feels guilty because he‚Äôs getting older and probably doesn‚Äôt have more than ten or fifteen years left. But another part of me feels drained and unsure of how much more I can take.

Lately, I‚Äôve been struggling with my sense of identity. I‚Äôve spent so much of my life trying to earn acceptance from my parents, but now that I know I‚Äôll probably never get it, I‚Äôm not sure what I want for myself anymore.

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm in my 30s and just realized how dysfunctional my family is after spending time with my fianc√©e‚Äôs loving, supportive family. My dad was abusive growing up ‚Äî he cheated on my mom, hit her (sometimes severely), hit me and my brother in public, and even once pointed a loaded gun at us while drunk. I used to think that was normal.

Despite everything, I built a successful life (Marine Corps vet, career in corporate finance, got into a top MBA program, and volunteer often), but my parents take zero credit for that. My dad insists he ‚Äúraised us right by beating us‚Äù and has never shown pride in anything I‚Äôve done.

He‚Äôs been ‚Äúworking‚Äù in another city for 10+ years, but I found out he‚Äôs been arrested multiple times for things like money laundering, gambling, DUIs, and assault. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs living a double life with another woman. He‚Äôs in debt, borrows money from my brother for sketchy reasons, and refuses to support my wedding because my fianc√©e is a different ‚Äútype‚Äù of Asian.

He gives terrible advice, tries to control my life decisions, and told me he doesn‚Äôt owe me respect because ‚Äúrespect only goes up.‚Äù When I tried to talk to him about it, he kicked me out at 1 a.m. My mom defends him and says I should apologize.

I feel guilty because he‚Äôs getting older, but I‚Äôm also angry, confused, and tired. For the first time, I‚Äôm realizing I might never get the acceptance I‚Äôve always wanted from him ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt know how to move forward or what I even want anymore.",2,1761763215.0,AsianParentStories,1,1.0,False

During middle school, my weight fluctuated a lot and it bothered me a lot. I started drinking way more coffee than is healthy to suppress my appetite and was barely eating. After moving around a lot I‚Äôd switch from hardly eating at all to binging and then taking laxatives to purge afterwards.

**The reality:**

Every day, thousands of people search for local services on Google. ""Accountant near me."" ""Best restaurant in Sandton."" ""Plumber in Cape Town.""

If your Google Business Profile isn't optimized, those searches go straight to your competitors.

**What I see constantly:**

* Profiles with 2-3 photos (or worse, stock images)
* Blank business descriptions
* Wrong category selected
* No posts in 6+ months
* Reviews completely ignored
* Inconsistent business info across platforms

**What happens when you optimize:**

I helped a client (coffee shop in Sandton) properly set up their Google Business Profile. Added photos, wrote a keyword-rich description, started posting weekly, set up a review system.

**Results in 3 weeks:**

* Direction requests: +67%
* Phone calls: +40%
* Started ranking in top 3 for ""coffee shop Sandton""
* Cost: R0

**The 90-minute process:**

1. Claim your profile and verify it
2. Fill out every field (no blanks)
3. Upload 10+ real photos
4. Choose the most specific category
5. Write a description with your keywords
6. Add your service areas
7. Enable messaging
8. Create your first post

**Critical mistake to avoid:**

Make sure your business Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) are identical everywhere online. Even ""St"" vs ""Street"" confuses Google and tanks your rankings.

He was even charged with assault on a family member two years ago in the same city where my mom lives. The complainant was a woman, so I assume he‚Äôs been living a double life with someone else.

He‚Äôs also in deep credit card debt and has borrowed tens of thousands of dollars from my brother, supposedly to help a friend with a medical emergency. Neither of us has ever met this person.

My dad doesn‚Äôt support my upcoming marriage. I assume it‚Äôs because my fianc√©e isn‚Äôt our ‚Äútype of Asian.‚Äù We‚Äôre East Asian, and she‚Äôs Southeast Asian. He‚Äôs made almost no effort to connect with her or her parents, even though they‚Äôve treated me like their own son. They celebrate everything with me, feed me, and have been nothing but supportive of my career and dreams. My dad has talked down to me and my brother in front of her and said I shouldn‚Äôt expect him to contribute to wedding costs, which he considers ‚Äúextravagant,‚Äù even though he borrows money from my brother and donates to Donald Trump every month.

Throughout my life, his advice has been terrible. When I was getting out of the Marines, he told me not to apply for VA disability because it would hurt my career. I ignored him, and it took me three years to finally get compensation for my injuries. More recently, when my fianc√©e and I decided to buy a home together, he told me I was dumb for wanting a nice house and said I needed his approval before buying one. We went ahead and bought the home without telling them. Whenever I ask for advice, he just cuts me off with ‚ÄúListen to me! I know more than you!‚Äù

During my last visit home, I asked to talk privately and told him I wanted a better relationship based on mutual respect. I told him I‚Äôve worked hard, lived honestly, and even send money every month to help my mom with my grandparents‚Äô medical costs. He told me, ‚ÄúIn our culture, I don‚Äôt owe you respect. Respect only goes up, never down.‚Äù The argument escalated, and he kicked me out of the house at one in the morning, forcing me to drive three hours back home that night.

My mom doesn‚Äôt know about his criminal record, and she‚Äôs threatened to cut me off if I don‚Äôt apologize to him. My brother knows everything, and thankfully, we‚Äôve grown closer over the past few months. Still, I feel torn. Part of me feels guilty because he‚Äôs getting older and probably doesn‚Äôt have more than ten or fifteen years left. But another part of me feels drained and unsure of how much more I can take.

Lately, I‚Äôve been struggling with my sense of identity. I‚Äôve spent so much of my life trying to earn acceptance from my parents, but now that I know I‚Äôll probably never get it, I‚Äôm not sure what I want for myself anymore.

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm in my 30s and just realized how dysfunctional my family is after spending time with my fianc√©e‚Äôs loving, supportive family. My dad was abusive growing up ‚Äî he cheated on my mom, hit her (sometimes severely), hit me and my brother in public, and even once pointed a loaded gun at us while drunk. I used to think that was normal.

Despite everything, I built a successful life (Marine Corps vet, career in corporate finance, got into a top MBA program, and volunteer often), but my parents take zero credit for that. My dad insists he ‚Äúraised us right by beating us‚Äù and has never shown pride in anything I‚Äôve done.

He‚Äôs been ‚Äúworking‚Äù in another city for 10+ years, but I found out he‚Äôs been arrested multiple times for things like money laundering, gambling, DUIs, and assault. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs living a double life with another woman. He‚Äôs in debt, borrows money from my brother for sketchy reasons, and refuses to support my wedding because my fianc√©e is a different ‚Äútype‚Äù of Asian.

He gives terrible advice, tries to control my life decisions, and told me he doesn‚Äôt owe me respect because ‚Äúrespect only goes up.‚Äù When I tried to talk to him about it, he kicked me out at 1 a.m. My mom defends him and says I should apologize.

I feel guilty because he‚Äôs getting older, but I‚Äôm also angry, confused, and tired. For the first time, I‚Äôm realizing I might never get the acceptance I‚Äôve always wanted from him ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt know how to move forward or what I even want anymore.",1,1761763154.0,family,3,1.0,False
1ojcr4k,https://i.redd.it/xrvknjkwh3yf1.png,"Help with spectrograms - stalker breaking into home, police inaction (detail included)","EDIT: I wrote this offline and am seeing now that this subreddit doesn't allow galleries so I've just included one spectrogram; I'm going to see if I can add more in the comments or not.

Hi, I'm asking for help with analyzing some audio or interpreting some spectrograms I made using Python; I have no familiarity with this area and ended up using Python because I couldn't figure out how to automate making the spectrograms with Sonic Visualiser; I did check that the graphs I created are basically exactly the same as the output from Sonic Visualiser and this post will have examples from both, as Sonic Visualiser's ability to zoom/etc was a huge plus, but the constant buffering for huge file sizes was a huge minus.

I know this sounds completely ridiculous and understand that more proof may be needed for it to be accepted/validated; I'm absolutely OK with sending some of the raw audio to a mod or something as additional proof, but am very anxious about just posting it outright. Part of the help I'm looking for, though, would involve getting help with raw audio anyways.

**I have multiple carbon monoxide detectors and they all work.**

Some background because the ask is really weird (I am deliberately leaving out or swapping some details here and there for safety purposes - I'm really sorry if that makes it confusing but I'm not comfortable being super direct right now) - a tech bro who's in his feelings because I hurt his ego has been stalking me for a while, for a while I thought it was all tech-enabled stalking, like getting into texts, emails, etc:

* I have a bunch of screenshots from waking up to a notification that my Apple account had been added to a new device, but by the time I woke up and saw it, only my own devices were still logged in
* I have a screenshot from when I found out that someone signed my phone number up for Signal
* I have several IP addresses that someone repeatedly signed into one of my social media accounts from - it can't be me, I was in a different location and they're not associated with a VPN - just a regular US cell provider - I'm assuming he did this a lot and these are just the times he forgot to use a VPN
* My old cell phone provider confirmed after I missed an important call that someone had set up call forwarding, but couldn't provide any detail on to whom (I have a strong suspicion as to why) - the call never showed up in my call history as a missed call or anything, and for whatever reason, my phone turned off about 30 minutes before the call was scheduled even though it was fully charged and plugged into the wall. I confirmed with the other person that I'd given the correct number and she showed that she'd called twice, but it never seems to have come through on my end at all. I'd just gotten a new phone and started using a completely new Apple ID and didn't migrate anything, so my old texts and call history weren't on the new phone. After this missed call thing, though, I noticed that my old call history from the old Apple ID was suddenly randomly there, including voicemails, etc. I have no idea if this is some sort of weird fluke or what.
* Kept getting signed out of my email within 5 minutes of signing in, including one point where I literally made a screen record for 15 straight minutes where every time I signed in, I'd barely even get to the ""look at your emails"" screen being loaded before I was signed out again, over and over and over
* Emails kept going missing to the point that I started to wonder if I was just thinking I'd sent an email when actually I'd only thought about it - so I started taking screenshots after sending important emails - became useful when an important email chain went completely missing

At a certain point, it became a strong worry that this guy was breaking into my house:

* I'd find random things like a foreign country's currency on the floor in front of my TV stand - the country is on a continent I've never been to (this was about a month after moving into the house, when the only people who'd been there were family members who did visit that country - once, in the 90s - as well as my landlord and his regular handyman, neither of whom have visited that country)
* After going out to dinner one night, when I got back, my dish drying rack was rotated 45 degrees so that it was perfectly lined up at a very weird angle into the sink
* A whole sequence of events where I got into my car and found that an old garage beeper was no longer on the visor. Days later, I found it in the back seat and put it back normally. A few days later, I got into my car and the same beeper was on the visor, but flipped upside down so that the button was towards the roof and the visor couldn't close fully. I flipped it back normally. I started staring at the beeper every time I got out of the car to visually remember exactly how it had been situated on the visor, and had specifically made a mental note before going into a coffee shop that ""the beeper is on the visor and the button is facing down""; when I came out of the coffee shop, the beeper had been slid on the visor and rotated 90 degrees so it was pointed out the passenger side window instead of out the dashboard.

I have reported this to the police and they aren't doing anything. I managed to get the contact information for a sitting US Congressman's Chief of Staff and asked him to call on my behalf and ask if they could please do something about any of this. The important email chain that went completely missing was the email chain where I'd been sending everything over to them (I have since learned that they ""don't open attachments"" because they are ""worried about viruses"" so it sounds like they never actually looked at any of it); I submitted an Open Records request for them to send me everything from that email chain and they also included some internal communications where they're complaining about me and telling the Chief of Staff essentially that it's all in my head; the documents make it very clear that they aren't doing anything and don't intend to. To be fair, there have been points where I've been very confused about who was doing all this - again, sorry, there's a lot I'm leaving out (shockingly).

This part isn't strictly required to understand the ask but I'm including it because I kind of feel like I need to explain the thought process on how exactly I have what I have and why I need help with it - feel free to skip.

* I think I've kind of been in denial about most of that and kept coming up with other explanations even if they really didn't make any sense. I have a security system, though if this guy's been able to get into my iCloud, emails, social media, etc - I don't really know, I've changed all those passwords multiple times and started using a completely new password manager, but that didn't seem to stop him, so I can't imagine it would be difficult for him to get into my security system. I did kind of figure out how he would've theoretically been able to ""bypass"" it without it being visible (I'm not going to say how), and managed to confirm with the company that they do log that data, but require customers to have a police subpoena to obtain it, and the police aren't going to do that.
* For much longer than this, though, I was concerned that whoever it was, was using the fact that they kept managing to get into my email and my iCloud to basically impersonate me. There were a lot of small things here and there and I do think it was kind of in the back of my mind for a long time that some things I was noticing really couldn't be happening unless someone was physically getting into my home, but it took the audio that I'm asking for help with for it to really sink in. I've been doing a lot of weird, paranoid things with the understanding that I'm being ridiculous, but if a small zero-cost crazy thing that takes 3 seconds of my time is going to kind of help me calm myself down at my most anxious if I wake up in the middle of the night and the logic hasn't woken up with me yet, it's worth it. One of those things was I think mostly borne out of a concern that this person was impersonating me, but I'm pretty sure there were a few factors and that was the biggest; if that was happening, I wanted to at least have proof for myself if someone brought something up, so I've been making voice memos when I go to sleep so at least I'll know that if he was doing something insane in my iCloud while I was asleep, I'll be able to know for myself that I was asleep when it happened instead of possibly gaslighting myself or whatever. Then a bunch of weird things started happening, and I listened to a few where I made physical notes in the morning of something weird or out of place. Dude has been...breaking into my house while I am in my house, asleep.
* I work in a tech-adjacent field and am reasonably comfortable working with large quantities of data and basically taking in a bunch of messy data and turning it into something consistent and functional; I set up several launch daemons on my laptop to basically just monitor some stuff in the background and keep track of anything that changes. I don't know much about that sort of thing and so it isn't really a targeted ""specifically monitoring these things"" type of deal, more a ""IDK what most of this means and I'm going to track all of it, look at it every once in a while, and see if anything sticks out"" vibe. Some things have stuck out! One of them being that he seems generally aware of what I'm tracking, because (avoiding details intentionally, sorry) some very specific things related to a specific monitoring job were tampered with in a very specific way. It looks like he may have also found a way to sort of tamper with some of the Voice Memos (I have no idea how, but from everything I'm looking at, it's the only option I can come up with that explains it).

If you skipped - I have recorded voice memos of this guy breaking into my house while I'm asleep in the house. I've had this for months, and reported that to the police as well (""what do you expect us to do with that if there's no video"" - IDK, is ""I have these audio files of a stalker committing multiple B&Es while I'm sleeping"" not enough to get a warrant for info on the IP addresses that this stalker was logging into my accounts from, or info from my old cell phone provider, or the security system on the data that would demonstrate whether someone was getting past the system in a regrettably very smart way - genuinely I don't know, that is a real question). I'm asking for help with analyzing either spectrograms or raw audio to see what can be learned from them and if there's anything I can do to get someone to help or stop this person.

For one voice memo in particular, I listened to it within hours because I woke up with a huge injury on my leg that hadn't been there when I went to sleep. I had an appointment with a service tech coming by the house, and overslept to the point that literally I woke up when he was ringing the doorbell. I felt horrible - both because he was very on time and I was very asleep, and because there was something wrong with what felt like all the muscles in my body. I don't drink alcohol or use any drugs, so none of this can be explained by any of that. I have two security cameras and one of them has video of that leg like 30 minutes before I went to sleep - no injury, great picture, very clear, very zoom-in-able. Uninjured leg. Next morning, 2-inch injury on my leg. Unexplained. If the doorbell hadn't gone off, I would not have woken up. But it did, and I could barely get out of bed. It felt like every single muscle in my body was going to give out at once, or barely had enough power to get up. I felt super nauseated and ended up not being able to eat anything all day. I was thinking super slowly and was generally very disoriented. When I went to brush my teeth and throw on a comfy dress, I had to sit down and take breaks multiple times and was extremely clammy. I was exhausted, and when the guy left about 45 minutes later, I got straight back into bed but did listen to the audio literally right then, I just scrolled to the parts where the noise-level bars went ""up"" and listened to those parts. The whole audio is 8.5 hours before the doorbell; 5 hours in it sounds like someone is smothering me. I fully realize that sounds ridiculous. I make a really loud, startled sound, but it's also muffled. Then it basically sounds like a bunch of pressure is being put on something for about a minute (theory later). Shortly before that, in the background, the sound basically of some sort of container being opened, like the kind with a cork or a rubber stopper, and a few things quietly being put down while I'm in the foreground, breathing, asleep. Then a loud-but-muffled yelp, lots of pressure (I don't know how else to describe it) for about a minute, then it abruptly stops. For reasons related to something I left out, I've been storing old laptops/phones/etc in a lockbox, and had started using YubiKeys as 2FA wherever possible. I didn't want to risk misplacing the lockbox key or YubiKey, so I'd put them on a necklace and usually ended up sleeping with it on. After the abrupt stop, there's an extended period where the necklace is making a bunch of noise. It makes noise when I turn over while sleeping, and I compared the duration to audio of that happening; this goes on for much, much longer. Then it's the sound of covers being ripped back and flipping through my notebook. There are some things I wanted to keep secure that don't fit in the lockbox, so I'd been keeping them in a roll-top buckle bag next-to-below the pillow, like headboard -> pillow -> bag; there's the sound of that being opened and emptied out. I had the backup YubiKey in the lockbox, and have since noticed that it no longer works at all. When I plug it into anything, it doesn't register as anything having been plugged in at all; I use a Mac and have checked by doing lookups in terminal with system\_profiler, etc, and nothing shows anything being plugged in when I plug the backup YubiKey in, but the ports all work fine with anything else. In this one, there are several parts where the noise bar thing that Voice Memos shows will show an increase in sound, but there isn't one that I can hear.

Part of me is hoping that this guy found some sort of way to modify the Voice Memos remotely and make it ""seem"" like he broke in rather than actually doing it, because that whole range of events is ridiculous, and I'm very aware that it sounds kind of unbelievable. I don't really know how I'd end up with a large unexplained leg injury that I have no recollection of getting, though, if there weren't some legitimacy to the bottle stopper noise + shocked yelp + muffled + nothing being some kind of...drugging scenario. I looked some things up and it does seem like there is one particular medical anesthetic that can knock a person out in a minute as an inhalant and also has basically an identical side-effect profile to what I was personally experiencing that day - and, in retrospect, a few other days. I'm 5'3"" and scrawny; if someone were to do that while I were in a dead sleep, I don't think I'd really be much of an adversary. I don't really know why that would be the method someone would choose?

I can't find any part of the audio that would correspond to the leg injury, and I noticed there are some large gaps where something seems like it's been fucked with. I ran all the Voice Memos through a python script that makes a spectograph for each hour of audio (it crashed if I tried to make one for anything much longer), and in that audio, as well as several others, there's some really weird patterns. There's also a bunch where it seems like the 8000-12000 Hz range has been removed or something, because the decibel level is significantly lower than all the surrounding frequencies, and it doesn't happen in all the audios (but when it does happen in one, it usually appears across most or all of that audio's spectrographs). There's also parts where I can't really explain it besides that you can tell something's kind of ""missing"" from the audio, like the sounds are really obvious what they are but there's something about the quality of the sound that's just...wrong. I was reading about how to determine if an audio file has been tampered with and one of the results was if the spectrograph shows a bunch of ""repeated"" sound loops since that's I guess a common way to tamper with audio, and while the python spectrographs aren't zoomed-in enough, I did also take screenshots of several audio files being open in Sonic Visualiser where it looks like that - but to be super clear, I don't know anything about this field and I have no idea if I'm misinterpreting the information. However, I checked several ""good"" Voice Memos where it doesn't seem like anything happened, and none of those have had the repeated-stripe pattern I saw in the other ones.

I listened to 2 more that same day with the leg injury based off of remembering that I'd noticed weird things the morning after making them - feeling exhausted and sick and having to lay down most of the day and how any time I leaned against my pillow, I'd pick up some sort of weird medicinal smell, but if I sat up, I couldn't smell it anymore, or waking up and a bunch of things in my room were in different places than I remember putting them before going to sleep. I was taking screenshots of the most alarming points. In one of them, instead of a surprised yelp, it's like I'm trying to shout 3 different words but never got more than the start of a syllable out. That seems to be completely gone from the Voice Memo. My first assumption was that I'd misremembered it or built it up in my head, but looking at the spectrograms for that audio, there's a bunch of parts where it seems like entire frequency ranges were kind of clouded out and it keeps switching back and forth between having that repeated-stripe pattern and not having the repeated-stripe pattern.

This kind of thing doesn't happen. It feels insane.

Lately a bunch of the Voice Memos have had some sort of weird electronic quality and at points, it kind of sounds like the Voice Memo is trying to connect to dial-up. I don't know what to do with that information. It's even been happening in the ones since I've been staying in hotels.

Would anyone be willing to look at the spectographs and let me know if maybe I'm misinterpreting and they are normal?

* One thing I'm noticing a lot is that many seem to have a relatively lower decibel level in the 8000-12000ish frequency band, and I don't know if there's a way for that to be normal in a ""background noise"" context; it's also a lot more pronounced in some of them than in others.
* Also - it seems like there's probably some kind of way to like...fingerprint specific sounds and find places where that sound happened, but I don't really understand how hard that is or how feasible it would be for a few different things.
* If it's possible to ""turn up"" specific frequencies from specific audio files to bring out some details a bit more.
* Or generally what can be done with any of this, if anyone would be willing to help look at the actual raw audio files.
* I kind of just don't even know where to start with these, and I have so many questions where I know some of them I could figure out on my own, but the sheer volume of questions has me overwhelmed and I end up forgetting one question by the time I've started coming up with the next one.
* I have roughly 200 sets of these and have included a small subset. I think there's a limit on how many photos can be added to a post, so I'm going to add some ""highly relevant"" ones to the actual post, but if I can, I'm also planning on making maybe a comment thread with the full set of spectographs for specific dates, one per comment.

I've included a bunch of spectrographs:

* They're almost entirely either from April-June or October because I wanted to make sure I listened to the audios and verified some things against the spectrographs so I could kind of do a little blurb on a few of the ones I'm including (not all of them - some just have general questions on if certain aspects of the spectrographs are a red flag, normal, or depend on some other factor) and I specifically listened to the October ones after noticing some weird metadata for those ones that seems to correspond with how they sound like they're trying to connect to dial-up, and otherwise I've been going either chronologically or by the ones that were most important. I also threw in a random one in the middle where it seems suspiciously ""smoothed over"".
* Some of them have another date in parentheses - those are basically ones I started after midnight on the parentheses date but wanted to have them all in order based on the day that they were associated with; I had a specific reason for doing this and I can't recall what it was anymore. There were also some days where I didn't do this, and I haven't in a while (just using whatever date it actually is at the moment I start the recording).
* Some have "" 2"" or like "" stopped"", etc - sometimes the audio stopped and I started a new one
* Some have ""\_part1"", ""\_part2"" - for these, the python module I used will only read in audio files up to a certain size, and by the time I came across a file over that limit, I didn't want to change the code so I just manually created new audio files by trimming the original audio files so that the non-last ones ended on an exact hour. The x-axis is seconds since that group, so for these ones - part 2 will have ""0 seconds"" on the x-axis but it's really ""0 seconds plus however many hours were in part 1"" - sorry, it's fairly messy and I just wanted to get these created and done with
* From Sonic Visualiser - this has been super useful but also has a really intense lag - in some cases, the range on the bottom hasn't updated yet (it can take a few minutes depending on file size); also - it always says ""modified"" as soon as I just like...change the view options? The file hasn't been changed - seems to be referring to session options
* The last file is sometimes very short, so things are very distorted - I'm really sorry, I didn't think that one through (sometimes an audio file will be 6 hours and 2 minutes, and there'll be charts for hours 1-6, and then a same-width chart for 2 minutes)

I'm sorry this is so long - I think I'm hoping even if the audio files can't be useful, maybe there's some other detail someone will notice that could be useful that I've overlooked, or someone will know how to get help with any of this. Something escalatory happened about two weeks ago and I'm kind of afraid to be in my house at all; I've been sleeping in hotels since and on one hand, that kind of seems like the only option that's safe, but on the other - I can't afford it much longer and I'm really hoping that I can get anyone at all to help with this before I have to go back.

Some of the details I've left out re: general circumstances include being more or less completely isolated from any previous support system; it's tangentially related in the sense that the factors that drove that happening kind of gave this guy an opening, but he didn't (to my knowledge) actually cause that, though he might have helped it along a bit. Besides that, after realizing how much access he seems to have had to my email, etc, I'm pretty sure at this point that there have been several people I reached out to for help who did actually respond, and it got deleted before I saw it. I'm thinking something more public-facing at least hopefully wouldn't have that possibility - though when I was trying to ask for help interpreting some networking-tech stuff and specific weird stuff on my (now old) laptop on an old account on a few different subreddits, every single post kept getting downvoted within hours and really only had comments telling me that I was crazy and paranoid. I did initially think my questions really were just stupid and I was being paranoid, but at a certain point I got suspicious and started going to profiles, and I noticed that a really bizarre number of comments like this on one of my help posts were made by accounts that were created the same day I made whichever help post - I don't know what to do with that. I don't mean to be dramatic but I'm afraid he's going to kill me and I don't know what to do.",0,1761763145.0,DSP,17,0.4,False

One bedroom and private office available for rent. Half a mile from Central Square, half a mile from Inman square, and .8 miles from Union Square. Plenty of bus routes and bike lanes to take advantage of! Within walking distance of Market Basket and Whole Foods, as well as many of the restaurants Cambridge has to offer. Also within walking distance of Harvard and MIT. Perfect apartment for graduate students and young professionals.

The apartment is on the second floor (stairs only, not handicap accessible) of a quiet, well-managed building. Street parking on a quiet side street. Back patio available for your use and enjoyment. Coin-operated laundry in the basement of the building. Bike storage in the basement of the building as well. Non-smoking building, and no pets allowed (your roommate is allergic to cats). Portable dishwasher in-unit. Rent is split 50/50, but because you rent the smaller room you also have the office as your own private space. Between the office and the bedroom, you have two closets and a wealth of space!

Your roommate: A friendly, queer cis POC man in his mid-30's that recently got his PhD in STEM. He likes running, tinkering with gadgets, taking road trips, and drinking copious amounts of coffee. Bonus points if you like Bread and Puppet, or watching YouTube cooking shows. He's very tidy, very friendly, and looking for someone that feels the same. All genders welcome to apply. He is trans and poly friendly!

Unfortunately my life circumstances changed, and I have to move at the end of December. You would be replacing my name on the lease for the remainder of the lease term on 12/31, and renewing in March for a 12-month lease. You'd be off the September lease cycle, so moving will be a breeze.

I have loved this apartment dearly: it really feels like my home. Maintenance is super responsive. The upstairs and downstairs neighbors are quiet and friendly. I am sad to leave, but hope you will find your new home in Cambridge

There's a possibility I will be fully moved out before 12/31. If that is the case, I'd be happy to coordinate you moving in before 12/31.

You pour your thoughts, your experiences, your vulnerability into it. You hit 'submit,' check back five minutes later, and... nothing.

Just the sound of digital crickets. ü¶ó

It‚Äôs a uniquely frustrating feeling, right? Like you‚Äôre shouting into the void. It can make you question if you even have anything valuable to say.

But here‚Äôs the thing: It‚Äôs usually not about the *quality* of your idea. It‚Äôs about the **connection**. We've been taught to broadcast, but the real magic happens when you learn to be a **magnet**. üß≤

A magnet doesn't shout. It pulls. It attracts. It creates a field that draws things in. The goal isn't just to be seen, but to be felt. To start a conversation that snowballs into a community.

I've been working on this shift myself, moving from ""look at what I made"" to ""what do you think about this?"" It's a small change in words but a massive change in energy.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found actually works:

*   **Lead with a question.** Instead of starting with a statement, start with a genuine question you're wrestling with. It‚Äôs an instant invitation for others to join in.
*   **Share the 'messy middle.'** People don't connect with perfect, finished products. They connect with the struggle, the process, the ""I'm still figuring this out"" moments. That‚Äôs where the real trust is built.
*   **Talk like a human.** Ditch the jargon. Would you say that out loud to a friend over coffee? If not, rewrite it. Authenticity is magnetic.
*   **Give more than you take.** Answer questions. Offer support in the comments of other people‚Äôs posts. Be the community member you wish you had.

Honestly, the biggest block for me wasn't strategy‚Äîit was the emotional hurdle of putting myself out there, fearing judgment or, even worse, indifference. Getting my own head straight and figuring out *why* I wanted to connect was the real first step. It made the rest feel less like a chore and more like an adventure.

Full disclosure, I needed some help structuring that internal work. If you're feeling that same kind of block, where the fear or uncertainty is the real problem, I found **this resource (affiliate link)** incredibly helpful for mapping out my personal goals and building the confidence to act on them.

This isn't just about getting more upvotes. It's about finding your people, building your confidence, and making an impact. It's about turning that silence into a vibrant, supportive conversation. üöÄ

So, let's start one now. What‚Äôs the biggest thing that holds YOU back from sharing your ideas more openly?",1,1761762971.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Spanish is my first language, so I used an LLM to translate this article. Apologies if it reads a bit AI-generated at times. I tried to adapt measurements and context for an American audience.

Among all the memes in spanish, I occasionally write a serious article, and this is one of them. I tried to keep it short but it's impossible.

**TL;DR:**¬†There aren't enough wall outlets for the massive datacenters that future ""AI"" will need. AGI, transformers, and blah blah blah?

Everyone talks about ""the AI race."" Who's going to win. Who has better technology. Who's investing more money. How long until AGI...

But where the hell is the electricity going to come from for all this?

# The Numbers That'll Make You Spit Out Your Coffee

OpenAI (yes, the ChatGPT people) needs roughly one nuclear reactor per StarGate project. And they want several datacenters, not just one.

Wait, don't leave yet. It gets better.

[To put it in perspective: in 2024, data centers consumed 4% of all electricity in the United States. By 2030, that number will more than double.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/24/what-we-know-about-energy-use-at-us-data-centers-amid-the-ai-boom/)

Currently, there are about 6 ""confirmed"" Stargate data center sites, with one already partially operational in Abilene, Texas (Stargate I), where the first Nvidia GB200 racks were delivered in June 2025.

The 5 newly announced sites are located in:

* Shackelford County, Texas
* Do√±a Ana County, New Mexico
* Lordstown, Ohio (construction already started)
* Milam County, Texas
* An additional site in the Midwest (yet to be announced)

# The American Problem: Trying to Fly Without Wings

Now comes the fun part: where are they going to get all that energy?

# Nuclear Option: The Solution That Takes 10-15 Years

If you're lucky. And if lawyers don't stop you. And if you pass regulations. And if the local community doesn't oppose it (they always oppose it).

By the time you have the reactor ready, the race is already over.

# Renewables Option: When the Wind Doesn't Blow on Demand

Renewables are nice, green, politically correct. The problem is they're not constant.

The sun doesn't shine at night. Wind blows when it wants to. Data centers need energy now, not ""when there's good weather.""

So you need backup. Giant batteries. Double the panels. Or gas plants. Or all of the above.

# Gas Option: What They're Actually Doing (And It's a Disaster)

What's happening in Memphis? They're reactivating natural gas plants (yes, the ones that pollute) just to power AI data centers.

It's quick to build. It works. Problem solved, right?

And the irony is delicious: they're burning fossil fuels to train AI models that are supposedly going to help us solve climate change.

It's like setting your house on fire to warm yourself. Technically it works, but maybe you didn't think through the consequences.

# The Real Cost: The Average American's Electric Bill

All this energy demand isn't free. Someone has to pay. Guess who? Socialize the losses, privatize the profits.

In the PJM electricity market (which goes from Illinois to North Carolina), data centers caused a price increase of $9.3 billion in 2025-26.

Result:

* \+$18/month on the average Maryland bill
* \+$16/month in Ohio

And that's just the beginning.

A Carnegie Mellon study estimates that by 2030, data centers and crypto mining could increase the average US electricity bill by 8%. In some markets, more than 25%.

# The Situation Today

So you can see this isn't distant future:

* 2014: Average US household paid $114/month for electricity
* 2024: $142/month

A 25% increase in one decade.

And AI demand is just getting started.

# Jevons Paradox: When Efficiency = More Consumption

Here comes a concept tech optimists don't want to see: Jevons Paradox.

It's simple: when you make something more efficient and cheaper, people use it more, not less. Total consumption increases.

It happened with steam engines in the 19th century (better efficiency = more coal consumption). It happened with cars (more efficient engines = more cars = more fuel).

It's going to happen with AI.

The optimistic argument is: ""Don't worry, when AI becomes more efficient, it'll consume less energy.""

False.

When AI becomes more efficient, it'll be cheaper. When it's cheaper, everyone will use it for everything. And total consumption will explode even more.

It's like saying ""when cars consume less gas, there'll be less traffic."" No, dude. There'll be more traffic because more people can afford cars.

Even in the optimistic scenario where they manage to make AI more efficient... they still need those nuclear reactors.

# China: While Others Debate, They Build

What's China doing while the United States debates nuclear vs renewables vs gas?

They simply build. Everything. All at once.

The numbers are obscene:

* 55 nuclear reactors operating
* 21 more under construction
* They build a reactor in 5-7 years (less than half the time it takes the US)
* World leaders in solar, wind, batteries, hydro
* Dominate 90% of the solar panel supply chain
* Produce 70% of the world's batteries

Their logic is pragmatic to the point of ridiculous: Does it work? Does it give energy? We build it. End of story.

# The Contrast

**United States:**

* Ideological debate about nuclear energy (is it safe? is it green?)
* Approval process (slow as Latin American bureaucracy)
* NIMBY (Not In My Backyard): everyone wants energy, nobody wants a plant nearby
* Result: energy paralysis while demand explodes

**China:**

* ""We need energy for our industrial revolution""
* ""Does it work? Yes. Can we build it? Yes. Go ahead.""
* Result: massive construction of energy infrastructure

# The German Case: When Ideology Kills Strategy

In the middle of a brutal energy crisis (they lost Russian gas due to Ukraine invasion, since they decided not to buy from them anymore), with their industry collapsing from energy costs and the world realizing that AI needs oceans of electricity, Germany closed its last three nuclear plants on April 15, 2023.

# The Disaster Numbers

According to PwC analysis, if they had kept their nuclear plants:

* They'd have 94% clean electricity (vs. 61% current)
* They would have saved ‚Ç¨332 billion ($360 billion) in energy costs
* Electricity would be ‚Ç¨18/MWh (\~$20/MWh) cheaper

Instead, they had to go back to coal and pay more.

# Public Opinion

59% of Germans thought the closure was a mistake. But the government went ahead anyway.

# The Decision

It was made by an Ethics Commission that, although it included some scientists and economists, prioritized ethical considerations over technical and economic realities. Basically, they let post-Fukushima fear and green ideology override pragmatic analysis.

# The Result

Today Germany has more expensive energy, more pollution, an industry in crisis, and zero chance of competing in the AI race. While China builds reactors and the US extends the life of its plants, Germany chose ideological purity over economic survival.

# Water: The Other Elephant Nobody Mentions

Oh, and before you go, there's another little detail almost nobody is discussing: water.

Data centers don't just consume electricity. They need massive cooling. And that cooling uses... water. Lots of water.

In 2023, US data centers consumed 17 billion gallons (64 billion liters) of water. By 2028, hyperscalers will consume between 16 and 33 billion gallons (60-125 billion liters) per year.

And that's just direct consumption. It doesn't count the water used to generate electricity.

# Bonus Track: The Delusional Solutions

Since we're talking about physical limits, it's worth mentioning some of the most ""creative"" (read: insane) ""solutions"" circulating:

# [Space Data Centers: When Marketing Goes Off the Rails](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1oe9r33/are_orbital_data_centers_technically_feasible/)

NVIDIA is promoting Starcloud's proposal: orbital data centers with 1,544 square miles (4 km¬≤) of solar panels, promising energy will be ""10 times cheaper than on Earth"" and that ""most new data centers will be in space in 10 years.""

The technical reality is brutal:

* Impossible cooling
* Radiation
* Insane economics
* Micrometeoroids

The technical community's verdict: ""It's pure marketing""

# What We Know (And What We Don't)

Cards on the table:

# What we know:

* AI consumes obscene amounts of energy
* Those amounts will increase dramatically
* Current infrastructure isn't enough
* Building new infrastructure takes years/decades
* Someone has to pay
* China is building while others debate
* ""Space"" solutions are pure marketing
* Local projects (like Stargate) face brutal physical realities

# What we don't know:

* Is there a breakthrough in energy efficiency that changes everything?
* Can nuclear fusion arrive in time?
* Are revolutionary cooling technologies on the way?
* How much can the power grid take before collapsing?
* Is there a Plan B we don't know about?

# Final Reflection: The Physical World Exists

We live in the physical world. Not in a simulation. Not in some CEO's pitch deck trying to raise more money.

Electricity doesn't appear magically. Water doesn't materialize from nothing. Nuclear reactors aren't built with good wishes. And space data centers don't work with PowerPoints.

China seems to have understood this. The United States... well, it's betting that technology will solve technology's problems.

Maybe it'll work. Maybe it won't.

And when in 2030 you're paying 30% more for electricity and you wonder why, remember this moment.

When everyone was talking about AGI, transformers, and disruption, the real bottleneck was right there, in plain sight.

We removed the fireplace mantle a bit ago (last Christmas!) and intended to replace it as the one that was there was old and beat/scratched from the previous owner's cat (I assume). However, we haven't taken the next step because we're not really sure what to do with this space. We'll be getting new furniture, but don't even know where to start. We currently have a 77"" TV, but also own a 55"" Frame TV we were thinking about hanging on the fireplace (I know, I know...) but I'm not really sure how else to configure this space. We watch a fair amount of TV (sports), so a TV is a must. With the current set up (pictured) access to the sliding doors that lead to the back deck is blocked. If we move the couch forward, the viewing distance from the TV is way too short. My initial plan was to mount the TV over the fireplace, put a 3 seater couch on the right wall and two chairs opposite it (in front of the slider but not right up on it), with a coffee table in the middle. Is that my best option or does anyone have any other recommendations? The wall not pictured (behind where the picture is taken) is a half wall and opening that separates this space from the kitchen, so not an option for the TV.",1,1761762152.0,interiordecorating,3,1.0,False

**Chapter 81. Interlude: The lie of Kindness**

  
The black cat lounged on the windowsill with her eyes closed as a bird landed next to her. The cat didn't move but her whiskers twitched ever so slightly. The bird was a greyfeathered mockingbird. And it lifted its beak to poke at the cat's side.

Smokewell yelped out of her nap. ‚ÄúWhat in the name of‚Äì‚Äù she paused and looked at the bird that was fluttering next to her and ready to poke at her again. The cat raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúDidn't you see who I am? I can‚Äìouch!‚Äù

The bird had poked at her again.

The cat hissed at the bird, her hackles raised. ‚ÄúWith survival instincts like that, you can almost pass off as a human without much problem,‚Äù she said with a glare. Then she lifted a paw to strike at the bird when the bird swept off the windowsill. ‚ÄúWhat? Suddenly scared now?‚Äù

The bird had dove down to a place that Smokewell had to lean out of the window to see. A small nest with a couple of eggs rested on the ledge below the window and the mockingbird stood blocking the eggs with its little body like an avian shield.

Smokewell paused and regarded the bird with a deadpan look. ‚ÄúHm, so you have a family, so what? Next time you want to pick a fight, do it when they aren't around.‚Äù She rolled her eyes and slid the window shut. It was a shame since the air had been just warm enough to lull her to sleep where she dreamed of a three storey mansion, a carriage (a real one drawn by a horse), complete with a footman to roll out the carpet for her royal self to step out on and a dozen attendants who ran around to meet her every demand.

Even though her body was that of a cat's, her dreams were still shamelessly human and mostly about money. And why wouldn‚Äôt they be? After all, money was the only human invention that Smokewell could get behind. It was fascinating how humans had managed to assign value to something that didn't have any inherent value. And their entire world ran on this same imaginary value.

Humanity was a greedy race for that very reason. They decided one piece of metal was more valuable than another piece of metal. And they built the rest of their society by putting that piece of metal on a pedestal. But the worst sin that human greed had committed was that they didn't pay their cats.

Smokewell mulled over that thought for a bit. Wouldn't that mean every cat would get paid? Wouldn't that also mean, cats would just be smarter, furrier, more beautiful humans? Such an abhorrent way to live.

No, Smokewell was perfect because she was the only talking cat she knew. And money was only special because not everyone had a lot of it. That meant, Smokewell had to kill any other talking cat she ran into in the future. And she needed to make more money than most people in this country of Ravenwind did. The latter obviously held more importance in her heart.

She hopped off the windowsill and made her way past the large king sized bed at the centre and over to a tattered silken sheet laying by the wall. She set her paws on the cloth and dug her nails into the fabric, dragging them up and down, hearing the satisfying rip the material made under her claws.

She hadn't expected to enjoy something like this as much as she did yet there she was. While she was busy in the relaxing routine of tearing at the silk sheet, the door to her room swung open. The cat startled and jumped.

Lenora poked her head into the room. ‚ÄúTime for breakfast, madam,‚Äù she called out.

‚ÄúI'm not your madam,‚Äù Smokewell hissed. ‚ÄúAnd what's for breakfast?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy aren't you my madam?‚Äù Lenora said with a look of innocent betrayal.

Smokewell grunted. ‚Äú‚ÄòMadam‚Äô is the word used to address a senior witch among witches. You aren't a witch. So don't call me madam.‚Äù

Lenora's look shifted to understanding quickly. ‚ÄúOh, I see. Well, breakfast is ready, Smokey. Don't make me call for you twice.‚Äù

‚ÄúSmokey?!‚Äù Smokewell looked at her dumbfounded.

But Lenora had already walked back to the kitchen. The cat chased after her and stood in the hallway. ‚ÄúYou still didn't tell me what's for breakfast?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoiled salmon for you,‚Äù Lenora called back from the kitchen.

Oh great, Smokewell thought, boiled fish again. She padded over to the dining table and hopped onto it. Lenora laid her bowl of unseasoned raw salmon in front of her. And sat opposite to her with her own plate of sausage and beans and toast with two sunny-side-ups with a cup of coffee.

The cat watched the woman's breakfast as if Lenora had just stolen food from her plate. The woman just took a sip of her coffee as she read that morning's Orowen Tribune.

‚ÄúAren't you hungry?‚Äù Lenora asked, her eyes still moving over the newspaper.

‚ÄúYou mean am I not interested in my bland bowl of salmon?‚Äù Smokewell scoffed. ‚ÄúOf course I am! Breakfast of champions.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want something else, you can just tell me and I'll whip something up,‚Äù Lenora said, still oblivious of the cat's deadpan attention on her plate of breakfast.

The cat tilted her head. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike boiled ham or boiled chicken or boiled beef,‚Äù Lenora said.

‚ÄúHow about beans and sausage?‚Äù the cat said in the voice of someone who was asking for something they knew they weren't going to get.

Lenora finally put her newspaper down. ‚ÄúYou've said you have a problem digesting that kind of stuff.‚Äù

The cat gave a quick hiss. ‚ÄúI can digest anything! I've fought against immortal beings in an immortal realm after all! My muscles can bulk up in a blink when I absorb human souls. You think I can't eat some human gruel?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what‚Äôs stopping you from just eating it?‚Äù Lenora said.

Smokewell looked down at her bowl of boiled salmon. She mumbled something that could've passed off as gibberish.

‚ÄúI beg your pardon?‚Äù Lenora said.

‚ÄúI can't taste it,‚Äù Smokewell repeated, still averting her gaze from the woman. ‚ÄúI might be eating sand for all I know. There is just no taste. It's something of a benefit for this body. Cat s√¨ths strengthen their body by ingesting souls they had snatched. And souls don't really taste like red wine, you see? You can't bring yourself to swallow no matter how much you try to ignore their taste. So my tongue is numb to just everything that touches it. What‚Äôs the point of eating the good stuff when you don‚Äôt even know what you are swallowing?‚Äù She idly poked the salmon in her bowl with a paw.

Lenora rested her chin on her palm as she looked at the cat. ‚ÄúCan't you just turn it off while eating maybe?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere must be a way to do that. You are a witch.‚Äù

The cat wasn't amused. ‚ÄúYou think you can just snap your fingers and make anything happen with witchcraft?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can't?‚Äù Lenora asked, surprised.

‚ÄúNo, we can't.‚Äù The cat grunted, dragging her paw over her face in frustration.

‚ÄúWhat about cooking? Maybe we can cook for you in a certain way that will allow you to feel the taste? Maybe there is something you can drink or a spell you can cast over your food so it will taste the way it is meant to.‚Äù Lenora said.

Smokewell paused, just staring at the woman.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Lenora said.

‚ÄúYour marriage was crappy, wasn't it?‚Äù Smokewell said.

Lenora perked up. ‚ÄúWhy are you bringing it up all of a sudden?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long were you married again?‚Äù Smokewell said.

‚ÄúUm, six years, I believe.‚Äù Lenora nervously ran a finger through her hair.

The cat nodded. ‚ÄúSix years, eh? That's long enough.‚Äù

Lenora huffed. ‚ÄúLong enough for what? Will you stop talking in riddles?‚Äù

The cat hopped off the table. ‚ÄúCome with me. I might be onto something as always.‚Äù She started walking away from the dining table without looking back, as if sure that Lenora was following her. She wasn't wrong.

The cat led the woman up to Lily's room. ‚ÄúLook through her drawers, there must be a charcoal chalk somewhere in there,‚Äù Smokewell said, hopping onto Lily's bed and making herself comfortable.

‚ÄúUm, I don't really feel comfortable snooping through Lily's belongings,‚Äù Lenora said, scuffing her foot against the floor nervously.

‚ÄúThis isn't snooping, dimwit. I'm just telling you to find a charcoal chalk. Go through her desk,‚Äù Smokewell said.

Lenora hesitantly did as she was told, opening the drawers in Lily's desk. ‚ÄúWhat does this charcoal chalk look like?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt's a chalk made of charcoal. You'll know it when you see it.‚Äù Smokewell licked at the back of her own paw while Lenora obediently searched for the chalk.

‚ÄúDoes it look like this?‚Äù Lenora held up a small black cylindrical object with a tip that was jagged from use.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Smokewell said. ‚ÄúNow draw a twenty inch circle on the floor and then draw a five pointed star with an empty space at the center.‚Äù

Lenora obeyed once again.

‚ÄúSo, were you this subservient throughout your marriage?‚Äù Smokewell said.

Lenora frowned. ‚ÄúSubservient?‚Äù

The cat scoffed. ‚ÄúYou know what it means‚Äìhanging onto every word that people utter, carrying their expectations on your own shoulders like it was some debt you inherited, scrambling to meet those expectations with all you have and apologizing for falling short. Ring any bells?‚Äù

Lenora's mouth was one thin line as she kept drawing the pentacle.

‚ÄúKnock once for yes, twice for no,‚Äù Smokewell said.

*Knock!*

‚ÄúYeah, it seemed to be the case,‚Äù Smokewell said. ‚ÄúAnd let me guess, your husband never really saw you as his wife. Just someone who jumped through hoops for his sake?‚Äù

*Knock!*

‚ÄúYeah, predictable.‚Äù Smokewell nodded. ‚ÄúAnd let me guess further, you never confronted him, never put your foot down. You just rolled up your sleeves and kept fighting to get his praise, his acknowledgement, even if he just threw scraps of it.‚Äù

*Knock!*

‚ÄúI can see that.‚Äù Smokewell nodded again. ‚ÄúThat's why everything you cook is perfect. The house always remains clean. This morning, the floor was so slick from your mopping, I almost slipped.‚Äù The cat paused and threw a piercing look at the woman. ‚ÄúBut am I not right? When someone tells you to do something, you make it your responsibility to do it for them better than they can do it themselves. Don't you?‚Äù

*Knock! Knock!*

‚ÄúYou think I'm an idiot? Lenora, I'm a cat. Which is just a humble way of saying I'm smarter than you. And when someone erects a wall of bullshit in front of me, I can see right through it,‚Äù Smokewell said.

‚ÄúI drew it!‚Äù Lenora blurted and stood back up. ‚ÄúDoes it look good?‚Äù

The cat just stared at Lenora who stood next to the pentacle that she had drawn immaculately on the floor. Smokewell felt a mix of pity and annoyance at the innocently expectant look in the woman's eyes.

‚ÄúNo, it looks like crap. I can draw a better pentacle than you. And I don't even have a thumb!‚Äù Smokewell snapped.

Lenora froze in her spot, staring at the cat with a remorseful look. ‚ÄúI-I can draw a better one if you‚Äì‚Äù

Smokewell raised a paw at her. ‚ÄúThat right there. That apologetic sound you are making. Isn't that how you always were when you were married?‚Äù the cat said. ‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm not wrong, you were like this even before you got married.‚Äù

Lenora froze again but not in the way she had when Smokewell attacked her with her harsh words. Lenora's current state looked similar to someone who had been caught walking naked in the backyard. The woman couldn't hold the cat's piercing red gaze anymore. So she looked away, reached out towards Lily's desk with her knuckles and knocked once.

Smokewell sighed and spoke in a much softer voice. ‚ÄúJust step inside the pentacle and stand in the empty spot I told you to keep.‚Äù

Lenora still couldn't meet her gaze. But she stepped inside the pentacle without any hesitation or doubt.

‚ÄúThink about the times when this behaviour of yours backfired on you,‚Äù Smokewell said, walking up to the woman. ‚ÄúAll the times when you thought being subservient would get you through all your problems. Instead it didn't.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you telling me to do this?‚Äù Lenora asked nervously.

‚ÄúOh, so you can ask ‚Äòwhy‚Äô? I was starting to think you would jump out that window if I asked you to.‚Äù Smokewell snorted, circling the pentacle slowly like a predator. She saw Lenora's fingers begin to twitch and the woman clenched them into fists at her sides. Smokewell held back a smirk. ‚ÄúYou really think you have control over your life if you are just nice and helpful enough to others, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't‚Ä¶want to‚Ä¶answer that‚Ä¶‚Äù Lenora spoke through clenched teeth.

‚ÄúI remember when you brought that rich girl home and offered to help her out of her problem. You also dragged Lily and Elsa into that stupidity with yourself just to help out the Radcliff girl,‚Äù Smokewell said.

‚ÄúThat's called an act of kindness,‚Äù Lenora said. ‚ÄúMaybe you won't get it because you aren't a human.‚Äù

‚ÄúKindness is such a sweet word for it, isn't it?‚Äù Smokewell said, keeping her eyes focused on Lenora's body, that had gone stiff within the pentacle and her knuckles were starting to turn white. ‚ÄúLet me give you some wisdom I've gathered over my years as a human. Kindness is a lie. A sweet, beautiful lie that a soulless person tells themselves. They offer money to the homeless, food to the stray animals and warmth to someone trapped in the cold. Why? Because they are kind? No, because they can't accept that they don't have anything to make them feel better about themselves. Kindness is just one‚Äôs excuse to pat oneself on the back. The truth is, every kind person is just a hollow shell starving for someone else‚Äôs approval on their character.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù Lenora screamed. ‚ÄúI don't want to hear your vile words any more!‚Äù Her eyes were burning with rage and her voice was thick with contempt. ‚ÄúYou think kindness is a lie? You think every act of selflessness is just a way to gain someone else's approval? What if it is?! What's wrong with hoping for praise for doing a good deed? Doesn‚Äôt a good person deserve to be praised for being good? What kind of twisted world you live in where a kind person is just an egoistical monolith looking for validation, huh?!‚Äù

Smokewell didn't respond to the woman's tirade. Because the pentacle she had been standing in instantly caught fire as soon as her outburst concluded.

Lenora cried in shock and covered her head with her arms, as if afraid her hair would burn in the fire. But the fire disappeared on its own in less than two seconds. All that was left behind was blue ash in the shape of the pentacle that Lenora had drawn with charcoal.

Smokewell just smirked as Lenora‚Äôs earlier anger had completely disappeared and left her staring around herself in a daze of confusion. ‚ÄúW-What‚Ä¶happened?‚Äù she mumbled.

The cat touched the blue ash around the woman with her paw and scoffed. ‚ÄúWould you look at that now? Blue is the color of approval. Which means the test was positive.‚Äù The cat looked up at the woman with a twinkle in her red eyes. ‚ÄúYou have malice in your bones, Lenora.‚Äù

Originally I thought the Jura E4 would be perfect for that, but I'm also considering the Delonghi Magnifica Plus, Dinamica Plus (looks like it has a recent UI update and none of the YT reviews include this) because they appear to also make all kinds of other drinks that I may occasionally use (flat white, latte, etc). I know that if I want those drinks with the Jura E4 I could still make them with a separate milk warmer/ frother. 

So looking for a comparison and any input from others comparing these machines or maybe throwing other super autos into the mix.

Questions:

1. For double espresso/doppio ‚Äî Jura does two grind/brew cycles vs. DeLonghi making one larger puck. Coming from Nespresso‚Ä¶ does one method taste better?

2. Clean up/ maintenance: The big question here is how important is it that the Delonghi internals are accessible vs Jura not being accessible? I am worried about having to ship the machine off or having to hire a tech for repairs here.

Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm a student at KC International School in Jammu. A few of us are sharing this because something extremely serious has been happening here, and we can‚Äôt stay silent anymore.

CCTV cameras inside the bathrooms

Our school has installed CCTV cameras inside student bathrooms, and these cameras have a direct view of the urinals and changing areas. Students and parents were never informed about this.
Staff members have allegedly accessed this footage and even used it to suspend students who weren‚Äôt involved in any wrongdoing.

This is a major invasion of privacy and violates several laws ‚Äî IPC Section 354C (voyeurism), IT Act Sections 66E and 72 (violation and misuse of private images), and Section 17 of the Right to Education Act (mental harassment). It also breaks CBSE‚Äôs own safety and privacy guidelines for students.

We‚Äôve already reported this to Childline, the Cyber Crime portal, CBSE, NIC, the British Council, and the Directorate of School Education Jammu. We‚Äôre posting here because we want this to reach more people who can help ensure it‚Äôs properly investigated.

Abuse of a student after a suicide attempt

One of our classmates went through a really difficult time earlier this year. Her parents were in the middle of a divorce, she had lost some close friends, and she was struggling with her mental health. She used to overdose on energy drinks and coffee just to cope. Later, she was prescribed antidepressants, but one day she took too many pills in an attempt to end her life.

When she returned to school after recovering, instead of receiving support or counseling, she was accused of taking drugs and alcohol by the principal. Her mother was called to school and verbally abused, even after blood test results showed there were no drugs or alcohol in her system ‚Äî only prescribed medication. The principal refused to believe it, insulted her mother until she cried, and then suspended the student.

After returning from suspension, she again felt unwell in school and went to the sick bay. There, a receptionist reportedly spoke to her in a humiliating way and grabbed her arm roughly, leaving visible marks. When her mother was called in again, both of them were insulted and shouted at by the principal. The student was told to leave and was later expelled from the school.

Why we‚Äôre speaking out

What happened here wasn‚Äôt strict discipline ‚Äî it was abuse and harassment.
The people who should have protected students instead used their authority to humiliate and harm them.

Several of us have filed detailed complaints with multiple authorities, including Childline and Cyber Crime, and we‚Äôve sent emails to more than 50 different officials and organizations explaining everything that happened. We‚Äôve saved screenshots, messages, and other evidence safely, but we aren‚Äôt sharing them publicly to protect everyone‚Äôs privacy.

We just want this to reach people who can help ‚Äî journalists, legal experts, or anyone who can push for a real investigation. So far, we haven‚Äôt seen any visible action.

In short

‚Ä¢ CCTV cameras installed inside school bathrooms recording minors.
‚Ä¢ Footage allegedly accessed and used to suspend students.
‚Ä¢ A student recovering from a suicide attempt was verbally and physically abused, then expelled.
‚Ä¢ Complaints and reports have been sent to 50+ officials, but there‚Äôs been no response so far.

Please don‚Äôt ask for personal details or names. We‚Äôll share verifiable information privately with the right authorities if needed.

We just want this to be heard and investigated properly. Every student deserves to feel safe in their school.

Harper had just gotten home from a rough day and without hesitation, bee-lined it to his bed. A benefit of living in a studio apartment was the availability for Harper to unclothe himself right from the entrance to waste as little time as possible. He soon had the website with the recognizable orange and black logo queued up on an incognito tab. Harper popped his earbuds in and typed into the search bar one of the dozens of videos he frequented the most as he had zero intention to browse any new material. He skipped an ad, fast forwarded through a good portion of the video, and commenced with his lewd, self-indulgence. Harper had his fair share of vices and wasn‚Äôt shy to admit to them except for his porn addiction. It began not too long after Harper moved out of his parents‚Äô house and had grown from a ‚Äúevery once in a while‚Äù to a daily occurrence. He had a healthy libido, but he mainly craved the dopamine high he reached upon climaxing. Within that moment everything was simply okay. And then the emptiness followed. It was like an equivalent exchange: a moment of dread for a moment of bliss. But to Harper the dread seemed to last longer and have lasting effects on his mental state. He used to believe he had a solid mental foundation, things never really got to him. Over the years this dread wore down on the foundation, making it resemble an egg shell more than a concrete slab.
Harper finished, cleaned himself off, and took a big puff off of his THC pen. Harper let out a cloud of smoke onto his phone‚Äôs screen as he half-mindlessly scrolled through memes, ads, and thirst traps, the latter no longer having the same pull on him with the ‚Äòclarity‚Äô he gained after finishing. Another side effect of his strenuous activity was the heaviness he felt in his eyes, intensified by the weed in his system. And so, Harper allowed himself to fall asleep. 

Harper awoke an hour and a half later with his stomach groaning. He begrudgingly got off his bed and walked the few steps he needed to enter his kitchen. He opened his fridge with the hopes of finding leftovers ready to be microwaved, but his hopes were shot down by his scarce inventory. Harper didn‚Äôt really feel like cooking and opted for something frozen at most. To his increasing dismay, Harper found an empty box of Hot Pockets in his freezer, cursing himself under his breath. He exaggerated a groan before turning towards his cupboard and at least finding a box of cereal. Paring it up with the last cup of milk he had left, the bowl of cereal made for a decent enough dinner. While scrolling through social media again, Harper came across a post from one of his high school friends, one that had gone to college, graduated, and landed a good job. The post was a photo dump of his past couple of weeks, sharing a life of fun experiences and ample social interaction. Harper remembered him as a quieter kid in high school and it seemed adulthood had broken him out of his shell. The milk and cereal turned sour in Harper‚Äôs mouth and they felt like metal shavings when he swallowed it. Here was someone that Harper knew hadn‚Äôt grown privileged or popular, and yet his life was substantially richer than Harper‚Äôs. Harper wanted to ask himself where it had all gone wrong, but he couldn‚Äôt even get halfway through the question when a pit formed in his chest. Harper pushed aside his bowl of cereal and began to choke back a sob. 
Harper had tried a similar route by going to college, but he dropped out after the second year. He went on to earn minimum wage at a job he hated and built himself up enough to earn a livable wage at a different job he hated slightly less. Working was all Harper had going for him, he hadn‚Äôt maintained his friendships from high school and didn‚Äôt really have any hobbies, especially none that promoted social interaction. Harper liked movies and at most would catch a matinee on a Saturday by himself. He was always by himself. Harper took a hit off of his pen and dragged the bowl back to him, contemplating if it‚Äôs possible for him to get his life on a better path. As he munched on the cereal he figured his financial situation didn‚Äôt need immediate improvement but he definitely needed to work on his ability to socialize. He got so used to not extending a conversation beyond small talk that even his coworkers barely got the tip of the iceberg. Harper hadn‚Äôt minded that, he thought he would be fine despite not making new friends, and it was the same even with a woman he was interested in. Harper never had a girlfriend because he never tried for one, maybe he had one or two clear opportunities and yet he let them slip past him. That was back in high school when it was easy to meet potential partners, so his current lifestyle meant he had zero chance at that. The metaphorical light bulb lit up when Harper realized that could be the best way to start, sort of like skydiving first to make riding a rollercoaster not seem as bad. And so, Harper downloaded the most popular dating app available. 

Setting up his profile turned out to be harder than Harper thought as he didn‚Äôt have a variety of pictures to choose from, not many interests worth sharing, and he couldn‚Äôt figure out how to write a bio that wasn‚Äôt boring or bland. Harper decided to go with a ‚Äúshort and sweet‚Äù vibe as a way to compensate for all of that. He even took two new photos on the spot, but staged them so they wouldn‚Äôt look like last-minute additions. Altogether it took Harper more than half an hour to finish up his profile and set his field of vision to a 25 mile radius to increase his chances. He went on to swipe through the available women until he used up his daily amount, having swiped mainly to the right. Harper knew he‚Äôd need to give it some time so he set his phone down and put on a movie to pass the time. Half an hour into the movie, his phone vibrated and he immediately snatched it up to see a notification from the app: he had a match. Harper couldn‚Äôt help but smile, even chuckle at the idea that a woman actually saw potential in him as a partner. He clicked on it, but instead of taking him to the app, the notification expanded into two more notifications.
Harper had three matches and his face felt hot, surely a bright shade of red as well. He composed himself before he opened the app and made his way to the messaging feature. None of the matches had messaged him first, which he wasn‚Äôt hoping for, so the ball was entirely in his court. Thankfully, Harper didn‚Äôt have to rack his brain too much for a clever icebreaker as he had given himself an alley-oop with the last line of his bio: ‚ÄúSwipe right on me and I‚Äôll use my cheesiest pick-up line on you.‚Äù Even though he didn‚Äôt have to, Harper sent a different pick-up line to each of the women and then tried to continue watching the movie as he awaited their response. This time Harper was much more restless, checking his phone often and steadily paying less attention to the movie. At some point the one in a million chance that one of these women would want to meet that night crossed Harper‚Äôs mind, so he promptly took a shower and tidied himself up. This turned out to be the break in time Harper needed, because the next time he checked his phone he had two new messages from the app.
The first message Harper clicked on was from Daniela, a fellow 26-year-old who had received the ‚ÄúIf I could rearrange the alphabet‚Äù line. Her responses were the laughing emoji and ‚ÄúThat one is low key cute.‚Äù 
Harper smiled and responded ‚ÄúYeah but still very cheesy, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to use it in person,‚Äù along with the laughing emoji. She‚Äôd take a couple minutes to respond with ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about confidence, you can pull it off if you‚Äôre confident enough.‚Äù 
As Harper was beginning his response, feeling good about how the conversation was starting, Daniela followed up with ‚ÄúHow tall are you?‚Äù 
The energy Harper had was almost completely sapped out of him upon reading her response. 
Harper tried to be optimistic and answered with ‚ÄúAbout 5‚Äô8‚Äù lol‚Äù
After the longest minute of his life, Harper received Daniela‚Äôs last message, ‚ÄúThat explains it and next time be upfront about that,‚Äù before she removed herself from the chat.
Harper felt something inside crack, a small one but a crack nonetheless. His hands shook so he gripped the edge of his kitchen table with the empty threat of breaking off a chunk as he took deep breaths to simmer down. Harper let go of the table and quickly deleted his chat with Daniela: out of sight, out of mind. He took a hit of his pen and clicked on the second message he had received.
This message came from a 28-year-old woman named Jessica and she had received the ‚ÄúAre you from Tennessee‚Äù line. She responded with, ‚ÄúHa ha, no, I‚Äôm a Minnesota girl through and through. But I do have an uncle that lives in Tennessee.‚Äù 
Harper was still sore about his last interaction as he tried to push past it and responded with, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs either a crazy coincidence or proof that I‚Äôm a psychic,‚Äù followed by the inquisitive emoji. Harper finished the movie he had momentarily ignored and was looking for a second one to watch when his phone vibrated. Harper grabbed his phone and opened Jessica‚Äôs message, reading, ‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôre a psychic then tell me my future.‚Äù 
Her playful tone eased Harper‚Äôs tension completely as he replied, ‚ÄúI think I see you and I going out for a drink tonight.‚Äù 
Despite his recent aggression and the wit behind that line, Harper‚Äôs hands became clammy and he had to put his phone down to wipe them off on his pants. In less than a minute, Jessica replied with, ‚ÄúUgh, I can‚Äôt do tonight‚Äù followed by the weary emoji. A second message was delivered, ‚ÄúHow about tomorrow night?‚Äù accompanied by the grinning emoji. Harper grew the biggest smile he‚Äôs had in years and blurted out loud, ‚ÄúHoly shit, it‚Äôs actually happening!‚Äù 
Harper collected himself and answered, ‚ÄúOf course, that sounds just as great.‚Äù 
Jessica replied quickly with, ‚ÄúAwesome, I‚Äôve gotta go for now, so I‚Äôll talk to you tomorrow. Have a good night,‚Äù concluding with the smiling emoji. Harper sent a ‚ÄúGoodnight‚Äù paired with the same emoji before dropping his phone as a wave of euphoria washed over him.
‚ÄúI actually did it,‚Äù Harper said to himself. While basking in his victory a voice crawled through the crack in his mental foundation and asked with a tone indistinguishable between malice and dread, ‚ÄúWhat if she cancels on you?‚Äù
The emptiness was back and Harper felt himself shrink. He wasn‚Äôt able to immediately shrug off that fleeting thought, so it weighed on him. It made him think about a future text from Jessica that would prove it right. He thought about how it would be the same with every other match he managed to get. That or they‚Äôd knock him down first like Daniela did. This flared up anger within Harper as he thought about how easily Daniela was able to dismiss him over something like his height. Harper swung a right hook into his fridge, slightly denting it. He slowly pulled his fist back and saw there wasn‚Äôt any damage, it only partially throbbed with pain. 
‚ÄúJust forget about her,‚Äù Harper thought to himself as he shook the pain away from his hand. He then checked the time on his phone and saw it was almost 10pm. Harper decided if there was ever a night for him to try to go to sleep by midnight it‚Äôd be tonight. He found a second movie to watch, opted for water rather than beer, and snuggled into his bed to wrap up the night. Fifteen minutes later, his phone vibrated.
Harper was elated, thinking it was Jessica after she found time to continue their conversation. Sure enough the notification came from the app and Harper clicked on it with lightning speed. His excitement subsided when he saw it wasn‚Äôt from Jessica, rather it was from the third woman that he matched with.
The third woman, a 23-year-old by the name of Megan, had responded with, ‚ÄúWhy, because I look busted?‚Äù 
Harper was completely thrown off, wondering if he had misspoken with the pick-up line he sent. Then again, did he even care enough to reply now that he had a confirmed date with Jessica? There was nothing stopping him from unmatching with this third woman and making his profile unavailable to new eyes, but Harper figured he shouldn‚Äôt put all of his eggs into one basket. Plus it would be rude to not only ghost Megan, but to do so after a possible miscommunication. Just then, Harper remembered that he had sent Megan the ‚ÄúDid it hurt when you fell from Heaven‚Äù line. He opened the chat and sure enough that was the case, making Harper laugh in hindsight. He responded with, ‚ÄúWe both know that‚Äôs a lie‚Äù, then glanced at her profile before messaging,  ‚ÄúWhat kind of movies do you like?‚Äù 
Megan quickly  replied with, ‚ÄúI like every kind of movie, but horror is my favorite.‚Äù 
Harper‚Äôs message back was, ‚ÄúHorror is definitely up there for me as far as genres go. I recently watched The Collector again.‚Äù
 Megan responded with, ‚ÄúLove a good slasher, though I prefer creature features. Have you ever watched Tremors?‚Äù 
Harper waded through his memory and then answered ‚ÄúIt sounds familiar but I don‚Äôt think I have.‚Äù 
Megan responded with, ‚ÄúThen you should come over so I can pop that cherry for you.‚Äù
Harper felt like he had just made the game-winning shot in back to back games. Despite his wishful thinking earlier of possibly meeting someone that night, Harper still couldn‚Äôt believe a woman invited him over after a handful of messages. And despite his plans to sleep early, Harper responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm down, just send me your address and I‚Äôll be over soon.‚Äù 
As he got himself together, Megan sent her address along with ‚ÄúMake that sooner than possible.‚Äù
In less than five minutes, Harper was out the door and skipping steps down the stairwell of his apartment building. He input the address into his phone on the way to the garage and sped off as soon as he got into his car.

Twenty minutes later, Harper pulled up to a nice house in an upper-middle class neighborhood. Harper wasn‚Äôt a stranger to neighborhoods like that, but he wasn‚Äôt entirely familiar either. His parents would drive him and his siblings well out of their way to neighborhoods like this to trick or treat at. Harper always wanted to live in a neighborhood like that with a house big enough so he wouldn‚Äôt have to share a room. His parents did the best they could, he didn‚Äôt blame them. Harper let Megan know he had just arrived through the app and got out of his car to wait for her reply. Harper went around the car and leaned against the passenger door, trying his best to ease his nerves. He watched the front door of the house open and a woman stepped out halfway as she called out, ‚ÄúCome on in, Harper!‚Äù
The night gave her hair the appearance of black, but the light from within the house revealed it to be a hazelnut brown. It draped down past her collarbone and laid on top of the white tee that complimented her figure. She wore black shorts, their short length made her legs seemingly extend farther than they actually did. And her smile, you‚Äôd think was magical with the way it had Harper walking before he even realized and he soon reached the door.
‚ÄúClearly you‚Äôre Megan, unless you happen to be her twin,‚Äù Harper commented. 
‚ÄúThankfully there‚Äôs only one of me,‚Äù Megan joked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enough of a handful as it is.‚Äù 
Harper stepped in and instantly felt warm, like he was always meant to be there. 
‚ÄúYou can leave your shoes next to the door and your jacket in that closet,‚Äù Megan instructed as she made her way to the couch ahead of them, flipping off a light switch along the way. Harper caught himself staring before following her orders. He approached the couch as Megan tapped the cushion next to her and saw the array of snacks on the coffee table. He grabbed a water bottle and placed it to his right as he sat down, unconsciously setting a barrier between him and Megan.
‚ÄúNice spread and even nicer house,‚Äù Harper said as he looked around, ‚ÄúDo you live here on your own?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs my childhood home actually,‚Äù Megan answered, ‚ÄúMy parents left it to me after they decided to move to a place closer to the wilderness; we‚Äôre big outdoorsy people. I woulda had a roommate but my sister moved in with her college friends instead.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm very jealous,‚Äù Harper admitted, ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs equally impressive you can maintain this place on your own.‚Äù
‚ÄúI do well financially speaking and all from home,‚Äù Megan remarked. She then snatched a remote and navigated through the multiple streaming services listed on her TV in search of the movie Tremors.
‚ÄúWhat do you do, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking,‚Äù Harper asked.
‚ÄúMarketing, it‚Äôs no big deal but the meetings are abundant and exhausting,‚Äù Megan said as she feigned distress before giving a small laugh, ‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù
‚ÄúI work in a factory, it‚Äôs repetitive and relatively simple stuff but it can get pretty strenuous,‚Äù Harper answered. 
‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve got that blue collar strength,‚Äù Megan surmised. 
Harper laughed, ‚ÄúI guess but it‚Äôs not much, just enough to get my job done.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre selling yourself short,‚Äù Megan said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre ideal for a moving day. Got all the friends ringing you up for help.‚Äù She finally found the movie and started it.
‚ÄúMaybe but I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends,‚Äù Harper said before he could think. He regretted it but continued anyway, ‚ÄúI had a good amount of friends in high school but life happens. Now I barely keep in touch through socials.‚Äù
‚ÄúI get that, it feels like that‚Äôs more common than anyone would expect,‚Äù Megan said, her tone dropping for a second before bubbling back up, ‚ÄúThen you gotta learn how to make friends as an adult, which isn‚Äôt as complicated as it was when we were teenagers. It‚Äôs just that now everyone isn‚Äôt as available as we used to be.‚Äù
Harper smiled and said, ‚ÄúYeah, you just gotta make the effort and put yourself out there.‚Äù
Harper and Megan watched the movie remotely uninterrupted for almost an hour, remarks and jokes were sporadically made. Over the course of said time, Harper noticed that the space between them had been shrinking. He was sure it wasn‚Äôt him, he wasn‚Äôt one to be forward like that, For once in his life, Harper got the clue and knew he had to make a move. 
Harper cunningly picked up the water bottle to take his first drink from it, placed it on his left side, and moved right next to Megan in the process. Then as casually as he could, Harper raised his arm and placed it on the top of the couch. Megan reciprocated his actions by resting her head on his shoulder. Harper placed his arm on her to seal the deal and goosebumps erupted all over his body upon contact with her soft skin. He felt like his temperature was rising, his skin prickling off the alluring scent from her hair. Harper tried to maintain his breathing normal as his lungs seemingly exaggerated their expansion. 
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Megan spoke and as if it were a spell, that single word manifested into a hand that grabbed Harper by the chin and turned him to face her. She raised her face towards his until their noses and lips were separated by mere molecules. Harper‚Äôs entire body was in a state similar to fight or flight as he couldn‚Äôt decide on giving into his hormones or breakaway before embarrassing himself. Illuminated by the TV‚Äôs glow, Harper‚Äôs earlier pick-up line held true to Megan as he beheld her divinity and despite how low he held himself, he dared to go beyond the mortal plane and met heaven through the lips of Megan. A supernova erupted within Harper as he and Megan‚Äôs kisses progressed from brief and gentle to drawn out and heavy. Harper‚Äôs hands instinctively explored Megan‚Äôs body, he felt her hands do the same. Just as things were ramping up, Megan broke away and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take this to my room.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Harper said as he caught his breath, enthusiastically nodding along. Megan rose from the couch and held out her hand, leading Harper away after he placed his hand in hers. The windows practically fogged up as they walked past them and Harper felt a similar sensation as he had when the couple of times he took acid. For despite the only light coming from the full moon, it was enough to fully illuminate the house as Megan led him to her room. Harper wanted to take into account every detail of this night, he felt it would be one of the most pivotal experiences he‚Äôd have. 
Megan opened the door to her room and Harper felt he had entered a whole new world after crossing the threshold. Megan guided him to sit on her bed as she remained standing. Harper looked up at her with the eyes of someone looking up at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for the first time. Megan removed her shirt and revealed a black bra. The contrast between her black attire, dark hair, and white skin was enough to give Megan‚Äôs skin the illusion of a glow, like a heavenly body in the night sky. Harper followed her lead, though his skin was just tan enough that it didn‚Äôt mimic the same glow. Megan straddled Harper and she ran her hands through his hair while his hands gripped her body close to his. They resumed their kissing with a higher intensity than before. At some point, Megan guided Harper‚Äôs hands away from her body, put her hands on his shoulders, and with a sudden shift in weight, pinned Harper down to her bed. Harper was taken aback momentarily, but what Megan did next made him pay no further mind to it. Megan created a path from his lips, to his neck, down his chest, and beyond his abdomen. Harper‚Äôs heartbeat reached a speed he had never experienced before as he feebly reached to unbuckle his pants. Megan turned his hands away as she worked the buckle instead, Harper‚Äôs rising excitement not making it any easier for her. Harper felt his waistline loosened and he helped Megan get his jeans at least down to his ankles, the presence of Megan‚Äôs hands on his inner thighs pinning him back down to the bed. Megan teased him further with trailing hands and  playful bites. Harper was feeling like he was about to explode when a sudden fatigue set in and it steadily increased. He struggled to keep his eyes open as his eyelids felt like sandbags, only to then be met with blurred vision. Harper tried to sit up, but one of  Megan‚Äôs hands landed on his chest to guide him back down while the other began to tug on his boxer briefs. Harper was caught between his volcanic lust and rising concern for his spontaneous symptoms. Ultimately, Harper also got it into his head that he might end up embarrassing himself, so he decided he should say something. ‚ÄúHold on, I don‚Äôt feel-,‚Äù is all Harper was able to get out before he plunged into total darkness.


A strong smell pulled Harper out of one darkness and into another. His body still felt heavy and his mind felt like a turbulent sea slowly easing to a calm after a passing storm. Harper tried to wipe his face, but he found himself secured to the chair he sat on. There were bindings on his limbs, he could tell it was duct tape with the way it felt on his skin and from what he could see via the moonlight streaming through the windows. Then he made out a figure ahead of him in the darkness and his heart jumped. Based on the faint silhouette, Harper asked, ‚ÄúMegan?‚Äù
There was a pause followed by two, indistinguishable sounds that spawned a small flame within a lantern. The flame revealed the figure to indeed be Megan, still wearing the t-shirt and shorts combo, but her expression was completely different than before. She was equal parts solemn and indifferent, as if she was aware of an impending doom and was resigned to that fate. Megan had been looking down and when her eyes flicked up to meet Harper‚Äôs, he could swear their color was lighter than he remembered. Harper broke the silence, ‚ÄúMegan, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù
‚ÄúSomething bad,‚Äù she plainly stated. 
Harper‚Äôs leg began to shake and he began to subtly apply pressure against his constraints, ‚ÄúMegan, please, you can let me go and I won‚Äôt tell anyone. I promise I‚Äôm not clever enough to trick you, I just want to go home.‚Äù
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let you go, Harper,‚Äù Megan said with an unwavering bleakness, ‚ÄúThis is something I have to do.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat exactly do you have to do,‚Äù Harper blurted out with a panic, his breathing becoming staccato.
Megan exhaled through her nose and said, ‚ÄúI have a curse and if I don‚Äôt satisfy it, worse things will happen.‚Äù
Harper let out a short laugh due to sheer bewilderment, ‚ÄúA curse? Are you fucking- you‚Äôre fucking with me, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a joke,‚Äù Megan said with a reserved anger. It reminded Harper of the danger he was in, so he nodded as Megan continued, ‚ÄúThis also explains why I don‚Äôt have much of a support system anymore. Years ago, my group of high school friends and I decided to go camping right after graduation. Like I said, my family is big into the outdoors and my friends weren‚Äôt strangers to it either. That‚Äôs why we decided to really rough it this time and camp outside of the regulated grounds. In a way we wanted to conquer the great unknown of nature to give us the confidence to then conquer the great unknown of adulthood. We were only out there for two nights, but something targeted us after the first one. It then set out to hunt on the second. There were five of us at the start and by the end I barely clung on to life while my last surviving friend dragged me out of that forest. We thought we were safe, that we got away, but we had only escaped death. That monster left us with the same curse that allowed its existence.‚Äù
Harper slowly cleared his throat and said, ‚ÄúMegan, I don‚Äôt doubt what happened to you but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre cursed, I think you have PTSD.‚Äù
‚ÄúTherapists said the same thing, that and survivor‚Äôs guilt,‚Äù Megan responded, ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt explain the physical changes I go through. Although I didn‚Äôt tell them about that, otherwise they‚Äôd definitely think I‚Äôve gone crazy. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre thinking the same and I don‚Äôt blame you. I‚Äôll at least do you the courtesy of showing you.‚Äù Megan set down the lantern in between them and then rolled up her left sleeve. Harper watched as she then nicked the inside of her bicep and before he could react, he watched her dig into the wound with her right index and middle fingers. 
Harper screamed in abject horror, ‚ÄúMegan, stop,‚Äù until his voice was completely ripped out by what he saw next. It was unfathomable, it went against everything Harper understood of the universe and its laws of physics. He watched Megan rip the skin off her left arm and unleash a sea of partially matted fur covering an arm much larger than the original. The increase of density was clear along with its length as her new wrist went past her knee. Megan began slouched to the side before she aligned herself upright, shaking wet matter off her new arm and flexing the clawed fingers. Megan looked back at Harper with a raw sienna instead of the original brown in her eyes, ‚ÄúDo you understand now?‚Äù
Harper achieved a state close to brain death for a moment as he struggled to process this revelation. He made a conclusion that brought him to tears before he vocalized it, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna eat me now.‚Äù
‚ÄúI wish it were that simple,‚Äù Megan stated, ‚ÄúUnfortunately that‚Äôs not enough for the beast within. 
It  craves the hunt more than flesh and if I don‚Äôt satisfy that aspect as well, I risk losing complete control while in the fully transformed state. That‚Äôs why I began bringing its prey to this cabin my family no longer uses.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy me,‚Äù is all Harper had left to ask.
Megan swallowed a lump in her throat and answered, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing personal, I actually had a good time getting to know you. But it‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôre on your own, just like me, and by choosing loners I run less of a risk of being found out.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBecause no one will come looking for us,‚Äù Harper said with a rasp in his voice. Megan simply confirmed his statement with a nod. She stepped towards him and his whole body flinched and resisted against the bindings. 
Megan stopped right in front of him, extended her left arm towards his right forearm, said, ‚ÄúThe hunt has to begin,‚Äù and freed his arm with a single claw as it cut through the tape with ease. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have at least five minutes,‚Äù Megan continued as she handed him a utility knife, ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt get your hopes up.‚Äù 
She then turned away from him and walked out the cabin, leaving the door wide open.",2,1761761826.0,creepcast,0,0.76,False

1ojc5mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1ojc5mg/built_a_privacy_calendar_with_smooth_user/,"Built a privacy calendar with smooth user experience, looking for early testers","I got tired of choosing between privacy and a calendar that's actually pleasant to use, so I spent the last few months building one.

It's encrypted end-to-end, has a modern UI, drag-and-drop scheduling, cloud sync, and natural language input (""coffee with Sarah tomorrow at 3pm"" just works).

It's still rough around the edges: web only (for now), missing some features like mobile apps and advanced sharing, but the core experience is solid.

Looking for ~10 people to test it and give feedback. Lifetime free access for early users.

Please comment or DM if interested. Thank you!",3,1761761797.0,degoogle,8,1.0,False
