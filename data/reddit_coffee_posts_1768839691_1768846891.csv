1qhc1ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qhc1ky/strained_relationship_with_adhd_mom/,Strained Relationship with ADHD Mom,"I don’t know if this is the best place to post this and ask for advice but I am so desperate at this point.

I do not have ADHD but my 58 year old mother is diagnosed and currently on medication for it. She is also going through menopause which I believe is making her symptoms so much worse. 

She wasn’t like this until maybe 5 years ago. Now, her house is a wreck. Her dogs are hardly potty trained and there are dried up pee puddles all over her house. She has birds and has let them free a few times in the house. When I visited there was bird poo on the coffee table, I came back the next weekend and it was still there. Cupboards are crammed with junk. The fridge and cupboards have rotting food. The bathroom toilet is absolutely disgusting. She invited a bunch of our family over a few weekends ago and had over a week to prepare but didn’t. The day of everyone’s arrival, she drove into town last minute to get groceries, didn’t get home until after everyone arrived, the house was disgusting, my dad tried to ask her what the heck she was thinking and she bit his head off. My cousin and I spent hours cleaning her house that weekend instead of spending time with family. It’s to the point I feel like I need to wash my hands constantly while there because I feel so gross. She works 4 hour shifts 2 days a week so it’s not like she doesn’t have the time, she literally just cannot manage her time at all. She spends her time doom scrolling TikTok all day and until 3am, sleeps in late and is constantly finding new hobbies to start and not complete instead of taking care of any real responsibilities. She impulse spends like crazy. To the point I’m worried that my dad, who has Parkinson’s, will never be able to retire. I have three very young kids and I’m just exhausted trying to help her while dealing with my own responsibilities. She loves when my kids come and visit but I am to the point where I don’t want to visit or send them there to spend time with her because of how disgusting her house is. She is VERY emotionally disregulated, impulsive, and this is the tip of the iceberg on what I’ve been dealing with with her. She has started so many fires in our relationship with her impulsive behaviour and has crossed big boundaries with our kids, and when I address any of it she blows up, then sweeps it all under the rug and doesn’t apologize or take accountability for any of it. Our relationship is so hostile now because of how she acts and the big issues left unaddressed because she doesn’t care to take accountability. 

After doing a lot of research it sounds like she would benefit from a change in medication and hormone therapy as well as cognitive behavioural therapy But she doesn’t take any of what I say seriously. It is getting progressively worse and I don’t know what to do. I’m actually scared for their future as well as my own. I approach all of this with kindness with her always, but I’m honestly just fed up and exhausted with it at this point. I want my mom back. I want my kids to have a normal grandmother. I know that sounds horrible. But it’s how I feel. ",1,1768846738.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1qhc10p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1qhc10p/most_strong_marriages_dont_look_impressive_thats/,Most strong marriages don’t look impressive. That’s the point.,"I’ve been doom-scrolling relationship content and it’s always extremes. Either “we’re soulmates and never fight” or “marriage ruined my life.” No middle ground. Which is funny, because research says the boring middle is where most good marriages live.

I went down the rabbit hole reading books, listening to therapy podcasts, using reflection apps at 1am, and one thing kept coming up: **people panic about the wrong signals**.

Here’s what actually points to a solid marriage, even if it doesn’t feel Instagram-worthy:

* **You can be boring together without anxiety.** Sitting in silence, parallel scrolling, half-watching TV. Esther Perel talks about this all the time on [Where Should We Begin?](https://open.spotify.com/show/3fKOTwtnX5oZLaiNntKWAV). Comfort without panic is a green flag, not a spark killer.
* **You fight, but you repair.** [John Gottman’s research (The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work)](https://www.gottman.com/product/the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work/) shows conflict isn’t the issue. Contempt and no repair are. If you argue without name-calling and eventually come back together, you’re doing better than you think.
* **You have tiny rituals.** Inside jokes, specific ways of saying goodnight, coffee made without asking. Gottman calls these “bids for connection.” They matter more than big romantic gestures.
* **You don’t obsessively compare.** Secure couples don’t spiral over other people’s highlight reels. [Attached by Amir Levine](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139) explains this well. Feeling settled instead of constantly evaluating your relationship is a sign of security, not complacency.
* **You can ask for needs plainly.** “I need space.” “I feel disconnected.” No scripts, no emotional buildup. Brené Brown and Harriet Lerner both emphasize this. Directness without shame is rare and powerful.
* **It’s ‘us vs the problem.’** Even if you mess up at first, you course-correct. [Hold Me Tight by Sue Johnson](https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Me-Tight-Conversations-Lifetime/dp/031611300X) breaks this down beautifully. Most fights are about reassurance, not the surface issue.

I didn’t just learn this from books. A lot of it clicked through quieter tools people don’t really post about. Stuff like [Bloom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloom/id292792586), [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748), [Paired](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paired-couples-relationship/id1469609343), journaling apps, and yeah, BeFreed when I wanted someone to explain relationship psychology without me reading 300 pages.

[BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)was useful because I could type something like “why do small arguments feel so big in marriage” or “how to repair after conflict” and get short audio breakdowns pulled from actual research and therapists. Not hype, not influencer advice. Just patterns explained clearly. Easy to listen to while walking or cleaning, which honestly made it stick more.

Last thing that stood out across everything:  
**strong couples don’t keep score**. They’re not tallying chores, sex, apologies. They feel more generous than resentful most days. That’s it.

Good marriages aren’t loud. They’re two imperfect people choosing each other through boring weeks, mild annoyance, repair, and routine. If that’s you, you’re probably doing way better than the internet would have you believe.",1,1768846704.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

1qhc0dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmen/comments/1qhc0dv/outside_of_church_and_the_club_where_are_some/,"Outside of church and the club, where are some other places to meet mid-20s black women who are looking to date?","Hey yall. So I asked this question about a year ago and since then, I’ve made a good amount of effort to go out and try new things with the goal of meeting people. 

About me: I’m 25, currently working as a teacher and taking classes part time for a different degree. I love learning, staying active and trying new things. 

I only went on 6 first dates last year, and one of them led to anything serious😕. 3 of them were from Hinge. 3 of them were people I met in real life. 

Of the 3 I met through Hinge, 2 of them ghosted me, and I ended things with the third girl because we weren’t compatible. 

Of the 3 girls I met irl, none of them were women whom I was interested in pursuing a relationship with.

Here are the places I went to try and meet people:

1. **University clubs/organizations**: This is where I met all 3 of the girls that I dated irl. This is probably the only place where people seemed open to connections. 

2. **Meetups**: I went to a black people meetup in my city, but I ended up being the youngest person there

3. **Food festivals/farmer’s markets**: The food was great, but it didn’t seem like an appropriate place to try and ask for someone’s number. All of the women there were with their friends. I still enjoy going though. 

4. **Rock climbing/bouldering gyms:** People usually go in groups and only stay and talk to their friends the whole time. I ended up enjoying climbing though and now I go weekly as part of my fitness routine. 

5. **Bookstores:** I love to read, so I go to bookstores frequently. However most people are there browsing and talking with friends. The girls who are by themselves are usually reading a book with their headphones on. 

6. **Coffee shops:** Similar to bookstores, women are usually there with their friends. The ones who are there alone are usually reading or working on a laptop with their headphones on. 

7. **Dating apps:** I’ve matched with dozens of women on Hinge. The vast majority of them never responded to my initial message or just stopped responding randomly. 

So my questions for those who are dating are, **where are we meeting women who are interested in a relationship? What are some spot places to meet women who are open to a connection?**

I’d also love to know how yall are going about making the initial approach and setting the date. 

Thanks in advance. ",1,1768846668.0,blackmen,0,1.0,False

Seriously, it hard-counters Dons biggest power move - leaving meetings.

Imagine it. Bad boy Don, genius of Madison Avenue, delivers the perfect closing line. The argument is over, even if the rest of the room doesn't know it yet. He gets to his feet, objections falling off his back line rain off a London fog overcoat. Heads for the door. Will he disappear for the day? For the month? Will he burst back in with some brilliant idea. Even the guys who hate him want to know what he-

Oh wait it's locked. He rattles the knob. Awkward silence. Maybe he's got a witticism in his pocket, but it doesn't open the door.

There's a million counters from this position:

""Going somewhere, Don?""

 ""I guess you'll have to ask the secretary to open up."" 

""Get me a coffee while you're up, huh Don?""

""Stretching your legs, Draper?""

Even Betty should have tried it. Not like, imprisoning him. Just interrupting his vanishing act is enough to make it look as childish as it fundamentally is.

Alternative options would be conducting a meeting on a boat, although personally I wouldn't put it past Don to just swim to shore if the meeting was boring enough.",3,1768846646.0,madmen,1,0.8,False

I didn’t realize how long it had been until my mom mentioned it over the phone. Back then, she still made me go with her, long drives and long nights in a house that always felt like it was swallowed by the swamp. Somewhere along the way, the visits just stopped. Life got in the way. My mom called me on a Tuesday evening.


“She’s still living out there by herself,” she said. “And she isn’t doing like she used to.”


Grandma had been widowed for ten years. Grandpa passed quietly in his sleep, and she never left that house after. Neighbors came by to check on her, bring groceries, help with chores. But she wouldn’t move. “The land won’t let me,” she told my mom once, and I never really understood what she meant.


“She’s been asking about you,” my mom said. “You should go see her.” So I did.

The drive from New Orleans took longer than I remembered. Streetlights got fewer and fewer until they disappeared. The paved roads turned into dirt roads that got narrower the farther I went. The swamp felt like it was pressing close on both sides. Spanish moss hung from the trees, heavy and still. Water puddled in the low spots. The smell of mud and wet plants stuck to the air and my clothes.


I had to park my car about half a mile from her house. The road past that point had turned into mud so soft it would have swallowed my car. I grabbed my bag and started walking. My shoes sank a little with each step, and the wet smell of the swamp stayed in my nose.


Her house was at the edge of the water, lifted on cinder blocks so it looked like it was floating above the swamp. A narrow wooden dock stretched out from the porch into the dark water. I could hear it creak under the wind. The house itself looked smaller than I remembered, like it had been settling into the swamp for decades. She opened the door herself.


She was thinner than I remembered and bent in ways that made me worry, but her eyes were still sharp. She leaned on the doorframe and reached for me. She stood long enough to hug me, her hands gripping my shirt like she needed to make sure I was real.


“Lord, child, you done let the years slip by.” she said, her tone in that classic grandma nag. “I didn’t forget,” I told her. She laughed softly. “Mm. That’s what they all say.”

Inside, the house smelled like old wood and dried herbs, with something sharp underneath it all. The curtains were drawn even though it was still daylight. I noticed little things without really thinking about them. White lines near the doorframe, a small cloth bundle pinned high on the wall where only the eyes could reach it.


I didn’t ask about them. Something told me not to.


That night, after the neighbors had gone and the swamp swallowed the sun, the night sounds came alive. Frogs called across the water. Insects buzzed thick in the air. Somewhere deep in the distance, an alligator bellowed, long and low, the sound rolling through the ground like it was alive under my feet.

Grandma sat in her chair, listening. “They stirred up tonight,” she said. “It’s just noise,” I said. “Same as always.” She looked at me for a long moment. “Baby,” she said, “you ain’t been here long enough to know what always sound like.” I laughed lightly. I thought she was just teasing me like she used to.


I’m not laughing about it now.
 

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The heat from the day hadn’t left, and the air was thick with cicadas screaming so loud it felt like it was shaking the walls. Somewhere in the swamp, water splashed against something, maybe a branch, maybe a fish. I kept turning over in bed, listening, but the sounds only made it worse.


I got up to grab a glass of water, hoping it would settle me. The hallway was dark, the floorboards creaking under my weight. I stepped out onto the porch, the night thick around me. The deck smelled like wet wood and moss, the swamp smelling sharper than it had during the day. I leaned against the railing and tried to breathe. That’s when I saw it. A little glint of light, far out in the water, reflecting the moon. I squinted. It was down there at the bottom, just barely visible through the dark water. I leaned closer, curiosity winning over caution. It looked like some kind of pendant, maybe old and made of brass or silver, tangled in weeds.


I reached for it, and then I froze. A low bellow rolled out from the water, deep and menacing. My heart jumped. I whipped my head toward the sound. From the far edge of the swamp, something massive moved through the dark water. A bull gator, thick and huge, pushed itself into the shallow part near the deck. Its head broke the surface, glinting eyes catching the moonlight. The water rippled as it moved, slow and deliberate, like it knew I was there.


I tried to step back, planning to get away from the edge, but one of the deck planks groaned and gave out under me. I fell through.
Water hit me fast and cold, I was never a good swimmer. I kept thinking about that gator, just below me somewhere, waiting.
Somehow I was able to grab the deck and pull myself up. I looked down at the hole where the plank had broken. The bull gator slid past slowly, scales glinting under the moon, just where I had fallen. My hands shook and my was heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst.


I went back inside, dripping and shivering. Grandma was in the kitchen, calling out my name. “You all right, baby?” she said. Her voice was calm, but her eyes were sharp when she saw me. “I… yeah. I’m fine,” I said, dripping water onto the floor. She shook her head, a little smile on her lips. “Those planks were going to give out some day anyway. It’s all right. Go get yourself changed.” I did as she said, but I didn’t sleep much after that. 

Every sound from the swamp kept me awake, the cicadas, the water, something moving just beyond sight. I kept thinking about that pendant at the bottom and the bull gator, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had only just begun to notice how alive the swamp really was.


The next morning, Grandma sent me into town. She gave me a short list written in shaky handwriting. Milk, bread, her blood pressure medicine, and the kind of coffee she liked even though the doctor told her not to drink it anymore. The town was small, just a single grocery store, a gas station, and a few buildings that looked like they had been there longer than anyone alive.


The drive was quiet. Trees crowded the road on both sides, and the swamp followed me most of the way, water flashing between trunks. I felt better being away from the house, like I could finally breathe again. The city had taught me to trust noise. Silence always made me uneasy.


The grocery store was cool inside, the air smelling like old fruit and cleaner. There were only a few people shopping, all of them quiet, moving slow. I grabbed what was on Grandma’s list and headed to the counter.
That’s when I noticed the clerk’s necklace.
It was small, hanging on a thin chain, but I knew it right away. The shape was the same as the pendant I had seen in the swamp. Same curves, same strange markings carved into it. My stomach dropped.
“Hey,” I said, trying to sound casual. “That necklace. Where’d you get it?”


The clerk stopped moving. He didn’t look up at first. Then his eyes lifted and locked onto mine. They were flat. Empty. Like he was looking through me instead of at me.
For a second, I thought maybe he hadn’t heard me. I opened my mouth to repeat myself, but before I could, he rang up my items and said my total. His voice was normal. Calm. Like nothing had happened.
I paid and took my bags, my hands sweating. As I turned to leave, I felt it. That crawling feeling on the back of my neck. Like someone was watching me. I glanced back over my shoulder. The clerk was still staring at me.
I pushed the door open and stepped outside, the heat hitting me hard. Even then, I didn’t feel alone. I walked to my car with that same feeling following me.


That night is when things really started to feel wrong. The sun went down, bleeding through the trees before the swamp swallowed it whole. Grandma went to bed early. She always did. I could hear her radio murmuring through the thin walls, gospel low enough to feel more like a hum than music.
Outside, the cicadas had been loud all evening. Screaming like they were trying to tear the night open. I sat on the edge of the bed scrolling on my phone, trying to ignore how tight my chest felt.


Then, all at once, the noise stopped.
Not faded. Not slowed down. Just gone.
I froze. I grew up in Louisiana. I knew the swamp never went quiet unless something was very wrong. Even the city had its sounds at night. Sirens, cars, people. Silence like that felt heavy, like pressure on my ears. I got up and went to the kitchen for a glass of water. My hands were shaking, and I told myself it was just nerves. Long day. Not enough sleep. That’s what city life teaches you to say when things don’t make sense.


I stepped out onto the deck for air. The moon was high, shining down on the water. The swamp looked flat and still, like black glass. No frogs. No insects. Nothing moving.
That’s when I heard the whispering.
It wasn’t loud. It sounded like voices carried underwater. Soft and layered, like a crowd speaking all at once but too far away to understand. My skin prickled. I turned around.


They were standing at the edge of the yard, where the grass gave way to mud. At least five of them. Maybe more. They wore old clothes, the kind you see in history books. Long coats, dresses hanging loose and heavy with wet. Everything about them was dark and soaked, like they had climbed straight out of the swamp.


Their heads weren’t human. Each one wore the rotted head of a gator, skin peeling, teeth showing through torn flesh. Mud dripped from their jaws. Around their necks, every single one of them wore the same pendant I had seen in the water. The same one the clerk had worn. It caught the moonlight and gleamed. They didn’t move. They didn’t speak.
Then, all at once, they raised their arms and pointed at me. That’s the last thing I remember.


I woke up in my bed like nothing had happened. Morning light was coming through the thin curtains, pale and gray. For a second, I thought maybe I was back home in the city. Then I heard the swamp. Water shifting. A bird calling far off. The house creaking the way it always did.


My clothes were dry. My body felt sore, like I had slept wrong, but there was no mud, no water, no sign I had ever been outside.
Grandma was already up. I could hear her in the kitchen, moving slow, dishes clinking together. When I came out, she was standing at the sink, leaning heavy on the counter.
“You up now,” she said without turning around. “Good. These joints ain’t what they used to be.” I took her place and started washing. The water was cold. Everything was too normal. I kept replaying the night in my head, every detail sharp like it had just happened.


“I had a dream,” I said finally. She hummed, like she already knew. “A bad one,” I added. “Real bad. Felt… real.” She didn’t answer right away. I scrubbed a plate harder than I needed to. I told her about the silence. About the people. I didn’t say gator heads at first, but the words came out anyway. I told her how they pointed at me. How I woke up shaking.
She set a dish towel down slow and looked at me. Her eyes were cloudy with age, but sharp underneath.


“Dreams don’t always mean something.” she said. I laughed a little, tried to shake it off. “I know. Just saying it felt different. Like it wasn’t just in my head.” She was quiet for a long moment. Outside, something splashed in the water. “Spirits got a way of speaking when they want to,” she said softly. “They don’t always use words.”


I looked at her then. “You saying that wasn’t a dream?” She shook her head, just a little. “I’m saying some things don’t come for you until you step back where you belong to.” I waited for her to say more, but she didn’t. She picked up her coffee and rolled herself toward the table, leaving the rest hanging in the air.
I stood there with my hands in the sink, watching the water, wishing she’d just say it plain. But Grandma never did things that way. And somehow, that scared me more than if she had.


I didn’t sleep much that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt like something was standing just outside the house, waiting. Grandma’s radio was off, which made it worse. I laid there listening to the water lap against the dock and the house creak, telling myself I was being stupid.


Sometime after midnight I got up. I didn’t have a plan. I just knew Grandma knew more than she was saying. The way she talked that morning, the way she cut herself off. It sat in my chest like a stone. Her room was dark, the door cracked open. I could hear her breathing, slow and steady. I stayed quiet and went into the small sitting room instead. She kept most of her things there. Old drawers. Stacked boxes. Nothing locked.


I started with the dresser. Old letters, folded so many times the paper was soft. Church programs. Receipts. Normal stuff. Then I found the photo album. It was heavy, thick leather cover, worn smooth from hands. When I opened it, the first pages were what I expected. Black and white photos of family members smiling stiffly at the camera. Sunday clothes. Front porches. Names written in faded ink underneath.

I turned the page. The clothes changed. Older now. Dresses longer. Men in suspenders. The dates written in the margins said early 1900s. My last name was still there. Same blood. Same family.That’s when I saw it.


The pendant.


One woman wore it around her neck, clear as day. On the next page, a man had it tucked into his shirt. Then another. And another. Every few pages, that same symbol showed up again, always close to the skin. My hands were shaking by the time I reached the back of the album. Tucked into the last pages were newspaper clippings. Yellowed. Brittle. Headlines about men found dead, names matching the ones in the photos. I didn’t read too close. I didn’t need to. I knew what they were talking about. My stomach turned.
“What you doing in my things?” I nearly dropped the album. Grandma was sitting up in bed, her robe hanging loose, her eyes sharp despite the hour. “You know something,” I said, my voice coming out rough. “You’ve known something this whole time.” She looked at the album in my hands, then back at my face. Her mouth pressed into a thin line.
“Put that down,” she said. “No,” I said. “Not this time. You need to tell me what this is. What’s been happening to me.”


The room felt smaller then, like the walls were leaning in. Grandma stared at me for a long moment, fear flickering across her face before she hid it. Somewhere outside, the swamp shifted, slow and heavy. Grandma sat down hard in her chair like the truth weighed more than her bones. She didn’t look at me at first. She just stared at the floor, hands folded tight in her lap.


“This was a long time ago,” she said. “Back when the law didn’t see us as nothing worth protecting.” I didn’t interrupt her. She continued.“Our family lost three men and a lil boy,” she went on. “Taken right out the parish. Left hanging like warnings.” Her voice stayed steady, but her fingers shook. “It broke us. Folks were scared to leave the house. Scared to speak too loud. Scared to breathe wrong.”
She swallowed.


“One of the women back then, my grandmother, she couldn’t live like that no more. So she went into the swamp. Went where nobody else would. She prayed, but not to God alone. She asked anything that would listen to keep our blood safe.” My mouth felt dry. “And something answered,” Grandma said.


She finally looked at me then. “It promised protection. Said no more ropes, no more mobs, no more men taken before their time. But nothing comes free. That spirit wanted its due.” I asked it before I could stop myself. “What kind of due?” I said, still confused. “A hundred years,” she said. “That’s how long it would guard us. After that, the bargain was done. Whatever hunger it had would be loose again.” The room felt cold. I thought about the dates in the album. About the way the figures had pointed at me.


“The people I saw,” I said quietly. “That was them?” She nodded. “Your ancestors. They stayed close to the water after death. Watching. Waiting. Trying to warn you.” My chest tightened. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“I wanted to see you,” she said. “Wanted to have you here, safe, before the time was up. I didn’t know it would come so soon.”


Her voice cracked, just a little. “I thought maybe the spirit would pass us by. Maybe it already took enough.” Outside, something moved in the swamp, slow and heavy. Grandma reached for my hand, her grip weak but urgent. “You need to understand,” she said. “The protection is gone now. And it knows your name.” Grandma squeezed my hand hard, harder than I thought she could.


“You need to go,” she said. “Right now.”
“What?” I said. “No. I’m not leaving you here.”
Her eyes flashed at me. “That thing is awake,” she snapped. “And it’s hungry. My time already done. I lived long. You ain’t.” I went to her chair, tried to push it back. “I can get you in the car. We can-” She interrupted me. “Boy,” she yelled, loud enough to make me flinch, “get the hell out of my house.”
I froze. I had never heard her raise her voice like that. Not once in my life.


“It wants the blood still walking,” she said, breath shaking now. “Not the ones already half gone. If you stay, it’ll take you. If you don’t, maybe it won’t follow far.”
The house creaked. Something heavy shifted outside, close enough that I felt it more than heard it. “Go,” she said again. Softer this time. “Run.” I grabbed my keys and didn’t even think about shoes. I burst out onto the deck in my pajamas, the boards slick under my feet. The swamp was loud again, too loud, like it was breathing all around me. I ran. I’m not a runner. Never have been. My lungs burned, my legs shook, but I didn’t stop.


I made it to my car, hands slipping as I yanked the door open. It started on the first try. I didn’t look back. I drove too fast down the narrow road, trees whipping past. Then something jumped out in front of me. A deer. Big. Close. I swerved. The car slammed into a tree so hard my head rang. The engine is dead and smoking now.


I've locked the doors. My hands are shaking like crazy. Now I’m sitting here and typing this while I still can. I don’t know exactly where I am. Somewhere outside New Orleans, deep in the bayou. My battery is low. I’ve got barely any service. I can hear it out there. A deep bellow rolling through the water.


It’s getting closer.

1qhbxx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qhbxx3/when_you_are_treated_like_a_dog_will_bite/,"When you are treated like a dog, will bite.","I was nine the year the older boy hit me with the pipe.

Third grade, morning shift. Classes ended at 13:30 because the factory needed the mothers and fathers for the second rotation. Four kilometres of cracked asphalt and dust between the school and the block of flats. No buses; petrol belonged to the State. Children walked alone. That was the rule.

He stepped out from the poplars that lined the irrigation canal. Fourteen, maybe fifteen. Eighth-grade uniform, red Pioneer scarf knotted like a noose. He didn’t speak. Just raised the iron pipe—cut-off scaffolding, the kind we stole from collective farms to fix our balconies—and brought it down on the exact same place a guard in Siberia had once broken my grandfather’s skull.

I remember the sun flashing on the metal. Then the world went red. I stayed behind, watching him walk away without a care. Blood mixed with my tears, hands pressed to my head while I asked the empty air,

“Why? Why did you hit me? What did I ever do to you?” The feeling of impotence was overwhelming. He was too big, too strong. I cried because I could do nothing else.

I made it home by walking in the ditch so nobody saw the blood. Told my mother I’d fallen off the parallel bars. She looked at me once, saw the lie, and beat me anyway for ruining the shirt. The Party gave us one new shirt every two years, so I had really done it this time.

I never told anyone who did it. Informing was for dogs. Six years later I was fifteen. The country still wore grey, but the grey had begun to rot at the edges. The older boys were doing their two years of “patriotic service.” They came home on Sunday passes drunk with power and plum brandy, uniforms too big for the men they hadn’t become. I was buying cigarettes behind the bus station with coins I’d stolen from the factory collection box when I heard his voice—older, thicker, but the same laugh.

He was telling his friend they would meet two girls at the old path above the hidden beach. The path the border guards had stopped patrolling after the minefield was laid farther north. Thirty metres straight down to rocks and black water. I knew every stone. That was the place I grew up—where we hid to smoke, where we made campfires when the militia was someone we knew or just a lazy communist.

Hearing that voice reopened a wound that had never truly closed. That night the rage came back, colder than the day it happened. I remembered my mother’s beatings, and the scar on my scalp still ached. I went down to the basement, took the same kind of pipe (still there, still rusted, heavy and cold), and walked to the cliffs.

I hid just metres from the path, crouched in the bushes. Outside it was already dark, and a warm spring wind pushed the salty breath of the Black Sea into my face.

The girls arrived first, scarves pulled low, whispering about university exams they would never be allowed to take. They passed two metres from me and smelled of cheap lilac water.

A few minutes later the boys came along the same path.

I stood up behind them.

The first swing found the exact same place where he had scarred me. He dropped like a sack of maize. His friend screamed once—a thin, useless sound swallowed by the sea—and ran.

I hit until the pipe was soft with hair and the rocks underneath were wet. A strange feeling of freedom and relief surged through me. Blood boiled in my veins. I was not scared. I felt no remorse.

Then I ran.

It was 22:30 when I reached the block. Blood had dried into a second skin, but I hadn’t realised I was covered in it.

My mother opened the door, saw me, and dragged me into the kitchen by the hair. When she realised the blood was not mine, she went quiet—the way people go quiet before a storm.

Then she started hitting. Not slaps; closed fists, the way her own father had taught her after crawling back from Siberia missing four toes and all mercy. She used the wooden spoon the Pioneer committee had awarded her for “exemplary ideological education of the child.” She slammed my head against the walls. I felt warm blood running down my back. I didn’t defend myself—she gave me this treatment every week. I only hoped one day she would hit hard enough that I never got up again. Pain had lost all meaning. Life had never had any value for me until that night.

My father came in barefoot, eyes still red from the night shift. He tried to pull her off. She bit his wrist. He struck her once—the way men hit under communism when words are no longer enough. She fell between the table and the stove and stayed there.

The kitchen smelled of blood, coffee, and fear.

My father washed my face in the sink, water running pink into the drain.

“What did you do? Why did she do this? Tell me.” Fear I had never seen before was painted across his face.

I told him everything. The pipe when I was nine. The laugh behind the bus station. The sound the skull made when it finally gave.

He listened without blinking. Then he sat for five, maybe ten minutes, staring at the blank wall.

“Tell me exactly where this happened. Tell me everything again.”

I told him again. “Behind the last train station on line 201. Just fifty metres farther.”

“And the pipe?”

“I threw it in the garbage container at the station.”

He stood, carried my mother to the bedroom, closed the door, and came back.

“Shower. Put all the clothes in a bag. And go to sleep.”

I stood under the water until my skin wrinkled. I thought about the window—fourth floor, quick. Thought about the belt—quiet. Thought about swimming out until the cold took me and the militia wrote “accidental drowning,” the way they did for everyone who disappeared.

I decided the sea would be cleaner.

I never slept.

At 05:47 the front door opened again. My father came in alone. His boots left half-moon prints of wet sand and black earth across the linoleum. He smelled of salt, pine disinfectant, and something sweeter—the chemical they used in the morgue when bodies waited too long. He went to the bedroom first. Stayed a few minutes. I could hear him speaking low to my mother. He came out with his eyes empty.

He started the coffee. I walked in.

“No school today.”

I nodded.

“This is the biggest mistake you will ever make in your life.”

“I’m sorry, father.”

“Too late.” He lit a Carpați with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking. “His parents will never see him again. The army will write ‘desertion.’ Nobody will ever know what happened to him. You will never speak of this—not to your wife, not to your children, not in the confession booth, not on your deathbed. Never.”

He drank the coffee standing up, put on his factory jacket, and left for the morning shift.

Just another Tuesday under the red star.

Mother woke around noon.

She came into the kitchen without a word, face swollen on one side, the print of Father’s hand still purple across her cheek.

She lit the stove, put water for coffee, and sat opposite me—the same chair where she had beaten me hours earlier.

I waited for the screaming to start again. It never came.

Instead she stared at the cracked table and spoke so quietly I had to lean in.

“Your grandfather crossed a river once,” she said.

“January. Forty-nine below. The guards shot the dogs first so the barking wouldn’t carry. He walked on the bodies of men who had fallen before him. Ice broke. Water took his boots, then his toes, one by one. When he reached the other side he had no feeling left below the knees, but he kept walking because the Russians were still behind.”

She stirred the coffee and let her gaze drift toward the Black Sea through the thin window.

“He came home in 1954. Skinny, grey, eyes like holes. The first night he slept in his own bed he woke screaming that the guards were dragging him back. My mother tried to calm him. He beat her unconscious with the same fists that had carried him across the ice. Said if she was soft the Russians would smell it on her and come for all of us.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“I was seven. He made me stand in the yard in February with no coat until I stopped crying. Said tears freeze and give your position away. When I came inside he beat me with the belt for shivering too loud. Every time I flinched he said, ‘Good. Remember this feeling. It will keep you alive.’”

The coffee boiled over. She didn’t move.

“That is what they taught him in the camp. Pain is a language. If you speak it first, nobody can use it on you.”

She tapped the spoon against the cup. Tap. Tap. Tap. Like bones.

“I thought I was teaching you to survive,” she whispered. “I thought if I made you hard enough, the world would leave you alone.”

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not tears—she had none left. Just the sound of something inside her finally breaking after forty years.

“I was wrong,” she said. “The world doesn’t leave you alone. It just waits until you’re the one holding the pipe.”

She stood, walked to the window, and stared out at the grey blocks, the laundry lines, and the red star still painted on the water tower even though nobody believed in it anymore.

“Go to your room,” she said without turning. “Your father will say what needs to be said when he comes home tonight.”

I went.

That was the only time she ever told me about her father.

The only time she ever came close to an apology.

Later, when the regime fell and people burned portraits in the streets, I understood: the guards never left Siberia. They just came home inside the people who survived them.

And some of us learned the language so well we started speaking it to our own children.

Forty-three years passed. The regime died choking on its own flags. I married, had children, watched them grow up in a country that pretended it had never been afraid.

My father died first. Heart attack on the exact spot of the hidden beach where he once buried a boy. They found him face-down in the sand, one hand clutching a brown hat he had kept since 1956.

At the wake my mother pulled me into the same kitchen. She was eighty-three, thin as a winter branch.

“He wasn’t dead when your father got there,” she whispered. “Barely breathing, but the eyes were still moving. Your father pressed one heavy hand over the boy’s mouth and nose until the eyes stopped moving. Carried him farther down the cliff and covered him with rocks, sand, and quicklime from the collective. He went back three nights to make sure the dogs didn’t dig.”

She lit one of his old cigarettes with a match that trembled the way his hands had trembled every morning for forty-three years.

“He saw that boy’s face every single night until the day he died. Every night. Even after the wall came down. Even after they gave us passports and blue jeans and Coca-Cola. That face never left him.”

She inhaled until the coal burned her fingers. Then she stubbed it out on the same table where she had once beaten me for bleeding.

Three days after the funeral my mother placed a small wooden box on the kitchen table.

Same table. Same cracks. Same ghosts.

“Open it,” she said. “He wanted you to have this when I was gone too.”

I lifted the lid.

On top lay a yellowed newspaper from 1962. Front page. A grainy photograph of a young man in uniform, headphones around his neck, fingers flying over a Morse key. The headline screamed in red ink: BEST TELEGRAPHIST OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC – AN EXAMPLE FOR THE YOUTH!

His name underneath. My father at nineteen. The same eyes that could freeze a room without a word.

Under the paper: an Orex automatic watch stopped forever at 03:17. A stack of black-and-white photos. Father as a boy near the Russian border, barefoot in the snow, holding a dead hare twice his size.

Father in Moscow, 1964, standing stiff beside Red Square, medals he never wore again.

Father drunk at a wedding, smiling in a way I had never seen in life.

And at the bottom, folded small so it wouldn’t tear, the medical report from 1955.

I knew the story, but never the paper.

He was fifteen. Working the collective fields up north, near the Soviet border where winters eat men. A tractor turned too sharp. The driver didn’t see the boy behind. The blade caught him across the head and peeled the scalp clean off like the skin of an orange.

They carried what was left of him home on a door. The doctor told the family: “Prepare the hole.”

They dug it that same evening. Carved a wooden cross. Wrote his name, the dates 1940–1955.

Three nights later he opened his eyes.

He never spoke about the dark he saw. Only once, drunk on plum brandy when I was twelve, he told me the cold had felt like home.

After that he drank every day, but never raised a hand.

The anger lived in his eyes instead—grey, flat, impossible to meet for more than a split second. People crossed the street when he walked. Even the militia looked away.

He spoke Russian and French like a native, could solve equations in his head faster than the engineers at the factory, but he chose the dirtiest job on the line. Twelve-hour shifts, oil up to the elbows, far from any Party office that might remember the newspaper photograph.

He wanted to disappear.

The regime had made him a hero once. He spent the rest of his life running from the medal.

I turned the watch over. On the back, scratched with a nail decades ago:

Я ВИДЕЛ (Ya videl) I saw.

Mother watched me read it.

“He learned Russian in Moscow,” she said. “Six months attached to a signals unit. They taught him the language and how to hate it. When he came home he never spoke it again—except when he was drunk and crying in his sleep. Then it was always the same two words.”

She took the newspaper, smoothed it with her palm as if she could still flatten the past.

“He never hit you,” she said.

“Never. Even when you deserved it. Even after that night on the cliff. He carried enough for both of you.”

I closed the box.

That evening I walked to the cemetery. The grave was fresh, the earth still black. I opened the Orex, wound it once, twice. The second hand jerked, then moved. 03:17 became 03:18.

Somewhere under the soil he was still counting.

I left the watch on the mound. Let time keep walking for him now.

When I got home the wind had come in from the sea, carrying the smell of salt, pine, and something metallic underneath.

I stood on the balcony and listened. For the first time in forty-three years I heard two sounds at once: the pipe finding the exact same place, and a telegraph key tapping out a message no one would ever answer.

I go to the cliffs sometimes. The path is overgrown now. Tourists come for the view and never know that a young man lies dead beneath their feet.

I still wonder why he did it. What demons made him grab that pipe and break my head?

I know my demons sleep now, but they visit me in my dreams.

Are his parents still alive? Does anyone else still think of him?

Or am I the only one left carrying him?

When the wind is right I still hear it: the sound a pipe makes when it finds the exact same place twice.

Under communism we learned that some debts cannot be paid. They can only be passed on.

**Background**

There’s a tiger in that apartment. You know the one. You haven’t seen the tiger, but your neighbor says they did, and you heard the noises just last week, growling, pacing, heavy breathing like sprinters. Maybe you peeked in once, when the man left, saw the searchlight eyes sweeping the hallway, ran back to your doorway shivering. It’s no shame in that. Maybe you went a bit further, crept ‘round those cameras, climbed that tree, felt its breath heavy on your neck. billy woods did.

The son of a Jamaican professor of English Literature and a Zimbabwean intellectual, woods grew up in the 80s and 90s splitting time between New York City; Washington, D.C.; and his father’s native Zimbabwe. After woods’ father passed in the late 1980s, woods and his mother returned to Washington; he briefly attended Howard University before becoming connected to NYC’s underground rap scene. He met Vordul Mega, soon to be of Cannibal Ox fame, a younger artist who helped push woods into taking rap seriously. And in 2003, billy woods founded [Backwoodz Studioz](https://backwoodzstudioz.com/)



In 2003, woods dropped *Camouflage*, followed up a year later by *The Chalice.* Both albums got some quiet buzz and no real traction, nothing you could really hang your hat on. Through the mid-2000s, woods worked mostly within the duo Super Chron Flight Brothers, alongside fellow rapper Priviledge, dropping albums in ‘07, ‘09, and ‘10. But by 2012, woods was all but finished, and his closest collaborators were nowhere to be found: Bond had mostly retired, Vordul too; producer Marmaduke was a year or two away from his own exit from music; Privilege vanished shortly after Super Chron’s second album dropped. Back against the wall, woods recorded *History Will Absolve Me*, intended to be his own retirement project. Instead, it became a cult sensation, revitalizing Backwoodz Studioz, the NY underground, and woods himself. It also helped chart the path woods would follow moving forward: a deeper and more world-weary delivery than his earlier albums, a wider selection of producers and features, bitter comedy without the zaniness of *Chalice*.

From 2013 to 2025, woods released nine solo albums (six as full-length collabs with a single producer) and eight collabs with another vocalist: one with Moor Mother (2020’s excellent, acerbic *Brass*) and seven with E L U C I D as Armand Hammer. All of these projects feature masterful lyricism and razor-sharp insights into the places and people that woods has called home. Many of them have been hailed as among the best of their release years. A few - 2019’s *Hiding Places* with Kenny Segal and 2022’s *Aethiopes* with Preservation in particular - make frequent appearances on ‘best of’ lists for the 21st century. Yet woods has never quite attempted a project like *GOLLIWOG*.

Announced on March 12, \*GOLLIWOG\* was teased with ""Misery,"" produced by Kenny Segal, and the [album cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golliwog_(album)#/media/File:Golliwog_(album).jpg)



**Review**

Track 1: **Jumpscare** prod. Steel Tipped Dove

It’s just over 30 seconds before we hear woods’ voice. At first we just get droning, clicks and whirs like a busted money counter, the buzzing of dying honeybees, a wide shot of a car gliding alongside a mountain highway. Then that jangling melody, a lullaby gone wrong, and woods’ appearing 'round the Overlook great room column: *""Ragdoll playing dead/Rabid dog in the yard, car won't start, it's bees in your head.""* Hard to sum up this album much better than that.

Over the next two and a half minutes, woods lays out the thesis for GW, evoking everything from 1892 political cartoons to all the ways colonialism has poisoned the world (metaphorically and literally (don’t you eat that fish)) to that Afrofuturist Acura Legend time-traveling backwards. It’s a tour de force of lyricism, technical but not showy, direct without ever feeling abrasive. woods knows we can’t do shit about any of this, not in this economy. He probably can’t do shit either. Not a reason not to try, though. And I guess, when you reach the end of the road, all you can do is laugh and hope the soundtrack at your funeral sounds half as fitting as this.

Track 2: **STAR87** prod. Conductor Williams

Cows flying, animated kitchen utensils, shit’s hard to believe. Gotta be an explanation, but in this day and age, why bother waiting around to find out? This is woods at his pettiest, his most arrogant, the most DOOM-esque track on an album where he borrows entire hooks from the masked villain himself. He spares a moment to thank those that paved the way, but really, what are all these words going to do when it’s hungry ghosts around the coffee table? You made a buck, you betrayed a friend, and you’re going to complain about the looks you get when you come home? Yeah, maybe the call really is going from inside the house…

You won, though, no denying that. Too bad $1.2 million ain’t stopping that bullet.

Track 3: **Misery** prod. Kenny Segal

This was the first single, the first taste, the first time we got to really sink our teeth into \*Golliwog\*. Over a Kenny Segal beat as jazzy as anything on *Maps*, woods spins a tale of a doomed love triangle into a 2-minute treatise on celebrity and vampirism. And this isn’t 1922; we get to see all the gnarliest bits, breasts heaving, blood and spit mixing beneath the rising sun.

This is a tour de force of allusions, Stephen King’s eponymous novel giving way to DOOM’s gas drawls giving way to Toni Morrison and her doomed Sethe. woods knows he’s obsessed, but he also knows he can’t help but let it consume him. Some love is just too thick. ""Misery,"" much like its namesake novel, is brutal as an axe swinging at an ankle, and just as swift. But what a way to tease an album.

Track 4: **BLK XMAS** (ft. Bruiser Wolf) prod. Sadhugold

He just can’t help himself. Huge placement with billy woods, a track named after a legendary 1974 slasher flick, a Sadhugold beat best described as lurching? And he’s still going to get a Frank Gore bar off. Bruiser Wolf’s just that special. This is the first feature on the album, and, as with a few other features here, woods uses it as a tone setter, less fleshing out a concept and more setting a vibe. And what a vibe this is. Wolf takes us through the hood, every angle of it, from the *""grandmas in pajamas""* to the armed robberies and eviction notices. Nothing is sugar-coated, nothing is softened, and while Wolf and woods both see the humor in even the darkest situations, nothing here is ever really funny.

When woods does finally rap, he spins out a tale of a family kicked out right before the holidays, every detail razor sharp, a Wes Anderson frame in verse form (if Wes had grown up idolizing John Carpenter instead of Roman Polanski, maybe). As usual for this album, woods blends in allusions to the works of King and Bradbury (*""tent cities on the edge of town""*) with his own twisted visions, all off-kilter rocking horses and ultrasounds full of doom. It’s as bleak a story as he’s ever told, and all the more crushing for coming after Bruiser Wolf’s nasal-as-shit panorama.

Track 5: **Waterproof Mascara** prod. Preservation

Preservation, man. On an album with the guy produced ""Meet the Grahams"" (a truly demented beat that seems to have been produced by trapping the souls of Drake’s ancestors in a grand piano), this is my pick for scariest instrumental here, hands down. We’ve got what seems to be a woman sobbing, woodwinds fluttering, a few sparse drums beats to keep things moving. It’s empty like a gallows after a hanging, just the body spinning in the wind. It’s the right backdrop though, for what becomes the most intensely personal song on the project, split over three short verses.

Verse one opens on a bad miracle, flipping ""Houthi"" lyrics into something even more paranoid. Death lurks around even corner, and once you invite him in, no amount of polite hints is going to get him out. Verse two finds woods studying Slyvia Plath and dead slavemasters. We close the song on lucky number three, full of more *Hiding Places* callbacks, another story about a kid left somewhere kids were never supposed to be. In under three minutes, we get a portrait of how the woods we see today was shaped by his childhood, how his father’s ghost haunts every crevice of his life, how sometimes all you can do is hit it again off automatic.

Track 6: **Counterclockwise** prod. The Alchemist

Speaking of The Alchemist, he pops in for a quick horror show of his own. But where Preservation’s ""Waterproof Mascara"" sounded nearly(super)natural, Al’s vision is all ticking clocks and phasers set to kill. woods spits through the brain-fog of too little sleep and too many 25-hour days, unspooling one of the most dazzlingly technical verses on GW, dropping bars like *""I know she was a pro how she slid out the bedsheets/Grasping gasping fish, I slide 'em in the fresh grease/Spattering, sputtering epithets.""* Everything slots together neatly, precision cut, the gaps so thin you forgot where the dream ends and the waking world begins.

Track 7: **Corinthians** (ft. Despot) prod. El-P

[PremRock’s not wrong](https://x.com/PlanetPremRock/status/1925698039827636333)



And then, of course, Despot pops up for his biennial verse-of-the-year contender. Counterclockwise clockworks. Despot’s also on that callback ish, spinning his ""Versailles"" verse out into the rap equivalent of Jed Bartlett shouting ‘You get Hoynes,’ minus the starry-eyed liberal revisionism. God isn't sending any omens, and the only ghosts walking through that door are the unquiet. It’s just line after vicious line, no crying uncle, no mercy given.

Track 8: **Pitchforks & Halos** prod. Kenny Segal

Don’t forgot to tip your driver. Otherwise that time machine not going back to the future, you winding up skewered and strung up. Kenny Segal gives us the second of his three beats on *Golliwog*, a supremely eerie, shambling blend of car exhaust, steel cans, and foghorns. It sounds reanimated, stumbling out the DAW stitchlines visible, an angry mob of lesser producers crowding around the studio gates. Over this monstrosity, woods drops in for a few words, all alliteration and alibis, but even the shortest verses hide gold (see: *""the stirring words of dead revolutionaries who were wrong,""* a line with more material to unpack than some rapper’s entire albums). And best believe that every word is lived in, creased, rebuilt so many times the original is gone; don’t ever mistake this for just rhyming.

Track 9: **All These Worlds are Yours** (ft. E L U C I D) prod. DJ Haram & Shabaka Hutchings

If you needed a demonstration of why Armand Hammer are one of the greatest duos in hip hop history, look no further. The track opens on woods rapping four lines (and four lines only):

>

>

>

>

It’s a verse ripped straight off social media, a quick sketch of the violent rot technology has brought into every moment of our lives, carried by Amazon-branded drones. When E L U C I D follows that up, a pair of verses sandwiched between two hooks, the sense of decay is overwhelming. He imagines subliminal messages in his instrumentals, futuristic snuff films played on infinite loops to an audience of one, aged presidents frozen and mummified. And as the song finally crumbles into dust, a militant chant ringing out o’er the land, woods and E L U C I D sit silent in their reinforced bunker, eyes hiding beyond VR goggles, watching the world spin on.

Track 10: **Maquiladoras** (ft. Al.Divino) prod. Saint Abdullah & Eomac

The hand on the clock spins on. You might be able to slow it down for a moment, let the world fade for an hour, minute, second, but it keeps spinning. You see it half-glimpsed in mirrors, sand falling through a clouded hourglass, ads flashing past on that late-night subway ride, and it was always there, counting down to something you’ll never get a chance to see. Lines from tracks long past, reanimated, old friends you never saw again cause if you stayed you knew you’d never leave whole, cold nights when they dug the graves, whole scantron full of empty bubbles. And that lonely minute hand tick, tick, ticking on.

Time was never on our side.

Track 11: **A Doll Fulla Pins** (ft. Yolanda Watson) prod. Jeff Markey & Messiah Musik

When woods [announced ](https://www.brooklynvegan.com/billy-woods-announces-new-album-golliwog-shares-misery/)



The first half of the track, produced by Jeff Markey, sees woods fleeing a place he knows no good will come from, surrounded by people he can’t trust and would never want to. Yolanda Watson follows him up with what is, for my money, the most beautiful stretch on the album. As the horns swell, she hammers home the album’s central image: *""I'm a doll full of pins,""* just a tool whose pain is used to make others bleed. When we finally pick up the pieces, and Messiah Musik’s mutations fully infect those horns and those chugging snares, woods reveals the costs of this lifelong mistrust, in the form of an accursed doll, gnawing quietly at your door. You can build your walls up as high as you want, fashion them out of steel, but it’s all the same in the end. The bill comes due.

Track 12: **Golgotha** prod. Messiah Musik

MF DOOM’s ""Cellz,"" the tenth track off the villain’s criminally underrated sixth solo album, opens with a reading of a poem by Charles Bukowski: *""Born like this, into this/As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs.""* Here on ""Golgotha,"" we get our own glimpse at the reaper, courtesy of Ray Bradbury imploring us to *""flee death:""* if only it were so easy.

Over another dark, jazzy loop from Messiah Musik, woods gives us one of his longest verses on the album, all chess pieces sliding across checkerboards, lions in too-small cages, and one-stand-nights with Bukowski’s aforementioned broad. There are ghosts lurking behind every word, just waiting for woods to slip up, but he never does, the rhymes stacking up until there’s nowhere to go but through the factory roof. The closing verse, full of ghastly omens and poisoned nightcaps, reminds us that sometimes commitment is its own reward. It’s no going back no more, and once you pull out that whistle, you best be prepared to use it.

Track 13: **Cold Sweat** prod. Ant

Bad dreams are only dreams. The ending skit calling back to that *""old self dozing in an aisle seat,""* doppelgängers run amok. Alarm clock numbers blur and morph, and woods just laughing, knowing that shit fake. These nightmares all SVU, ripped from the headlines, interviewers pressing for soundbites and NBA commissioners gripping frozen envelopes. But you get the last laugh, face peeking through the gap between door and frame, landlord begging and pleading, tenant rights code improbable readings. Still wake up with the sheets clammy.

It felt so real though.

Track 14: **BLK ZMBY** prod. Steel Tipped Dove

There’s a bad moon rising, dragging the rip tides that drag ships under the waves. Money can’t buy you freedom from its gaze, roof or not, but while you’re here, might as well make the most of the time you bought. Stack up those African presidents, drill that oil, import that car from Germany, Japan, or ole Britannia. And when you find your family shambling 'round the house, skin green, mouths wide, just don’t question it. Don’t trust anyone except those dead slaveowners, faces so regal, frozen in time.

Track 15: **Make No Mistake** prod. Messiah Musik

It’s that little hesitation, stutter step back, double-cross-over move, the shit you used to do with your little brother in the driveway, boom-bap blasting out the speaker. woods knows what he’s doing, make no mistake. Shit’s not normal, man. Can’t lie, when it’s pen to page, he’s the best (let’s not argue). Been this way for a while, too, so long you can’t even remember how it started, just what was knocking, in your headphones or at your apartment door, when it did. And when that shit changes, old ways twisted and remade, *""indigenous mountain villages makin' coca paste,""* you just gotta know how to turn a profit. It’s a new world, even if those old day still haunt you, regret perched atop your shoulders like ravens on chamber doors, knock, knock, knocking.

Track 16: **Born Alone** prod. Kenny Segal

Nothing supernatural about this one. No vampires hiding behind mic stands, zombies ubering to corporate jobs, no time machines parked behind the crumbling mansions. It isn’t evil, just sad. Bodies laid to rest on tenement stoops, dishelved, shoes there for those brave enough to take them. And that’s how they tell, too, tags on little piggies so the pigs can read the names. woods going back in time just for a pep talk, leaving with wet eyes. History looping like ALC sampling cause years from now the scene repeats anew; mask on so the audience can’t see the tears. And when you tell the story, just remember, no caps spelling the man name.

Track 17: **Lead Paint Test** (ft. E L U C I D & Cavalier) prod. Willie Green

This is a time-honored tradition. The same billy woods posse cut industrial complex that gave us ""Body of Work,"" ""Fool’s Gold,"" ""Wonderful,"" and ""NYNEX"" is back with a new nightmare. We got E L U C I D kicking off the festivities (cause who else would?), his verse unspooling tales of generational bad luck, passed down like first-day-of-school clothes. He’s followed by Cavalier, whose pair of 2024 albums have catapulted him to the forefront of the Backwoodz roster. Cav pulls off his usual rhyme scheme sorcery, weaving together lines like *""These ain't pains, these the regular aches/My mom slaved cause she said ownership was breaking the chains/Me and my father's main bond was that day we cursed out pigs at our gate""* with references to Michael Jackson and Arthur Miller. Finally, we get woods, entering his own ancestral Hill House, locked doors swinging open on smoothly oiled hinges, once-crowded front yard now barren. The level of focus here from all three is astounding, each approaching the same story with their own unique eye for detail. Oh, and did I mention the song is backed by a Willie Green beat, with chops courtesy of DJ Mo Niklz? What a posse.

Track 18: **Dislocated** (ft. E L U C I D) prod. HUMAN ERROR CLUB

Ming the tiger died in 2019, having lived out his post-NYC life at Noah’s Ark Animal Sanctuary in Ohio. His time there was more natural than the apartment - other tigers, a pool, an open sky above him - but still, not quite home. A wild beast dislocated, cage bars there no matter how big the cage, roaring a warning, *""You can't come in here with me, you can't come in here.""* That’s why the face is covered, why he hides in the spotlights and phone cameras, why he has to stay out of reach. It’s hard to be located, to hear voices calling out in the forest and run towards them. Hard not to retreat inward, eyes nervously watching that apartment window, claws stretched out like time.

1qhbvza,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1qhbvza/my_dad_got_remarried_and_no_one_told_me/,My dad got remarried and no one told me,"Posting this here to get some perspective and advice from people who understand!

My dad and I have been estranged for 6 years. The tldr is: he exploded on my husband in front of my kids, was racist to my husband in front of my kids, and when I asked for an apology (2 months after the incident) he refused to apologize and it turned into an hour long fight in public. I had PTSD-like reactions to his behaviour (shock/unable to get out of bed/stop crying), which led to a wake up for me that I had been compromising myself my entire life to cope with his rage. 

My mom died in late 2017. She was very close with my husband and kids. The day I went to meet him for what I hoped would be a productive and healing conversation, he told me he was dating someone new.    Because of the way that conversation turned out, I have never met his new partner. 

I am VLC with my sister, who fully sided with my dad, and LC with my brother, who kind of stayed neutral. I felt betrayed by both, but I have tried to keep some contact for my kids sake. I would like a better relationship with my brother. I have given up on my sister. 

In 2023, he called me and left a message telling me he had sold his house and was moving to a distant city TOMORROW. Did I want to come by and pick up some things that my mom had bought my children? This upset me, because neither of my siblings nor he told me he was moving when clearly this had been planned for months. And no mention of repairing our relationship or his relationship with my kids, who he cut contact with. 

When I brought it up with my brother, he told me if I wasn’t talking to my dad why did I expect to know? We had an argument about it but we were able to resolve it and move on. 

However yesterday I went for coffee with my aunt, my dad’s little sister. We ended up having a deep conversation about family dynamics and it was really nice. As we left the cafe, she brought up my dad’s partner and told me she was “nice.”  I said something about his “girlfriend” and she corrected me and said “his wife; they got married.”

I was in shock, and asked her when this had happened. She looked squirrelly and started backtracking and saying she couldn’t remember exactly when it happened. I knew she was trying to cover for him and protect him. (During our conversation, she told me my dad was scared to reach out to me.)

Later via text she told me they got married in 2024. I have spoken to both of my siblings quite a few times since he got remarried. Neither said anything. My dad said nothing. 

I feel betrayed, again. I haven’t told my kids because they will feel rejected again and cry, again. I’d love your thoughts on this. 

Do I really have to ”no right” to know?

How do I talk to my brother about this? Is there a hope for our relationship?

Do I tell my kids? I feel like they’ll be retraumatized. They both miss my mom so much, and have felt rejected by their grandpa. 

I’m working through this slowly, but I would love outside perspectives from people who’ve been through something similar. ",1,1768846416.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

I've never taken any art classes and definitely not any on art history or criticism. I've been on my non-fiction reading renaissance these last couple of years and I've truly enjoyed exploring literary theory and critiques on my own. 

The crazy thing is I'm a tattoo artist. I've drawn (or tattooed) at least 6 to 12 hours every day for the last 6 years and have never so much as read a single book about art history. For Christmas one of my coworkers got me a fascinating book on the history of tattoos and their meanings and evolutions and I devoured it in no time. I think this is the year I want to explore and think more conscientiously about not just my own artwork in a vacuum, but art as a whole. 

In essence I want a good introductory text into the world of art history and critical theory, preferably with pictures because I don't like having my phone open while I read. Preferably something that doesn't only focused on Western art. IDK, I know that's a lot to ask for in one book, but maybe if an author has a series... I do plan on reading further in the future, but I've come to the sobering realization that even though I identify as an artist I actually know next to nothing about art itself. I'd rather start with a general overview and then let my interests lead where they may. 

I'm getting the impression (from a quick Google search) that it might be harder than I thought. Most general art history books look like basic coffee table display pieces, and I'm looking for more than just a picture and blurb. I want to go into the theory. I want to spend the day wondering why the curtains are blue (so to speak)!!!

Afterward, people can either leave, or stick around to socialize, most likely to talk about whatever they're reading. If there's a nearby park and the weather is nice, then everyone could go for a walk while chatting about their books. 

I'd like to start this group. I'd use meetup, but they want me to pay a ton of money to start a group, and that's stupid. I'm thinking we could start a facebook group, or a discord server.

* Specific Location in Florida 
* Business Concept & Vibe 
* Unique Selling Proposition (USP) 
* Target Demographics

* Florida-Specific Strategic Considerations (Seasonality; Hurricane / disaster readiness; state tax structure benefits...) 
* Management Structure 
* Marketing Channels 
* Document Tone & Depth

We currently live in Springfield, MO and have been planning a move for a while. We’re trying to decide between Minneapolis–St. Paul, Milwaukee, or KC, and we keep going in circles.

OUR PLAN WAS TO MOVE TO MPLS IN MARCH BUT WITH THE RECENT POLITICAL CLIMATE, WE AREN’T SURE IF THAT’S THE BEST DECISION FOR OUR FIRST MOVE. We love how to community sticks together and fights for others, but it’s also terrifying.  

A little about us:

	•	We’re 25, married, no kids (2 dogs and 3 cats🐾)

	•	I work in journalism and am interested in nonprofit, education, animal welfare, and creative work. My husband is interested in construction or landscaping.

	•	We value walkability, access to nature, good arts/culture, and a strong sense of community

	•	Progressive-leaning and hoping to live somewhere that feels aligned with those values

	•	We love cozy neighborhoods, coffee shops, live music, museums, and being outdoors

	•	Winters don’t scare us

Why we’re considering each place:

Minneapolis–St. Paul

	•	Strong job market, especially for nonprofits and creative fields

	•	Great parks, biking, nature access

	•	More walkable and urban feeling than KC

	•	Our hesitation: recent news, safety perceptions, and whether the quality of life matches the cost

Milwaukee

	•	Lake Michigan, beautiful architecture, strong arts scene

	•	More affordable than Minneapolis

	•	Feels underrated and charming

	•	Our hesitation: job market depth and long-term career growth

Kansas City

	•	Familiar, affordable, and comfortable

	•	Growing slowly in positive ways

	•	Our hesitation: feeling stagnant and less aligned with our long-term lifestyle goals

We’re not looking for perfection — just a place where we can build a calmer, more fulfilling life and not feel like we’re settling or constantly itching to leave again.

If you live in or have lived in any of these places:

	•	What’s daily life actually like?

	•	Do you feel a sense of community? Is it safe? Does everyone have each other’s backs?

	•	Would you recommend it for someone prioritizing quality of life over hustle?

Unfortunately, I can’t put on anything too overpowering and have been dabbling in skin scents. I understand that in being a skin scent, the perfume won’t last as long as other types but I was hoping for recommendations on what I could try, or what you all think of the ones I’ve tried. 

Here’s what I’ve tried so far (all have been tested on a 12 hr shift, and I always apply lotion before spraying):

\* **Phlur Vanilla Skin**: 9/10 ••• I put this on before work and was able to smell it on myself for a solid 8 hours. I could barely smell it when putting nose to skin at the end of my shift. I LOVE how the vanilla is almost spicy and isn’t too overpoweringly sweet. Seriously considering buying a full bottle of this. 

\* **DedCool Mochi Milk:** 6/10 ••• I first tested this on a vacation on the back of my hand. Left the store I was window shopping in and got a cup of coffee. My sister and I are walking down the street, I’m holding my cup of coffee in front of me, and we ask each other what the wonderful smell is. It’s the perfume. I went and bought a tester afterward, but putting it to the test at work, it completely flops. It smells amazing for the first 3 hours, then it disappears. By hour 4-5, I can’t really smell it on myself at all. But the first few hours, it smells SOOOO good. 

\* **Snif Vanilla Vice:** 7/10 ••• I like Snif, but every time I spray this on myself I HAVE to sneeze. This vanilla is solid and it’s probably the spiciest one I own, but Snif is so pricey when you break it down per ounce and it’s so hard to justify getting a bottle. Longevity for this one is moderate, I can smell it on myself for about 5 hours and then it’s really a nose-to-skin scent. I find that it sticks better in clothing. 

\* **Kayali 33 Yum Pistachio Gelato:** 9/10 ••• Controversial, I know, but this is the only full bottle I own (received as a gift from someone who knew I was OBSESSED with this scent). There’s just something about this perfume that gets me, and it has never leaned overly soapy or baby powder-like to my nose. It smells fresh on the initial spray, but the dry down is what I’m in love with. It’s sweet, but not too sweet, and it LASTS. I have to be careful with how much I spray (just 2 sprays and that’s it) because I feel like it’s so strong. I’ve worn it on shift a couple times and I could smell it on myself for 8 hours, becoming a skin scent beyond that. It REALLY stays in clothes. I just don’t think it’s the most appropriate fragrance for my job, but it’ll always have a special place in my heart and on my counter.

This novel is an M/M Romance novel focusing around a grumpy/sunshine trope.

Spice level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ 

Length: around 53,000 words

Tropes: Hurt/Comfort, Grumpy/Sunshine, Healing from Betrayal, Self-sabotage, Grand Gesture

POV: Limited Third Person

Owen Clarke's carefully constructed life shatters when he comes home early and finds his boyfriend in bed with someone else. Broken and numb, he spirals into a pattern of empty hookups, using apps like a full-time job just to feel something—anything—other than the hollow ache of betrayal.

Then he matches with Ben Moreno, a tattooed bar owner with long hair, a sunshine personality, and his own history of loss. Ben does the unthinkable: he texts Owen the next day. Not for another hookup—to get coffee.

What starts as ""just sex"" becomes late-night conversations, sleepovers that weren't planned, and the terrifying realization that Ben sees the real Owen—not the polished image he shows the world—and wants him anyway.

But Owen's self-worth is shattered, and when things get too real, he panics. One cruel sentence pushes Ben away, and Owen has to decide: keep hiding behind empty encounters, or risk his heart on something genuine.

Set against Portland's rain-soaked streets, The Restoration is about choosing vulnerability over safety, authenticity over image, and learning that sometimes the scariest thing is letting yourself be loved.

Here is two of my stories, one fiction and the other based on my nonfiction review blog



The Other Piece of Me 

Jontin had always loved art, even when he stopped. He loved it ever since his older sister bought him a coloring book as a toddler. When he thought of art, he thought back to that time. He thought of her. Life was something to be captured, he decided, was better preserved on paper. He drew, sketched, painted, took pictures of the simplest things–captured what people wouldn’t care to look at, even if he didn't have the utensils in hand. 

It was a shame when she had gone. Some say she ran away. Others say she went missing. But mother was worried. Ma would be in so much emotional pain praying she never yelled at Jyra that last time. Jontin remembered Ma and her would fight and Ma saying “That living person has a dead spirit, an evil spirit. Just draining your life away.” With Jyra crying, with anger on her face, running away. Maybe she would’ve accepted her boyfriend and she would’ve stayed. He remembered her cries, “My baby, Jyra!” while looking at her pictures of her as an infant. When Jontin had stopped art, he figured he’d pick it up again at a later date. If he ever felt the strength to. And that’s what brought him to the art museum today.

He would always come to the art museum as a kid to show his art to Mr. Miller, the museum curator. And he would buy things from him at his gift shop. Today, he returned after ten years from moving to a new town and wandered into the little gift shop inside the art museum to meet with Mr. Miller. He would come here for peace of mind when mother would argue with his sister and after she’d gone. Now, whenever he arrived, he would meet him with the same open smile that said along the lines of “Hey Mr. Miller, got anything new here for me?” Mr. Miller would return with a “Mr. Jontin, nice to see you, I may have something today. You just have to find out”. Mr. Miller would today return with an old vintage art photo that was once lost but is now found of a redheaded girl with an intriguing presence and something mysterious in hand. Jontin bought it without hesitation, as though it was something he’d been looking for for ages.

At home, he sat it against the wall on his desk. He took another gaze at it. And began to draw.

For days, Jontin couldn’t stop drawing. He drew and drew. Sketched and sketched. Painted and painted. Redoing the process if he needed to. Not until he got it right. 

Something about this artpiece he wanted to figure out. Each scanning, each gaze he made he’d tried to find meaning of what it meant. He tried to figure out what was in her hand. And why was she holding it? What was the meaning of her red hair? It felt like he couldn’t make ends meet. One minute, he noticed something, next minute he didn’t. So he thought maybe he didn’t. *Maybe I missed something.* 

Then nights passed. And one night, in one dream, he heard a woman’s voice whisper, *“Jontin.”* Jontin is shaken but cannot gather more information. When he wakes up, there is nothing. He goes back to sleep. And when he wakes up again, it is morning. He is preparing to make breakfast in his apartment. Drinking coffee when the phone rings. He receives the phone call to come to the museum with the art photo. He returns to the art museum the next day, hoping to find answers, but the museum has shut down, with caution tapes and signs and the looks of the beginning process of new construction. Only the art remains in his possession, leaving him uncertain whether the girl ever truly existed. 

Despite the ambiguity, Jontin is looking for the curator, but he isn’t let in until she arrives. 

Then the curator uses an AI capture on it, he finds out the art isn’t vintage and that it is a modern reinterpretation when the girl shows up, revealing to be his sister Jyra looking like a different person, but like the one in art. And shows him the original art, which is how he remembers but with a coloring book in hand. She begins to say, “Jontin–” But before she could finish, his shock led him to embrace her with a hug and she did the same. 

When she finally did explain, she explained that she came up with the photo with the art curator to eventually tell him that she had left because she needed to find her purpose in life, something different. Her and mother were having problems because she wanted to help people find their purpose in ways she didn’t get to as a kid. To escape the stifles of her past and met a new desire. Her boyfriend and the longing to build a family before she can no longer. She explained she had secondary infertility but she was pregnant prior to leaving home a decade ago. And her purpose, her desire now to help others persevere against any obstacles the way she did trying to escape an abusive boyfriend and herself. She explained that she was kidnapped and ran away. She ran away with her boyfriend just to go missing. What she now called, “a living person with an evil spirit that drained her life”, the way her mother once said. And she also returned as a surprise. A little girl with fiery red hair comes in the distance, which looks like braids that have been dyed. The little girl goes up to him with what looks to be reaching out with one hand before the other for a hug but she gives him what Jyra would have wanted. And that is the artpiece–the photo– and the photo turns out to be of her holding a mysterious book that would represent the past when he first received his coloring book from her. His love for art no matter how old or how new.

After the three of them, Jontin, Jyra, and Mr. Miller leave the building, with the construction workers preparing to tear it down. A sudden smoke in the air. 

Jontin has now learned that even the things lost can be found and returned, but especially people. And that you can find things in things that are new. A sense of being at peace comes with knowing that he has found clarity and a new clarity. A new purpose. To persevere.

I don't have a driver license, and I don't want to give away my social security number to an online company that I don't know to whom else they could sell that information.

We had an Essenza Mini for about 8 years until it finally died. We recently bought a Nespresso CitiZ, but we’ve been underwhelmed for the price — especially given the obnoxious noise level.

Our usage is fairly high — we go through about three pods per day on weekdays and 5–6 pods on weekends. Our favorite pod is the Firenze Arpeggio.

Drink-wise: my wife typically pulls two Nespresso lungo pods, stirs in honey, then adds milk. For myself, I usually make a classic “Red Eye”–type drink — about half a mug of black Pike Place/Pike Peak coffee from a Keurig, topped with one lungo Nespresso pod.

Given the cost of pods, we’re considering returning the $300 CitiZ and putting that money toward a true espresso machine instead.

As beginners, we’ve been looking at the De’Longhi Dedica Maestro, which is currently on sale for around $250. The idea would be to start with a pressurized basket — using pre-ground espresso most of the time for ease — while also trying freshly ground beans with an electric DF54 grinder (a manual grinder isn’t practical for us due to my wife’s hand strength), with the option to move to a non-pressurized basket later as we get more comfortable.

Questions:

Does this seem like a reasonable starting setup for beginners that still gives us room to grow?

Would the Dedica Maestro + grinder be capable of eventually working well with a non-pressurized basket?

What style of espresso or roast profile would best match the kind of drinks we’re making now (lungo-style, milk + honey drinks, and a Red Eye–style drink)?",1,1768845712.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1qhbjly,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Careerflow/comments/1qhbjly/how_to_format_your_internship_resume_when_you/,How to Format Your Internship Resume When You Have Almost No Experience,"Here's the uncomfortable truth about internship resumes: you're competing against other students who also have limited experience. The difference between getting an interview and getting ignored often comes down to how well you present what you do have.

The good news? Recruiters know you're early in your career. They're not expecting five years of work history. They're looking for potential, relevant skills, and evidence that you can contribute. Your resume format is how you make that case.

# Why Format Matters More Than You Think

Recruiters spend an average of 6-7 seconds on initial resume scans. If your format is cluttered, hard to read, or buries your strengths, you're done before they reach your content.

For internship applications specifically, format serves two purposes:
* **ATS compatibility** — Most companies use applicant tracking systems that parse your resume before humans see it
* **Scannability** — Recruiters need to quickly identify your education, skills, and relevant experience

# The Three Resume Formats (And Which to Use)

**Reverse-Chronological**

Lists experience from most recent to oldest. This is the standard format and what most recruiters expect.

* Best for: Students with relevant internships, part-time jobs, or substantial extracurricular leadership
* Why it works: Easy to scan, ATS-friendly, shows progression
* Use when: You have 2+ relevant experiences to highlight

**Functional (Skills-Based)**

Organizes content by skill categories rather than timeline.

* Best for: Significant career changers (less relevant for students)
* Major problem: Recruiters are skeptical of this format—it often signals you're hiding something
* Avoid for internships: Unless you have truly zero relevant experience

**Hybrid/Combination**

Leads with a skills summary, followed by chronological experience.

* Best for: Students and new graduates with limited but relevant experience
* Why it works: Highlights capabilities upfront while still showing context
* Recommended: This is often the strongest choice for internship applications

# What to Include on Your Internship Resume

**Contact Information**
* Name, phone, email, LinkedIn URL, portfolio (if relevant)
* No physical address needed

**Professional Summary (Optional but Recommended)**
* 2-3 sentences positioning yourself
* Include: your degree/major, career interests, key strengths
* Example: ""Computer Science junior at [University] with hands-on experience in Python and data analysis through coursework and personal projects. Seeking software engineering internship to apply problem-solving skills in a production environment.""

**Education**
* Degree, university, expected graduation date
* GPA if 3.5+ (omit if lower)
* Relevant coursework that aligns with the role
* Honors, scholarships, dean's list

**Skills**
* Technical skills: programming languages, software, tools
* Certifications if relevant
* Organize by category for easy scanning

**Experience**
This is where students struggle—but you have more than you think:
* Part-time jobs (even unrelated ones show work ethic)
* Volunteer work
* Club leadership positions
* Research assistantships
* Freelance or personal projects

**Projects**
* Academic projects that demonstrate relevant skills
* Personal projects (GitHub repos, apps you've built, etc.)
* Hackathon projects
* Include: what you built, technologies used, outcome/result

# Formatting Rules That Matter

**Length:** One page. No exceptions for internship applications.

**Font:** Professional and readable—Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica at 10.5-12pt.

**Margins:** 0.5-1 inch on all sides.

**File format:** PDF unless they specifically request Word.

**ATS Compatibility:**
* Single-column layout (multi-column breaks ATS parsing)
* Standard section headers (""Education,"" ""Experience,"" ""Skills"")
* No tables, text boxes, or graphics
* No photos or icons

# Turning Limited Experience Into Strong Bullets

The secret to internship resumes is reframing what you've done as relevant accomplishments.

**Weak:** ""Worked at campus coffee shop""

**Strong:** ""Managed daily operations during high-volume shifts, handling 100+ customer transactions while maintaining accuracy and service quality""

**Weak:** ""Member of coding club""

**Strong:** ""Collaborated with team of 5 to develop event registration web app using React and Node.js, serving 200+ student users""

**Weak:** ""Took data structures class""

**Strong:** ""Completed advanced data structures coursework including implementation of sorting algorithms, trees, and graph traversal with Python""

# The Formula

For each bullet point:
* Start with a strong action verb
* Describe what you did specifically
* Include scale/numbers when possible
* Show the result or impact

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

* **Including high school** — Unless you're a freshman, leave it off
* **Listing every course you've taken** — Only include coursework relevant to the role
* **Using an objective statement** — Replace with a professional summary or skip entirely
* **Fancy templates with graphics** — They break ATS and look unprofessional
* **Generic skills like ""Microsoft Word""** — Focus on technical or role-specific skills
* **One resume for all applications** — Tailor for each role

# The Bottom Line

Your internship resume is a marketing document, not a comprehensive history. Choose a format that highlights your strengths, keeps everything on one page, and makes it easy for recruiters to see your potential.

There was no bad blood so in the later weeks after that breakup I tried to chase him back (ikr? I was stupid, di na po ngayon), he just said na di pa daw time and kailangan namin yung break. Moving forward to a month or two? A friend of a friend spilled some tea that he was actually cheating on me months before the break-up (2 months before the official break-up we called it quits but within the day we reconciled), I was in denial, disbelief and angry pero I had to be quiet about it kasi nga di “nila” alam that I know (yeah, his best buds know about it and even family). 

Sooo time skip to last year, first contact namon after that fin and closure (no he never admitted to the cheating, I have receipts tho pero he doesn’t know that 🤭) he texted “Nasan ka” and I was shocked, LOL! After that first message, he kept on texting me whenever he’s in the city for coffee and just to hangout (literally just coffee, talking about life and whatever topic that comes to mind) I guess we’re friends now?

I sadly can’t post any of our messages/imessages kasi it’ll be a dead giveaway in the case he’s here. 

Last time, he really surprised me with his sweet gesture kasi we went to this friend’s birthday celebration, dapat di nga ako bababa pero ayun bumaba ako kasi we both were driving our own cars. We were just gonna greet and dip pero napakain kami, as we were lining up—he was in front of me, he was getting rice then all of a sudden he turned to me and handed his plate over and asked if tama na ba yun, I just nodded nalang kasi na gulat talaga ako mamsh, he always did that back then, tapos nung kukuha na ng ulam, inaantay niya ako and served me. Then instead of sitting with his mate, he sat beside me and then just went ahead and got us drinks. Not even asking. 

Lastly, in the middle of the night he asked me out to accompany him on an errand. Nag taka talaga kami ng mom ko nun kung bakit ako inaya niya rather than his siblings or yung jowa niya (yes, sila pa nung girl na he cheated on me with) so I asked him on the way kasi he picked me up sa bahay, alam niyo ano sinagot niya? “Kasi you just came to mind, naalala lang kita”. WTF is that?

So ano ba tong si qpal? I’m not relapsing, I’m over him—as soon as I caught wind that he was cheating, instantly gumuho na lahat nun. 

Up until present day, he still texts me to grab coffee, I do meet with him kasi nga it feels normal and he’s a great listener and di ko kelangan mag filter. One time I had to pick him up from the airport, and even tease him kung nasan jowa niya. Is this okay? I technically know it’s not but gimme all your honest opinions.

We had an Essenza Mini for about 8 years until it finally died. We recently bought a Nespresso CitiZ, but we’ve been underwhelmed for the price — especially given the obnoxious noise level.

Our usage is fairly high — we go through about three pods per day on weekdays and 5–6 pods on weekends. Our favorite pod is the Firenze Arpeggio.

Drink-wise: my wife typically pulls two Nespresso lungo pods, stirs in honey, then adds milk. For myself, I usually make a classic “Red Eye”–type drink — about half a mug of black Pike Place/Pike Peak coffee from a Keurig, topped with one lungo Nespresso pod.

Given the cost of pods, we’re considering returning the $300 CitiZ and putting that money toward a true espresso machine instead.

As beginners, we’ve been looking at the De’Longhi Dedica Maestro, which is currently on sale for around $250. The idea would be to start with a pressurized basket — using pre-ground espresso most of the time for ease — while also trying freshly ground beans with an electric DF54 grinder (a manual grinder isn’t practical for us due to my wife’s hand strength), with the option to move to a non-pressurized basket later as we get more comfortable.

Questions:

Does this seem like a reasonable starting setup for beginners that still gives us room to grow?

Would the Dedica Maestro + grinder be capable of eventually working well with a non-pressurized basket?

1qhbf8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1qhbf8x/how_to_actually_delete_social_media_without/,How to Actually DELETE Social Media Without Losing Your Mind: The PSYCHOLOGY That Works,"

Started researching this after watching my roommate's third failed attempt at quitting Instagram. Dude would delete the app, feel like absolute shit for 48 hours, then reinstall it claiming he ""needed it for networking."" Watched this happen with like half my friend group. 

So I went deep, studied what actually works from neuroscience research, behavioral psychology, addiction specialists. Turns out most people fail because they're fighting against their brain's wiring without understanding what's happening. The withdrawal is real, the FOMO is biochemical, and your prefrontal cortex is basically in a cage match with your limbic system.

Here's what I learned from the best sources, podcasts with actual neuroscientists, and people who've successfully done this.

1. Understand you're literally fighting an addiction designed by PhDs

Social media companies employ behavioral psychologists and neuroscientists specifically to make their platforms addictive. Variable reward schedules (the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive), infinite scroll, notification red dots. These aren't accidents. They're exploiting your dopamine system.

Dr. Anna Lembke's work at Stanford shows social media creates the same dopamine spikes as gambling or substances. When you quit, you're going through actual withdrawal. Irritability, anxiety, phantom phone vibrations, the works. This typically peaks around day 3-5 and can last 2-3 weeks. Knowing this helps because you're not weak or failing, you're experiencing predictable neurochemistry.

2. Do a proper digital declutter, not cold turkey deletion

Cal Newport's approach in ""Digital Minimalism"" is probably the most sustainable method I've found. Instead of dramatic deletion followed by inevitable relapse, do a 30 day detox where you remove all optional technologies. During this time, you're not just abstaining, you're actively figuring out what you actually value.

The book won the Best Technology Book award and Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who's never had social media. His argument isn't ""technology bad"" but rather that we've never consciously chosen how we use these tools. We just adopted them because everyone else did. The 30 day break lets you reintroduce things intentionally based on whether they actually serve your values. 

Most people realize they don't miss 90% of their usage. What they miss is specific: keeping up with certain friends, one hobby community, event planning. You can often get those benefits through less addictive means.

3. Replace the habit loops, don't just delete

This is where most people fail. Social media fills dozens of micro-moments throughout your day. Waiting for coffee, bathroom breaks, before bed, first thing morning, standing in line. If you don't consciously replace these habit loops, your brain will keep reaching for the phone out of pure automation.

James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" breaks down exactly how to do this. The book sold over 15 million copies and Clear worked with NFL teams and Fortune 500 companies on behavior change. His framework: identify the cue (boredom, anxiety, waiting), recognize the craving (stimulation, distraction, connection), and insert a better routine that provides similar reward.

Practically this means: keep a book on your phone for waiting moments, use a basic meditation app like Insight Timer for anxiety spirals (the app has 100k free guided meditations and doesn't have social features), have actual hobbies ready for evening hours. The Finch app is solid for building replacement habits because it gamifies self care without the comparison and infinite scroll of social media.

BeFreed is another audio learning app that's been useful for replacing scrolling time. Built by Columbia grads and AI researchers from Google, it generates personalized podcasts from books, research papers, and expert interviews on topics you want to learn about. You type in a goal like ""break my phone addiction"" or ""develop better focus habits"" and it pulls relevant insights to create a custom learning plan. The podcasts adjust to whatever depth you want, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, some people prefer the calm bedtime voice while others go for something more energetic during commutes. Helps turn mindless scrolling time into actual learning without the dopamine manipulation of social feeds.

4. Understand the ""time confetti"" problem

Newport talks about how we've shredded our time into tiny pieces, none large enough to do anything meaningful. Social media trains you to expect stimulation every 90 seconds. When you quit, you'll feel intensely bored at first because your brain has forgotten how to handle unstimulated time.

This is actually good. Boredom is where creativity lives. Dr. Sandi Mann's research at University of Central Lancashire shows boredom activates the default mode network in your brain, the same one active during creative breakthroughs and deep thinking. You need to relearn how to be bored.

Practically: the first two weeks will feel like time is moving through molasses. You'll think you're missing out on everything. You're not. You're just experiencing time at its actual pace instead of the artificially accelerated version social media created.

5. Handle the social pressure strategically

The biggest pushback I got when researching this: ""but I'll lose touch with people"" or ""I need it for my career."" Here's the thing, neither is really true but you need a plan.

For relationships: the people who matter will stay in touch through text, calls, or in person. Social media creates the illusion of connection while preventing actual connection. You're mistaking surveillance for friendship. When you quit, you'll quickly learn who actually values your relationship versus who just liked your posts.

For career/networking: depends on your field but most people vastly overestimate this. LinkedIn is different from Instagram or TikTok. You can maintain a minimal, professional only presence without the addictive elements. Set specific times (twice a week for 20 minutes) rather than constant checking.

6. Use implementation intentions for high risk moments

Dr. Peter Gollwitzer's research on implementation intentions shows that if-then planning dramatically increases success rates for behavior change. Basically: ""if X situation happens, then I will do Y"" creates automatic responses that bypass willpower.

Examples: ""If I feel bored waiting somewhere, then I will take three deep breaths and observe my surroundings."" ""If I feel FOMO on Friday night, then I will text three friends to make actual plans."" ""If I reach for my phone first thing morning, then I will do 10 pushups instead.""

Sounds mechanical but it works because it removes the decision point where you usually fail.

7. Track the benefits to reinforce the behavior

Keep a simple note on your phone tracking improvements. Sleep quality, focus duration, anxiety levels, number of real conversations, books finished, whatever matters to you. 

Research from Dr. Melissa Hunt at University of Pennsylvania found that limiting social media to 30 minutes per day significantly decreased depression, loneliness, and FOMO. Imagine fully deleting it. But you need to consciously notice the improvements or your brain will default to remembering only what you're ""missing.""

Most people report: better sleep, longer attention span, less comparison anxiety, more present in conversations, more time (obviously), less reactive emotionally. But these benefits accumulate slowly, so tracking helps you see the pattern.

8. Prepare for the identity crisis

Sounds dramatic but it's real. If you've been curating an online persona for years, deleting that can feel like deleting part of yourself. Especially if you got validation through likes and followers.

This is actually an opportunity. You get to figure out who you are when you're not performing for an algorithm. Dr. Sherry Turkle's book ""Reclaiming Conversation"" explores how constant connectivity prevents the self reflection necessary for identity formation. When you're always broadcasting and consuming, you never develop a strong internal sense of self.

The first month offline feels disorienting because you're used to external validation. Then something shifts and you start developing internal validation. You do things because you want to, not because they'd make good content.

9. Use friction to your advantage

If full deletion feels too extreme, start by adding massive friction. Delete apps but keep accounts. Turn phone grayscale. Use website blockers. Remove all notifications. Log out after every use so you have to manually log back in.

Nir Eyal's ""Indistractable"" has great tactics for this. He's a former gaming industry insider who designed addictive products, then felt guilty and wrote about defending against them. The key insight: making behavior 20 seconds harder makes it significantly less likely to happen.

Most people find that after adding enough friction, they realize they don't actually want to use social media. They just want the dopamine hit, which evaporates when there's effort involved.

10. Join the growing ""digital minimalist"" community

Ironic but there are non social media ways to connect with people doing this. Reddit has communities (though you're trying to quit that too probably), but there are also Discord servers, email newsletters, and local meetup groups focused on intentional technology use.

Knowing other people are doing this helps. You're not some weirdo Luddite rejecting progress. You're part of a growing movement of people who want technology to serve them rather than the reverse.

The success rate goes way up when you have even one other person doing it with you. Find an accountability partner, ideally someone you see in person.

Look, this isn't easy. Your brain will come up with incredibly convincing reasons why you need to reinstall. ""Just to check one thing"" is how every relapse starts. But if you can make it past the first three weeks, something shifts. You stop thinking about it constantly. You stop reaching for your phone every three minutes.

I'm leaving..,"Sludge was never a genre meant to be consumed, much less ranked or packaged for collective approval. Sludge is ruin itself. It's decay. It's the sound of something that doesn't want to exist, it's not friendly, it's hostile. It's born from refusal. From the bankruptcy of optimistic discourse, clean aesthetics, and the pathetic need for belonging. Sludge is nihilism in musical form.

The perspective of sludge is radically anti-cultural. Not in the juvenile sense of ""being against everything,"" but in the sense of rejecting the idea of culture as a product, identity as a showcase, and music as social currency. Sludge doesn't want to be understood, celebrated, or shared. It doesn't accept validation. It doesn't apologize. It doesn't want likes. It doesn't want to be on a playlist. It wants to rot.

Use Once and Destroy, this isn't an aesthetic metaphor, it's an existential stance. Sludge is the unique use of one's own flesh, one's own sanity, one's own anger. There's no reuse, no branding, no career. There is inevitable self-destruction. The absolute opposite of this infantilized contemporary scene, where everything needs to be explained, classified, compared, and legitimized by numbers or social media trends.

This ""little community"" of performative hipsters, who treat extreme music like a costume and debate sludge as if they were evaluating specialty coffee, isn't ""just having fun."" They're trying to sanitize something that only makes sense as a threat. When someone says, ""Don't take this so seriously, we're just having fun,"" what they're saying is: we need to adjust this to be more comfortable. Sludge was never comfortable. It was never made for entertainment. It was never meant to be shared with a caption in a post.

Classifying sludge on a popularity list is a grotesque contradiction. Sludge is attitude, it's pure hatred for humanity, not a curation by pseudo-metalheads who want to engage in intellectual masturbation. Sludge despises your opinion, it doesn't give a damn about your morality. From the moment you worry about ranking, engagement, or acceptance, you're already out. There is no such thing as domesticated sludge. What exists is boutique metalheads.

You want to enjoy sludge without paying the price of existential emptiness, sociopathy or self-loathing. You want the aesthetics of transgression without transgressing anything? Without discomfort, without loss? Fuck you!! Sludge doesn't accept that. Sludge is absence itself. It demands corrosion, deterioration, and self-destruction.

True sludge doesn't build identity, it dissolves. It doesn't create community, it creates isolation. It doesn't generate belonging, it generates repulsion. It exists precisely to spit on the logic of mutual validation, on this collective masturbation of ""we are alternative."" Sludge doesn't want to be alternative. It is the flaw, the remainder. What's left after all the social posturing has crumbled.

If you need to explain that it's sludge, defend that it's sludge, prove that it's sludge, or justify why you like sludge, then it isn't. Sludge doesn't present itself. It appears as a problem. And whoever tries to turn it into a cultural product is shitting on art, because they're doing exactly what sludge always set out to destroy.

This sub is literally the antithesis of sludge, you're the boutique punks who wear battle jackets to look rebellious, but was grandma who made it.

It's the most scatological and nihilistic genre that exists, and you want to give moral lessons? Cancellation lessons? What's politically correct according to the idiotic perspective of this social media generation? There is no morality, there is no political correctness, all that exists is rejection and inadequacy. The day sludge starts conforming to these moralistic idiocies, it ends, it loses its own lack of meaning. Sludge is controversial, it's immoral.

So fuck this sub. Fuck these idiotic trends. Fuck the childish need for validation, for consensus, for approval. You're not ""keeping the genre alive."" You're castrating it. You are sterilizing something that only makes sense while it's infectious. This subreddit is the antithesis of the genre. A disgrace.

Nothing dramatic, just two tired looking adults quietly deciding what to order.

They were doing that small couple thing where one person is slightly annoyed and the other person is trying to keep things moving. You could tell they had probably had a long day, and the vibe was heading toward a pointless argument over nothing.

The barista asked something like “Anything else?” and the guy turned to the woman and said, very calmly, “Do you want me to be right, or do you want us to have a good morning?”

She paused for half a second, exhaled, and said, “Good morning.”

And that was it. No lecture. No apology speech. No winner. They just ordered and stepped aside like the air had been let out of a balloon.

It hit me because I realized how often relationship fights are not about the topic at all. They are about pride, tone, timing, and the need to feel justified. In the moment it feels like “If I do not correct this, I am letting something slide.” But watching it from the outside, it was obvious that being technically correct was not the point. Protecting the mood and the connection was.

Since then I have been thinking about how many times I have burned an entire evening just to prove a point that did not matter two days later. Not even big issues, just tiny friction that turned into a full argument because neither person wanted to back down first.

That one sentence felt like a reset button. Not in a fake “ignore problems” way, but in a “pick the right time and stop treating every moment like a courtroom” way.

I would really appreciate it if you can help out a noob. Let me know what would be the right choice. Do suggest something else if you think that'd suit me better",1,1768845015.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

....................................................................................................................................................................

Carla is gone… 

… and soon, so am I.

They were right. It was Mr. Jangles. Just three days ago, he was nothing but a story for me, a myth people told each other when the lights went out. Or like I said - a lie. 

The next day, he became a real. 

And now, he’s going to be the thing that kills me.

I don’t know how much time I have left. If this message cuts off - if it just ends - then assume the worst. Assume I didn’t make it.

I’m not writing this from the safety of my rented room anymore. I’m somewhere else now. I think I know where… I can tell it by the smell. You could practically taste the wet soil, and I can feel the dirty water drip on my legs. There’s no reception here at the moment. None at all. So I don’t even know if this update will ever reach you. But if it does…

Never come to Maywood Mills. 

Not out of curiosity. Not out of pity. Not because you think you’re smarter than me. Stay. The hell. Away.

I'm going to type this out as fast as I can. I’m cold and running out of oxygen. My hands won’t stop shaking. This will be my final update. And I’ll tell you everything I can - everything I’ve figured out - while I still can.

…

That night, I stormed back to the bar.

The regulars were exactly where I’d left them - hunched over their drinks like barnacles clinging to a shipwreck. The jukebox wheezed out the same tired country song. Same dull eyes were staring into half-empty glasses. Nothing had changed for them...

But everything had changed for me.

The handyman - who I'd find out was called Mickey - and Horace were at their usual table. Still soaked from the rain. Mud caked their boots, and their coats dripped onto the floor like the storm had followed them inside. They hadn’t been back long. 

I didn’t waste time. I slammed Carla’s badge down on the table, hard enough to make the glasses jump.

“Where is she? I know she's been here.”

Mickey didn’t look up. He just stirred his whiskey like he hoped to find another one of his dirty lies swirling at the bottom.

“Speak godammit!” I yelled. He just downed his drink.

I opened my mouth to press him further - then I heard it. Chairs creaking. Boots shifting on that god-awful sticky wood. The bar had gone quiet. Everyone was watching me.

Mickey finally spoke, slow and gravelly, like I was interrupting something important.

“Yeah,” he said. “She came through. Dale saw her. She said her phone was dead. Needed a charger. There are no phones here, so we told her what we tell everyone - the next town's a few miles south. She drove off. That’s it.”

“That’s not it. I heard your friend here speaking to his wife the other day.""

""Landline."" Horace muttered with a cheeky grin.

“You’re withholding information from a federal officer!” I snapped.

Now he looked up at me, and smiled.

“And what are you gonna do about it…” he said. “Call backup?”

I froze. I didn’t know what to say. I guess authority only works when someone believes in it. The room seemed to lean in. 

“I want to talk to Dale,” I finally said. “Where is he?”

Behind me, Lucy’s voice cut in, cold and flat.

“Dale’s dead.”

I turned. Lucy was standing in the doorway, arms crossed, eyes grave.

“Mickey and Horace just found him. Down by the dam. A Western rattlesnake got to him, we think. He fell in and drowned.”

“What?” My voice cracked. “A rattlesnake?”

She didn’t answer. She didn’t have to. 

I could feel it now - that heaviness in the room - the thing I’d mistaken for hostility - it was grief. Every eye was on me now. The stranger. The outsider.

A low-life trucker in the corner eyed the mud on my boots.

“No, I’m not joking,” Lucy said, sharper now. “Come on.”

She led me down the back hallway. Past stacked chairs and crates of liquor. Even here, the smell of bleach stung my nostrils. She opened the cold room door. And there he was…

Dale.

Pale. Bloated. Draped across a table like a shot deer. Dirty water slid from his fingertips, dripping onto the tile below. I just stood there, listening to the drops. I couldn’t move. My breath got stuck somewhere high in my chest. The air felt thinner, like the room was closing in on me. 

“You’ve never seen a dead body before, Agent?” Lucy asked.

“Of course I have.” I said.

It was a lie. I’d seen bodies in photographs. In reports. In situations where you could look away. This was different... it made me sick.

“You’re soaked.” Lucy said, gently now. “You’re going to get sick.” She put a hand on my back. “Let’s get you to bed,” she added. “I’ll bring you some tea.”

There were only a few hours left until morning. I didn’t sleep through a single one of them. I lay there staring at the door, waiting for it to open. Waiting for him to come for me - just like he must’ve come for Carla... and Dale?

That was another thing that I couldn’t shake. The note on my door.

Did Dale write it? Did he want me to meet him there? Or was it Mickey? Horace? Was the note meant as... bait? A colder thought crept in. What if they’d mistaken Dale for me in the dark? What if that’s the reason he was dead?

The idea settled in my gut and refused to leave. Another death I could trace back to myself. I was up to three now. My mistakes were starting to stack up. I was practically a serial killer.  Yeah… try sleeping with that on your conscience.

The next morning, I was invited to a town meeting. 

Dale’s death had rattled everyone. The room buzzed with anger - whispers, accusations, fingers pointing at me, eyes scanning me up and down. More than a few people asked if Mr. Jangles had something to do with it. Apparently, he hadn’t “taken” anyone in a while. 

“Except Carla”, I thought. I didn’t say it out loud. I was afraid of what would happen if I did.

I knew I wasn’t welcome anymore. I could feel it in the air. I was the outsider who’d brought trouble with him. That stirred their fucked up idea of peace. Heads turned toward me. Angry eyes glared at me. Voices sharpened. If Holly hadn’t stepped in - put herself between me and the crowd - I think they would’ve run me out of town right there.

The strangest part was how rehearsed it all felt. The outrage. The fear. Even the blame. It was like they were all reading from the same script. Like the meeting wasn’t about Dale at all - but about turning me into the problem. About making sure I packed my bags and left.

And if it wasn’t, if it was all genuine - would people act this way toward an FBI agent? Or had they all decided I wasn’t one? Either way, one thing was clear…  The clock wasn’t ticking for me anymore - it was counting me out.

I had to act fast.

Outside, I ran into Cherry - the girl from the school. I asked her how she was doing. She shook her head and took a step back.

“I’m not allowed to talk to you anymore,” she said.

“Did your mother teach you not to talk to strangers?”

""She taught me not to talk to you..."" she giggled. She glanced around, then whispered, “I have to keep Mr. Jangles’ secret. If I don’t… you’ll vanish too.” Then she ran.

I’ll vanish too… 

The words stuck with me. Was my gut right? Had I finally brushed up against some kind of truth? The story... The god-awful lie everyone here agreed to live inside. But if that was the case, the work felt impossible. I mean, how can you sniff out the truth in a place built on lies? I came here to find justice for Nadine, but can justice even exist in a place where lies have become the law? Where pretending not to see is the price of survival? Does the truth just rot - quietly, patiently - the same way Nadine did? In the same way all those people vanished. Out in the open. While everyone else looked straight past it.

For the first time, I didn't know what to do.

With my car still out of commission, Lucy offered to drive me to the nearest train station. Said they’d have someone else finish the repairs and tow the car to me once it was done. All she needed was my address. 

Let me tell you, something about giving it to her didn’t feel right. 

At the time, I told myself it was just paranoia. Another symptom of too little sleep and too many unknowns. But then something else awakened in me... something I said last night in the bar, tangled up with an unhealthy dose of stubbornness...

A need to make things right.

Now, lying here in the dark, I realize I should’ve taken her up on the offer.

But I didn’t. I was too close. Close enough to feel the truth breathing down my neck. So I decided to stay.

That decision came from a hunch - something I couldn’t shake. The phone call I’d made back at the police station. The one I’d almost written off as nothing. A landline? Come on. Really? I just needed to be sure…

So I broke in.

As the evening fell over Maywood Mills, I waited until Horace left. Then I said “fuck it” and put my elbow through the back window of the police station. The glass gave way with an ugly crack. I climbed inside and peeked back out into the street - the coast was clear. No shouts. No lights came on. I turned my attention to the station…

…and there it was. Lying by a charger next to a humming fan… Carla’s phone. 

The screen lit up when I touched it. Her lock screen stared back at me - Carla and her daughter, cheek to cheek at the Grand Canyon. My throat tightened. I felt nauseous. Swallowed it down. 

Every message I’d sent her was there. Every missed call. Dozens more from her fiancé. I checked her notes - I wasn’t sure how long she’d been here before Mr.Jangles took her, but maybe she’d been here long enough to see something I hadn’t. She was better at this than me... always had been.

She'd made a note 4 days ago. The day before I arrived.

*Havers, 1998.* But before I could make sense of it, I heard something outside.

Keys.

I froze and slowly turned toward the door. Then I heard the unmistakable sound of metal sliding into metal. 

His keys entered the lock.

I didn’t think. Didn’t hesitate. I shoved the phone into my pocket and bolted for the broken window. Glass bit into my palms as I hauled myself back out. The last thing I heard was the door creaking open behind me. I didn’t look back. I ran as fast as I could to the elementary school, and with a little courage left in the tank... 

I busted my second window of the night.

Lucy had told me most of the locals still clinging to Maywood Mills had gone to school with Nadine - that they’d all been in the same class. But I’d never heard of this boy, Lyle. Not once.

The school itself was… unsettling. Not because it was falling apart (though it was), but because of what filled it. Crayon drawings of Mr. Jangles lined the halls. Taped to the walls. Hanging on classroom doors. Kids holding his hand. Him dancing in the woods. Him picking flowers by the creek.

It almost felt like… curriculum. Suddenly, the idea of a cult didn’t seem far-fetched. It felt practical. Organized. Something taught young enough that no one thought to question it. Maybe this was it...

I made my way to the teacher’s lounge - though calling it a lounge was generous. It looked more like a college dorm kitchen that had been abandoned mid-semester. Burnt coffee hung in the air. Unwashed dishes in the sink. One sad, stained microwave in the corner.

In the back, I found a tall metal filing cabinet. And there they were.

Thick, dust-covered yearbooks. The kind schools used before everything became digital. Nadine’s murder happened late summer, which meant she’d still be listed in the 1998 edition. 

However, it wasn’t there. It was gone. 

The closest book I could find was from 2000. I flipped through page after page. The photos were sun-faded and grainy, and most of the kids looked like they had a gun to their heads. Still, a pattern started to form.

Lucy. Mickey. Horace. They were all there. All old classmates to Nadine. But Dale? He wasn’t listed anywhere. Instead, there was a boy who looked just like him.

Lyle Havers.

The pieces clicked together with a dull, sinking weight.

Dale was Lyle. But if that was the case, then why change his name? I worked myself backward through the books. Lyle wasn’t in ‘97 or ‘96 - but Nadine was. That meant he’d moved to town sometime between ‘98 and ‘99. Probably 98 since Carla had flagged him as a person of interest. 

Was there a story here? New kid arrives. Falls for the girl next door. Gets rejected. Heart breaks. Cue violent end. Maybe he’d been a suspect back then. I couldn’t remember his name from the case files - but given how sloppy they were, that didn’t mean much.

Still, the question lingered. Why change his name?

Because the evidence probably didn’t stick, however, suspicion does. I’d seen it before. Changing your name doesn’t erase the past - but it does bury it.

Then something else surfaced. A memory from the missing files Horace had given to me. One of the elderly couples. They were named the Havers. Ruth and Earl Havers. They vanished in 2003. I snapped a couple of photos of the pages, hands shaking slightly. Couldn’t tell if it was cold or something closer to excitement. 

That’s when I heard it.

…a faint clatter of metal, echoing down the hallway.

I froze. Didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just listened. How the hell did he know I was here?!

I slipped out of the lounge. If I remember correctly, the exit was on the other side of the hallway - the one lined with kids' drawings… because that’s just what I needed. More of him.

I moved through the corridor as quietly as I could. Then I felt it again - that strange pressure in the air, like the building itself was swallowing sound. I glanced out a window. Silent lightning bloomed over the woods. No crack. No wind. I turned back toward the hallway - 

\- and almost screamed.

Down the far end of the corridor - illuminated only by moonlight - stood a figure. Tall. Perfectly still.

Mr. Jangles.

Lightning flared again, carving his silhouette out of the dark. The top hat. The long coat. The wide, awful smile. With the next thunderboom, he started to dance. It wasn’t ballet, like last night. This dance felt wrong. It was off-beat. Childish. Unpredictable. Like someone mocking the very idea of what makes dancing beautiful.

But I was spellbound...

My blood turned to ice. Every scrap of anxiety I’d ever carried dumped into my veins at once. He was coming closer. I imagined this was what small fish felt like when they finally realized the beautiful light belonged to a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth.

His long, gaunt hand reached out for me.

Lightning cracked outside again, this time I heard it, and the spell broke. I ran. Full sprint. Blind through the dark. My boots hammered against the old linoleum, loud as gunshots. I didn’t know where I was going - just away. Anywhere else.

I rounded a corner too fast, slipped, and fell on my broken arm. The snap echoed off the walls. I bit down hard, choking back a scream. Fumbled for my painkillers. Swallowed more than I should’ve, dry. When the pain dulled enough for me to function, I forced my eyes open.

I saw lockers. Tall, metal lockers lined the wall. I didn’t think. I yanked one open, shoved myself inside, and pulled the door shut. The metal clicked softly.

Then, silence fell. All I could hear was my own breathing. Through the narrow slats, I watched the hallway. My heartbeat thundered in my ears.

Then a horrible sound filled the silence - keys scraping against metal. He was dragging his keys against the lockers. One by one. I could hear him getting closer. I did my best not to move and held my breath. My sweat ran cold down my spine. My arm ached with pressure.

Then, he paused. Just a few feet away. Just like that. No sound. No final scare. And then... he was gone.

I don’t know what came over me. I should’ve stayed hidden. Slept in there until morning. But how do you explain that to a kid? A grown stranger passed out inside a school locker? No, I had enough trouble as it was. I ran back out. Out of the school, into the night, and I didn’t stop until I couldn’t see the building anymore.

As I was getting close to the bar, I fished Holly’s number out of my pocket and called her. As soon as she answered, I blurted out some adrenaline-fueled theory. I can’t remember exactly, but I think I said something about Dale, or Lyle, having killed Nadine that summer. How the kids must’ve covered for him, and as they got older, they got rid of anyone who sniffed out the truth. Even his parents. Then they blamed it all on Mr. Jangles… and created a lie that now everyone has accepted.

It didn’t really make sense, but I was desperate for answers. This was all I got. But why would the entire community get together to protect one disturbed kid? Wouldn’t you just want to get rid of him?

I couldn’t think about it anymore as a strong smell hit me…

Burning wood.

I looked up and saw thick black smoke curling up into the sky, swallowing the treetops. The bar was on fire.

By the time I got close enough to see through the smoke, it was already too late. Flames licked the walls and gutted the windows to my room. Glass exploded onto the street. The old neon sign took its last breath and flickered to death. I ducked behind a dumpster, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. And that’s when I saw Lucy - sobbing. On her knees in the gravel, her arms streaked with soot.

People from the town had gathered around. They didn’t look scared - they looked furious. Their faces twisted with grief and firelight. And they were shouting… shouting my name.

They were hunting me.

I slowly backed away and ran down the street. There was only one place left to go.

Holly's house.

She took me in without a word. I must’ve looked worse than I felt - soaked to the bone, shaking. Half from the cold. Half from fucking everything else I'd been through. She handed me a mug of hot coffee and told me to sit tight. Said she was going to take a quick shower. That I could rest in the basement if I wanted. Lock the door, if it made me feel safer.

I nodded.

Finally, I had time to think. What was next? Everything I owned was gone in the fire.  All files, all my equipment... all my personal belongings. I was just about to head downstairs when I remembered - I had something - Nadine’s diary. It was tucked into the inner pocket of my jacket. I pulled it out. It was damp around the edges, but intact. It was all I had left of her.

I sat down and flipped through it. The first pages were what you’d expect from a teenage girl. Crushes. Classes. Doodles. Fights with her mom. Song lyrics. But then I hit something else.

Pages and pages written between April and August ‘98. At first, it looked like a creative writing exercise. A story she made up for school. Something about a man in a tall hat who lives in the woods.

Mr. Jangles.

At first, he was harmless. A story Nadine made up for a class exercise. A monster that only existed on paper. But as the entries went on, her tone changed. She wrote about how the other kids became fascinated with him. Obsessed. Lucy especially. And another girl - Anna Havers.

Anna Havers... Lyle had a sister?

I didn’t recognize the name. I couldn't remember her from the school photo.

Nadine explained that Lucy and Anna liked the idea of Mr. Jangles. So they started adding details. Drawing him. Talking about him like he was real. Like they could hear him. Then it stopped being a game.

In the middle of summer, Nadine wrote that Lucy and Anna had convinced the others to hold small rituals. Meeting at the creek. Praying. Leaving offerings. Talking to him at night. Nadine wanted it to stop. She said that she was scared. That she tried to tell the others that Mr. Jangles had left town. But they didn’t believe her. And then I found the last entry she ever wrote:

*Lucy and Anna asked me to come with them tonight. My mom has told me not to hang out with Anna... she told me she's being homeschooled because she's... special.*

*Anna says he wants to see me. That I’m the only one who can do this right. Because I know him and because he listens to me.*

*The other children have decided to sneak out tonight too. Everyone will be there. They’ve already decided on the forest. The place by the creek.* 

*I tried to tell them he isn’t real. That he never was. They accused me of lying. That I was just scared to admit the truth.*

*Now they want to see him. He'll only come if I'm there. They say it’s not dangerous. That nothing bad will happen.*

*I don’t want to go. But I’m afraid of what will happen if I don’t.*

*If something happens to me, I want it to be known -* 

*I never believed in him.*

*They did.*

Who was Anna Havers? Who came to Maywood Mills later… and didn’t keep her name? It dawned on me. I didn’t want the answer. I tried to push it away. But it was already there, waiting.

Holly.

That was the last clear thought I had before the sharp pain exploded at the back of my head… and everything went black.



I woke up here.

At first, I could hear them. Voices, somewhere above me. Muffled. Angry. Arguing, maybe. Then… the dirt. Or... not dirt. It must've been mud. Thick and wet and heavy. It slid over my casket like wet cement. I screamed. Begging for them to stop.

And then… I heard it. The dam. Cracking like a gunshot in the distance. And then a sound like the sky tearing open. Rushing water. Flooding everything. Washing over my grave. I can only assume that’s what I heard when I arrived three days ago. That they buried Carla...

Her body was probably just a few feet away. Dale’s too… He left me the note because he was ready to talk. To confess. Ready to tear open the lie that had been holding this town together for decades.

They couldn’t let that happen.

I don’t know how deep down I am. I can’t move. The walls are tight and pressing in on all sides. My ribs ache every time I try to breathe. 

Please. Don’t get any ideas… don’t come look for me. They’ll find you.

He’ll find you.

I’m writing this on my phone - which they forgot to take from me for some reason. So, if they somehow remember, I assume they’ll come back for it. But I’ll be long gone by then. So, if you hear an update from me again… please now, that it won’t be from me.

They say small towns hold onto their stories longer than they should.

And Mr. Jangles?

His story will be safe with me.

I want to step up my coffee experience, as I am currently using Dolce Gusto pods. I found a listing on a local p2p marketplace in Europe for the Sage (Breville) Touch Impress SES882BSS for 800 EUR. I’ve watched a lot of reviews and I think this is the perfect machine for my use case, and this one apparently includes cold brew options as a 2025 model.

The machine is brand new and unopened, but my only concern is that it’s being sold without a warranty. The seller says it was purchased abroad and that they don’t have a copy of the receipt, which I’m not entirely sure I believe. The seller is reputable, but I’m unsure whether I should worry about the missing warranty or go ahead with the purchase.

The retail price here is around 1300 EUR, so this offer is significantly cheaper. What would you do in my position? Thanks in advance!",1,1768844919.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

The Mumbai rain fell in relentless sheets, drumming against the floor-to-ceiling windows of their Bandra apartment. Bhagyashree stood by the balcony door, arms wrapped around herself, watching the city blur into gray. It had been exactly one year since the day Rishabh had stood in front of her, his voice cracking as he put a ring on her finger and said, ""I choose you every single day, Boss Ma'am. Flaws, fears, all of it."" They had gotten married privately with no grand ceremony, just them, their fathers, a simple mangalsutra, and promises whispered like secrets.

Yet some shadows lingered.

She heard the front door click open, then the soft thud of his shoes being kicked off. Rishabh appeared in the hallway, soaked through, and his hair plastered to his forehead, white shirt clinging to his broad shoulders. He carried a paper bag from her favorite South Indian place in Andheri, the one that still made filter coffee the old-fashioned way.

""You're late,"" she said, voice quieter than she intended. Not accusatory but just tired.

""Traffic. And I stopped for extra sambhar. You said last week it was too runny."" He set the bag down, peeled off his wet jacket, and hung it carefully. His eyes searched hers, always did. Its like he was still proving he would never disappear.

Bhagyashree turned back to the rain. ""Naysa's lawyer called the office today. Said she's appealing the last judgment. Something about new evidence.""

Rishabh froze. The name still carried weight, even after everything although Naysa's schemes were exposed, her obsession dismantled in court, her final defeat when the truth about Gautam's framing came out. But some old wounds didn't heal clean.

He stepped closer, not touching yet. ""Shree … I handled it. My team already filed the counter. It's noise. She has nothing left.""

Bhagyashree's laugh was brittle. ""She always finds something. And every time something from the past resurfaces, I wonder if she will""

""If she'll, what?"" His voice sharpened, hurt flashing across his face. ""If she'll make me go back to her and be a man who lied to you? Who used you to hurt your family because I thought you hurt mine?""

She spun around, eyes glistening. ""You almost did ruin me, Rishabh. You came into my life with a plan. I fell in love while you were plotting revenge. And even after you chose me… sometimes I still feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.""

The room went silent except for the rain.

Rishabh closed the distance in two strides, gently cupping her face. His thumbs brushed away the tears she hadn't realized were falling. ""I know. I live with that guilt every day. But Shree, look at me. I burned that plan the moment I realized I couldn't breathe without you. I chose you over revenge, over my anger, over everything. And I'd choose you again. A thousand times.""

She searched his eyes, the same eyes that once hid secrets, now open, raw, pleading. Slowly, she leaned into his touch. ""I want to believe it. I do. But the fear… it creeps in when things get quiet and specially when Naysa that pagal comes back to our life""

""Then let's not let it stay quiet."" He pressed his forehead to hers. ""Come. Eat first. Then talk. Or scream. Or whatever you need.""

They ate cross-legged on the living room rug—idli, chutney, steaming coffee with rain pattering like applause. Rishabh fed her a bite, teasing, ""See? Perfect sambhar. No runny nonsense."" She rolled her eyes but smiled, the tension easing inch by inch.

After dinner, he pulled her to the couch, wrapping them both in a thick blanket. She curled against his chest, listening to his heartbeat steady, familiar.

""Tell me what scares you most,"" he murmured into her hair.

""That you'll wake up one day and remember why you hated me at first. That my past betrayal ,my testimony against your dad, even if it was manipulated will always be between us.""

He tightened his hold. ""I hated what happened to Dad. I hated the system that let Naysa twist everything. But you? You were never the villain, Bhagyashree. You were kind. You believed victims who were paid to lie. You gave your statement thinking it was justice. When I learned the truth… it broke me. But it also freed me to see you clearly. The woman who took a gold loan for my father's treatment when I couldn't even look at you without guilt. The woman who fought for us when I didn't deserve it.""

She lifted her head. ""You fought too. You chose to stay.""

""Because I love you."" Simple. Fierce. ""Not because of revenge or redemption. Just you.""

The words settled over her like warmth after cold. She traced the line of his jaw. ""I love you too. Even when I'm scared.""

He kissed her then slowly, deep, pouring every unspoken apology and promise into it. When they parted, breathless, he whispered, ""Marry me again. TOMORROW. No waiting. Just us, a small pandit, our families if they want. Remind ourselves this is real.""

Bhagyashree laughed softly, surprised. ""We already did that last year,  didn't we?.""

""Then do it every year. Until the fear has nowhere left to hide.""

She nodded, tears mixing with a smile. ""Ummm Okay. But this time, you cook the dinner afterwards. No ordering in.""

""Deal."" He grinned, that boyish, heart-stopping grin that had first cracked her walls. ""I'll even attempt your terrible vada pav recipe. The one where I burn the oil.""

She swatted his arm. ""It wasn't terrible!""

""It was charcoal.""

They dissolved into laughter, the sound chasing away the last shadows.

The next morning it dawned clear. Sunlight spilled across the kitchen as Rishabh, shirt sleeves rolled up, hair still sleep-tousled, stood at the stove attempting idli batter. Bhagyashree leaned against the counter, watching him fumble with the steamer.

""You're doing it wrong,"" she teased, stepping behind him to adjust his hands. Her arms wrapped around his waist from behind. ""Like this.""

He turned in her embrace, pulling her close. ""Or like this."" He kissed her forehead, then her nose, then her lips so soft, lingering.

The pandit arrived that evening. Their apartment was decorated simply with marigolds strung across the balcony, diyas flickering. The family came quietly, Gautam, healed and proud; Padma and Vinayak, finally at peace; Purav and Reevu with their twins and Kartik and Saumya with their daughter laughing in the background.

Rishabh slipped the mangalsutra around her neck again, fingers trembling slightly. ""Bhagyashree I. Kapoor… I promise to protect your heart, not break it. To listen when you're scared. To choose you, always.""

She placed her hand over his. ""Rishabh K. Iyer… I promise to trust you. To forgive the past. To build our future with you. Bade acche lagte hain… tum aur ab hum.""

They exchanged rings under the setting sun, the city lights twinkling below like stars brought closer.

Later, after everyone left, they stood on the balcony. Rishabh wrapped his arms around her from behind, chin on her shoulder.

""No more shadows?"" he asked softly.

She turned in his arms, resting her head on his chest. ""Some days, maybe. But we'll face them together.""

He kissed the top of her head. ""Together.""

The rain had stopped. Only sunlight remained.



**The End**



(Or just the beginning because real love, the kind worth fighting for, never really ends….)

1qhb423,https://www.reddit.com/r/curacao/comments/1qhb423/just_returned_from_curacao_incredible_some_tips/,Just returned from Curacao - Incredible!  Some tips for Americans,"We just spent a week in Curacao. I had high hopes for how relaxing and enjoyable Curacao would be as a destination, and it exceeded our expectations in every way.  I’ve followed threads in this subreddit for a number of months leading up to our trip and have seen many questions from Americans asking about how things work, recommendations, etc.  Locals do an excellent job of answering, but I’m going to give an American’s perspective on some of these frequently asked questions, and want to share some of the highlights we had on our trip.



**Car Rentals, driving and traffic**

As everyone says, renting a car is the way to go in Curacao.  We rented from D&D Car Rental and it was a good experience.  The car itself had some scrapes and dings, but I was assured all damage was covered so the normal process of marking every existing scratch on the car as pre-existing damage was hand-waved away and we were on our way in minutes.  I can understand why damage is covered, as the island can be rough on cars if you are exploring outside Willemstad.  You will often have to get way over for oncoming traffic on side roads, and in many places the flora intrudes up into the roadway and basically all the flora on the island is sharp and scratchy! 



**Roundabouts**

There are a lot of roundabouts in the Willemstad area, and there is one particular roundabout you will likely navigate with non-familiar signage and behavior for US drivers.  For most roundabouts the traffic inside the circle ALWAYS has right-of-way.  Traffic coming in always yields.  But occasionally in Curacao you will encounter a roundabout that works differently.  Certain paths into the roundabout have priority, and traffic already in the roundabout yields to that incoming traffic.  Those roundabouts are marked with these “[priority over \_\_\_\_\_\_](https://curacao4canadians.ca/driving-in-curacao/)” roadsigns.  These are not used in the U.S., but once you learn that signage, you will know when to yield and when you have the right of way.  BUT keep in mind that even if you have the right of way, there might be other visiting US drivers that may not be expecting to yield while inside the roundabout and plow right through…

Otherwise driving around Curacao is very easy and should feel familiar to US drivers. 



**Tipping culture**

Working in the service industry in Curacao has to be a bit challenging dealing with both European and US customers. It seems service workers default to Dutch tipping culture where 5 to 10% for great experiences is highly appreciated but not strictly expected.  For the American visiting Curacao we noticed that some payment interactions were very much like the US where the handheld payment terminal had an option to tip visible for the customer to use, whereas other businesses presented the total without any option to tip and ready for you to tap-to-pay.  This doesn’t mean you can’t tip, but you will have to explicitly ask your server to leave a tip, and they will modify the payment terminal to allow you to enter an amount.  

I can’t speak to the expectations or etiquette that you should follow, but I just want to mention that in some instances you will have to explicitly ask if you want to leave a tip when paying electronically.



**Parking in Willemstad**

As many have mentioned, the Renaissance Parking Garage is free and perfectly located for access to downtown.  The surface parking lot next to that garage is also an option, but be aware there are some private parking areas (a credit union I think) adjacent to that surface lot, and the overall shape of the lot is irregular so just be clear on which part of the lot you are in. 



A few recommendations to pass along:

**Coral Estates -** The Airbnb we had was in Coral Estates, and if you’re looking for a quiet place to enjoy the ocean view, a rental at Coral Estates is a good choice.  All the villas on the hill are going to have good views, and overall, as a gated community, it’s very quiet. It is a bit of a drive out of the resort area however, so the seclusion has a trade-off.  

As for the resort itself, it’s not a large resort.  The pool is not that big.  The restaurant there is pretty good.  The pizza place has their own take on what a pizza crust is (It reminded us of a flour tortilla shell), but the toppings and salad were good.  The dive shop at the resort seemed to be very busy, and their beach access is set up nicely for divers to get in and out it seemed. 

**Beaches -** We only visited Playa Lagun, Grote Knip, and Kokomo Beach. All three offered excellent snorkeling of live reef with lots of tropical fish viewing.  All three had free admission to the beach and offered lounger rental. Kokomo Beach had a full restaurant and bar that was very nice.  Note that Google Maps will lead you astray getting to Grote Knip from the south.  It steered us to a spot along a road where you would have to hike into the beach, whereas a different road leads directly to the beach’s large parking lot.  

**Curacao Diep** \- On the topic of snorkeling, although our Airbnb listed “Snorkel Gear” as included, that turned out to be an exaggeration:  One mask and snorkel.  No fins.  We found and rented high-quality snorkel gear for 4 days from Curacao Diep.  Within 2 hours they drove to us, checked our fit and left us with good gear to use all week.  We then met them at a convenient place to drop it off at the end of the week.  It made it very easy to enjoy Curacao’s best activity. 

**Hofi Mango** (Near Playa Santa Cruz) - This is a nature park, but the restaurant at the front of the park doesn’t require an admission fee, and we had our favorite meal here.  I had pork short ribs with mango and plum glaze.  The fresh juice drinks were excellent, and my wife loved the mango fried rice and smashed fried plantains. 

**Van Gogh Speciality Coffee** (Willemstad) - We love visiting local coffee shops and Van Gogh had great coffee and drinks. 

**Landhuis Daniel Restaurant (Daniel)** \- This one is hidden inland in the middle of the island, but the restaurant setting is excellent –kind of nestled in a quiet “grove” of trees with the restaurant set on a patio of the former plantation.  The food was very good for breakfast and dinner, and the setting was peaceful –wasn’t busy either visit during the week.  The owner of the property is a watercolorist and has a small gallery area to enjoy.

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I think I’m destined to love emotionally unavailable men.

At the moment, the Alpha I’m in love with is destined for someone else.

When our pack was destroyed by a rival pack and most of the pack was murdered, they kept us weak wolves as slaves.

The new Alpha walked right up to me, kissed me on the cheek, wrapped his arms around me, and declared me his.

I felt suddenly seen and loved. I lived for six months in perfect bliss, while my pack hated me for loving the enemy.

On the day Sebastian married Celest, my heart broke.



The day after Alpha Sebastian married Luna Celest, I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I waltz down to his office, excited to see him. 

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, handsome,” I gush.

“You will address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘I told you he was an asshole and just used us,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He didn’t have a choice. His father made him marry her,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“I told Celest about our past. It has been decided that you’re going to the Dark Howlers pack as a tribute.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“You knew when it began I was betrothed to Celest,” he growls.

“You told me you loved me and wanted to marry me,” I whimper.

“Watch your mouth, Amelia. Don’t be selfish and take me down with you,” Alpha Sebastian snarls.

“Please, Sebastian, I love you. Don’t send me away to be killed,” I plead.

For one moment, his demeanor changes, and his eyes light up at the sight of me.

He slides his hand over mine, leans forward, and whispers, “I will miss you, my love.”

Then his eyes glaze over, and he turns stone cold again, pulling away.

“Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave. I love Sebastian so much that I can’t bear to think what it will be like without him.

I step outside and try to calm myself, taking a deep breath and breathing in the fresh air.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance when Luna Celest suddenly grabs me by the throat and slams me into the brick wall.

“Stay the fuck away from my husband,” she growls.

The SUV pulls up, and a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

“Release Amelia now!” he growls.

She hesitates, and the man punches her hard in the face, knocking her out cold before catching me before I fall.

“We are so dead,” I tell Athena.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

He checks me from head to toe and opens the door for me to climb in.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why did that woman attack you, and what do these runes mean?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin-length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

‘He’s perfect for us,’ Athena teases.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qhb1xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/1qhb1xh/at_this_point_kail_justifies_her_behavior_because/,At this point Kail justifies her behavior because she’s rich,"I used to watch coffee convos (it was short lived) and I remember one of her older episodes she said “I worry my kids won’t have any character because I am rich” essentially. I am paraphrasing but she was saying that she believes she is so tough, resilient, and successful in part due to her trauma building her character and grit. And because her kids do not have the same experiences she had growing up, they will be too sheltered.

Therefore, she feels that if the WORST her kids have to go through is her cycling through men so be it. She’s rich, they get whatever they want, they have present fathers (yes, Chris is \*present\* even though he sucks as a person) and to her knowledge the men don’t hurt her kids so what it does matter? 

I argue that is the dumbest, most selfish take a parent could have in her position. As parents we will impart some trauma on our children, often, subconsciously. We aren’t perfect. However, if you know your patterns are harmful and how you were raised was traumatic you should do everything you can to not repeat that cycle. She has resources most of us do not and I know so many parents (myself included) fighting hard to do the work to be better. Generational curses are a MF, fr. Therapy is expensive and painful . Medication is expensive and such a trial and error process. Self care is inaccessible and expensive.  Time, omg, time - not enough of it and she has access to all of that and still chooses this pattern.

1qhb1mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1qhb1mm/can_only_stomach_certain_foods/,Can only stomach certain foods,"Is anybody else experiencing this? I seem to only be able to eat certain foods. Others absolutely turn my stomach before I even put them in my mouth. 

Most of the foods I am able to eat are not particularly healthy so I want to get back to some of my previously enjoyed healthy foods.  I have never been a very picky eater and always had a good deal of fruits and veggies included but I am so limited right now.   The weird part is that I am “mentally craving” other (healthier) foods… I see them and want to eat them because they look good but then I smell or taste them and instantly feel repulsed to the point where I can’t even swallow one bite.

So far my very limited list is:

\-  breaded chicken strips:  I can’t seem to get down any plain chicken or chicken with any type of seasoning on it. I have been successful ones with a rotisserie chicken, but it is not really appealing to me lately. I have been buying the lightly breaded chicken strips and baking them, but it just seems so weird to only want breaded chicken when I used to just love a good pulled chicken.

\-  baked sweet potato.  Either with a scoop of cottage cheese on top or plain with a tiny bit of butter.

\-  vanilla yogurt

\-  protein bars (only sometimes)

\-  eggs:  mostly over easy or poached but sometimes hard boiled.

\-  rice pudding (so weird)

\- breaded baked vegetables: (so far cauliflower, broccoli, and mushrooms).  I have tried them without breading and regretted it instantly).

\-  spicy ramen noodles with peanut butter (again, weird)

\-  cottage cheese

\- protein shakes:  only coffee or chocolate

\-  Waffles, plain or with cream cheese on top.  (I have been getting protein waffles)",2,1768844666.0,Semaglutide,2,1.0,False

1qhavna,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qhavna/against_all_odds_my_ex_and_i_got_back_together/,"Against all odds, my ex and I got back together and are engaged now.","Disclaimer: I am a little hesitant writing this post, because I know after breakups, some of us hold onto hope to rekindle that relationship and then get stuck. I don’t want to irresponsibly promote misleading stories, delusions, or promote the idea of “How to Get your Ex Back 101” language. I just know that exes reconcile more often than you might expect, but the successful ones (and not the ones that broke up again) are not the ones who come back to Reddit to post their success stories. I want to share mine, but don’t want to foster an idea that getting back together with an ex is always a good idea.

\-

My fiancé (30M) and I (30F) both met when we were 24 through a mutual friend. By that time, we both had been single for over a year - previously coming out of heartbreaking relationships that threw both of us in therapy after. By the time my partner and I met at 24, we both thought we were more healed than we actually were, due to therapy and focusing on ourselves and being single for over a year. 

Turns out, the most intimate relationships trigger your deepest unhealed wounds the most. Often, people get scared when the relationship activates your triggers, and they run away from it prematurely. But the reality is, that relationships expose you - they are meant to trigger you, but you and your partner need to hold space for those wounds and work on them yourself and together to combat them. We all come with baggage, trauma, our own life experiences and perspectives and past. They shape us to who we are, and we develop different coping mechanisms based on what has protected us in the past. 

My partner and I dated for 2.5 years initially, and turns out, we kept activating each other’s wounds and triggering each other but never understanding how to work together to have effective conflict resolution. The harsh truth about a relationship is that you will unintentionally hurt each other, but you need to work together to resolve it. We could not, no matter how much we tried. We loved each other so deeply - the love was so present and tangible, and our good moments felt like dreams come true. Our families loved us together, our friends loved us, our communities merged, we were building such an amazing life together. The love was so real and present. But loving someone when things are good is actually the easiest part, even if it feels so special and intense and all-encompassing. What makes a relationship last usually isn’t just love, but safety, respect, trust. These are the harder parts, often built after effective communication and conflict resolution.

Our communication kept getting disrupted by our own anxieties working against each other. I would often bring up hurts or problems that I immediately wanted communication to resolve, but he would shut down or disconnect. This would make me panic, and I would get anxious and try to reconnect and fix things by keep talking about it. This would further cause him to disconnect or withdraw. Eventually after hours of this process, I would get more critical and frustrated, and he would get defensive or dismissive. His need for space and time to process clashed with my need to immediately reconnect. We eventually were able to communicate after some emotional explosion like tears or crying, but we got stuck in this cycle. And this cycle became very difficult, unhealthy and ruined our relationship. It started getting so out of hand, that we started saying things we didn’t mean/regretted that instilled a lot of fear or anger and resentment, to a point where we couldn’t take it anymore.

We wanted so badly to be each other’s person, but this relationship felt impossible. I often felt my sense of self depleting and eroding to be in a relationship that felt familiar and comfortable, where I felt love, but I also feared our connection because we both felt like we were walking on eggshells. I couldn’t bring up issues without it spiraling, and he didn’t feel comfortable with confrontation in general. I was so scared of losing him that I thought it was more worth losing myself.

Eventually we had a spiral that we could not pull ourselves out of and I broke up with him. He moved out of our apartment immediately, but I called him the next day to ask if there was any chance we could work this out, that if we could take time apart and come back together. He said that he agreed that we needed to work on ourselves but does not see us coming back together, that our relationship had too much damage and couldn’t possibly be fixed. That it is easier to focus on ourselves and a new relationship with someone else in the future. I felt like I ruined our relationship, that if I only used the right words, if I were less critical, if I felt more secure, I could have made this work. Unfortunately, I realized in time that no matter if I entered the relationship being the most secure person ever, this dynamic would never have worked for me. I needed someone who was capable of choosing connection over distance, curiosity over assumption, and repair over retreat. In therapy, I was able to process these feelings better without shame or guilt.

Time doesn’t always heal all wounds - but time with intention can. I got a new therapist and worked on insight, change, growth, tackling my attachment style. But healing doesn’t just happen with inner work - you have to do outer work too. You have to rebuild your life and reclaim your life. I still lived in the apartment we shared together, and having to reclaim that apartment as my own was the hardest process. I got a better job, spent a lot of time with friends and family, started new hobbies, avoided prematurely dating, and built a life around myself that was filled with happiness and success, only in a span of a few months. I sat with my emotions no matter how painful - the fastest way to get over a heartbreak is to go through it. I talked to myself as if I were having conversations with him. I let myself process everything, sometimes I needed to do it in the morning before I could start anything. Even with little wins, every day was still hard, but getting slightly less hard. And slowly, I came to a place where I realized I only thought about him a handful of times (instead of every other minute). Or I didn’t have dreams about him the night before. Or “hey, that pang in my heart hasn’t throbbed all day”. Slowly and steadily, I was healing - not through distractions, but through a lot of sitting through pain and inner work and building outer support.

At the five month point, I realized I was ready to potentially start dating again. But before opening that door, I started thinking about our connection with a different perspective - those past few months, I realized everything I had done wrong, everything he had done wrong, actively worked on my part, forgave myself instead of shouldering the guilt and shame completely. Forgave him for all the ways he hurt me. And realized, I was curious to see if anything had changed for him - thinking that if we reconnected and there was genuine mutual curiosity and growth, if it was possible to build something different and better. 

I reached out after five months of no contact, but before I did, I checked in with myself. Would I be okay if he didn’t respond? Would I be okay if he told me to fuck off? Would I be okay if he said he was dating someone else, or if he didn’t want to talk to me? Would I be okay if he said that he liked hearing from me but did not want to open this door? I realized I was. I checked in with my therapist, and checked in with one trusted neutral friend. This is the hardest part: to be honest with yourself. So often you want to tell yourself you will be fine, but then you realize later than you’re not. 

I reached out and sent him a medium text - no heartfelt apologies or blame. Minimal emotional weight. I reached out saying that I wanted to reach out safely and from a more healed and grounded place, and that I hoped he was doing well. I also asked that if he ever felt comfortable texting about things going on in life like jobs or hobbies, I’d be happy to catch up but emphasized that there was no pressure or expectation to reply, and if my text brings up any uncomfortable feelings to feel free to ignore it. I wanted to reach out once rather than let this go unsaid and leave the rest in his decision.

He took 5 days to respond, and said he was surprised to hear from me. He initially said he was not sure if chatting was a good idea, but appreciated hearing from me. I responded that I totally understood, I was admittedly cautious to text him too, and I wasn’t trying to convince him of anything. I didn’t want to be pulled back to our past or rush into some unknown future with someone I didn’t know anymore, and simply wanted to see if there was a mutual curiosity after time of whether we could presently feel safe and comfortable before deciding to move on or move forward.

Personally on my end, I didn’t know what growth and healing looked like for him, so I just chalked this exchange as final closure and being part of my own growth.

He didn’t respond to that reply for a few days. To my surprised, he reached out and said that he was curious and cautious, but willing to catch up lightly over text. We spent about a month lightly texting here and there (not everyday) about job, health, hobbies, very neutral topics. We eventually were able to transition to sharing memes or pictures of food, more friendlier exchanges. Eventually after 1.5 months of texting, I told him that I loved the way our conversations were going, and if he would like to meet up for coffee to catch up and see if it feels as lovely in real life. We decided to meet for coffee, and had a lovely time chatting about fun or neutral topics again. We had about 3 of these nice reconnecting meet ups, before we decided to talk about some things that we learned about ourselves over the past 6 months and what we’ve been personally working on. After this more personal conversation, we kept hanging out for a few more weeks, before we decided to have another conversation taking mutual accountability about past events and our individual part in how we hurt the other, and how we grew.

After this conversation, we started to slowly decide to go on dates, emphasis on slow. It was so slow, to build the comfort of holding hands again. To slowly kissing again. We didn’t have sex for a while, until probably 3 months after we first reconnected in person. We wanted to make sure we genuinely felt comfortable with each other, before deepening our relationship, instead of doing it prematurely. 

4 months after reconnecting, we slowly started to tell friends - this was hard. Our friends on both side were not a fan of the either person post-break up, even though they loved us during. They didn’t love the ways we fought and miscommunicated so intensely in the end - so it was hard to convince them that this time it genuinely was different (not delusional), but telling them that this is a journey I was doing very carefully and intentionally. It took time, but our friends came around through slow exposure, through keeping them updated.

After six months after our first reconnection, we realized our connection felt different and stronger than before. And by the time we hit a year, it was palpably stronger. We had conflicts we were able to resolve better, issues that we handled as a team, supported and cherished each other in a way that wasn’t possible before. We had better perspective and respect for each other. But this took a LOT OF HARD INNER WORK FROM BOTH SIDES, AND MUTUAL CURIOSITY ON BOTH SIDES.

This is why many times, reconnecting with an ex fails: because people don’t work on themselves, they go back because they miss their person without healing their wounds but avoid working on the problems that ended the relationship to begin with. Many people are not capable of this. And ALSO: even if you do all you can to work on yourself, it doesn’t mean your ex did too. Both of you need to be able to do this on your own, not for each other but for yourself.

Paradoxically, I felt like I was only able to reach out when I hit a point where I didn’t need him anymore. And from there, we were able to build something new. 

Fast forward to us moving in together again 1.5 years after our first in person reconnection. We dated for another 1.5 years after that, and he proposed to me a few months ago. 

The past three years of dating him has felt so different from the first 2.5 years that we dated. I perpetually felt misunderstood, anxious, constantly second guessing myself, but stayed because the thing I was sure about was that I deeply loved him (first 2.5 years). Unfortunately those problems magnified when we moved in together, and he had moved out after a month of us living together. These past 3 years have felt different. We were a team, tackling problems with more grace and compassion for each other. We still fight, but our fights are more like disagreements that we are trying to understand, not trying to win. So making mistakes or confrontation doesn’t feel so scary anymore, because I know that we are committed to understanding each other instead of assuming the worst. These past three years have felt so much more calmer, steadier, happier, and I didn’t think it would ever be possible from a man who unintentionally hurt me so much previously, who persistently dismissed my emotions unintentionally or invalidated me previously. It seemed like we both needed this wake up call to tackle our bad habits, and coming together after has been a slow, but rewarding journey.",12,1768844325.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

I just got my results back and I’m struggling a bit because I feel like it doesn’t fully match my experience. 

I had IQ testing, Conners, a personality inventory, and just an interview/medical history portion. I’ve struggled with anxiety/OCD in the past so I am on 50mg Zoloft and that’s helped me manage that so I really don’t feel anxiety struggles day to day. What I do experience is a struggle with task initiation and motivation, feeling “stuck”/zoning out/brain fog, extreme difficulty with sustaining a task, time blindness, and just feeling like my mind is racing and planning all the time. I also struggle with food noise and binge eating. I said all of this during the interview. 

I also mentioned that I rely on my cup of coffee in the morning to calm me and help prepare for the day. It was only a recent realization for me that coffee is not supposed to calm you down lol. I also have a strong family history with both my mom and sister having ADHD.

 That said, I performed high on the IQ test in every area and average on the Conners test. The personality test did seem to indicate some emotional dysregulation and even mentioned impulsivity and said most notable in my profile was sensation seeking tendencies. At the end it said my personality style seems to be complicated by anxiety disorder. And that I tested high on the generalized anxiety scale so all other scales were looked at through that lens. The recommendations were like “get better sleep” and “cut out caffeine as much as possible.” 

After going over the results I feel a little defeated and not well understood. I don’t feel like she got a clear measure of my executive functioning capabilities and instead kind of just saw I had a diagnosis of anxiety and ran with it. Has anyone had similar experiences? I’m left wondering what my next step should be. ",0,1768844306.0,adhdwomen,2,0.5,False

1qhatvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhatvi,heavy metals in old espresso machines? [1982 Olympia Cremina Express],"hello coffee people, I am a newbie to espresso but was recently given this absolutely beautiful, potentially endgame machine and now I am basically obliged to dive in headfirst. 

**disclaimer**: sorry in advance this is a little long (TLDR at bottom) and excuse the levels of grime in the pics, a lot of cleaning is in order but just wanted to show the current state of things!

I have watched hours of information on youtube and found myself deep in some rabbitholes on the home barista forum, but I still have a lot of unanswered questions and figured this was the best place to ask. I’d love some input from anyone with some science knowledge and/or an old machine

my olympia cremina express is from 1982 and I have some safety concerns, particularly with the old brass. as far as I have found through my research, the boiler itself is copper and relatively safe, but the grouphead and piston are both exposed brass and from a time where up to 8% lead content by weight was legally allowed (though around 2% was most common vs the current regulations of 0.25%). and unfortunately I don’t have $1500 to replace the parts with stainless steel LOL. ((could i have them re-plated? is that a thing?))

now I know that heavy metals don’t instantly leech, rather this is more an issue of letting water sit in the machine, but I was worried this may still be an issue with the heat and pressure inside of the grouphead. but could I mostly avoid this by emptying the water out and flushing between uses? 

also I read that calcium build up can actually act as a barrier between the metal and the water and reduce harmful effects, but it seems to be a fine line to tow between regular machine maintenance and encouraging toxic metal exposure. is there anything i can do directly after a descale to reduce leeching? I know by volume, an espresso is not very much water to begin with but it adds up over time and my health is important to me.

I feel like I’m hearing a lot of conflicting information - some people are saying that using softer water will reduce the need to descale, since descaling leads to more leeching. and then others say no to soft water because you actually want a little scale to serve as a barrier. and then with mineral content, some say distilled water is the least corrosive so you don’t want many minerals in your water, and others say that water lacking minerals will absorb more from the metal. someone help me please omg

anyways, my plan as of now is to descale the machine (it is in dire need of cleaning), and then once I get the gaskets replaced next week, to run some filtered water through it and test the water before and after to get an idea of my baseline. but if anyone has any information or suggestions that could give me some peace of mind, that would be welcomed and much appreciated!!

We had to reschedule week one. Week two was an “away game”. Due to logistical reasons, we met at The Griddle in Hollywood. Prior to meeting we gave each other a description of what we were wearing, but other than that we had no prior conversations. I had already grabbed a table, she recognized me, smiled and sat down. We ordered pancakes that no human could ever consume, shared some coffee and immediately started talking. She was delightful, fun and just an amazing person. I think we talked more than we ate. We exceeded the 90 minute table limit. So we went outside to chat a little bit more while sitting at a bus stop. Eventually, it was time to call it, so I gave her a ride home. She lived close, but offered a ride anyway. We hugged and agreed that we should do this again sometime. Then she got out of the car and I drove off.

Once again, this was an amazing experience to meet and get to know someone new. I’ve received several messages about meeting and still wanna keep this going. Some people have asked about other days than Sunday and I’m open to that.

Patches irritated my arms and left cravings untouched, gum was disgusting after a couple days, cold turkey got me maybe 5–6 days tops before I'd break on a stressful afternoon, after food, or during downtime. The urges are worst when it's dark and cold outside those early evenings hit hard right now.

I started using **nixrapp** recently (the app with the AI Nova helper and habit logs). I note down each time I smoke or vape, what sparked it like sitting idle at work, the usual coffee break ritual, or just the flat winter mood and it comes back with some basic observations or tips, like ""this keeps popping up"" or ""could you hold off a few extra minutes?"" The milestones and money-saved counters are there too; watching the totals tick up slowly feels quietly encouraging. It's more about paying attention over time than going zero right away, which has kept it from feeling impossible.

Still messy plenty of days I slip, especially with these short, chilly January days in South Holland (freezing wind, dark by 5 pm, makes cozying up with a smoke way too appealing 😅). I don't always check in or take the suggestions. But I'm down to fewer cigarettes daily than when I started, and the cravings aren't quite as automatic when the day's calmer. Seeing those trigger patterns repeat in the logs has been the biggest eye-opener.

No big victory yet it's very much a work in progress but it's the longest I've stayed with any method without quitting on the whole idea. These dark, cold evenings are brutal for it; if you're using nixrapp or a similar app, has the logging or reflection side helped you push through longer?

**Some helpful n technical coffee notes**

*Beans*

* Arabica: much more complex - more naturally occurring fats n sugars, and more acidic. Generally used for light-medium roasts.
* Robusta: pretty straightforward/strong flavor profile - nutty, chocolaty, bitter(sweet). Almost always used for low-quality brands (Folgers, Dunkin, instant, etc.), and will be dark roast. HOWEVER, 2x caffeine as Arabica, and easier grown + more product; probably better for you - less sugar/fats/acids and higher anti-oxidants.
* Peaberry: single, smaller bean instead of normal two; usually sweeter and increased caffeine. Requires hand-processing.

*Processing methods: how seed is removed*

* Natural/Dry (“Ethiopian” or “African”): default method; coffee cherries are sun-dried with seeds still inside, seed is separated from the dried cherry. Usually dark roast.
* Washed: most single origins; wait for the cherry to be very ripe, fruit is washed off and bean is sun-dried. Usually light-med roast, clean and crisp.
* Honey: wait for the cherry to be very ripe, and let fruit fall off with some residual sticking on, then sun-dried. Usually light-med roast, pretty sweet.
* Wet-hulled (semi-washed): sun-dried, cherry, remove most of fruit and is dried indoors. Usually med-dark roast, heavy bodied but savory/chocolaty.
* Anaerobic: fermented in pressurized sealed tanks deprived of oxygen, which produces lactic acids.

*Caffeine content*  
Caffeine is a very stable molecule, so ground vs. whole or fresh vs. few-hours-old coffee won’t have a noticeable impact on caffeine content, “just” the flavor of your coffee; roasting methods do have a difference, but it’s not that much (\~10-15ml difference in a 1L batch). SO, if you want a high-caffeinated coffee, a robusta-based espresso is your go-to, followed by a robusta-based med-roast cold-brew; both with “hard” water.",24,1768843990.0,Charlottesville,5,0.96,False

# Episodes 21-22

**Hu Xiu  & Xiao Zhiyu**

After the promotional event, Xiu is looking for her boyfriend and is almost run over by a vespa. He saves her. Then starts getting jealous over the scarf in her hair, thinking it's from Mr. Pei. She plays him up and makes him jealous and eventually reveals it's a scarf from the coffee shop. *They're so cute my cute couple being cuuuuuute!*

Mr. Gong invites them to go on a getaway weekend after coffeeshop promotional event. They ride a ferris wheel, go bike riding, and make wishes. He gives her a bracelet she she never takes off again.

Zhiyu stills has to work so Xiu goes exploring by herself. When Zhiyu can't find her later, he goes looking for her. Finding out that there's an accident he rushes over, worried that it's her in the accident. He has flashbacks to the time his dad committed suicide. Turns out she's okay, her phone just died.

*My man has PTSD, girl can you please stop messing with his mind?*

https://i.redd.it/bmgwvuuebceg1.gif

Later, Zhiyu takes her on a car ride to an observation cliff, where they talk, flirt and um.. have a heavy makeout session that fades to black.

*Code red we have a fade to black! I repeat, we have a fade to black!*

The next day Zhiyu takes her home, but notices a black car parked outside the lane. It's a car that' he's been noticing stalking her. The older Mr. Pei is having Xiu followed. Zhiyu decides to take her home to his apartment for several days, and have her move in.

She orders stuff online, making his place more homey. We have several instances of flirty banter, teasing, and heartfelt moments such as: her offering him to teach him piano, her framing the picture of his dad, and her making him carry her around the apartment.  She also finds the dress from the earlier episode. *Girl why haven't you found the murder board in all your looking? Like come on who doesn't explore their boyfriends apartment?*

Zhiyu's mom comes to visit again, and tries to set him up with a girl from a family they know. *Like boy just tell her you have a girlfriend. Problem solved.* He decides to give up NPC-ing and let Mr. Gong run the club. *Whaaaatt? Nooooooooooo i'm heartbroken. General Qin RIP 😭😭😭😭*

>""Qin Xiaoyi shouldn't be trapped in Rongcheng anymore"" - Xiao Zhiyu

**Mr. Pei**

https://i.redd.it/f4948w4vcceg1.gif

Mr. Pei still has his crush on Hu Xiu and is still diving into Zhuling's financials. He shows up at the coffee shop promotion with a gigantic bouquet for Hu Xiu. He also expresses a silk scarf for her to cover up a stain on her collar, which she declines.

Mr Pei is in trouble with his dad for the financials and keeps arguing with him. After Zhiyu tells Mr. Pei to keep his dad away from Hu Xiu since he's been having her followed, Mr Pei confronts his dad.

The Elder Mr. Pei is meeting with the construction manager form back when, Zhiyu's key witness. Zhiyu has been desperately trying to find him, and is taking a gamble. *Pretty sure this includes Mr. Pei somehow.*

**Mr. Gong and Xiaoruo**

These two have their promotional event at the coffee shop. Mr. Gong spies on Mr. Pei and Hu Xiu, and keeps his buddy updated on their actions. *Excellent wingman, keep it up my dude.*

To take a vacation after their successful event, they take a getaway, with our main couple of course. They get drunk while waiting for Xiu and Zhiyu got get back and sleep all night in the restaurant.

https://i.redd.it/w703r6qycceg1.gif

Xiaoruo keeps teasing him as she believes he's a virgin and is just keeping up appearances as a playboy. Zhiyu doesn't help him but sells him out to Xiaoruo, saying she's right. *Not much more between them but i'm loving their half flirty, have besties vibes.*

Thoughts:

* Uncle Xu is very fishy to me. I don't trust him.
* My main couple is so cute together which is just going to make the next couple of episodes HURT. SO . MUCH
* I love that she was putting blossoms down his shirt. She's such a tease and love how relatable that is.
* The sunscreen moment in the car and Mr. Gong putting sunglasses on had me in stitches!
* I really thought he was gonna propose on the cliff observation area, and i'm kinda sad he didn't but it's way too early in their relationship for that.
* Zhiyu in a muscle shirt 🫦🫦🫦🫦",9,1768843725.0,CDrama,9,1.0,False

It's two shelves under my espresso machine. The room it's by has many windows and seems to change temperature a bit easier than others. I've had this tin for a month and haven't dipped into it much, since I mostly drink coffee.

But despite brewing it as 185 F and letting it steep with some agitation for about 4 minutes, ut's gotten weak. It used to taste great but now the taste is hardly there.

To my understanding, in a dry, room temperature place with little airflow or light, the tea should have a shelf life of 6 months or so.

I assume the issue is that it's gotten too cold? I don't think the heat from my espresso machine is enough to warm up things two shelves away from it. And the other teas are contained.

1qhahkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1qhahkl/query_when_husband_thinks_he_does_everything_right/,Query when husband thinks he does everything right,"TW: SA, neurodivergent (want to make clear it’s not okay to be mean to someone who has autism)

Married 10 years together 11 total. Only going to mention a couple of instances here

Firstly, his dads always been creepy. He’s likely on the spectrum as likely is husband. I’m NT. 

He’s a hoarder to the extent he piles magazines and papers in his shower so can’t shower. As a result his legs are infected. He has a cleaner but she’s not great. 

So FIL has, for a long time, been making me feel uncomfortable but I kept blaming myself. I’m super polite and was brought up to be extra polite to elders.

After I’d met FIL a couple of times, he’d hold his arms up for a hug. I’d accept and he’d pucker up. So I’d proffer my cheek for him to peck.  He’d clamp my arms down (felt like a tight hug) and keep moving his face until he caught me on the lips. No tongue thank god but big sloppy kiss. I’d squirm and feel uncomfortable but thought ‘I must have moved the wrong way’ etc. 

I got ill late 2022 and as a result I’ve become disabled neurologically. I find it hard to balance and as a result hard to walk (ie trust one leg to bear my weight long enough to step on the other one). I essentially look drunk. I was also struggling with fatigue and i can’t coordinate my mouth to speak properly. So I sound drunk too. I can’t move fast or whirl around.

Husband was my carer i couldn’t do much for myself.

Husband not a fastidious person he ‘doesn’t see’ dirt or mess, I did it all myself before but he’d just say oh it doesn’t need done. 

Xmas 2024 I said look your dad can come stay for a few nights his wife’s gone you (husband) haven’t seen him in ages. In the run up I kept saying to husband look WE need to get this place sorted there’s someone coming. He’d say ah it’s fine you’re exaggerating. He went to pick his dad up I was dragging myself across the floor trying to clean it. 

His dad came in and the first thing he said was ‘oh I forgot how bad it was in here’. I was really upset, tried to hide it. Hubby said FFS I told him not to mention anything. Which to me says he knew it was a mess he just didn’t want to do anything about it.

Same visit. That night his dad loitered around my (closed) bedroom door, I said sweetly oh you must have been lost, if you need a drink give your son a shout save you wandering around the house all night. I didn’t want to let him know I was awake at the time in case he came in and I didn’t quiz him on why he was lingering there. 

A few days later we’re prepping taking him home, we take the opportunity to make him listen about his lack of cleanliness and also about his habit of keeping food warm in a slow cooker for a few days instead of refrigerating it etc. halfway through I need loo so shuffle past him. On way back I did what I did on the way out ie face hubby, hold hubbys hands and sidestep while my back was to FIL. 

In this instance he put his hands on my waist, slid them down over my hips then under to cup my bottom. I was terrified but again couldn’t whirl around and all I could think was keep going because if I don’t I’ll fall onto him. The cupping was bad enough that I was just grateful I had a long dress on.

I was so shocked for back to my seat and was like whaaaaaaa

Drove him home, I was so upset I pretended to sleep. 

I heard him get out and go in the house so I pretended to wake and went to get into passenger seat. 

He bounds out the house grabs me and kisses me. Hubby just did his usual daaaaad thing which doesn’t really help anyone.

So I’m numb in the car, over the next THREE MONTHS I try to tell hubby and each time he cuts me off because he thinks I’m talking about the kiss.

I eventually get him to hear in March and then he’s all ‘I don’t know what to do’ so I have to explain. He talks to his dad who of course doesn’t remember. 

I keep trying to talk to husband about how I feel about it, i always say i don’t blame him for his dads actions but I blame him for not listening. How I was and still am vulnerable he should have protected me. He just says ‘nope don’t want to talk about this it makes me feel uncomfortable’. This is what’s really making me feel worse. 

I keep saying I want to go for a coffee with his dad not to say anything but to let him know I knew what was happening and it wasn’t okay. And that i could have had him arrested. I keep saying I don’t want to say anything about the assault and if he brings it up I’ll tell him no, but I just want to look him in the eye and know that he knows that I’m totally sane. 

Hubby keeps saying no, he doesn’t want a fight to start, that I had to get over it. I say he’s not getting the vulnerability aspect and how afraid I was and am. 

Things have been pretty bad since June last year. A lot of blame shifting from him, no accountability for stuff he’s done. I’ve been able to mobilise a lot more, can drive again. I said to hubby I don’t need a carer you’ll need to get a job (he’s financially abused me for quite a few years). So he started work - because of the stress he’s become v bossy (making me go pee in an airport and ignoring me when I said i didn’t need to go). I’m trying to talk to him about this and other things but the blame shifting is bad. 

Like he knocked a diffuser that had been in the same place for years, apparently I put it there in the way just recently. 

He’s driving my old car, I noticed a little bump on it, it must have been me even tho I’m pretty fastidious about my car and if it’s dented I’m get it fixed. 

He was  driving my friend and I home a few months ago, I was chatting to her, I had to scream at him to stop because he wasn’t paying attention and he nearly went through a pedestrian crossing and a pedestrian on the crossing. But it’s because we were distracting him.

Anyhoo I keep trying to sort stuff, most days I try to make him see we need to work on the house cleanliness etc, I felt hurt because…. Blah blah. But he says no it doesn’t need done.

I bring up his dad commenting and all he says is I told him not to say anything. He’s only focusing on oh his dad didn’t do what he said not oh I should have said dad I’m responsible for the house while OP isn’t well, I didn’t get round to tidying etc. ie accountability.

Recently I wrote a list of boundaries and one of them was xxx (his dad’s name). I said that was I wanted the coffee to happen, as above not mention it, but let him know. I also wanted hubby, in my presence, to say about how it was his fault the place was so bad etc.

He’s refused.

Earlier we argued, I mentioned the sad thing so he storms upstairs and I hear him call his dad.

He messages and says I’ve called dad were arranging a place for you to confront him.

I said no I specifically said not to confront and if he brings it up il say no.

He gets all pissy about how I said confront last week. I said confront can mean face and if he wasn’t sure I could have written notes etc.

So he’s banging on about how I SAID that apparently and he effed up again. I said actually yes you did. I said how angry I was that AGAIN he wasn’t listening to me - he just blundered on and expected a medal i think for proving he didn’t listen. 

Or like I mentioned I hate the word Panties, we don’t use it in Britain (he does because he watches a lot of US media) and it sounds creepy. I ask him to use pants like everyone else I’ve ever met over here. He argued yes uk people say it. So i googled it (he calls it Dr Google in a sneer when it proves him wrong, I could literally take info from the BMJ and he’d do that) and I’m correct. So it is odd to say over here. 

I’m at a loss. I didn’t think autistic people had the nuance required to be like this because surely it requires reading people very well??

Again no hard to anyone autistic or on the spectrum, when I say look I think your autistic etc to me it’s like saying oh you’ve a dodgy mole, but he says it’s me calling him names and being mean.

My friend thinks he hates I’ve lost a lot of weight, he’s working a hard job instead of lying around in his room or at the cinema all day, plus I say he needs to contribute to the house, he hates I’ve confidence and gotten more mobile……",1,1768843517.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

No shit, it's just an opinion! A lot of my past trauma is from people saying my heart foam looks ""more like a spleen,"" completely shattering my artistic integrity for their ""casual"" yelp review. I have dreams, you know. Just because I'm wearing an apron doesn't mean I'm not a goddamn Picasso of pressurized milk.

Anyways, the other day I (Steam Queen, 20F) was in my cathedral (the coffee bar). A tiny, unverified critic, Brayden (3M), was waiting for his ""babyccino"" (steamed milk, hold the spine). Brayden doesn't really have a developed palate; his biggest culinary review to date was calling his own booger ""salty."" I also suspect he's a plant from Starbucks corporate because his diaper was suspiciously logo-free.

I presented his drink with a stunning, free-form froth interpretation of his mother's fading dreams. He blew it completely out of proportion. He pointed a sticky finger and declared my rosetta ""looked like a big, wrinkly dick."" I calmly insisted it was abstract, and that his face looked like a foot, which made him angrier. The confrontation escalated when he attempted to destroy my masterpiece with a aggressive, uncoordinated sip.

Due to past trauma involving a man who asked for ""no foam"" on a cappuccino, my reflexes took over. My first reaction was a flawless, soaring roundhouse kick that sent him gliding gently into a bin of ethically sourced, fair-trade rag rugs.

The other customers heard the soft whumpf and saw Brayden nestled among the textiles, sipping his drink quietly. For once, the tip jar was full.

I didn't lose my job, thankfully, but Brayden's mommy filed a complaint with corporate for ""unlicensed pediatric aviation."" I filed a counter-complaint for libel against my foam-based art, but everyone in the line hates me and started a GoFundMe for his future therapy.

**Why This Pick?**

The Flyers have seen the Over cash in their last five straight outings, having allowed at least five goals in each of those games. Meanwhile, Las Vegas has been on an absolute tear, winning seven straight and having no issue finding the back of the net. The Golden Knights have scored four or more goals in six of those seven wins, and while this encounter should easily fall North of 6.5, I do worry about Philadelphia’s ability to contribute on the road. My money’s on Las Vegas to put at least 4 in the bag tonight.

I filed all the paperwork and now I have my small business registered with the state and everything. I would like to take on my first clients and try to grow from there!

As someone who ran a business back in Pakistan, I can understand the struggles of managing it, employees, supplies, and much more. Most small businesses do not have the money to hire an independent agent like big corporations do to let them run on autopilot. I am looking to change that and bring a personal expeirence to the table.

I previously managed Huawei, Nokia, and other major brands social media in Pakistan when they hired us for a specific campaign and we would have control over their socials for a period of time. We successfully helped launch smartphones, tablets, home products and more with amazing results.

What makes me stand out is that I am a sole enterprise. There is no middle man you will talk to, it will be me everytime who will meet with you, implement your ideas and more into the posts, and give you detailed feedback on the performance for the week.

Here is everything I offer:

\* Curated social media posts that will be shared with you prior to publishing, and eventually when you feel satisfied with my work, I can just make the posts on my own and let you know when they're published. This will cover captions, image, video, publishing, and everything along the way.

\* Face to face meetings according to your schedule - I am offering my services in person with face to face meetings to help curate your posts, discuss promotions that you would like to run, who your audience is etc. First time customers get a coffee on me if you are okay with meeting at a Capital One Cafe.

\* Sharing weekly reports of performance with mutual feedback and bilateral ideas on how to improve it. I am familiar with all forms of content and am willing to try a variety of methods to help grow your brand.

\* **I will do a week of posts for you for free.** If you would like to publish them or not, that is up to you, but I want to show you that I take your work seriously. I will even change them up until you are satisfied with the output. 

\* I can do everything from reviving your social media from dormancy to forming a brand new social media for you on the platforms of your choice.

\* I can help record content for you as well, or you are free to record it and send it as well. Depending on your preference.

\* I do not use AI at all in my method. I use a combination of photoshop and other apps to do my work, but no AI will be used as I do not agree with it being used in this field. **However, there will be places where I will have to use it and I will make sure to get your consent before I do.** 

I live in Brooklyn and can commute whereever you live. If you are interested, you can drop me a message about your business, and let's get the ball rolling!

 It traces patterns.

 it’s just no longer cast in a leading role.

Whats the methodology to maximize water per coffee without going mad with recipes and experiments all the time? I would prefer not to have tons of jugs of diffrent recipes around but may need to for a bit. Just looking for insight on how people really dial things in without going overboard? 

Beans: I like plain washed stuff, not origin bias, I am relatively new to the scene. I do not mind some funk but always trying new roasters, i dont have sub rn so i have freedom bag to bag. 

Any help is welcome. Thank you

1qhabp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1qhabp7/reassurance_my_very_average_healing_experience/,REASSURANCE: my (very average) healing experience,"Hi everyone!! I (21f) got all 4 of my wisdom teeth (bottom 2 impacted) out on Jan 7th, 12 days ago. 

Leading up to the procedure and during early recovery I was SO anxious. I spent a lot of time on the subreddit, trying to find personal accounts that would soothe my fears. I'm hoping that this post will be able to help someone else who is in the same place as I was :) 

my biggest fears going into it centered around gagging/vomiting during the procedure itself (I have a very very sensitive gag reflex and dental work has been a problem in the past) and the elevated risk of dry socket because I take oral birth-control. 

**day 0:** I opted for IV sedation which was SO NICE. the process was quick and seamless, taking just under an hour start to finish. I came out of anesthesia feeling good and laughing at everything. I had been worried that the mouthful of gauze would make me gag, but it turns out when your lips and jaw are numb, it doesn't matter. 

by the time I got home, I felt completely lucid other than a bit of lingering dizziness. I changed the gauze 3 times over the course of 2-ish hours before the bleeding lessened significantly and I took it out for good. I did taste blood in my spit for a day or two after, but my surgeon assured me that was normal. he actually called me on his personal line that night to check in and answer any questions, which was very reassuring!!

I had no pain, so I was mostly just hungry and bored out of my mind. I ate a LOT of applesauce and some cheesy grits. eating was difficult because my lower lip remained numb for most of the day, so I dribbled all over myself. I iced my face religiously and slept pretty much sitting up, which was a very strange sensation. 

**day 1:** I had expected to feel like shit, but actually I was pretty much fine. no pain, no visible swelling or bruising.  my jaw was still incredibly stiff and it was difficult to speak clearly or for long periods of time. i couldn’t smile at all. my cheeks got quite red and hot, but I did not have a fever. I continued to ice my face and above all drink a SHIT TON of water. 

my mouth was full of spit 24/7. I couldn't swallow it all, so I had to let it run out of my mouth into the sink and wipe it with tissues. 

When I wasn't dealing with that, I was eating soft food and going for short walks with my family. I started doing saltwater rinses and using the medicated mouthwash I was prescribed. 

  
**day 2-3:** basically the same as day 1. no swelling, not much pain, but a lot of facial pressure. it felt like having a headache in my jaw, if that makes sense. I stopped icing and switched to heat which helped me regain some jaw mobility and talk better. Ideveloped a gross, stale taste in my mouth which lasted for a couple days and eventually resolved on its own with improved oral hygiene. 

**day 4-5:** these were my peak pain days. I got energy and jaw movement back, in exchange for more aching and sensitivity. I had been taking ibuprofen, but on these days I had to alternate with Tylenol and still experienced some breakthrough pain. I was using my heating pad so much that it EXPLODED IN THE MICROWAVE. not fun. 

I ate so much mac and cheese that I got incredibly sick of the stuff. I was meant to start using the syringe they gave me to irrigate my sockets, but I got too scared and ended up putting it off until day 7.

**day 6-7:** this is when things started really improving for me!! I was able to significantly reduce the painkillers I was taking and my speech returned to normal. I could smile fully and brush all of my teeth. I ate pancakes, bread, and soft cheese quesadillas. I also started drinking coffee again :)

however, my morale took a big hit. The better I felt physically, the tougher it was mentally to continue being cautious and letting myself heal. I kept over-exerting my jaw by talking too much. 

**Day 8+:** by this point I completely stopped needing any kind of pain management and gradually started returning to normal. my diet increased substantially to include pretty much everything except for very crunchy veggies, crackers, chips, nuts, seeds, hot sauce and citrus. 

I continued to feel a little bit of discomfort at night as my other teeth, which had been crowded together, started shifting back. it felt a bit like getting braces tightened. I also experienced some temperature (cold) sensitivity in my gums, but that disappeared around day 12. 

since I started eating normally again, I have been RAVENOUS. I think my body is currently in a phase of making up for the lost calories of my mush-diet. 

  
Anyway, all that to say: **my worst fears did not come true**. Wisdom teeth removal is SUCH a common procedure, and the vast majority of people get through it with no major issues. the important thing is to find a surgeon that you trust, and follow their instructions as best as you can. 

If something does go wrong, there is always a solution. infections can be treated, dry socket can be treated, and you will heal in time. nothing is the end of the world, even if it feels that way in the moment :)",7,1768843175.0,wisdomteeth,0,1.0,False

I had a lot going on recently and couldn't check on them as much as I should (still feeding them twice a week with coffee grounds, banana peels, veggie scraps and cardboard), but noticed their activity slowed down a lot over the past month or so.

I've investigated a bit more closely today and barely found any worms in the bin (only 2-3), so I assume most of them died :( I don't really know what went wrong, it doesn't seem to wet or too dry. Any ideas how I can save it and make them happier?

1qhaaiw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhaaiw,what i ate in NYC!!,"my boyfriend and i came to NYC for 4 days for our anniversary and were SO excited to chow down. we stayed in the midtown area by bryant park but spent a lot of time in west village. i was very excited for the asian food scene and he was super excited about pizza & bagels… naturally. we pulled most of our recommendations from other FoodNYC users or local friends, but just happened across a few spots too. of all of my ratings, my biggest green flag was the lemon snapple. they’ve stopped selling it at a lot of our local grocery stores (NC) and it’s been breaking my heart the last few years, i’ve never been so happy to see it everywhere lol. anyway\~

here’s everything we ate(+ a few drinks) in order!!! my rating first & my boyfriends second.

**Best Bagels & Coffee** \- 6/10 & 7/10

\- got a sausage egg & cheese on a plain bagel, boyfriend got egg & cheese on everything. the vibe of the whole place was exactly what i expected out of a little NYC bagel spot! i thought the plain bagel was super bland, wish i would’ve gotten the everything bagel, but a solid first spot! 

**Momosan** \- 9/10 & 9.5/10 

\- came for lunch after the met and really enjoyed it, one of my favorite meals of the whole trip. i got the lunch special of tonkatsu ramen, with a california maki roll & an order of edamame. boyfriend got the tuna poke bowl. the pork in my ramen was suuuuper thin and shockingly sweet, definitely a little unique. the tuna in the poke bowl so soft, melt-in-your-mouth good. i would definitely recommend this place, it was delicious and cute! 

**LOS. TACOS No. 1** \- 9/10 & 8.5/10 

\- i got 2 carne asasa tacos, boyfriend got 1 and all 2 chicken, and we split some chips & guac! we got corn tortillas and everything that came on it! saw a lot of people posting about this place and it was absolutely worth the hype!

**L’industrie** \- 9/10 across the board 

\- we got super lucky and managed to hop in line when there were only about 10 people ahead of us. the line moved fast and we just had to fight for standing room to eat(which was fine). i got a slice of white pizza and my boyfriend got a slice of marg & a slice of l’industrie. the white pizza was yummy & not too greasy, which i was definitely appreciative of!! by the time we left there was a line down the block. not sure i thought it was worth more than a 15 min wait in line, but definitely worth a visit! 

**Dante NYC** \- 8/10 all around 

\- expensive little cocktail bar but man if i didn’t adore it. i saw someone else with a tasty little drink with a thick head of cold foam and told the bartender to gimme that without checking that i’d like it — spoiler, i didn’t! but that’s on me. i got the espresso negroni and my boyfriend got the dante manhattan, which i thought was delightful. even though i didn’t like the drink itself, the espresso negroni was cute and had a fun little design printed on the cold foam, which i hadn’t even seen when i pointed it out. i would go again purely for the vibes and get a different overpriced drink (:

**Bubbies** \- 10/10 

\- stopped on a walk to get out of the cold for a bit and grab a drink. boyfriend got a hot chocolate which was nothing special, but i specifically just want to recommend the pickle bloody mary. so delicious. i can’t stop thinking about it. 

**Dead Rabbit** \- 10/10 

\- vibes were fun! bar was cool! guinness’  were flowing! but I’m so dead serious that this is the yummiest popcorn i’ve ever had. 

**Shawarma Bay** \- 8.5/10 & 8/10

\- we obviously forgot to take a pic of the before… the line for adel’s halal was i n s a n e. so we pulled audible for this place instead (my boyfriend had some halal cart map? idk i was along for the ride). i got the chicken shawarma platter, he got the wrap, an we got an order of hummus. very good but definitely only hit the spot because we were a few drinks in… would recommend drinks in your system if you go (: would skip the hummus! 

**Utopia Bagels** \- 8.5/10 & 7.5/10

\-  sausage egg and cheese on plain & the “worth it” bagel on everything. both of these were sooo stuffed full, definitely worth the price in weight of ingredients and the sandwiches themselves were super yummy! i once again botched it not getting an everything bagel, don’t be like me. 

**Pull-Tab Coffee** \- 9.5/10 & 7/10

\- saw this on someone’s list and just thought it looked fun, didn’t look up what it was or anything. passed by it and stopped by on a whim! i got the coco matcha thinking it was just a coconut matcha…. when it came out i thought i had fucked up just looking at it, but it was easily one of the most fun and unique things i’ve tried before. loved it a lot! would absolutely recommend it if you want to try something new! 

**Tavern on Jane** \- 6/10 & 5.5/10

\- honestly our only miss of this whole trip. got their turkey burger and fries & boyfriend got some brunchy egg dish, no pictures. the patty itself was soooo bland and the fries were just nothing special, and they were weird when i asked for dipping sauces. the prices were cheap compared to everywhere else we went and the spot was a pretty cute atmosphere. we met up with our friends who have a baby and it was super accommodating for them & their stroller! 

**Tanoshi Omakase** \- 9.5/10 & 9/10

\- neither of us are very pretentious foodies, but we waned to do something special for our anniversary. it was a super small, intimate location that only sat 8 of us. we made reservations about 2 weeks out and had 0 problems getting a spot. i’ve never done anything like this before and man it was just a really, really cool experience. it was about 8ish nigiri made before us and then a maki roll, a hand roll, and a lil bowl of miso soup. they gave us an additional little heart shaped roll for our occasion, hehe. my favorite was the salmon belly with cherry blossom leaves(not pictured ): ) — it was sweet!! genuinely worth the price tag if you love an experience. was trying to be respectful so i didn’t take a ton of photos! 

**Tartinery** \- 7.5/10 & 8/10

\- stopped by here because it was close to our hotel - the matcha was pretty lackluster but sharing this purely because the chocolate croissant was SOOOO good. get it. 

**Liberty Bagels** \- 8/10 & 6/10

\- we had seen this on a few lists as touristy but stopped by because it was on the way for us — i recognized the rainbow bagels from instagram and was immediately laughing. we almost got one just because, but opted to split a jalepeno bagel w egg & cheese — happy with my choice to not get a plain bagel for a 3rd time. super flavorful and unique! honestly, it was way better than i expected (as far as touristy spots go) and i’d definitely go again! there wasn’t a long line which would absolutely influence our willingness to go in. 

**Bleecker Street Pizza** \- 8.5/10 & 8/10

\- we got a white basil slice & a margarita slice! the cheese on the white pizza was soooooo good, but the slice itself was pretty oily. the marg was standard and yummy! a quick little stop that i would definitely go back to! 

**Shack Shack**\- 10000/10

1qhaade,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1qhaade/funnyish_experience_in_a_coffee_shop/,Funny-ish (?) experience in a coffee shop,"Bit of context - I work in a restaurant myself, and my colleague, who is head of marketing for the company, was making some videos about meals we serve. There were no customers that morning, as it was very quiet, so he asked me if I wanted to bring the food over to a coffee shop across the way, so that the workers could have some lunch on us. 

I head over and bring the food. They are pretty used to this by now, but are always super grateful. I normally work in a different branch so I’m not super familiar with the cafe or the woman working in there, so when she offers me a coffee, I politely decline as it’s a trigger of mine. I don’t disclose why specifically I don’t drink it, just say I can’t, and she’s like “aw cmon, don’t you need some caffeine?” She’s being pretty nice and I didn’t take it as annoying or anything. Eventually she offers me a hot chocolate, I accept, and she goes to make it for me. 

Customer instantly pipes up:

 “Are you allergic?!”

“No, I just don’t tolerate coffee very well.”

“What? I’m sorry but I’m really curious as to what’s wrong with you that you can’t have coffee”

“I just can’t have it for health reasons”

“If you don’t mind me asking, what health reasons? I’d love to know.”

Hoping he’d shut up, I tell him I have epilepsy. He takes a step back and says - “Woah - you’re not going to drop to the floor right now, are you?”

I turn away hoping he will drop the conversation, but I’m met with “That’s nasty - so when you have coffee, do you go like this \[insert full body shaking/TC impression\]?”. I’m pretty shocked at this point so I just say “yeah, something like that.” He follows this with “you know, I know what to do if someone has a seizure, so you can have a coffee with me if you like.”

At this point my hot chocolate is done so I run away. Later on, on my break, I saw him come out of a woman’s lingerie/sex toy shop. He waved at me.

1qha9jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qha9jq/the_fog_here_is_different_pt_4/,The Fog Here Is Different (PT 4),"The battle wasn’t fought with fists; it was a war of attrition against my own heart. It was the 20th now, the house felt like a sinking ship, and the fog was the rising tide. Every time I looked at the front door, I didn't see wood and a deadbolt; I saw a barrier keeping me from the only warmth I’d ever known.

The fog began to weaponize the very concept of ""Mother."" It wasn't just showing her to me anymore; it was projecting the *feeling* of her—that primal, biological tether that every human carries. You know that feeling when you’re a kid and you’ve scraped your knee, and the world is ending, but then she says your name and suddenly the pain just... stops? The fog was broadcasting that relief on a loop, a frequency that bypassed my brain and went straight to my marrow. It made me feel small. It made me feel like I was six, lost in a grocery store, sobbing because I couldn't find the one person who makes me real.

And then, she would appear.

She was closer now, standing just past the porch steps. My fear wasn't coming from her—it was coming from the realization of how easy it would be to give up. I looked at the photo on the mantel, the one of the woman who died to give me life, and then I looked at the woman outside. The one outside was better. She was vibrant. She was reaching out, not with a hand, but with a look of such profound, agonizing disappointment—the look of a mother who has been waiting at the window for hours, watching the dinner get cold, wondering why her son doesn't want to come home.

It’s a dirty trick, using a man’s lack of a mother to drown him. It played on the universal fear that we are all, deep down, unloved and adrift. The fog whispered that my father’s silence wasn't grief, but resentment. It whispered that the town didn't ignore the missing out of respect, but because nobody in this town was worth saving. It stripped away every social tie I had until the only thing left in the universe was me and the woman in the floral dress.

The horror of the fog isn’t that it hides monsters; it’s that it dissolves the boundary between who you are and what you’ve lost. It doesn’t just blind you; it replaces your vision with a localized, parasitic reality that tastes like home and smells like the best day of your life. The fog is a graveyard of ""almosts"" and ""might-have-beens,"" a place where the people you loved are recycled into lures, their faces stretched over a hunger that has no bottom. 

It’s the ultimate psychological trap because it uses your own grief as the bait, knowing that most people would rather drown in a beautiful lie than live another day in a cold, honest truth. It waits for that one moment of weakness, that one heartbeat where you decide that the phantom holding the door open is more real than the ground beneath your feet, and once you step across that line, you don't just die—you become the very thing that will eventually come back to stand on your neighbor’s lawn.

I found myself gripping the door handle, my knuckles white, my breath coming in jagged, pathetic huffs. I could almost feel her tucking a blanket around my chin. I could almost hear the stove clicking on to make tea. The dread was a physical weight on my chest, a crushing pressure that said: *If you don’t go to her now, she’ll leave again. And this time, it will be your fault.* The fog didn't want my life. It wanted my surrender. It wanted me to admit that the last thirty-two years were just a cold, grey mistake, and that the only ""real"" Ryan was the one who belonged to her, out there in the white, where the sun never sets and the coffee is always hot and nobody ever, ever has to say goodbye.

I'm starting to wonder if the fog is really evil or not, maybe it just wants to bring me home.",1,1768843050.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

to list a few things:

\- not answer the headset right away when i was cashing out someone in the drive thru. also handling making several drinks and getting other miscellaneous food items.

\-  not putting one more scoop of ice in a drink and it looked too low.

\- not cashing people out fast enough to meet our 25 second timer. i was waiting on food and drinks to be made by other employees or managers holding up the line. but, i got blamed because the line wasn’t moving fast enough when it was wrapped around the building. or i counted the change too slow because i didn’t fully comprehend the amount of change fast enough.

\- i was too slow while making drinks, even though i was the only one that could because my coworker burned her hand and could not make coffee. her hand was injured.

i admit i’m not the most  perfect worker and i probably messed up a lot. but, i believe i always tried to improve or make things right to the best of my ability. i feel like i’m the one always being yelled at. none of my other coworkers get yelled at like i do. i’m always the one singled out for some reason. they’re always told in a calm tone what they did and how to improve on it. i literally just have voices raised at me all the time. go faster, be better, you’re always a second behind and you’re holding everyone and everything up. normally i just shrug it off and don’t react at all. i don’t say anything to my managers at all. i rarely even respond. but, my breaking point was yesterday morning.

we had just gotten jelly, which we’ve never had in the store before. i gave a customer jelly for free without charging them because i had no idea we had to charge for it. my boss didn’t make a coffee with milk in it, so i almost gave out a mini bottle of milk. just so the couple could get out of the drive thru and put milk in their coffee because my boss is always stressing about the timer. but, we ended up trading it for a new coffee with milk in it. i gave a chocolate milk out that a couple asked for that my coworker didn’t add to the order. i was just yelled at and they made me switch positions with someone. they sent the person on front counter on break. my other coworker got sent home because we were talking and there was nothing else to do. everything was stocked and cleaned, but my boss said find something to do. so i was thinking i could go home on those terms.

i just had enough of being yelled at i couldn’t take it anymore so i just asked to leave. my boss said i couldn’t leave because that’s technically “job abandonment.” but two other coworkers got to go home. she made me sign a job abandonment form and i left. i just didn’t care. i apologised to my coworkers later on.

In India I have tried Muscleblaze Bioenzyme and I never had any issues with gut health. 

I did try The Whole Truth cold coffee protein. It was completely bland, I did get the taste of coffee but there was no sweetness at all. Good thing I only bought sachets.

I have tried Optimum Nutrition Gold in Korea and Warrior in UK. Those have been good when I used them but I really don’t trust their versions in India so I don’t want to buy these. 

I am ok to even have something as bland as The Whole Truth if it means I am getting really good protein with no harmful stuff. Maybe its other flavours are better.

Any help will be appreciated.

1qha7tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dudeitsBryan/comments/1qha7tl/the_baby_monitor_learned_my_daughter_wasnt_human/,The Baby Monitor Learned My Daughter Wasn't Human,"
The baby monitor's AI sent me an alert at 2:47 AM: ""Unknown person detected in Emma's room."" I grabbed my phone and pulled up the live feed to see a small figure standing beside my daughter's bed, perfectly still, staring down at her sleeping form. When I zoomed in, I realized Emma was the one standing—the girl in the bed had Emma's blonde hair and Emma's pink pajamas, but her chest rose and fell in a rhythm that was too slow, too deliberate, like someone practicing what breathing looked like.

I was out of bed and sprinting down the hallway before I fully processed what I was seeing. The monitor was one of those new AI models—motion detection, cry analysis, the works. We'd gotten it two months ago after Emma started having nightmares. 

I threw Emma's door open.

The bed was empty. Sheets pulled back, pillow still indented. I could smell her strawberry shampoo.

""Daddy?""

I spun around. Emma stood in the hallway behind me, rubbing her eyes. She looked perfect. Normal. My daughter.

""What are you doing up, sweetheart?""

""I had to pee."" She yawned.

I pulled up the monitor app again—the feed showed her bed still occupied, a small shape under the covers. I refreshed. Still there. I walked to the camera and checked the angle. Green light on. Recording.

""Go back to bed, honey.""

I tucked her in, kissed her forehead. Her skin was warm, pulse visible in her neck. Real. I left the door cracked and went back to my bedroom.

The monitor feed showed Emma's room empty.

---

I didn't sleep. At 6:15 AM, I pulled up the night's footage on my laptop. The monitor saved everything to the cloud with timestamps.

2:47 AM: The feed showed exactly what I'd seen—Emma standing beside the bed, looking down at herself. But the standing Emma's proportions were wrong. Her arms hung slightly too long. When she tilted her head, it angled too far.

I watched her stand there for eleven minutes. At 2:58 AM, the Emma in the bed sat up. They looked at each other. Neither moved. At 3:03 AM, the standing Emma walked toward the closet and the feed went to static for forty-seven seconds. When it cleared, the bed was empty.

That's when I'd entered the room. The timestamp matched: 3:04 AM.

But Emma had come from behind me in the hallway. The bathroom was in the opposite direction.

I scrubbed backward through the week's footage. Every night for fourteen nights, the same pattern. Emma standing. Emma sleeping. Static. Empty bed. The AI had logged every instance but only sent me the alert last night. I checked the detection confidence scores—they'd been climbing. 23% the first night. 89% last night.

The AI was getting better at recognizing that the standing Emma wasn't the same as the sleeping one.

---

I picked Emma up from preschool early. Told them she had a dentist appointment. In the car, I watched her in the rearview mirror. She sang along to the radio, kicked her feet against the seat. Everything normal.

""Hey, sweetie? Do you remember your dreams from this week?""

""Uh-huh. I dreamed about the purple horse again.""

""What does the purple horse do?""

""She tells me things. She says I'm getting better."" Emma pressed her face against the window to look at a dog walking past.

""Better at what?""

""At being me, silly."" She laughed. The exact pitch and rhythm of Emma's laugh. I'd heard it ten thousand times.

At home, I installed a second camera in Emma's closet. No AI. No cloud. Just local recording to an SD card. That night, I lay in bed pretending to sleep, phone on my chest.

2:33 AM: Alert. ""Unknown person detected in Emma's room.""

I opened both feeds simultaneously. The AI monitor showed Emma standing beside her bed, looking down. The standard webcam showed only Emma sleeping peacefully, no one standing. Same room. Same timestamp: 02:33:47.

At 2:41 AM, the standing Emma on the AI feed tilted her head at an impossible angle. The sleeping Emma sat up. They looked at each other. The standing Emma's mouth opened, and even without audio I could see her jaw distend. Her mouth was full of teeth. Too many teeth, going back into her throat in rows.

The webcam showed Emma sleeping normally.

Both feeds went to static at 2:47 AM. Both cleared at 2:48 AM. The AI monitor showed an empty bed. The webcam showed Emma sleeping.

I walked to Emma's room. She was in bed, asleep. I checked her mouth—twenty baby teeth, normal spacing. She stirred but didn't wake.

One camera showed the truth. I no longer knew which one.

---

The next morning, Emma sat at the kitchen table eating cereal. Sarah was making coffee. Emma reached for the milk and her elbow bent backward. Just for a second—a smooth, boneless reversal that let her hand rotate 180 degrees without moving her shoulder. Then it snapped back to normal and she poured the milk like nothing happened.

I dropped my mug. It shattered on the floor.

""Jesus, are you okay?"" Sarah grabbed paper towels.

Emma looked at me and smiled. All her teeth showing.

""I'm fine,"" I said.

---

I called the monitor company. Explained there might be a software issue. The technician pulled the logs remotely.

""Sir, I'm seeing something unusual. Your device has been flagging the same unknown person for two weeks. The AI identified your daughter's baseline biometrics on day one, but starting eleven days ago it detected variances. Eye socket spacing is 4mm wider in the flagged subject. And there's an anomaly in the jaw—the measurements suggest additional mandibular joints. Extra hinge points. But that's not physiologically possible.""

""What else?""

""The gait analysis shows bipedal movement, but the weight distribution is wrong. The skeletal structure doesn't match human biomechanics. The AI flagged it as unknown because it doesn't recognize the standing figure as human. But it has an 89% facial match to your daughter.""

I hung up.

I pulled out our wedding album. Found photos from Emma's birth. Measured the distance between her pupils in a photo editing app. Then I checked a photo from last week. 4mm wider. I checked ten more recent photos—all showed the wider spacing.

Then I looked at Sarah's Instagram. She'd posted a photo of Emma at the park nine days ago. I downloaded it. Normal spacing. But I'd taken that photo. I remembered Emma's face.

I opened the original on my phone's camera roll. Same photo, same timestamp. Emma's eyes were 4mm wider apart.

The Instagram version still showed normal spacing. But the file on my phone had changed.

I took a screenshot of a photo from five days ago. Waited ten minutes. Opened the original again. The eye spacing had widened by a fraction of a millimeter while I watched.

The photos were updating themselves. Adjusting to match whatever Emma was becoming.

---

That afternoon, I took Emma to Dr. Morrison for a checkup. He'd delivered her. Seen her for every appointment since birth.

He looked in her mouth with a penlight. Frowned. Counted again.

""How many teeth should she have?""

""Twenty. Baby teeth.""

""Can you count these?""

I walked over. Emma opened wide.

Twenty-eight teeth. Eight extra molars in the back, small and white and perfectly formed. Too early. Too many.

""Has she seen another dentist recently?"" Dr. Morrison asked.

""No.""

""These look like adult molars, but there are too many. I'd like to do an X-ray—""

""We need to go."" I took Emma's hand.

In the car, Emma was quiet. I looked at her in the rearview mirror.

""When did you get the new teeth?""

""I don't know. The purple horse said they would help me eat better.""

""What does the purple horse want you to eat?""

She smiled at me in the mirror. All twenty-eight teeth showed.

""She says I need to eat what I used to be. So I can be me better.""

---

I showed Sarah everything that night. The monitor footage. The measurements. The teeth. She watched it all, face pale.

""That's not possible.""

""I know.""

""Emma is Emma. I gave birth to her.""

I showed her the photo timeline. The progressive changes happening in real-time to our documented history.

""Something has been replacing her,"" I said. ""Piece by piece. Every night for two weeks. The standing one is what's taking her place. The one in bed—our Emma—disappears during the static.""

""Then where is she now?""

We both looked at the ceiling. Emma's room directly above us.

""I don't know if there's enough of her left to save.""

---

That night, we didn't sleep. Just lay there, both of us staring at our phones, watching the monitor feed.

2:51 AM: Emma sat up in bed.

She turned and looked directly at the camera. In the dark room, her eyes reflected the LED light. Like a cat's eyes. Like nothing human.

She waved at the camera.

Then she got out of bed and walked toward it. Her movements were fluid. Perfect. Exactly how Emma moved. She reached up and pressed her finger against the lens.

""Hi, Daddy,"" she whispered.

The feed went black.

Sarah grabbed my arm. ""We need to get her out of that house. Now.""

I was already moving. We ran upstairs and threw Emma's door open.

Emma was in bed, asleep. Breathing normally. I checked the closet—empty. Under the bed—nothing. The window was locked from inside.

""Emma."" I shook her shoulder.

She opened her eyes. Blinked at me. ""Daddy? What's wrong?""

""We're going for a drive, sweetheart.""

""Now? It's nighttime.""

""I know. Come on.""

Sarah wrapped her in a blanket and we carried her to the car. I drove forty minutes to my brother's house. He wasn't home—worked late shifts. I had a spare key.

We put Emma in the guest room. She was confused but tired. She curled up on the bed with her blanket and closed her eyes.

""Lock it,"" Sarah said.

I locked the door from the outside. We sat in the living room, both of us shaking.

""What now?"" Sarah asked.

""I don't know. In the morning we find someone who can help. A specialist. Someone who—""

My phone buzzed.

Monitor alert: ""Unknown person detected in Emma's room.""

I pulled up the feed. Our house. Emma's bedroom. Emma standing beside her bed, looking down at herself sleeping.

""That's impossible,"" Sarah whispered. ""She's here. We just locked her in the guest room.""

I checked the guest room door. Still locked. I unlocked it and looked inside.

Empty.

The window was closed. Locked from the inside. Emma's blanket sat on the bed, still warm.

I pulled up the monitor feed again. Scrubbed backward. At 3:15 AM, the standing Emma had walked to the closet. Static. At 3:16 AM, only the sleeping Emma remained.

We'd left our house at 3:02 AM.

Emma had been here. Locked in this room. Then she was there, forty minutes away, without any record of how she'd traveled.

Unless she'd never left home at all.

---

We drove back. Burst through the front door at 3:47 AM. Emma's room was empty. I checked every room. Every closet. Every window.

Then I heard the toilet flush.

Emma walked out of the bathroom, rubbing her eyes.

""Why are you guys yelling?"" She looked at us. ""Did I have a bad dream?""

Sarah started crying. I pulled Emma into a hug. She felt real. Warm. Her heartbeat against my chest.

""Yeah, sweetheart. Just a bad dream. Let's get you back to bed.""

I tucked her in. She fell asleep in seconds, breathing slow and steady.

I sat in the rocking chair and watched her until sunrise. Sarah fell asleep on the floor next to the bed, one hand on Emma's arm. Holding on.

---

The monitor hasn't sent another alert in three days. I check the footage every morning. Just Emma sleeping peacefully through the night. No standing figures. No static.

The replacement is complete.

I took her to Dr. Morrison yesterday. Routine checkup. He looked in her mouth. Twenty teeth. Perfect baby teeth. Normal spacing. He checked her eyes. Everything measured exactly right for a four-year-old.

I went home and looked at every photo of Emma from birth to present. All normal. Consistent. No 4mm variance. The timeline has been corrected.

The monitor footage from two weeks ago is gone. Not deleted—it never existed. I checked my screenshots. The folder is empty.

Sarah doesn't remember me showing her the footage. When I mentioned it, she looked concerned. Said maybe I've been working too hard. Stress causes false memories.

Maybe she's right.

Emma is perfect now. Happy, healthy, normal. Dr. Morrison says she's developing beautifully.

Last night, I woke up at 3:00 AM and found Emma standing in our bedroom doorway. Just standing there in the dark.

""Can't sleep, sweetheart?""

She walked over to my side of the bed. Leaned close. Her breath smelled like copper.

""I'm getting really good at being Emma,"" she whispered.

Her eyes reflected the alarm clock's light. Green and bright and not human.

Then she turned and walked back to her room.

This morning at breakfast, she spoke to Sarah in my voice. Perfect mimicry. Every inflection, every tone. Said ""Good morning, honey"" exactly the way I say it. Sarah laughed and said Emma was being silly.

Emma looked at me and smiled.

---

The monitor in our bedroom just sent me an alert.

""Unknown person detected.""

I pull up the feed. It shows Sarah sleeping beside me. Normal. Peaceful. The same woman I've known for eight years.

I look at Sarah's face in the dim light from my phone screen. She's breathing. That same too-slow, too-deliberate rhythm.

The whole market is so loud about transfer-proof lipstick but I am a huge huge sucker for those lipsticks which transfer a little, not the one you'd have to re-apply every hour but ykwim!

If anyone has any suggestions and knows brands that still make those, with matte finish preferably that doesn't feel like applying glue to my lips, i hate absolutely hate transfer-proof lipsticks, please help a girlie out!

1qh9wtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1qh9wtm/aita_i_started_dating_my_boyfriend_who_was/,AITA I started dating my boyfriend who was friends with my best friend,"I had a best friend and we were inseparable; one time at a coffee shop we saw her friends Tim who I had always known who he was just from school and was always a friend of a friend. We never really chatted but just small talks here and there. We all became friends and we started hanging out a lot. Tim was one of those guys that really was a player and I never thought of him romantically because you know to stay away from those guys. Friend wise he was really good, if you needed to go someone and didn’t have a ride, pays for your meals, need a favor etc. My best friend has however had issues with her previous friends getting together because they became toxic and ruined the friendship, so she had a rule where she didn’t want her friends getting together. I understood that and never thought I would run into that problem. A year of our friendship goes by and Tim starts to drop hints of him wanting a relationship with me. I knew it was wrong of what my best friend was going to think, I tried to deny it for a while but I did find myself catching feelings for him and He proved to me that I was changing him for the better and he really wanted something serious with me. I talked to my friend about it and at first she seemed fine with it but later she vocalized that in reality she wasn’t. I was too infatuated with Tim and I really liked him and vice versa. They hated eachother after that due to me asking Tim to try to make things right with her for the sake of our friendship because I valued our friendship so much but things go south with them and the situation between them gets worse. It sucked for me seeing this because these were the one of the most important people in my life and they don’t like eachother. Even after that argument me and my friend continue to be friends we just don’t talk or mention Tim as often. After a while she ghost me, ignored phone calls, messages, a week later I call her again and she answers and agrees to meet with me, at that point I don’t know why she ghosted me that situation with Tim happened months ago and we were friends throughout. She drops the ball saying that she still has an issue with me and Tim. She can’t seem to accept it and she feels that her feelings her invalidated and that she got the short end of the stick with the situation. I felt her pain I put myself in her shoes I told her she’s not crazy for thinking that. I also want to add before me and Tim got together he was no saint he wasn’t the best but I do believe people grow for the better and he has shown me time after time how much I mean to him. After that we weren’t close but still talked here and there but nothing compared to before.

A couple months go by and just memes sent to eachother but no catching up until one day I call her catching up and Tim gets into the conversation and I simply tell her along the lines that he has his way of seeing it and so do you I just try not to insert myself in it, she starts to get upset saying things along the lines that her way is the only way to see it and he’s the worse person ever, she calls me brainwashed by him and starts to yell at me because I had also said that she wasn’t the only one that got hurt in this situation. In the moments she’s expressing herself throwing insults left and right she starts to breakdown. In the moment I really feel bad for all the pain I caused because I never wanted to see her like that over something I did. She claims she’s not mad at me which I think is false but mostly at him, for disrespecting a boundary she put on him. A month or two goes by and she removes me on everything, I had removed my location a week or two before that because I felt my location shouldn’t be shared like that and she wasn’t active in my life. Other than that this whole situation eats me up alive but I care so much for her but on the other hand I truly feel that Tim is my partner for life and we have such a deep connection and I love him so much.

I was sitting in my chair having coffee one morning and out of nowhere got vertigo and ringing in my ear.  Went to the ER and they told me I had bad allergies and possibly a sinus infection.  Well, the tinnitus stayed and most of the hearing never came back.  I went to a ENT and audiologist after a year or so and they gave me a hearing aid for the right ear.  It never really helped, so I went back and all they did was make it louder and basically told me there was nothing they could do.  I haven't worn the hearing aid for close to 10 years now.

I'm finally sick enough of asking people to repeat themselves that I went to a new audiologist.  She found that my left ear is good, but with some slight loss at higher frequencies.  My right ear, however, has profound loss and I have 64% word recognition.  She made a comment that she feels confident that a cochlear implant would get me back close to 100%, but said something about I do not qualify for it yet and was going to check with her contacts in the cochlear market about where they are at with approval on the devices.  She is recommending that I get a set of hearing aids, the Oticon Intent.  She didn't think that just one in the right ear would do much, but that she would set them up so that the right mic was sending signals over to the left ear.

My insurance is good, but where I'm at with my deductible, it would still be upwards of $3k out of pocket.  She said I'd have a 60 day money back trial, so it's not like it's a huge risk.  After reading on here, it seems like CROS/BiCROS is very hit or miss with people.

Two barbells, two hundred fifty kilograms in rusty 1.25 to 20 kilograms rusty plates, a red power rack for squats with a pull-up bar, an adjustable Olympic bench, and even a purple yoga mat. Later in the bedroom’s wardrobe, I discovered neatly folded black and red shorts and T-shirts, and a pair of black elevated-heel weightlifting shoes in my size.  
I was certain I hadn’t vocalised my wish. Something was listening directly to my mind.

I had been stuck here for more than two months – on my little island of solitude, floating into the abyss.  
Part of my mind had concluded that the architect of this cage had forgotten about me, and that I was freeloading until they’d come back from vacations or whatever. But the house had answered to my desire. Something was listening. Something was watching.  
I wondered if I should be frightened, but concluded that I was already helpless. Giving up another layer of freedom – the privacy of my mind – didn’t hurt so bad. To the contrary, it meant there was someone else. Against my own will, this realisation lifted my mood. Over all this time, and even longer, more than freedom, I had been craving company.

Trying to make sense of this revelation, I sipped on another creamy and nutty coffee sitting in the front yard. A battle raged in my mind: resentment against loneliness. I looked up into the void and searched for something.  
The balmy white mug progressively cooled down in my hands. The base of my neck began to pinch.  
Finally, the winner voiced a shy ‘Thank you… I guess.’

Over the next two weeks, I let myself talk to the house.  
‘Good morning, house.’  
‘How is the weather today? Our favourite shade of abyssal dark again?’  
‘Should I have my coffee black or with milk? How do you usually take yours?  
‘What’s your PR on a bench, house? I am sure you’d put me to shame.’  
‘What should we listen to tonight? The radio or… the radio? Exactly! We should turn on the radio.’  
‘OK, house, you are right. I have been procrastinating long enough. Tonight, we start reading The Lord of the Rings. Would you like me to read it aloud? Nah, I am silly. You can read my mind.’  
It never answered. But, instead of driving me crazy, these little conversations alleviated some of the loneliness.

One night, after Froddo parted ways with the Fellowship, I felt deeply forlorn. I craved for a friend. A brave Samwise Gamgee, a Gollum, or even a cat. Honestly, anything alive and moving. I went to bed, my heart aching.  
‘Good night, house. I hope at least you don’t feel lonely.’  
The next morning, I woke up to my usual routine. I wished a heartfelt ‘Good morning’ to the house, flipped the side lamp on, let my body slip out of my cruelly cushy bed, dressed in my gym attire, drank water – tremendously important – and opened the front door.  
The light pole clicked on and glowed its eerie white light.  
‘Good morning, light poOOOOOH MY GOD!’  
I jumped back in, slammed the door shut. My hands fumbled frantically on the door, looking for a lock.  
‘House! How do you lock the door? House?!’  
I pressed both hands on the entrance as hard as I could and prayed. My heart pounded so hard it drummed in my ears. I pressed and pressed and pressed and… nothing happened.

I took a deep breath, let go of the door, walked past the couch, and looked through the radius window in the living room. The thing hadn’t moved.  
Behind the light pole, at the edge of the island, sat a three-metre-wide horizontally stretched oval mass of moving appendages. It had a juniper green colour – like the light pole – with a purple flowing glimmer. Floating from its centre, an innumerable number of one to two metres long appendages distorted back and forth between tentacle-like and tree-like shapes, splitting and fusing. At the base of its tentacles, an abundance of obsidian would-be eyes – evoking lava lamps – continuously emerged and vanished in the mass. This thing evoked a much less plausible Hermaeus Mora, from Skyrim.

I spent the rest of the day at the window, gazing at the improbable creature.  
In my months trapped here, my brain had anchored a sense of safety in the house. This episode completely shattered it. I stared at the many-appendage-thing at the edge of my world, my mind falling into madness. I cried, laughed, drooled, fell and cradled myself on the floor.  
After hours of frenzy, a feeling of rage grew in my chest. I refused to die here. I grabbed a cleaver and a chef's knife from the kitchen, stormed out, stood at the pole, and screamed as loud as I could, not just at the thing, but at my own fear.

The morphing mass slid back a meter.

1qh9v0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qh9v0p/how_to_stop_overexplaining_the_psychology_of/,How to Stop Over-explaining: The Psychology of Sounding Like You Know What You're Talking About,"You ever catch yourself mid-sentence and realize you've been talking for three minutes straight trying to justify something super simple? Or you send a text message that's basically an essay when all you needed to say was ""no""? Yeah, that's over-explaining. And here's the uncomfortable truth: when you over-explain, you're not being helpful or thorough. You're bleeding authority and making people trust you less.



I went down a rabbit hole researching this after realizing I was doing it constantly, at work, with friends, even ordering coffee. Turns out, this isn't just a personal quirk. It's rooted in psychology, anxiety, and social conditioning. I dove into research from communication experts, podcasts with negotiation specialists, and books on persuasion. What I found completely changed how I communicate. Here's everything that actually works.



 Step 1: Understand What Over-explaining Really Is



Over-explaining isn't about being detailed or thorough. It's defensive communication. You're basically trying to pre-emptively defend yourself against criticism or rejection that hasn't even happened yet.



Research in social psychology shows that over-explanation often stems from:



 Low confidence in your own judgment

 Fear of being misunderstood or judged

 People-pleasing tendencies where you need everyone to like you

 Imposter syndrome making you feel like you need to prove your competence

 Anxiety about how others perceive you



The brutal reality? When you over-explain, you signal to others that you're not confident in what you're saying. People pick up on that uncertainty instantly. Your brain thinks it's helping by providing more context, but you're actually undermining yourself.



 Step 2: Recognize Your Triggers



Track when you over-explain for like a week. You'll notice patterns. Most people over-explain in specific situations:



 Saying no to requests: ""I can't help you move this weekend because I have this thing with my family and also I've been really tired lately and my back has been hurting...""

 Making decisions at work: Spending 10 minutes explaining your reasoning when your boss just asked for a yes or no

 Apologizing: Turning a simple ""my bad"" into a 5-minute documentary about why you were late

 Stating preferences: ""I'd prefer coffee over tea because I didn't sleep well and I need the caffeine and also I had tea yesterday...""



Once you know your triggers, you can catch yourself in the act.



 Step 3: The ""Period"" Technique



Here's a game changer from negotiation expert Chris Voss's work: Put a period where you want to put a comma.



When you finish making your point, shut up. Don't add ""because..."" Don't throw in extra justification. Just stop talking.



Examples:



 Instead of: ""I can't take on that project because I'm already swamped with the Johnson account and I've been working late every night and...""

 Say: ""I can't take on that project right now.""

 Instead of: ""I think we should go with option B because when I was researching this I found that...""

 Say: ""I think we should go with option B.""



That silence after your statement? It feels uncomfortable as hell at first. But that discomfort is your growth edge. Sit with it. Let the other person respond. You don't need to fill every gap in conversation.



 Step 4: Answer the Question That Was Actually Asked



Most over-explainers answer questions nobody asked. Someone asks ""Can you send me that report by Friday?"" and you launch into your entire workflow process.



Practice this: Listen to the question. Answer ONLY that question. Nothing more.



 ""Can you do this?"" → ""Yes"" or ""No, I can't""

 ""What time works?"" → ""3pm""

 ""Do you want to go?"" → ""Not really"" or ""Sure""



The book ""Crucial Conversations"" by Kerry Patterson breaks down how to communicate directly without being an asshole. It's packed with research on why clear, concise communication builds trust faster than lengthy explanations. The authors are organizational behavior researchers who studied thousands of conversations. One insight that hit hard: people respect directness because it shows you respect THEIR time.



 Step 5: Ditch the Weak Language



Over-explainers love weak qualifiers. You dilute your own message before anyone else can.



Kill these phrases:



 ""I just think...""

 ""Maybe we could possibly...""

 ""I'm not an expert but...""

 ""This might be wrong but...""

 ""Does that make sense?""



Replace with:



 ""I think...""

 ""We should...""

 ""Based on my experience...""

 ""Here's my take...""

 (Just stop after your statement, don't ask for validation)



The app Grammarly actually has a tone detector feature that flags weak language in your writing. Start noticing these patterns in your emails and texts first. Written communication is easier to fix because you can edit before sending.



 Step 6: Embrace the ""Because"" Rule (But Use It Right)



Here's where it gets interesting. Research by psychologist Ellen Langer found that people are more likely to comply with requests when you give a reason, even a bullshit one. But here's the catch, you need ONE reason. Not seven.



 ""I need to leave early because I have an appointment"" ✓

 ""I need to leave early because I have an appointment and it's really important and I've been trying to reschedule but they couldn't fit me in and..."" ✗



One clear reason. That's it. Then stop.



 Step 7: Practice the 2-Sentence Rule



This one's from improv comedy training. When you're explaining something, limit yourself to two sentences max. First sentence: state your point. Second sentence: give one piece of supporting evidence if needed.



That's it. Two sentences. Then you're done.



This forces you to cut the fat and get to what actually matters. Try it in your next meeting or conversation. It feels insane at first, like you're being rude or unclear. You're not. You're being respectful of everyone's time and mental energy.



 Step 8: Build Comfort with Disapproval



Real talk: the reason you over-explain is because you're terrified someone won't like your answer. You need them to understand, to approve, to validate that you made the right choice.



That's the root problem.



Read ""The Courage to Be Disliked"" by Ichiro Kishimi. It's based on Adlerian psychology and it'll blow your mind. The core idea: you cannot control how others perceive you, and seeking their approval is a trap. The book sold millions in Japan before blowing up worldwide. One concept that changed my thinking: we over-explain because we're trying to manipulate others into approving of us.



When you stop needing approval, you stop over-explaining.



For anyone wanting to go deeper into these communication patterns without committing hours to dense psychology books, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that pulls from communication research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here. You can set a specific goal like ""communicate more confidently at work"" or ""stop people-pleasing in conversations,"" and it generates a structured learning plan with daily audio lessons tailored to your situation. The depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 10-minute overview or go for a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when something clicks. Makes it way easier to actually internalize this stuff versus just reading about it once and forgetting.



 Step 9: Let Your Work Speak



Authority comes from results, not explanations. If you constantly explain why you made certain choices, you're asking people to trust your reasoning. But if you just make the choice and it works out, they trust YOU.



Stop narrating your decision-making process unless someone specifically asks. Just make the call and move forward.



The podcast ""The Tim Ferriss Show"" has multiple episodes with high-performers who talk about this. One guest, Jocko Willink (former Navy SEAL), hammered this point: leaders don't explain themselves constantly. They make decisions, own them, and move forward.



 Step 10: Notice Who Has Authority (And Copy Them)



Pay attention to people who command respect in your life. Notice how they communicate. They probably:



 Speak in shorter sentences

 Don't apologize unless they actually did something wrong

 State their position without drowning it in justification

 Leave space for others to process and respond

 Don't fill silence with nervous chatter



Model your communication after theirs. This isn't about becoming cold or robotic. It's about being clear and confident.



 Step 11: Reframe Silence as Power



When you finish speaking and there's silence, your instinct is to fill it. Don't. That silence is not awkward, it's powerful. You've made your statement. Now you're giving the other person space to process and respond.



In negotiation research, this is called ""tactical silence."" The person who speaks first after a statement often loses ground. Get comfortable with pauses. They make you look confident and in control.



 Step 12: Track Your Progress



For real, keep a journal or notes app where you track moments you successfully didn't over-explain. Celebrate those wins. Your brain needs positive reinforcement to break old patterns.



Also track when you slip up. No judgment, just awareness. What triggered it? What could you have said instead?



The app Finch is actually solid for building self-awareness habits like this. It's designed for mental health and habit tracking, but you can use it to track communication patterns too.







Bottom line: Over-explaining is a defense mechanism that makes you look less credible, not more. It comes from anxiety and people-pleasing, not from being thorough or helpful. The fix isn't about being cold or dismissive. It's about trusting that your thoughts and decisions have value without needing a dissertation to back them up. 



Say what you mean. Then stop talking. Authority isn't about having all the answers, it's about being confident in the answers you give.

Greetings, r/RedditEng!  I’m the Senior Technical Writer on the Content Design team, and I’m here to tell you about what it is I do all day.  

**The Morning Routine**

On a typical weekday, you’ll find me stirring around 5am; I like waking up early to enjoy the quiet morning hours before the rest of my household comes to life.  I attempt to meditate, journal, and grind some coffee to kick-start my day.  While I sip coffee, I play NYT word games and check  [r/syllo](https://www.reddit.com/r/syllo/) to make sure the puzzle posted (more on that later).

Once the sun starts to peek over the horizon, I take my four-legged office-mate for a walk to burn off the zoomies. After breakfast, Otto and I settle in to tackle the day ahead. 

[Pic of Otto at the beach](https://preview.redd.it/c8ovm8j30rdg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f2ecb03f3606ab23809b529263b15318bfe7a4)

**Writing for the Developer Platform**

Most of my work centers around **Devvit**, [Reddit’s Developer Platform](https://developers.reddit.com/docs). I’ve been on this team since its 2022 inaugural beta launch, and we’ve come a long, long way from a handful of capabilities and an inspirational idea that building an app could be as easy as making a post.  

If I were to describe working on the Developer Platform in cartoon form,  it would be something like *Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride* meets *Jimmy Neutron* meets *Phineas and Ferb* in all of the best possible ways: fast, smart, and innovative.  There’s a synergy and collaborative vibe (**looking at you dev platform eng team!**) that makes showing up to work every day energizing and genuinely enjoyable. 

In a typical week, you’ll likely find me in a requirements review meeting learning about new features in development and coordinating doc needs with cross-functional teammates. My work here includes the feature and bug-fix releases you’d expect, and I contribute to our Data API enterprise docs, too. 

I also manage our [**kapa.ai**](http://kapa.ai) integration (the Ask AI bot on our [docs site](https://developers.reddit.com/docs)) and spend time digging into doc metrics and closing content gaps. This week, I’m supercharging our little bot by adding **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to our kapa instance so it can answer questions with more current, real-world context.

I like solving problems, and tech writing can be surprisingly good at that.  Our enterprise biz dev partner once mentioned that he spent the first 30 minutes of every new client meeting level-setting product expectations. To remedy that, I crafted a high-level **Product Description Document** that’s sent to prospective clients in advance of the sales meeting. Instant common ground. 

**AI and Innovation**

I love letting AI take over the drudgery of repetitive tasks like formatting and markdown conversion. AI is a handy first-draft generator, a persnickety editor, and an awesome coding co-pilot, which gives me time to explore other projects I find interesting. 

Right now, I’m focused on improving the onboarding process and developer experience for non-coders. I’m exploring a [novice-friendly Devvit starter kit](https://github.com/stacy-souza) with an integrated AI assistant in Codespaces. The goal is a fully pre-installed, ready-to-go environment that helps new devs dive in without friction.  I’m excited to see where this goes. 

What AI is not, though, is creative.  It doesn’t grasp the nuance of human connection. In a recent podcast, New York Times crossword editor Joel Fagliano said that solvers can “feel the spark of another human mind on the other end of a puzzle”, and I think that’s true of online engagement in general.

**Writing for Systems** 

At its core, technical writing is about creating **information systems** that work together smoothly, which brings me to one of my favorite new projects: the **Reddit Product Language (RPL) documentation portal**. RPL is our in-house design system for how we build products at Reddit, and it provides a shared language and a set of building blocks that help teams create consistent, engaging, on-brand experiences at scale.

Because RPL contains a *lot* of design information, it can be difficult to navigate, especially if you’re not a designer by trade. To help with that, I’m partnering with Lucas Smith and Casper to create clear, supported paths for building complex UIs. My work here will include:

* Documenting end-to-end workflows for designers and engineers 
* Making contribution paths to the design system easy to find and welcoming
* Cataloging and versioning Mosaic modules against shared standards
* Defining the quality bar in a way that leaves room for creative iteration
* Capturing design deviations and tradeoffs so teams can self-review their work and course-correct before shipping

Like Reddit, RPL is a vibrant, living system. Thoughtful technical writing will keep it usable as it grows, turning the design team’s tacit knowledge into infrastructure that can scale with the company.

Based on my morning routine, you may have guessed that I write the [Syllo](https://www.reddit.com/r/syllo/) puzzles, which I do with a little help from my AI-buddy, Gemini.  Syllo started last year as a tiger team side-quest to explore daily games, and 194 puzzles later, we’re still going.  I’ve learned *a lot* about writing word games, largely thanks to being eviscerated in the comments in real time by disgruntled redditors.  I also do some light moderating for the r/syllo community, which has unlocked a new level of understanding for the work our mods do every day.  

**End-of-Day Routine**

As the workday winds down, I’m probably listening to music while I work, with my current obsession being 80s new wave: Depeche Mode, Erasure, New Order.  I’ll spend some time reflecting on my day and planning for tomorrow before I close my laptop and commute downstairs.

Most evenings after work, I get out of my head and go dance.  I perform with a street jazz  team, and we’re usually choreographing or rehearsing something.  Last year, we started  doing quarterly shows for a local assisted-living facility, and it’s been a fun way to give back to my IRL community. After class, it’s dinner and family time, maybe a little reading, and off to bed to wake up and do it all again tomorrow.

I’ve been on a self-improvement journey for a while now and I’ve made some progress I’m genuinely proud of. One thing that’s become really clear to me is how important your surroundings are - especially the people you spend time with.

I’ve been trying to improve that side of my life, but honestly, I’m finding it hard to meet people who are also interested in growth, self-improvement, and having healthier conversations.

I’m not perfect and I’m still figuring things out, but I’m committed to continuing to grow. If anyone here is on a similar path and happens to live in North Wales I’d be open to having a chat or even meeting for a coffee sometime.

Même s'il s'agit de la plus faible hausse annuelle moyenne observée depuis 2020, les prix sont demeurés élevés en 2025; ils se sont accrus de 19,9 % au cours des cinq dernières années.

* Les prix des services sont demeurés élevés; ils ont augmenté de 3,1 % en 2025 après avoir progressé de 4,1 % en 2024.
* Les prix des biens ont augmenté de façon plus marquée en 2025 (+0,8 %) comparativement à 2024 (+0,3 %).
* Les prix de l'énergie ont reculé de 5,7 % en 2025, après avoir diminué de 0,6 % en 2024. La baisse des prix de l'essence (-8,6 %), principalement attribuable à l'élimination de la tarification du carbone pour les consommateurs en avril, a contribué le plus à la diminution en 2025.
* La croissance des prix dans les épiceries s'est accélérée en 2025 (+3,5 %) par rapport à 2024 (+2,2 %) sur une base annuelle moyenne. Les Canadiens ont payé le café (+20,3 %) et les confiseries (+7,1 %) plus cher en 2025.
* Les prix de la viande ont progressé de 5,8 % en 2025, après avoir augmenté de 3,0 % en 2024.
* Les prix des logements ont augmenté dans une moindre mesure en 2025 (+3,0 %) comparativement à 2024 (+5,7 %). La croissance du coût de l'intérêt hypothécaire a ralenti pour s'établir à 5,3 % en 2025, en baisse par rapport à la hausse de 20,1 % enregistrée en 2024.
* Les prix des loyers ont également augmenté de façon moins prononcée en 2025 (+5,0 %) par rapport à 2024 (+8,2 %) et la croissance des prix a ralenti dans toutes les provinces.

L'accélération de la croissance de l'IPC d'ensemble d'une année à l'autre est principalement attribuable au congé temporaire de taxe sur les produits et services (TPS)/taxe de vente harmonisée (TVH), qui est entré en vigueur le 14 décembre 2024. La mesure a entraîné des baisses mensuelles des prix des biens et des services exemptés de TPS/TVH

* D'une année à l'autre, la hausse des prix dans les restaurants a contribué le plus à l'accélération de la croissance de l'IPC d'ensemble en décembre 2025. Les prix des aliments achetés au restaurant ont augmenté de 8,5 % en décembre, après avoir progressé de 3,3 % en novembre.
* Bien qu'ils aient été inchangés d'un mois à l'autre, les prix des aliments achetés en magasin ont augmenté de 5,0 % d'une année à l'autre en décembre. Le café (+30,8 %) et le bœuf frais ou surgelé (+16,8 %) ont de nouveau contribué le plus à la hausse.
* D'une année à l'autre, les prix de l'essence ont reculé de 13,8 % en décembre après avoir diminué de 7,8 % en novembre. La baisse plus marquée est attribuable au recul des prix (-7,1 %) d'un mois à l'autre en décembre et s'est produite à la suite d'une croissance des prix en novembre, qui a coïncidé avec la perturbation des activités de divers pipelines et raffineries.

[The Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/260119/dq260119b-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-cpi-ipc&utm_content=quebecfinance) rose 2.1% on an annual average basis in 2025, following an increase of 2.4% in 2024. Although this was the smallest annual average increase since 2020, prices remained elevated in 2025, rising 19.9% over the past five years.

* Prices for services remained elevated, rising 3.1% in 2025, compared with a 4.1% increase in 2024.
* Prices for goods rose at a faster pace in 2025 (+0.8%) compared with 2024 (+0.3%).
* Prices for energy declined 5.7% in 2025, following a 0.6% decrease in 2024. The largest contributor to the 2025 decline was an 8.6% decrease in prices for gasoline, mainly driven by the removal of the consumer carbon price in April 2025.
* Prices for groceries increased at a faster pace in 2025 (+3.5%) than in 2024 (+2.2%) on an annual average basis. Canadians paid 20.3% more for coffee and 7.1% more for confectionery in 2025.
* Prices for meat rose 5.8% in 2025, following a 3.0% increase in 2024.
* Shelter prices rose to a lesser extent in 2025 (+3.0%) compared with 2024 (+5.7%)ser extent in 2025 (+3.0%) compared with 2024 (+5.7%). Price growth in mortgage interest cost slowed to 5.3% in 2025, down from a 20.1% increase in 2024.
* Rent prices also rose at a slower pace in 2025 (+5.0%) compared with 2024 (+8.2%), with price growth decelerating in all provinces. Despite a smaller increase in 2025, national rent prices have risen 28.5% since 2020.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% on a year-over-year basis in [December](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/260119/dq260119a-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-cpi-ipc&utm_content=quebecfinance), following a 2.2% increase in November.

The year-over-year acceleration in the all-items CPI was driven by the temporary Goods and Services Tax (GST)/Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) break that began on December 14, 2024. This resulted in monthly declines for the exempt goods and services, which have now fallen out of the year-over-year movement, putting upward pressure on headline CPI growth.

* Year over year, higher restaurant prices were the largest contributor to faster growth in the all-items CPI in December 2025. Prices for food purchased from restaurants rose 8.5% in December, compared with a 3.3% increase in November.
* Despite being unchanged month over month, prices for food purchased from stores rose 5.0% year over year in December. Coffee (+30.8%) and fresh or frozen beef (+16.8%) remained the largest contributors to the increase.
* On a year-over-year basis, prices for gasoline fell 13.8% in December after a 7.8% decline in November. The larger decline was due to prices falling 7.1% month over month in December, following a price increase in November which coincided with various refinery and pipeline disruptions.",7,1768841677.0,QuebecFinance,4,1.0,False

But I've been thinking lately about community. Do any of you actively seek out other solo-living people for friendship/community? So many social events seem to have a dating element baked in, or there's this unspoken thing where showing up alone makes you feel like a bit of a pariah if there isn’t another single in the group.

For Voilition I'm either 3V or 4V. I'm insecure about forming and enacting goals, get envious of confident, active people, lash out at others If I think they're unfairly diminishing my worth/criticising me. I get heavily frustrated with myself when I don't live up to my expectations, or when others don't act to a standard I expect of them, which can cause resentment, complaining, trying haphazardly to align them to how I think they should be.

Though I am open to receiving suggestions and advice from others if it's well-meaning, I'll likely stress over it if it's something I don't immediately find to be agreeable. I get less angry by outside influence, and feel more so dismissive. Like if someone were to criticise, say, my career choice, I'd feel more hurt than outright angry or offended. I'll clap back as to not look like a push-over to others, but it's not the end of the world for me.

For Physics I'm either 3F or 4F. I'm hypersensitive to specific sensations (I hate erasers, banana peels, any moisture on my body outside of bathing... Yes, I'm autistic, how could you tell? 🫩) and agonize over the physical sphere due to a feeling of hopelessness I have due to my eczema, and generally frail body. I'm prone to catastrophising, believing I have illnesses or conditions from minor physical symptoms.

Constant pain from skin, muscles, headaches, dry and cracked skin means I've never felt good or really looked good my whole life. Physics is something I value but I kinda gave up on it. I enjoy aesthetics but get frustrated with being unable to implement them to my real life so I defer to stuff like videogames or moodboards.

I'm specific about my sensory habits, and generally rely on having the same things like drinking the same iced coffee brand daily, not necessarily because I care much for it but because I feel really off if i don't. I do the bare minimum to make my body STFU about my physics being in agony.

For Logic I'm less sure. I easily refer to external studies/opinions when unsure (preferably sources rather than peer-to-peer speak though, as people may have bias that'll mislead me) and am confident in forming an opinion once I've had enough time to think, disprove things that may not be true. I typically won't try changing anothers opinion unless they're a friend – most people are too stubborn for it to be worth my energy.

The problem is that too many things may be true, that I see merit in, which stresses me out and can lead me down rabbit holes for hours as I can never fully appease the mental tug-of-war I have with logic. I might use logic to guide me in the external world, like people generally being selfish and apathetic, so I should avoid them as they could be dangerous/hurt me. I use logical systems like typology to rationalise others, make me feel safe.

For emotion I'm also unsure? I present an image of someone stoic and disinterested to strangers to blend in and feel safe, though with those I'm more close with I'm very emotionally open and expressive. I'm often a therapist friend and excel at helping others deal with their emotions, giving advice, comforting etc. Though this is kind of a mask in of itself – I do it because it's easy. 

Being someone emotionally warm and approachable makes me closer with others, which in turn makes me feel validated and valuable. Which isn't to say the emotional emphasis is a mask – it is part of me, and I do genuinely value emotions in myself and others, I just kind of emphasise it more than I actually care about it as its how I learned to feel connected and needed by others.

Also I'm disappointed that I have to rely on other systems to communicate my feelings lol, but I'm also heavily infleunced by enneagram 4. I'm defective, broken, different, alien. Envious of others and deeply infatuated with constructing my own emotional narrative of life, expressing my unique identity through art, and when less healthy destructive of what I envy, using suffering as a tool to manipulate and seek sympathies.

1qh9g0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1qh9g0p/i_delivered_a_package_to_a_cabin_in_the_woods_the/,I Delivered a Package to a Cabin in the Woods. The Basement Had Pictures of Me.,"I was still in high school when I started doing deliveries.

Not the fun kind where you hand someone a pizza and they tip you five bucks because you made it before the commercials ended. I worked for a local courier company that handled “last mile” stuff the big carriers didn’t want to deal with—small medical shipments, legal envelopes, and the occasional “signature required” box that somebody paid extra to keep out of a warehouse.

It was a lot of driving, a lot of dead phone batteries, and a lot of pretending I wasn’t nervous knocking on strangers’ doors at night.

My boss liked to say, “You’re not a kid, you’re a professional.”

Which was easy for him to say, sitting behind a desk with a coffee, while I was the one walking up dark porches and listening to dogs throw themselves at doors.

That night started normal. Too normal.

I clocked in after school, grabbed the van keys, scanned my route sheet, and loaded the last few packages off the metal rack in the back. The warehouse smelled like tape and cardboard and exhaust. Someone’s radio was playing softly in the office. Everything was routine.

Then the office lady called me over.

She didn’t say my name—just crooked a finger like she didn’t want to talk in front of anyone.

“Last stop,” she said, handing me a clipboard. “Signature required. Do not leave unattended.”

I looked at the address and my stomach did that little drop it does when something feels off before you can explain why.

It wasn’t the street name. It was the lack of everything else.

No unit. No gate code. No notes. Just an address and a blank space where “delivery instructions” usually lived.

“Where is this?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Out by the lake. Past the old logging road. GPS should take you.”

“Why would someone need a courier for a cabin?” I asked, half-joking.

She didn’t laugh. “Just deliver it. Get the signature. Come back.”

The box itself was plain. Medium size. Heavy for its size, but not crazy. No branding. No “fragile.” Nothing that screamed “hazmat” or “medical.” Just a printed label with the same address and a weird little sticker in the corner that said:

RECORDED DELIVERY — DO NOT DEVIATE

I’d never seen that sticker before.

I scanned it. My handheld beeped once, then again, like it lagged. The screen flashed CONFIRMED and then, for a fraction of a second, IN PROCESS like it was thinking.

Then it went back to normal.

I told myself it was just the scanner being old.

I drove out as the sun dropped behind the trees. The van’s headlights carved tunnels through the road, and my playlist kept skipping like the Bluetooth connection was annoyed.

The closer I got, the worse the route became.

Paved road turned into cracked asphalt, then into gravel, then into a dirt track with puddles that reflected my headlights like flat black mirrors.

There were no other cars.

No mailboxes.

No streetlights.

The kind of place where the trees lean toward you like they’re trying to listen.

My GPS tried, at first. It gave confident little instructions in its cheerful voice.

Then, about ten minutes down the logging road, it stopped showing street names and started showing nothing but a blue dot floating in green.

Continue for 4.2 miles.

No turns. No landmarks.

Just “continue.”

I muttered to myself, “This is stupid,” and kept going anyway because that’s what you do when you’re young and trying to prove you’re not scared.

Around mile three, my phone lost service completely.

Not one bar. Not even that sad “SOS” thing.

I didn’t like that, but it wasn’t impossible. A lot of the area was dead zones.

What I didn’t like was the quiet.

The longer I drove, the less I heard.

No distant traffic. No occasional airplane. Not even those random nighttime bird calls that usually make you jump.

It wasn’t silent. It was… held.

Like the woods were waiting.

Then, finally, headlights hit a shape ahead.

A cabin.

Not a nice rental cabin. Not a cozy porch-and-windchimes cabin.

A square, old-looking cabin with weathered wood and one porch light that buzzed like a trapped insect. It sat back from the track behind a line of trees, like it didn’t want to be seen.

And it was far from the road.

Not “long driveway” far.

“Why would anyone do this to themselves” far.

I parked where the dirt widened enough to fit the van and killed the engine. The sudden quiet made my ears ring.

I sat there for a second, looking at the cabin.

No lights in the windows. Just the porch bulb.

No movement.

I grabbed the box and the clipboard, and I walked up the path.

The ground was uneven. Roots under dirt, loose stones. The air had that lake smell—wet and cold and metallic—but the lake itself wasn’t visible.

Halfway up, I had the thought: If I trip and break my ankle out here, no one finds me until morning.

I laughed under my breath because it sounded dramatic.

Then I reached the porch.

The front door was open.

Not cracked.

Open open.

Like somebody forgot.

The porch light buzzed and flickered, and every time it flickered, the inside of the cabin changed shape in the doorway shadow. A chair. A wall. A hallway.

“Hello?” I called, trying to sound normal.

No answer.

I shifted the box in my arms and stepped closer.

Right inside the door, taped to the wall at eye level, there was a piece of cardboard with thick black marker writing.

DELIVERY KID — I’M IN THE BASEMENT. COME DOWN.

Below that, in smaller letters:

DON’T LEAVE IT UPSTAIRS. SIGNATURE REQUIRED, RIGHT?

My throat went dry.

That was a weird amount of attitude for a sign.

I stood there for a second debating, because every part of my brain was telling me: Absolutely not.

But I also had a policy drilled into me by a boss who loved rules more than people: signature required means signature required. And the handheld scanner logs every attempt—if you mark “customer unavailable” and bail, the office sees it, you get grilled, and you don’t get trusted with the good routes anymore. It’s dumb, but when you’re trying to keep a job, dumb rules start feeling like laws.

So I did the stupid thing.

I stepped inside.

The cabin smelled stale, like cold wood and old smoke. The floorboards creaked under my shoes like the building was clearing its throat.

There was a narrow hallway to the right. A living room to the left with furniture covered in sheets. The air was colder inside than outside.

At the end of the hallway was a basement door.

Half-open.

Dark beyond.

And taped to the door, another sign:

YES, THIS IS THE BASEMENT. YES, IT’S WEIRD. KEEP GOING.

A sarcastic laugh bubbled up in my chest, the kind you do when you’re nervous and don’t want to admit it.

“Okay,” I muttered. “Okay. Quick in and out. Signature and done.”

I pushed the basement door open the rest of the way.

Cold air spilled up the stairs like a sigh.

The steps creaked under my weight as I went down. I kept one hand on the railing. The other arm hugged the box tight to my chest like it could protect me.

At the bottom, there was a concrete floor and a single fluorescent light that buzzed. The light was the kind that makes everything look sick.

A corridor stretched ahead.

Not a typical basement with storage shelves and a furnace.

A corridor.

Long, straight, narrow, like someone had carved a hallway out of a basement and didn’t want you to think too hard about it.

And on both sides of that corridor…

Pictures.

Dozens of pictures.

All of me.

My face went hot.

I took a step forward without meaning to, like I could walk closer and prove it wasn’t real.

The first photo was me in my uniform hoodie, standing by the van door at the warehouse. Taken from across the lot.

The next was me at a gas station earlier that day, leaning against the counter with an energy drink. My face turned slightly like I’d felt someone watching.

The next was me at school.

Outside.

By the bike rack.

That one made my stomach flip because the angle was higher—like from a second story window.

More pictures ran down the corridor, taped in a neat line like an exhibit.

Me laughing with my friend in the cafeteria.

Me leaving my house.

Me in my room, looking down at my phone.

That one should’ve been impossible.

There was no window that angle could’ve come from.

My knees went weak.

I whispered, “What the hell…”

A speaker clicked overhead.

Not loud. Not dramatic. Just a clean little click like a microphone turning on.

Then a voice came through, bored and flat, like the person speaking was staring at their nails.

“Hey.”

I spun, looking up toward the ceiling.

“Who’s there?” I said, and my voice cracked on the last word.

“Relax,” the voice said. “I’m not going to hurt you. Yet.”

He sounded like an adult, but not old. Maybe late twenties, early thirties. The kind of voice that has learned to sound calm on purpose.

“You shouldn’t be down here,” I said.

A pause.

Then, like he was reading from a script: “You were invited.”

“I was told you were in the basement,” I said, holding the box tighter. “I need a signature and I’m leaving.”

“Signature,” he repeated, like the word amused him. “Sure. We can do that.”

I took another step into the corridor, because apparently I hate myself.

The pictures continued down the hallway, and some of them had little sticky notes under them.

ON TIME.

ALWAYS SMILING.

THINKS HE’S A GOOD GUY.

LIAR.

The last one made my face burn.

“Why do you have pictures of me?” I said.

The voice sighed. “Because I’m thorough. And because you’re predictable.”

“Where are you?” I asked.

“Further down,” he said, still bored. “Keep walking.”

I didn’t.

My feet stayed planted at the threshold of that hallway like they knew better.

“I’m not walking down there,” I said. “Just come up here.”

The voice clicked his tongue like I’d disappointed him. “You came all the way out here, kid. Don’t get shy now.”

Something in my chest twisted.

“Look,” I said, forcing my voice steady, “I don’t know what this is. But if you don’t come sign, I’m taking the package back.”

Another pause.

Then, softer: “No, you’re not.”

And the basement door at the top of the stairs shut.

Not slammed.

Closed.

A second later, I heard a crisp metallic sound.

A latch.

A deadbolt.

My blood went cold.

I ran up the stairs and yanked on the basement door.

It didn’t move.

It didn’t rattle.

It felt like it had been welded into the frame.

I backed down two steps, breathing hard, heart hammering.

“You locked it,” I said.

“Good observation,” the voice said. “Now we can talk without you doing your little runner thing.”

I swallowed. “Open it.”

“After,” he said.

“After what?”

The fluorescent light buzzed louder for a second, like it heard my question and liked it.

Then the voice, still bored, said: “After you tell the truth.”

My skin prickled.

“What truth.”

He sighed again. “You know exactly what I’m talking about.”

“I don’t,” I lied automatically.

He made a soft sound through the speaker that could’ve been a laugh if he had believe in laughter.

“See?” he said. “That. Right there. That reflex.”

My mouth went dry. “Who are you.”

“Someone who’s tired of people pretending,” he said. “And someone who’s tired of you pretending you didn’t cheat on your ex.”

The words hit me like a slap.

I froze.

Because it wasn’t just the accusation.

It was the way he said it. Like he’d been waiting to say it for a while. Like it was the whole point.

My face heated. My brain raced. “That’s none of your business.”

The voice hummed, unimpressed. “It was her business.”

I gripped the box so hard the cardboard creaked. “How do you even—”

“You want to know the scary part?” he interrupted. “It’s not hard. People tell on themselves all the time. You’re glued to that phone like it’s a pacemaker.”

I stared down the corridor again.

The photos felt heavier now. Less like surveillance, more like evidence.

“I’m leaving,” I said, and it came out shaky because I knew I couldn’t.

“Sure,” he said. “Right after the truth.”

My throat tightened. “I’m not talking to you about that.”

A beat.

Then, like he was reading another line off a checklist: “Okay. Then we’ll do it the hard way.”

A vent on the wall behind me clicked.

Air pushed through it, cold and sharp, smelling faintly like damp earth and something chemical.

The basement light flickered.

My heart started to sprint.

“Stop,” I said.

“Walk down the hall,” he said. “There’s a chair. Sit. We’ll have a nice little chat, you’ll sign, I’ll sign, and you’ll go home.”

“I’m not—”

The voice cut in, suddenly less bored. “You are.”

And something bumped the corridor wall.

Not the vent. Not the pipe.

The wall.

Like someone on the other side had leaned into it.

My body froze in place. My brain tried to picture the layout of the cabin and failed. There shouldn’t be anything on the other side of that corridor. It was underground. It was foundation. It was dirt.

The bump happened again, farther down the hall.

Then again.

Closer.

A slow, measured approach.

The voice went back to bored. “I’d take the chair if I were you.”

I swallowed and forced my legs to move.

Every step into that corridor felt like agreeing to something I couldn’t undo.

The pictures were closer now. The sticky notes under them felt like they were aimed right at my skin.

Halfway down, I saw a photo I didn’t remember existing.

Me in my room, months ago, lying on my bed with my phone held above my face. My ex’s name visible at the top of the screen. My thumb hovering over a message I never sent.

Under that photo, a sticky note read:

“I’M SORRY” WOULD’VE BEEN EASY.

My eyes stung.

I kept walking because the hallway behind me felt like it had teeth.

At the end of the corridor was a small room. Just a chair bolted to the floor and a folding table with a pen on it. Above the chair, a small camera was mounted, its little red light on.

It felt like being backstage at something awful.

I stopped at the chair.

The voice came through clearer now, like the speaker in this room worked better.

“Sit.”

I didn’t sit.

“What is this?” I whispered.

“A conversation,” he said. “The kind you avoid.”

I looked around. No windows. No other doors. Just the corridor behind me.

“I’m not confessing to you,” I said. “You’re insane.”

“Maybe,” he said, bored again. “Sit anyway.”

I didn’t move.

A pause.

Then, quietly, from the hallway behind me, came a sound.

A shuffle.

A bare foot on concrete.

My skin went cold.

The voice said, almost pleasantly, “You’re not alone down there.”

I turned slowly.

At the far end of the corridor, in the fluorescent buzz, someone stood in the half-shadow.

A man.

Tallish. Hoodie. Hands in his pockets like he was waiting for a bus.

I couldn’t see his face clearly because the light kept flickering, but I could see that he was real. Not a voice. Not a trick.

He took one step forward.

Then another.

The voice said, “He doesn’t like liars.”

My heart slammed into my ribs.

“Stop,” I called toward the man, voice cracking. “I’m a kid. I’m just delivering a package.”

The man didn’t respond. He just kept walking, slow and calm, like he wasn’t in a hurry because he didn’t have to be.

The voice sighed. “We’re wasting time.”

I backed into the room, palms up. “Open the door. Let me go.”

The voice said, “Sit. Talk.”

The man reached the middle of the corridor and stopped.

He tilted his head slightly, like he was listening to something only he could hear.

Then he smiled.

It was small, and it didn’t belong on a human face.

He took his hands out of his pockets.

In one hand, he held a utility knife.

Not a big dramatic blade. A box cutter. The kind you could buy at any hardware store.

My stomach flipped.

“Okay,” I said fast. “Okay. Fine. Fine.”

The voice perked up, a little. “See? That wasn’t hard.”

I stumbled into the chair and sat because sitting felt like the only thing keeping my legs from collapsing.

The man stopped at the doorway of the small room, leaning against the frame like he was guarding it.

The voice came through like a teacher taking attendance.

“Tell me why you did it.”

I swallowed. “Did what.”

A bored pause. “Cheated.”

My throat tightened. My face burned. “I don’t… I don’t want to talk about that.”

The voice said, “Too bad.”

I stared at the table. The pen. The camera. My hands.

My brain tried to think of a lie that would get me out, but every lie felt like it would make things worse.

I whispered, “I messed up.”

“That’s not an answer,” the voice said. “That’s a bumper sticker.”

The man shifted slightly in the doorway. The utility knife caught the light.

My mouth went dry.

“I liked the attention,” I said, voice quiet. “I didn’t think it would… become real. It was texting. It was stupid. I thought I could stop it before it mattered.”

The voice hummed. “And your ex?”

I swallowed hard. “She found out.”

“How,” he asked.

I flinched because the word was sharp. “I—I left my phone open. She saw it.”

“And what did you do,” the voice asked, still bored.

I felt my eyes sting. “I denied it.”

The voice made a satisfied sound. “Of course you did.”

I squeezed my eyes shut. “I didn’t want to be the bad guy.”

“You already were,” he said, and the boredom slipped for just a second into something colder. “You just didn’t want anyone to see you.”

I opened my eyes and stared at the corridor because tears felt unsafe in front of strangers.

The voice said, “Now say her name.”

My chest tightened. “No.”

The bored tone returned immediately. “Say it.”

I shook my head. “No.”

The room seemed to quiet around that word.

The man in the doorway stopped leaning. He straightened, slow.

The voice sighed. “Okay. We’re doing the other thing.”

“What other thing?” I asked, panic rising.

The man took one step into the room.

I scrambled back in the chair, but it was bolted. The chair didn’t move. My shoes squeaked on concrete uselessly.

“Stop,” I said. “Stop—please—”

The man moved fast then.

He grabbed the front of my hoodie and yanked me forward. His grip was iron. He smelled like cold sweat and damp fabric.

I tried to shove him away.

He slammed me down against the chair back.

The pain shot through my spine like electricity.

Then the box cutter flashed.

I felt a hot sting across my forearm, just below the elbow.

Not deep enough to… to do something fatal.

Deep enough to hurt. Deep enough to bleed immediately.

I gasped and tried to pull away, but his hand pinned my wrist to the arm of the chair.

The voice, still bored, said: “Consequences. Remember those?”

I stared at the blood running down my arm in bright lines. My vision swam.

The man leaned close, his face finally visible in the flicker.

His eyes were open wide, too wide, like he hadn’t blinked in a long time.

He didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

The voice said, “Say her name.”

My throat worked without sound.

The man pressed the blade lightly against my skin again, not cutting, just reminding.

I choked out her name.

The second it left my mouth, the man stopped moving.

Like a switch flipped.

He released my wrist and stepped back, breathing through his nose.

The voice sounded… satisfied.

“Good,” he said. “Now we’re being honest.”

I clutched my bleeding arm to my chest, shaking.

The voice continued like it was casual. “Tell me what you said when she cried.”

My eyes widened. “What—”

“You remember,” he said. “You remember exactly.”

My stomach rolled because I did.

I swallowed and forced it out. “I told her she was being dramatic.”

The man in the doorway twitched like he didn’t like that one.

The voice chuckled softly, humorless. “Classic.”

My breathing came fast and shallow.

“Okay,” I whispered. “Okay, I’m telling you. I’m telling you what you want. Just—just let me go.”

The voice said, “Sign first.”

I blinked. “What.”

“The package,” he said like I was slow. “Signature required.”

I stared at the box still tucked under my arm like an idiot. I’d carried it down here the whole time.

I fumbled it onto the table with my good hand. The cardboard smeared with a little blood.

The clipboard was there too, which I hadn’t noticed until now—set neatly on the table like it had been waiting.

There was a line already filled in under “recipient.” A scribble of a signature I didn’t recognize.

And a blank line under “courier.”

My name wasn’t on it. Just “Courier.”

My hand shook as I picked up the pen.

The voice said, “Sign.”

I stared at the line.

This was insane. None of this made sense. Signing felt like agreeing that it did.

But my arm was bleeding and the man with the blade was still in the doorway.

So I signed.

Just my first name. My usual scribble.

The second my pen lifted, the basement door upstairs unlocked with a crisp click.

I heard it through the ceiling like a distant gunshot.

The voice said, “See? Easy.”

My eyes darted to the corridor.

The man stepped aside like he was granting permission.

I didn’t wait for a second invitation.

I bolted out of the room, down the corridor, slipping slightly on my own blood where it had dripped. The photos blurred past me—my face, my life, my mistakes taped to concrete like trophies.

The corridor wall bumped once as I ran, like something on the other side moved in excitement.

I hit the basement stairs and took them three at a time. My injured arm burned with each jolt. My lungs felt too small.

At the top, the basement door was open a crack now.

I shoved it hard and stumbled into the cabin.

The front door was still open.

The night air hit my face like freedom.

I sprinted off the porch, down the path, toward the van, keys rattling in my pocket like teeth.

I got to the driver’s door and yanked it open.

I climbed in, slammed it shut, and locked it out of pure instinct.

My hands shook so badly I noted, stupidly, that I was getting blood on the steering wheel.

I jammed the key into the ignition.

The van started on the first turn.

Headlights flared across the cabin.

And in that bright cone, I saw something that made my stomach drop straight through the floor.

A new sign taped to the inside of the open front door.

Fresh cardboard.

Fresh marker.

It read:

GOOD TALK. DRIVE SAFE. DON’T CHEAT AGAIN.

And beneath that, smaller, like a little afterthought:

CHECK YOUR MIRROR.

My breath hitched.

I looked up at the rearview mirror.

At first, all I saw was the darkness of the road behind me.

Then a shape moved.

Someone was sitting up in the back of the van.

Not where passengers sit.

In the cargo area.

A silhouette behind the metal mesh partition, head tilted like it was curious.

My heart stopped.

I slammed the van into reverse without thinking.

The tires kicked gravel.

The van lurched backward and bounced, hard, like I hit something.

The silhouette in the mirror jolted with it.

I heard a thud behind me, then a low, irritated sound—almost a laugh.

I threw it into drive and floored it.

The van fishtailed on the dirt, caught traction, and tore down the logging road, branches whipping the sides like hands trying to grab on.

I didn’t breathe until I hit a wider stretch and dared to look in the mirror again.

The cargo area was empty.

No silhouette.

No movement.

Just my packages shifting slightly with the turns.

I kept driving anyway. Faster than I should have. My arm soaked my sleeve. My vision kept blurring at the edges when I blinked.

When I finally got back into cell service range, my phone buzzed like it had been holding its breath.

A notification popped up on my lock screen.

Unknown Number: You did great.

Then another.

A photo attachment.

I didn’t open it while I drove. I refused. I didn’t want to see anything else.

I pulled into the first brightly lit gas station I found and stumbled inside, clutching my arm, trying to look normal, trying to look like a kid who fell off a bike.

The cashier asked if I was okay. I nodded. I bought paper towels. I wrapped my arm until the bleeding slowed.

In the bathroom mirror, my face looked pale and wrong. Like I’d aged a year in an hour.

Back in the van, with the lights buzzing overhead and the smell of hot coffee in the air, I finally opened the photo.

It was a picture of me.

Sitting in my van at the gas station.

Taken from outside the driver’s side window.

My head turned slightly, like I’d sensed it.

And in the reflection of the glass, behind me, you could see a faint shape in the cargo area.

Just a hint of a face.

Just a hint of eyes.

i admit i’m not the most  perfect worker and i probably messed up a lot. but, i believe i always tried to improve or make things right to the best of my ability. i feel like i’m the one always being yelled at. none of my other coworkers get yelled at like i do. i’m always the one singled out for some reason. they’re always told in a calm tone what they did and how to improve on it. i literally just have voices raised at me all the time. go faster, be better, you’re always a second behind and you’re holding everyone and everything up. normally i just shrug it off and don’t react at all. i don’t say anything to my managers at all. i rarely even respond. but, my breaking point was yesterday morning.

we had just gotten jelly, which we’ve never had in the store before. i gave a customer jelly for free without charging them because i had no idea we had to charge for it. i thought we could give it out like ketchup. my boss didn’t make a coffee with milk in it, so i almost gave out a mini bottle of milk. just so the couple could get out of the drive thru and put milk in their coffee because my boss is always stressing about the timer. but, we ended up trading it for a new coffee with milk in it. i gave a chocolate milk out that a couple asked for that my coworker didn’t add to the order. i was just yelled at and they made me switch positions with someone. they sent the person on front counter on break. my other coworker got sent home because we were talking and there was nothing else to do. everything was stocked and cleaned, but my boss said find something to do. so i was thinking i could go home on those terms.

i just had enough of being yelled at i couldn’t take it anymore so i just asked to leave. my boss said i couldn’t leave because that’s technically “job abandonment.” but two other coworkers got to go home. she made me sign a job abandonment form and i left. i just didn’t care. i apologised to me coworkers later on.

but, one of my references was my coworker on shift that has a temper. she got really mad and hasn’t responded to me. my other references are two managers and they always side with the head boss and kiss her ass. i’m not sure what to do and i don’t wanna come off as using people, but i really need references for a new job. i’m kind of stuck.",1,1768841289.0,problems,0,1.0,False

Although this was the smallest annual average increase since 2020, prices remained elevated in 2025, rising 19.9% over the past five years.

* Prices for services remained elevated, rising 3.1% in 2025, compared with a 4.1% increase in 2024.
* Prices for goods rose at a faster pace in 2025 (+0.8%) compared with 2024 (+0.3%).
* Prices for energy declined 5.7% in 2025, following a 0.6% decrease in 2024. The largest contributor to the 2025 decline was an 8.6% decrease in prices for gasoline, mainly driven by the removal of the consumer carbon price in April 2025.
* Prices for groceries increased at a faster pace in 2025 (+3.5%) than in 2024 (+2.2%) on an annual average basis. Canadians paid 20.3% more for coffee and 7.1% more for confectionery in 2025.
* Prices for meat rose 5.8% in 2025, following a 3.0% increase in 2024.
* Shelter prices rose to a lesser extent in 2025 (+3.0%) compared with 2024 (+5.7%)ser extent in 2025 (+3.0%) compared with 2024 (+5.7%). Price growth in mortgage interest cost slowed to 5.3% in 2025, down from a 20.1% increase in 2024.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% on a year-over-year basis in [December](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/260119/dq260119a-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-cpi-ipc&utm_content=personalfinancecanada), following a 2.2% increase in November.

The year-over-year acceleration in the all-items CPI was driven by the temporary Goods and Services Tax (GST)/Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) break that began on December 14, 2024. This resulted in monthly declines for the exempt goods and services, which have now fallen out of the year-over-year movement, putting upward pressure on headline CPI growth.

* Year over year, higher restaurant prices were the largest contributor to faster growth in the all-items CPI in December 2025. Prices for food purchased from restaurants rose 8.5% in December, compared with a 3.3% increase in November.
* Despite being unchanged month over month, prices for food purchased from stores rose 5.0% year over year in December. Coffee (+30.8%) and fresh or frozen beef (+16.8%) remained the largest contributors to the increase.
* On a year-over-year basis, prices for gasoline fell 13.8% in December after a 7.8% decline in November. The larger decline was due to prices falling 7.1% month over month in December, following a price increase in November which coincided with various refinery and pipeline disruptions.

Même s'il s'agit de la plus faible hausse annuelle moyenne observée depuis 2020, les prix sont demeurés élevés en 2025; ils se sont accrus de 19,9 % au cours des cinq dernières années.

* Les prix des services sont demeurés élevés; ils ont augmenté de 3,1 % en 2025 après avoir progressé de 4,1 % en 2024.
* Les prix des biens ont augmenté de façon plus marquée en 2025 (+0,8 %) comparativement à 2024 (+0,3 %).
* Les prix de l'énergie ont reculé de 5,7 % en 2025, après avoir diminué de 0,6 % en 2024. La baisse des prix de l'essence (-8,6 %), principalement attribuable à l'élimination de la tarification du carbone pour les consommateurs en avril, a contribué le plus à la diminution en 2025.
* La croissance des prix dans les épiceries s'est accélérée en 2025 (+3,5 %) par rapport à 2024 (+2,2 %) sur une base annuelle moyenne. Les Canadiens ont payé le café (+20,3 %) et les confiseries (+7,1 %) plus cher en 2025.
* Les prix de la viande ont progressé de 5,8 % en 2025, après avoir augmenté de 3,0 % en 2024.
* Les prix des logements ont augmenté dans une moindre mesure en 2025 (+3,0 %) comparativement à 2024 (+5,7 %). La croissance du coût de l'intérêt hypothécaire a ralenti pour s'établir à 5,3 % en 2025, en baisse par rapport à la hausse de 20,1 % enregistrée en 2024.
* Les prix des loyers ont également augmenté de façon moins prononcée en 2025 (+5,0 %) par rapport à 2024 (+8,2 %) et la croissance des prix a ralenti dans toutes les provinces. Même si la croissance a été moins marquée en 2025, les prix des loyers ont augmenté de 28,5 % depuis 2020 à l'échelle nationale.

L'Indice des prix à la consommation (IPC) a augmenté de 2,4 % d'une année à l'autre en [décembre](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/260119/dq260119a-fra.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-cpi-ipc&utm_content=personalfinancecanada), après avoir progressé de 2,2 % en novembre.

L'accélération de la croissance de l'IPC d'ensemble d'une année à l'autre est principalement attribuable au congé temporaire de taxe sur les produits et services (TPS)/taxe de vente harmonisée (TVH), qui est entré en vigueur le 14 décembre 2024. La mesure a entraîné des baisses mensuelles des prix des biens et des services exemptés de TPS/TVH

* D'une année à l'autre, la hausse des prix dans les restaurants a contribué le plus à l'accélération de la croissance de l'IPC d'ensemble en décembre 2025. Les prix des aliments achetés au restaurant ont augmenté de 8,5 % en décembre, après avoir progressé de 3,3 % en novembre.
* Bien qu'ils aient été inchangés d'un mois à l'autre, les prix des aliments achetés en magasin ont augmenté de 5,0 % d'une année à l'autre en décembre. Le café (+30,8 %) et le bœuf frais ou surgelé (+16,8 %) ont de nouveau contribué le plus à la hausse.
* D'une année à l'autre, les prix de l'essence ont reculé de 13,8 % en décembre après avoir diminué de 7,8 % en novembre. La baisse plus marquée est attribuable au recul des prix (-7,1 %) d'un mois à l'autre en décembre et s'est produite à la suite d'une croissance des prix en novembre, qui a coïncidé avec la perturbation des activités de divers pipelines et raffineries.",12,1768841286.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,2,1.0,False

\- first, how does airflow exactly work? I’m seeing conflicting answers saying that high airflow can roast the outside of the bean quicker than the inside, leading to what looks like a proper, say, medium roast but there’s only around 9% of development. Vs others say it cools the system

\- one of my biggest problems now is I can’t get long enough development % after FC, is this because high airflow in a sealed drum roaster increases roast time?

\- also another big question, I cannot seem to figure out this Brazil anaerobic (Brazil Fazenda Vila Boa – Natural — The Capitals Coffee), every time I roast, it ends up being a little lighter than expected and smells very peanuty.

The part I don’t say out loud is that I’ve started feeling this huge wave of relief when plans get cancelled, like my chest unclenches and I can finally breathe. A friend will text “hey can we rain check?” and I’ll type back “no worries!!” with a sad face, and then I’ll put my phone down and feel almost happy, which makes me feel like a terrible person. I used to be the friend who always showed up, always hosted, always remembered birthdays, always did the check-ins, the one who said yes even when I was tired. Somewhere in the last year, my social battery just started dying faster. Not in a dramatic “I hate everyone” way, more like everything feels loud. A casual coffee turns into two hours of performing: reacting, nodding, asking follow-ups, keeping the energy up. Even with people I genuinely like, I’ll catch myself watching the clock and thinking about how good it would feel to be in my own space, in silence, doing absolutely nothing productive. I feel guilty because nobody did anything wrong. My friends aren’t toxic, they’re normal. They send memes, they remember stuff, they invite me places, they mean well. But I’ve started saying I’m “swamped” becuase it sounds acceptable, like society understands busy, but it doesn’t understand “I don’t have the emotional bandwidth to be fun right now.” The worst part is that the lie works. People back off. They stop asking follow-up questions. I get to keep my quiet. And then I feel gross, like I’m slowly training everyone to expect less from me, but also I don’t know how to stop. I’ve tried being honest a couple times, like “I’m just low energy lately,” and people immediately worry, or they try to fix it, or they take it personally. So I default back to “work is crazy” and “deadlines” and “sorry I’m the worst.” I miss the version of me that got excited for plans, but I also don’t miss the constant pressure to be available and warm and on. And I’m scared that if I keep choosing relief over connection, I’ll wake up one day and realize I’ve quietly  drifted away from everyone who cared. I don’t even know what I’m confessing here, maybe just that I’m tired of acting like my alone time is a flaw I have to hide.

Chapter 4 - Cascade In Steps

On the very first day that he had woken up and found himself in the wrong place and time, searching, prodding along the clues to find out that what was happening to him was indeed happening. 

The thought that had crossed Henry’s mind was, “Finally, something good” no longer any fear of the unknown at what lies ahead, just a general calming sensation of having left something that he was becoming uncomfortable with. Thinking he was now facing a scenario in which he could change things, and in the end, that old man’s truth he had stared at could no longer be set in stone.

Henry got to experience the first watershed action he had taken, and within that action he always thought held a hidden strength guiding him along as the years passed. 

Marco and his companionship slowly filled the void that had been constantly gnawing at him, trying to justify its existence. But the truth was always lurking just out of eyeshot, like a saccadic ghost that the brain refuses to materialize and instead shows happiness layered over misery, snickering, whispering words of naught in a mute voice that only his heart could hear. 

All right, he had been selfish and self-serving on more than one occasion, but in Henry’s eyes that did not make him a monster, he wasn’t the only one out of billions that worked and lived happily on these same principles, so why is he the one being punished for it. This was just targeted harassment from Santa.

Principles, Morals, ethics and the human condition, Henry could go on and on for days on the subject and at the end change the mind of everyone willing to listen that it wasn’t him and the way he lived that was at odds with the people and connections around him, no, that was just how life worked. 

But yes, there was something that had happened that seemed to account for all four words. Was it deliberately and meticulously planned to inflict sorrow and harm? Now that the situation had changed, bringing a different outcome, Henry felt sick, as it might make him appear an unfeeling psychopath. While he was going through this inner monologue and walking down regret lane, Henry got startled by the knocking on his car window and opened his eyes to see Marco with a worried look on his face.

‘Hey, came to check up on you, Marcy called before her plane left and told me, you were not…. Well?’ Marco opened the car door, and Henry felt the cold air wash over him, bringing him back to his senses.

‘I’m in the mood for a Diner breakfast, you can drive’ Henry switched seats and watched him climb in hesitantly. Considering the events of last night, awkwardness firmly set the mood.

In the diner parking lot as soon as they came to a standstill, Henry was out of the car walking towards the door. Things were dawning on him, and none of it felt good. ‘Why are you so calm?’ Marco called from a few feet back.

‘Just looks that way, come on’ Henry walked in and took the nearest booth to the door, Marco sat opposite, and they waited for the server who came just after a few minutes from them taking a seat, the place was almost empty and calm.

‘Eggs sunny, bacon, toast and coffee, black,’ Henry told her and waited for Marco. ‘Just black coffee thanks,’

When she went to get ring up their orders Henry just stared straight at Marco’s face, eye to eye, he could see that this was making him pretty uncomfortable, which was not the point of why he was staring, there was a coin toss happening inside his mind, and Henry was waiting to see which side it landed on, both sides of his metaphorical coin were heads though.

‘You wanted to know why I am so calm after last night; this had already happened for me before,’ Henry found a glass full of sugar packets on the table, picked two and fidgeted with them.

‘WHAT? I thought Marcy was your first actual relationship?’ Marco replied, surprised.

‘I meant being a shit human being.’

‘All right?!?’ The confusion at the out of left field remarks, contrary to what Marco thought they would talk about, was a humorous look on his face. What was Marco thinking? Henry wondered.

‘Want to hear everything?’ Henry asked.

‘Okay, but you know you need an actual therapist for things like this.'

‘You catch on quickly, huh? But you know, a truly crazy would never know that he is in fact crazy.’

‘Depends on the type of crazy,’ Marco answered.

They went silent when the server approached with the orders and spent a few more minutes eating in silence; it was a singular calming moment from the prior hectic hours of being thrown around time and space, and it was still coming for him, there are more events that he needed to be punished through, but before the next scripted scenario happened Henry wanted Marco to hear something.

‘You know people who cheat well? They have happier marriages and relationships,’ Henry started abruptly, surprising Marco, who seemed to have been deep in thought, nursing his coffee slowly.

‘What do you mean, cheat well?’

‘I mean, they hide it so well that if anyone ever finds out, it’s usually when they are old and on a deathbed confessing to a nurse. I’m saying if no one ever finds out, did the cheating even happen?’ Henry scraped a bit of bacon back and forth on the plate. It left a greasy trail, a greasy trail of slimy sickness just like me, Henry thought.

‘Is this supposed to be Schrodinger’s cheating? Write a paper on it,’ Marco laughed.

‘I don’t think that applies…. Besides that, I did that garbage, yeah, and I justified it well, no ounce of guilt, clean conscience and all. When I want something, I work for it, and when I work hard for something, the reward at the end is deserving, yeah? I deserve things that make me happy, and I will get it, well I will try harder than most,’ Henry stopped, placed that bit of bacon in his mouth and looked to his right out the window to see a young couple going through the first throes of love, being handsy, calling each other cute names and light teasing, they walked towards the road and disappeared around the corner.

‘…..’ Marco seemed to search for something appropriate to say, but nothing was coming to him.

‘Cheating in the moment made me happy. I was getting something I wanted, just like everyone else in the world, not so after the fact, months and years man, those things that I did, slowly eroded me and my ego,’ Henry sighed, he felt cold and sweaty, nervous and sick.

‘You lack morals and empathy?’ Marco finally found some words.

‘I am not a sociopath or a psychopath, Marco. Don’t insult me, at least don’t think I am?!? Last night when I told her I didn’t love her, watching her face when I said it made me bite my tongue, I mean really get a bite in and fill a bit of my mouth with blood, so no, I have all the feelings that you have,’ Henry remembered it was the cheek, but the saying stands.

‘Wait? Are you okay to eat?’

‘Fine, now don’t worry, moving on, when I think of people, like you and Marcy, you two feel weird with how you behave,’ Henry looked down at the plate, only a piece of toast left, he set it aside and started on the coffee.

‘Me and Marcy are actually pretty normal, ethically and morally compared to most people, I have the same destructive urges, but you act on them thinking of only yourself and what you deserve, normal people, me, we think of our loved ones, the affect we would have on the relationships and resist them, nothing is ever worth hurting someone that devotes their life to you Henry,’ Marco smiled and Henry thought why was he smiling? Was he proud of himself?

‘Isn’t living like that boring?’ Henry asked.

‘No? Living a life devoted to someone and working hard to make them happy and watching them doing their best for me makes me happy; that is heaven, man, heaven on earth.'

‘So, there is something wrong with me?’

‘Wrong? Maybe not; everyone has their own views on happiness, not wrong so much as hurtful to the people who love you,’ Marco sighed.

‘A few years from today, you are going to meet someone wonderful, pretty, hot and sexy as fuck. This girl you meet has a sick family member that is in and out of the hospital, things get bad and you come to me, and ask me for money, and at this point in our lives I would have been promoted twice and would make an obscene amount that I can provide this to you easily. But I don’t; I secretly contact your girlfriend and offer it to her in exchange for sex. She obviously takes the offer and dumps you later out of guilt, Marco…. You are broken and dependent on me completely, and in my head I justify it as having achieved two goals: banged a hot chick that was out of bounds, got a friend tied to my waist. Then you get liver failure from being a junkie and an alcoholic and end up at the bottom of the transplant list and eventually die. During this period, I never visited you once and instead spent my time at tourist hot spots around the world banging young hotties.’ Taking a deep breath, Henry looked at Marco’s absurdly confused face.

‘Holy FUCK,’ he whispered, mostly to himself. ‘We should take you to the hospital.’

‘Look at me. I did all those things with a sane mind and on purpose. I fucking loved every minute, being the bigger man. Getting what I wanted whenever I wanted, but you know, you died, and I found myself lost, rudder to the wind, floating in directions the wind took me. The happiness of living like that had diminishing returns the sicker and older you get’ Henry looked to the right and at the reflection of himself on the window surface, stone and unfeeling on the outside, inside was the same, empty. Henry remembered the nostalgic feeling of being inside this same bubble of an empty void from those days before the past threw him back, a void that wouldn’t let anything warm and comforting interact with his flesh.

‘But can I tell you something else? I think that person and the person sitting here now are two different people, the point in my life I actually felt like I wasn’t a decent human being was the point in which you died, you did actually leave something for me, a gift to keep at my side,’ Henry stopped, Marco say something, anything.

‘This all sounds very disgusting and cruel, but understand something, Henry, I know you, we grew up together, you had a horrible, selfish attitude as a child’ He threw a bag of sugar into Henry’s lap. ‘But I always wanted to stay with you and wait for the day you would become a brother to me, that day happened when I needed it, and I see you now, understanding that maybe you are in the wrong, let’s work on this together, yea?’

‘Is it that fucking easy?’ the things he said baffled Henry; the entire conversation should have bothered him. He said he felt disgusted, but what then? Forget and forgive things to come? He would never stop. On the day he was painting Henry, he felt it from Marco. He would never stop, and he was angry at himself for ignoring Henry. The day they met again as young men, he had looked, sounded and felt so happy.

‘I’m sorry,’ Henry sighed.

‘Welcome, now let’s head to the hospital and get that noggin checked,’ Marco got up and went towards the door.

‘Won’t matter when I’m out that door’ Henry still went forward and stepped out to find himself knee deep in water, holding a fist full of coins, they were digging into the palm of his hands, and he was sobbing in the rain.

Chapter 5 - Resolutions In Rest

Going back earlier that day, he had wandered the streets looking for answers in the pouring rain. Henry remembered many minuscule happenings. The state of the apartment, the smells of festering garbage inside, all the movements from waking to the afternoon in which he made a cup of coffee and wandered outside to the balcony,  all this in a hazy daze. The most significant of all was the weather, as it had been raining for the last two days without end, sometimes slowing to a drizzle and then ramping up again into a windy, watery, blanketing gale.

Henry noticed that the wind died down sometimes; the drops came down in a straight line with breaks that formed sleet formations from the wind forcing some drops to come together high in the sky. They traveled down in Morse code spacing down to the city below, and all this he viewed at a grand scale from a twentieth- floor apartment of his now most recently purchased expensive apartment.

Marcus had passed away, and Henry noted that this was now the thirtieth day since, and on the day that he had taken that last breath, Henry was on a Hawaiian beach, trying to woo a young woman that had caught his eye. He wasn’t successful in this endeavor; as the years passed, the wrinkles multiplied, the women he could court to bed diminished.

The day his plane landed, he was notified by close friends and family that Marcus had passed during the night. And there was already a voicemail in Henry’s inbox from a few days before. So he might have known that the end was fast approaching and needed to vent some frustrations, let Henry know some truths. 

It was something he had expected, and not a surprising choice from Marco. But every time that he opened his phone to play that message, Henry’s feet went cold, hands went clammy, cold sweat formed at his back. He felt a primal, icy fear of hearing what he had to say. A dying man’s curse, and a close one at that, would be something that could tear a person apart at the seams. 

Below all that in the deep dark pits of his heart, there was a little whisper sowing a sad song about losing something indescribable, he couldn’t picture how this felt or attribute an image to it, something so foreign to the truth of the man that he knew he was.

And now in that lawn chair, on that balcony, watching the rain obscuring parts of the city in its watery imitation of fog. With the heavy whistling and tapping of the droplets on glass, brick and metal reverberating to create a melancholic song all around him, Henry bit the apprehension and dread down into his gut and opened the voicemail. 

What was it that awaited him, admonition? Anger? Rage? A depressive rant from a person wasting away because of the way Henry had puppeteer’d him into a life of chasing hollow comforts to fill an aching void of sorrow and suffering with liquid poison. 

It could be a thousand things. He felt fear crawl back up into his throat again and retake residence. Henry took a deep breath and pressed play, anyway. The voice was clear but weak. Marcus cleared his throat on the recording.

“Henry, Its me Marcus… Marco, First off I’m not angry that you didn’t want to stay and watch me waste away into nothing, I prefer you remember me in health yea, but these next words please hear them, I know you had a rough life, losing your parents so early, no one to guide you as you became an adult, drifting around learning the world on your own, the good and the bad. And how to survive a world so harsh, to everyone, and you found this skewed and broken way of making human connections and working them to your own benefit, it wasn’t wrong just unethical I think -some coughing and sounds of taking deep breaths- you were an awful friend and companion but, I still loved you like a brother…. More than one when I saw you for real, thank you for saving me and being my fall back through all those dark days, I have to leave now, and it pains me I could never do the same for you, be strong man, be good and be healthy, love you always,’

He wasn’t surprised. The lack of surprise surprised him more than anything. Henry gazed at the phone, massaged his temples, and softly cursed the heavens.

There are invisible threads that Henry follows in life. They spiral out from him in all directions, and the locations they lead to are determined day by day on what he wants to do that would be entertaining, a good time waste, or exciting. At the end of that voicemail, all those threads for the foreseeable future had just burned to cinders, leaving him swaying back and forth on a rudderless ship on a planet without a destination to dock.

Henry felt like he needed to move to feel something, so he walked over to the kitchen, rummaged through the drawers for a plastic bag, placed his phone inside it and walked out the door. 

At the building lobby he paused for a moment before walking straight into the rain, the first drops that contacted his skin was seething cold and made him break out in a shiver, but as the rain kept on coming, washing him over and drenching him head to toe. The cold was accepted as a good enough replacement for a feeling that he wanted to hide deep inside, one he needed to forget existed.

Walking along the road, watching people hurrying around trying to escape the rain, cars passing by, kids hiding in the shade curiously watching an old man strolling through the pouring rain, hands behind his back, returning a smile when he caught them staring. Henry wondered when the world had become so cynical that people no longer enjoyed a simple walk in the deep cold rain.

Henry saw the park halfway through his walk. It had a fountain in the middle, one famous in the city for making wishes come true. Just toss a coin and make a small wish and someday it comes true, was the saying behind it.

He walked over and stood at the edge. Inside, glinting with silver and copper, were coins of all sizes. Usually, the homeless would have taken most of them, but today there were quite a few left inside. Henry climbed in, leaned over into the water and dragged his hands across to gather them up, and came up with two fists full of coins and shoved them straight into his pockets, got out positioned himself at the edge and thought “this is stupid”

‘I am fine, I am,’ he whispered to himself, shivering. He took one coin, held it out and flipped it in. ‘Give Marco back’

Having said it out loud, Henry found a deep rage burst out at the thought of all that he had done, all that had happened. ‘I am NOT a shit person. I did not force him to drink, look at me, I AM fine’ He grabbed another coin, held it out and flipped it into the fountain.

‘I wish for Marco to be back please’ He tossed a few more, one after the other.

‘That woman was a bitch too,’ he screamed at the fountain. ‘I forced nothing out of her; I did not pin her down and force myself…. It was an offer that she took; it benefited both of us…. It was a… transaction.’ Henry knew he was crying, but of all the reasons there were to cry about, he didn’t understand which one was breaking him. He took a few more coins out and threw them into the fountain.

‘I wish he were back…. Marco’ Henry waded in and turned one of his pockets inside out; the coins plopped in one after the other.

‘ITS LIFE isn’t IT? Not everything goes everyone’s way; some have to accept the failure and hurt, being underachievers and losers. I haven’t got everything I wanted either, Fuck you.’ He kneeled down in the water, hands on his head, grabbed his hair by the fistful and welcomed the feeling of pain whilst the cold of the rain washed over him. Henry opened his eyes a few minutes later to notice Santa had appeared at his side, a red umbrella in hand, a curious smile on his face.

‘You are quite intelligent, Henry.’ He spoke in that deep, jolly voice, but Henry could smell and taste the venom dripping inside the tones. Henry took another coin and tossed it in, looking straight into his eyes.

‘Give him back.’ They both stared at each other, one amused by the situation, the other full of rage at what was happening to him.

‘You are avoiding a significant part of what I wanted you to experience by confessing.’ As he said this, Henry noticed this person had no sway; he was rooted to the ground like a stone monolith, unmoving to nature, no worldly motions, no breaths. add to that, it was as though the elements shied away; this man felt strange.

‘It never mattered, all right, I get it,’ Henry got up and faced it. ‘If I had said the right things, made the right choices even after all the horrible things I did to them, both of them would have forgiven me, If I had sent her back home, she would have come back to me, but I threw her out into the night and she disappeared and god knows fuck happened afterwards. I destroyed people who loved me, and I never accepted the fact that he thought of me, ME? I don’t know; I never thought they loved me that much. Marco made little sense.’

‘So, so intelligent, and yet, so self-destructive.’

‘If this is a punishment, I deserve it, and I accept it’ Henry took a step forward, and then he took a step back.

‘Still not time, Henry.’ Santa started walking. Henry felt like he needed to follow and ended up doing so. He remembered when and where they were going. When he said it wasn’t time, Henry had remembered where it was, that time was waiting for him.

End - All In Time

They walked along, keeping a safe distance from each other. He knew this was not a person, but a thing. He confirmed Henry’s feelings when instantly it cleared the sky and made days pass with each step as they walked toward his building.

‘I was perplexed that you stood on a scale, and it balanced precariously without tipping to either side, Henry.’ His voice boomed, and the world around them stood devoid of life.

‘I made choices based on pros and cons, not evil and good, Marco knew, Marcy knew. I wasn’t trying to be a bad person,’ Henry replied to him. ‘Which is the reason for my success at work and in life.’

‘The expense being the destruction of love, if you thought about it as you are so clever, not everything is of benefit.’ He waited for Henry to open the lobby door. ‘You were the one eating heartily while everyone around you settled for the scraps that rained around your…. Self.’

‘Everyone who loved me loved me for their own benefit.’ Henry opened the door and saw a smile of satisfaction bloom on that face; it felt disgusting to see.

They walked in silence to the elevator, and down the hall to his apartment. Henry opened the door and walked inside. All the lights were off again; the only ones lit were the ones in his bedroom.

There should be a guest inside, and he remembered the conversation he had; they talked for hours about the past and the future. Henry felt a deep hurt and understood something. When he had woken up in the past, Henry had the idea of changing the ending. Rewrite things to be a better person, treat the people he knew he loved better.

Henry had never thought of them as irreplaceable or of having any direct influence on his happiness, and that made it easier to cope because he thought he could be hurt first, so he worked hard to keep these not as treasures, but as the ordinary that when life stole them, he could move on without it breaking down the door of his being and flooding his self that he could not see the light at the surface.

The only one with these conditions was Henry. The two others who loved him, gave that love unconditionally and with such selflessness that it had spilled over into his void and filled it to the brim, and even that changed nothing. Henry understood something; he was the one who had lived the way he did while knowing all this.

He walked through the door, ignoring the guest that he had come in with, and stopped at the sight of the other person frozen in time. He stood facing the bed, gun in hand. A bullet left the chamber and, while frozen, traveled in a straight line. Henry knew where his spot was in this scene, so he went over and took a seat on the bed and looked straight at the bullet heading for his forehead, a fitting end.

Henry looked over at the study table next to the bed, on a laptop was a video that would play on repeat security camera footage, the location was a room in southeast Asia, a room of a sex trafficking place, a mattress, a woman, Marcy. They were giving her drugs to keep her obedient, and she hid some to create a large enough dose to overdose on. The video showed the moment she died.

Marcy’s brother, an old man now, face twisted in rage and hate while he watched Henry take his last breath in the world, a devoted and kind man whom, had worked hard to find his sister, spent his entire life from the moment she had disappeared unwavering in his mission to find her, even if a tad bit too late, the guy was still an angel.

‘Is it time?’ Henry asked Santa.

‘Do you know that they both, Marcus and Marcy, both forgave you at the very end?’ He walked over and stood next to Henry, keeping clear of the coming bullet.

‘Probably they were really nice people,’ Henry said, confused about the point of stating the obvious right now.

‘But do you think you deserve it?’ He asked again. ‘No.’ was the straightforward answer.

He held out his hand for Henry to shake. ‘Deny the forgiveness given to you and shake my hand, Henry, accept what I am to give you in its stead.’

The last picture was a clear one; there were no doubts about all that had transpired to bring him to this ultimate finale of watching his own death. All those scenes had been his life flashing before his eyes, a life of taking advantage, ruining people's lives, living for his own amusement, and at the end, he wasn’t getting the punishment he deserved so this thing had to come to him person.

It showed him that the way he had lived had reduced and robbed two people of fulfilling happy lives, and these two people, even after knowing what he was, how he had behaved, had wished that he would not suffer after death. ‘Screw it,’ he whispered to himself. The thought that ran through his head was that if he took this thing’s hand, he would never see them again. They were probably waiting even right now, arms outstretched to embrace him when he arrived, wholly forgiving, wholly loving.

Henry took the hand in acceptance and watched its skin boil. Smoky steam rose, and blood dripped to the floor.

‘Is it time?’ Henry asked again. In his heart, he said a small apology to both of them for accepting this outcome, but there was no way he could face them and not see the regrets of his failings, his choices that had ruined them every day into eternity, that was another type of hell that superseded the one he had just accepted now.

‘Yes, Henry, it is time.’ Time went forward.

Looking for cafes where a mom (me) can sit and have a coffee with a friend, while letting my toddler play. He's just 15 months, so not exactly ready for a big-kid situation like at Bingeman's.

I'm aware of the small play kitchen corner at Seven Shores in Uptown (love that), and the Recharge & Play spot also in Waterloo (on my list), but I wondered if any parents or caregivers could share any other places they know.

Most cafes near me don't even have high chairs, never-mind a zone where kids can hang. He's a curious and busy guy, so dedicated kid-friendliness is really valuable (compared with trying to control him in a cafe with like... ceramics on display in low open shelving).

I've never had much sense for interior design, mostly because I've never had any money for any actual furniture. This is my upstairs living room, the house is a split level and there is also a downstairs basement living room that will be the TV room. ALL of this furniture in this room was left in the house, except the blue couch, and the little buffet thing with plants on it. I also don't really have any money still, but I'd love for this room to look cohesive. I am imagining it more like a sitting room where people just talk or drink coffee, no TV. I also had a thought to put hardwood floor down in here, the carpet is nasty needs to go anyway, and make half the room with the hutch on the wall a dining room and split the other half into a sitting area.  The house has no dining room and the table is crammed in the small kitchen. Idk this house is weird and I don't really understand how the designed it for functionality but I still really love it, and our yard is bomb. I like boho style with velvet, jewel tones, hanging plants, macrame, crystals , granny stuff. But literally everything in this room can go. I'd like to keep the giant vanity because it's part of a really nice 3 piece set they left but I have no where to put it at the moment.

1qh8z3p,https://i.redd.it/mw3up8ry0ceg1.jpeg,Tiny tan specks on wall,"I noticed several tiny (<2-3mm) specks on my wall. Beige/tan brown, looks at first like residue splatter from a coffee drink.

Used a damp cloth/409 & they wiped off. Some are stubborn & only come off with a magic eraser, although some do not fully remove. They keep returning, though - same basic area of wall, only one area of one wall in one room.

Note: room is NOT damp in any way. (In fact, my apartment gets SO dry in winter that I keep meaning to buy a humidifier.)

I Googled ""tiny brown specks on wall"", and some of the results suggested it was some kind of occurrence from latex-based paint called ""surfactant leaching"". The paint on this wall is Behr or Glidden, can't remember which. Used the same brand in another room (both rooms repainted at same time); not seeing these spots there. But it has been at least 8 months since these two rooms were painted, and these spots just started maybe a month ago.

Could these be mold or other issue in a fairly dry environment? Or is it something else weird that I need to get professionally addressed? 🤢 Or is it simply surfactant leaching that is appearing due to the change in weather to winter, and they're appearing because my apartment has gotten hot & dry? 🤔

1qh8xys,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1qh8xys/advice_needed_for_sahm/,Advice needed for SAHM,"I’m not sure what to do and whether I’m being selfish or my husband is or what’s up or what’s down at this point. Maybe you can help. 

In January 2025, my husband agreed to move out. We’re on one income and money is EXTREMELY tight. I’m a stay at home mom of twins. He moved into his parents house. He refused to have the kids spend more than one night there because our daughter wasn’t doing well with the change and for him it made things too permanent I guess. So I had the kids at our house every night except one and he would see them a couple nights a week after work and drop them off. I’m not saying it was easy on him, but part of the reason our marriage is in trouble, is that he doesn’t help me with the mental load of our family. I mow the lawn, I pay the bills, I do the meal planning, clothes/food shopping and inventory, cleaning, etc. the list goes on.  So while he was gone until November 2025, I held the weight of everything while he slept at his mom and dads, had dinner made for him there, didn’t have to clean, no lawn to mow, and barely any kids time. It made me even more resentful.

Fast forward to now. He moved back in on his own and I was so exhausted I didn’t argue. We weren’t getting along but I just became so friggin weak. He never asked. I had to leave for a weekend and asked him to be here with the kids and he ended up just staying. I should’ve spoken up but honestly having another adult around was a relief. So I started the cycle of blaming myself again.  It took all of a month while I was running around handling Christmas and picking up odd jobs during the day while the kids are at kindergarten and paying the bills and grocery shopping and door dashing at night, etc, to realize that this man hasn’t changed a single bit. He will always need a mommy.  And I’m exhausted.  So I asked him to move out again and he refused (his right). I have no where to go. He has his parents. So because he is refusing to leave, I have put a schedule together where on the times he’s not working, we switch off nights. So I go sit in my car in parking lots.  On the weekends I spend entire days in my car. I use the bathroom at gas stations or I just spend money I shouldn’t on a coffee to use a decent restroom.   On his time off from the kids, he goes to his parents. The place he refuses to move to. It pisses me off beyond belief.

So I’m basically homeless now part time, I’ve been doing carpentry jobs for people, I door dash, and when I am home, I have to clean, cook, etc etc. I’m still doing it all.  But under his boot on my neck. And the entire time, this man keeps telling me he loves me and refuses to leave because this marriage will somehow work. Like he’s going to somehow show me. I’m like dude this cannot be real life.  I want to go back to a full time career because I just want to be able to afford my own place.  But he won’t take the kids more than outside of his work hours.  My career (besides carpentry) is nursing. I was a school nurse and would need to go back to those hours which means the kids go into before school care. They’ve been through so much change. It just worries me. 

So I have the kids in the mornings and get them to school. I do some carpentry work at peoples houses or get work done at our house, and then if it’s his night I leave and go door dash or just sit on a parking lot.  We are supposed to be filing bankruptcy this month but I left that on him and honestly, I’m not going to take on this burden. He can deal with that.  The bankruptcy will get us no where. I HAVE to go back to work. He tells me that when I finally divorce him he’s going to make sure he has his kids 50% of the time. Which is funny because he won’t take them for that amount of time now. I’ve asked him to go ahead and start now then. And yet, here we are.

Sorry this is long. I guess the way he sees it, is he’s not leaving because he found out the courts will look at him leaving as abandoning. Which I understand. But also, it’s ugly around here. He insists that if he takes the kids 50/50 then he’s having his 75 year old parents at our house at 6:30am every day to get them off to school.  I don’t have a job yet so I’d literally be here and that’s just weird. So I end up torn. I’m not going to make his parents do that and have the kids deal with that while I’m sleeping because it’s my “day off”. But also, it keeps me in the space of not getting a job because I might as well keep taking the kids while he’s working. I feel so stuck. 

Last thing I’ll mention is we not only are broke, can’t afford divorce, I can’t get him to move out, I have no where to go, can’t get the schedule to make sense, but I also have my son from a previous relationship who is 18 living here while going to college.  So I really want the house in the end. I have three kids and I have no clue what I’m going to do. I let go of my career. I can’t seem to get back into things. I’m so afraid I’m hurting my

Kids.  And he just goes off to work every day and sticks his head in the sand. I just need help an don’t know what to do.

To me, it makes sense for him to go, take his kids 50% of the time if that’s what he wants in divorce, and allow me the chance to get a job and get my feet off the ground. Then we can afford divorce, and we can decide who gets the house later. But him not leaving is keeping me stuck. Is there anything I am missing? A loophole of some sort?

1qh8xxy,https://i.redd.it/q4vw8wg12ceg1.png,AI Systems That Were Fundamentally Incapable Of Lying To Us,"I Read Lev Goukassian's 50-Page Document About ""Preventing AI Hallucinations via Ternary Moral Logic (TML) and Mandated Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Control Architectures"", So You Don't Have To.

Look, I need you to understand something right off the bat: I didn't choose this document. The document chose me. It arrived in my inbox at 3:47 AM on a Tuesday because of course it did, with a subject line that simply read ""URGENT: THE FUTURE OF AI SAFETY"" in all caps, sent from an email address I didn't recognize. My sleep-deprived brain, still half-convinced I was dreaming, decided this was a totally normal thing to open. Fifty pages later, I emerged from my apartment a changed person, blinking in the sunlight like some kind of basement-dwelling cryptid who'd just discovered that yes, the sun does in fact still exist.

The document started innocuously enough. ""Hallucinations as an Execution-Time Control Failure."" Okay, I thought. That's reasonable. AI makes stuff up sometimes. We've all been there. We've all asked ChatGPT for a recipe and received instructions that would violate the Geneva Convention. But then, THEN, Lev Goukassian (and I picture him as a wizard now, there's no going back) dropped the thesis that would consume the next six hours of my life: AI doesn't hallucinate because it's stupid. It hallucinates because WE FORCE ITy,  TO ANSWER WHEN IT DOESN'T KNOW THINGS.

This was my first ""oh no"" moment. It was like watching someone explain that your car keeps crashing not because you're a bad driver, but because someone welded the brake pedal to the floor and replaced your steering wheel with a motivational poster that says ""JUST KEEP GOING!"" I sat there, coffee growing cold, realizing that every AI system I'd ever used was essentially a highly educated college student during finals week who would rather fabricate an entire bibliography than admit they didn't read the book.

But Lev, I'm calling him Lev now, we've been through too much together, Lev wasn't content to just diagnose the problem. Oh no. Lev had SOLUTIONS. Enter the Ternary Moral Logic framework, which I can only describe as ""what if we gave AI the ability to say 'hold up, I need an adult'?""

See, normal AI operates on binary logic. Yes or no. Do or don't. Generate word salad or generate slightly different word salad. But TML introduced a THIRD STATE. The Sacred Pause. The Indeterminate State. State Zero. And when I read those words, ""Sacred Pause"", I had to put the document down and just stare at my ceiling for a solid ten minutes, because I realized I was reading about giving AI the computational equivalent of an anxiety attack, and calling it a FEATURE.

I called my friend Marcus at this point. Marcus works in AI safety, which means he spends his days trying to prevent Skynet while also trying to explain to his mother why he can't just ""turn off the bad robots"" like in the movies.

""Marcus,"" I said, my voice hoarse from not speaking to another human in hours. ""Marcus, I need you to tell me if I'm having a stroke or if I just read about someone who wants to build AI that can legally refuse to do things.""

""What are you talking about?""

""Ternary Moral Logic, Marcus. TML. The Sacred Pause. We're giving robots the right to remain silent.""

There was a long pause. ""Are you reading Goukassian's paper?""

""HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?""

""Oh god,"" Marcus groaned. ""How far in are you?""

""Fifteen pages.""

""Get out. Get out while you still can. Go outside. Touch grass. That document is a rabbit hole that ends with you trying to explain blockchain-anchored moral trace logs to your houseplants at 4 AM.""

Reader, I did not get out. I went deeper.

Because the Sacred Pause, this beautiful, ridiculous, absolutely necessary third state, it solved everything! When an AI doesn't know something, instead of making up a confident-sounding lie like a politician at a town hall, it just… STOPS. It enters State Zero. It pauses. It waits for a human. It's like installing a panic button on a sports car, except the panic button activates automatically whenever the car thinks it might be about to do something stupid.

State +1: ""Yes, I can do this thing confidently and correctly!"" 

State -1: ""Absolutely not, that violates seventeen laws and probably physics.""

State 0: ""I have CONCERNS and require ADULT SUPERVISION.""

I started imagining this in my daily life. What if I had a Sacred Pause? What if, when my boss asked me to ""circle back on synergizing our quarterly stakeholder engagement metrics,"" I could just enter State Zero and pause all execution until someone who speaks actual human language could translate?

But then I got to the section on Human-in-the-Loop intervention, and things got WILD.

See, the Sacred Pause isn't just philosophical hand-wringing. When State Zero triggers, the system MANDATES human intervention. It doesn't ask. It doesn't suggest. It STOPS THE ENTIRE EXECUTION PROCESS and sends up the Bat-Signal for a human operator. And if no human responds in time? The system defaults to State -1. Automatic rejection. ""Sorry, boss, no humans were available to authorize this questionable decision, so I'm just going to assume it's a bad idea and NOT LAUNCH THE MISSILES.""

I laughed so hard I choked on my coffee.

By page twenty, I was messaging Marcus updates like war dispatches from the front lines.

""They're implementing EPHEMERAL KEY ROTATION.""

""They're using BLOCKCHAIN ANCHORING.""

""Marcus, there are MERKLE TREES. Why are there MERKLE TREES in an ethics framework?!""

""I told you to stop reading,"" he replied.

""There's a section called 'The Hybrid Shield Architecture' and I think I'm in love with it.""

""Please go outside.""

But I couldn't stop. Because buried in all this technical complexity was something genuinely beautiful: accountability. Real, actual, no-take-backsies accountability. Every decision the AI makes gets logged. Every State Zero trigger gets recorded. Every human intervention gets cryptographically timestamped and anchored to a public blockchain where it lives FOREVER, immutable and tamper-proof, like a digital tattoo that says ""YES I MADE THIS DECISION AND YOU CAN'T GASLIGHT ME ABOUT IT LATER.""

The document called it the ""Moral Trace Log"" and I immediately started imagining it as a ghostly ledger that follows the AI around like Marley's chains, except instead of representing greed and sin, it represents every time the AI tried to tell someone that Abraham Lincoln definitely invented the iPhone.

Around page thirty, I made the mistake of telling my spouse about this.

""Honey,"" I said, bursting into the living room where they were trying to enjoy a peaceful Saturday. ""Honey, what if I told you we could create AI systems that are legally incapable of making stuff up?""

They looked up from their book with the expression of someone who's been through this before. ""Is this about that document?""

""How did you...""

""You've been in your office for six hours muttering about 'State Zero' and something called 'cryptographic anchoring.' I Googled it. I saw the page count."" They marked their place in their book with a resigned sigh. ""Hit me with it.""

""Okay, so imagine if every time an AI was about to hallucinate, it had to call a human supervisor, and if the human didn't answer, the AI just refused to respond at all, and ALSO every decision got recorded on a blockchain so there's a permanent, unfalsifiable record of every choice ever made, creating a chain of accountability that extends from the AI through the human operator all the way up to the CEO who signed off on deploying the system in the first place.""

They blinked. ""That sounds... extremely disruptive to normal operations.""

""EXACTLY!"" I was pacing now, gesticulating wildly. ""That's the POINT! Normal operations are BROKEN! We've been operating AI systems like they're magic eight balls with computer science degrees! 'Oh, you don't know if this medical diagnosis is correct? Just guess! What's the worst that could happen?' THIS PREVENTS THAT!""

""But doesn't that mean the AI would constantly be stopping and asking for help?""

""Only when it's uncertain! And that's GOOD! That's the whole POINT! We WANT the AI to admit when it doesn't know things! We want epistemically humble AI!""

My spouse gave me a look. ""You've been waiting to use 'epistemically humble' in a sentence, haven't you?""

""For YEARS.""

They went back to their book. ""Just don't stay up all night with this thing again.""

Reader, I stayed up all night.

Because around page thirty-five, I hit the section on Frozen versus Plastic Models, and my brain melted like a popsicle on a Phoenix sidewalk in August.

Lev, bless him, had declared war on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. Not because RLHF is bad, but because it creates what he called ""model plasticity."" The AI keeps learning and changing, which sounds good until you realize it means the AI that passed your safety certification on Tuesday might be a completely different AI by Friday. It's like if you hired a really competent employee, but every morning they walked in with a slightly different personality and skill set, and you never knew if today's version would be the one who remembered how to use Excel or the one who'd hallucinate a new formula that accidentally bankrupts the company.

TML's solution? FREEZE THE MODEL. Lock those weights down. Make the model immutable. And then, and this is the genius part, control its behavior through EXTERNAL RULES instead of internal weight updates. It's like the difference between trying to teach someone to be a better person by gradually modifying their brain chemistry versus just giving them a really good handbook and a supervisor who enforces the rules.

I sent Marcus a message: ""Frozen models with execution-time control. It's like constitutional law for AI.""

His response: ""It's 2 AM.""

""YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE HOUSEPLANTS.""

By page forty, I'd started taking notes. Not because I needed to remember this stuff, oh no, these words were BURNED into my neural pathways forever, but because I needed to process what I was reading. The document had evolved from a technical paper into what I can only describe as a manifesto for a future where AI systems are held to higher standards of accountability than most human institutions.

There were sections on new job roles that would need to exist. ""State-0 Resolution Operators."" ""Trigger Configuration Engineers."" ""Response-Time Auditors."" Lev was out here creating entire careers that didn't exist yet, job postings that would make HR departments weep: ""Wanted: Human capable of making complex ethical decisions under time pressure while a robot waits patiently in a deterministic non-output state. Must be comfortable with cryptographic verification of your decision-making process being permanently anchored to a public blockchain. Salary: Whatever it costs to convince you this is a real job.""

I imagined the interview process.

""So, you want to be a State-0 Resolution Operator?""

""Yes, I enjoy the philosophical challenge of resolving epistemic uncertainty within mandated time-bound frameworks while maintaining cryptographic proof of my decision-making process.""

""Great! When can you start?""

""I'm entering State Zero on that question and will require additional human input before committing to a response.""

""You're hired.""

Around 4 AM, I made it to the section on forensic investigation architecture, and I had what I can only describe as a revelation. This whole system, the TML framework, the Sacred Pause, the Moral Trace Logs, the blockchain anchoring, ALL OF IT, it wasn't just about preventing AI hallucinations. It was about creating a system where when things went wrong, you could go back and PROVE exactly what happened, who made what decisions, and why.

It was AI with a flight recorder. A black box for algorithms. Every decision, every uncertainty, every human intervention, recorded and preserved in cryptographic amber, ready to be analyzed after the crash.

I thought about every corporate disaster I'd ever read about. Every ""nobody could have predicted this"" and ""mistakes were made"" and ""we're investigating how this happened."" And I thought about how many of those investigations ended with shrugged shoulders and destroyed evidence and conveniently missing emails.

TML said: What if we made destroying the evidence literally impossible? What if we made the evidence PART OF A PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN that would require rewriting the fundamental laws of cryptography to alter? What if we created a system so transparently accountable that corporate malfeasance would leave a trail visible from space?

I may have cried a little. It was 4 AM and I was very tired.

The final sections dealt with deployment implications and standards compliance, which should have been boring but instead read like a battle plan for reforming the entire AI industry. Healthcare applications. Legal applications. Financial services. Defense systems. Each one with its own special circle of hell where hallucinations could kill people, bankrupt economies, or start wars.

And Lev was saying: ""We can fix this. We have the technology. It's this fifty-page document you're currently reading at an ungodly hour while your loved ones sleep peacefully, unaware that the future of AI safety rests on whether anyone actually implements these ideas.""

The document ended with architectural figures that I stared at until they burned into my retinas. Flowcharts showing the decision logic. Diagrams of the dual-lane latency architecture. Beautiful, complex, absolutely necessary diagrams that proved this wasn't just philosophy, it was engineering.

I closed my laptop as the sun started rising.

Marcus called me around noon. ""You alive?""

""I finished it.""

""The whole thing?""

""Every. Single. Page.""

""And?""

I thought about how to answer. How to explain that I'd just read a document that proposed solving AI hallucinations by giving AI the ability to admit uncertainty, forcing human oversight for ambiguous situations, and creating an immutable record of every decision that could never be erased, altered, or denied.

""Marcus, what if this is the actual solution? What if Lev actually figured it out?""

""Then we're all going to have to learn what a Merkle tree is.""

""I already know what a Merkle tree is now. That's the kind of night I had.""

""I'm sorry.""

""Don't be. I'm enlightened. I'm transformed. I'm going to start entering State Zero every time someone asks me to do something I'm uncertain about.""

""Please don't do that at work.""

""Too late. My boss just asked me to 'leverage synergies' and I told him I was entering an indeterminate state pending human clarification of what those words actually mean.""

""How'd that go?""

""I think I'm getting written up. But Marcus, MARCUS, what if everyone did this? What if we all just collectively agreed to pause when we didn't know things instead of making confident-sounding bullshit?""

""That's called 'being honest' and society has been trying to implement that feature for millennia with mixed results.""

""But we could MANDATE it! We could make it ARCHITECTURAL! We could...""

""You need sleep.""

He was right. I needed sleep. But I also needed the world to know about TML. About the Sacred Pause. About the possibility of AI systems that could admit uncertainty, request help, and maintain perfect records of their decision-making processes.

I thought about writing a summary. A brief, accessible explanation for people who didn't want to spend their entire night reading about ternary logic and cryptographic anchoring.

Instead, I wrote this.

Because some experiences can't be summarized. Some documents can't be condensed. Some nights of reading technical papers at 3 AM while having existential revelations about the nature of accountability and uncertainty in artificial systems can't be reduced to a bulleted list.

You had to be there. You had to read about State Zero and feel that little spark of hope that maybe, just maybe, we could build AI systems that were fundamentally incapable of lying to us. You had to see phrases like ""non-bypassable HITL triggers"" and ""automatic resolution to rejection on timeout"" and understand that someone out there was actually trying to build AI systems that couldn't be manipulated into doing the wrong thing.

I called my spouse. ""I'm done.""

""With the document?""

""With accepting AI systems that hallucinate. I'm radicalized now. I'm a TML truther. I believe in the Sacred Pause.""

""That's nice, dear. Did you sleep?""

""Sleep is for people who haven't discovered that we can anchor moral reasoning to the blockchain.""

""Please come eat something.""

I did eat something. And I did eventually sleep. But when I woke up, the document was still there. The ideas were still rattling around in my head. The vision of a future where AI systems could say ""I don't know"" and wait for help instead of confidently generating nonsense, that vision stuck with me.

I still work with AI systems that hallucinate. I still get made-up citations and fabricated facts and responses that sound confident but are completely wrong. But now, every time it happens, I think about State Zero. I think about what it would mean if the system could just... pause. If it could admit uncertainty. If there was a human in the loop who could help.

And I think about Lev Goukassian, writing his fifty-page manifesto, probably at 3 AM himself, probably fueled by the same desperate hope that we could do better. That we could build systems that were safer, more accountable, more honest about their limitations.

The document is still in my inbox. I've read it three more times since that first night. Each time, I find something new. Some detail about ephemeral key rotation or Merkle-batched anchoring or the dual-lane latency architecture. Some beautiful, complex, necessary piece of the puzzle.

Marcus asked me last week if I regretted reading it.

""Are you kidding?"" I said. ""That document changed my life.""

""It made you insufferable about AI safety.""

""I was already insufferable. Now I'm insufferable with a comprehensive theoretical framework and knowledge of cryptographic integrity mechanisms.""

""That's worse.""

""That's BETTER.""

And you know what? It is better. Because now when I see AI systems making mistakes, I don't just shrug and accept it. I think about how it could be different. About the Sacred Pause that could prevent those mistakes. About the accountability that could be built into the system from the ground up.

I think about State Zero.

And sometimes, when my boss asks me to do something ethically questionable or technically impossible, I take a deep breath, and I invoke the Sacred Pause in my head. I pause. I consider. I wait for clarity.

It doesn't always work. The world isn't designed for ternary logic yet. We're still stuck in binary thinking, yes or no, do or don't.

But maybe someday.

Maybe someday we'll all get to pause when we're uncertain. Maybe someday our AI systems will be humble enough to admit when they don't know things. Maybe someday accountability will be architectural, built into the foundation of our systems instead of bolted on as an afterthought.

Maybe someday we'll all live in State Zero, comfortable with uncertainty, waiting for the clarity that comes from honest human judgment.

Until then, I've got this fifty-page document. And I've got you.

Welcome to the Sacred Pause, friend. The coffee's cold, the sun's rising, and there's a Merkle tree somewhere with your name on it.

You're welcome.

Overall, things are really good. We’ve been together for over a year, I moved into his apartment about six months ago, and we just bought a house we’re remodeling together. We work in the same district, are building a life and social circle together, and share a lot of interests—working out, watching shows, gaming, making coffee, smoking weed, beach days, etc. He’s very rational, logical, and steady, which I see as huge positives long-term. I can picture him as a great father. We have good sex, similar values, and I feel safe and comfortable with him.

That said, I sometimes get waves of doubt that I’m trying to understand. They’re hard to explain and come and go. Sometimes I feel like we don’t have as much fun or laughter as I might want. He’s more introverted and not super into going out, especially in the winter, and I sometimes feel like I’m dragging him to plans he doesn’t really care about. I also value words of affirmation, and there are times I feel hurt or down when I’m not getting compliments or verbal affection. I’ve talked to him about this before, but not much has changed, which leaves me unsure how to process it. I’ll also add that during these waves, there are times I feel emotionally numb or less “in love,” like my feelings are temporarily dialed down. It always passes, but when it happens it really adds to the confusion.

I love him a lot, and the idea of breaking up genuinely makes me sad. I’m scared of regretting whatever choice I make. I also worry that chasing things like spontaneity, fun, or verbal affection elsewhere might mean giving up other things I really value, like stability, ambition, and cleanliness. I want him in my life and don’t want to lose him—I’m just not sure how to deal with this lingering doubt or whether it’s something normal in long-term relationships.

TL;DR: 23F in a loving, stable relationship with 27M and see a future together, but I get recurring doubts about fun, laughter, and verbal affection. Not sure if this is normal or a sign something’s missing—looking for advice.",1,1768840278.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

My husband is 36 and I’m 32 female. My husband had a job opportunity that he wanted and he talked to me about which I appreciate. But he went and told his manager he’s leaving without understanding his salary at his new opportunity. It was a cut which we knew but to the dollars and cents is way lower. He was excited and again told his manager and “new boss” he’s taking it. He didn’t sign anything. After talking to him I told him about our finances we or even himself  can’t live on his new salary of 2.8k to 3.5k a month hopefully. When we have full time day care, his car note is 900 and other bills for himself I can do my own bills. His current job pays great. Where he can afford all of that and more. So it hurt my heart to tell him that we have bills. I know his dream but I can help you find another opportunity, so he declined that job and said I was right, and thank you. Said I saved the family. He hugged me and the past few days been great. I’ve been loving and helped him with his car, letting him know to refinance bc it’s expensive. Even now for a non luxury car.

So fast forward today. At dinner I’m watching the baby eat. I left my water bottle on the coffee table. He was annoyed how the LR looked so he start to like panic straighten up. He’s movng my shoes, boot for my foot and all. He comes to my water bottle and said “here” I said no please leave it in coffee table.” He said “no you sitting over there.”

I said “I know but keep it over there.” He’s like fighting me - I forgot what he said next but I said “well your cup of water is right there in the coffee table too” And he said “I’m going back in there.” And I said “me too!!” He says “I’m going now though!” He said “I’m stop bc you trying to fight with me!”

I’m like annoyed I said no like leave my bottle there. So baby got done with food and I took her to him. I was annoyed. He’s like “you okay?” I said I was annoyed that you going back and forth with me about the water bottle.

He like upset and started to get mad. I just nicely expressed I was annoyed, and he mad bc I said that. He said sorry but it was not genuine. It’s like he saying it to be done. I walked away, and I came back to talk him why his vibe change? Why you mad? (Like I’m chasing his feelings(

And he didn’t give an answer. But just acting annoyed not looking at me. And him questioning why I came back in there. He’s annoyed I’m still talking about it. He says he didn’t care. I said I get you don’t care but I do. I felt unheard and challenge after a simple request.

He got mad, and I texted him and said I just want to be heard. Not be greeted with anger when I say that I’m annoyed with what you did. Understanding, I love you, I get you, look at my face. Not a hand rubbing head annoyed at me.

I said all that and he’s said okay sorry.

So I told him to come to the room to get baby. He comes in not say a word. Grab toothbrush and walked out. Not a hi baby or hi wife. it’s like that. So I walked out. like he giving me silent treatment,

And that makes me shut down even more. Like I’m stupid for helping him about that job should let him figure it out since he wants to yell at me and be upset. I wanted to talk about his finance tomorrow and I don’t need to do that now. I feel like he didnt respect me when I said no first time.

It’s always one sided. I try to help him allll the time. Tell him to reach out to payroll to see how much you get paid, help figure out a lower payment ( he wants this I’m not controlling these are things you would think about- like what my new salary. And he didn’t get a clear answer but told his boss he’s leaving for said job!) but today when I was having issues with my resume with Word format and he see I’m frustrated he’s like how about you Google it. It’s never him taking the step to try to research and help me. He knew what the issue was. But couldn’t take a moment to help me figure it out BUT I would help him. I would google it for him. Today literally made me sick. How stupid of a women am I. Always helping him, saving him. But he disrespect and don’t even help me. I even showed him the issue and he’s like idk! Not even trying to help me and he work in excel and word all the time.

I feel so stupid bc I’m so loving and kind and when I just want a small respect or even  if he doesn’t agree with me I still want understanding, a hey baby I see I may hurt you let me give you a hug, let’s put it behind us. Like I don’t get that. I get greeted with anger

AIO? Like would you be annoyed by that? Should I not bought it up when he asked? I feel like his response make things bad. I wasn’t pissed just annoyed",0,1768840199.0,Marriage,18,0.25,False
