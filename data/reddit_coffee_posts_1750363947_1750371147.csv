We use Square as our POS, and for most things, the integration works great. The biggest issue I'm running into is setting up our coffee recipes and modifiers to deduct ingredients and packaging from our inventory correctly.

We have about 10 specialty coffees with 12oz and 16oz sizes, hot and cold, and about 6 different milk options, all specified by modifiers in Square. Each size, temperature, and milk option has to deduct different items and different amounts of milk from our inventory. The cup type and amount of milk is determined by both the size and the temperature modifiers. The milk type modifier changes which type of milk is used. The standard modifier groups don't allow me to link modifiers together in this way. I have found a potential workaround to create grouped modifier options in each item individually, but setting them up is a huge time suck and a pain in the ass. I have to add a specific modifier setup for every possible combination of modifiers, otherwise it won't trigger correctly. This comes out to over a thousand combinations per drink times 10 drinks, which seems like an awful use of my time.

I have spoken with my Marketman trainer and another trainer who has the most experience with Square, and neither of them has been able to give me a good way to do it. They insist that I have to change my modifiers in Square to be able to correctly set up the modifiers in Marketman, but all of the methods they suggest will ruin the ordering flow for customers online and on our self-order kiosks.

Has anyone else run into a similar issue like this? How have you solved it or created any kind of workaround? Or do I just have to resign myself to having an inaccurate inventory or hundreds of hours of manual entry into the system?",1,1750370944.0,restaurantowners,0,1.0,False

1lfni6a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfni6a,We Teh BoomerZ Now: Gamer Milllennials Post-Boomer!,"Back in 2005-2006, I was a force to be reckoned with. At 24, I clawed my way to High Warlord as a Warlock in Vanilla World of Warcraft, a feat that demanded not just skill but an unholy dedication to grinding battlegrounds, mastering rotations, and navigating the brutal social politics of Azeroth. It was a badge of honor, a digital crown forged in sleepless nights and endless Alterac Valley stalemates. My guild revered me, my enemies feared my Shadow Bolts, and I felt like I’d conquered something eternal. Fast forward to 2025, and here I am at 44, a grizzled veteran of virtual wars, barely able to muster the energy to log into WoW’s latest expansion. The nuances and intricacies of modern WoW—its sprawling systems, layered mechanics, and relentless content churn—feel like a foreign language I once spoke fluently but have since forgotten. Instead, I’ve traded my felhound for a deck of digital cards, semi-retired as a Hearthstone professional, where the stakes are lower, the matches are quicker, and the mental load doesn’t feel like running a marathon in plate armor.

This, my friends, is the reality of being a millennial gamer in 2025. We’re the new boomers, not because we’re out of touch, but because we’ve been through the wars—literal and virtual—and we’re too damn tired to keep up with the kids. The gaming landscape has changed, and so have we. Millennials, once the bleeding edge of gaming culture, are now the ones shaking our heads at the complexity of modern titles, reminiscing about simpler times when a 40-man raid was the pinnacle of ambition. We’re post-Boomer, carrying the weight of nostalgia while grappling with the fact that our reflexes, patience, and free time aren’t what they used to be.

Let’s talk about Vanilla WoW for a second. It was raw, unforgiving, and gloriously imperfect. Becoming High Warlord wasn’t just about skill; it was about obsession. I spent hours theorycrafting, memorizing talent trees, and coordinating with my team to outsmart Horde zergs. The game’s depth was immense, but it was manageable—contained within a framework that rewarded persistence and cunning. I understood every tick of my DoTs, every resist chance, every soul shard’s purpose. That version of me thrived on the grind because it felt like a frontier, a place where I could carve out a legacy.

Now? WoW is a beast I barely recognize. The game has ballooned into a labyrinth of systems—covenants, conduits, mythic-plus affixes, and gear scores that require a PhD to decipher. I tried dipping back in a few years ago, lured by nostalgia and a free trial. Within an hour, I was overwhelmed, drowning in tutorials and tooltips. The game I once mastered had outgrown me, or maybe I’d outgrown it. At 44, with a career, a creaky back, and a dwindling attention span, I don’t have the bandwidth to relearn a game that feels like it’s trying to be everything to everyone. And I’m not alone. My old guildmates, now in their late 30s and 40s, have mostly scattered to less demanding pastures—some to Final Fantasy XIV, others to single-player RPGs or, like me, to the cozy simplicity of card games.

Enter Hearthstone. It’s my refuge, my semi-retirement gig. I’ve carved out a modest career streaming and competing in Blizzard’s digital card game, where a match lasts 10 minutes instead of 10 hours, and the meta shifts fast enough to keep things fresh but not so fast that I feel like I’m chasing a runaway train. Hearthstone scratches the strategic itch without demanding the encyclopedic knowledge or lightning reflexes of modern MMOs. I can build a deck, outsmart an opponent, and call it a day before my coffee’s gone cold. It’s not the adrenaline rush of leading a raid or sniping a rank 14 rival in Stranglethorn Vale, but it’s enough. It’s sustainable. And at this stage of life, sustainability trumps glory.

This shift isn’t just personal—it’s generational. Millennials grew up with gaming’s golden age: the SNES, the PlayStation, the rise of PC gaming, and the birth of MMOs. We were the ones who defined esports, who turned LAN parties into cultural touchstones, who made gaming a lifestyle before it was mainstream. But now, as we hit our 40s, we’re the old guard. The zoomers and Gen Alpha kids dominate Twitch and TikTok, speedrunning games we barely understand, while we’re out here waxing poetic about EverQuest corpse runs or the original StarCraft meta. We’re not irrelevant, but we’re not the vanguard anymore. We’re the ones buying retro consoles, firing up emulators, or settling for games that respect our time and aging joints.

The irony is, we’re not even that old. At 44, I’m still sharp enough to hold my own in Hearthstone tournaments, to read a meta and counter it with a rogue deck that catches opponents off guard. But the hunger for dominance, the drive to conquer every system and climb every leaderboard, has faded. I don’t need to be High Warlord anymore. I don’t need to prove I can master WoW’s latest raid tier or memorize a 20-button rotation. I’ve been there, done that, and got the epic mount to prove it. Now, I’d rather play a game that lets me log off without feeling like I’ve abandoned a second job. As T.S. Eliot once wrote, “We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.” So yeah, gamers are the boomers now—at least, millennial gamers are. We’ve explored the frontiers of Azeroth and beyond, only to return to simpler games like Hearthstone, where we can savor the familiar thrill of victory without the weight of a world on our shoulders. Let the kids have their mythic raids; I’ll be in the tavern, shuffling my deck, content to know this place anew. [HappyHavelock.com](https://HappyHavelock.com), dad! Redirected this for ya!

1lfnhyq,https://i.redd.it/cymfjsk9jy7f1.jpeg,dating as a passing/stealth troon (before srs) is still lonely & hellish,"I know it sounds privileged, but dating as a stealth pre op tranny is a miserable existence. 

You have guys who will throw themselves at your feet, buying you drinks & things, doing major PDA, etc. all until they find out you're trans.

Went on a date today with this guy I had met at a bar, got coffee, had a day at thrifts & then he wanted to come over. Told him to give me 5 mins to clean up a bit, I texted him that i was trans while I was inside, since i always disclose for safety & he didn't even respond 💀 I just saw that his car was gone & I was blocked on everything like 10 minutes after. 

This is like the 6th or 7th time this has happened, or they'll say they're okay with that, fuck me, and *THEN* block me on everything once they leave 😊 

And i know t4t is an option (and would do absolutely), but there's an inherent risk to be outed in that instance if the other isn't also stealth & i live in Texas, so it's hard to even find other stealth trans people.  Anyway, all that to say if you think passing/ being stealth makes your life inherently better, it's simply not the case. It is still lonely as fuck & iwnbarw.

 I will not be dating unless I can find a way to resurrect jim morrison or george harrison. 

 The overall lesson: being a tranny sucks no matter what kind of tranny you are (trvke) ",1,1750370870.0,4tran4,2,0.67,False

I will also change describing details in the story for the sake of privacy. Apart from that, I advise this is going to be a bit long.   
  
Some context first: I (22M) am kinda of an introvert that moved to Europe when was 15yo. Many things happened to this day but for keeping things short, I started studying an alternative formation to college after I dropped/got kicked from college. I tried college 2 years and those were by far the worsts year in my life. In a new town where I knew nobody, I made no friends except my roommate, Jake, who was and absolute angel and the only good thing I keep from those years. I come from a very conservative family where everyone graduate college, since they think people without a college degree are inferior or burden to society. Therefore, after dropping, I returned to my parents house, no college, no work. I felt like garbage and scum, I got depressed. I had no energy to get out of my bed, I stopped showering, eating sleeping. I got an unkempt beard and long hair because and felt no right to ask for money for a haircut. I got fat to the point one of my knees hurt when going upstairs. I spent months thinking how to unalive myself making it look like an accident. Thank god I have my bests friends, who are like brothers to me. The always supported me and they are the reason my unalive attempt failed. 

Since I couldn't try college again, I tried an alternate education. If college makes you an electrical engineer, this formation makes you an expert electrician. I was afraid this would be like college to, that I would fail and disappoint everyone and being alone in a classroom. I was wrong. I liked what I was studying and I met the best people in the world, they were so warming and polite. Always cheerful and would include you and help you in class. I made two of my actual best friends there. They encouraged me to improve. I got my hair cut, shaved my beard, started wearing better clothes and started using cologne. I started doing exercise too. I started hanging out, meeting new people boosting my self esteem.

All these changes made me feel a confidence I never had before and became more sociable. I met people through my family and relatives. I started hanging out and having a good time. This encouraged me in a way I never though It would be possible.

Now this is where the story starts. 2 years ago after a discord talk with my best friends from my natal country, we decided we wanted to take a step further and become more sociable. We set a goal that we had to do our best to try to make a friend over a complete stranger before the 3 month limit. After much consideration, I decided I wanted to talk to a girl. I saw this girl took the same bus as me and studied in the same place as me. I saw her sometimes on the halls and always with a smile, so I tough she could be my best option. I also liked her nose piercing, like it was cool.

The first time I talked her I saw the opportunity after she sat right in front of me in the bus. I asked her about her headphones since I was interested in buy ones. We just had a 2 minute talk about the headphones, how much does their battery last and the sound quality compared to 2$ earphones. I thanked her and the talk ender. After some research I actually liked them so I bought the newer model around a month after that conversation. I approached her again, she recognized me and greeted me with a smile. I thanked her for the recommendation and told her I really like them, we had a little chat again talking some stuff like battery for her lasts like a month but for me lasted 5 days since I love to hear music. I told her one thing I liked was the pairing sound wasn't the average robotic female voice, but guitar chords. She didn't believed me and asked me to hear herself. We exchanged headphones, and hers didn't sound like mine. We thought it was curious and before separating I asked her name: Je, and she asked mine, which she said it was a weird one. 

The next day after finish studying, I saw her at the bus stop and talked her. I told her that I though Je was as weird as my name, and she told me it actually stands for Jessica. She asked me what career I was studying there and we realized we had similar careers. She asked me if we had common teachers, so we just listed teachers and after that we kept talking on the bus all the way until she left. She was actually nice. Her language was kinda rude with many swear words like calling a place like a park ""a shthole"" just for being boring, but I mean, that's just language, she was totally cool and I genuinely thought I was making progress on being more social.

After that, I would not talk to her everyday, it's not like we were best friends. So I  or her approached 2 or 3 times, talked about our weekend and some other stuff. Those were lame conversations to be honest, and I was starting to get tired over the idea of being social as a responsibility rather a natural act of myself.

The next to last talk I had to her was again on a bus stop after class. That day, all carees had some sort of presentation about economy and business opportunities, even if our careers were not related. I saw Jessica with her group of friends, but she just went straight like she didn't know me. I didn't care honestly, she was with her friends and I was with mine. During the presentation she was sitting in front of me and on a little break, many classes escaped the honestly boring lecture. Only my class and next year class where there. After the lecture, we were to the same coffee where Jessica was with her friends. I didn't approach her, but we made eye contact again and she just pretended she didn't see me so I did the same.   
  
For context, on one of our talks, she told me she would never go to that caffe, and rather go to a supermarket down the street and buy some chocolate and coke that going to the coffee shop because she didn't like it.

It was later that day that I saw her at the bus stop as usual and tried to have a conversation with her. I asked about why she leaved the lecture and she just told me she was in the place to grab free samples of something. I laughed and told her a friend of mine was there for the same thing. She didn't reply and wasn't smiley as always. There was an long silence and after a momento I just asked ""so, what made you go to the coffee today? I thought you didn't li-"" I couldn't finish my sentence because she told me, in a annoyed (I think is the word, if roll eyes was a feeling) way ""Are you looking always where I am going or what??"". The direct English translations doesn't explain the feeling but in the language we were speaking it implicates me spying on her, like a perv. I of course said no, I knew she was there because we saw each other, I was in the lecture because of class and I was in the coffee because I always go there. I told her I just thought it was curious since she really emphasized how much she preferred not to go the coffee. She shut told me in an angry way ""I just felt like going today"". 

We were in that time of the year were you have one exam after another, so I thought maybe she is stressed, maybe she was having a bad day, or maybe she just doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Maybe I was wrong thinking I could talk with any stranger, and she has the right to tell me to stop if she feels annoyed, even tho she smiled to me before and started some conversations herself. I choose that idea and decided to not talk to her anymore except for one more time. The last time I just saw her in the hallway and told her that I just wanted to say one last thing, i told her I liked her piercing and she said ""thanks"" with a smile. That was the last time we spoke. If we saw each other on the hallways, she would pretend she didn't see me and I would do the same.

Flash forward to 2 year later, a week ago. I weight a lot less, dress much better and have a piercing. We are on the final stretch of the career. Some people have completed their subjects at the first try on march, and others like me, had to take a final exam of their failed subjects in june. I was in the coffee shop with my friends and went to the bathroom. Next to it were the guys from Jessic career, I recognized some faces, the kind you get used when walking on the hall. As I unzip my pant and I am about to pee, I get to hear a femenine voice say something along the lines of ""yes, the one with the pink hoodie that just entered the bathroom"".   
  
I was the one with a pink hoodie, then I realized it was Jessica's voice, she said something like ""don't talk to that guy, he's a weirdo"". She then started describing our interactions and boy, I promised you I wasn't prepared. She described me like I had some sort of autism(?, She was telling the table I molested her, always approaching and just  spitting information she didn't care about. You know how people mock other people by making this nose voice when saying ""aCtuAllY...🤓☝️""  or that people uses to make fun of people on the spectrum? well, she described me as that kind of person with that kind of voice. I remember she said something about the headphones conversation ""and one day he just appeared and told me 'heeY I bougHt tHeM🤓' and started talking sht about the headphones i couldn't care less about"". She was making fun of me and I could here al the table laughing at me. I was so embarrassed I couldn't even pee, I just stood there over 5 minutes trying to concentrate and ignoring, but I could clearly heard they were making fun of me. While I didn't get to hear everything, I did get to hear the comments about my clothes that day, so I think it is safe to asume the critics weren't just about my interactions with her, but myself completely.  After 5 minutes straight minutes of hearing stuff about me, just talking about how I must have some mental disability or lack friends. Something I could also hear clearly and confirms this is ""The last day he just told me something about my piercing and after that he stopped harassing me again"". My head was heavy. I was shaking and wanted to throw out. I went out the bathroom looking my phone pretending I was texting someone. After the conversation, the mental image of me on that table was basically the tv stereotype of a weirdo watches you from the distance because does not know how to relate to other people.

Now, I am not going to lie. That was hurtful. First, it was hurtful because I thought it was normal conversations. Make me realize the other person just felt uncomfortable all the time made me feel like absolute trash. I thought I was trying to make a friend and the other person only saw some perv stalker.

On second place, it was hurtful because I always thought I could read the room. Some life circumstances made me more aware of people's feeling. I was sure that I could identify someone feelings because of their face, their expressions, the way they act. You know, I could identify when a friend is not having his best day or when mum got home excited because dad gave her chocolates. This situation made me feel like I got it all wrong, and all I could think of was if I harassed someone else without even consider it

And the last one, it hurt because I felt bullied. If you are bullly victim, you know how you grow up and remember and say ""I mean, we were in primary school. It was not ok but at that age we all are idiots"" and you kind of forget. But gent you get bullied as an adult, man, it feel heavy, because you can't say the people mocking you have to grow, they are grown ups, and all the stuff they say are intended and on purpose. Realizing that in the bathroom made me feel so vulnerable, it made me back like Ego from ratatouille but in a bad, horrible way.

Now, I do respect her way of feeling, she has the right to do so and I can't force her to like me. But must of the stuff she said was altered to make me look like a creep. Like the headphones talk, It wasn't me showing out of nowhere spitting facts about headphones, I went to thank her, and she smiled back and talked back. She asked stuff, and I answered. She even asked to use my headphones to hear the guitar stuff, but she made it seems like I was talking all by myself and she was just listening annoyed.

I have talk with friends over this. They think I am paying much attention to the opinion of people I honestly don't know neither will see again, and while I agree to that part, I tell them that what still in my head is the fact  of harassing people without noticing.  
  
I know what being harassed is. In a sexual way and in other ways. I had to let people talk to me in public horrible stuff because of my accent, my citizenship, my skin color. I have a mother, a sister, a grandma and aunts. I have heard how horrible harassment is and know that is horrible, and wouldn't wish it to no one never. I don't want to be considered that, that is absolutely horrifying and can't get that out of my head.

I don't feel like vomiting now when I think about it, but it is really affecting my mental health. My friends think I am overreacting but idk, all I want is that people don't think I am a bad person.

Still 1 day out from my period but my lord what a difference! 
Here is what I implemented: 
This month: 
- regular walks/runs 
- prebiotics everyday 
- limiting excessive alcohol intake 
- increasing fresh vegetable intake and limiting processed foods
- maintaining stable sleep (where my child allows)

Pm week:
- 1 coffee a day 
- less salt
- runs every second day 
- at least 1-2 meet ups with close friends to talk 
- no alcohol 

I feel so much better this week and am hoping this turns the tables for me even if it is only sometimes. ",2,1750370594.0,PMDD,0,1.0,False

Does anybody have tips on asking her if the opportunity arises? I don't think it's a good idea for either attending to witness it (I wonder if this would be seen as unprofessional for me, and I feel she could be uncomfortable with her attending standing right there).

Or would asking her to eat lunch with me not be seen as unprofessional if I did it in earshot of the others? I think it'd be clear what my intentions are though because we don't work directly with each other and I have no other reason to be talking to her.",0,1750370485.0,medicalschool,1,0.5,False

I am of course planning to discuss this with my medical professional however I was wondering if anyone has experienced the same thing as me!

I dont have a coffee everyday but i like to treat myself to a starbucks oat shaken brown sugar espresso once a week. I have noticed that every single time i have a coffee i have at least one violent hypo that day ( and i mean badddd).
I have began to not inject whilst having it and still a violent hypo few hours after and i mean fighting for my life. Really bad anxiety, legs like jelly, flappy hands and of course levels that i cannot bring up with any type of food/ gluco tablets.

I was planning to buy Encore ESB to make this process faster however o heard many good things about two other options; k6 and j-ultra. 
Which one would you recommend? How long does it take to grind 18gr medium roast coffee on manual grinders? Also do you recommend to buy one electric grinder AND one manual grinder?
Thanks!

I downloaded the apps, made the spreadsheets, even tried the envelope method. None of it stuck for more than a month.

What finally worked was treating it like a game instead of a chore.

I set up little challenges for myself. Like, I’d try to go three days without spending anything or see how much I could put on one card just from car-related stuff in a week. That included things like gas, insurance, and even a parking meter app.

Then I’d reward myself by using the points I earned for something small and satisfying, like a free coffee or a movie night at home. It felt more like I was working toward something than just cutting back.

Anyone else had success shifting their mindset like myself?  Would love to hear how others are making their finances feel less like homework.

TLDR: Budgeting didn’t click until I started treating it like a game. Challenges + rewards = consistency.",3,1750370354.0,personalfinance,4,1.0,False
1lfnah7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bergen/comments/1lfnah7/trying_to_decide_on_a_fjord_trip_from_bergen/,Trying to decide on a fjord trip from Bergen,"Hi all, 

I'm looking at taking a trip to Bergen in July, and am trying to decide on a choice of 3 different fjord trips I'm trying to decide between! They all have different things I like the sound of and there doesn't seem to be a combination of all of them...  
  
For the first one - I love the sound of the fjord safari since it's a smaller more intimate boat, and possibly a better chance of seeing wildlife? But this one doesn't include a visit to Stegastein, which looks amazing and I've heard great things about, or a trip to Tvindefossen which also looks gorgeous

The second and third ones both include trips to Stegastein and Tvindefossen, but just a regular fjord cruise.  
  
Does anyone have any feedback on which might be the best option? Are fjord safaris worth it compared to a regular fjord cruise? Are Tvidefossen and Stegastein worth visiting?

I started on 25mg and it seemed like an ok dosage, I did notice I would easily tire after one errand and needed a break. I booted up to 50mg after 3ish weeks and for several days I felt fatigue, like walking through mud fatigue, emotionally blunted, and dizziness. I ended up quitting it entirely.

Two weeks later, I am starting to see that Lamictal was doing more work than I thought.

1lfn86u,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash_drivers/comments/1lfn86u/hanging_up_the_car_keys_for_the_summer/,Hanging up the car keys for the summer,"I started doing DoorDash deliveries in late February, and as of today, June 19th, 2025... I’ve got to admit, it just isn’t as fun or rewarding as it used to be.

Since June began, it now takes over 45 minutes just to get one order. I’ve done full 8-hour dashes (with a 30-minute break) during all the supposed peak hours — I’ve tested it all:

9am–11am: coffee runs & breakfast

12pm–1:30pm: lunch

5:30pm–11pm: dinner


Despite that, the average earnings right now are between $40–$65 per 8-hour dash. That’s straight-up disappointing. I gave the market ample time (about a week and a half) to pick up but it was to no avail. 

Before June hit, those same 8-hour shifts could net me around $200. For drivers going all in — 12 to even 24-hour dashes — you were looking at up to $625. It felt like hustle actually paid off.

Now, with summer kicking off, there’s a huge influx of new drivers. Some are just curious, others just want something to do for the summer. I get it — but the result is oversaturation. And it’s obvious the app is prioritizing high-paying orders for new drivers to “hook” them in, which ends up burying the veterans who've been grinding consistently.

Look, I’ll be real — I’m not some elite Dasher. My background is in kitchens — flipping burgers, prepping food, and serving the public the kind of dishes that make your taste buds explode. I already have a full-time job. I picked up DD to earn some side cash for a trip my wife and I took to Scottsdale to see Medieval Times.

(And yeah, we even dashed there for half a day — nonstop orders, and we got to sightsee between drops. It was fun.)

But coming back home — 800 miles north — orders are almost non-existent in our market. The app says “we’re busy,” but once you start the dash, you’ll wait 45 minutes for a $2 no-tip offer. It’s discouraging.

So, just for the summer, I’m hanging up the keys and the bag. I’ll be back when the kids go back to school and the state fair rolls into town. Until then, I’ll still be checking in here on the sub — I’ve always enjoyed seeing everyone’s accomplishments, rants, advice, and wild delivery stories.

To all the dashers out there:
Keep moving forward. Don’t accept lowball offers. Don’t take verbal or physical abuse from anyone. Drive safe — it’s getting rough out there.

Catch you on the flip side.

He believes all the things I've stated I've made up in my head due to my anxiety.","I'm extremely worried about certain red flags I have with my partner which I need advice from Reddit.

The minute I met him it is weird, my gut told me something is not right. I want to highlight all the red flags I am about to show and if anyone can give me advice, I'd appreciate it hugely. In addition, when I've brought these up, he's stated the reason I am so worried about the relationship and unsure is because ""I'm mentally unwell.""

On the second time meeting him, he took me to a ring shop to get my ring size which I found very unusual and it made me very uncomfortable.

The first date he was already suggesting we must date and got upset when I mentioned about me being single as I didn't know him yet and we just started to know eachother on this first day.

When I talk to his friends, more than him, he got jealous. I remember sitting for lunch talking to his friend and he was upset that I didn't ask him more questions or speak to him more.

He stated girls cannot be friends with guys and every guy friend I've had, he's questioned, believes I'm seeing them, doesn't like them, doesn't get why I'd get a coffee with them or talk at work.

Commented on what I have worn. Asked if I'm wearing a skirt to show off to someone as it isn't for him or why I'm going with particular gym gear as it shows skin.

Got upset if we didn't call every night despite telling him some nights I want to be alone and have me time. I feel he got upset even when I spent time with family...

I went travelling which he was very against and upset about. Believed I'd go meet someone. The 3 days I didn't have signal, he goes to a bar, gets very drunk and flirts with girls and gets their Instagrams.

Called me mean names, called me evil etc when I have expressed I want to split from him or I've told him he's impacting my mental health.

I started on elvanse, the effects were good but short lived and only really helped for a couple of hours, so I was switched to Concerta. 

I was between doses and decided to go down from 72mg to 54mg a few weeks ago as I had had (increased) trouble sleeping and sometimes felt the same feeling as when you have a little too much coffee.

I’ve had a lot going on in life recently. The last few months (at least) I’ve had quite bad anxiety and sometimes my feelings have been quite intense (frustration/anger, sadness/upset etc) which has caused a lot of stress for me and my partner. I’d put these experiences down to being relative to what’s going on but upon reflection, I’m questioning whether the medication has contributed to this somewhat.

I often have the thought of what life would be like without the medication. It’s strange, but it’s hard to remember the difficulties I had that led me to taking the medication in the first place.

Has anyone had the experience of being on adhd medication for a while and then, for whatever reason, changed to a significantly lower dose or no meds? What was that like for you and would you recommend trying it?

I’m on state funded medication and it’s quite difficult to get, so my concern is if I get out of the system, it’s going to be difficult to get back in again - I therefore want to be considered in my approach.

I
wiped the cloud repository, scrubbed the backups from my local drives, and then physically
destroyed the hard drives with a drill press in my garage. The noise the drill made, that
high-pitched scream as it bit into the magnetic platters, is one of the few sounds that can drown
out the ringing in my ears. I am writing this now, under a name that isn't mine, from a city I've
never lived in before, because last night I saw an article about a new augmented reality game
that's about to launch. The description of its ""dynamic environmental interaction engine""
sounded terrifyingly familiar. It made me realize my silence is a luxury I can't afford. My silence
could get someone else killed.

I live in a small, furnished apartment now. The kind that's designed for transient people. The
furniture is bland and impersonal, which is how I like it. There are no pictures on the walls, no
sentimental clutter. Everything I own fits into two suitcases. I have rituals. I check the three
deadbolts on my door every hour. I never sit in a chair that has its back to a doorway. I've
covered the reflective screen of the television with a thick blanket. I sleep with a salt lamp on,
not because I believe it does anything, but because its dim, orange glow means I never have to
wake up in complete darkness. The silence of this place is the hardest part. It's a deep,
profound quiet that my brain constantly tries to fill. Every creak of the floorboards, every groan
of the plumbing in the walls, becomes a question. Is that just the building settling? Or is it
something else?

Aura was supposed to be my answer to all that. My way out. It was supposed to be a
ghost-hunting app, but that was just the marketing angle. The concept itself isn't original, I know.
The app store is flooded with them, cheap toys that flash random numbers and play spooky
sounds. Mine was just going to be better. More elegant. I wasn't a believer; I was a programmer,
and a damn good one. And to a programmer, the universe is a system with rules. I saw the
paranormal not as a spiritual phenomenon, but as a predictable glitch in human perception. The
eye seeing faces in wood grain, the ear hearing whispers in static. This is called pareidolia, and
I believed I could code an engine that would replicate those patterns on demand.
The goal was to create the most convincing illusion of the supernatural ever coded. The app
would use a phone's camera and microphone, but the data it collected was mostly a
smokescreen. The real work was done by my algorithm. It would analyze the visual input for any
random noise, pixel artifacts, lens flare, dust motes, and subtly enhance them into faint,
smoky shapes that looked vaguely like figures. The audio component did the same, stringing
together snippets of white noise to create the impression of voices. It was a fake. A clever one,
but a fake. My masterpiece of deception.

My best friend, Mark, was my only beta tester. He was my opposite in almost every way. I saw
the world as a complex machine to be understood; he saw it as a magical story to be
experienced. We'd been friends since our freshman year of college, bonded by a shared love for
late-night sci-fi movies and cheap pizza. I remember one night, we were walking back to our
dorm through a misty field on campus, and Mark stopped dead. He pointed at a gnarled old oak
tree. ""Doesn't it look like it's watching us?"" he'd whispered, his voice filled with genuine awe. I'd
laughed and pulled out my phone, taking a picture and explaining the precise way the shadows
and the fog were creating the illusion of a face in the bark. He just shook his head, smiling. ""You
see the code, Leo,"" he said. ""I see the ghost in the machine."" I think, in a way, I was building
Aura for him. I was trying to prove my point, to show him the code behind the ghost, but maybe I
was also trying to give him the magic he so desperately wanted to see.

He was my biggest supporter. He didn't see a cynical cash grab; he saw a genuine tool for
discovery. He was the one who pushed me, texting me links to local ""haunted"" places and
begging me to try the app there. One of his favorites was the old Blackwood Mill on the edge of
town, a derelict textile factory that had been rotting since the fifties. ""The EMF fluctuations there
would be off the charts!"" he'd text. I always patiently explained that the increased background
noise in an old, drafty building would just give the algorithm more random data to work with,
creating better fakes. It was a feature, not a bug.

For the first few weeks of the beta test, it was fun. It was our game. He'd send me screenshots
of wispy figures in the corner of his room. ""I think I have a ghost in my kitchen,"" he texted one
afternoon, along with a picture showing a vague, smoky smudge hovering near his toaster.
""Does it want toast?"" I replied. He sent back a laughing emoji. ""I think it's a gluten-free ghost. It
just seems to be vibing."" I felt a swell of pride in my work. My code was working perfectly. It was
a perfect trick.

The turning point was the mill. He finally went, against my advice. He called me that night, and
the usual excitement in his voice was replaced by something else. Something tight and strained.
""Leo, I saw something,"" he said, his voice low. ""At the mill. It was different.""

I settled into my chair, ready to be the voice of reason. ""Different how?""

""It wasn't like the others,"" he said. ""The ones in my apartment are like... smoke. They drift. This
one... it was solid. It was in one of the collapsed doorways in the main weaving room. It was just
a shape, you know? A tall, black shape. But it didn't move. It just stood there. And when I
pointed my phone at it, it didn't fade. It... it stepped back. Into the shadows.""

A prickle of unease ran down my spine, but I squashed it. ""Mark, the lighting in that place must
be a nightmare. The sensors were probably getting confused, creating a hard-edged artifact
instead of a soft one. And the 'stepping back' thing was probably just the filter re-evaluating the
light as you moved.""

He was quiet for a moment. ""No,"" he said, his voice small, a raw edge to it. ""It felt like it was watching me, Leo. It felt... wrong. It's one thing for your algorithm to show me smoke, but this felt different, solid. Like it knew I was looking."" I spent the next ten minutes patiently explaining the technical reasons for what he saw. I was so sure of myself, so condescendingly logical. I can still hear the resignation in his voice when he finally gave up. ""I guess so. Still, I can't shake it. This one felt different."" That conversation haunts me now. It was his last chance, his cry for help, and I explained it away with algorithms.

A few days later, I pushed the final update to the audio feature. I'd tweaked it to sound more
""natural."" That night, my phone rang. It was 2:17 AM. I remember the exact time because my
eyes were burning from staring at lines of code and I was about to finally give up for the night. I
almost didn't answer. I wish to God I hadn't.
There was no ""hello."" Just Mark's shaky breathing and the low, crackling hum of the app. I could
picture him perfectly, sitting up in the dark, phone in hand, completely immersed in the illusion
I'd built for him.

""Leo,"" he whispered, his voice tight with a fear so profound it sounded like he was being
strangled. ""It's here. The thing from the mill is in my apartment.""

Before I could answer, a different sound came through the phone's speaker, cutting through the
static I had created. It was a voice, but it wasn't the garbled output from my audio engine. This
was clear, slow, and raspy, like something was dragging the sound out of a long-dead throat.
It said his name.

""Mark... Mark....Marrrk....""

The call dropped. In the silence that followed, I felt a cold dread wash over me. A programmer's
dread. The kind you get when your code does something it wasn't designed to do. Something
impossible. I had created a filter to fake the paranormal, and something from the other side had
just used it to speak.

My first reaction was purely technical. My mind raced through the possibilities, desperately
trying to find a logical explanation. Did the audio buffer pull a cached sound bite from another
app? Was there a memory leak causing it to access and distort a random audio file on his
phone? Could it be a prank? Was Mark playing a soundboard to mess with me? That last one
felt the most likely. It had to be. He was just getting me back for all the times I'd been a cynical
ass about his beliefs.

I texted him, ""very funny. You got me.""
No reply. The little text bubble with the three dots didn't even appear.

I texted again. ""Seriously, call me back. That was a good one.""

The empty space below my message was deafening. I called his phone. It went straight to
voicemail. That's when the programmer's dread was replaced by a more primal, human fear.
The kind that starts as a cold knot in your stomach and quickly spreads, leaving ice in its wake.
I grabbed my keys and was out the door in thirty seconds. The drive to Mark's apartment
complex usually took fifteen minutes. I think I made it in eight. Every red light was an
accusation. Every empty street corner felt like a judgment. The streetlights smeared past my
windshield like watercolor streaks. My mind was a frantic battleground between logic and terror.
Logic insisted it was a prank. An elaborate, cruel joke. But terror whispered about the sound of
that voice. The way it had stretched his name out, like it was tasting it. It wasn't a soundbite. It
sounded ancient.

I pulled into the parking lot of his building, killing the engine. The silence was heavy. His
apartment was on the third floor, corner unit. The lights were off. Of course they were off, it was
almost 2:30 in the morning. Still, it felt wrong, like the darkness in those windows was deeper
than it should be.

I took the stairs two at a time, my heart hammering against my ribs. I stood outside his door,
number 314, and listened. Nothing. I knocked, first gently, then harder.

""Mark! It's me, Leo! Open up!""

Silence.

""Come on, man, this isn't funny anymore!""

The knot in my stomach tightened. I tried the doorknob. Locked. I always carried a small
lockpick set on my keychain,a holdover from my teenage years of thinking I was a cool hacker.
It felt absurd to be using it now. My hands were shaking so badly it took me almost a minute, the
clicks and scrapes of the metal amplified in the silent hallway. I kept expecting to hear him on
the other side, laughing at me. The lock finally clicked, loud as a gunshot.

I pushed the door open. ""Mark?""

The apartment was still and dark. The air was cold and stale. I could see the familiar shapes of
his lumpy couch, his cluttered coffee table, the towering shelves of books and graphic novels.
On the coffee table was a plate with a half-eaten sandwich. Everything was in its place, but it felt
like a museum exhibit. A diorama of a life that had suddenly stopped.

""Mark, are you in your room?"" I called out, my voice sounding thin and weak.

I moved through the living room, my feet silent on the carpet. The door to his bedroom was
slightly ajar. I pushed it open.

And that's when I found him.

He was lying on his back in bed, his eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling with an expression of
profound, frozen shock. His phone was on the floor beside the bed, face up. The screen was
still on, lit by the eerie glow of my app's interface.
I think I stopped breathing. For a moment, the world dissolved into a silent, slow-motion
vignette. I saw the rumpled sheets, the way his hand was curled on the floor just inches from the
phone, the faint, almost imperceptible tremor in my own hands.

Then my lungs remembered their job and I sucked in a ragged breath. I stumbled forward, my
knees hitting the floor beside his bed. ""Mark,"" I whispered, touching his arm. He was cold. Not
just cool, but a deep, penetrating cold that felt wrong. Unnatural.

My gaze fell to the phone. Aura's interface was running, the familiar swirling blue and purple
background pulsing gently. But in the center of the screen, where the spectral shapes were
supposed to appear, was an image. It wasn't one of my fake, smoky wisps. This was sharp,
detailed, and utterly terrifying.

It was a face. Gaunt and narrow, with deep-set, empty sockets where eyes should have been.
The skin was tight over the cheekbones, like dried parchment. The mouth was a thin, lipless
slash, twisted into a silent snarl of utter malice. It was rendered in perfect, high-definition clarity
against the backdrop of Mark's own bedroom ceiling, as if the app was looking back at him from
the other side. It was a predator's face. And it was looking right at the camera. At me.

I scrambled back, knocking over a glass of water on his nightstand. The sound shattered the
silence, and reality came crashing back in. I fumbled for my own phone, my fingers thick and
clumsy, and dialed 911. The dispatcher's calm, professional voice was an anchor in a swirling
sea of horror. I choked out Mark's address, babbling something about my friend not breathing.
The paramedics arrived first, then the police. Two officers, a man and a woman, separated me
from the paramedics and started asking questions. I told them the truth, or a version of it. I was
his friend. He called me, sounded strange. I came over to check on him. I found him like this.
The male officer, whose name was Miller, picked up Mark's phone. He looked at the screen, his
brow furrowed.

""What is this?"" he asked, showing it to me. The face was still there, frozen on the screen.

""It's an app,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""A game. A ghost-hunting thing. He was testing it for me.""
Miller grunted, a sound of mild disapproval. He showed it to his partner. She squinted at it.
""Creepy,"" she said, and handed it back. He tapped the screen, but the image was frozen. He
had to hard-reboot the phone to get it to turn off. When it came back on, the image was gone.
Just a normal lock screen with a picture of a nebula. They saw a creepy picture from a game. I
saw a photograph of a murderer.

The official cause of death came the next day. A massive, spontaneous stroke. Sudden Adult
Death Syndrome. They said the look on his face was common in such cases, the result of the
brain's final, catastrophic misfire. The call to his parents was the hardest thing I've ever done. I
listened to his mother's sobs, telling her what the doctors had said, the lies feeling like poison on
my tongue. How do you tell a mother that her son is dead because you accidentally coded a
doorway to hell?

I went home from the police station and locked the door. I didn't turn on any lights. I just sat on
my couch in the dark, the silence of my own apartment feeling loud and threatening. Every
creak of the floorboards, every groan of the building settling, every distant siren was a potential
threat. My carefully constructed world, built on logic and code, had been shattered. I had
opened a door, and I had no idea how to close it.
The first week was a haze of grief and guilt. I didn't touch my computers. The thought of looking
at Aura's code made me physically ill. I was done. The project was over. I wanted to believe that
if I just walked away, it would all stop.

But then the subtle things started happening.
It began subtly. I'd find the pantry door, the one I'd explicitly checked before leaving, nudged open by an inch, its shadow stretching too long across the linoleum. My keys, meticulously hung on the hook by the door, would mysteriously reappear on the coffee table, resting precisely where I'd left them only moments before, yet inexplicably moved. I blamed it on grief, on exhaustion. My mind was playing tricks on me, I told myself.

Then came the cold spots. One evening, an intense, localized chill descended, sharp as a winter breath. It wasn't just a temperature drop; the air itself felt heavy, thick with a metallic tang, and my breath plumed visibly before my face. I gasped, goosebumps erupting across my skin. It felt like standing in front of an open freezer door. I got up, but the frigid pocket followed, clinging to me like a shroud. I walked into the kitchen, and the patch of freezing air moved with me, a pocket of winter in my heated apartment. I even grabbed a digital thermometer. The air in the kitchen was 72 degrees. The air in the cold spot was 45. Then, as abruptly as it arrived, the air warmed, leaving only the ghost of an icicle down my spine.
The shadows were harder to explain. From the corner of my eye, a flicker of movement, a tall, dark shape, would dart past the doorway to the hall. My head would snap around, but there was always nothing there. It left behind only a chilling residue, a sense of something having been there, something that vanished the moment I tried to focus.

The breaking point came about three weeks after Mark's death. I was in the shower, the one
place I felt I could let my guard down. The hot water and steam were a temporary shield against
the creeping dread. I was rinsing the shampoo from my hair when I heard it.

A whisper.

It was faint, almost lost in the hiss of the water, but it was unmistakable. It was that same dry,
scraping voice from the phone call. And it said my name.

""Leo...""

I froze, shampoo suds dripping into my eyes. The water suddenly felt icy cold. My heart
hammered against my ribs. I shut off the faucet, plunging the bathroom into a near-silent state,
the only sound the frantic thumping in my chest and the slow drip-drip-drip from the
showerhead.

""Who's there?"" I called out, my voice a pathetic croak.
Silence.

I stood there for what felt like an eternity, naked and vulnerable, straining my ears. Nothing. Had
I imagined it? Was I finally losing my mind?
No. I knew what I had heard.

It was in my apartment. It had followed me from Mark's. Or worse, it hadn't followed me. It had
just changed its focus. The app was the window. Mark had looked through it, and it had taken
him. Now it was my turn. I was the one who had built the window.

I stumbled out of the shower, grabbing a towel. My mind was racing. I couldn't live like this,
haunted by shadows and whispers, waiting for the final, terrifying confrontation. I had to know. I
had to see it. I had to understand what I was up against.

There was only one way to do that.
My hands were shaking as I walked to my desk and picked up my phone. I hadn't looked at the
app since that night. My thumb hovered over the icon for Aura, a stylized, swirling letter 'A'. Part
of me was screaming not to do it, to just run, to leave everything behind. But another, more
desperate part needed to see. I had to turn the lie I had created into a tool for truth.
I tapped the icon.

The app loaded, the familiar purple and blue interface filling the screen. It looked so innocent.
So harmless. I took a deep breath and stood up, holding the phone like a shield. I activated the
main filter.

I panned the phone across my living room. For a few seconds, nothing happened. The screen
just showed my apartment, tinted with the app's signature ethereal glow. Then, the algorithm
started doing its job. A few fake wisps of smoke appeared near a bookshelf, faded, and then
disappeared. I almost let out a sigh of relief. It was just a stupid app. It was all in my head.
Then I pointed the phone towards the darkest corner of the room, near the hallway entrance
where I'd seen the shadows move.
The phone's screen flickered violently. The gentle, swirling colors of the interface glitched,
dissolving into a mess of green and black pixels for a second, like the app was struggling to
process what it was seeing. My phone grew hot in my hand.

Then the image resolved.

It wasn't a wisp. It wasn't a smoky, vague shape. Standing in the corner of my room was a
figure. It was tall and unnaturally thin, a stark, black silhouette that seemed to absorb the light
around it, making the shadows in the corner look pale by comparison. It was featureless, a void
in the shape of a man, but it had presence. It had weight.

As I watched, frozen in place, it slowly turned its head to look at me. There was no face, no
eyes, but I felt its gaze lock onto me through the phone. A wave of pure, undiluted malevolence
washed over me, a psychic pressure that made my teeth ache and my vision swim.
Then, the audio feed crackled to life. It wasn't the pre-programmed static. It was a low, guttural
growl that vibrated through the phone, a sound of pure hate.

I had built a window. And now, the thing on the other side was looking back.

I didn't scream. I couldn't. The sound was trapped in my throat, choked off by a terror so
profound it felt like a physical weight on my chest. I lowered the phone, my arm trembling
uncontrollably. I looked at the corner with my own eyes. Nothing. Just shadows. But I knew it
was there. I could feel it. The air was thick with its presence, heavy and cold.

I raised the phone again. The black figure was still there, motionless, watching me. I took a
stumbling step back, and its head tilted, a gesture of cold curiosity. The low growl from the
phone's speaker deepened, and underneath it, a voice began to coalesce from the static.

""Leo... the architect...""

The voice was the same dry rasp I'd heard before, but clearer now, stronger. It was using my
app as a megaphone, focusing its energy through the very code I had written.

I dropped the phone. It clattered to the floor, the screen showing the ceiling. I scrambled away,
crab-walking backward until my back hit the opposite wall, my eyes locked on the empty corner.
I could hear the voice still coming from the phone's speaker, a distorted, mocking whisper.
""...opened... the door...""

I spent the rest of the night huddled on my couch, wrapped in a blanket, with every light in the
apartment blazing. Sleep was impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that featureless
black silhouette, that void in the shape of a man. The entity, my entity, was here. It was real. And
it knew my name.

The next day, I became an investigator in my own horror story. Fueled by a desperate, terrified
energy, I turned to the only thing I knew: the code. If I had created the problem, then somewhere
in the millions of lines of code, there had to be a solution. There had to be an ""off"" switch.
I sat at my computer, forcing myself to open the Aura project files. Looking at the familiar
interface of my coding environment felt profane. This workspace, which had once been my
sanctuary, now felt like a crime scene. I pulled up the core files for the pareidolia filter and the
audio engine.

I had been so proud of its design. It was supposed to work by taking random input and forcing a
pattern onto it. But what if it wasn't forcing a pattern? What if it was detecting one? What if the
""random"" energy fluctuations it was reading weren't random at all?

I dove into the audio-processing module first, since that was the source of the voice. I had built
a sophisticated noise generator that was seeded by the microphone's raw input. It was meant to
capture ambient sound, strip out recognizable frequencies, and use the remaining ""junk"" data to
create its EVP effect. My terrifying hypothesis was that the entity was somehow embedding its
voice into that junk data.

For hours, I analyzed the code, running simulations, checking data flows. And then I found it. A
single, elegant, and catastrophic flaw. In my attempt to create a more ""natural-sounding"" static, I
had created a recursive feedback loop. The app wasn't just listening to ambient noise; it was
listening to the static it was producing, processing it, and then feeding it back into the system. It
was a closed loop, designed to refine the randomness. Instead, it had turned my app into a kind
of sonic focusing lens. It was amplifying a frequency I couldn't hear, a carrier wave in the noise,
making it stronger and stronger until it became a bridge. The entity wasn't just speaking into the
microphone; it was using the feedback loop to power its own manifestation, to pull itself into our
world.

The realization hit me like a physical blow. I hadn't built a fake ghost detector. I had built a real
ghost amplifier.

A sudden, sharp CRACK from the kitchen made me jump out of my chair. My heart leaped into
my throat. I crept out of my office, my every nerve screaming. On the kitchen floor, in a thousand
pieces, was a ceramic mug that had been sitting on the counter, a good two feet from the edge.
""Clever boy,"" the voice whispered. This time, it wasn't from the phone. It was in the room with
me, a faint, sibilant hiss that seemed to come from everywhere at once. ""You understand the logic, Leo. Now feel the consequence.""

I ran back to my desk, my hands shaking. The haunting was escalating. The subtle events were
giving way to overt, physical displays. It was getting stronger. And my app was its battery pack.
Over the next few days, my life became a living hell. The entity grew bolder. It was a constant,
oppressive presence. I would be working, and a book would fly off a shelf behind me. The lights
would flicker and die, plunging me into darkness, only to flare back on moments later. The
whispers were no longer just whispers; they were taunts.

I used the app sparingly, only when I absolutely had to know where it was. Each time, the image
of the black silhouette became slightly more defined. I started to see hints of a shape within the
void, something emaciated and twisted. The growls and whispers from the audio feed grew in
clarity.

""Mark... screamed for you,"" it hissed at me one night, the voice coming from my phone's
speaker as I watched the silhouette stand motionless by my bedroom door. ""He knew you left
him.""

""Shut up,"" I whispered back to the empty room, tears of rage and terror streaming down my
face.

""You built the door,"" it continued, its voice a venomous caress. ""Now you must pay the toll. All
who build the doors must pay.""

It was feeding on me. On my fear, my guilt, my focus. The more I interacted with it, the more I
researched the code, the more I thought about it, the stronger it became. My attempt to
understand my prison was only reinforcing the bars.
I tried to find answers outside of my own code. I spent sleepless nights trawling the darkest
corners of the internet,paranormal forums, occult wikis, digitized versions of crumbling old
grimoires. I learned about resonant frequencies, about entities drawn to focused human will,
about the idea of digital sigils. The consensus, from madmen and scholars alike, was terrifyingly
consistent: to create a connection, you need a symbol and you need energy. I had created a
digital symbol,the app itself,and a machine that generated its own energy. I had, in my blind
arrogance, stumbled upon the recipe for summoning a demon and had written it in Python.
I even found a ghost of a story on an obscure developer forum from six years prior. A user with
a now-deleted account posted a frantic message about an ""unintended audio feedback
phenomenon"" in an AR project he was working on. He described hearing voices in the static,
voices that knew his name. The few replies dismissed him as a crank or a troll. Three days after
his initial post, his account went silent. He never logged in again. Reading it felt like finding my
own tombstone, already carved.

The entity started using Mark against me. One afternoon, I heard the faint sound of music
coming from my living room. It was a deep cut from an obscure indie band that Mark and I had
seen live years ago. Our song, we used to joke. It was coming from my speakers, which were
unplugged. The taunts became more specific, laced with details of my past that only Mark could
have known. It was proof that it hadn't just killed him; it had violated him, perhaps even absorbed fragments of his being. It had his memories.
The breaking point, the moment I knew I had to act, came on a Tuesday night. I had been
awake for nearly forty-eight hours, staring at code, trying to find a way to reverse the feedback
loop. I must have drifted off at my desk. I was jolted awake by the sound of my bedroom door
slamming shut with enough force to shake the wall.
I grabbed my phone and activated Aura. I pointed it down the hall. The black figure wasn't
standing in the corner anymore. It was moving. It was slowly, deliberately gliding down the
hallway, directly towards my office. And it wasn't just a silhouette. The filter was now resolving a
horrifying form within the blackness. Long, spindly limbs that moved with a jerky, unnatural gait.
A skeletal frame draped in what looked like rags of shadow. And the face,the face from Mark's
phone,was now visible, a snarling mask of ancient evil.


The audio wasn't a whisper anymore. It was a clear, cold, conversational voice.

""Time is up, Leo. I'm tired of the waiting room.""

I could hear it with my own ears now, a faint echo of the voice from the phone. The barrier was
breaking down. Soon I wouldn't need the app to see it or hear it. It was manifesting.

That was it. I couldn't fight it. I couldn't contain it. My only option was to destroy the connection.
To burn the bridge.

The entity was at the doorway to my office now. Through the phone, it was a towering, horrifying
monster. With my own eyes, it was a shimmering distortion in the air, a place where the light
seemed to bend and warp around a point of absolute cold. A glass on my desk rattled, then slid
to the edge and shattered on the floor.

My mind raced, formulating a desperate plan. The code, the app, the servers,they were the
anchor. The digital footprint was the doorway. I had to erase every last trace of it.

I sat down at my keyboard, my fingers flying. The entity was in the room with me now. The cold
was intense, biting. My breath plumed in front of my face. Through the phone, which I had
propped up on the desk, I could see it looming over me, its featureless face inches from mine.
""You built this cage, architect. You are bound to it,"" it hissed, the sound both in my ears and in my head.
A wave of pressure slammed into me. The air grew thick, like I was moving through water. My
vision swam. The entity on the screen let out a shriek, a sound of digital feedback and tearing
metal.

I started with the remote repository, the master source of the code stored in the cloud. I opened my terminal, fingers flying, and typed git push --delete origin master. The command, to erase the primary branch, executed.

A wave of pressure slammed into me. The air grew thick, like I was moving through water. My
vision swam. The entity on the screen let out a shriek, a sound of digital feedback and tearing
metal.

Next, the backups. I had them stored on a separate cloud server. I logged in, my fingers
fumbling on the keys. The lights in my office flickered violently. My monitor buzzed, the text
blurring.

""THE DOOR..."" the entity roared, the voice seeming to shake the very foundations of the
building.

I felt an icy, crushing grip on my shoulder. It was real. Not just a feeling of cold, but the distinct,
sharp pressure of phantom fingers digging into my muscle. I cried out in pain, arching my back,
but I didn't stop typing. I navigated to the directory and initiated the delete command. rm -rf /aura_backups.

The grip vanished, but the cold intensified. The monitor went black.

""NO!""

I didn't panic. I knew the keyboard shortcuts by heart. I kept typing blind, confirming the deletion.
I hit Enter. The monitor flickered back on, showing a confirmation message. The backup files
were gone.

Only my local files remained. Two drives. A primary solid-state drive and a secondary hard drive
for storage. I opened the file explorer. The entity was raging now. The distortion in the air was
churning, violent. The papers on my desk swirled into the air as if caught in a whirlwind. A
framed picture of me and Mark flew off the wall and shattered against the door.

""YOU CANNOT CLOSE WHAT YOU HAVE OPENED!""
I selected the Aura project folder on my main drive. My hand hovered over the delete key. I
could feel its focus on me, a pressure on my mind that was trying to break my will. I saw an
image of Mark's face in my mind, his eyes wide with terror.

I slammed the delete key. Are you sure you want to permanently delete these files?

""YES!!""

A piercing shriek filled the room, a sound of pure agony that was both physical and psychic. It
threw me back from my desk, my chair skidding across the floor. On my phone, the entity's form
was dissolving, unraveling like a corrupted video file, its pixels shredding into nothingness.

I crawled back to the desk, ignoring the pain in my head. One drive left. The secondary storage.
I selected the final directory. My final sin.
Just as my finger touched the key, I felt it. Icy, unseen hands closing around my throat. The
pressure was immense, cutting off my air. My lungs burned. Black spots danced in my vision.
This was it. This was how it ended. Just like Mark.
With the last of my strength, my vision tunneling to a single point, I lunged forward and hit the
Enter key with the palm of my hand.

The pressure vanished.

The screaming stopped.

The whirlwind in the room died.

The distortion in the air dissipated.

The figure on my phone screen dissolved into a final shower of static, and then the app crashed,
returning the screen to my normal home page.
Everything was silent. Utterly, completely silent. I lay on the floor, gasping for air, my throat raw.
The cold in the room slowly receded, replaced by the normal, ambient temperature. I sat up, my
body trembling with adrenaline and exhaustion.
It was over. I had done it. I had closed the door.
For a long time, I just sat there on the floor of my ruined office, surrounded by broken glass and
scattered papers, and I cried. I cried for Mark. I cried out of sheer, gut-wrenching terror. And I
cried with a sliver of relief so profound it was painful.
Eventually, I got up. I packed a bag. I walked out of my apartment without looking back. The
next day, I went to my garage, took the hard drives from my computer, and drilled holes through
them until they were nothing but shattered platters and ruined electronics. I drove for two days,
putting as much distance between me and that place as I could.

Which brings me to now. Three months later. I live in a small, anonymous apartment in a city
where no one knows my name. The whispers are gone. The shadows are gone. The cold spots
are gone. The entity I gave form to is gone, its anchor to this world destroyed.

But I am not free.

I have a new fear now. A quieter, more insidious one. Before, when the haunting was at its
peak, I had the app. I had my terrible lens. I could turn it on and see my tormentor. I knew where
it was. I could see the monster in the corner, the demon in the hallway. I could face my enemy.
Now, I am blind.

I sit in the dark of my new apartment, and the silence is the loudest thing I've ever heard. Every
creak of the floorboards in the apartment above, every gust of wind against the windowpane,
every unfamiliar groan of a new building settling sends a jolt of pure ice through my veins. Last
week, a floorboard in my own hallway creaked when I was sitting perfectly still in the living room.
I spent the next six hours sitting on a kitchen stool with my back against the wall, watching the
hallway, until the sun came up. It was probably just the building's old wood contracting.
Probably.

I destroyed the door I built. I have to believe that. But what if it didn't need the door anymore?
What if all my app did was teach it how to notice us? What if it's just weaker now, biding its
time?

I have no way of knowing. I have no way of checking. I have removed my only sense that could
perceive the world I now know for a fact is real. The terror of seeing the monster is nothing
compared to the terror of knowing it's there, and not being able to see it at all. It could be
standing in the corner of this room right now, watching me type these words, a silent, gaunt
spectator to my confession. And it could be smiling, remembering the taste of my friend's fear.
I don't know. And I will never know again. That is my true haunting.

So please. If you are a programmer, a creator, a dreamer, and you have an idea like the one I
had,leave it alone. Don't build the door. Don't even draw the blueprints. Some things in the
dark are meant to stay there, unseen. Because once you see them, they see you too. And even
if you manage to close your eyes, you'll never be able to forget that they're still there, watching.",3,1750369627.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

But he looked like he was smothering and struggling to breathe. 

It was the worst sound I’ve ever heard for hours and hours and hours. I prayed and begged god to let the suffering end. And I feel so guilty for wishing his life away. 

He was gasping and taking shallow breaths and gurgling and making so much noise in his lungs and then all of a sudden he died. 

He was on oxygen 24/7 and couldn’t breathe without it. I think his lungs just gave out. 

I feel like he drowned and smothered and suffered.

I don’t think the noise was just a death rattle. This was a loud noise of mucus like when you wheeze with pneomonia in his lungs. You could feel his lungs and feel the mucus rattling. It sounded like a super loud coffee pot perking.

He laid and breathed like that for hours. It sounded like he had to be in pure hell.

I will never get over this. 

Does the rattling and struggle to breathe mean he suffered?

He was on hydromorphine,, Ativan and haldol but I worry the dosage wasn’t high enough to make him unconscious. 

Has anyone ever experienced something similar and knows what happened and how he died?",1,1750369348.0,COPD,2,1.0,False
1lfmwo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/paralegal/comments/1lfmwo3/dont_believe_in_breaks/,Don't believe in breaks,My lawyers don't believe we deserve breaks. As I live 15 minutes out of town I usually just sit at my desk for lunch and play games on my phone or whatever. Same goes for the half hour coffee break at 3 pm in the afternoon we get. Every single flipping time one of the lawyers will come up to my desk and ask me to do something. Like cannot you not see I'M HAVING LUNCH AND I'M ENTITLED TO A FULL LUNCH BREAK! IT IS SO URGENT IT CAN'T WAIT FOR AN HOUR? Like it's almost every effing day. Not to mention we haven't had a raise in 5 years and 5 years ago it was 50 cents. No shitting you. I'm seriously considering changing careers because these lawyers just don't give a 💩 about their staff. Rant over.,10,1750369306.0,paralegal,11,1.0,False

Thanks to all the support of local Reddit people and exposure on Instagram. We were able to secure a space for our barista classes that have a permanent location. 

Our new schedule is out will be able to offer a higher quality of training and more days during the week. We even offer payment plans for those in a tight budget that still want to better their skills.

Completely, I don't think my body produces eumelanin at all, just pheomelanin. That means I am orange, pink, and translucent. My hair looks kinda like roadside kill of an orange and blond so dirty it's called filthy, skin is pink/red, and my lashes and brows are just not there. BUT I have central heterochromia and my eyes have brown in them, just a little in the center.

Also, my little brother was born dark. He was brown haired, brown eyed, tans like a coffee bean etc. But he also has alopecia and no hair now. And it's been years since I last saw him and to my surprise he now also has same eyes as me. That means central heterochromia, with blue and grey rings around the edges, green-grey tone and brown in the center. And this dude used to have the brownest, most button eyes ever. And now they're light.

With some googling and friend help I figured out that eyes can change colour with age, genetics, health, and a multitude of other conditions. But what I was left wondering was how can the eyes and the rest of the body have so different colour profiles? My entire body doesn't produce any dark pigment but my eyes have some brown in them?

I have done both intermittent and extended fasting before. I want to try rolling 120s for a few weeks not only for weight loss, but to see if the longer period of autophagy helps my psoriasis improve which has gotten worse over time. I'm done with my first 5 day fast in a few hours but I have a few questions regarding it. 

What would be the ideal refeed window that gives me the nutrients I need for another 5 day fast without sacrificing the weight I lost? I was considering just one big meal, but I don't know if that would cause too much of a nutrient deficit. I've seen rolling 120s posts on here which are giving themselves a 2 day feeding window, but I wonder if that's too much for me. In case it matters, each time I will be breaking my fast with plain kefir then after a few hours I will be eating a large egg omelet with chicken sausage and veggies like peppers, onions, mushrooms and spinach. I'm also debating having a homemade smoothie made from strawberries, blueberries, bananas, acai, kefir, chia and flax seeds, but I'm also trying to watch my carb and sugar intake so if I'm getting everything I need from that omelet I'll probably skip it. Not sure if I am though. I have been taking two unsweetened LMNT packets with apple cider vinegar diluted water every day for my electrolytes. 

I'm worried about gallbladder issues potentially arising, but I read things like coffee with cream (I'd use half and half) and psyllium husk daily would stimulate the gallbladder to release bile to prevent any issues. But I read even consuming a small amount sugar, which would trigger an insulin response, or proteins would stop autophagy. Is this something I have to worry about here?

I first turned to it because I was going into college and dealing with not only a sleep disorder making it impossible to live on a ""normal"" schedule, but also dealing with depression that never went away after it started in February 2021.

I've basically been using caffeine to feel like a human since, but since around April 2024 (a month after my 2 month long health anxiety scare) I've slowly been falling into panic attacks and feelings of dread. I'll have entire multiple day spans where I feel like it's the end of the world, I feel like nothing will ever improve and I'll always suffer like this. Then I'll have multiple day/week episodes where I feel mostly fine and just drink copious amounts of caffiene with no issue. Then the dread slowly sets in again and it's rinse and repeat.

I'm trying to figure out if caffeine could be inducing these kinds of feelings and/or exacerbating them, because I genuinely don't know if I'm too dependent on caffeine or if it's something else. I think I only drink like 100-200mg of caffeine a day but I also seem to be really sensitive to it as well given that I was having *intense* lucid daydreams after drinking ~200mg of caffeine within a 4 hour span over the weekend. 

I'm believing this might be a cause because I had two coffees within a couple of hours of each other and I felt euphoric at first but now I'm just on the edge of a panic attack and it feels identical to the other panic attacks I've previously had. I'm not sure if it's the caffeine itself, if it's caffeine *crash* causing it, if it's some sort of withdrawal, or if it's completely unrelated to caffeine.

# The Victorian SEO Crisis: Why You're Paying a Premium to Lose

As a business owner in Victoria, you operate in Australia's most competitive and sophisticated market. You're driven, innovative, and world-class. You might be a leading tech firm in the Cremorne ""Silicon Yarra"" precinct, a high-end professional services firm on Collins Street, a major manufacturing business in Dandenong, or a renowned tourism operator on the Great Ocean Road. Yet despite your excellence, a huge, invisible force is actively working against your online success: a broken, inefficient, and outrageously expensive SEO market.

The Australian digital landscape is heavily dominated by a handful of agencies in Sydney and Melbourne that cater to the ASX 200. This leaves Victorian SMEs with a terrible choice: pay a ""Melbourne premium"" to an agency that uses outdated, manual methods, or try to do it yourself and get completely swamped. Both paths lead to the same destination: wasted money and missed opportunities. The foundation of digital growth, building high-quality backlinks, is where this crisis is most severe. Backlinks are the 'votes of trust' that Google uses to rank websites, but the traditional way of getting them is a slow, manual ""grind"" that is rigged in favour of those with the biggest budgets.

For an ambitious business in Geelong, a family-owned winery in the Yarra Valley, or a growing B2B company in the Melbourne CBD, the old system is a recipe for stagnation. The only way to win is to change the game with technology like [ai automatik link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

# The Flawed SEO Playbook for Victorian Businesses

If you've ever tried to improve your Google rankings with an [SEO agency in Melbourne](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/), this expensive and frustrating story will be all too familiar:

* **The ""Collins Street Agency"" Problem:** You sign a costly contract with a slick agency with a fancy address. They charge an eye-watering monthly retainer, and their ""strategy"" consists of writing a few blog posts and getting you some links from generic Australian websites that have zero authority or relevance in Victoria. They don't understand your specific industry or what your customers are actually looking for. You are paying for a brand name, not for results.
* **The Impossible Manual ""Grind"":** You decide to try building links yourself to save money. You or your team spend hundreds of valuable hours searching for Victorian blogs, news sites, and industry portals. The good ones are inundated with requests from around the world. Your polite, well-written emails simply get lost in the noise. The return on your time investment is devastatingly low.
* **The ""Guest Posting"" Time-Waster:** You're told the secret is to write ""thought leadership"" articles for other websites. You invest days of your time and intellectual property into crafting a brilliant piece, only for it to be rejected or published on a tiny, irrelevant blog with no readership. You are essentially working for free, building content for others with no tangible benefit for your own business. This is not a viable strategy for [SEO in Victoria](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).
* **Drowned Out by the Big Fish:** The Australian digital space is dominated by national giants in banking, retail, and services. They have massive, established backlink profiles built over years. Competing with their existing authority through manual link building is like trying to build a new Eureka Tower with a handful of bricks. It feels impossible to catch up.

This outdated model is a dead end. It is inefficient, unpredictable, and financially unsustainable for most Victorian businesses. It creates a digital ecosystem where Victorian companies are at a permanent disadvantage. But what if you could use technology to turn this situation into your greatest strength? What if you could use AI to completely bypass this broken system and use \*\*automatic link insertion\*\* to place your links directly into high-authority online articles that your target customers across Australia are already reading?

>""We run a specialised financial technology firm in Melbourne's CBD. We were paying a top-tier agency over $10,000 a month for SEO. The results were pathetic. It was all reports and no real impact. We needed a disruptive technology that could deliver real authority, not just billable hours. We needed AI MONSTER TOOL.""

# The Technological ""Hook Turn"": AI Automatic Link Insertion by AI MONSTER TOOL

It's time for a fundamental shift in your digital strategy. Stop thinking about ""building"" links. That is the old, slow way. The new, intelligent way is to \*insert\* them with surgical precision. This is the revolution of \*\*AI-powered automatic link insertion\*\*, a groundbreaking technology that is levelling the playing field for businesses everywhere, especially in a competitive market like Victoria. AI MONSTER TOOL is the undisputed leader in this new frontier.

The old strategy is like trying to get a new, unknown coffee cart a good spot on Degraves Street. It's difficult, competitive, and you have to hope people notice you. Our new strategy is like having a master key that lets you find the perfect empty spot in a major national publication and place your brand there instantly. Our advanced AI scans the web to find popular, high-authority articles already trusted by Google. Then, it identifies the perfect, contextually relevant ""gap"" within that article to insert a link to your website. This is what our [automated link insertion](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/) software does for your business online, giving you immediate exposure to a high-value, existing audience.

# How AI Automatic Link Insertion Gives You a Decisive Advantage in Victoria:

* **Step 1: Deep Semantic Analysis of Australian & Victorian Content:** Our AI reads and understands millions of articles from Australian news sites (like The Age, The Herald Sun), popular blogs, industry journals, and government sites. It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the precise topic and context of every page, with a special focus on content relevant to Victoria's key sectors.
* **Step 2: Identifying High-Value ""Link Gaps"":** The AI finds specific sentences within this high-authority content where a link to your website would be a natural, helpful addition for the reader. For example, it might find a national travel article about the Great Ocean Road that doesn't link to a specific accommodation provider in Lorne or Apollo Bay. If you are that provider, our AI finds that priceless opportunity. This is not just link building; this is intelligent \*\*link insertion from AI MONSTER TOOL\*\*.
* **Step 3: Uncovering ""Lost"" Victorian-Related Mentions:** Our system constantly scans the web for mentions of your company name, your projects, or your key people that are not linked. These are the easiest, most powerful links you can get. The AI finds these ""unlinked brand mentions"" on sites across Australia and prepares them for automated link acquisition, instantly connecting your business to existing conversations about your region and industry.
* **Step 4: Automated, Scalable, and Precise Placement:** This is the core innovation of AI MONSTER TOOL. Using a network of publisher partnerships and advanced API communications, our software automates the process of securing the link insertion within the identified ""link gap."" This happens at a scale and speed that no human team or traditional agency could ever achieve. This is the pinnacle of [ai automatik link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/) technology.

Imagine the power of this. Every month, a steady stream of new, powerful, contextual links pointing to your website from articles that Google already trusts and ranks highly, all reinforcing your expertise in Victoria. The impact on your search engine rankings, your brand visibility, and your ability to win new customers from Melbourne to Mildura and beyond is transformative. This isn't a future promise; it's the reality AI MONSTER TOOL delivers to Victorian businesses today.

# Stop Playing by Their Rules. It's Time to Win.

# My business is in Geelong. Can you help me compete with Melbourne-based companies?

# We are based on the Mornington Peninsula. How do you cater to the tourism and lifestyle market?

For a business in tourism, hospitality, wine, or high-end services, our AI will prioritize link opportunities on national travel websites, luxury lifestyle blogs, wedding guides, and food and wine publications.

# Can this help my B2B business in an industrial suburb of Melbourne?

Yes. The strength of our AI is its precision. For a B2B business in an industrial area like **Dandenong**, **Laverton**, or **Campbellfield**, our AI finds placements in national manufacturing journals, logistics publications, and business news websites. It can take your specialised local expertise and give it a national platform, helping you win bigger contracts from all over Australia. This is the power of a true [ai automatik link building](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/) strategy.

# How is this different and better than just buying links?

""Buying links"" usually means paying for a link on a low-quality, toxic website (a ""link farm"" or PBN) that will eventually get your site penalized by Google. It is a very risky and short-term tactic. Our AI-powered link insertion is completely different. We earn placements on legitimate, high-authority websites where your link adds real value. It is a safe, sustainable, and powerful white-hat strategy that builds long-term brand equity.

# How quickly can I expect to see results for my Victorian business?

I'm blind, so sometimes I find it hard to go to bars and talk to random people (although I did it this week and it went really well!), but I'd like to know if you have any tips, apps, or events where it's easier to meet and hang out with people in the city? 

Also if anyone wants to go for a walk, or for a coffee or aperitivo, please reach out! I'm extremely open-minded and I speak Spanish, English, and a little Italian (I'm learning!), and I love learning about other realities and ways of life.

Extract ⬇️⬇️⬇️ (taken from Facebook) 

My childhood friend, Javier Hudson, beat my boyfriend within an inch of his life just to possess me.
Then he dragged me to his private amusement park, locked me inside, and said,
""Katherine, this is the playground I specially made for you, your favorite place! From now on, you’re not allowed to escape from me even a step!""
""But I don’t love you!""
""That’s fine. Because now, I’m all you have.""
He was obsessive and insane. Any woman who looked even remotely like me, he had to have.
Especially one college girl who looked almost identical to me, with the same stubborn streak.
When she saw me, she tortured me until I was covered in bruises and scars, then stuffed me into a suitcase.
In the end, she presented me to Javier like some kind of trophy.
""Honey, a bltch snuck into the park. Don't worry, I’ve dealt with her and the child in her belly!""
——
Javier Hudson wasn't just some possessive CEO. He was the obsessive, broken kind. And we'd grown up together.
He'd always been unreasonably fixated on me. His room was wallpapered with photos of me. His diaries were page after page of declarations of love.
No matter how many times I told him I already had a boyfriend and didn't love him at all, Javier remained obsessively twisted, bordering on pathological.
Two years ago, I got the news that my parents had died in a car crash. My boyfriend and I came back to the country for the funeral.
But the moment we landed, his people surrounded us.
My boyfriend tried to protect me, but Javier showed up in person—and calmly snapped his fingers one by one.
I'm begging him to let my boyfriend go.
Javier held my chin in his hand, looking like the very picture of love and tenderness. ""Katherine, if you come with me, I'll spare his life.""
I had no choice but to give in. I couldn't drag my boyfriend down with me.
But I have never seen my boyfriend again in the two years since then.
Javier brought me to this massive private amusement park.
He waved his bodyguards away, then picked me up and set me on a wooden horse. He sat behind me, arms around my waist, completely intoxicated.
""Katherine, you loved amusement parks so much when we were little. But your parents were always too nervous to let you go.
""Well, look—I built this one just for you. From now on, this is where you live. You're not allowed to leave me, you hear?""
I turned my face away and said nothing.
All I could think about was my boyfriend. He was a piano genius. His hands were his life. But Javier had destroyed them. What kind of life was he living now?
When he saw I was distracted, Javier grew angry. He forced my face back toward his.
""Still thinking about him, huh?
""I won't allow it. From now on, I'm the only one you're allowed to love.""
I stared him down. ""Javier, I've never loved you. And I never will.""
He froze, then gave me this devilish smile.
""That's okay. Like I said, now, I'm all you've got.""
I tried escaping again and again, but every single time, they dragged me back.
The last time I got caught, Javier snapped.
""Women are throwing themselves at me left and right. If you don't want me, fine—I'll give my time to someone who does!""
He started surrounding himself with women who looked like me.
One after another, they came and went. Gossip followed him like a shadow.
The only upside was that he was so busy with other women he didn't have as much time to bother me.
One day, I was making coffee when I suddenly heard a bunch of shouting outside.
""I'm going to be the future Mrs. Hudson! This whole amusement park was a surprise Javier prepared just for me. Why shouldn't I be allowed in?""
The woman's voice was arrogant and sharp as a whip. She was yelling straight at the security guards.
They looked unsure, like they didn't want to let her in, but didn't dare stop her either.
""If you make me angry and Javier finds out, you'll all be out of a job!""
Then, just like that, she shoved past them, leading a pack of girls right into the park.
I froze, my heart racing.
""Was this it? Was this finally my chance to escape?"" I wondered.
 
Chapter 2
I dropped what I held and dashed toward the exit, trying to escape the chaos.
It was rare for anyone to visit the amusement park, which had been deserted for two years.
Now, about seven or eight girls burst in, clearly excited.
They looked young, like recent college graduates, their eyes wide with wonder as they took everything in.
""Kate, your man must be head over heels for you! Is this whole amusement park private? Imagine how much it costs to build!""
""This kind of luxury theme park isn't even open to the public. It's just for you? That's literally the kind of stuff princesses get in fairy tales!""
""Just how big is this place? Kate, show us around—we're dying to see more!""
The girl leading the group was dressed to impress, clearly loving the attention.
""This is nothing. Javier is the richest man in Los Angeles. Building this amusement park only costs billions. He said as long as I'm happy, nothing else matters!""
Her words made me freeze on the spot.
I slowly turned around and studied her face. With all that makeup, she looked almost exactly like the girl in the photo Javier once threw at me.
The whole group suddenly went quiet before I could snap out of it.
All their eyes were locked on me.
""Kate, didn't you say this amusement park was a private gift, and no one else was allowed in? Then who's she?""
Kate's face dropped.
She looked me up and down, and the moment she saw my face clearly, her expression soured. She jabbed a finger at me and screamed.
""This whole place is a surprise Javier set up just for me! Who let this woman in?!""
Her classmates started stirring things up even more.
""Look at her—her face kinda looks like yours! She probably had it done to copy you!""
""Didn't you say Mr. Hudson was supposed to show up here sometime soon? I bet she found out ahead of time and snuck in to seduce him!""
""Totally. She's just a cheap little vixen trying to steal your spot. We should teach her a lesson!""
Realizing they had it all wrong, I quickly waved my hands to explain.
""No, no, I just got lost. Total accident! I'll leave right now. Just pretend you didn't see me, okay?""
I turned to bolt, but someone yanked me back by my collar.
Kate sneered and slapped me across the face, hard.
""Use your brain next time you lie. This is Javier's private amusement park. There are like a dozen guards at the gates. You think someone could just 'get lost' and wander in? Not even an ant could sneak past them!""
 
Chapter 3
The slap came out of nowhere. My cheek burned, and my hand shot up instinctively—but I stopped myself halfway and let it drop.
""Wait a sec, did you just say you're Javier's girlfriend?""
Kate let out a proud little laugh. ""I didn't—but what, are you saying you are?""
I kept my voice calm. ""Look, we're both women. Let me give you some advice—don't stay here too long. You'll regret it.""
My cheek still stung from the slap.
I pressed my palm against it and added, ""And that hit you just gave me? I'll let it go. But take my word for it—you must get out of here.""
Among the many girlfriends Javier cycled through, one or two didn't know any better and insisted on picking a fight with me.
One of them tried to spy on me from a corner of the park—he gouged her eyes out.
Another tried climbing over the wall to see what this amusement park looked like—she vanished without a trace.
That's the kind of monster Javier is.
Kate Larkin may have been around longer than the others, but that was because her face looked like mine.
Even her name came from me.
I was just trying to find a way to escape, but they'd surrounded me too tightly.
So I tried reasoning with her again—but she didn't want to hear it.
Instead, she slapped me a few more times.
""You dirty bltch! You think you can play innocent and sneak around Javier? Acting like you're here out of the goodness of your heart—what a joke!
""You clearly need someone to put you in your place! I'm the one in charge here now!""
I almost laughed.
In charge? I'd been locked in this place for over two years. This so-called luxury park was nothing but a shiny cage.
And now someone thought they could come in here and play queen?
I caught Kate's hand before she could strike again, my eyes turning cold.
""You really think Javier is some amazing guy? He's a demon.
""If you want to die a horrible death, keep hanging around. You know why you look like me? Because you're nothing but a stand-in.""
""I'm Katherine Bennett—the girl Javier locked up in here. His first love.""
This girl was still so young—she had her whole life ahead of her.
I didn't want her to get tricked like this.
And I sure she didn't want her spending her life living in someone else's shadow.
But to my surprise, she and her friends burst out laughing the moment I finished speaking.
""You dirty slvt. Wow, you've got some nerve. Do you even know who Javier is? He's the richest successor in Los Angeles!""
""If he's not a good man, then there's no such thing as a good man in this world!""
""First love, my *ss. You're just trying to cling to him! Girls, I've got time today—let's teach this bltch a lesson!
""Hold her down!""
All seven or eight of them jumped at me, arms and legs flying.
Panic surged through me. ""What are you doing?!""
Kate stood with her arms crossed just outside the circle, sneering as she gave orders.
""You all know what to do. Make me happy, and dinner's on me tonight.""
They gave off the exact vibe of petty bullies who'd done this sort of thing before.
""Don't worry, Kate—we'll take care of it!""
""We can't stand bltches like this who try to steal other people's men. I swear, if I don't strip her down today, I'll never show my face again.""
I fought with everything I had, trying to dodge, but punches and kicks started raining down like a storm.
One girl kicked me while yelling, ""Die, you skunk! We can't even get close to someone like Mr. Hudson. What makes you think you can?""
""Trying to copy Kate's face? You shameless bltch! I'm gonna beat you to death today!""
I don't know who made the first move, but someone came at me and started tearing at my clothes.
""I didn't get plastic surgery! This is my real face!""
I clutched my collar tightly. ""Stop! If you keep this up, none of you will get away with it!""
Someone laughed coldly. ""Oh, please, who are you trying to scare? Girls, hold her down—don't leave a single piece of underwear on her!""
The sound of fabric ripping filled the air.
Clothes started hitting the ground. Then someone picked up a piece and spoke in surprise.
""Holy crap, this brand is Bulgari. How can someone like her afford something this expensive?""
Kate scoffed, filing her nails. ""As if. Do you even know how much a piece from Bulgari costs? Millions.
""She couldn't afford this even if she sold herself. You must've misread it.""
The girl looked skeptical but still held up the clothes and handed them to Kate.
""No, really, Kate—I swear I'm not wrong. Look for yourself.""
Kate took it up, clearly annoyed, until she took one look at the label.
Her expression froze.
 
Chapter 4
""Bulgari? How's that possible?!""
She grabbed the piece of clothing and checked it over and over again. When she finally accepted it was real, her gaze turned vicious.
""I asked Javier for this brand before, and he wouldn't get it for me. But this bltch is wearing it?!""
Just then, another girl came running out from the nearby villa.
""Kate! I just saw inside the closet—it's full of Bulgari! Mr. Hudson must've prepared it all for you!""
Kate's face immediately lit up, and she looked at me like she'd solved some great mystery.
""So that's it! This slvt snuck in here and wore my clothes! I knew it—Javier only ever spoils me! She must've put on my outfit to try and seduce him!""
My hands and feet were pinned down, and someone had already slapped duct tape over my mouth.
I shook my head desperately, but I couldn't make a sound.
Those clothes? They weren't hers. Javier had custom-made every piece for me, paying obscene amounts of money without blinking an eye.
That villa? Just a gilded cage where I'd been kept, a pretty little bird locked inside.
Someone asked, ""Kate, what should we do with this bltch?""
Kate grinned wickedly.
She pointed at the carousel not far away.
""Toss her on the merry-go-round. And someone find a stick—about as thick as an arm.""
As soon as she said it, they all started laughing like they'd been waiting for this.
""Kate, you're a genius!""
The group dragged me across the ground and threw me down. My skin scraped against the hard floor until blood began to seep through.
The more they hurt me, the more excited they got.
""Put her on the carousel!""
I struggled with all my strength, trying to break free, but someone slapped me unconscious, and the next thing I knew, I was tied down to one of the horses.
""What's a merry-go-round without a spin? Let's get it moving!""
As it started to turn, Kate picked up the stick and began beating my stomach with it, again and again.
Their laughter rang through the air as pain exploded in my lower body.
I don't know how long it lasted. I was on the verge of passing out when someone suddenly shouted, ""Look! She's bleeding!""
I forced myself to open my eyes.
Sure enough, bright red blood was running down my upper lgs.
The place fell silent. Then a girl wearing glasses said, ""Kate, I think she might be expecting. She looks like she's two or three months in.""
Kate's face darkened immediately. ""Are you sure you're not mistaken?""
The girl answered firmly, ""No mistake. Did you forget I'm a medical student?""
Kate's expression turned downright soured, her eyes welling with tears.
""Don't tell me she really is Javier's secret lover? He told me I was the only one! How could he do this to me?!""
Someone quickly jumped in, trying to calm her down. ""That might not be it! I've heard there are guides online about this—women get expecting with someone else's kid and pretend it's a rich man's baby. Maybe that's what she's doing!""
""Exactly! That child in her stomach definitely isn't Javier's!""
Kate's face twisted with hatred, her eyes on me like venom.
Then, as if struck with inspiration, she sneered. ""So she's expecting, huh? Well, let's give her a ride on the Drop Tower!""
The crowd burst into applause and laughter.
They dragged me toward the ride. I thrashed and fought with everything I had, and with the sweat and tears running down my face, the tape over my mouth finally loosened.
I shouted at the top of my lungs.
""This baby belongs to Javier! If anything happens to it, all of you are dead!""
But they just laughed harder, not believing a word I said.
""Still talking big? We'll see how cocky you are in a minute!""
""Throw her on!""
I couldn't fight them off. They had the numbers, and I was weak. Before I could even find my balance, they shoved me onto the Drop Tower.
The moment I dropped, the violent loss of gravity felt like I was in a nightmare.
I was still bleeding from the carousel ride. I could feel it—something inside me slipping away.
I shut my eyes in despair.
This baby had always been a little fighter. I'd tried so many times to get rid of it, and it still held on.
But this time, I knew I couldn't save it.
It's okay.
""Kid, don't come back to me next time,"" I said in my mind.
Just then, a security guard came rushing toward us, panicked and breathless.
His face was ghostly pale.
""Mr. Hudson is on his way! What are you girls doing?!""
 
Chapter 5
Kate gave a cold, dismissive laugh and pointed lazily at me, dangling there half-conscious.
""We're just punishing a slvt. Perfect timing—Javier can see for himself. I'll go tell him all about it in a second!""
The security guard looked completely confused. ""Ms. Larkin, you're the only ones who came in today. There's no one else in the park.""
As he spoke, he instinctively glanced down.
And the moment he saw my face, his expression went white as a sheet. His legs nearly gave out.
""Do you even know what you're doing?!""
He panicked. ""Do you have any idea who she is?! Get her down, now!""
Kate noticed the guard's reaction—he clearly recognized me.
Still, she didn't back down. 
She scoffed. ""What, her? She's just a gold digger trying to seduce Javier. And she's carrying some random idot's child—why would Javier ever care about her…""
Before she could finish, the guard rushed to pull the lever and lift me back up.
When he saw my body, without clothes, covered in bruises and blood, completely unconscious, his face turned utterly ashen.
""This is bad. Really bad!
""She's Mr. Hudson's precious woman. No one's allowed to even touch her!
""And you tortured her like this? Are you all out of your minds?! You've got a death wish!
""Ms. Larkin, even if you don't care about your life, don't drag me down with you!""
Kate saw the security guard so scared he looked like he might wet themselves.
Her expression finally turned worried.
Behind her, some classmates began to voice their doubts.
""Wait, didn't you say you were the only woman close to Mr. Hudson?""
""Wait, you didn't know he was keeping another woman hidden away? Don't tell me this entire luxury amusement park wasn't even built for you?""
""No way!""
Kate's face turned grim. ""Javier paid for my elite university tuition and bought me jewelry worth millions. How could this amusement park not be for me?!""
She shot the guard a deadly glare.
""Don't listen to his nonsense! Once Javier gets here, I'll tell him exactly what happened!""
The security guard was in full panic mode now, rushing to check on me, where I lay unconscious.
""We can't let Mr. Hudson see this!
""If he finds out, we're all dead meat!""
He wasn't faking it—his fear was real. He called over a few more guards to help.
Somehow, they dragged over a 28-inch suitcase. One of them hastily threw a coat on me, then stuffed me inside and zipped it shut.
""We'll hide her until Mr. Hudson leaves the park. Sorry, Ms. Bennett—we've got no choice!""
Just as they zipped the suitcase closed, a sleek black luxury car rolled into the private lot.
Javier stepped out, drawing gasps from the girls around.
Dressed in a sharp suit and gold-rimmed glasses, he looked like the very definition of a dangerous gentleman.
Kate and her friends were completely starstruck.
""Oh my God, Mr. Hudson is so handsome!""
""If I could date a man like that, I'd trade 30 years of my life!""
""Kate, you wouldn't mind if we joined you for dinner with him, right?""
Flushed with pride from all the flattery, Kate smiled like she owned the place.
""Just watch."" Kate sneered. ""My place in Javier's heart isn't something you little minnows can ever compete with!""
Javier walked straight toward the villa without sparing anyone a glance.
Kate dashed after him, throwing herself into his arms for everyone to see. She wrapped her arms around his waist like she was showing off a trophy.
""Javier, I missed you so much!
""You won't believe it—a shameless woman sneaked into the park just now. She was expecting, too! But don't worry, I cared for both her and that child!""",1,1750367680.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1lfm7l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1lfm7l8/retire_abroad_or_stay_local_key_questions_answered/,Retire Abroad or Stay Local? Key Questions Answered,"**Retire Abroad or Stay Local? The Age-Old Dilemma**

Okay, friends! Can we take a moment to talk about something that’s been swirling around my mind like a piña colada in a beachside bar? 🍹 The big question that many of us face as we approach that glorious stage of life known as retirement: **Should I retire abroad, or is it better to stay local?** 

Let’s be real – it can feel a bit overwhelming, can’t it? The thought of uprooting your life or staying put. But guess what? There’s a world of adventure waiting out there, plus all the comforts of home at your fingertips. 

So, to help us all navigate this decision, let’s break down some key questions that might just steer us toward the right choice. 

**1. What kind of lifestyle am I craving?**  
- Do you picture yourself sipping coffee while staring at an ocean view every morning? 🌊  
- Or is the thought of a familiar park down the street, where you know the best picnic spots, more your vibe? 🍃  

**2. How’s the cost of living looking?**  
- Some countries offer a gloriously low cost of living – I’m talking about having a reasonable budget without living like a hermit crab! 🦀✨  
- In contrast, staying local can be riddled with hidden costs that surprise even the savviest retirees. Anyone here had a heart attack over property taxes? 💸  

**3. What about community and support?**  
- This one’s big. Are you going to have your family and old pals cheering you on as you navigate those golden years? 🤗  
- Or will you be a lone wolf (or should I say, a lone retiree), forging new friendships while learning how to say “where's the best taco truck?” in a new language? 🌮  

**4. What about healthcare and safety?**  
- If you think about moving abroad, let’s chat about medical care. Is it top-notch, or are we talking sketchy clinics with questionable advice (you know, “just rub some dirt on it”)? 💉  
- Staying local? Make sure your health care system has you covered, especially if you have any ongoing needs.

**5. Do I crave adventure or routine?**  
- Can you imagine soaking in the local culture, learning to dance the tango, or tasting exotic cuisines? 🍽️ So many tales to tell!  
- On the flip side, maybe routine and predictability sound like music to your ears. There’s something comforting about knowing how to navigate the check-out line at the grocery store, right? 😅

I have been seriously stalking this page and I think I have come up with a rough itinerary but wanted to run it by you all first to get your input. For context there will be four adults - 1 in 50s and 3 in 20s, all moderately active. We have a mix of interests with an emphasis leaning towards good beach and relaxation/ hiking but also rich culture and some evening events (salsa/bachata dancing and drinks). We will also likely be renting a car. 

We will have about 10 days and plan to split them between the main island and Vieques. 

Arrive in San Juan and go to Vieques for 4-5 days to do as much beach time as possible. 

Get back to main island and then split time between Luquillo (3 days) and Old San Juan (3 days).

On the main island trying to figure out how to spend the days. 

My thoughts are: 

\- A day at El Yunque or Gozalandia 

\-  a day (at least) in OSJ. 

\- From there I was thinking one day to do Zip Lines at ToroVerde 

\- maybe one day to do either coffee or rum tasting. 

Happy to also relax on beach in Luquillo. 

I wanted to get to spend time on the west side of the island but likely won't have time so I'll have to come back (darnnnn). 

Let me know your thoughts and if there is something that doesn't work or you would absolutely change! Thank you!

I feel so stupid having to ask, but: 

So my clumsy self accidentally knocked over my GFCI outlet, and maybe a little through the top of the outlet where it's supposed to be flush against the wall, as some of the coffee that spilled went over it.  It's as flush to the wall as its going to get, but it looks like there are tiny holes in the top part that suggest it's not any sort of barrier. 

How do I safely clean any coffee out, and how would I know it's ok to use again?

I’m stoked for my upcoming Vietnam trip and wanted to share some tips I’ve picked up from friends and research. This place is a vibe—amazing food, stunning views, and warm people. Here’s what I’ve learned to make your trip smooth and fun. Drop your own tips below!

1.  Plan, But Go with the FlowHit up Hanoi (Old Quarter), Hoi An (Ancient Town), Ha Long Bay, and Ho Chi Minh City (Ben Thanh Market). Don’t skip Ninh Binh or Phong Nha for off-the-beaten-path gems. Tip: Book flights or overnight trains for long distances, but leave room for spontaneous adventures!

2.  Visa StuffMost folks need an e-visa (~$25, apply online a week early). Bring a printed copy and a passport photo. Passport must be valid 6+ months.

3.  Cash RulesVietnamese Dong is king. ATMs are easy to find, but small vendors prefer cash. Withdraw from Vietcombank to dodge high fees. Tell your bank you’re traveling!

4.  Cross Streets Like a ProScooter chaos is real, especially in Hanoi. Walk slow and steady—drivers will dodge you. Watch locals and channel your inner calm.

5.  Eat All the ThingsPho, banh mi, and Vietnamese coffee are life-changing (~$1-3). Hit busy street stalls for the best bites. Stick to bottled water and ease into street food if your stomach’s picky.

6.  Learn a Few Words“Xin chào” (hello) and “cảm ơn” (thank you) go a long way. Google Translate offline is a lifesaver for menus.

7.  Dress SmartPack light, breathable clothes for humidity. Cover shoulders/knees at temples. Raincoat for sudden showers (May-Oct is rainy season).

8.  Getting AroundGrab app for cheap, reliable taxis/scooters. Overnight buses save cash but can be tight—trains are comfier. Rent a scooter only if you’re confident (helmet + International Driving Permit).

9.  Haggle KindlyBargain in markets (start at 60% of the price), but keep it friendly. Confirm taxi prices upfront.

10.  Stay SafeVietnam’s pretty chill, but watch for small scams (fake tours, overpriced taxis). Book with reputable agencies and keep valuables low-key.

11.  When to GoNorth: Mar-Apr or Sep-Nov. Central: Feb-Aug. South: Dec-Apr. Rainy season’s lush but wet, so pack accordingly.
Bonus: Grab a Viettel SIM at the airport (~$10 for 30 days of data). Wi-Fi’s common, but data’s handy for maps.

1lflv42,https://rrmaids.com,How Professional Cleaning Saves Time for Busy Families in Louisville,"# Refresh Your Home, Refresh Your Summer: The Ultimate Guide to a Stress-Free Space

Summer is here, bringing longer days, warm breezes, and the perfect excuse to slow down and enjoy life a little more. But if your home is cluttered, dusty, or just plain chaotic, it’s hard to truly relax and soak up the season. A clean, organized home is the foundation of self-care, setting the stage for a summer filled with peace, joy, and stress-free living.

At **Rocking Robin’s Maids**, we believe that your home should be a sanctuary, not another source of stress. Let’s dive into the best ways to refresh your space, so you can fully embrace summer with open arms. With a few intentional changes, your home can become a tranquil retreat where you can unwind after long summer days, host gatherings with ease, and truly feel at peace in your surroundings. The key to a perfect summer starts with a space that makes you feel light, energized, and completely at home.

# Declutter to Destress

Clutter isn’t just an eyesore—it can actually increase anxiety, drain your energy, and make it harder to focus. Studies have shown that an organized environment leads to lower stress levels and improved productivity. If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed walking into a messy room, you’re not alone. A cluttered space can lead to a cluttered mind, making it difficult to fully relax. Start your summer self-care journey by tackling the mess one step at a time. Here’s how:

* **The 15-Minute Rule** – Set a timer and focus on one small area at a time, whether it’s a kitchen drawer or your bedside table. Short, consistent sessions prevent burnout and make the process more manageable.
* **One-In, One-Out Policy** – If you bring in something new (like a beach bag or summer clothes), donate or toss something you no longer use. This keeps your space balanced and prevents unnecessary clutter from accumulating.
* **Seasonal Swap** – Store away heavy winter blankets, coats, and decor to make room for lighter, breezier items. Consider vacuum-sealed bags to save space and keep your winter items fresh for the next season.
* **Declutter Sentimentally** – It can be hard to part with certain items, but try to keep only things that truly bring you joy or serve a purpose. Donate gently used items to those in need, adding a layer of feel-good self-care to your summer refresh.

Less clutter means less stress, giving you more mental space to enjoy summer’s simple pleasures. Imagine walking into a room that feels open, clean, and inviting—it’s an instant mood booster! Taking the time to declutter now sets you up for a summer filled with ease, relaxation, and stress-free living.

# Deep Clean for a Fresh Start

Once you’ve decluttered, it’s time to give your home a true summer refresh with a deep clean. Think of it as a reset for your space! A deep-cleaned home not only looks good but also contributes to your health and well-being by eliminating dust, allergens, and bacteria. If you’ve been procrastinating, now is the perfect time to roll up your sleeves and get started. Here are the must-hit areas:

# 1. Dust and Allergens Be Gone!

Warmer weather means open windows, fresh air, and… more dust and pollen. Keeping allergens at bay will make your home feel fresher and help prevent summer sneezes. Try these cleaning tips:

* Dust ceiling fans, air vents, and baseboards, as these spots collect dust quickly and often go unnoticed.
* Wash curtains, vacuum upholstered furniture, and deep clean carpets to eliminate hidden dust and pet dander.
* Swap out air filters to improve indoor air quality. Opt for high-efficiency filters that trap smaller particles for cleaner, healthier air.
* Wipe down window sills and screens to remove built-up dirt and pollen that can sneak into your home.

# 2. Refresh the Kitchen

Summer calls for fresh, light meals, so make sure your kitchen is a space where you love to cook. A clean kitchen is not only more inviting but also helps keep pests away. Here’s how to get it summer-ready:

* Wipe down the fridge, tossing expired condiments and leftovers. Take this opportunity to reorganize shelves and make healthy summer snacks easily accessible.
* Clean small appliances like your coffee maker, toaster, and blender, as they tend to accumulate grime over time.
* Scrub the sink and garbage disposal to eliminate lingering odors. Drop in a few lemon peels and run the disposal for a natural, fresh scent.
* Declutter countertops by storing away appliances you don’t use daily, creating a more open and inviting space.

# 3. Revive Your Bathroom

Nothing says self-care like a spa-like bathroom. A fresh, clean bathroom enhances your daily routine and makes self-care feel more luxurious. Keep it fresh by:

* Scrubbing grout and tile to remove mold and mildew, making your space feel brand new.
* Replacing old bath mats and towels with fresh, airy fabrics in bright or neutral tones for a summer-ready vibe.
* Stocking up on your favorite summer-scented soaps, lotions, and bath salts. Think coconut, citrus, and floral scents that bring vacation vibes into your home.
* Organizing toiletries and discarding expired products to keep your space tidy and clutter-free.

# 4. Summer-Proof Your Floors

With more foot traffic (and maybe some sandy toes), your floors need extra love. Keeping them clean prevents buildup and extends their lifespan. Here’s how:

* Sweep and mop hardwood or tile floors more frequently to remove dirt and allergens.
* Shampoo carpets or invest in a professional deep cleaning to refresh fibers and remove any hidden dirt.
* Place doormats at entrances to catch dirt before it spreads. Choose washable mats for easy upkeep.
* Consider removing shoes indoors to keep floors cleaner and reduce wear and tear.

# Create a Relaxing Atmosphere

A clean home is just the beginning—now it’s time to transform your space into a true summer retreat. The ambiance of your home plays a huge role in how relaxed and happy you feel. Here’s how:

* **Let the Light In** – Swap heavy curtains for sheer panels to let in natural light and brighten up your space. Sunlight has been shown to boost mood and energy levels.
* **Incorporate Natural Elements** – Bring the outdoors in with potted plants, fresh flowers, or a small herb garden in the kitchen. Greenery adds a sense of tranquility and purifies the air.
* **Use Light, Airy Scents** – Essential oils, scented candles, or linen sprays in fragrances like citrus, lavender, or eucalyptus can make your home feel fresh and inviting. Scent has a powerful impact on mood, so choose uplifting and soothing options.
* **Rearrange for Comfort** – Move furniture to create open, breezy spaces that encourage relaxation. Less is more when it comes to a peaceful home layout.
* **Add Soft Textures** – Lightweight throws, soft rugs, and linen pillow covers can make your space feel cozy yet cool for summer lounging.

Keeping a clean home is a challenge for many busy families in Louisville. Between work, school, errands, and family time, finding the energy to vacuum, dust, or scrub the bathroom can feel impossible. Fortunately, hiring a professional cleaning service can be a game-changer.

Rocking Robins Maids is here to help families reclaim their free time while ensuring their homes remain spotless. Let’s explore how professional cleaning can save you time, reduce stress, and improve your overall quality of life.

# The Time-Saving Benefits of Professional Cleaning

# 1. Less Time Cleaning, More Time for What Matters

On average, Americans spend six hours per week cleaning their homes. For parents and professionals, that’s six hours that could be spent on quality family time, self-care, or even getting ahead at work.

By outsourcing your cleaning needs to Rocking Robins Maids, you instantly free up time to:

* Enjoy weekend outings with your kids.
* Focus on your career or side hustle.
* Unwind with a good book or TV show.

Why spend your valuable free time scrubbing floors when someone else can do it for you?

# 2. Flexible Scheduling to Fit Your Busy Life

One of the biggest perks of hiring professional cleaners is the ability to schedule services at your convenience. Whether you need:

✅ Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly cleaning services.  
✅ One-time deep cleaning before a special event.  
✅ Move-in/move-out cleaning to simplify your relocation.

Rocking Robins Maids offers flexible plans tailored to your household’s needs.

# 3. A Consistently Clean Home Without the Effort

Maintaining a clean home is difficult when life gets busy. Dishes pile up, dust collects, and laundry seems endless. With recurring professional cleaning, your home remains fresh and tidy without you having to lift a finger.

A clean home isn’t just about appearances—it also creates a healthier living environment by reducing allergens, bacteria, and mold.

# The Real Cost of DIY Cleaning vs. Hiring a Maid Service

Many people hesitate to hire a cleaning service due to cost concerns. But when you break it down, the time you spend cleaning costs you more than hiring a professional.

|Cleaning Task|DIY Cleaning Time|Professional Cleaning Time|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Vacuuming & Mopping|1-2 hours/week|30-45 minutes|
|Kitchen Cleaning|2-3 hours/week|1 hour|
|Bathroom Scrubbing|1-2 hours/week|45 minutes|
|Laundry & Tidying|3-4 hours/week|N/A (if included in service)|

Total Time Spent Cleaning: 6-10 hours per week!  
With Rocking Robins Maids, you can cut that time to nearly zero while ensuring your home stays pristine.

# How Professional Cleaning Reduces Stress for Families

# 1. A Tidy Home = A Clear Mind

Studies show that a cluttered, messy environment increases stress and anxiety. When you come home to a clean space, it promotes relaxation and productivity.

Parents juggling work, school drop-offs, and meal prep don’t need the extra burden of a messy house. Hiring a professional cleaner eliminates this worry and creates a peaceful home environment.

# 2. More Time for Family & Self-Care

After a long day, the last thing you want is to spend your evening scrubbing toilets or vacuuming carpets. Instead of using your weekends to clean, imagine:

* Playing board games with your kids.
* Enjoying a stress-free date night.
* Taking a well-deserved nap.

With a maid service, you reclaim hours of your life for the things that truly matter.

# 3. No More Last-Minute Cleaning Panics

Ever had unexpected guests and panicked over the state of your home? With professional cleaning, you’ll always be company-ready. No more scrambling to vacuum before visitors arrive—just a consistently fresh and inviting space.

1lflul6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lflul6,Modern Tudor Parlor Room,"I bought home with Tudor-inspired architecture. I envision this room serving as a sitting area/parlor room with modern Tudor decor. I'll l be replacing the lighting fixture and possibly incorporating cove lighting where I
marked in yellow. In the red area I was
thinking either wallpaper or paint. The tiered ceiling is throwing me for a loop. The floors are Brazilian cherry and I really want to tone down the prominence of the redness in this space.

Initial furniture/decor thoughts are a combination of: sofa, love seat, wing back chair, coffee table, chaise, side table, and/or an oversized painting. I have a dark blue velvet sofa in the living room and think I'd want to carry either that rich color or another into the parlor room.

What should I do to draw the eye upward and really play with the height and width of the room? lf I have furniture with color, how can I best balance it with the red of the floors? I find wallpaper a little intimidating but cool and I wonder if it would even be right for the space? I want this to be an elevated but modern space for entertaining that appears tall and expansive.

You did it. Congrats. Absolute masterpiece.

The ""new assassin items""? Yeah. Totally designed for assassins. Sure.

>

Shaco now feels like playing a depressed clown who's trying to assassinate his own will to play.  
I miss the old Duskblade. I miss the old Lord Dominik. I miss when Shaco was *actually* playable for fun.

**Boxes?**  
You mean that decorative cardboard we pretend is a trap?

* Teemo throws a mushroom: *instant trigger*
* Shaco places a box: *""Please wait while your trap is being processed...""*
* Enemy casually walks out of range
* Outcome of entire fight changes because my box is having a coffee break.

**And the cherry on top — experience gain.**  
17 minutes into the game:

* 3 crabs, 2 dragons, 2 Voidgrubs, 126 CS, 11 kills, 1 death = Level 9 Meanwhile enemy Jax:
* 1 Voidgrub, 98 CS, 6 kills = Level 11

**EXPLAIN THAT RIOT. I DARE YOU.**

I swear, sometimes it feels like RIOT intentionally nerfs Shaco every patch just because we're Shaco mains.  
And if you dare complain?

But hey, no worries. You can always drop $500 on another skin for no reason.  
**Peak balance.**

I would also like to share my build **Shonic** (its not for rank)

1lflpx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1lflpx1/years_of_suffering_obsessively_managing_my_health/,"Years of suffering, obsessively managing my health","I’m at my breaking point.

I’ve been dealing with relentless stomach issues for 7 years—burning, nausea, random flare-ups, and a constant feeling of something being wrong. I’ve followed every lifestyle and diet change obsessively for years. No coffee, no alcohol, low acid, low fat, no trigger foods. You name it—I’ve done it. Religiously. Been put on Esomeprazole and omeprazole over 10 seperate times.

Im 25 years old, in good physical health, obviously not counting the GI. And still, I feel like hell. I get chronic low grade fevers and will just randomly become so unbelievably weak and shaky and break out in a sweat. I’ve begged doctors for help, hoping someone would actually investigate. Instead, I get basic advice like, “Try eating bland foods” or “Have you tried cutting out spicy stuff?” as if I haven’t lived in this body trying to fix it every single second of every day.

They do bloodwork: normal.
They run basic tests: normal.
I fight to get an endoscopy and I’m already dreading the outcome because I know they’re going to say it’s “mild gastritis.” Great. I could have told you that.

That’s not a diagnosis. That’s just saying “your stomach hurts.” It doesn’t explain why I can’t sleep without feeling like I’m going to vomit, or why food sits in my gut like concrete, or why I feel this deep, constant discomfort in my core.

What’s worse is the emotional toll. I’m not just physically sick—this has wrecked my mental health. I feel completely disconnected from everything. I can’t even cry or talk to my mom about it anymore because I’ve hit a point where I feel like nothing matters. I’m not suicidal, but I have thoughts. Not because I want to die—just because I don’t want to experience this anymore. I dont even have any life goals anymore. 

If im not on PPIs the burning is unbearable and i have every symptom, but even when i am on PPIs, i still have the exact same symptoms, just minus the burning. I would even say my vomiting and nausea gets significantly worse with PPIs.

That’s where I’m at. I don’t even know what kind of post this is anymore—a rant, a cry for help, or just an attempt to feel less invisible.

If anyone has been in this kind of hell and actually gotten real answers—something beyond “take PPIs and hope for the best”—please let me know. Because I’ve got nothing left but this post.

I’m grinding at 15 which is on the coarser side of a 20 point espresso scale and a minimal dose of 14 grams of coffee. The issue is that this setup yields 61 grams of espresso (4.3x ratio) with a 45 second brew time. So lots of water and lots of brew time. If I try to solve for too much water by using a finer grind size, larger dose or additional tamping force, it only extends the brew time. And vice versa.

She worked late usually finishing around 9/10 at night, worked most of the weekend but usually had one of the 3 off. I however work Mon - Fri 7am-5pm. But I made it work and drove an hour every weekend to see her even if only for a few hours, mostly spent sleeping. Then the bar closed about a year in to us dating. She then got the opportunity to move a little closer to me and took it but didn't have a job. She said she was going to try get a Mon to Fri job so we could have our weekends together and for the few weeks she didn't have a job it was great having that together. I was even planning to move in with her and applied for jobs close to her. Then she got two job offers one was day shifts in a coffee shop mostly during the week as the weekend was usually college workers. The other was mostly weekends in a bar that was open til 2am. And offered less money.

She took the bar job and would get annoyed whenever id bring up the fact that I thought she wanted a Mon to Fri so we could have weekends together. Our time together was now only from like 10 am when she got up til 6pm when shed start work and the entire time she'd be tired from work. She'd just say she loved her job and it didn't feel like work. But here I am making a sacrifice and changing my job with friends I love to be with her. AITA?

Edit: just for context this is in Ireland where there's not a tipping culture, so she doesn't make tips in either. The coffee shop is 16 an hour 40 hours a week. The bar is 13.50 an hour and 24 hours a week",2,1750366175.0,AmItheAsshole,42,0.53,False

I've recently purchased a lattisimo one which takes the OL pods. Got some to try with the machine so I made a caramello with the maximum milk 165ml which was ok. I do prefer a bigger coffee so I brewed a second caramello as a lungo and added it to the single shot caramello with milk (mistake, was horrible) the double shot in hindsight would of been nice but im trying to make a nice big drink.

Then brewed two of the purple pods appregio i think they are called & added 200ml cold milk to try a iced coffee and this was quite nice to be honest. 

I hate the mug sized pods for the VL they taste what I'd imagine a ash tray to taste like.

I bought the new machine off a retailer that accepts returns upto 60 days... so basically need to try and find some OL recipes that I actually like. If you are a big milk/coffee drinker like me how do you make yours and what pods do you use?

Don't want this to be a waste of money and would rather return if I can't get the coffee to work for me.

I also got a OL this time so I can try and use cheaper pods and not be limited to ordering 50x pods every time I run out of coffee from nespresso (im in the uk) . Do you use any off brand pods to make big drinks ?

Habitual book-sniffer, poster child for introversion. Single, for those that care. My pic: [https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY](https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY)

I'm craving connection, fellow redditors. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up!

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.
* I love to read! I'm currently reading *The 48 Laws of Power*, and *Atomic Habits*. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain^(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.
* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.
* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley. I'm currently playing No Man's Sky and Coromon.
* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that. The Penthouse was *ridonkulous* but so good.
* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Tell me about you and what you're passionate about. I'm one of those people who loves hearing about what people are into. If I ask too many questions (it happens), I don't mean to interrogate. I'm just interested. :P

I'm not looking for anything romantic. If you're interested, flick me a chat request if possible. I'm also willing to move off reddit if we hit it off, if you so wish.",1,1750365730.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

I’ve never actually made a post before, I’m more of a Reddit stalker rather than poster. However, lately I’ve been going through a lot and I struggle with bpd (borderline) so sometimes I’m not sure whether it’s a valid crash out or not. 

For the last year, my best friend Lydia and I have been living together with her husband Luke (fake names ofc). When we moved in, Lydia found out she was pregnant so about half of our year lease she was unable to do certain things and I offered to help out. (Cat litter, heavy groceries/garbage etc) After helping out during her pregnancy I began to notice that Luke would ignore, or notice and not acknowledge certain things, such as cat litter (we have 4, all theirs), trash which would pile up within less than two days, and dishes which he would do occasionally if he needed something out of the sink, otherwise it would just pile up and sit in the sink for weeks. (I know this because I let it happen a few times and mentioned someone doing them until I got tired of looking at it and did them all myself)

To preface, I moved out of my parents house where I lived with 4 other people and the main reason I moved out with them was to avoid cleaning after others messes, and because I’d constantly get blamed for not cleaning even if I’d spent an hour reorganizing the bathroom or finishing dishes, it was never enough and it was a lot to take on mentally and physically. 

Now, I’m experiencing the exact same issues, almost to the same degree I had when I lived with those 4 people. Lately, for about 2-3 months, I’ve noticed that they’ve gotten more blatant about the disrespectful shit they used to do more subtlety. I’ll go shopping and spend about $100-$200 and then after unpacking they’ll say there’s no food, then continue to eat the food I bought, that I liked. They’ve gone grocery shopping maybe 2-3 times in the last 4 months because I’ve been doing most of the shopping when I can after work since i usually work mornings.

Lyd is always stressed with marriage issues, and being a new mother, not to mention her family members are a whole other story. I’m always offering to help out with laundry, and cleaning her room when I can. However, it’s almost as if she acts like I don’t do anything at all. She’s constantly making remarks about how she’s the only one who cleans, and the only one who plans, and the only one who’s packing, and painting, etc. Yet I’m the one doing damn near everything. I’ve painted our entire bathroom, kitchen, and half the living room, plus my own bedroom. I don’t have much stuff to pack so I’m damn near done, all I’ve been doing is buying the supplies so they can get their stuff out which I shouldn’t have done to begin with since this is their mess they’re in.

Now to the actual story. All day today, after I got off work I’ve been driving around getting stuff to help them finish packing to move. Earlier they asked me to go out to get them sweet teas from McDonald’s and since they asked me to go out to buy packing tape anyways I agreed. Long story short, they chugged theirs and then I got sent out to do another tape run cause we ran out (it was one half roll I stole from my moms house so I didn’t expect it to last long anyways.) This week has been a lot, we unfortunately had to say goodbye to our 19yo cat a few days ago, my mom’s been up my ass about money (I have none and neither does she now on the cc she gave me to use for gas and groceries), not to mention I’m moving into my aunts house and almost nothing is ready for my to move into over there cause I’ve been busy helping Lydia since Luke rarely does. When I came back from the store, I was genuinely looking forward to finishing my tea, painting, and packing more of our stuff up. Yet when I got home, all I saw was an empty cup by Luke. 

Now I will say, it’s not unusual for Luke to eat or drink something that’s not his. I’ve spent a year having to hide the food I really want from this man yet he somehow almost always finds it unless it’s actual food ingredients, then it magically is lost and needs to be found via search party (me or lyd taking one look in the pantry and finding it immediately). When I asked Luke if that was my sweet tea; he was playing with the baby pretending not to hear me, Lyd interrupted and said it was. When I looked at her with my usual wtf face (•-•), she continued, “I actually said he could have it cause you put it on the coffee table without a coaster and there was a water ring..”

Y’all…when I tell you those coasters don’t get used. I genuinely mean NOBODY here uses those fucking coasters. So my •_• face went to 🤨 real quick. I even said “dude, when was the last time you used those. All you do is wipe off the table..” 
(Lyd-) “except I’m the only one that ever cleans the table dude”
(Me-) 😶

She is not. Although I will say she cleans quite a bit, she’s always saying “nobody cleans like her standard of cleaning”..her standard of cleaning? Straightening up the living room, and doing 5+ loads of laundry from the clothes they leave lying around all over the apt. Then leaving out damn near everything that was used to clean in the first place. (Not relevant, I’m just heavily petty about that comment.)


After that I went into my room to finish painting and I’ve been writing this out thinking through our entire friendship this past year we’ve lived together. And all I’m noticing is the blatant disrespect towards me and how much it’s grown over time the more they’ve gotten comfortable with my kindness and generosity. I love helping out, I love being there for people, however when it gets to a point where everything I do doesn’t just go unnoticed but unappreciated and invaluable. I feel like I might as well not be helping the period. Were each moving with family so I’m hoping she sees how much I did over time, however considering how the past has gone, I highly doubt that would happen and I definitely know not to expect it from them. I want to tell her how I’m feeling, however we only have a week left around each other, and she’s already going through so much. However this is not the girl I’ve been friends with. This new girl is rude, and settles, and is one of the biggest hypocrites i now know. I don’t want to continue to build resentment towards my friend, but I know if I tell her she’s going to take it in the worst way possible and honestly might just cut me off if Luke decides he doesn’t like the way I hurt his wife’s feelings. 

Idk what to do, I feel like a dickhead, but also in my mind they’re the dickheads.

AITAH if I let this little thing(s) be my breaking point to my friendship of 10+ years.

Habitual book-sniffer, poster child for introversion. Single, for those that care. My pic: [https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY](https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY)

I'm craving connection, fellow redditors. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up!

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.
* I love to read! I'm currently reading *The 48 Laws of Power*, and *Atomic Habits*. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain^(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.
* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.
* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley. I'm currently playing No Man's Sky and Coromon.
* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that. The Penthouse was *ridonkulous* but so good.
* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Tell me about you and what you're passionate about. I'm one of those people who loves hearing about what people are into. If I ask too many questions (it happens), I don't mean to interrogate. I'm just interested. :P

I'm not looking for anything romantic. If you're interested, flick me a chat request if possible. I'm also willing to move off reddit if we hit it off, if you so wish.",1,1750365446.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1lfldhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrongerByScience/comments/1lfldhe/program_review_sbs_greg_nuckols_28_free_programs/,[Program Review] SBS Greg Nuckols' 28 Free Programs,"Wednesday June 18th, I just finished 1 cycle of Greg Nuckols’ 4 week program from his 28 free programs on the StrongerByScience website. Here are my thoughts on the program.

**Background**

22/M/5'11""/194bs. No athletic background outside of recreational basketball, hiking and biking when I was younger. I started lifting in a commercial gym my first semester of uni in fall 2022 and was fucking around for under a year doing mostly squats and deadlifts, and other machines that were free. I followed Candito’s 6 week linear program back in 2022 and made decent progress but didn’t follow it to the tee. I skipped some sets and didn’t do the accessories because I was lazy. Just before taking a hiatus from the gym, my 1RM at 190 for SBD were 225, 105, and 295 respectively. I wasn’t benching at all and I only did enough to maintain my strength/numbers. 

After around a year of no lifting, I got back in the summer of 2024. I was more consistent this time around and I definitely wanted to progress on my lifts. I went 4-5 times a week depending on my schedule with school. I made a huge leap in my numbers around October 2024. For about 2-3 weeks I was constantly trying to push my 1 rep max on both the squats and deadlifts. Sometime in November 2024, my 1 rep maxes were a sloppy 305 half squat and a 385 deadlift, though I never tested my bench since I didn’t like the movement. Though I started training them as my upper body was definitely lacking and ohh boy after finding the optimal and comfortable grip for me, I was hooked. At the start of the year, I was definitely training my bench more and was finally able to hit 135.

**Diet**

I didn’t track my food most of the time since I was eating out 2-3 times per week and I really only ate when I was hungry. Tracking my weight daily, though, was crucial since I didn’t want to gain more weight than I need to and I want to be more mobile for my hikes and I do eventually want to start running. If I weighed in a bit heavier than maintenance weight, I would just eat less that day in order to offset. 

My diet could’ve definitely been better though I made sure my pre and post workout meals were more on point. I ate whatever and didn’t really follow anything. My protein intake was definitely lacking as I only had around 100-120g of protein per day. Though, I made sure to eat a proper lunch, usually full of carbs, to prepare myself in the afternoon for the gym. Before every workout, I would eat a granola bar or two, or sometimes a banana and always a cup of coffee(\~100mg). After lifting, I would usually have my protein shake. 

**Program**

For this cycle, I ran the 2x beginner squat, 3x intermediate bench, and 2x intermediate deadlift in a 3 day weekly schedule. Without fail, I would squat and bench on Fridays, bench and dead on Mondays, and finally squat, bench, and deadlift on Wednesdays. 

This is the first powerlifting/strength program that I followed from start to finish. I skipped some accessories this time as well. I only did them if I had the energy and was not overfatigued. 

The programming had both sumo and conventional stance deadlifts for separate days. Though, I only stuck to conventional. 

**Results**

|Movement|Start PR(1RM)|End PR(1RM)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Squat|285|315|
|Bench|195|205|
|Deadlift|405|425|
|Total|885|945|

I tested all my PR on the last day. Same diet, maybe a little more caffeine. No belt, no lifting straps, no knee sleeves, no wrist wraps. Squat was smooth, ATG, grind at the top. Bench was also smooth and fast, though if I added 5lbs to that, I probably would’ve failed. Deadlift was a little struggle at the lockout, but the start was quick and easy. 

*Squat*

The first week was the hardest since I had to do multiple sets of 5s and 8s. My conditioning sucks as I previously only did triples and singles when I got into heavier weights. I tested my 8RM and decided to call it a day as I still had AMAP reps of bench and heavy sets of deads. Overall, challenging and good volume. The 8RM and 5RM were definitely a grind but I was used to lower reps and heavy loads so 3RM wasn’t too bad. Technique-wise, it was iffy at first but it dialed in the 2nd week when I finally decided to start bracing. 

*Bench*

I recovered pretty well with bench so I ran the 3x intermediate bench. I had to modify a lot of sets in the lighter weights due to time constraints. Overall, I will definitely run this as I like the volume and the AMAP sets.

*Deadlift*

It was going to improve either way. It definitely was the least challenging out of all the 3 lifts. I went off program and decided to do heavy triples, doubles, and a single at 90% on Week 3 Day 2. 

**Overall** 

It’s a very fun program to run and challenging. I felt good all throughout the program. My technique still needs a lot of work. Incorporating proper bracing should help my squat and deadlift more. Proper leg drive can help my bench as well. 

*Going Forward* 

I’ll be doing a deload week, or two, or three. I’m still unsure what my fitness goal is now. I do want to go into a cut and hopefully go from 195 to 175-185. I’ll definitely improve my conditioning for squats and deads are they are areas of weakness. I’ll definitely still stick with the same program as I think I could squeeze out more numbers.",5,1750365438.0,StrongerByScience,2,1.0,False

1lflazz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaundryFiles/comments/1lflazz/what_sorts_of_things_make_you_think_hmmm_thatd/,"What sorts of things make you think, ""Hmmm, that'd fit in the Laundry Files?""","For context, I just got my copies of the 2nd edition Laundry Files RPG and I've started a reread of the series. Since I'm actively brainstorming adventure ideas, I will occasionally come across something and find that it slots pretty neatly into the Laundry Files universe.

I first came across the Laundry Files while I was doing a PhD in Proof Theory in the UK. Needless to say, it hooked me pretty quickly, and Proof Theory is a field that feels like it would naturally lead to a lot of OCCINT recruits. What follows is some mathematical Deep Cuts, but i do have a more horror-inclined addition at the end.

**Incompleteness, Esoteric Logic and the Halting Problems:** The crux of proof theory sort of starts with Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems - the mathematical equivalent of Turing's Halting Problem. It limits what sort of theorems can be proved in a system based off of arithmetic. It also says that you can't prove the consistency of arithmetic using the methods of arithmetic alone. The proof is a weird, self-referential process that essentially gets arithmetic to make statements about itself like, ""This statement is true but unprovable"", which feels like a good stepping stone to using arithmetical proofs to start communicating with extradimensional intelligences. 

**Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you:** Later in life Gödel slowly starved to death, suffering from an intense paranoia in which he believed someone was trying to poison him. There's a reason K-Syndrome's full name is ""Krantzberg-Gödel Spongeform Encephalopathy"". Of course, Gödel became an American citizen, and died in New Jersey, so I wouldn't rule out the notion that the Black Chamber actually *was* out to get him in his later years.

  
**Cutting Close to the Turing Theorem:** There is actually a published workaround to the Incompleteness Theorems. In 1936, german mathematician Gerhard Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano Arithmetic, using a method called ""Transfinite Induction"" (""transfinite"" is one of my favourite words to throw into a Laundry context). It involves constructing an arithmetic of infinite numbers called the Ordinals, where you have some weird behaviours - for example (a+b) is not always equal to (b+a). Weird, infinitary arithmetic? Also feels very Laundry-esque. 

Now, since Transfinite Induction cannot be proven within Peano Arithmetic, this doesn't *actually* violate the Incompleteness Theorems... but it feels like it's getting very close to a Turing Theorem equivalent.

**Nazi OCCINT:** Gentzen eventually threw in with the Nazis, and worked on the V2 rocket project, before being arrested in the citizens uprising of 1945 and sent to a Soviet prison camp where he eventually died of starvation. I feel like there's something to be done with the Nazis having access to a mathematical equivalent to the Turing Theorem, but lacking a computational expression that would have let them unlock the field of Computational Demonology. 

**Modern Proof Theory as Honeypot:** Modern Ordinal Proof Theory is a relatively obscure field. When I finished my PhD, one of my invigilators said, ""You can probably count the number of people in the world who understand this level of Proof Theory on your fingers"". Ordinal Proof Theory largely takes the concepts Gentzen developed in his original proof - Sequent Calculus, Cut Elimination, and Proof Theoretic Ordinal Strength - and applies them to increasingly complex theories of mathematics, to prove those theories are consistent.

Looking at this through the lense of the Laundry Verse, the notion that there's only a handful of professional proof theorists in academia worldwide makes me think that 1) proof theory is probably a highly controlled field of research and 2) the handful of professors who actually teach proof theory are probably all plants by their country's OCCINT groups , as a honeypot for new recruits. Anyone who goes into that field is already toying dangerously close with discovering an equivalent of the Turing Theorem, but with the Gentzen Proof out in the wild, you need a way to catch people who stumble across it and want to know more.

Anyways, enough obscure mathematics. There was one non-mathematical thing that came across my feed recently, and immediately made me think, ""This could be horrifying.""

**What's the deal with Mushroom Coffee?:** Youtube coffee Guru James Hoffman recently made a video taste testing the recent fad of ""Mushroom Coffees"". Most of them are a mix of instant coffee, and various mushroom extracts, and purporting to have the usual vague and nebulous health benefits - enhanced brain function, lower blood pressure, antioxidants, etc. But as James read off the ingredients, there was one recurring element that jumped out at me - ""Cordyceps extract"".

Now, if you hang out on the internet (or you've played The Last of Us), you're probably familiar with Cordyceps as a parasitic fungus that turns its host into zombies. It's a real thing in nature - there are multiple species of cordyceps in the wild that infect insects of various varieties. The fungus then takes control of the insect, compels it to climb to an elevated position, and then wait to die, whereupon the fungus sprouts from the host and releases spores to continue its lifecycle.

So naturally, seeing ""Cordyceps extract"" in commercially available health products immediately made me think there's an exonomic mushroom colony somewhere that has found a very successful reproductive strategy by brainwashing crunchy-granola health nuts.

What about you guys? Any historical events you feel fit a little too well in the Laundry timeline? Results in math or computer science that will absolutely end up landscaping Wolverhampton? Myths that could be twisted to an eldritch end, or products that have gathered a bit too much of a cult-like following?

Very long post, trigger warning substance abuse (mentioned only as background information)

Me (F) and my partner (M) have been together for about 8 months now. Far from an ideal start to the relationship due to many circumstances on both our parts. Neither one of us lives alone. We both live with our families, and both are in our 30’s. We try and make it work.

A little background:

We have known each other for many many years as friends and reconnected last year. Went on a few sweet dates and he asked me out. I said yes.

 We both have rocky pasts that include substance abuse. Both of us have stopped using hard drugs. I now smoke weed and drink sometimes (both were approved by my substance counsellor). On weekends I would drink a 12 pack of beers or get a bit drunk which didn’t bother him. He rarely drinks and will sometimes have a few puffs of a joint. Our time together has been very limited, especially since I’m taking college courses on top of my full-time job and being what one can classify as a caretaker and translator for my parents, mostly my mother. Yes, we’re codependent I’m quite aware of that but that’s for a different thread lol. My last two courses were very easy for me (not bragging, it’s very relevant to the story) and barely required any of my free time except for attending the weekly 3hr class. I breezed through them. In my last class I was made aware that the next course (one I’m taking now) is demanding, 20+hrs of homework/studying every week…. Not counting class time. This will all be relevant later I promise.

He’s been super wonderful. He’s sweet, caring and thoughtful. Brings me flowers, and if in my area will drop by with a coffee. I get good morning beautiful text almost daily and sweet dreams texts too. He praises me for my hard work and the grades I get. Tells me ALL the time he cannot wait to spend the rest of his life with me. Tells me I’m an inspiration to him. Constantly tells me how wonderful I am and how special I make him feel. That he misses me. Says how wonderful I make him feel and how he wants to spend as much time with me as possible. Tells me I’m perfect and honestly just says the right things.

Let’s get to the point:

It all seemed like a fairy tale, until it didn’t.

A couple of months ago things started to feel different. After a Friday night date, we saw each other the next day Saturday. The following day (Sunday) texted me to say hi. He then disappeared for 3 almost 4 days. Zero contact from him. I said we’ve known each other for years so I also know some of his family. By day two his SIL messaged me asking if I’ve seen him.  She wanted him to call home as everyone is worried. I sent him a text saying to call his mom that she’s worried. He didn’t reply, but SIL messaged me about 30 minutes later saying he’s okay he called his mom. I got nothing. A day or two later I received a text from a number I didn’t recognize it was the BF. He said sorry he didn’t message me the day before (he was MIA for almost 4 days) said he got into it with his family and was just really sad and he broke his phone…. I told him that’s unacceptable to just go MIA because one is SAD. I mentioned his family was messaging me looking for him. I didn’t want to have this conversation via text especially since he was using someone’s phone. I said we’ll talk about this in person. At the time, I had just finished one of my easy courses and had 5 weeks before starting the HARD course. The first four weeks he made no attempt to make plans with me. Said he had an ear infection and wasn’t feeling well. I didn’t push it and used the time to catch up with some friends, and on some reading. Even though we had not seen each other we texted multiple times a day.

When I read in bed, I have a habit of just falling asleep… twice during the month we didn’t see each other I happened to knock out while reading. Now I don’t nap like normal people I fall asleep for 2-4 hours. BOTH times as I was “napping” he blew up my phone with texts. The second of the two times I work up from about 3hrs sleep to 8 “normal” messages just how his day went and what he’s up to…. The 9th message said “are you okay?”. Followed by a call a few minutes later which finally woke me up. It was about 6pm or so. Please recall he went MIA for almost 4 days. In all 4 days I had probably sent him a total of 8-10 messages as I was worried. This was the second time he went on a texting spree while I napped, and I addressed it as a bit of an issue he apologized, and we moved on. There were other little issues I had like whom he was hanging out with. We both have messy pasts, and he was hanging out with people who do hard drugs. Swore up and down he wasn’t doing drugs, he listened to my concerns and said he’ll stop seeing them. This included him spending nights at these people’s homes. I’m not judging them for their choices, but I didn’t understand why he’d spend nights there.

 

He finally found some time to come see me a week before I started by current class about beginning of May. In May when we met up he was about to start a new job… the 7th job in 6 months. I had enough stress and was just about to start school again so we had a talk…. We FINALLY addressed the MIA for a few days. He again apologized, claimed he didn’t know his family was looking for him EVEN though he called his mom within 30 minutes of me sending that text. So he obviously saw the message, phone showed it was delivered. There were also other things we finally had the opportunity to speak about in person. Like him spending nights at homes of people who are doing drugs, his 10+ messages if I don’t reply, his constant job changing. He made it clear that he wanted to stay with me and not break up. I explained that the next 14 weeks will be tough. I told him of the 20hrs of homework a week and that I’ll basically have no time for him. He said it was fine. He’s willing to wait because I’m worth it. We laid everything out. He promised this is his dream job, fine. He won’t hang with those people again, fine. He’ll respect that sometimes I cannot respond right away and will when I can, fine. I gave it another shot.

This class has turned out to be one of the hardest if not the hardest in my certification. I’m lucky if I only need 20hrs a week of study time. There’s a test every other weekend.

 

So this is where I know I started becoming the A-Hole

I knew my schedule was about to be full, so we made plans to meet that weekend as it was the first weekend after class started and there was no homework. He had to do something else last minute. Fine by me. Next weekend we made plans again and again he ended up changing them and not coming to see me. Again fine with me.

 

I stopped making plans because frankly I had too much homework and was tired of having him blow me off two weekends in a row.

It became an almost daily conversation with him asking when can I see you, me saying I don’t know. He responds with okay I understand. I’d feel guilty. He’d ask if we can spend the weekend, I’d say no I cannot take the whole weekend off from studying. He’d say okay I understand. I’d feel terrible. He again would say I just want to see my gf and spend some time with her, and I’d feel SO damn guilty about not having time. He wanted to see me on a weekend I had a test (my first test from this course) I felt so damn bad about not making the time that we made plans for weekend lunch. He agreed, but two days later he messaged me all excited his family will be out of town that weekend so I should come over. I said I CANNOT. So, we stuck to lunch. What I thought would have been an hour or so off from studying turned into 3 hours. It was a good lunch and he even bought be a just because gift. Got my birth month wrong and then told me I gave him the wrong month, when I doubled down on that he dropped the subject. I went home to do the test after that lunch and BARELY passed. I am NOT blaming him for that grade, but I realized then that I will need to study even more than I had been. He also himself said he’s been a distraction to me while I study when I mentioned the grade to him, so he said he’ll be more mindful of that.

The weekend his family was out of town he made it a POINT to tell me both days that he’s home alone. The second day he went as far as saying “I’m here all alone not a soul in sight and it feels so good” I didn’t know how to respond so said enjoy.

Let’s meet for the weekend conversation happened so many times with me always saying I cannot afford to take the weekend off from studying he finally said he surrenders and won’t ask again. It killed me to have him say he surrenders but I told him before I started the class that I won’t have the time to see him much he claimed to understand.  

Any time I’ve tried to rearrange my study schedule to see him he’ll be excited to see me but ends up having to do something else. That’s all fine with me, I get it, things come up. And I have always just accepted that he’s changed plans and used that time to study.  I have only been in class for 5 weeks. My weekdays are 9-5 work, come home study, walk the dog, watch an hour of TV and sleep. My weekends are groceries/ clean / help mom cook dinner and study, walk the dog and maybe watch a movie before bed. There have been days on the weekends where I sat in front of my computer from noon to 7pm. With bathroom and smoke breaks, I eat while I study if I eat at all. During these 5 weeks I lost count of how many times we’ve had the when can we meet conversation. I don’t know what each class week brings in terms of how much study I’ll need in advance. Sometimes I must redo the practice questions multiple times to make sure I get it (it’s a math based course).

I have cut down my alcohol intake recently, and he’s aware of that. Mostly cut down to manage weight. I have been very careful that drinking doesn’t become a problem for me.

Recently on a Friday while I was studying, he suggested I have some drinks to relax (WHILE I’M STUDYING). Another time I said to him that I just sat down to study and that I will chat with him later as apparently if I don’t say I’m studying he’s not aware of it and will keep texting and being a distraction to me. I thought that fair so I told him I’m studying and in turn am busy. He acknowledged that message. 30 minutes later he texts me a kiss. Sweet yes, but distracting. Up until that point I wasn’t turning my phone off to study, but since then I started to do so. When phone is off texts are obviously not coming though right away and it shows on his end as not delivered, last time he made some comment in a text while my phone was off about “if you even see the messages”. I obviously did when I turned my phone on. Asked him what he meant by that he said “oh nothing” I said “okay” to which he asked me if I was okay…. Wasn’t sure how to respond so I just said yup I’m fine just tired.

“I miss you” text which at first felt so sweet now seem like jabs at me not having time. They’re frequent enough and last time I just had it and said I only have two more months of school that he’ll be fine. Last night he said, “oh you forget to text me now”, no I didn’t I was studying. I don’t know how else to explain it to him without hurting feelings because I know he’s hurt that I have no time. He told me on many occasions that he thinks about me all day long, I joked that he needs to get a hobby to which he said that I am his hobby. I’m drained. I’m exhausted, my brain and body hurt. I sit in front of a computer sometimes for 12+hrs a day if you count both school and work hours. I’m so close to finishing this certification I can almost smell that piece of paper. I feel guilty for not having time / making more time. One minute I think I’m the worst GF in the world, and the next I just want to break up because I’m so overwhelmed. I get that he wants to spend time with me, I’d like to be able to spend time with him too. I will admit that most of my past relationships haven’t been the best, both parties involved had faults, but that makes me question if I’ve become so conditioned to those past relationships that I do not see a good one when in front of me, that I search for red flags that aren’t there. If you’re still reading thank you, you’re amazing for making it to the end. Please help a girl out. I’m often in tears when I have to say no, I’m sorry I won’t have time this weekend. Sometimes it even makes me want to vomit. I just don’t know what else to do how else to say it. Thank you for your time and any advice <3 I know this is all over the place I tried to be as detailed as possible without being too obvious in case anyone who knows us ends up reading this. Much love.

Eloise Langford’s first mistake wasn’t throwing the punch—it was not aiming for the jaw. 

“Langford, Principal’s office. *Now*.”

Eloise didn't flinch. Didn't bother giving them the satisfaction. She calmly wiped the blood off her knuckles with a crumpled Starbucks napkin she’d haphazardly stuffed in her pocket that morning and walked out of AP English as if she hadn't just clocked the school’s golden boy in the face. The classroom behind her hung in stunned silence before curdling into a quiet chorus of whispers. A hushed “psycho” here and there.  She didn’t turn. But the smirk tugging at her mouth was impossible to hide. The hallway stretched ahead, sterile and humming under flickering fluorescent lights. St. Agnes Prep already looked like a penitentiary for washed-up Harvard prospects and overpolished trust fund babies. In that moment, it shed even the false illusion of sophistication. The whitewashed brick, the framed photos of alumni who went on to buy their successes, the gold-accented school crest etched into every textbook, a futile attempt at manufactured prestige. Eloise had never belonged here and everyone knew it. She passed the trophy cases, the bulletin board with Ivy League acceptance letters pinned haphazardly onto it, past the rows of lockers lining the hallways, past the girl pretending to fix her hair whilst sneakily filming her. She knocked once on the principal’s door, letting herself in before a response sounded.	

Principal Yearling looked up from his desk, discontent radiating from behind his horn-rimmed glasses.She took her seat across him, knuckles raw and swelling beneath her cuff. Dried blood clung under one fingernail. Not hers, thankfully. “Miss Langford,"" he began, voice clipped. ""Would you like to explain what happened?"" He asked, eyes scanning a yellow legal pad before quickly adjusting it until it sat perfectly aligned with the edge of his desk.

She didn’t blink. “He called my aunt a washed-up drunk. I disagreed.”

Yearling looked up slowly. “By… fracturing his nose?”

“I thought I was being merciful. I could’ve gone for the throat.”

Across the table a loud gasp sounded, the guidance counselor Mrs. Feinstein looked up in horror before fumbling for her notepad,  probably scribbling *concerning aggression* in her faux leather notebook right next to whatever notes she made about her since freshman year. 

“This isn’t the first incident, Eloise,"" Feinstein commented using that tight-lipped, condescending voice that made Ellie want to rearrange her face instead. ""Aggression is a pattern with you. So is disregard for authority. Dare I remind you that last semester you were suspended for hacking into Mr. Dermott’s laptop to change your chemistry grade ""

“I prefer the term efficient studying,” Eloise remarked with a shrug.

Feinstein ignored her “And the time before that you skipped class for an entire week.”

“To research.”

“To stalk teachers using the NYPL archive computers,” Feinstein deadpanned.

Yearling cleared his throat, pulling the conversation back. ""Miss Langford, whatever your reasons, this is your third strike."" She knew. She’d known the second her knuckles collided with Cameron Blake’s perfectly moisturized face. St. Agnes didn't believe in grace, especially not for kids like her. The legacy kids could get away with vaping in the chapel or stealing the Dean’s parking pass. But not her. Never her. Eloise Langford, scholarship girl, the girl who punched Cameron Blake, the school’s debate captain, future Princeton admit, son of a board member, right in the face. She wasn’t granted the same latitude.This was strike three. And unlike baseball, St. Agnes didn’t believe in forgiveness. Or second chances. 

“You’re being expelled, Miss Langford. Effective immediately.” Yearling finally said, sliding a beige manilla folder across the desk.

Inside lay her transcripts, two write-ups, and a once glowing college recommendation letter to Columbia that would now be nearly as useful as it was ironic. Neatly tucked away at the bottom of the folder lay the disciplinary report. Eloise didn’t bother opening it. She knew exactly what it said. She’d read versions of it her whole life. Words like *volatile,* *disruptive,* *lacks discipline.* She stood, rolling her shoulders back, her posture more composed than any derelict child in trouble had any right to be. Just nodded and slung her bag over her shoulder like it didn’t hold the remains of her academic life. “Do I get to keep the uniform, or do I have to turn it in with the blood?”

Feinstein’s gasp could’ve shattered glass. 





Ellie barely made it to the front door before the shouting started.

""You want to tell me what happened this time?"" her aunt barked from the kitchen, still in her scrubs, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. The apartment smelled like burnt toast and her aunt’s industrial grade lemon-scented cleaning spray, an odd, oddly comforting combo. Eloise dumped her backpack by the door with a loud thud, not answering her right away.

""He insulted you,"" she finally muttered, tugging down the sleeves of her school issued collared blouse to hide the purple bruises already dotting her knuckles.

Her aunt appeared in the doorway, arms crossed, exhaustion and disbelief tugging at her face, ""So you broke his nose? That’s your defense? What happened to communicating like a normal person?""

Eloise leaned against the kitchen table, shrugging. ""Technically, I just rearranged it.""

""You’re not funny.""

She knew that. Didn’t mean she wasn’t trying. Anything to keep the conversation from turning nuclear.

Her aunt exhaled sharply and pressed her fingers to her temples like she could press the headache and disappointment out through sheer will. ""I work double shifts so you can go to that school. I put up with their snotty phone calls and fundraising guilt trips and pretend like we belong there, like we’re not the scholarship family with the problem child.""

Problem child. That one stung more than it should’ve.

""Ellie, I’ve done everything I can for you. But with this behavior? With an expulsion on your record? “You can kiss Columbia goodbye,” her aunt muttered, eyes locked on the road outside. “Or NYU for that matter. No scholarship board is touching a kid with an assault record.”

“But I guess I shouldn’t be surprised,” her aunt continued, voice tired. “Your mother never stayed in one place long either.”

There it was. 

The quiet gut-punch of her past, always slipped into the conversation like background noise. Her mother.

“I’m not her,” Eloise said, finally.

“You have her eyes.”

  


That night the walls felt tighter, wrapping around her, their embrace suffocating. She covered her ears with headphones in a futile attempt to block out the voices but even the white noise couldn’t smother reality. She thought about Columbia.  About NYU. About the list of dream schools she kept folded and hidden in her sock drawer, annotated with sticky notes, inked with ballpoint pen hearts. That was all in the past now, a part of her that never really existed. She didn't miss St. Agnes, that part was sure. Surrounded by crisp blazers and old money generational wealth. Encompassed by stuck up, prejudice bred children who would never need to work a day in their life. Being called names by teachers that would never understand what she was going through. *Charity case.  Trouble Child.* The administration let her stay as long as her GPA stayed high and her mouth stayed shut. Clearly, she failed one of those conditions.

She thought about her estranged mother. Not a lot. Not usually. But on nights like this one, the memory couldn't help but crawl in, seeping her brain with a haze that she couldn't quite shake off.  Her face wasn’t sharp anymore, just impressions, dark hair, warm hands, a voice that read bedtime stories in French. Stories that hung to the edges of her memory like fog. The grief came in strange pulses, never when she expected it. Like now. Sleep didn’t come that night. She watched the sun set between the slats of her blinds and felt the dread of what came next. Phone calls. Meetings. Futile attempts to fix something unfixable, something that even the kind of begging her aunt despised wouldn’t fix. She thought about her options. Maybe a last ditch application to community college? Maybe a summer job. Something, anything to avoid feeling stuck. She got up, paced her tiny bedroom, then sat on the floor and started to clean, anything to feel even the slightest bit in control. She sorted through her desk drawers, tossing old tests, folding half-finished sketches, organizing the heap of notebooks in the corner of her room. She found a photo of her and her aunt from when she first enrolled at St. Agnes, Ellie in an oversized blazer, her aunt with lipstick slightly smudged, both pretending that this was their shot at rewriting the Langford name into something respectable. Both of them smiled too hard, pretending like this was the start of something big. Maybe it had been. 

Around 3 a.m., she opened her laptop and started looking up GED programs and community college deadlines. A part of her still wanted something more, maybe journalism, maybe criminal psych. Something that made sense of the chaos. She even looked at a few out-of-state grants. But every site, every form, every hopeful click ended in the same wall: *disciplinary record*. At 5, she finally shut the screen and stared out her window at the bruised skyline.

Then she did what she always did when things got too loud.

She left.

The early morning air bit at her as she stepped outside, hoodie zipped tight.  Outside, New York was still New York, cracked sidewalks, cigarette smoke, the sound of a saxophone two streets down. The world spun on without her, people rushing to work, nurses leaving their night shifts, exhaustion etched on their faces. The sun hadn’t risen yet, but the bodega on the corner was open, the owner nodding at her like he always did. She bought the bitterest coffee she could find with a crumpled up fiver she found in her jeans pocket. Ellie walked without a plan, letting the rhythm of her sneakers scratching on pavement guide her, the city hushed, still smeared in pre dawn grey.  The world felt more honest when it was asleep.

She ended up at the New York Public Library. Again. Of course. Inside, it was empty. Still. The kind of quiet that only existed before the world woke up. It smelled like dust and time and the faint citrus scent of someone who cleaned before the doors opened. She bypassed the main floor, took the old staircase she liked best,  the one that creaked and always felt like it wasn’t supposed to be open to the public and found her beloved reading room. She dropped her backpack in her favorite seat, a corner table near the window  and opened a dusty book from the special collections archive. The type of book that looked loved, the pages dog-eared, the cracked leather spine and  the musty almond-like smell seeping through the pages, accompanying all antique books. It didn’t have a barcode, no ISBN either. The spine embossed with Latin in fading gold leaf that had long worn off. Bound in snakeskin-patterned green leather, worn soft with age. Inside, the pages were yellowed and water-stained,  warped from moisture, the text printed in long-dead languages. She flipped through absently. A faded drawing of a serpent eating its own tail. A coded message that looked like a cipher. A map that led to nowhere. Marginalia scribbled in red ink and what looked like charcoal. She turned page after page, more from instinct than curiosity.

Until she hit 213. The page felt… wrong. Too stiff, too smooth, a blank page that shouldn’t have been blank, thicker than the others. She ran her fingers along the edge and felt the faintest resistance, a slight life, as if one page had been pasted over another. Her heart kicked up. She touched the corner and felt a shift. Paper on paper. She peeled it back and there, tucked between pages 213 and 214, was an envelope. Thick, cream-colored. Sealed with black wax, stamped with a serpent. She turned it over. Her name was there. Not Ellie. Not Eloise Langford. 

But *Miss Elouise Vivianne Langford.*

Her full name. The one no one used. Not even her aunt. Her throat went dry. She didn’t open it. Not yet.She stared at it for a long time before slipping it into her bag and walking out.

We both have major sweet tooths, so dessert recs, bakeries, or cool ice cream shops are more than welcome.

We love Mexican food, from street tacos to upscale Mexican cuisine.

We’re honestly open to everything, brunch, hole in the wall gems, trendy restaurants, local favorites, etc.

We’re also open to driving a bit if you think it’s worth it!

1lfl3xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1lfl3xf/10_days_fecal_impaction_with_no_history_of_ibs/,10 days fecal impaction with no history of IBS - finally relieved,"Hi,

I have finally started feeling some relief from a 10-day long impaction and I thought I would give back to reddit because I found it useful to explore options and get consolation. I must have been on page 8 of google with site:reddit.com with every possible constipation term, and exhausted ChatGPT which gave me a lot of useful information but also false hope.

This will be a long-ish post but at the end I will write a TL;DR.

**Context**

26M in the UK: In my 26 years of life I have had no major health issues, no constipation, blood tests always came back fine, maybe inclined a little towards iron deficiency at some points but otherwise good. I live a mostly sedentary life but walk often and have a good amount of fruits, but a bit lacking in salad. Nonetheless, nothing to be a cause for concern.

**How it started**

I'll summarise: I was stupid. There is this thing that you use for diarrhoea relief back home. It is a very good medicine, it basically clumps the diarrhoea together so you get solid movements. It's called Entox and you get it from Pakistan. It contains attapulgite and it has always been useful. I took it on a vacation to Bahrain in case I needed it and I was fine. When I came back I left it on my desk. It tastes amazing, like a weird chalk but not chalk style. After I came back I would try it randomly even if I didn't need it. 

Until it bit me in the ass (and inside for the next 10 days). 

  
On the 8th June I ate pretty much only sunflower seeds (without the shell), and pringles. That's all I ate for most of the day. Just a bad off-day where I didn't feel like doing anything except gaming. After that I had some lamb chops and rice. Guess what I did after that. I had the medicine. Didn't think much of it.

Next day I start work (working from home) until lunch time I had to go to the bathroom. This is where I realised I messed up. This is where it gets graphic so you can skip the rest of the paragraph if you aren't interested in the shambles that was afterwards. This was the most excruciating stool I have had to pass in my entire life. This thing was massive and would only come out halfway and no matter how hard I pushed it would not budge. In the end I manually disimpacted it and what seemed to be the rest of it came out. Only it wasn't the rest of it. The rest of it was going to be the bane of my existence for the next 10 days. I went about my day as normal but felt uncomfortable like I had something blocking inside.

That was the most uncomfortable bathroom experience ever, I ended up showering for ages and ages and washed my hands until they turned wrinkled and then some. I realised as the day went on that I am constipated still from earlier, so I book an appointment with my GP the next day. I was given 30 sachets of macrogol (strigol) and was told ""I would be a new man in 3-4 days"". I took 4 sachets a day and was told to reduce it and stop if I got diarrhoea. Spoiler: the dose was not enough. 

**Self-medicating**

I was desperate enough to find a fix without going to the GP again and reddit was talking about enemas. It turns out that we don't have mineral enemas in the UK because of fecal leaking etc. etc. so I tried saline enema. I got it on same day delivery on Amazon and was so looking forward to be relieved. Again, it did not help at all. This thing was rock hard and quite high up. It did relieve some constipation but only such that everything went around the blockage. I did another 2 enemas on Friday and Sunday. None of them helped.

**Revisiting GP**

By the following Sunday (15th June) I was so bloated and extremely uncomfortable so I called 111 A&E and got an out-of-hours with my GP. I was told that the dose of 4 was not enough and I would need to have 8. So I did that. The bloating went but the actual root cause was still not gone. By this point I had tried some insane things like coffee with olive oil - the most disgusting thing I've ever drank btw, and still didn't help at all.

This Monday I tried 8 sachets. Nothing. False hope again from ChatGPT and it's not tiring from me firing a million questions at it. On Tuesday I kept it up and did 8 sachets again and this time had them all within 6 hours. This time the macrogol had even less effect than the previous day. I went and got myself a glycerol suppository and it didn't do very much either aside from cause me discomfort (I did not feel uncomfortable during any of the 3 enemas I did that week). I had burns from all of the macrogol and started to use sudocrem to ease some of it and rotated that with vaseline. It helped a little.

I decided on Wednesday (yesterday) that I would go to the A&E as this needs hospital-level escalation. I've never been to A&E in my life and let me tell you that the whole way through I kept saying ""I am paying £1500 tax every month towards this to still be treated like I'm a subhuman - WHY are we proud of the NHS?"" The initial people who saw me treated me like I'm a fool for coming over constipation, and I don't blame them because they probably get a lot of people coming in for constipation day 1 without even trying anything, people coming in over headaches without even letting time do its thing.

Until they saw the x-ray, they didn't really take me seriously. After getting scolded for poor diet, not enough water (when both of these things are fine) they realised that the problem was a bit deeper than that given that I have no medical history. The x-ray showed that I was pretty backed up and the guy kept saying something about ""dilated bowels"". It wasn't a GP so he seemed pretty clueless and even said ""I don't know what to do"". He ended up having to call some surgeons which was the most excruciating wait because I was feeling abdominal pain from not going all those hours. Finally I realised why we are proud of the NHS: the actual doctors are really good.

**The start of the relief**

Had a very nice lovely black doctor with the best accent ever call me to the side and tell me that we are going to try a phosphate enema. My pain went away at the thought because I had heard of phosphate enemas from reddit and ChatGPT and heard that this is the silver bullet pretty much. As weird as it was I was so excited for the phosphate enema knowing that it is likely to give me relief. After he administered it I was asked to hold it in. 11 hours of not going bathroom bloated my stomach badly. I went to the bathroom while he was gone as I couldn't wait, and exploded big time. I felt something move down which I guess was the big mass. It still didn't come out but I felt massive relief that I was finally in a good mood again. Doctor noticed that my stomach went in and was checking to see if I was fine. My mood was lifted but I was still a little worried that there was no solution. Until he said ""wait let's get some specialists"". We got some specialist doctors that asked what the issue was and that they had seen the x-rays and assured me that this was something that would not require surgery. They prescribed me three things. **Lactulose**, **prucalopride** and 3 phosphate enemas IN CASE I needed them, but encouraged me to not use them unless it got really bad. **This was the solution!** The lactulose in other reddit threads is treated as a ""weak laxative"" but actually it worked so well in combination with the prucalopride. Lactulose basically does what macrogol does and the prucalopride encourages bowel motility quite heavily. In conjunction, these guys pretty much broke down the main bulk of the big rock from 10 days ago.

I just finally passed it on the first day of having the medication, at least partially and I felt insane relief. It didn't come out at once, it had to be broken down pretty badly. I resisted the urge before then.

I am happy to be posting here and helping anyone in need in future who searches this up.

**TLDR:** I was an idiot and caused my own fecal impaction by having anti-diarrhoea medicine with bad diet, despite having no history of constipation and bad health in general. After nothing working including glycerol suppositories, 3 saline enemas, maximum-dose macrogol, I took hospital-strength phosphate enema + one day of **lactulose** and **prucalopride** which did the job for me on the first day. They told me it would take 2-3 days and it still might, but these two guys did the trick for me.",3,1750364770.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

1lfl3jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAKorean/comments/1lfl3jv/what_are_koreans_ideas_of_first_world_problems/,"What are Korean's Ideas of ""First World Problems?""","I have to give a talk in Korea, and I'm thinking of using 'first world problems' as an example to illustrate a point. ""First world problems"" are problems (feelings of being persecuted) only experienced in a developed society - problems that poorer people, or people in developing countries don't really face. They are things that people often get really upset about -- but in reality, it's just minor inconveniences...

Here are some examples of American First World Problems:

* The internet is slow today / down (and I have to go take a walk, read a book instead)
* The Coffee Shop is out of Moca and I had to have a black coffee instead
* My cookie is too big to fit in my glass of milk
* Moved the bus stop and I gotta walk an extra block...
* My phone doesn't fit in these pant pockets and I'm really upset!
* Having “nothing to wear” (despite a closet full of clothes)
* Samsung S25 comes out next week, but I just got upgraded to an S24...

Does the concept of ""First world problems"" exist in South Korea?

1lfl3bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1lfl3bp/review_vegan_in_northern_italy_extensive/,Review: Vegan in northern Italy (extensive),"Just came back from a 2 week trip in northern Italy. For context, this was my first time in Italy but my spouse is Italian (from the region) and we were primarily visiting friends & family, not spending as much time in tourist-heavy areas.

**Overall**: much better than expected. I was generally less optimistic about northern Italy due to heavier use of butter and meat vs the south where olive oil and veggies are more prominent. But, this was less of an issue than I thought it would be.

**Airlines (adding for those interested)**

* Planes
   * Flew Delta from LAX > Paris (and back). Both meals were curries and for airplane food, pretty good. I'll never understand why these catering companies don't give us bread, but rather crackers while the non-vegans all get vegan bread. ""Breakfast"" was pretty lame. Was served a bagel with jam and...a side of cream cheese (dairy based). But at least Delta has oat milk creamers now.
   * Flew Air France from Paris > Milan (and back). Short flights, but they passed out sandwiches which of course I could not eat and had nothing else. I had low expectations, and they were not exceeded.
* Lounges
   * LAX: Terrible, and I mean *terrible*. Essentially nothing to eat except *some* of the bread. Everything contained meat, dairy, eggs, or honey. Even the vegetables, somehow. No non-dairy milks for coffee/tea either.
   * CDG (2F): Largely the same as LAX. Still effectively nothing to eat except bread and the allergens were not listed and required scanning a QR code to open an absurdly long list of *possible* food items that *could* be out, but names didn't match and staff were entirely unhelpful. There may have been options, but god only knows. No non-dairy milks BUT they had little chocolates that were vegan, so I guess that was nice...
   * CDG (2E, M concourse): Shockingly much better. Like...they had plant-based burgers with pickled red cabbage slaw on them. It was that mushy vegetable-based patty, but whatever I'll take it. Of course, there was bread too. AND SOY MILK! Y'all have no idea how much I appreciate soy or oat milk in lounges. No desserts were vegan, but I've never encountered that ever in a lounge, so...
   * Milan (A01 Monteverdi): Exceeded expectations. Not only did they have soy milk (💪) but they had VEGAN PASTRIES for breakfast. I have never seen that before. Ever. Staff were otherwise unhelpful when the switch to lunch food happened. No allergens listed anywhere that I could reference. There was a vegetable couscous and caponata di verdure but there was no way to actually confirm what was in them, which was frustrating.

**General context for vegan food in Italy**

* ""Vegan"" is currently very strongly associated with ""healthy""
* Most vegan items in restaurants/bars/pasticcerias will have a slant towards whole grain, low sugar, fruit-based (as opposed to chocolate), vegetable-centric (as opposed to beans or other vegan proteins), etc
* There is much less of a focus on sauces/dressings or strong flavors like garlic or spicy condiments, largely absent from most restaurants

**VERY important preface**

* THERE IS VEGAN NUTELLA AVAILABLE IN NEARLY EVERY GROCERY STORE. LIKE, THE ACTUAL NUTELLA-BRAND.
* We carried around single-serving-sized jars that we filled with the vegan Nutella, pretty much everywhere we went.
* Fwiw, for specific meals out, I also carried small containers of an olive tapenade and calabrian peppers because...I need more flavor on things

**Grocery stores**

* We've covered the most important thing: Nutella
* There were also some *great* options if you want to go this route vs always eating out with my favorites being the cold cuts. Cold cuts (bresaola, carpaccio, prosciutto crudo, prosciutto cotto, salame, pollo) are very culturally important and there are vegan versions of many of them. Multiple brands too. This is what I'll miss the most back in the US.
* In Italy, it is (currently) illegal to call the vegan versions of traditionally dairy-based foods by the traditional name. So, you'll need to try your best to find the plant-based sections in the refrigerated and frozen sections and read ingredients to confirm. Irritating and I hope that changes.
* There are some great vegan brands, one which stands out is Valsoia. Look for this brand.
* Seitan rounds and smoked tofu are (for some reason) very common in larger grocery stores.
* Vegan gelato is pretty hard to find in grocery stores, but you will find vegan frozen novelties (none of which were particularly impressive to me, but I only tried a couple)
* Cookies are very popular, and a *few* have vegan versions. I enjoyed the Grisbì gianduia cookies. I do wish more brands made a vegan option though.
* Apart from a couple soft cheeses, there isn't nearly the selection of vegan cheeses we see in the US. I saw Violife in one or two stores, but the selection was limited. Even in health food stores, it was limited. The ones we tried though (Straccoveg stracchino, Goldessa herbed cream cheese, a vegan parm) were quite good - we used the stracchino in a risotto and it was divine.
* There seems to be more of a cultural desire for vegetable-based, breaded patties/balls of various kinds. You'll find these in almost all the grocery stores. I'm not a huge fan, but they're vegan!

**Breakfast in northern Italy**

* Apart from American tourist-heavy areas, virtually all breakfasts were at Bar/Caffès or Pasticcerias (when not eating at home)
* To my surprise, in a majority of places we stopped by (both in Milan/Como and the small villages in Veneto) had at least one vegan croissant option. Almost always jam filled and whole grain.
* These are often limited in quantity and will sell out if you don't go early. I'd suggest calling ahead, but depending on where you're calling, they may not know English...
* Also, the vast majority of these places have soy milk. Soy is not nearly as feared in Italy as in the US. BUT note that we did not typically find it in non-caffè type places. That is, restaurants/pizzerias which serve coffee after meals did not typically have non-dairy milk.

**Lunch/Dinner (restaurants) in northern Italy**

* Pretty similar to the US. I'd recommend doing research ahead of time to find places that are either fully vegan or have vegan options. Obviously easier in larger cities.
* In smaller towns, you're likely going to have two reliable options: pasta all'olio or pizza without cheese. Not bad, but if you're used to eating somewhat lighter fare in the states, this can get a little tough in terms of how heavy the meals are day after day.
* Vegetable heavy dishes are kinda hard to come by. Never order a dinner salad, you'll overpay for what I'm certain you'll be disappointed by.
* THAT ALL SAID, we found that restaurants were actually quite accommodating to me bringing them something to add to a dish. For example, twice I brought diced vegan pancetta to restaurants and asked them to pan fry it and add to the pasta and they were happy to.

**Desserts/Dolci in northern Italy**

* Admittedly, we overdid the gelato on this trip. I felt compelled to try every vegan gelato I could find at any gelateria.
* As noted, the majority of vegan flavors will be fruit and often sorbetto, not gelato. (I know, shocking.)
* But most of the larger gelaterias had a chocolate fondente option that was vegan. That appears to be the default non-fruit option.
* We were able to find several though that had additional flavors ranging from nocciola to stracciatella, pistacchio, brownie, crema, strawberry (not sorbetto, actual gelato) and more. I'll have to give it to my spouse...gelato is just better than American ice cream. These all blew me away. For the most part, the worst vegan gelato in an Italian gelateria beats the best vegan ice cream in America (imho)
* Outside of gelato though, don't expect to find much unless you're at a vegan restaurant OR you've picked something up from a pasticceria

**Amusement park (Gardaland)**

* Pretty similar to amusement parks in the US in that it's not stellar but you're not there for the food
* There was a plant-based burger at a couple of the dining places and it did the job. In fact, they had a plant-based mayo and cheese on it, so honestly, probably better than 90% of US amusement parks but I haven't been to enough to know for sure.

**Eating at home**

* Just a shout out to my mother in law who had never really cooked anything intentionally vegan before and she hit it out of the park. I was spoiled with vegan risottos, torta salata, pastas, veggie-based dishes, and more.",8,1750364726.0,vegan,1,0.91,False

There's absolutely no mess from the grounds exiting the chute, so I infer that the ionizer is working.

Back in 2017, when specialty coffee was still kinda niche and not everyone was raving about it, Mehul was out here, just making things happen. He practically kickstarted the first ever specialty coffee community in India. Before it was cool, before all the fancy cafes popped up, he was building it.

He started with a simple WhatsApp group, and it was wild how quickly it blew up. He managed to connect everyone: home brewers messing around with their AeroPresses, cafe owners trying to make a name for themselves, roasters, producers, even the folks selling coffee gear. Suddenly, you could just chat with a roaster directly or get actual advice from someone who knew their stuff. It was a game-changer.

And get this – he even hooked us up with discount codes from different roasters and equipment suppliers. My wallet (and my ever-growing coffee stash) sends its eternal thanks. 🙏

He wasn't just about the online chatter either. Mehul was out there doing free workshops! First in Bombay, then when he moved to Bangalore, and even hit up other cities. This guy was seriously on a mission to spread the coffee love.

Things kinda evolved after a while. The WhatsApp group got huge, so he moved everyone to Discord. For a bit, it was actually pretty cool. 

Honestly, Discord just got toxic after a bit. The anonymity meant people were just throwing personal attacks at everyone – fellow coffee lovers, roasters trying to build their businesses, creators just doing their thing. It turned into a total drama fest. So, Mehul, being the guy he is, just shut it down. And, no cap, it was for the best.

But you can't keep a good coffee person down! Mehul's back at it with a new WhatsApp group, still grinding (pun intended, sorry not sorry!) to keep building and nurturing this amazing community.

So, yeah, if you're sipping on some incredible Indian specialty coffee today, chances are Mehul's hustle played a huge part in making that possible. Mad respect to the man. ",0,1750364433.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.5,False

It seems that I wasn't the only one that didn't know what to do when faced with the evidence the recovery team had gathered.

""So..."" Nikonus started while looking over said data, ""Let me get this straight, based on *this* data and that chunk of metal the recovery team found, you think that the Venlil are hiding something that's serious enough to justify us interfering on their matters? And because of this suspicion of yours, you want me to authorize you to send a probe over that star system, *again,* to try and find more about it to *try* and confirm your suspicion?""

""Yes, that's correct, sir.""

""You do know that I can't just authorize you to send a probe there, do you?""

""I don't think you understand why I want to confirm this, sir. If we are to assemble an extermination fleet to try and get rid of humanity, should they be actually alive, then we must do it soon before it's too late.""

He sighed.

""Alright, let's entertain the thought that they're alive. Why do you think we should assemble an extermination fleet *right now*, further straining our forces that are currently fighting the Arxur, instead of dealing with it *later*?""

""Because I believe that our ships are obsolete against them.""

He frowned. ""Excuse me?""

""You hear that.""

""Why do you think they outgun us? Do you really think a species who hasn't even colonized other stars outside of their own has *anything* that can possibly have us outgunned?""

""I believe they *have* what it takes to pose a threat to us, *sir*, I was there when that weird ship that claimed to be under the Venlil fought the Arxur, *and I saw what it was capable of.* And let me tell you, as far as I know, no ship in the Federation has enough armor to be able to resist a direct hit from their main battery, their point defense system was able to protect that vessel from hundreds of missiles, torpedoes and railgun shells to a certain extent. That thing even took a hit from an anti capital ship torpedo from those flesh eating monsters and just *shrugged it off*! A*nd that was only a single ship.* What do you think's going to happen if we give them more time to make more of those?

If a single one can take on an entire fleet from the Arxur- which means it could easily do the same against a fleet of ours- then what could a dozen of them do together? A hundred? *A thousand?* The only way to take them down would be through overwhelming numbers, but as far as I can tell, it would take *at least* a hundred ships to take a single one of those behemoths down, and you know what's the worst part? Those things can *blink* through space, leaving no detectable traces behind!""

I was about to continue, but he interrupted me.

""If they are so hostile as you claim, then why haven't they wiped the Venlil out yet? Why did they save you and your fleet from that ambush?

You need to understand that as big as the Federation is, *Sovlin,* our resources aren't *infinite*, assembling large fleets takes a lot of time, resources and coordination, and if the humans really have gone as far as befriend the Venlil, get them to help them hide from us, *as you suspect they are doing*, then they surely already have access to the means of monitoring us, too.

Considering the scale of an Extermination Fleet, which can take *weeks* to assemble, such a large amount of movement would *definitely* not go unnoticed. I'm sure that they would see the assembly of such a fleet as a declaration of war.

I want, however, to try and solve things through diplomacy like *the civilized people we are*. Sure, the humans might be as savage as the Arxur, and might be threatening the Venlil to cooperate with them under the threat of extermination, but if the Venlil managed to get them to *listen*, then *perhaps* there's the possibility that diplomacy *could work*, and if we have the chance to spare our ships from a needless fight, when they would be better used against the Arxur. *Then I will try that*.

That is, however, *if, and only if* they are actually alive, I will get *someone* to do the job and check that star system, you don't need to worry, for now, let me handle your request, and if it really becomes apparent that the humans are alive, this will become a matter that I will need to take to the rest of the Federation board, thanks for warning me about their possible status.""

He stared at me for a few more *seconds*, before returning his attention to the screen of his holo pad.

I reluctantly flicked my ears. ""Alright sir, thanks for handling this for me, I will take my leave now.""

I left his office and started to make my way back to my personal ship, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of dread, after everything I've gone through in my *decades* of service to the Federation told me that a war inevitable, and it would be for the best for us to prepare for it.

*Perhaps I should try talking with Tyvil...*

============================================================

*Date \[standardized human time\]: March 3rd, 2130.*

***Memory Transcription Subject:*** ***Noah, UN Ambassador.***

Time was flying, literally.

In less than a week, more than a thousand changes were made to the protocols regarding the creation of AIs, the existing ones suffered extensive addition to their codings to prevent them from breaching protocol or, in the case of the ones aboard ships, make sure that they overrode control from their ships if the crew went rogue.

But that was far from being all of the changes.

Following the arrival of the Dreadnoughts back at the Solar System, they were immediately sent to receive new modifications and repairs, but considering their size, the Facilities that were in the process of manufacturing new ships had to stop working to tend to them, as a result, the UN decided to briefly seize control of the factories that were going to be handed over to the Venlil in order to cover the production of new ships and new facilities until the Dreadnoughts were able to move again, which would take at least a few more days.

Moreover, the UN was making good use of the maps that Tyvil had handed over to us, dozens of observation probes were in the making and would be sent to their own destinations by the end of the week to start gathering data on our potential enemies. If push came to shove, the data would allow humanity to conduct preemptive strikes much faster and deny them some of the advantages they would normally have. Hopefully, we would be able to avoid any fights through diplomacy

And that takes me to my current predicament, having to deal with the fallout of the incident involving the UND Minas Geraes and the amount of problems that her captain caused. Said man who *almost* got the electric chair, what his lawyer did to convince the judge of giving him a life sentence instead of a death one was nothing short of a miracle.

I sighed while looking at the mountain of paperwork I had yet to fill, Nikolai was also at the same predicament, as well as thousands of workers across the United Nations and its colonies.

Keeping all of those factories at the asteroid belts running 24/7 was causing a great amount of strain at everyone involved in their operation, be it the people who oversaw them working or those who manned the logistics.

The UN was aware that the current amount of factories wasn't enough to keep this work pace for long, and had already commissioned the construction of more facilities to distribute the workload, but while they didn't give the order to the facilities to resume normal operations, the amount of paperwork would continue to be the double of what it usually was.

*The UN seriously needs to automate paperwork...*

Thankfully or not, someone interrupted my work by knocking on the door of my office, I quickly unlocked the door and allowed them to enter, looking up, I saw Nikolai approaching my desk with a smile on his face.

""Weren't you supposed to be working?"" I asked nonchalantly.

""I was, indeed, but I've got good news, Armstrong asked me to inform you that he will be freeing you from your duties for the time being, he will be sending someone else to cover for you in the meantime until the new task he assigned to you arrives.""

""And what job would that be?""

""The Venlil will be sending a few of their boarding troops to Earth to train with our own boarding parties in a few days, and we will need to meet them and guide them the whole way until they get at the training grounds located near the base of the Space Elevator. I will take them from the docking ports to the base of the elevator, and you will guide them from there until the training grounds, a few hours of travel aboard the Maglevs, at most.""

""Doesn't sound too difficult.""

""Better than spending all day dealing with paperwork, ain't I right?""

""...Yea, I guess you could say that.""

Some moments passed, both of us staying silent and just kind off staring into each other.

""So..."" He started, ""how much time have you been here?""

""4 hours, I've probably signed more than a hundred pages as of now.""

""What about you come with me and take a break? You know, eat something and stuff.""

I raised my shoulders. ""Sure, I was finishing here anyway.""

I got up and caught up to him, we were in one of the administrative buildings that were around the Space Elevator, the constant horns of the [nuclear cargo ships](https://youtu.be/rTGL6TAvwcU) docking to unload their cargo to the Elevator and take products back to their respective countries was a constant reminder of why we were here.

The base was located in the Pacific Ocean, in the middle of the line of the equator, the position itself was strategic, the majority of the ships came from the US and China, major manufacturing countries, while coupling the base to the bottom of the ocean hadn't been easy, the result spoke for itself.

""So, how's the construction of the weapons and defenses around the Space Elevator going?"" I asked him.

BRICS+ and DCEG had started to invest heavily on fortifying and armouring the giant space tether, it was of the utmost importance to make sure it was heavily protected, because if the aliens inevitably made it to Earth, the Space Elevator would likely be their priority target, be it because of its scale or because of its importance.

Were that tether to snap, the cable would likely wrap itself around the planet and cause an incalculable amount of damage and deaths, the UN had estimated it would be in the hundreds of millions, with the potential for a lot more that would potentially come from more debris that would certainly split off in the atmosphere and many other consequences of such large structure impacting Earth.

Based on that, it was decided that the first major defense platforms would be installed near it and in geosynchronous orbits.

""Things are going well, the cost's getting a bit high since the Navies need to divert their personnel to operate the nuclear powered ships, but the higher ups know that it's still cheaper than the cost of the cleanup that we will need to deal with if that damn cable snaps, so they're fine with paying for it.""

""How much time until they finish the first step of the construction?"" I pondered.

""A few weeks at most, after that, they plan to start building more defense stations around the factories in the asteroid belts. The colonies on the Moon and Mars have also taken it upon themselves to start building their own defenses and fortifications. The construction of the bunkers around the US and Europe are going well too, I assume?""

""Yes, a bit costly, but automation has come a long way, so it isn't as expensive as it used to be, our economy will be a bit shaky after their completion, but with the deal with the Venlil in place, we should be able to recover pretty quickly, it also helps that the majority of those working on them know that their completion will be the difference between the life and death of hundreds of millions across the globe.""

""Same thing across the territories of the countries that compose BRICS+.""

Silence followed, a few minutes later we arrived at the cafeteria, which was busy as usual. The televisions across the room constantly displayed news from the construction efforts across Earth and its colonies. Nikolai and I picked up something to eat and sat with a few of our other friends. We spoke about a bunch of topics, specially about a rumour about an ambitious plan that the US had proposed in the last UN reunion: the construction of a [RKV](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html) as a preemptive strike weapon.

The plan was simple: Use Project Dyson to accelerate and power a vehicle equipped with a massive laser sail carrying a hyperdrive, and once it reached a significant fraction of the speed of light, have it enter hyperspace and exit it near the target, the aliens wouldn't even know what hit them.

Of course, such idea was quickly shot down by the General Assembly, with many of the members present even calling it a 'war crime', even though the Geneva Convention had yet to be updated to accomodate the newest developments on warfare.

But, of course, duty had to call and interrupt our peaceful talk.

My phone started ringing, and, surprisingly, Tarva was calling me, she wanted to meet with me via a video call to deal with some special matters involving the relationship of our species.

I excused myself from Nikolai and started walking back to my office, I told her I would call her back when I was back at my computer, thankfully, she didn't see it as a problem and quickly hung up the phone call.

*Perhaps Tyvil gave the go ahead to start the procedures for a small exchange program? I hope things unfold nicely...*
