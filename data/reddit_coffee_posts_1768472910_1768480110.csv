Please let me know whether I'm missing anything, or whether I'm doing too much (this does not include regular descaling, I'm just looking for every day procedures)

After each coffee (before I turn the machine off):

* empty the portafilter & run an empty double espresso shot
* wipe the steam wand and briefly run the wand 
* take out the bottom basket part, empty the water into the sink & briefly run water over the 3 parts, then leave to dry
* take out the portafilter basket and run water over it and the portafilter (sometimes I use dish soap to scrub them), then leave to dry

It feels like quite a bit of work to do this each time, so I'm kind of hoping not to have to (for example) take out the bottom part to empty the water every single time? Am I missing anything? I also sometimes put the end of the steam wand in lemon water for 15mins and ten scrub it. ",1,1768479955.0,baristaexpress,0,1.0,False

1qdi3x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1qdi3x5/i_guess_looks_do_matter_a_lot/,I guess looks do matter a lot,"Growing up, I was always in the camp of ""looks do matter but not as much as people give it credit for"", but, as I've grown older, I've realized that that's not true in a lot of cases. And there's been one such case in my life that really drove that home.

Throughout my adulthood, I've realized that, if you look young - especially for your age - then you can get away with dating people who are much younger than you.

For instance, I have a friend who was 32 years old when he'd started going out with his girlfriend who was 24 years old at the time. An 8-year gap, but my friend looked (and still does) like he was in his early/mid 20s, so people turned a blind eye.

Not that the age gap is wrong or anything. He was in his early 30s, and she was in her mid 20s, which is grown up enough in my books, so I wouldn't say anything about it, personally.

But the reason as to why I bring it up is because we had another friend who had a 7 year age gap - he was 31, and his girlfriend was also 24 - but he looked like he was 35 years old (forehead wrinkles, balding, crow's feet). For some reason, our friends were really against the relationship, saying that he was dating a girl who was too young for him.

Obviously, this threw the group into disarray because we had two couples who were pretty much in the same boat, but one was given the pass while the other wasn't, mostly due to the differences in their physical youths. And that wasn't my only case of having seen this type of treatment.

Relationship-related ageism really does seem to exist. Anecdotally, at least. And I've seen it across cultures. And this isn't just about romantic relationships. Older people who look young fit very well into an ecosystem with younger, more youthful people. But older people who look their age (or older) are given stares, are told to stay away/be careful, etc. It even sometimes happens with younger people who look old for their age.

idk, just a thought I had while I was sipping some coffee this morning.

You know that feeling of fear when you start school for the next grade or when you hear the sharp, skittering sound of a spider's legs on a hard floor right in front of you? It's that split second when your heart races and your breath catches. Or have you ever felt that kind of fear on the brink of death, and you're begging for your life? Have you maybe felt the same fear of getting caught, murder, for example? What about the kind of fear where you don't feel safe in your own home? I have felt all of these fears, and I have faced them willingly or unwillingly; it doesn’t matter. But this? This is terror that I am feeling: something different.

How are we going to overcome this one? My name, by the way. The one talking right now. I am Manny. I don't know how else to say it, but there's a part of me missing. It's like standing in front of a mirror and not recognizing the reflection, and my own name feels foreign at times, like a distant memory I can't quite grasp. I know who I am, don't get me wrong, but there's a gap between pieces of myself. I seem disconnected from my own identity, as if parts of me drift away when I'm not looking. Let me paint a picture of who I am, and then I'll dive into what's happening right now. I just turned nineteen, and I have some issues. It started last year. I used to keep an old, worn soccer ball in my room, one that had been with me through countless games as a kid. Holding it sometimes makes me feel grounded, recalling the boy who used to have so much certainty. However, I recently noticed it's not there anymore, like another fractured piece of my identity. I was hearing voices. Everyone hears voices. Yeah, but mine sometimes act out the thoughts made by such a voice. Act quickly, let me explain.

I was driving down the highway with a group of friends, our conversation buzzing and the speed comforting. Suddenly, a flash—a deer's wild eyes caught in my headlights. Instinct kicked in, I swerved, lost control. Gone. Then I snap back, racing nearly 100 miles per hour on the interstate, my friends yelling for me to stop. That incident triggered something, things just got worse from there. Myra, a name you will hear a lot, takes care of me. When I came to, Myra just acted like nothing happened. She took care of everything.

Anyways, Myra takes care of me, all of me, and right now I am messed up. When I talk about things being coherent, it’s like I take a step back, and suddenly I’m Amanda G. McCulkin. At nineteen, I try to keep life on track—college, friends, keeping clean, and showing up to all my classes. At least, I thought that was the case. Starting this diary isn’t just about maintaining notes; it’s about understanding myself as I go through this process. Sitting here in my dorm feels like the safest thing to do when I feel caught in between. It’s a moment to breathe, a pause in the chaos, just me and my journal, trying to piece it all together.

10 am 

Holy shit, this cannot be happening. I wish this laugh were recorded cause it needs to go down as the ‘Ah fuck’. It’s an excellent sound. Anyways, fuck, I have missed my third class in a row with Qaugmire. He was hard, but I had been doing so well with all of my work. I'm fucking impressive, actually. I worked so hard to get into that class, and now, poof, for something I couldn't control, something that wasn't my fault. Why? Why would I miss three classes in a row? What reason did I have to miss one of the biggest tests I will ever have? Holy shit, dude. Like what is happening to me. I need to chill and maybe make my schedule like Myra; she can help. I hope she can help. 

3:00 pm 

Since Myra has been around, everything is really normal today. Nothing crazy, no classes missed, all meals accounted for, everything up to now. I've got two more classes to get through, and then I plan to head back to my dorm. Despite the chaos, I'm finding a surprising calmness in the routine, a moment to catch my breath amidst the whirlwind. I have so much shit to do, and my schedule is busy. I need to go to my room and chill out for the rest of the night. Myra and I can study, and everything will be cool.

3:00 am 

Fuck. That’s all, just fuck. Things are getting weird, weird. Like it's 3 in the morning. Tell me why I am fully dressed and my shoes are muddy as fuck. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I have been. I don't know anything anymore. Myra was sleeping. I had gone to bed. I don't understand. I can't go to the doctor—just my parents. To have a blemish in the family name, how could I? Right to Whittaker is where they will put me. I can figure this out. 

8:00 am 

Someone at the school is dead, and I knew him. They are saying he did it to himself, a fentanyl overdose, just kept taking one after another as if the pills were candy. I can't believe it. He wouldn't do anything that had that in it, like he's a good kid. I don't know, it's just spine-tingling. The strangest thing is, the other day we were sitting at the old oak tree behind the library, laughing about how time seemed to slip by unnoticed whenever we were there. I can still hear his laugh, and every time the wind rustles through the leaves, it feels like he's right there, whispering that everything's okay. But now, under that same tree, I feel an emptiness that chills me to the bone. 

I sit at the base of the oak, taking in the quiet solitude. The leaves above rustle softly, a gentle reminder of the conversations we once shared. It's as if the world has hit pause, allowing me to soak in the sadness and the growing fear of what all this means. This stillness, however brief, weighs heavily on my heart, a moment where sorrow lingers before the chaos inevitably sweeps back in.

5:00 pm 

So far, so good. Today is going well, besides what happened. It's so sad to even talk about it, honestly. I can't say I understand because I have never felt like that before. I wonder what made that boy do it. What was so bad that was happening that he did that to himself? Why do people reach such a breaking point? I am going to bed at 8 tonight, and I am not and will not get out of bed for the rest of the night.

3:00am

Fuck. That’s all, just fuck. Things are getting weird, weird. Like it's 3 in the morning. I'm standing here, fully dressed, and my shoes are muddy as fuck. The weight of the dirt feels heavy, as if it's trying to pull me back to wherever I came from. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I have been, and I don't know anything anymore. Myra was sleeping. I had gone to bed. I don't understand. There's a wild pounding in my chest, each heartbeat echoing in the silence—loud and insistent, like a warning. It's like my body knows something my mind refuses to comprehend. I can't go to the doctor—just my parents. To have a blemish in the family name, how could I? Right to Whittaker is where they will put me. I can figure this out.

8:00 am 

I talked to Myra. She's going to stay up and watch me tonight to see what happens. She told me I'm not alone. I'm just scared right now. I'm afraid, and I don't understand what's happening. I know this has to be some mental illness, but I'm not a doctor, and I'm not going to try to diagnose myself. This could be several things anyway, and looking up symptoms online is just going to scare me more and make me even more confused. Myra is going to help me. I know I can count on her. But there's this inner battle raging in me about seeking real help. Part of me wants to reach out to campus counseling, to talk to someone professional. Yet, there's a heavy stigma attached to the idea of therapy that holds me back. Of all the fears swirling in my mind, the fear of how my parents might react feels the most acute. I worry they would see therapy as a sign of weakness, a mark against the family, a 'blemish' they couldn’t bear. It's like I'm stuck between protecting their perception and confronting what’s festering within me. Maybe I need to face this fear, just like Myra stays by me. Perhaps I owe it to myself to seek the support I need beyond what she can give.

11:00 am

I found drugs in my locker. I honestly barely use the locker, but today I thought I would check it to see if one of my books was in there. To my shock, the top shelf held a baggie filled with white powder capsules. They look like they were made and sold on the street. How could this have possibly ended up in my locker? The sight sent a jolt of panic through me. If campus security or the police find out, I could be expelled or even arrested. The thought that someone might have planted them there, and why, makes my head spin. Am I being set up? How many more questions am I going to have before I get answers? Every passing hour feels like a countdown to disaster unless I figure out how to deal with this ticking time bomb in my locker.

2:30 pm

They found another student dead today. It's another tragic ending for someone I never thought would harm themselves. I know it involved a tub and a razor blade. I heard there was a lot of blood. I knew Nick, too—a good guy, involved in both the chess and debate clubs, always seemed grounded. This moment feels disconnected from everything I thought I knew, as if the fabric of my reality is coming apart at the seams. What is happening in life right now, and why is everything around me spiraling out of control? As I try to process this, I notice a faint smell of bleach lingering on my clothes, an odd detail I can't explain. Was it there before? It feels like each tragedy is connected by an invisible thread, perhaps questioning how much of this chaos is beyond anyone's control or a reflection of some more profound, shared dilemma. Are we authors of our own fates, or are we trapped in a narrative we can't escape? I had a huge test today too, and I was so unfocused that I don't even know if I passed. I've been so tired, more than I feel I should be, like I haven't slept in days even though my clock said otherwise this morning. Please, Goddess of Earth, don't let anything worse happen.

9:00 pm 

I have stayed up a little late studying. Myra is up with a cup of coffee. She decided to spend the night keeping an eye on me and studying. I am so grateful for her. I am scared right now as I fall asleep. Why are these things only happening to me at night? Fuck, I hope I stay asleep tonight. 

8:00 am 

I woke to the unsettling sound of a rope creaking in the room's silence, and the faint, earthy scent of damp soil filled my nostrils. My palms seared with pain, and I realized they were marked with rope burns. My shoes were caked with mud, as though I had trudged through a forest overnight. This time, the scent was stronger, mixing with a whiff of something sharp, almost metallic, that tugged at my memory from previous wanderings. Myra said I drugged her. She explained she had merely gone to the bathroom, returned for more coffee, and suddenly collapsed against her desk. She recounted how I looked at her with an expression unrecognizable, like a stranger had taken over me. If I wasn't my fucking self, then who the fuck was I? I'm scared. Myra is scared. I don't know what to do now.

5:00 pm 

Officers were all over campus today, and I even saw some detectives. I don't think that these deaths have been what we all thought they were. I think someone is out there killing students. This time, it was this girl named Kiera. She hung herself in the back of the park in one of the trees. She had been there all night before she was found, is what I heard. All of this is really surreal, and I can't help but wonder if it has to do with me. Let's connect some dots really fast. Overdose: I discovered suspicious drugs in my locker. Slit wrists: I found myself covered in blood. A hung girl: I woke up with rope burns on my hands. It's as if my body remembers events that my mind can't process. Myra wants to go to someone, tell them what's going on, but I'm trapped in fear, tangled in threads that seem to tighten with every passing moment. I don't know what to do. I know I'm scared.

8:00 am 

I was out again last night. I was dressed and covered in mud when I woke up. Myra wasn't in the room this morning when I woke up either. I'm hoping she just went to class early. My exhaustion feels more than just tiredness; it's like every fiber of my being is weighed down, my eyelids rusted shut, my thoughts struggling through a thick, unyielding fog. I want this all to end. But maybe I need to try something different, something small to grasp at some control. Tonight, after classes, I’ll start with writing down everything I remember, every small detail, and maybe even check in with the residence advisor. Getting it out on paper might help me piece it together or at least show me a pattern, a glimmer of clarity in all this madness.

3:00 pm 

No sign of Myra. All day. A horrible feeling churns in my gut. Sick to my stomach. Can't stop throwing up. Nerves writhing inside me. Shaky. Twitchy. Feels like withdrawing from something. I cry uncontrollably. Who can I even talk to? Not the cops. Who won't go straight to them? I can't handle this.

When I have different samples (bass, melodies, drums etc.) loaded up, how do I *know* they ""play well"" together? What am I supposed to be listening for?

Some questions I have:

* **What makes a ""good mix""?** Is it just that everything is audible? That nothing is too loud or too quiet? That frequencies don't clash? How do you know when you're done?
* **Process order** \- Where do I even start? Set levels first, then EQ, then compression? Or EQ first to clean things up, then balance levels? Is there a ""correct"" order or does everyone have their own approach?
* **Frequency clashing** \- How do you identify when elements are fighting for the same frequency space? Do you just... hear it? Or do you follow rules like ""cut lows from everything except kick/bass""?
* **The learning curve** \- Is this something that just comes with experience, like wine or coffee tasting? Did you all go through a phase where you couldn't tell if your mix was good or terrible?

I feel like I'm working somewhat blind here - I can make beats that sound ""okay"" to me, but I have no reference point for what ""well-mixed"" actually means or sounds like. Sometimes I think something sounds great, then I listen on different speakers and it's completely different.

**For those who've been doing this for a while: How did you develop your ear for mixing? Any exercises, techniques, or any other best practices... ?**

Philip and Sonia's house smelled like a Starbucks all the time. Signs hung on the kitchen wall with funny expressions, like: *Coffee! Because Murder is Wrong*, and *Give Me the Coffee and No One Gets Hurt*.

Three cups before leaving home for work. One at lunch, one immediately after, still another two at supper. If Sonia prepared dessert, another cup to complement it. That had been Phillip's routine for years.
   
It was early morning; the sun hadn't yet peeked above the horizon. Philip sat at the kitchen table in the dark, sipping from his cup of freshly brewed goodness. There was a smile of contentment on his face.
   
Sonia couldn't sleep. She'd been up all night crying, but Philip didn't know that. He poured his second cup and breathed in its rich aroma as Sonia made her way downstairs and into the kitchen. She switched on the light. Her scream woke the neighbors.

Two months ago I got prescribed metformin for insulin resistance. I instantly started having side effects, but I was attributung them in part to that gastritis that I had. 

However, my stomach is fine now and my symptoms persist in what I only can guess are my intestines. 

I'm basically getting IBS-like symptoms. Lots of gas, diarrhea during the night 2 or 3 times a week and cramps during the nights when that happens. 

But the worst thing about all of this is the discomfort. Whenever I walk, bend, twist or turn I get this feeling like someone punched me in my belly (right around the bellybutton). It also overall feels like my guts became extremely sensitive and I have a lot of flatulence recently. 

I'm getting tired of this since I basically can't have any coffee (it makes it worse) and I'm going crazy because any time I walk it's either mild discomfort or outright feeling like some asshole grabbed my intestine and won't let go. 

I know metformin is associated with gut issues, but really? Sometimes I want to cry because it seems to go away, then I eat or drink something that my gut doesn't like and it's back again. It just feels never-ending. 

I'd really like to stay on metformin and I don't know what to do. 

Has anyone ran into something similar? Any advice?

​Most people wake up and crave caffeine. I woke up today and craved something much deeper.
​I walked into the kitchen, still half-asleep, and found Aarohi standing at the counter. She was wearing this thin, sleeveless silk top. the kind that barely has any structure. One strap had already given up and slid down her arm, revealing the soft, upper curve of her chest. She didn't bother fixing it. She just kept stirring the coffee, humming to herself.
​I didn't say 'Good morning' I just walked up behind her, wrapped my arms around her waist, and buried my face in the crook of her neck. She didn't flinch. She didn't pull away or act 'proper.' She just leaned back into me, letting the warmth of our bodies fuse together in the morning light.
​I didn't want the coffee she was making. I wanted the 'milk' that only she could provide. And since she had already left the door half-open with that falling strap... I didn't let the opportunity go to waste. 
​Later, we were sprawled out on the couch. I was resting my head on her lap, and I told her my theory. I told her that a Mother’s love should be unconditional, sure, but it should also be physical. I told her that a woman given to you by default in life should be the most beautiful, striking, and bold creature you ever see. There’s nothing 'wrong' with being attracted to the one person who is truly yours.

I'm also very curious to hear your stories if you'd like to share them! I find it a very interesting topic. And you suddenly realize that you're not alone with your experiences. Every one of us has encountered our shadow self. Even if it doesn't always seem that way.

My original elements are Air and Water. Both sides have always been very pronounced.

I was always considered hypersensitive. As a child, I cried a lot. I have many memories of it—out of fear, despair, but also anger. I spent most of my early years before school alone. A vast fantasy world with ""real"" people and action heroes was my constant companion; I had hardly any contact with real people. Therefore, I was very socially anxious and it took me a while to warm up.

On the other hand, I was also wild and very hyperactive. Always in movement and very talkative. This side of me caused me a lot of problems with the teachers when I was sent to school because I simply didn't fit in. I wasn't well-adjusted, too attentive to the wrong things. I was often sent out of the classroom, which always triggered intense feelings of shame. I received many punishments, even for things I hadn't done, because, after all, I was the bad guy. One teacher bullied me so badly that even the children in my class had to defend me.

Therefore, I chose the element of Air of the two, the carefree, cheerful, and active personality, because I found this side of myself difficult to suppress, and it triggered stronger feelings of shame. (I call my Inner Child “The Rainbow”, which also contains a bit of water, hehe, but it’s airy and light in the sky)

Fire might also have been an option, but I'm not strong-willed or assertive at all.

Choosing the element of Shadow was very difficult for me. What had happened was clear, but which element should I assign it to?

Thanks to the miraculous effects of coffee (I'd been drinking it since I was nine), I was able to concentrate better and, above all, control my behavior. I also invented a trick to distract myself from class (I would draw under the table) so that I wouldn't be mentally engaged and wouldn't say anything unprompted. This worked wonderfully (during puberty with all the new hormones, it became difficult again, but then I actually enjoyed being sent out of class).

First I was thinking about the element Earth to describe this transformation. My stillness, my immobility, like a stone or a mountain. It would be reflected in a calm style, without patterns or prints, with stiffer fabrics. Perhaps a few striking statements that maintained a distance from other people? But that wasn't what I actually did during my deep shadow phase. And I also felt that it wasn't helpful for me as a concept. When I think back to my teenage years, when my Shadow was the most active, I see more Water, a very emotional self. Even if I didn't show it through my actions, it was reflected in my clothing, my taste in music, and so on. It was all very emotional driven.

Perhaps my defense mechanism was more of a retreat into the depths of my own mind? A kind of non-existence. A muted perception of the outside world. Like an underwater effect.

I found that very fitting. Because the hyperactivity of my childhood hadn't disappeared; it had merely transformed. When I live my shadow, it doesn't expand outward like the element of air, but rather inward, invisible to the outside world.

And finally, my Sovereign self. I chose Earth and had to process that decision to grasp its significance for me. I wanted a logical connection between Air and Water. Between being too much and too little. A balance. My Sovereign type is still the most foreign to me, because even today I still fluctuate between extremes. But I increasingly understand how important it is to ground oneself in order to act autonomously and in harmony with the environment. I want to work on this grounding. In the here and now and the people around me. Or simply within myself and nature. But not in the all-consuming depths of the shadow, but awake and attentive. Watching others grow and accompanying them on their journey is one of my passions, which fits wonderfully with the concept of Earth.

Probs max 11 hours sleep over the past three weeks,"I thought I just had bad sleep anxiety as it took me hours to drift off but I would always manage to get 1 or 2 hours. When I started eventually getting zero hours and I was just a floating zombie I realised it might be more serious. So I joined this group and I was right. 

I went to the doctors and got some sleeping tablets and I bought a tonne of herbal medicine for sleep to try. I started off with the herbal stuff and at first it was working but then I became immune to it. I was really nervous to switch to the sleeping tablets so instead I used alcohol as a crunch. Very stupid and bad idea (I am now cutting that poison out of my life as I realised it most likely made my insomnia worse) 

So I moved onto the sleeping tablets - QuvivQ. I have heard good and bad things about this. I was taking them on and off. Mainly if I was desperately trying to nod off at 3am but apparently you are meant to take them every night like regular medication. So I did! I don’t believe in that deep breathing bollocks so this is what I did. 

I got a good bedtime routine. 

\- Nothing that will cause my brain to race over in the evenings aka nothing too intense on the TV. Switch the screens off an hour before bed. 

\- stay consist with the time you are going to bed. I wasn’t too bothered about a wake up time

\- my bedroom was nice and cool

\- dim lighting 

\- take the tablet 30 mins before I plan on getting into bed. During those 30 mins I would do my hygiene routine. 

\- leave phone out of sight (this was a major) 

\- once in bed read a book or just calmly sit and tell your mind it’s time to sleep. 

\- if I was really desperate I change the environment. Sleep in another room if you can or just ponder around for 10 mins to try and get your mind off not being able to sleep. 

And it worked for a while. I gradually stopped taking the tablets and just stuck to the routine. Then I moved places and the whole process started again - but worse. I have probably had 11 hours in the past three weeks. Some nights it just feels like I got a quick 10 mins. I started the tablets again and nothing changed. I worked out and went for long walks outside so the fresh air would hopefully make my sleepy later. And that’s hard to do in the winter with minimum daylight. I got so desperate I turned to the bottle again just so I could get my head down for the night and max I got was 2 hours which is odd as before when I used to drink it would 6-7. So never doing that again and also what a stupid idea but desperate times called for desperate measures. 

I don’t know if it’s change of environment, anxiety of another nightless sleep, the anxiety of waking up to a set alarm (even tho my stupid brain will decide it’s tired enough to fall asleep 20 mins before I have to get up). 

It’s really starting to affect my mood, my skin is terrible (I have eczema so sleep is vital for good skin). I don’t even like coffee and I am having to drink it just to function day to day. It’s making me feel so ill. Please any advice would be much appreciated ",2,1768479343.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

It begins with a sensation so mild it could easily be blamed on a passing truck, or one’s own imagination after too much coffee. Pets often notice a disturbance first, becoming instantly alert. Then floor gives a brief shudder. A lamp trembles. Perhaps a picture frame makes a soft clicking sound against the wall. There may be an accompanying rumble, or a loud sonic-boom type noise. Then the event is over almost before it begins, leaving behind confusion and a sudden need for validation.

“Did you feel that?” becomes the most important question in the room.

Phones are immediately consulted. Social media is checked with urgency. Someone mentions the USGS site, as though it were an oracle that might prove we have, indeed, felt something. There is a strange, quiet thrill in discovering that yes—there was an earthquake, and no—it was not just you. 

This excitement is always paired with an equally fervent hope that this is the end of it. We are delighted by the novelty, but not so delighted that we want a sequel. We want our earthquakes to be like cameos: brief, underwhelming, and gone before they can be confirmed.

Once assured that the quake was minor, harmless, and unlikely to be followed by anything larger, life resumes. The dog resumes his snooze. Lampshades and pictures on the wall are straightened. The house stands firm. 

But the story is told anyway, because feeling an earthquake—even a very small one—is still a story.

1qdhvtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Italia/comments/1qdhvtw/la_crema_dellespresso_è_una_cata_pazzesca/,La crema dell'espresso è una ca**ta pazzesca!,"Titolo provocatorio, lo so, ma era per attirare un po' d'attenzione. 

Siamo abituati ormai da anni ad esser bombardati da spot pubblicitari dove l'attore di turno, seduto sul terrazzo megagalattico assapora flemmaticamente un espresso decantando le lodi della sua crema. Il tutto ovviamente incorniciato dall'immancabile sfondo del Vesuvio.

Ora,  sapete che cos'è questa benedetta crema del caffè?



Smontandovi ogni mito sulla qualità del caffè, la crema non è altro che anidride carbonica. Ebbene sì, della bella CO2 intrappolata nel chicco e che viene sprigionata durante l'estrazione espresso. 



Il primo a coniare il termine crema del caffè è stato il signor Gaggia negli anni '40, che appunto ha osservato questo fenomeno dopo l'estrazione del caffè.

Da notare che sebbene il termine espresso fosse presente anche prima, in realtà denotava un caffè un po' diverso. 

Ciò che si è raggiunto alla fine degli anni '40 è l'estrazione del caffè espresso a 9 bar di pressione, tecnologia praticamente rimasta invariata fino ad oggi. Prima di allora l'espresso veniva estratto a pressioni di gran lunga inferiori.

La CO2 viene intrappolata nei chicchi durante il processo di tostatura (roasting in inglese) e poi rilasciata durante l'estrazione dell'espresso proprio grazie ai famosi 9 bar di pressione, che di fatto liberano la CO2 dal caffè macinato.

https://preview.redd.it/amjpwh778idg1.jpg?width=1114&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a2a2c09b176debea6efa6d6fc01504bd4fc0588

Due nozioni da tenere a mente   

Più i chicchi sono freschi, appena tostati, piu tenderanno a produrre crema. Questo perché la CO2 tende naturalmente ad andarsene nel tempo. Un po' come se i chicchi si ""sgasassero""

La varietà robusta di caffè è piu porosa e tende quindi ad immagazzinare piu CO2, col risultato di produrre piu crema. Questo viene utilizzato quotidianamente in molte miscele da bar e da caffè da supermercato proprio per questo motivo. In realtà però la varietà robusta, oltre a contenere molta più caffeina, è di gran lunga meno pregiata dell'arabica

Più un caffè è tostato e più CO2 ha immagazzinato e quindi lo sapete già.. tenderà a produrre più crema



Ora, una parentesi doverosa. 



Il caffè tostato all'italiana è molto nero, ovvero molto tostato.  A molti italiani piace ma dal punto di vista organolettico è veramente povero e amaro. Non dilungandomi troppo sull'argomento, in breve, l'Italia non ha mai avuto accesso a caffè di qualità come molti altri porti nordici come Amburgo e Rotterdam. Quindi per compensare tutti i difetti del caffè, di fatto veniva bruciato. Così facendo però molti sentori si appiattiscono. 



Un buon caffè non è amaro. Al contrario presenta una infinità di sentori. Per farvi una analogia con altri prodotti, il caffè viene degustato come fosse un vino o una birra o un whiskey di qualità. 



Il caffè come questi altri prodotti , ha la sua Taste Wheel che riepiloga tutti i sentori sia positivi che negativi.

Nel sub r/specialtyCoffeeItaly  parliamo di tante tecniche di estrazione e vi invito a farci un salto!



Nella ""terza ondata"" di esplorazione del caffe che è piu o meno iniziata circa 25 anni fa, ci si è concentrati sulla materia prima, sul metodo di processazione, quindi natural, washed, honey per poi arrivare a nuovi modi che includono anche lieviti, lievitazioni estese ed anaerobiche e chi piu ne ha piu ne metta.  Insomma si è riscoperta il chicco e sono comparsi numerosi bar specialty che servono appunto caffè di qualità. 



Nei caffè specialty non è raro sentire note di ananas o di pan di zenzero o di liquirizia.  Questo perché un processo di lavorazione e tostatura specializzati, permettono di estrarre davvero sapori unici. 

https://preview.redd.it/e46k22rb8idg1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=78e2b5b06b34ce100b4424cbb098811877c9f7b3

Parlo di caffè e non di espresso perché esistono una infinità di modi di estrarlo e la moka e l'espresso sono solo due.  In bar specialty va per la maggiore il V60 (drip) che è un metodo per filtrare il caffè senza pressione.  Con questa metodologia è possibile veramente riscoprire il caffé. Io personalmente non pensavo di poterci trovare sentori di frutta rossa, vaniglia ad esempio.

**2 AM.**  
You’re wide awake.  
You’re scrolling through quotes, watching motivational videos, writing down your dreams.  
You feel unstoppable. You’re going to wake up tomorrow and *finally* change your life.

**9 AM.**  
Alarm goes off.  
Coffee. Emails. To‑do list.  
That fire? Gone.

And you’re left wondering:

>

So here’s my question to you:

**What do you do to** ***capture*** **those 2 AM moments — before they disappear?**

* Do you write them down? Voice memo? Screenshot?
* Do you ever revisit them — or do they just… vanish?

 **How do you turn that** ***temporary*** **motivation into** ***sustainable*** **action?**

* Do you set reminders? Pair them with habits? Share them with someone?
* Or do you just wait for the next 2 AM spark?

I’ve been experimenting with a simple idea:

* Save your 2 AM insights (thoughts, goals, quotes, promises to yourself)
* Rate them the next day: “Still true? Still motivating?” → Yes / No
* Get reminded of them again in 3 days, 7 days, 30 days
* Track which ones you keep rating as “still true” — those become your *core motivations*

It’s not about forcing yourself to feel motivated — it’s about **curating what** ***actually*** **moves you**, so you can return to it — even at 9 AM.",1,1768478966.0,selfhelp,1,1.0,False

It turned out to be an AI bot for a first round interview for a job I had applied to about two weeks ago. The whole thing came without any warning whatsoever.

I was completely caught off guard. The bot started explaining the job description, but my brain was still booting up and I hadn't had my coffee yet. I decided to just go with it, but I knew I had already blown my chance. I was stammering, rambling, and my thoughts were all over the place. Definitely not one of my proudest moments.

So yeah, I'm sure I've completely blown this chance. I get that companies use AI for screening applicants, but calling someone for a surprise interview without any heads-up is a terrible practice.

1qdhooo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopForStudent/comments/1qdhooo/what_brand_of_laptop_is_best_for_students_heres/,What brand of laptop is best for students? here's what I actually saw after 4 years of college,"so I just graduated with my IT degree and I remember being SO stressed about this question before freshman year. I spent like 2 weeks reading reddit threads and watching youtube reviews and I still got it wrong lol

my first laptop was this asus vivobook I got for like $500 because I kept seeing ""asus is good value"" everywhere online. and honestly it was fine for the first year. took notes, watched lectures, did assignments. no complaints

then it started falling apart. the hinge got loose, the battery went from 6 hours to maybe 2, and it would overheat like crazy when I tried to run anything heavy. by the end of sophomore year I was done with it

I ended up getting a used thinkpad t480 from ebay for like $320. I was nervous because I never bought used electronics before but a bunch of people in my CS program had thinkpads and kept telling me they're built different. and yeah they were right. that thing survived coffee spills, getting dropped, running virtual machines for hours. still works fine and my younger brother is using it now

**so from what I personally saw on campus over 4 years:**

thinkpads were everywhere in technical majors. like half the CS and engineering students had them. most bought used because new ones are pricey but even the old models hold up. the keyboards are amazing too which matters when you're writing code or papers all day. downside is they're ugly and kinda chunky but honestly who cares

macbooks were huge with design students and anyone doing creative stuff. my roommate was a graphic design major and his macbook pro was basically his baby. the screen colors are accurate which matters for that kind of work I guess. also if you're already in the apple ecosystem with an iphone and ipad the integration is nice. but they're expensive to repair and if your major needs windows software you're gonna have a bad time. my buddy in mechanical engineering bought one and had to deal with bootcamp and parallels all semester. he was frustrated constantly

dell was hit or miss from what I saw. the xps line is really solid. knew a few people with those and they loved them. but the cheaper inspiron models seemed to have more problems. my friend's inspiron had wifi issues for like 3 months before she figured out it was a driver thing. not saying they're all bad but I saw more complaints about those than other brands

hp was similar. the spectre and envy lines seemed fine but the pavilion models felt cheap. my buddy had a pavilion and the trackpad started acting weird after a year. could just be bad luck but I heard similar stuff from other people

asus and acer are budget kings. if you're broke and just need something that works these will get you through. just don't expect them to last forever. my freshman year asus made it 2 years before it became unusable. my roommate's acer lasted about the same. they're fine for gen ed classes and basic stuff but if you're in a technical major you might outgrow them fast like I did

honestly the brand thing is kinda overrated. what matters more is the actual specs and build quality of the specific model you're getting. a $700 asus can be better than a $700 dell depending on which models you're comparing. I wish someone told me to focus less on the logo and more on what's actually inside

**few things I'd check before buying:**

look up what software your major requires. seriously do this first. if you need windows-only stuff don't get a mac. if you need to run VMs or heavy IDEs don't cheap out on ram and processor. I learned this the hard way

check your school's IT page. a lot of schools have recommended specs for each major. I didn't find ours until junior year and felt dumb because it would've helped a lot freshman year

ask students in your major what they use. I got way better advice from upperclassmen in my program than from any youtube review. they know exactly what you'll need to run and what actually holds up

if budget is tight look at used or refurbished business laptops. thinkpads, dell latitudes, hp elitebooks. these were made for corporate use so they're built to last and they're cheap on ebay because companies sell them in bulk when they upgrade. my $320 thinkpad outperformed my $500 asus in every way

so yeah there's no single ""best brand"" it really depends on your situation. but if I had to do it again I would've just gotten a used thinkpad from the start and saved myself $500 and a lot of headaches",1,1768478513.0,LaptopForStudent,0,1.0,False

*Previously: listener is an agent, specialised in breaking into other people's minds and taking over their body, using modern technology, invented by the government’s organisation they work for. One of their missions ends with failure: they got exposed and got on the nerves of one of the mobsters they were infiltrating. A few weeks later the mafia finally finds their true identity and uses them as a messenger, to propose a collaboration. Supervisors preventively gives “Picklock” a little pause, but a few weeks later they are back at work. On their next mission they meet the mobster again, which ends with getting a shot in the head.*

*(Coffee garden in the city, full of people, but rather peaceful. Picklock is sitting alone, drinking coffee)*

Oh, what a pleasant coincidence! Hello, Picklock, didn't expect to see you here. It's so nice to see you back. I mean, as yourself, in your own body.

Shh, shh, shh... Stop it, don't make a scene! People are watching!

Shameless? Me? Awww, thank you. Such a lovely compliment, I didn't expect it. Do you mind if I join you?

*(Sits anyway)*

Wow, that was harsh... You're lucky I'm forgiving. So, let's see the card. Can you suggest something?

Ok, let's try it. Waiter! One coffee degusto please!

Of course I knew you'd be here. It's the most obvious place to find you in your free time. 

Oh, don't act surprised. We know about your organisation as much as you know about ours.

No, I don't spy on you... personally. I have people for that kind of work. I just like to be updated. You know, in case I have to interfere or you'd desperately need help...

I can judge for myself if you need any help. I bet you don't know half of what's really going on. You are only informed about what is necessary, right?

*(Waiter brings coffee)*

Oh, there's coffee. That was quick, thank you!

Ok, let's see what you bought me today.

Of course you're paying, I was paying the last time, in the club.

It was your decision not to take advantage of the opportunity. An offer is still an offer. So, today's coffee is on you.

*(Tries coffee and immediately regrets this)*

Oh, God... Yuck! What's that?

It's the most disgusting coffee I've ever drank. Why did you suggest that?

Oh... Ha ha... Very funny. My bad, I shouldn't have trusted you. You broke my heart a little, you know? But I'm glad I was able to make you smile. You've brightened up that dark, dark moment... Ugh...

Now I understand why the waiter looked at me so suspiciously. Why do they even offer something so awful?

Weird tradition... Give me your coffee…

*(Takes Picklock’s coffee)*

Oh, don't whine, you'll get yourself another one. I just need to rinse my mouth.

*(Sips and rinse their mouth)*

Ummm, that one is actually good. Take one for me as well.

No, you're still paying.

Oh, yeah? Then watch this!

*(Drinks the awful coffee with one big sip, then again rinse their mouth with Picklock's coffee)*

Oh, God... I'm gonna puke... Or maybe not... My... That was... evil.

Because, darling, now we're even.

I killed you and you made me go through the worst coffee experience in my life. That's even.

*(With sarcasm)* Oh, you might be right. I shot you in the head. Quick, clean and painless death. Not to mention you didn't die at all. And you tricked me into drinking something that made my taste buds want to run away and never come back. My whole body almost turned itself inside out. I still feel it on my tongue and I'm terrified it will never come off. You're right, we're far from being even. You owe me... something. Nothing comes to my mind right now, but I'll think about it. Nonetheless... *(Casually)* What's up? I've heard you went on a date. With Charlie...

*(Disappointed)* Charlie? Are you serious? You can do better than that.

Be honest, you just did that to piss me off.

Jealous? I wouldn't say that. Rather a bit overprotective. He's not a guy for you. He's not a guy for anyone... He should stay alone until he learns some humility, respect and good manners.

Fun?! You have a weird definition of fun. Do you have some masochistic tendencies? Childhood trauma? Maybe you are just desperate?

Just friends, yeah, right... Whatever... Did you have any inconvenience after our last meeting?

Yes, I had, but not much. It was worth it. Not to mention my boss was delighted. 

And again, that look on your face. You just remembered who you are talking to, huh?

And how was... the experience? It was your first time?

I'm just curious. You know, I do it from time to time, it would be kind of fun to know how it looks from the other side.

You may pretend you didn't hear that, if it makes you feel so uncomfortable. But you experienced it first hand, literally. There is no point in pretending you don't know who I am and what I do for a living.

Did you just awake, as you thought it would be?

Like from a nightmare? You mean with your heart pounding like crazy, drops of sweat running down your body, shivering and panting heavily?

*(Dreamy)* Oh, I wish I could see you like that...

I said what I said. You can interpret it as you like.

Why are you blushing? Did you think about something naughty? Oh, Picklock... *(Suddenly screaming)* Watch out!

*(Two gunshots, then chaos: people running and screaming, stuff like that)*

*(A bit scared and in pain)* Are you ok?

Yes, you've been shot. But don't worry, the bullet went right through.

I'm sure, because it got stuck in my arm...

Stop whining... You're bleeding, but I'm sure it didn't damage nothing important, you'll be ok. If I wouldn't push you away you would now have a hole in your precious heart.

He's dead, I shot him.

*(Impatiently and in a rush)* Yes, in the head. What's the difference?! Let me think a little, it's not good...

We have a serious problem, because the man who just tried to kill you was one of my people. Do you understand what I'm saying? MY people.

You need to call an ambulance, but first, call your boss. Do you understand? It's very important. Call your boss and tell her that I said that something is wrong and we need to start now.

Just do what I say!

I'm going to see MY boss.

The wound is nothing, I've had much worse. Don't worry about me. Just deliver the message and take care of yourself. It's all you can do right now.

I really don't have time, I have to go... Stay safe, ok?

*(Softly)* Promise?

I just saved your life, you can do at least that!

*(Softly and hesitantly)* Uhm... Picklock... Just one more thing. Please focus, cause it's important. We might never again have an opportunity to talk. I know we had our ups and downs...

Yes, it was mostly ups for me and downs for you, but don't stick to the details. I want you to know that you were the best thing that happened to me in my whole adult life.

I'm dead serious. Maybe someday someone will explain everything to you. Or maybe it won't happen. But there's much more in this story that meets the eye. I have to go now. See ya, I hope…

**Trigger Warning**: Depictions of **Child Abuse** (Non-Sexual)

Lena had been more or less gawking at the stub where my ear used to be for the last hour while we waited in the living room for responses on the sigil. We started on the floor with a game of Yahtzee, then go fish with a pack of ratty cards I found in a drawer. But we found ourselves eventually on the couch, scrolling through seeing what we could find on our own. It wasn't much.

""Not like I have a complex about it or anything,"" I laughed.

""Sorry, she said, diverting her eyes. ""I just... how, dude?"".

""If I knew I don't think we'd be romping in the woods and asking strangers about the arts and crafts we found,"".

She chuckled, then we both went quiet.

""I don't know how this ends..."" Lena blurted out in a melancholy seriousness.

""I don't either, Lena. I don't either,"" I said back in a similar fashion. ""Something in my gut says not well,"".

""You can't think like that,"".

""How else am I supposed to? Whatever or whoever is doing this is following me and it's getting closer,"".

A ding from her phone sounded and interrupted us. Lena picked up her phone and we scrolled down a forum post we made to find the new response. Going through the previous responses which were a mish-mash of bump posts, people calling the symbol gay, people getting into an argument about the use of gay as a negative, and complete speculation on the actual subject. We prayed the new one was real. It was.

*Reply by - HouseOfAshAndBlood*

*I would like to say I'm some studied doctor with symbols and ancient history. But I'm not. I'm a third year at Uni studying the same subjects. Figured I'd be up front about it. Believe me or not, I guess.*

*Anyway, the only reason I'd be so bold to even try to answer this obscure post is because of what we're covering my lecture right now. Nordic/Celtic cultures, pre medieval. I thought I saw it flipping through a textbook in an all-nighter. Sure enough I've dug through again and it's in front of me.*

*That thing is what's referred to as a Binding Sigil. Used in these cultures magic practices such as Seidr, the sigil is considered obscure and taboo even in those circles. The function of the sigil is to represent and create a binding of souls between mortal worshippers and the worshipped. This was done for many reasons but usually as payment for a favor from a being, to pledge eternal servitude, or to acquire some of said being's inherent power.*

*The symbol can change in its look; the amount of barbed arrows in the lower half representing the pledgees and amount in the upper half representing those beings receiving the pledge. Suffice it to say making deals with the devil, quite literally, was not very accepted. While also being associated with blood magic and infamous, malignant covens, this brand of sigil was extremely looked down upon. Like a veiny dick drawn on a children's toilet stall wall.*

*That's all I really have for you. If you actually found this out and about then it's a rare find and I'd be curious as to who carved it. They know their stuff. Have fun sleuthing!*

So, we had some answers. It didn't blow the whole thing open but it gave us something.

""I don't like that,"" Lena said.

""Me neither,"" I echoed.

Another ding from her phone, we looked at the post below that just appeared.

*Reply by - ManOfYourDreams*

*Stop running. Come talk to me. You're doing nothing but making it worse. Nothing but feeding her. I've tried to help but you won't get it. Talk to me.*

""Is that-"" Lena started.

""Him. Yeah. I think so,"".

Lena closed her phone and tossed it away like it was infectious. She looked at me with concern.

""How does he know?"".

""Same way any of this is happening,"".

\* \* \*

Sixteen. I hated her to my bones. My marrow. And I think she felt similar about me and herself. The grift of free toys and favors died out a couple years ago in a fiery argument that ended with me procuring a limp for a few weeks. As I said before, whatever it was that she said possessed her still came alive in her eyes but increasingly it was just her. I felt I had turned her into what she was. She did too. In a way I hated myself for that.

It was a cool evening in the woods; the sun had already peaked below the treetops. I was in the living room playing around on my Xbox, snacks spilled all over the couch staining it. A jingle on the doorknob caused me to sneer with a delight I'm not proud of. I wiped it off with a chew of a chip. The front door opened and Mom walked in. She stopped in her tracks.

""You're not supposed to be here,"" she criticized.

""Yeah, I figured I'd take the day off from school. I got a lot done,"" I said through the same chip.

""I can see that,"" she threw back, looking at the mess I had made. ""Why do you think you can just get away with this?"".

""I've been asking that question about you all my life, Isabelle. You go first,"".

She stomped with a huff, slammed the door behind her, and made her way to the front of me with her arms crossed. I looked into her eyes. Still her.

""Go to your room,"".

I didn't waste my breath with a response.

""Did you hear me?"".

Didn't respond again, so she whipped her hand down and knocked the controller out of my hands. I sighed and without giving her the satisfaction of a glare I leaned down, picked the controller up, and un-paused the game and kept playing. It's funny how the simplest things can change the course of everything. Me picking up that controller, by and by, ended my relationship with her.

Mom reached out and grabbed me by the hair and yanked me up. With an automatic response by body jerked to it's feet and I let out a yell and dropped the controller again. It broke into pieces by my feet as she led me towards the stairs. I gripped my hands over hers with a pained rage trying to pry her off. A few feet from the first step I managed to rip her off of me and toss her hands aside. Unconsciously I stepped back from her and put up my hands in defense.

""You little shit!"" she yelled, breathing heavy with each pump of her chest. As she slowly walked towards me I stepped back.

""No, Mom. You don't get to hurt me anymore,"" I spoke with my best bravery, although I'm sure it came out with a shiver.

""Come here,"".

""No,"".

""Come here, now!"".

""No!"".

Her and I circled each other in stalemate; I could feel the adrenaline, fury, and fear in my arteries bursting to exit out of my heart. She darted for me and with strength I didn't know I had I pushed her away. She clattered to the floor with a bruising thud. She looked up at me with shock, I looked down at her with the same. I felt like a cornered animal, and so I did what a cornered animal would. I lashed out and then I ran.

As I sprinted towards the door and grabbed the knob I heard her clamber back to her feet behind me. I ripped open the door and ran out as it smashed into the wall and left a circular hole in the drywall. Making it to the cement landing outside I felt a pressure around my ankle right before my face contacted said cement. My legs kicked and flared as I felt the blood pool out of my nose, Mom's grip wouldn't free.

Turning to see her as she dragged me towards the door her eyes had shifted to that malignant 'other side'. My arms flailed and grabbed onto whatever they could to keep me in place. At one point in the flurry of action I remember getting a hold of the large, red pot filled with black dahlias. It didn't hold back my mother's onslaught, instead it fell and cracked itself over my head causing blood to drip from my scalp down my face. In a daze from the hit, I must've allowed my mother to grab me up by the collar and walk me inside again. It's all blurry, especially after the hit over the head, so I apologize if I'm being unclear.

We were moving through the house; my legs shuffling and bumping and smashing against obstacles told me we were going up the stairs. Finally my head halfway fixed itself when we entered my room. I came to the realization that my mother had me up against the wall, her one hand pinning me in place on my chest and my closet to the right of me. I had seen her in many states but in that moment she was her most bewildering; most animalistic.

""W-why?"" I choked out through the pressure on my chest.

""Why what?!"" she spat.

""W-why do y-you hate me?"".

Tears dripped down my cheeks between my gasps of breath. She wanted nothing with me, then to hurt me, then to feel pitied, then back again. Kids at school wouldn't talk to me, teachers would see my bruises and chalk it up to something not in their pay grade. In that moment I wasn't even hurt in fact I'd call it numb. Numb to a parent's love, numb to the world, numb to myself. I was utterly alone.

She saw me in the state I was in and it seemed as though for maybe the first time she could see exactly what she'd become. Her eyes widened, her lip trembled, her grip relaxed.

""My god..."" she gasped. ""Son, help,"".

Her neck snapped her head back so she was staring into the ceiling, her grip tightened harder than before. She let out a guttural and low groaning noise that whistled through her lower throat. With a painful pace she re-aligned her head to face me. She wasn't there anymore as she raised her unused hand towards my face. Her finger dipped into the blood dripping from my head and painted a straight line down to my chin. Her mouth opened crooked.

""M I N E ... BO THM I N E,"".

She took another dip of the finger into my blood but kept it there. Her finger pressed harder and harder into my forehead and screamed in pain. Her touch felt as though it was rending the skin from bone wherever she contacted.

""Please! Please, stop! Stop! Mom!"" I begged.

At my last shout the pressure stopped but her finger stayed in it's place. She was fighting again; her presence back behind the driver's seat. Her limbs, especially the arm that pinned me, began shaking with abrupt violence.

I looked to my right and hanging open still was my closet. It was a unique, or rather lazy, design that even as a kid I thought was strange. it had a lock. On the outside. I knew it wouldn't last but it would give me enough time.

I grabbed her by the shoulders and was caught off guard by how rigid and yet pliable she was. With a swift shove I threw her into the closet, slammed it shut, and clicked the lock while my whole body weight pressed into the door.

It didn't move an inch. The whole room in fact filled with a dead air; a void of presence. I leaned back, letting some of my weight off the door in anticipation. A chill started to ache in my joints from the air in the room.

""M-Mom?"" I dared.

Stillness.

""Mo-,"".

The door bashed into me with a violent burst. It hadn't broken but it succeeded in pushing me back a near ten feet. I watched it bend and crack again with another angry bash. Then another. Then a cacophony of bangs, scratches, yips and wretches from her echoed out from the door. It was as thought some great god had picked up the closet with her inside and shook it. Like every square inch of her was battering every square inch of space. That's the last I ever heard of my mother: her screaming for help as I ran out of the house. To this day I don't know if I was justified or just a coward.

I was on the streets for a few days, scrounging together whatever pocket money I had for bus passes. Had to hitchhike once; nice lady. When I got across the state and arrived at my grandparents, the address I still remembered from when I was young, I was starving and admittedly a bit smelly. Walking up to their door I remembered I used to wonder why Mom has us move so far away. Did she know what she was doing then?

My grandparents couldn't believe it when they opened their door; I thought my grandfather's jaw would unhinge it was so wide. They ushered me in immediately, cleaned and fed me, and gave me a thorough interrogation. We broke halfway through so I could get proper sleep but, in the morning, we picked up where we left off. This was the time they informed me about all my mother's past and what little they knew of me after she dragged me off into the woods abruptly when I was three. Both cried more than once. I had developed my trouble crying by this point; and anyone who has that trouble can tell you that people crying around you makes you feel even worse that you can't.

I had been coming back from using the bathroom and was in the hall back to the living room when I heard bickering. The two were arguing in hushed tones about something. Too tired and too fed up with life for subtlety, I stepped out into the room. They snapped back to a leisurely lounge at my sight and plastered smiles back on.

""If there's something to say I'd prefer there wasn't any secrets between us,"" I stated up front. ""I've had enough of living in the dark,"".

The two looked at each other and then back at me. I think we all took a collective breath.

""She didn't want us to tell you, but we think you should know,"" my grandma said.

""Your Mom had problems for, what we believe, a myriad of reasons. But this thing... it hurt her..."" finished grandpa.

""What? What thing?"" I asked.

Large pause. They took each other's hand.

""You had a brother,"" grandpa blurted out. ""He died. In childbirth. With you. A twin,"".

""The umbilical cord - it - well... it was terrible..."" grandma added.

The news hit me hard. A brother? Why wouldn't she tell me? Not all of it, my childhood I mean, but at least some of it now made sense. She was grieving. Grieving for someone who could have been. Someone, maybe, she thought I took away.

I decided to stay with them until I got my GED, I didn't want to move schools in fear she would track me down. The two elders understood my hesitancy and helped me study and gave me a roof over my head. But when it was all said and done, I couldn't stay. As much love as they tried to give me when you spend your childhood feeling unwanted it's hard to shake that feeling for anyone. I left them with an apology letter and the small stack of cash they gave me to start college lying on the kitchen table. I was 19.

Took a few weeks to wander but I eventually ended up where this all started. Couldn't hold down a job for more than a year; in fact I was going to leave the grocery before Lena showed up and kept me steady. I had always hoped I'd see my grandparents one more time, give them a proper goodbye. And apology. Something they deserved.

\* \* \*

My arms almost collapsed as I caught the bag Lena tossed across the drive way.

""What'd you pack this with, rocks?"" I exclaimed.

""Nah, bricks. There's plenty of loose ones in the house,"" Lena giggled.

Rolling my eyes I tossed the heavy pack into the back seat of my car and slammed the door shut. Lena, taking one last look at the house, then came to me and we leaned on the car for a bit.

""House taken care of?"" Lena asked.

""Lawyer has a buyer. Some young and eager flippers,"" I said.

""Oh, I'm sure this place will make a great hipster coffee house, or a microbrewery with three options that all taste like sewer water,"".

We both laughed. Silence followed.

""You sure you we should do this?"".

""Talking to him? Yeah. We've run out of options,"" I said.

""Can we trust him? Where do we find him?"".

""Most definitely not, and I have no clue. But I think he can tell, somehow, how to find me,"".

Lena got another ding from her phone from our previous post. She held it up with a questionable look, I gave her a nod. She opened the phone and scrolled down. Her face turned sour. Then scared.

""What?"" I asked.

""Look,"" she said, shoving the phone into my hands.

*Reply by - ManOfYourDreams*

*I cannot get to you. I know what I said earlier but do not, I repeat, do not get in that car.*

One more post came in immediately after, calling ManOfYourDreams a gay LARPer. Well, gay wasn't the term but we won't go into that.

""Do we trust him now?"" Lena said hesitantly.

""I don't know,"" I admitted.

""Well you said before to not to,"".

We sat in stalemate with our invisible, possible adversary and stared at the car. I gave a sigh.

""Get in,"" I said, circling over to the driver side door.

""You sure?"" she asked.

""No, but I'm sick of being scared. Don't know what's coming but I'm not waiting around for it anymore,"".

We packed into our respective seats, I heard the gravel fly and hit the trees around as I peeled out. I meant what I said, truly. But if you would've put a stethoscope to my chest then you would've called me a liar. My heart almost seized with fright but my courage and quite frankly my frustration won.

It was night. Trickles of rain pattered the windshield warning of a coming downpour. Lena was asleep so my fingers once again were rapping on the wheel to keep me steady.

I imagined what would happen, what I'd do, when Dream Man and I had our confrontation. Would I go for his throat? Would he go for mine? Could it all be as simple as a talk? My mind raced faster than the car. At one point through this process I saw Lena's arm move. Turning my head to welcome her back to the land of the living, I was not greeted by Lena.

Her hands, where not covered in cuts and bruises, were varicose veined. The whole skin was free of blood, wrinkled, and sagging like a used up rubber band. Her hair was half gone; flakes of patchy skin replacing it and the hair that was there was wiry and sapped of color. The mouth was curled into an unnatural grimace and the gums around the teeth receded, almost showing the root of the tooth. Wrapped around this horror was a gown of white stained black with old, matted soil. Her arms sat crisscross upon her sunken chest. The person, or rather the body next to me, was my mother.

In the next moment an unnaturally cold caress slithered across my Adam's apple. I couldn't move once I felt it, stiff like the grave. My eyes darted to the rear-view mirror and there she was, the witch; her hand around my throat, pinning me to the seat. Her gaze pierced into me and my insides turned to putty. Her other arm outstretched and laid her hand gently upon my mother's shoulder. My mother's eyelids shot open at the touch, her mouth stretched like the first time she ever hurt me. The same voice projected and the little boy inside me sobbed and shook at the tone.

""B O TH ... M I N E,"" the witch spoke through my mother. ""N O T H E R,"".

Lena. Was she hurting her while I was gone in whatever hell the witch dragged me to?! Before I could process the thought I felt a voice, not my own, rise out of my chest and burst through my clenched teeth.

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" I shouted, Lena's voice protruding in blood curdling tone.

I fought to peel my hands from the wheel, I wanted to seize the witch's hand a rip her from me. The more I pulled the more it stabbed and her grip on me tightened with every attempt.

""WAKE UP! OH MY GOD!"" the voice rose from me again.

""HELP ME!"" my mother shouted, her own decayed voice this time.

The sound of a truck horn pierced the air around us and burst in my eardrums. Both of us, my mother and I with Lena's scream, yelled out with the horn in a dull drone. My sight went black. I heard crushing, twisting metal. The hammer of great forces slamming into the earth. The drip drap of pouring liquids into steel basins.

My eyes unfurled. Barely visible through the haze inside my head. Smell of burning rubber and plastic. Oil. The car is upside down. Blood rushing to brain. I'm upside down. A small fire burns in the hood of the car a few feet away from my face. The heat singes my eyebrows through the broken windshield. I turn my head to see Lena dangling with me, her arms limp over her head and resting on shattered glass.

""Le-Lena?"" I rasped weakly.

She didn't move. Didn't speak. Nothing.

""Le-,"" I tried again before blacking out completely.

The sound of sirens in the distance was the last thing I heard. What came next in that inky void was a vision. A peak into the past, but not my own.

\* \* \*

She sat, knees in her arms, shivering. Her fingernails were split and cracked, gobs of blood dripped down to the floor from them. The walls, the door, even the brick around her were scratched and gouged and broken. Every joint and muscle ached and sapped any energy she hoped to use to escape. She cried.

A dark presence filled the air, one she had been familiar with after all these years. She didn't have to turn her head to know sitting beside her was the witch; the one who entered her and dragged her away to the deepest centers of her own soul to watch helplessly.

""He's gone,"" Belle said in defeat.

The witch said nothing, did nothing. She only looked over her most favorite toy as if to wonder how to play with it next.

""I want to be done,"" Belle said through tears. ""You can have whatever you want,"".

The witch, without word, projected exactly what she wanted into Belle's head. As if before Belle thought it she already knew. Her body. Her life. Her power. The witch outstretched a hand and within was an unfurled, yellow parchment.

""I need to leave him something. Please, allow me that after what you've done all these years,"".

The witch agreed. Belle leaned in and whispered something in the beast's ear which made her mouth curl in disgusting glee at Belle's suffering. When she was done Belle leaned back and, taking one of her bloody fingers, made her mark on the page. With the stroke she felt all her tortured life flee from her body and with a sad smile laid down to the ground and never moved again. The witch scanned her a long time with her decrepit eyes and when she stood up to leave: it was in the body of Belle she left in. No more fight. No more struggle. She was hers.

Per David Leibovitz's recipe, he calls for 375ml “brewed espresso (or very strong brewed coffee)”. I purchased a 6-cup Bialetti Moka Pot on his advice, and found out I needed to make two whole pots to get enough.

So, my questions now are: is it worth buying a larger pot to make enough coffee at once, or, taste-wise, is it ok for the coffee to sit long enough for me to make a second pot? 

Will that few minutes degrade the flavor of the coffee? 

Also, will a larger Moka Pot make the same quality coffee as the 6-cup?

(I also bought an AeroPress and a Phin to play around with, and see how the ice cream fares with those methods, but I have a feeling the Moka Pot will be the way to go. )",2,1768478090.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

Three spunky super-kids from the 2970s travel back in time to save teenage Clark Kent from Brainiac's nefarious plan to kill young Superman with farm equipment on the latest episode of Superman TAS! Join us as we discuss...

* Another Marvel trailer, the price of Black Panther comics and why we might be done with Star Trek!
* The origin of Clark Kent's glasses being just as dumb as learning as the origin of Han Solo's name!
* Trying to find some love for Superboy and being disappointed at his erasure from this continuity!
* Is Brainiac hot? Sonia lets us know what she really thinks!

 I've always been a picky eater. I can't eat any meat at all, and I also can't eat vegetables except for garlic powder if that counts. Can't eat nuts, beans, seeds, that kind of stuff. 

And here's some stuff that I'm not sure relates to ARFID or not but I've never used a stove or oven, and will only eat something if it takes under 3 minutes to prepare unless if someone else makes it for me. I'm a HUGE fan of cheese and will often spend hundreds of dollars on it and eat blocks of it by itself. Most days I eat Mac and cheese. 

When confronted with foods I can't eat, it's not like I have a panic attack or anything, I just don't eat them. If a vegetable is put next to a food I'm trying to eat I just throw it away, I don't get too upset or anything. I don't like these foods because they taste bad and make me gag, not to mention I can kind of sense the bad vibes off of food, if that makes sense. Even with foods I do like, I'll often leave a few bites because something feels off about certain parts.

For more context, I'm 22, 5'2"" and 80 lbs, but I've also never heard any doctor bring up ARFID so I'm not too sure. I don't have any body image issues, and I also don't really lose/gain weight safe for going up or down with the same 5 pounds. I also had a nutritionist and a few gym trainers who have also never brought it up. I also do NOT have autism, and I know there's a big link there. In fact, I don't suffer from any other mental health conditions either (unless I do in fact have ARFID).

I'd really like to hear opinions from people who actually do have ARFID, mostly for the purpose of explaining it to myself and others. People get upset with me when they cook for me and I don't eat it, or when I go out and don't order/eat/finish. I've been called privileged/spoiled my whole life because of my picky eating so to tell the truth I'm kind of hoping I have a good excuse, because I know I'm not going to change.",1,1768477588.0,ARFID,0,0.67,False

I joined an online mothers group associated with my babies due date and the country I live in. The platform, FB, offered community chats via its messenger system for all community pages. I joined the one associated with my due date group. It was great and able to ask questions. When the community chats got shut down a number of mothers decided to start a new unmonitored chat….. I was pulled into this new group.

Things were going well and after some postpartum issues I decided to organise a meet up with the few mums near me in this group. I felt it went well. We got on so organised another.

During this time the main group became sour for me as for reasons I couldn’t understand, anytime I needed support or wanted to show positives of being a mother I was mercilessly attacked by some mums who were like ‘ringleaders’

One of the mums that lives local to me (25F) seemed to notice and became a good friend and someone to lean when the other mums attacked me for any number of parenting choices- like feeding, sleep, self care, day care, meals, return to work- everything I did they had me feel like a terrible mother, and this friend. We would have coffees and play dates for our older children

I ended up leaving the main but she stayed and as I left she started to be the main target for these ‘high school bully’ attacks from grown women

Fast forward to this week and this mother had had enough of the attacked and ddciddd to say something, I was added to a small facebook chat of other mums from the original group and told to prepare as they had been talking and had all been attacked by the bully women….. I won’t even call them mothers they were vile.

Anyway in the original chat my friend calked out the bullies however they had retaliation prepared. Turns out my friend was originally part of a group that set out to disgustingly bully those of us they perceived as ‘not normal’… my only crime really being the oldest mum in the group by far

I found out that prior to meeting this mother in our first meet up she had been equally as critical in their side chat and during the first meetup was tasked to do things like take photos of me while sharing them to the side chat and saying horrible things

She was extremely remorseful and I am fairly sure I have seen her good side in all the meetups we have had and also been given proof after she saw I was a good person she stopped conversing in those chats but….. how do I get past that?

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

Here are a few techniques that will help.  
  
**But first, let’s talk about the hard truth.**  
You are taking ACCA because you ultimately want to hold a top-level position. Otherwise, why the suffering?  
  
As a manager, you will face stress regularly:  
⏱ deadlines, KPIs  
👮‍♀️pressure from stakeholders  
🧩decisions made with imperfect information  
  
So today is not just the day before exam results day. Today is a training day.  
Today, you practise stress management.  
  
What can help right now?  
**#1 Avoid student forums today.**  
Anxious people feed each other’s worst thoughts.  
Xbox or gym will bring you much more value than them.  
  
**#2 Run the worst-case scenario deliberately.**  
Ask yourself: What if I fail? How bad is it really? What would I do next? (Retake? Yes. Lose a promotion? Maybe. Career over? No.)  
Your brain relaxes once it sees an exit.  
  
**#3 Use the Five-Finger Technique.**  
It helped many of my students to:  
🧘‍♀️calm their nervous system during the exam  
🏹focus on the text instead of panicking during exam preparation  
👊survive disturbing news from around the world  
Everyone who wants to lead should master this skill.  
  
**#4 Assume a new identity**  
“I’m a future CFO. I can manage stress, so I won’t fall into self-destructive thinking.”  
  
**#5 Take an A4 sheet of paper and plan**  
What will I do if I fail? Retake one exam or take an extra one? Get a tutor? If so, who? What will I do if I pass? Which exam should I take next? Skip a session or sit it in 1.5 months? Self-study, tuition, or a private tutor? How many hours will I study on weekdays and weekends?  
If you have a plan, your result is just one step in it.  
  
**#6 VAK technique**  
Widely used to help people after severe stress (e.g. a car accident).  
👁V – Visual. What do I see?  
(I see a cup on my desk. Laundry I need to fold. Snow falling.)  
🎧A – Auditory. What do I hear?  
(I hear my neighbour’s dog barking, my breath, the gentle noise of my laptop fan.)  
🖐🏿K – Kinesthetic. What do I feel?  
(I feel how firm the floor is under my feet. How rough it is. How smooth my teeth feel when I touch them with my tongue.)  
👃I also expand it with S – Smell.  
I can smell coffee from my mug. My husband’s perfume from when we hugged before he left for work.  
  
Are there any techniques that help you?

A heavy, tarnished copper band with engravings that looked less like art and more like a warning. When I slipped it onto my wrist, the world didn't change—I did. I watched my hand vanish, then my arm, until I was looking at a void where my body used to be.
​At first, it felt like a superpower. The possibilities were intoxicating. I didn't think about the ethics; I thought about our mounting debts and the life my wife, Sarah, deserved.
​The heist was easier than I imagined. Walking into the vault was like passing through a ghost's dream. I walked out with a duffel bag stuffed with cash, feeling like the king of the world. But when I got home, the celebration ended.
​I reached for the clasp of the bracelet. It wouldn't budge. It felt like it had fused with my bone, becoming a part of my anatomy. I pulled until my skin bled, but I remained a phantom.
​Sarah came home to a mountain of cash on the kitchen table and an empty house. I stood right in front of her, screaming her name, grabbing her shoulders—but my hands passed through her like a breeze, and my voice was nothing more than a hum in the air she couldn't recognize.
​She cried for weeks. She thought I had robbed the bank and abandoned her, leaving the money as a parting gift for a life of crime on the run.
​I stayed. I became the ""ghost"" of our home. I would nudge the coffee mug she forgot, fix the drafty window, and tuck the blanket around her while she slept. I lived in the spaces between her breaths, a silent guardian watching the woman I loved slowly move on from the memory of me.

A heavy, tarnished copper band with engravings that looked less like art and more like a warning. When I slipped it onto my wrist, the world didn't change—I did. I watched my hand vanish, then my arm, until I was looking at a void where my body used to be.
​At first, it felt like a superpower. The possibilities were intoxicating. I didn't think about the ethics; I thought about our mounting debts and the life my wife, Sarah, deserved.
​The heist was easier than I imagined. Walking into the vault was like passing through a ghost's dream. I walked out with a duffel bag stuffed with cash, feeling like the king of the world. But when I got home, the celebration ended.
​I reached for the clasp of the bracelet. It wouldn't budge. It felt like it had fused with my bone, becoming a part of my anatomy. I pulled until my skin bled, but I remained a phantom.
​Sarah came home to a mountain of cash on the kitchen table and an empty house. I stood right in front of her, screaming her name, grabbing her shoulders—but my hands passed through her like a breeze, and my voice was nothing more than a hum in the air she couldn't recognize.
​She cried for weeks. She thought I had robbed the bank and abandoned her, leaving the money as a parting gift for a life of crime on the run.
​I stayed. I became the ""ghost"" of our home. I would nudge the coffee mug she forgot, fix the drafty window, and tuck the blanket around her while she slept. I lived in the spaces between her breaths, a silent guardian watching the woman I loved slowly move on from the memory of me.

Inspired by nature, Ellen Covey’s Blackbird is weaves the notes of summer into a fine fragrance that is very wearable by anyone who enjoys the juxtaposition of dry ambery-woody notes with just a touch of juicy fruit. Blackbird was a finalist for the 2014 Art and Olfaction Awards. Released 2013. Notes: Himalayan blackberry fruit, dry grass and leaves, elemi, cedar wood and resin, woody-amber accord, fir balsam absolute, musk.

\*- Kingston Ferry, spray decants from my own EDP bottle: 3 ml $11 / 6.25ml, $21: An aromatic, aquatic, and woody fragrance inspired by the scents from land, beach, and water at a Pacific Northwest ferry dock. It’s the scent of a sunny morning when the fog is still hanging over the water, the tide’s going out, and there’s the promise of a great adventure by water. Notes: salt air, rhododendron, lavender, tarragon, chamomile, heather, cedar leaves, the sea-weathered wood pilings, diesel fuel (a botanical accord), seaweed, sun-dried driftwood, charred firewood. 



\*- Mardi Gras, spray decants from my own EDP bottle: 3ml $11 / 6.25ml, $21:  Every year in late winter New Orleans puts on a grand party like no other. It’s a rainbow-hued, glittering, skanky, riotous, celebration of everything there is to celebrate, flowing in and out like a shiny snake amidst the flower-strewn, humidity-drenched, decaying streets of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras may present a polite, rich veneer of real orange blossom and vanilla, like a southern belle delicately munching on a beignet dusted with powdered sugar, but behind the pretty, festive costume are dark undercurrents of voodoo and hoodoo, midnight rituals and outrageous secrets that can only be unleashed under the protective camouflage of the innocent-looking mask. Notes: Orange blossom, neroli, cistus, benzoin, vanilla, civet, special musk blend.

I’m 25, based in **East Van**, and putting this out there to see if I can find a real romantic connection. I’ve gone the dating app route before, but honestly, I didn't have the best experience. My last partner from the apps ended up cheating on me, so I’m feeling pretty put off by the ""swipe"" culture and how forced everything feels.

Surprisingly, I’ve met some of my best friends through Reddit by finding people with common interests. Since I realized there’s a local dating subreddit, I figured I’d give this a shot to see if we can build something more organic.

# The ""Friends First"" Approach

I’m looking for someone who is down to just meet up, hang out, and do things together. I definitely miss having someone to spend quality time with, but I’m really hoping we can be **friends first**.

Dating apps always feel so forced—everyone tries to progress things too fast. I feel like the best relationships start as a solid friendship where things progress naturally. I really value loyalty and open communication—I'm a ""what you see is what you get"" kind of guy, and I'd love to find someone who is the same. **I'm totally down for a low-pressure first hang, like grabbing a coffee and walking a park or going to a cafe or even something you have in mind

# What I’m Looking For: Mindset over ""Fitness""

What matters to me way more than being ""fit"" is your **mindset and confidence**. I’m looking for someone who:

* **Is down to meet up (after we chat!):** I’m definitely not trying to rush anyone—we can talk and get to know each other first, of course. But once we vibe, I prefer someone who is open to meeting in person rather than just being pen pals forever.
* **Is confident in themselves:** Confidence is one of the most attractive traits to me.
* **Is willing to try stuff:** You don’t have to be a pro athlete, but I’d love a partner who is willing to be active. Whether it's badminton, working out, or hiking—I just care that you’re willing to step outside your comfort zone.

# Interests: The Active & The Chill

If an activity is physical, I’m probably down. I play badminton weekly, but I’m open to anything (gym, rock climbing, etc).

However, I also have a big ""chill"" side. I’m a fan of:

* **Gaming:** I play here and there when I have free time. I haven’t been playing much lately, but I think playing games together is a really cute way to bond.
* **Movies/Shows:** I love a good movie night or just binging a show to unwind.
* **Food & Cooking:** I love exploring new food spots around East Van, but I also enjoy cooking a good meal at home.

# About Me

* **The Basics:** 25, East Asian, with an athletic build.
* **The Vibe:** I take pride in dressing well and I do wear earrings. Bonus points if you like guys with jewelry! I’ll be the first to admit that my fits can sometimes give off a bit of a **""Kevin Nguyen"" or ""fuckboy"" vibe**—but I promise I’m actually looking for something meaningful and grounded.
* **Fitness:** I’m in very good shape—reaching a high fitness level is a big part of my life. I’m mainly fit from a mix of **strength training and calisthenics.** I’ve put in a lot of work to get to where I am, and I'm pretty confident in my looks because of it.

# Physical Attraction & Transparency

Physical attraction is important, and I want us both to feel it. To save us both time, I’m totally down to exchange pics or Instagrams early on so we don't end up wasting a day meeting someone we aren't attracted to.

**The Fitness Teaser:** [https://imgur.com/a/5L1UmW4](https://imgur.com/a/5L1UmW4)

I know this was a pretty long post, but I’m hoping it sparks some genuine interest and helps weed out people who aren't looking for the same kind of connection.

**If you're still reading, tell me: What's one hobby or activity you've always wanted to try but were too shy to do alone? Maybe we can check it off the list together.**",1,1768476547.0,vancouverdating,0,1.0,False

I tried antigravity with opus and other models but i feel like it's much slower and cannot handle complex tasks?   
It asks so many times if I allow it to do something, so i cannot add a prompt and go get coffee. 

But i cannot give it full permission to just do anything... cannot risk it tampering with production.

I also cannot figure out how to move the Agent conversion field in antigravity to the MIDDLE of the screen so i see: File directory, agent window, terminal.

Valentine's Day came early in my house. I got the Caffe Panna collection and gave it a first taste. So far? I'm feeling love for four of the flavors, and like for the other two. I think they did a good job balancing flavors to bring variety. It leans hard on chocolate — expected for Valentine's — but you also get coffee, peanut butter and fruit. I do wish for one more fruit besides strawberry. Raspberry or cherry would have been great in here. First impressions:  
  
**Bob’s Dream:** With a peanut butter base loaded with fudge, Oreo brittle and salty cookie dough this is the early front-runner, like Ben & Jerry's taken to the next level.   
**Chocolate Dipped Strawberry:** Not the best strawberry base I've had, but it really does taste like fresh fruit. The stracciatella (fine shards) are a nice way to incorporate chocolate.  
**I Love You a Latte:** A nice twist for coffee lovers, the base creamy and light, while the espresso caramel is richer and darker. Reminds me of those late, great Starbucks pints.  
**Red Velvet Cocoa:** Maybe it's just the food color, but I've always loved this cake with its tang and mild chocolate. The base is infused with cake and there are pieces, where you get some of that cream cheese frosting. A frosting swirl would have been amazing.  
**Flourless Brownie Batter:** I am not a chocoholic, but I do like a brownie. This had a batter base and flourless brownie chunks. I did enjoy the chocolate level, but wanted a contrast. This is where a swirl of raspberry or cherry  would have been welcome. But chocolate-only folks will dig it.  
**Devil's Food Cake:** This one so far is just OK, but has done enough to earn a second date. I am hoping for more marshmallow creme as I dig in to balance the darker chocolate flavor of the base and cake mix-ins. 

I may do separate full reviews for these as I dig in over the next week or so if there's interest (and maybe even if there isn't interest!)

In the middle of Praça da Figueira, right in downtown Lisbon, there’s a place that has been part of the city’s life for almost two centuries, Confeitaria Nacional.

It opened in 1829, and it’s still run by the same family today. For some people it’s a symbol of Lisbon’s tradition and one of those places that never lose their charm.

When you walk in, you’ll notice the wooden counters, mirrors, and marble tables that keep the old character alive. Everything smells like butter, sugar, and coffee!

The house specialty is the Bolo-Rei (King Cake). The founder, Baltazar Roiz Castanheiro, brought the recipe from France in the 1800s, and it quickly became Portugal’s favorite Christmas cake. Since then, they’ve made it every year following the same recipe.

Of course, you’ll also find pastéis de nata, puff pastries, and other classics, all baked fresh every day. It’s the kind of place that makes you enjoy a piece of Lisbon’s history.

Lily: They're cutting the soccer program!

She wails dramatically.

Lily: How am I supposed to kick my way to a college scholarship if there's no soccer?!

Tom, mid pitch for a guaranteed investment opportunity involving ethically sourced alpaca wool socks, sighs dramatically.

Sarah, ever the optimist, claps her hands together.

Sarah: Alright, team Miller! Operation: Save Our Savings! Let's brainstorm ways to cut costs! We can do this! I've already started using dryer sheets from 2009. They should have that vintage, soft touch that everyone wants!

Rob, looking defeated, enters, clutching a stack of bills.

Rob: I hate to break it to you all, but our savings have sprung a leak. A very large, electricity guzzling leak. Turns out, keeping the bookstore open late so Mrs. Henderson can read Danielle Steel in peace costs a fortune.

Sarah: Mrs. Henderson?! She buys, like, one book a month! 

Sarah exclaims, throwing her hands up in exasperation.

Sarah: Rob, Martha is running a business, not a charity for lonely elderly romance enthusiasts!

Rob shrugs, looking sheepish.

Rob: She brings me cookies.

Sarah emphasizes, throwing a coupon for Buy One Get One Free dog food at the ceiling. The brainstorming session has devolved into disorganized shouting.

Sarah: We could sell Tom's Beanie Baby collection!

Tom: Those are investments, Mom! Future gold! We could cancel the cable!

Lily: But then how will I watch the World Cup?

Rob: We could...eat less?

Sarah gives him a withering look.

Sarah: We're already living on ramen and the occasional half price rotisserie chicken, Rob! We're practically professional coupon clippers at this rate!

Rob walks into work.

Martha: I've been robbed! Swindled! Bamboozled! That con artist tricked me into 'investing' in his revolutionary paperless book technology and it was all hogwash! Now I have to lay you off!

Rob's face falls.

Rob: Layoffs? But Martha…

He trails off, a lump forming in his throat.

Martha: I'm so sorry, Rob.

Martha says, her voice cracking.

Martha: You know I hate to do this, but I have no choice. I just hope to stay afloat with this loss.

Martha puts her arm around him.

Martha: We'll figure something out.

Back at the Miller house, Rob is drowning his sorrows in a half eaten bag of discounted gummy worms. Sarah is on the phone, frantically trying to drum up some stand up gigs.

Sarah: Look, I can do clean comedy! I can do political humor! I can even do a whole set about finding a matching pair of socks! Just give me a chance!

She sighs, hanging up the phone.

Sarah: No luck. Apparently, 'sock matching' isn't a hot commodity in the comedy world.

Dollar Daze, Northwood's premier purveyor of questionable consumables. The Millers are a study in despair as Sarah examines a dented can of mystery meat

Sarah: Is this...beef? Or vaguely beef shaped protein composite?

Rob, meanwhile, is staring blankly at a shelf of suspiciously cheap condiments.

Rob: I don't even know what 'flavored corn syrup' is supposed to taste like.

Anya: Mother, the optical clarity of this magnifying glass is surprisingly adequate for its price point. Anya states matter of factly.

Anya: It could be useful for identifying microorganisms in Project Pollination samples.

Dr. Boseman looks harried.

Dr. Boseman: Yes, Anya, excellent. I'm just hoping to find some discounted batteries for the smoke detector. Budget cuts, remember?

Lily spots Anya and her face lights up.

Lily: Anya! What are you doing here?

Anya looks up from the magnifying glass.

Anya: We are procuring materials for scientific research. What are *you* doing here?   

Lily: We're...stocking up.

Lily says evasively, gesturing toward the dented cans and suspicious sauces. Sarah recognizes Dr. Boseman straightens up immediately.

Sarah: Dr. Boseman! Fancy seeing you here. Just, uh, exploring the local culinary scene! 

Dr. Boseman raises an eyebrow, taking in the Millers' woebegone expressions.

Dr. Boseman: Right. 'Culinary scene'. I understand. Budgetary constraints can force one to appreciate the...unique offerings of establishments such as this.

Tom: A lot of the toys in this place are toys that didn't sell as much as they hoped and now are just sitting in a warehouse and they just dump them onto the dollar stores, I mean why do you think they have so many skylanders and disney infinity?

Dr. Boseman stares at her phone. 

Dr. Boseman: Oh, sorry, I was diagnosed with scroll zombie syndrome, I need to drool over my phone and take in all those brains or else I'll die of starvation, Anya here was diagnosed with teenage zombie syndrome, she's always slouching around tiredly and moaning when I talk to her.

Anya is tapping her thumbs on her phone. Anya sighs and moans.

Anya: Motherrr, they left.

Anya stuck her head up from her phone.

Dr. Boseman: Dang it, I always talk too much.

Anya: Mother, can you stop talking?

Dr. Boseman looked at Anya, upset.

Dr. Boseman: Why are you getting so upset at me? I feel like I don't spend enough time with you. Every night I don’t get home from the lab until 6:00. You spend all afternoon after school and dinner alone, what do you even do when I'm not home?

Anya lies on the couch in a swimsuit. She grabs spaghetti with sauce and shoves it in her mouth then wipes it on her leg.

Anya: Ugh, I have to pee.

Anya grabs a glass.

Dr. Boseman: You always run around when I come home.

Anya hears the car drive into the driveway. 

Anya: Ohh shush.

Anya dumps her glass into the toilet and flushes it. Anya grabs a fork and sits at the table.

Dr. Boseman: I found your bra under the couch yesterday.

Anya: It was probably yours you just don’t remember.

Dr. Boseman: Anya, I can remember everything.

While picking up trash, Rob stumbles upon a flyer promising an Exclusive Northwood Opportunity to a new investment scheme promising incredible returns. It features a picture of a smiling, charismatic man named Rex Sterling, who claims to be a finance genius. Rob clutches the flyer, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

Rob: Could this be the answer? Could this be the thing that saves the bookstore? And allows us to make enough money for Lily's college fund?

Meanwhile, at the Miller house, Rob has his get rich quick glasses on, Tom is playing Tax Avoiders on his Atari 2600+

Rob: Okay, team, I have found the answer! Rex Sterling, self proclaimed finance genius, is offering an exclusive opportunity right here in Northwood! A chance to multiply our money exponentially!

Sarah eyes the flyer with suspicion.

Sarah: I say he’s a self proclaimed idiot, Rob, honey, remember that time you invested in that underwater basket weaving business?

Rob: This is different! Also it turns out you need to have a basket weaving degree to run a basket weaving business, this is Rex Sterling! He's a visionary! He's...a Sterling!

Sarah: Well Veronica Sterling is pretty cool and she's a great news anchor.

Lily, still distraught about soccer, chimes in.

Lily: If he's so rich, why does he have such a cheap looking flyer? We could make a better one ourselves! I learned some photoshop skills when I was trying to make myself look like a professional soccer player.

Sarah: You know how to use Photoshop? All those hours in the rec room. I am so proud!

Rob, however, is undeterred.

Sarah: They're just jealous of his success! This is our chance, people! Our chance to finally be financially secure! Our chance for Lily to achieve her soccer dreams! We're just going to take out a loan. No big deal.

Sarah throws her hands up.

Rob: A loan?! Rob, we can barely afford ramen! How are we going to pay back a loan?

Rob: We'll be swimming in money, Sarah! So big we will swim in the money in the bank!

Anya walks down the stairs wearing a romper.

Megan: Stop!

A female robot with a maid outfit with her breast crack showing and a short skirt with 5 inch high heels is standing there.

Anya: Oh right, mother is omnisexual.

Megan: You are homosexual.

Dr. Boseman: I told her I was po-mosexual, it means I don’t do labels, are you voiced Megan Fox?

Megan: I have a sexy design, of course I'm voiced by Megan Fox, now are you going to remove your mothers maternity jumper or am I going to have to remove it for you?

Anya: This is actually nice, add to christmas list, and also what's the hottest new single. 

Megan: Scarlett from across the street is trisexual and single.

Anya: Scarlett is single, add to christmas list.

Megan: Okay adding to christmas list.

Anya: No, no, no, no.

Anya trudges out the door.

Anya: I’m going to Tom’s house!

Anya knocks on the door. Tom opens the door. 

Tom: Hey, Anya, what's going on? Like what I'm wearing, I got it from my moms dresser, ive never seen her wear it. 

Anya: Are those maternity overalls? 

Tom: What? No!

Anya pulls the pocket and it leans in front of him. 

Tom: Okay, you want some banana split? I can put the bowl in the pocket and you can eat it with me.

Anya: No thank you.

Anya and Dr. Boseman eat dinner.

Dr. Boseman: I was sent some new additions to your christmas list, apparently you want a maternity jumper and Scarlett from across the street.

Anya: Megan, got my orders wrong.

The grandiose ballroom of the Northwood Community Center, decked out in cheap streamers and hastily arranged folding chairs. A banner reading Sterling Investments: Invest in Your Future! hangs crookedly above a makeshift stage. Rex Sterling, a slick haired man with an unnervingly wide smile and a suit that looks suspiciously like it came from a discount department store, struts onto the stage. A small crowd of hopeful Northwood residents, including the Millers, clap politely. Victoria Sterling, looking slightly bored behind a camera, films the event for the local news. She yawns dramatically when she thinks no one is watching.

Rex: Welcome, everyone!

Rex booms, his voice amplified by a crackly microphone.

Rex: Welcome to the dawn of a new era! An era of prosperity, of wealth, of making your dreams a reality! With Sterling Investments, you can put your money to work for you! We promise guaranteed high returns, low risk, and the chance to become part of the Sterling family! Invest today, and tomorrow you'll be sipping mimosas on a yacht!

The crowd murmurs excitedly. Rob beams, nudging Sarah. Sarah forces a smile, her eyes darting nervously around the room. Tom approaches an elderly woman near him.

Tom: You wouldn't believe the Return on Investment, lady! Think of the alpaca wool socks you could buy!

Lily, however, is more interested in the sad looking cookies being served at a nearby table. She grabs one, takes a bite, and immediately spits it out.

Lily: These taste like sadness!

She whispers to herself. 

As Rex continues his pitch, filled with buzzwords and empty promises, Dr. Boseman and Anya enter the ballroom. 

They stand near the back, observing the scene with a mixture of amusement and concern.

Anya: His rhetoric is…predictable.

Anya observes, tilting her head slightly.

Anya: The manipulation tactics are textbooks. I would estimate a success rate of approximately 67% within this demographic.

Dr. Boseman: Unfortunately, that's 67% too high.

Dr. Boseman sighs.

Anya: I have a bad feeling about this, Anya. This Rex Sterling character reeks of desperation and… hair gel.

Rob nervously signing loan papers, Sarah pacing anxiously, Tom trying to find dirt on Rex Sterling online, and Lily practicing her penalty kicks in the backyard, visualizing her future as a soccer superstar fueled by Sterling Investments' profits. As a 20 year old she kicks the ball into the net and cheers. The initial high of the dividend checks permeates the Miller household. Rob, puffed up with newfound confidence, struts into his bookstore, ready to charm the socks off any customer who dared to browse without buying.

Rob: Can I interest you in a first edition Hemingway, madam? Or perhaps a signed copy of ‘Goosebumps’ by R. L. Stine? You know, with our recent financial windfalls, I’m thinking of adding a rare books section. Maybe even a café! Think of it: books *and* Emerald Estate coffee! The possibilities are endless!

Sarah, no longer confined to the Dollar Daze, finds herself browsing the aisles of Fancy Fabrications, Northwood's most overpriced home decor store. She imagines the kitchen transformed, a gleaming oasis of stainless steel and granite countertops.

Sarah: Oh, darling. you simply *must* see the custom backsplash I'm planning! Hand painted tiles depicting…well, I haven't decided yet, but it will be *fabulous!*

*She coos.*

Lily's soccer practice becomes a showcase. She sports brand new, top of the line cleats, meticulously chosen and excessively priced. During a water break, she announces to her team.

Lily: Coach says I have the potential to go pro! And soon I will be able to afford my own private soccer coach.

Tom, however, remains skeptical. He spends his evenings hunched over his computer, digging deeper into Rex Sterling's past. He discovers a string of failed ventures, questionable business practices, and a remarkably consistent pattern of disappearing just before the lawsuits start piling up. He prints out his findings, compiling a dossier titled Operation: Sterling Silver Lining or Ponzi Scheme? One evening, as the Millers are enjoying a slightly more upscale dinner of frozen lasagna (Sarah insisted on the organic brand), Tom slams his dossier onto the table.

Tom: Okay, guys, I have proof! Rex Sterling is a fraud! His 'investments' are just a pyramid scheme! He's using new investors' money to pay off the old ones!

Rob scoffs, waving a dismissive hand.

Rob: Tom, you're just jealous that your brilliant father has finally struck it rich! This is real, son! Real money! Real yachts in our future!

Sarah, however, is visibly worried.

Sarah: Rob, Tom makes a good point. What happens if the new investors stop coming? Where does the money come from then?

Rob: Don't be ridiculous, Sarah! People will *always* want to invest in Sterling brilliance! Besides,

Rob adds with a wink.

Rob: I've already convinced Dave and Catherine to invest their life savings! They're practically counting down the days until they can retire to the Bahamas!

Lily, preoccupied with designing her future soccer stadium, barely registers the conversation. Lily, in her 20s, is standing in the middle of the field. She cuts a ribbon in the middle of the field.

Lily: I now open Lily Miller stadium!

The next day, Lily finds herself on the soccer field, ready to dominate the game with her new equipment and newfound confidence. However, her performance is lackluster. The new cleats feel stiff and unfamiliar, she puts her hand in her shoe, feeling her foot,  the pressure of living up to her imagined professional soccer career weighs heavily on her. She misses a crucial penalty kick, leading her team to a crushing defeat. 

Dr. Boseman is showering, she grabs a bottle of whiskey and takes a swig, the door is open.

Dr. Boseman: Megan, can you scrub my back for me?

Megan walks into the bathroom.

Dr. Boseman: Close the door.

Dr. Boseman: Take off your clothes.

Megan: You only drink alcohol in the shower.

Dr. Boseman: That's right Megan.

Megan massages Dr. Boseman, Dr. Boseman has one towel over her breasts and one towel over her crotch.

Dr. Boseman: Megan, take off the upper towel, and massage my top. 

Megan is positioned like a chair Dr. Boseman is sitting on her vibrating, moaning and drooling. Megan runs around in a bikini in a sprinkler on the lawn. Lily watches through the window.

Lily: Mom! Ms. Boseman's doing something weird again!

Sarah: Uh huh!

Anya sits at the table eating a hamburger from FB, the packaging is all in black and white.

Anya: Mom, you need to stop.

Dr. Boseman is lying on the floor, a burger on a wrapper placed on Megan's bare bottom.

Anya: You're eating a burger off a robot's butt.

Dr. Boseman: You know Anya, I have depleted mother syndrome, I am depleted from taking care of you, I need this whether you like it or not, Megan i’m going to need to use you as a literal body pillow tonight.

Megan: You are diurnal, and have short sleeper syndrome.

Dr. Boseman: She knows me so well.

Anya: You know I think the reason I’m so tired every morning is because I have long sleeper syndrome, and you have short sleeper syndrome, you don’t need as much sleep as I do.

Megan: You do not have long sleeper syndrome, you need the average amount of sleep to feel awakened and refreshed.

Anya: Shut up Meg!

Victoria Sterling is broadcasting a special report: Sterling Investments: Miracle or Mirage? Residents all over Northwood have started to invest their money into Sterling Investments, a company that promises high returns and a brighter future. I did some research, Sterling investments is a brand new company, has no real assets, and Rex Sterling, my brother himself has a vague and suspicious background, you need to pull your funds now!

Lily: It's true, I did some research too.

Rob: Oh come on Lily pad dont be such a Debbie downer.

Victoria Sterling, looking remarkably composed amidst the chaos, is doing a live report, the camera slightly swaying.

Victoria Sterling: Well, Northwood, it seems our dreams of yachts and mimosas have sunk faster than a lead balloon! Rex Sterling, my brother, the man who promised us the world, has vanished into thin air, leaving behind a sea of broken promises and empty bank accounts!

She pauses, adjusting her hair.

Victoria Sterling: But fear not, Northwood! Your intrepid news anchor is here to get to the bottom of this scandal, no matter how many designer handbags it takes to track him down!

At Tony’s Sports Bar Rob sits slumped at the counter, nursing a beer the color of regret. Tony, the bartender, polishes glasses with more force than necessary, a deep frown etched on his face.

Tony: Rough day, Rob?

Rob sighs, the sound heavy with despair. 

Rob: Rough doesn't even begin to cover it, Tony. I lost everything. EVERYTHING! Our savings, the loan, even Lily's stupid soccer cleats…

Dave shuffles in, wearing his usual Costco attire, but with an extra layer of gloom. His comb over is even more disheveled than usual. He slumps onto a bar stool next to Rob.

Dave: Don't I know it, Rob, I put my whole retirement fund into Sterling Investments. I was gonna finally get that jet ski I always wanted. Now I'm gonna be bagging groceries at Costco until I'm 90! And now my kids are going to have to work there!

A commercial for Wendy's plays on the overhead tv.

Narrator: Yeah, I did my Taxes.

S

Narrator: Ate Wendy’s!

He sobs quietly into his camouflage shorts. Catherine, using her cane, gently navigates her way into the bar. She finds a seat.

Catherine: Hello, gentlemen, sounds like a rather unfortunate situation has unfolded.

Rob: Unfortunate? Catherine, I'm ruined!

Rob wails.

Rob: I dragged my whole family into this mess!

Catherine: Indeed.

Catherine replies thoughtfully.

Catherine: But tell me, Rob, what have you learned from this experience?

Rob stares at her blankly.

Rob: Learned? I learned that I'm an idiot! That I can't be trusted with money! That…

Catherine: Hold on, Rob.

Catherine interrupts. 

Catherine: You learned that get-rich-quick schemes are rarely what they seem. You learned the importance of critical thinking, and perhaps a healthy dose of skepticism. And most importantly, you learned the value of family and community.

Dave sniffs, wiping his eyes with a crumpled napkin.

Dave: Yeah, I guess I learned that jet skis aren't everything.

Tony chimed in.

Tony: I think I learned never to trust a guy with hair that slick. And maybe to read the fine print a little closer. Lost all my tips I was saving to finally fix the jukebox. Now what am I gonna do?

Officer Bumble walks in.  
Officer Bumble: I invested police funds. 

Rob: The police fund?! You invested the police fund?!

Bumble shrinks under Rob's gaze.

Officer Bumble: In my defense, Sterling promised us, flying police cars I thought it was for the greater good!

Sarah is applying a face mask made of questionable ingredients from the back of the pantry. Tom is surrounded by printouts, connecting lines between names and dates with a red marker. Rob bursts in, energized despite his earlier despondency.

Rob: Alright, Millers! Operation: Get Rex Sterling's Nice Head Of Hair Back Here is a GO! Lily, what have you got?

Lily: I found a connection between Sterling and a corporation in Braudale. Someone transferred a large sum of money there just before Sterling disappeared.

Tom nods, pointing to one of his printouts.

Tom: And I found this. Rex Sterling has a twin brother living in Braudale! He owns a hotel.

Sarah peels off a strip of her face mask.

Sarah: Braudale, huh? Sounds about right for a con artist.

Rob claps his hands together.

Rob: Alright, pack your bags, team! We're going to Braudale!

Sarah: What?! Rob, I can't just leave! I have a gig at the Chuckle Bucket tomorrow night!

Tom: And I have school!

Tom protests.

Tom: Ms. Harris will fail me.

Lily: But Mom, the people of Northwood are depending on us! We can't let Sterling get away with this!

Rob puts on his most inspiring face.

Rob: Look, I know this is crazy, but we have to do something. We can't just sit here and watch our neighbors lose everything. Besides, think of the material, Sarah! A family chasing a con artist through a large playground? That's comedy gold!

Sarah sighs, a mixture of exasperation and reluctant excitement in her eyes.

Sarah: Fine, Rob, you win. But if this ends with me getting arrested for assaulting a con artist in a hotel lobby, you're…I don't know but something unpleasant is going to happen to you.

Rob, emboldened by his family's begrudging acceptance, is practically vibrating with energy. 

Rob: Alright, gang, let's pack! Braudale, here we come!

Martha: Good luck catching that crook!

Martha shouts as she hands Rob a thick envelope from outside the Van. 

Martha: Now to recover my money! If you don’t, I’ll have to run away to Mexico. 

Martha holds up a book that says becoming latina in 10 steps.

Rob: Martha, you are a real lifesaver!

Rob shouts as driving off into the sunset. 

Martha: Let's see, Step One: Date Mexican men, Step Two: Learn Homestyle Cooking…

Dr. Boseman walks into Anya’s room.

Dr. Boseman: Anya.

Dr. Boseman began, setting down her own mug of herbal tea.

Anya: Wow you found something more important than cuddling with your sex robot.

Anya: Don’t sass me young lady, we need to discuss your immediate after school plans.

Anya, mid scroll through Instagram while sitting in bed, barely looked up.

Anya: Mom, can we *not* talk about after school already?

Dr. Boseman: This is about experience.

Dr. Boseman stated, her tone firm but not unkind.

Dr. Boseman: I've arranged for you to intern at the lab. Specifically, my lab.

Anya's thumb froze mid scroll. Her head snapped up, eyes wide with a mixture of disbelief and horror.

Anya: You...you did *what*? Mom! An internship? At *your* lab? Is this some kind of extended punishment for that A- in physics last semester?

Dr. Boseman: This is not a punishment, Anya, It's an invaluable opportunity. You constantly express a desire for independence, for understanding the 'real world.' This is it. You'll be working alongside professionals, observing, assisting, learning what it means to be accountable for tasks beyond homework.

Anya: But I don’t want to get a *real* job!

Anya protested, throwing her hands up. 

Anya: You'll be learning data analysis, proper documentation, the intricacies of experimental design…skills that will serve you no matter what path you choose.

Anya: How am I supposed to tell Tom I'm going to be spending my afternoons counting bacteria instead of, you know, doing anything fun?

Dr. Boseman simply sipped her tea. 

Dr. Boseman: You'll explain that you're gaining practical experience that will put you miles ahead of your peers. And who knows.

She added a faint, almost imperceptible smile touching her lips.

Anya: You might even find it...stimulating.

Anya just stared at her. 

As they pull out of Northwood, past the forlorn faces of their neighbors, Rob pumps his fist in the air. Rob: Braudale, here we come!

He shouts, a little too enthusiastically. Sarah rolls her eyes.

Sarah: Let's just try to keep this operation vaguely legal, Rob. Okay?

Tom, buried in his phone, is already researching Braudale hotels.

Tom: The Sterling family owns a few, but this one seems the most likely. It's called 'The Gilded Hotel. Lily: We need a plan. We should go undercover. Maybe Mom can pretend to be a wealthy socialite, and I can be her pampered daughter.

Sarah snorts.

Sarah: Honey, I haven't been wealthy a day in my life. I'm more of a 'slightly above broke' socialite.

Rob, ever the optimist, chimes in.

Rob: Don't worry, Sarah, you'll charm them with your wit!

The Millers van coughs and sputters as it pulls into Braudale. Northwood's quaint charm and Braudale's gleaming skyscrapers are immediately apparent.

Lily: Wow.

Lily says, peering out the window.

Lily: This place is...shiny. 

Sarah: And expensive.

Sarah adds, grimacing at the price of gas at a nearby station.

Sarah: We're going to be eating ramen for a month after this.

Tom, glued to his phone, directs Rob through the labyrinthine streets.

Tom: Okay, Dad, take a left onto Golden Goose Boulevard. The Gilded Hotel should be coming up on your right.

The Gilded Hotel is everything its name suggests: a towering edifice of gold tinted glass, with uniformed doorman and a red carpet that stretches halfway down the block.

Rob: Alright, team.

Rob says, parking the van in a back alley (the only place they could afford).

Sarah: Time to put our plan into action. Remember, Sarah, you're a wealthy socialite named Beatrice Vanderbilt…what are you wearing?

Sarah turned her head to Rob to show a diamond in her forehead. 

Rob: Sarah, what are you wearing?

Sarah: This is my third eye ring, makes me look fancy doesn’t it? 

Rob turned around.

Tom: Transverse lobe ring.

Lily: Monroe ring.

Sarah: Relax Rob, have some fun.

Rob: Fine, Tom, you're the pampered son, Theodore Vanderbilt. Lily, you are their tiny, fierce, business minded surrogate daughter Liliana Vanderbilt. And I'm...uh...your driver, Reginald….Bandervilt.

Sarah raises an eyebrow.

Sarah: Bandervilt? Seriously, Rob?

Rob: Hey, it's the best I could come up with on short notice.

Rob defends himself, adjusting his ill fitting chauffeur cap. The family emerges from the van looking hilariously out of place amidst the Braudale elite. Sarah, in a borrowed dress from Catherine that is just a little too tight, attempts a regal pose. Tom, trying to look nonchalant, is tripping over a luggage cart. Lily, with a determined glint in her eyes from money, is practicing her I own this place walk. And Rob, as Reginald, is nervously adjusting his cap. They enter the Gilded Hotel's opulent lobby, which is filled with glittering chandeliers, marble floors, and impeccably dressed patrons. Sarah strides confidently towards the front desk, trying to ignore the stares of the other guests.

Sarah: Good morning.

She says, her voice dripping with faux sophistication.

Sarah: Beatrice Vanderbilt, party of three. Theodore, Liliana, and Reginald. We have a reservation. The desk clerk, a young man with perfectly sculpted hair and a condescending smile, consults his computer.

Desk Clerk: Ah, yes, Ms. Vanderbilt. The Presidential Suite. Right this way.

As they follow the clerk towards the elevators, Tom whispers to Rob.

Tom: This is actually working?

Rob: Don't jinx it!

Rob hisses back. The Presidential Suite is as extravagant as one might expect, with multiple bedrooms, a private balcony, and a breathtaking view of the Braudale skyline.

Rob: Okay, team. Time to split up and start looking for Rex Sterling.

Reginald accidentally spills coffee on a wealthy businessman.

Businessman: Watch where you're going, this is kopi luwak coffee.

Rob: Ooh what's that?

Reginald: It’s made of coffee beans partially digested through an asian palm civet.

Rob: Ew.

Businessman: Of course not everyone can have such classy taste as I do.

As evening approaches, the Millers regroup in the Presidential Suite, exhausted but determined. Rob: Anything?

Rex Sterling: I found a connection between Rex Sterling and the owner of the hotel.

Rob: They've been meeting regularly in a private skybox at the Braudale hockey arena.

Rob: Hockey!

Rob exclaims, his eyes lighting up.

Rob: That's it! I knew my love of hockey would come in handy someday.

Lily: I heard the owner talking about a big poker game he's hosting tonight in the penthouse suite. Apparently, Sterling is supposed to be there.

Rob: Alright, Millers.

Rob says, clapping his hands together.

Rob: Operation: Confront Rex Sterling is a GO! Tonight, we will infiltrate the penthouse poker game! The penthouse suite is even more luxurious than the Presidential Suite, with floor to ceiling windows, a grand piano, and a lavish poker table surrounded by a group of wealthy and influential individuals. Rob, disguised as a waiter, slips into the suite unnoticed, carrying a tray of champagne glasses. Sarah, channeling her inner Bond girl, saunters in wearing a dress Catherine had lent her and that was still just a bit too tight, and she pretends to be a high rolling gambler looking for some action. Lily, armed with a hidden microphone, is feeding them information. The poker game is in full swing, and Rex Sterling (sporting a slightly different hairstyle) is holding court, flashing a winning smile. As Sarah gets up to reach for a drink, she bumps into Sterling. The drink spills all over his shirt. 

Sarah: Oops, clumsy me!

She says with a smile as the signal goes to Rob, Tom and Lily.

Rob: Okay, Millers.

Rob whispers into his headset as he approaches the table with a new order.

Rob: It's time to make our move.

Rob offers Sterling the dry cleaning service ticket, and Lily screams

Lily: Stop that man. He stole our money!

Rex Sterling freezes.

Rex: Well, well, well.

He says, his smile fading and his voice growing cold.

Rex: Looks like I have some uninvited guests.

Suddenly, the doors burst open, and Victoria Sterling strides into the room, followed by a camera crew.

Rob: I am announcing my brother to be a fraudulent con artist, I’m placing him under arrest!

Victoria barks.

Lily: But wait. He used the police fund!

Officer Bumble: That’s right I did! 

Yells Officer Bumble as he busts in the room. Chaos erupts in the penthouse suite. The wealthy gamblers scatter in panic, the security guards rush to intervene, and the camera crew films everything with relish. The Millers, caught in the middle of the melee, are determined to bring Sterling to justice. In the ensuing chaos, everything happens at once: Rob knocks out a security guard with a champagne bottle; Sarah throws a handful of poker chips in Sterling's face, distracting him long enough for Lily to snatch his briefcase; and Tom, using his computer skills, manages to disable the security system shutting everything down. As the police finally arrive to arrest Rex Sterling, the Millers stand victorious, surrounded by the wreckage of the penthouse suite. Victoria Sterling, looking slightly dishevelled but still impeccably made up, approaches them.

Victoria Sterling: Well, Millers. You've certainly made a mess of things. But I have to admit and report, you caught my brother. For that, I am grateful.

Rob: It was the least we could do.

Lily: So, what happens now?

Tom: We get our money back?

Victoria Sterling: Of course. And perhaps, a little something extra for your troubles. lawyers draw up the contracts. In the meantime, enjoy the Presidential Suite.

Sarah: Thank you very much, Ms Sterling.

Victoria Sterling: It’s the least I could do.

1qdh08j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1qdh08j/filter_basket_wobble/,Filter basket wobble,"Hi all,

I bought a robot 2 months ago and I’m enjoying it a lot, but I noticed something I find a bit odd coming from semi automatic espresso machines.

The filter basket doesn’t necessarily sit flush in the holder and it can be wobbled a bit. I can’t really tell if the plunger makes it a non-issue or if there is some other explanation and it has been in the back of my mind for a while now.
The concern I have is that the coffee puck is askew when pulling the shot or that it changes.

Does anyone else recognize this?

1qdgses,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JreedaF/comments/1qdgses/the_golden_curse/,The Golden Curse,"​I found it in a box of ""junk"" I bought at a local estate sale for twenty dollars. A heavy, tarnished copper band with engravings that looked less like art and more like a warning. When I slipped it onto my wrist, the world didn't change—I did. I watched my hand vanish, then my arm, until I was looking at a void where my body used to be.
​At first, it felt like a superpower. The possibilities were intoxicating. I didn't think about the ethics; I thought about our mounting debts and the life my wife, Sarah, deserved.
​The heist was easier than I imagined. Walking into the vault was like passing through a ghost's dream. I walked out with a duffel bag stuffed with cash, feeling like the king of the world. But when I got home, the celebration ended.
​I reached for the clasp of the bracelet. It wouldn't budge. It felt like it had fused with my bone, becoming a part of my anatomy. I pulled until my skin bled, but I remained a phantom.
​Sarah came home to a mountain of cash on the kitchen table and an empty house. I stood right in front of her, screaming her name, grabbing her shoulders—but my hands passed through her like a breeze, and my voice was nothing more than a hum in the air she couldn't recognize.
​She cried for weeks. She thought I had robbed the bank and abandoned her, leaving the money as a parting gift for a life of crime on the run.
​I stayed. I became the ""ghost"" of our home. I would nudge the coffee mug she forgot, fix the drafty window, and tuck the blanket around her while she slept. I lived in the spaces between her breaths, a silent guardian watching the woman I loved slowly move on from the memory of me.
​Then came Mark.
​When she first brought him home, jealousy turned my blood to ice. I wanted to kill him. I spent nights smashing plates when they were near, flickering the lights, and making the house a living nightmare for him. I wanted him to run. I wanted her to stay mine, even if ""mine"" meant she was alone forever.
​But one night, I saw her face in the candlelight. She wasn't scared of the ""ghost""; she was terrified of the loneliness. She was aging, her eyes tired from years of looking for a man who was standing right in front of her but couldn't be seen.
​Mark stayed. He was patient. He loved her.
​I realized then that my jealousy was a second cage. The bracelet had taken my body, but my selfishness was taking her life.
​So, I stopped haunting. I started helping. I found Mark’s lost keys so he wouldn't be late for their dates. I kept the house warm. I made sure the environment was perfect for the day he finally knelt and asked her to be his wife.
​The wedding was small, held in our backyard. As they said their vows, I stood between them, invisible and silent. I placed my unseen hand on Sarah's shoulder one last time, a final blessing, before stepping back into the shadows to let her live the life I could no longer give her.
​I am still here. A ghost in a house that is no longer mine, watching the woman I love be happy with someone else. It is the hardest thing I have ever done—and the only way I could truly love her.",1,1768475480.0,u_JreedaF,0,1.0,False

1qdgpjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1qdgpjg/you_can_literally_rewire_your_brain_in_30_days/,You Can Literally REWIRE Your Brain in 30 Days: The Neuroscience Protocol That Actually Works,"Okay so I've been deep diving into neuroscience research for the past few months because my brain felt like mush. Scrolling for hours, forgetting why I walked into rooms, zero focus during work. Classic brain fog hell.

Turns out there's legit science behind why our brains feel so fried, and more importantly, how to fix it. I've compiled everything from top neuroscientists, research papers, podcasts with experts like Andrew Huberman, and honestly some of this stuff is wild. Not the usual ""drink water and meditate"" advice everyone parrots.

The best part? You don't need expensive supplements or a PhD to understand this. Just consistency and like 20-30 minutes daily.

 1. morning sunlight exposure (within 30 mins of waking)

This sounds stupidly simple but it's actually the foundation of everything. Your brain has a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that controls literally every biological function. When you get bright light in your eyes early (not through windows, actual outdoor light), you're essentially hitting the reset button on your circadian rhythm.

Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. 10-15 minutes of morning sunlight triggers a cortisol spike at the right time, which then sets up your melatonin production 12-16 hours later. Better sleep equals better brain function. It's that straightforward.

On cloudy days you need longer exposure, maybe 20-30 mins. This single habit improved my energy more than any amount of coffee ever did.

 2. the 90 minute focus protocol

Your brain operates in ultradian cycles, roughly 90 minute periods where you can sustain deep focus. After that, your prefrontal cortex literally needs a break. Trying to push through is like trying to sprint a marathon.

Here's the protocol: pick ONE task, remove all distractions (phone in another room, no notifications), work for 90 mins max, then take a 20 min break where you do something completely different. Walk outside, do pushups, stare at nothing. Don't scroll.

The first 5-10 mins of each session will feel difficult. That's your brain transitioning into focus mode. Push through that friction and it gets easier. I use an app called Forest to gamify this, you grow virtual trees while staying focused and it's weirdly motivating.

This changed how i approach everything. One 90 min block of real focus beats 6 hours of distracted ""productivity"" any day.

 3. strategic cold exposure

Cold showers or ice baths trigger a massive release of norepinephrine and dopamine. We're talking 200-300% increases that last for hours. This isn't bro science, the research is solid.

Start with 30 seconds of cold at the end of your regular shower. Gradually work up to 2-3 minutes. The initial shock is intense but your body adapts surprisingly fast.

The mental benefits are insane. It's like hitting a reset switch on your nervous system. After a few weeks you actually start craving it because your brain associates it with that dopamine hit.

Dr Susanna Soeberg has done extensive research on this. Her book ""Winter Swimming"" breaks down the science and practical protocols. She's studied cold water swimmers for years and the cognitive benefits they experience are measurable and significant.

 4. NSDR (non sleep deep rest)

This is basically guided relaxation that puts your brain in a state similar to sleep but you're conscious. It helps restore mental resources and improve neuroplasticity.

Yoga nidra is the most researched form. There's a protocol developed at Stanford that shows 10-20 mins of NSDR can compensate for lost sleep and dramatically improve focus and learning.

I use the Insight Timer app which has thousands of free yoga nidra sessions. The ones by Jennifer Piercy are phenomenal, her voice is super calming and she has sessions ranging from 10-45 mins. When I'm mentally exhausted in the afternoon, 15 mins of this genuinely works better than caffeine.

If you want a more structured way to absorb all this neuroscience stuff without the time commitment, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books like ""Spark,"" Huberman's research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. You can set a goal like ""optimize my brain for better focus"" and it generates a custom learning plan based on how your brain actually works. Plus you can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly good, some people swear by the smoky narrator for learning sessions. Makes it way easier to stay consistent when the content actually fits your schedule and learning style.

The key with NSDR is doing it consistently. Your brain gets better at dropping into that restorative state with practice.

 5. backwards walking or novel movement

Neuroplasticity (your brain's ability to form new connections) gets activated when you do unfamiliar movements. Walking backwards forces your brain to recruit different neural pathways and increases BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), which is basically miracle grow for your neurons.

Sounds weird but try walking backwards for 5-10 mins. Or learn to juggle. Or practice any movement pattern that feels awkward and unfamiliar. This literally builds new neural connections.

There's a book called ""Spark"" by Dr John Ratey (he's a Harvard psychiatry professor) that dives deep into how movement affects brain chemistry. It's packed with research showing exercise is basically the most powerful tool we have for optimizing brain function. He breaks down exactly which types of movement do what, and why novelty matters so much for cognitive enhancement.

 6. strategic caffeine timing

Most people drink coffee immediately after waking which actually works against your natural cortisol rhythm. You get a temporary boost followed by a crash.

Delay caffeine 90-120 mins after waking. Let your natural cortisol do its thing first, then use caffeine to extend that alert state. Also cut off caffeine at least 10 hours before bed because it has a longer half life than most people realize.

When you do drink it, pair it with L-theanine (found in green tea or as a supplement). This smooths out the jittery edge and improves focus quality. The combination is well researched and honestly makes such a difference.

 7. phone-free mornings

Your first hour sets your neurochemical tone for the day. When you immediately grab your phone, you're flooding your brain with dopamine from random stimuli. This makes it way harder to focus on less stimulating tasks later.

No phone for the first 60 mins after waking. Just try it for a week and notice the difference. Your attention span will improve dramatically.

I started keeping my phone in another room overnight and using an actual alarm clock. Game changer. Mornings feel so much calmer and my focus throughout the day is noticeably better.

 8. strategic social connection

This one surprised me but isolation literally shrinks parts of your brain. Social interaction (even brief positive exchanges) triggers oxytocin release and activates reward pathways that improve cognitive function.

If you work from home or spend a lot of time alone, intentionally schedule social time. Even a 10 min conversation with a barista or neighbor counts. Your brain needs this input.

The book ""Social"" by Matthew Lieberman (UCLA neuroscience professor, his research has been cited thousands of times) explains how our brains are fundamentally wired for connection and how social pain activates the same neural circuits as physical pain. It's a fascinating look at why loneliness tanks our cognitive performance so hard and what we can do about it.

Look, none of this is revolutionary on its own. But stacking these protocols together creates compound effects. I've been following this for about 6 weeks and the difference is honestly dramatic. My focus is sharper, energy is more stable, sleep is better, mood is way more consistent.

The science is there. Multiple neuroscientists have published research backing all of this. But research doesn't mean shit if you don't actually implement it.

Start with 2 or 3 of these. Morning sunlight and the 90 min focus blocks are probably the highest leverage. Build from there. Give it 30 days before you judge whether it's working.

Your brain is plastic. It can change. You just have to give it the right inputs consistently enough that new patterns stick.",3,1768475193.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

1qdgowk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1qdgowk/anyone_won_the_battle_against_candida_without/,Anyone won the battle against candida without dieting?,"Hi everyone,

I am exhausted, and trying again to get better. I've been having urine infections and candidiasis alternating for years, and after covid and some surgeries, everything escalated to a nightmare. Severe insomnia, tiredness, cognitive impairment, depresion, lack of energy... hell.

Finally, last year I was diagnosed a Helicobacter Pilory infection. The treatment (Pylera + omeprazole +lactoferrine + s. boulardii) was hard, and it worked: eliminated the Helicobacter. BUT escalated SIBO as much as I lost 5 kilos in 3 months just of being too sick to eat.

Then I found out it was Sufide SIBO \* and started dieting very hard (I only could eat potatos, carrots, pumpkin, endives, cucumber, zucchini, fish and white rice just boiled with spices, and olive oil without cooking it)  and treating it with Pepto Bismol ultra, lactoferrin, Saccaromices Boulardii, L. Coagulans, berberine y glucosamine. I stopped all the supplements which kept me functional before and those weeks were HELL. I was hungry, sad, furious and so, so, so tired... But the thirdt week I started to feel better. Less bloated, with some energy and my body was getting along with the diet - I got to make somewhat similar to bread of rice and felt less anxious-. So I started trying new vegetables, chicken and to reintroduce fibers.

The thirth day of having a  tiny coffee spoon of flax seeds, psillium and gluten free oatmeal I started with urine infection symptoms. The fifth day I went to the hospital as it was worse, and there it was: escherichia coli infection and antibiotic treatment. So... back to the step one, safe diet (my six vegetables, fish and rice) and s. boulardii to avoid candida with the antibiotic. But guess what... the thirdt week after the treatment my body didn't resisted and had vaginal candidiasis. But not only down there: candida took control of all the digestive system because just with carrot sugar I got the pregnat woman belly in 20 minutes after eating. My safe diet wasn't safe anymore.

And then, fluconazole. But my doctor gave me only the vaginal candidiasis dose -she doesn't know how to treat dysbiosis, I think that she doesn't even believe I am really sick-, and so I went on later with herbs (oregano, neem, berberine, bromelain, cinnamon, reishi, lions mane, s. boulardii... God how much money have I throwed at this point...). I had lost 10 kilos at that point, in blood samples my defenses apeared lowered,  and I decided I was killing myself along with the bad guys. So I started eating healthy (I always have, we eat mediterranean diet, I cook a lot and don't use processed food. Little room for improvement there) with no restrictions and went on with supplements and herbs, stopping for weeks not to irritate my digestive system too much. Then I did a microbiome test and it seemed that the SIBO bad guys were back to normal, but the good guys were very low. No akkermansia, the gut brain axis totally devastated, many others low and candida just in the overgrowth limit. PH altered (8) and Zonuline (gut permeability) also altered.

And here I am: I felt candida sick again and started with a herbs bomb 3 days ago: oregano, neem, berberine, bromelain, cinnamon, reishi, lions mane, black garlic, pepermint oil, garcinia mangostana, coco oil and green tea extract. I feel the die-off but I refuse to go back dieting as I have gained 5 kilos back (and don't want to go back to the concentration camp look and the body defenses colapse again). By the way, I go on eating healthy, but I didn't quit whole grain bread and I'm trying to eat hiperproteic but that is all.

Anyone won the battle without total carbs restriction?

At the time I just thought you were a really good kisser, and those two brief seconds, to me, completely offset the tragedy of having to kiss Tomas just before that. Anyway, the more time I spent with you, the more I found you to be witty, smart, funny, charming, and beautiful. I loved your baby blue eyes, and I find myself always staring at them, wondering how they see this world. I liked talking to you about books, about writing, we shared similar interests also in Spanish and in traveling, in what we want to be, and I saw in you a kindred soul, someone who saw the world as I saw it, and while not necessarily a soulmate, or anything to that degree, I thought of you as someone who understood me, and someone I could also understand completely if you would let me. In Madrid I adored you, and wanted nothing more than to spend time alone with you. The walks around town, the ferris wheel, the opera, Cine Equis, all the time, I thought of when would be an appropriate time I could kiss you. At the time I had thought that plainly saying I’m in love with you would be way too uncool, not suave, and many times those words almost slipped, but you never gave me a window, you didn’t even have to say anything for me to know that you didn’t want me to say those words, though at times I saw glimmers of hope where maybe there was something you wanted to say but didn’t, and I never knew what to make of it, or what it was you wanted to say. Times go by, and those feelings largely dissipated by the time we were all sent home, but when I do see you on the rare occasions after that, whether at Wes or elsewhere, I look for those brief moments again. Was I delusional or were those real? In my fantasies, I would tell you how I felt from all those years ago, and you would say to me “You fool, how could you not see from the start? How much time was wasted because you never had the balls.” At Dylan’s Christmas party, where we drove to the other side of Middletown, near where the lake was, that must have been five or six years ago now, his mom had asked us to write in a single word what we want more of in life and put it in a Christmas sock. You asked me what I had written. Courage, I said, and you had only smiled and said, that’s a good one. I’d likely ask the same thing this Christmas. The last time we saw each other was at Penn Station. I walked you back after brunch, though you said I didn’t have to, we hugged and said goodbye, and you went off to the tracks. I waited and watched to see if you’d turn around, not expecting a big romantic sequence or whatnot, but just to see if you would look back and smile in a way that says, I’ll miss you. I stood in front of the Raising Cane’s until I couldn’t see you anymore, then said, Enough now, we are better off as friends anyway, and took the train back to Brooklyn. When you reached out to me over the summer that you wanted to see Bad Bunny, I hesitated but eventually said yes. I had no idea what I’ll do or which part of the world I’ll be in, but I knew it would be fun to go on a trip with you. I had no expectations, romantic or sexual, that anything would come out of this, no unspoken agenda or plans, no assumptions of your motivations, other than that this will be exciting, though I would be lying if I said I didn’t have the tiniest bit of wishful thinking in the back of my mind, not strongly, but it’s there somewhere, that maybe if I said the right things, do the right things, took you to the right places, and was more brave than I was before, that maybe you might fall in love with me. Our first day out was nice. Our walks were nice, although we didn’t see the panda, and it was nice to hear about your travels, your novel, your ideas, and we had delicious food. I enjoyed your company and I really wanted for you to love Mexico City as much as I loved Mexico City, to feel as in awe with its bustling energy as I had been when I first got there. I first noticed something was off at that cocktail bar we went to, the one with the worm salt cocktails. What’s wrong, I asked, you suddenly seem sad. You just said you were tired and wanted to go home. You can stay though if you want, you said. And I didn’t say anything, but I knew exactly what you meant, because I’ve used the same line countless times. I understand why you might have wanted to go home, to get some space, to do your own thing, those are all things I want for myself when I’m traveling, and at that moment, I saw myself for what I was being, as overbearing, and for that I’m sorry. It’s funny because I’m not usually like this, in fact I tend to be the opposite, and I’m confused as to why I am like this all of a sudden. I had a thought about it last night, and I hope you pardon the slight digression, but I thought it was rather profound: that the way we show love to others is really just an amalgamation of the way others have shown love to us, and that maybe we show it in the only ways we know how, even with all its imperfections. In eighth grade, the girl I was “talking to” would send me long letters just like the one I’m writing to you now, filled with grandiose declarations of love and attempts at vulnerability, and come to think of it, that was maybe how I came to believe that love would be best expressed through writing,in words, although I don’t know whether that’s really true. I’ve also been the person who craves space and privacy, and when bombarded with curiosity, affection, and constant demand for togetherness , thought of as neediness, ironically which I am now finding myself doing. Shit. Again I apologize for the digression, and for the neediness, but I found it rather interesting, and hope you do as well, as I’ve found myself reflecting on many things in recent days.. Anyways. I knew it was over when I saw you were talking to the guy with the earring at the taco place outside the club that shut down as soon as we got there. There, I saw your face lit up, more alive than I’ve seen you all day. You didn’t seem tired at all, though it was 4 in the morning. I was tired of the night, I wanted to go home, but you could stay if you want, I almost said, and was rather surprised you wanted to go home too. Jesus walked you home, and I know I was being immature, sulky, petty, and jealous for no good reason, but I had to [leave.You](http://leave.You) did nothing wrong, but drunk as I was, I came to the realization at that moment that I had been a fool, and that whatever residual hope I had was only in my head. I woke up the next day and decided I had to take some time to myself. I felt rather overwhelmed and frankly embarrassed to see you, with me looking like this. I took the metro to Insurgentes, walked around my old stomping grounds in Roma, read my book at Plaza Rio del Janeiro, which used to be my favorite spot in the city, though they are now sadly doing renovation work, and thought of hitting up a friend who lived nearby. You texted me and asked if I wanted to see the Mozart. I thought about it for a second, and eventually said yes. I’m not a petulant child, I thought to myself, if she wants to see me, why would I not go? But the truth is I had so many thoughts I hadn’t processed,  that I didn’t even know if I could get myself together, to act cool and undeterred, I paced around the park, and walked to the Oxxo to buy a portable charger for my dying phone. The Oxxo didn’t have it, so I went to the 7-Eleven, and they didn’t have it either. I called the Uber, and knew I would be late, and when I missed it entirely, I felt so bad for having let you down. We watched the Tigres play that night and had that awkward conversation after. I thought about bringing it up on our walk there, really, but you had beaten me to it first. Are we just friends, you asked. Yeah, I said after a long pause, since I figured already how you felt about me, not wanting the situation to be more awkward than it already was. Did you come into this trip expecting anything more, you asked. Not really, I said, truthfully rather,  albeit ambiguously ,while I was not anticipating anything but a good time,  I suppose that I had intentionally left the door open, just in case. Okay, you said, and I restrained myself from thinking that maybe I had misread the situation, that maybe you and I were on the same boat, tiptoeing around the subject, trying to come up with the right answer, instead of the truth, whether for pride, preserving some shell of dignity, keeping the peace for the remainder of the trip, avoiding hurting the other person, or shutting the door entirely. No, that was the end of it, and I accepted it fully. What I didn’t ask, though I wanted to was, did you ever feel anything more for me, and if not, why did you never want to give us a shot?. At the concert, when we got separated, truthfully, I was rather hurt that you weren’t out looking for me, like I was looking for you. I knew I had fucked up by drinking those beers even though we said we wouldn’t drink any, but I was saddened that you had not wanted more to have experienced this special moment with me. In the days after, I noticed you grew more cold, more distant, and many times I even caught you looking sad. And it made me so sad and worried to see you sad, especially because I don't know what’s making you feel sad. I wanted you to have the best time. Sometimes I see you smile, but even then I can tell there is a hurt, I know a fake smile when I see one, because I was doing the same. I tried to figure out what’s on your mind, rather incessantly in a way I could see why you might find annoying, but really all I wanted to know was, what’s bothering you, is it me, are we alright, but you didn’t crack once. Say something, I thought. Say anything. Say this was a mistake. Say you just didn’t feel the same way. Say I’m doing too much. Say I need to give it up. Shut the door completely. Or maybe I was overthinking, maybe it was something else, something that had nothing to do with me. But all the while, the silence was agonizing, seeing you obviously troubled, and not knowing why, and what part I had in all of it. What are you not saying? I wanted to ask. Are we still friends after all this is over? Please help me understand, so I know how I can be there for you, or if you want me to leave you alone, I could do that also, just let me know what to do.  But all you said was I’m fine, I’m just tired, and smiled without ever looking at me.",1,1768474647.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

It has been more than a year since we said goodbye, crying and kissing each other. We couldn't do long distances; you never had the drive to do that in any way. 

We had our own life struggles to fight, so we chose that.

Now I have fought mine and got this amazing opportunity to move to your country. Not to your city, but at least closer than where I am now. I know you told me you are fighting yours, too. Your life is shaping up exactly how you wanted, and I am so sorry, happy for you.

I am moving closer to you, and all I can think is maybe this is whatever force of nature bringing me back to you (and you back to me).

Maybe you have moved on and see me as a friend. I tried moving on, but it didn't really work. At first, I thought I did, but I always felt something was missing. Later, after breaking up with them, I realized I was trying to bury my feelings in a new relationship. I cried for hours when I realized my feelings for you were still there, lying deep within my psyche. 

Maybe we can have a friendly coffee chat when I am visiting, and you will learn that I am moving.

1qdg35d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1qdg35d/rio_celeste_timing_and_itinerary_choices/,Rio Celeste timing and itinerary choices,"I have mostly planned out our itinerary in La fortuna and have 1 day left to fit in 3 things we’d like to do - Rio Celeste, a sloth tour at papas place and ecotermales hot springs. I was wondering if this is do able in 1 day and how long a journey and hike to Rio Celeste will take out of our time? Or whether we will need to drop one of these things and a make a choice on what to miss. The hot springs we will do in the evening so likely would have to be the sloths or Rio Celeste if we can’t do both which would be a very hard choice!

The rest of our itinerary includes - 

Arenal waterfall visit 

El Salto rope swing 

Arenal Mundo Aventura zip line  

White water rafting

Arenal volcano 1968 hike - guided tour 

Don Juan coffee and chocolate tour 

We will already have some hiking and a waterfall included as well as the Arenal tour where there may be a chance of seeing sloths so we may not need to do it all but it’s very hard to know and don’t want to miss out on anything, there’s so much to see and do in this area. We will then be travelling to Manuel Antonio so may have more sloth opportunities there too as well as waterfalls to visit. We are a family of 4 with a 12 and 15 year old that don’t enjoy hikes as much as I do but would love to see wildlife and jump in any rivers/waterfalls etc. Any advice would be very much appreciated :) ",1,1768472987.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
1qdg2ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qdg2ub/rf_free/,[RF] Free,"She woke up alone on her last day. He was lying next to her, but he would never open his eyes again. Her body had known it even before she was fully conscious. It’s just one of those things. After more than 50 years in the same bed you can sense even the slightest change in your partner’s sleep. And this change was anything but. He looked beautiful still. 

She knew exactly how much water to put in the coffee maker, didn’t even need to measure it. Two scoops for her and two for- She stood there with a spoonful of coffee hovering over the filter. It felt silly making coffee for two now. It felt sillier making coffee only for herself. After all these years. She had already poured water for two cups anyway. She knew she was alone, she wasn’t fooling herself. But why should the coffee maker know? No-one would ever know anything about her again. This was it.



She threw the little coffee hill onto the bigger coffee hill. And then she threw in another scoop and then she threw the spoon to the side. And she grabbed the jar with both hands and recklessly emptied half of it into the machine. A full waft of its enlivening aroma filled the kitchen. Soon the coffee maker was overflowing with water too. She smacked down the lid, flicked it on and turned around. And then she stood there. Not because there wasn’t anywhere to be anymore, there was just nowhere she had to be. 

She giggled.



The coffee maker was purring softly. The sound of the liquid slowly dripping down, a babbling brook. Outside, the sun was bathing the forest with its warm light. Just enough to accentuate the myriads of colors emanating from the flowers and trees. The warmth reached her through the window. She walked out the backdoor, still wearing her slippers and nightgown.



She always felt, that facing the sun with your eyes closed was like the entire universe giving you a tender, warm hug, like reuniting with an old friend.



She kept going. Why stop there? She walked down the path leading into the forest. Everything smelled of summer. The birds were chirping ,the bugs were buzzing. A choir just for her. Greeting her, welcoming her amongst their midst. Wherever she was, was where she belonged. 

The trees started to clear as she reached the cliff. Even in their advanced age they would walk up here to look at the sea, or the sky, on days like this one it was hard to tell where one started and where one ended. She walked up the point where they used to stop and hold each other, looking out into infinity. Then she took another step. And then another. And she kept taking them until there were none left to take.



Freefall.



Freedom.



It wouldn’t last forever, it wouldn’t even last long, just for now. 

The last drop of coffee joined the sea beneath it. The machine stopped purring. It was full. ",1,1768472956.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Every time I have a spark of inspiration on a Saturday morning, it dies by Sunday night because I get stuck in configuration hell. The friction of starting is so high that it kills the joy of the idea.

I finally built a Day Zero scaffold for myself GitKit. No Docker, no complex cloud setup, just an .env toggle and an immediate dashboard. It’s designed to be so frictionless that your AI (Cursor/Windsurf) can actually finish the MVP before your coffee gets cold.
