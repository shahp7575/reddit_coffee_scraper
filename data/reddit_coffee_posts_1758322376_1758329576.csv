It was so sunny that although it was only 20º it was almost hot in the direct sun. For that, I was very grateful. I did not get to write as long as I wanted to because first I had to deliver some pears. Mother and I drove to Darling's house first. They gave me two books to borrow as thanks; The little prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery and a bok of batman comics from the forties. I read a little of The Little Prince as I was waiting in the car for mother to return from grocery shopping. After that, we brought some pears to a friend of father's. Finally, as I was beginning to feel a little sick, we arrived at the library where there is a community fridge. We left three little baskets of pears. One woman was just leaving the fridge when we arrived and she was very delighted to have some fresh fruit for her daughter. All in all, it was a worthwhile time that I was very happy to be done with by the time we got home. My stomach was churning and it took nearly as hour for my hands to stop trembling. It is mother's care specifically that does this to me, I swear. Whatever air-freshener she has in there is as bad as mustard gas, I swear.

I didn't start writing until 4:50 pm. Part of me wanted to abstain from writing at all, I was so queasy and shaky, but I eventually got better enough to focus on the screen. Some juice and a few bites of tart helped. I ended up writing 506 words for I'm Still Sisyphus; not as good as my recent streak but far better than nothing especially knowing I did my best.

I have a slight headache now. I'm hoping a coffee and some relaxing will fix it. Mother bought some angel food cake when she went out after dropping me off again. For some reason, angel food cake is hard to find around her so I am very much looking forward to it. I may have some of that and a pear tonight. We'll see.

I pray for Lauren to be able to heal faster than it's taking me, but its sad that I know this type of harm doesnt really go away. 

The burried anger towards mom, the rage inside me, that only surfaced in my mid twenties. 
Everyone tells the victim to ""just forgive her, she is your mom"" , ""your mom is not mentally okay you need to feel sorry for her"" 
people who didnt have manipulative narcisstic moms growing up will never understand.

My mom did her best to ruin my reputation, to let every family membef I have know that im a hoe, she made up things about me, and still does. 
then she calls me saying she misses me, she smiles to me and hugs me like she actually means it.

when I confront her, she says ""I would never do something like that, stop being hateful to me, do you think I could do something so horrible?"" or ""youre imagining stuff""

I was convinced I imagine stuff, I had a lot of memories that faded and only comes to me in pieces. 

today I will see her, I told my doctor to give me something strong beside my regular anti depressant as I will be in a very bad place for sometime after I spend few hours with her. 

Im trying to get ready for her to tear me down. Im scared of her and I dont know why, Im scared of myself of smashing her head and spending the rest of my life in jail, but its all just thoughts.
I will pretend everything is normal, spend the next days in bed crying and surviving off coffee maybe sneak some pills and alcohol when my husband is not around. 
I hate how few hours around my mom, in months, would make me suicidal and very depressed for weeks.

what is driving me crazy, those people who have good moms, why me? its something that cannot be fixed, cant be replaced, cant make it disappear, and nothing heal it.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1nlki4p,https://i.redd.it/cagjxk0qv7qf1.jpeg,I know he's gone...,"But.

I worry I'm not crying enough.

His funeral was the other day and even though we proceeded into and out of the church behind the casket holding his earthly body, it still doesn't feel real. 

I wonder when they hand me the urn with his ashes, will it finally hit me?

It's like... I know he's dead. I know it because I was there. When they announced time of death I think I stepped outside of myself and felt like I was watching a TV show. But I was there.

I try to take comfort in knowing that regardless of the trauma his physical body endured for that 3 weeks in the ICU - the lines, the cannulas, the tubes, the dozen + medications supporting him 24/7, the bleeding, the swelling, all of it - I have to believe he didn't feel any pain.

The night before he went in for his surgery, he emptied out the Keurig so he wouldn't accidentally make a cup of coffee that morning (as he was fasting pre-op).

The day after his surgery as he remained in the ICU, I was home doing dishes and put his favorite mug on the Keurig. I had a chuckle, knowing he'd laugh when he got home from the hospital a couple days later, that I'd had it set up and ready for him when he came home.

And that was a month ago. And I look at it every day. And I can't put it away. And maybe seeing it there every day is the reminder I need that he's really, truly never going to come home again.",1,1758329287.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1nlkhpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nlkhpn/reimbursement/,Reimbursement,"*IF you're asking: Who are these people? What's going on, there's actually a start to the story* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ngh2cu/discounted) *(well, it's actually the middle of the story, but counts as the beginning because I never properly learned how to start one).*

Listless Waters awoke to the hessian fabric roof of his new abode billowing gently with the breeze. Its construction was simple and crude, but it would keep the rains and the winds off of him. Although he had serious reservations about its ability to inhibit the cold, it was currently the warm season, so he would have some time to scavenge and scrounge before that truly became an issue.   

It had been a further three nights since he had first spoken to his new watchers and though the journey was long and taxed him something fierce, it had remained mostly uneventful, for which he offered a small prayer to his lost prophets. 

He groaned as he rolled to get himself up. The bedding that had been provided was stiff and unyielding, and he noted some kinks in his scales that he would have to soothe if he could manage any time to himself in the coming sun. Still, it had kept him off of the ground and provided an even platform for sleeping, so he counted his blessings, small as they were. 

“Yeah, I’m not fond of the cots either.” A new voice said. 

His attention snapped to the source and he saw a watcher, seated on a small stool, looking down at a strange object, sharing his lodgings. This one was not the first, The Liebowitz, nor the second, The Royce, it was an entirely new watcher, one whose disposition he was unfamiliar with. So he played it safe, “I apologize. I mean no disrespect. The lodgings are more than sufficient, the problem is mine.”

The new watcher let out a great snort, “Buddy, I know you’re blowing smoke up my ass. The cots suck dick, but it was the best we could do on short notice. We’ll have something better set up later today.”

Listless wanted to follow up on this ‘better’ but decided against it. While these new watchers had not strayed from their word and treated him as an equal, he still was unsure of their motivations, or if it was all a great lark that would soon be torn from him. He wouldn’t press his luck, and just enjoyed what he had been given for the time being. 

“Forgive me, but you are unfamiliar. May I ask as to where the first and the second one are?” He asked. 

The new watcher folded his object, setting it down before looking at him for the first time, “Who?”

“The watchers that brought me in, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude, if I am able to have the time.” 

The new watcher did that strange teeth-bearing ritual, and Listless instinctively winced, despite reassurances it conveyed positive emotions, such a threatening display still worried him. “You mean Lieb and Royce? They’re getting chow, it’s about lunch and they dragged my ass in here to watch you while they ate. Told me to take you to the sar’nt if you woke up.”

Listless ruminated on this for a moment, obviously, his watchers trusted this new one, so by extension, it would likely behoove him to do so as well. “I see. What is a lunch?”

The new watcher's expression didn’t change in the slightest, “It’s a midday meal. But that’s not really important right now unless you’re ravished.”

Listless was horrified. It was already half-sun? How long had he slept? He would surely be reprimanded heavily for this. “Again, I apologize. I had no way to mark the passage of time, I shall endeavor to remedy my behaviour.”

The new watcher just did the same shoulder raise that The Liebowitz seemed ever so fond of, “No need, we’re not on a schedule here, you want me to grab you a coffee or something?”

“What is a coffee?” He asked. 

“Riiiiiiiiiiiight,” the new watcher replied, “no coffee then. We better get on getting on, I’ll give you a moment to get yourself set, but if you need anything, I’ll be just outside, okay?” 

Listless just nodded his assent, and this new watcher left him alone with his thoughts. 

It seemed that these strange watchers were doing everything in their power to gain his trust, or perhaps his loyalty and Listless was doing everything in his power to rebuke their gestures. He had heard stories, tall tales he had thought, of watchers that acted more like custodians, or guardians to their charges, rather than masters. Perhaps he was wrong, and the soothing tales told by forlorn parents to their offspring to give them hope were not just fables to protect their innocence. Or perhaps this was all just a play, some theatrics to amuse them before their cruel reveal. 

Whatever was in store for him, he thought back on the advice the others had given him every time there was a transfer of custody. Look good, speak smart. These were words that had benefited him greatly in the past and as such, he would continue to abide by them.  

So he carefully preened his scales to look as presentable as possible and stepped out of his hovel to be taken to meet this “Sarent”, Lord of the Watchers. 

“There you are, follow me.” The new watcher beckoned Listless to accompany it, and he dutifully obliged. 

As they walked, the new watcher laid out, quite explicitly, what was expected when meeting nobility. It seemed to fall in line with the idea that these people were going to act as conservators, rather than dominators. “I want to make it clear to you, well, Lieb and Royce wanted to make it clear to you, you're not in any trouble. There aren’t going to be any wrong answers. We just need to get an understanding of what you know and don’t know, what you’re good at. A kind of ‘vibe’ check, if you will.”

Listless nodded, “I understand.” He did not.

Before he truly felt ready, he found himself and his new watcher at the threshold of the noble’s domain. It was not at all what he had expected. It was an austere thing, similar to the one he had woken up in, if a not a little bit sturdier. These beings, it seemed, held equality as a principle to be followed and not simply some platitude. 

“Don’t worry,” the new watcher told him, “like I said, it’s just a feeler. It’s all very informal and I’ll make sure Lieb and Royce are here when you’re done.”

So with one deep breath, he prepared himself for whatever lay beyond the precipice and stepped inside, just behind his guide. 

“Corporal Saunders, reporting Sar’n. Brought along our new guest.” The new watcher had become suddenly and unnaturally stiff upon entry.

And Listless could see why. There was a small desk that the Lord of the Watchers rose from. To call him a large man would have been a gross understatement. He was a behemoth, and Listless assumed that was how he rose to his rank. 

“I understand you wished to speak of my abilities?” Listless hesitantly asked. 

“So you’re the stray. I was wondering when you’d be up and about.” Strangely enough, this incredibly sizeable man had an incredibly soft voice, so much so that were he not actively staring at its source, he would have never been able to surmise that *this* was where it came from.  

The Sarent gave a brief nod to the other watcher, “Saunders, you’re free to go. I would like to start by apologizing for your accommodations, it was the best we could scrounge together under the gun. I’ve got a couple of guys from the MEC working on fixing you up with something better.”

There was that word again, “better”. Listless had done nothing in service of these people that would warrant any amount of room and board, let alone them not only apologizing for housing him, but actively trying to improve upon what they had already given. 

The Sarent stared down at Listless. “Yeah, we just want to get a feel for you, nothing formal, you’re under no obligation to answer any questions you’re not comfortable with, alright?”

“Yes.” 

The Sarent grabbed a writing stick and one of the pieces of thin wood, and looked back to Listless. “For starters, can I get your name? Full name if you please.”

“I am Listless Waters, currently of no watcher.” 

The Sarent made an odd motion of its head and hastily scribbled something down. What followed was a series of asinine questions that Listless had no issues answering, where he was from, what the first thing he could remember was, and on. It was all relatively harmless, that was until they arrived at a question that would change the trajectory of his life. 

“Lieb and Royce said that you told them that you were better at less physical tasks, yeah? ‘Not optimized for the field’ were your exact words?”

Listless concurred, “Yes, I was taught script and numbers. Many of my watchers used me as a tally counter or an attendance recorder. I was rarely used for manual labour.”

The Sarent set his writing stick on the table, and gave a warm look to Listless, “Well, that about does it for what we need to know. Just by the looks of it, we could probably get you set up with something fairly safe at the rear, likely in the QM’s or the motor pool, judging by what you know. Looks like you’re going to be ‘currently of no watcher’ from hereon out.”

This didn’t sit right with Listless. Though The Liebowitz and The Royce had done all that they could to impress upon him that he was no longer beholden to any master, he still felt as though he owed them a great debt. It also helped that over their short time together he had grown quite fond of the pair. They had shared with him their foodstuffs, they had told him great tales to calm his nerves, they taught him how to run and survive should they be ambushed, and they had even carried him when he tired. He wished that they would remain his watchers, whether officially, or in spirit only. He needed to formulate a plan that allowed him to remain with the duo. He needed to lie. 

In a stroke of great genius, or more likely great luck, his mind flashed to one of the stories The Liebowitz had regaled him with. The one about the deranged man, clad in all metal, who thought that great structures were monsters of old. The man who had a pudgy helper, who saw through the delusions, yet remained a voice of reason to his master. And Listless came up with a plan.  

“I also acquired squire training.” He quickly added. 

The Sarent looked up from the thin wood, raising a single eyebrow towards him “Squire?”

“Yes,” he quickly fabricated, ‘though it was designated as Warrior Assistant Apprenticeship Training, but I believe ‘squire’ to be much more succinct, yes?” 

“I’m more than a little curious as to where you picked up *that* particular word, but I feel like, at this time, it isn’t worth pressing. I’m *more* curious as to why they would make a bean counter for an apprentice warrior program.” 

Listless swallowed. The Sarent was smart. Of course, he had to be, all high-ranking watchers would need wit of the mind as well as strength of the body. But he, too, was smart, and came up with a ploy of his own. 

“Well, you see,” he began, “Burdens that can think and adapt are valuable commodities. Those are traits that we share with soldiers, and the watchers liked the idea of having others die in their stead.”

“Burdens?” The Sarent asked through gritted teeth. 

“That is what we were called.” Listless was inflectionless; this was simply a statement of fact, a universal truth. “ They named us that, because to them, that’s what we were.”

“I see,” The Sarent’s soft voice had grown even softer. “Well, I don’t want you to think for one second that’s what you are here.” 

There was a moment of silence between the two beings. Listless had never thought of himself as anything other than what his old watchers had called him. He was to them a burden, and he felt as though he would always be so. To hear so explicitly that he was not was only a little bit jarring. 

The Sarent was determined not to let the quiet linger. “But, I don’t really know what you want me to do with this information.”

It seemed that the Sarent had believed his falsehood, so he decided to press his luck, “Well, I was hoping that, perhaps, I could apprentice under the tutelage of The Liebowtiz and The Royce. They are powerful warriors, and perhaps they could instruct me on how to make more of my people, or at least people like me this ‘free.’”

The Sarent stayed quiet for a moment, seemingly trying to decide what to make of this declaration. “You…want to go back out there?”

“Yes.”

The Sarent sighed heavily, “I mean, if you think you’re capable, I could look into it. I would also need you to understand that it would be dangerous, that neither I, nor Lieb, nor Royce could guarantee your safety. There is a decent probability of you being injured or killed.”

Was he really going to go through with this? The watchers at this ‘rear’ surely must be nearly, if not as, kind as The Liebowitz and The Royce. But Listless’ mouth decided to work quicker than his reasoning, “I understand,” he said solemnly.

“Well, it’s up to you, I’ll kick it to the higher-ups, but that's still no guarantee. I need to be clear, that would mean going back out there. Back to where you came from. Seeing the people that were oppressing you before. I need you to be sure that that is what you want.”

Listless knew in his hearts that this would be the hardest challenge that he had ever faced, yet he also knew, for the first time in his life, that this was the most certain he had been about anything. “Yes, I wish to be in the field.”",1,1758329250.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

I understand that some of my components will bottle neck the performance if I upgrade to a more recent card. however, I don’t want to waste my money on an old gen card. 

I’ve seen some talk online of NVIDIA falling off in recent years with certain cards almost being a waste of money. So I’m happy to make the switch to AMD but have no idea how to start that process.

But it was 7:42 five minutes ago. I remember looking at it. The hands haven’t moved. Or maybe I haven’t.

I’m in the kitchen. I don’t remember coming here. There’s a knife in the sink with something smeared along the edge—yellow, maybe red. My hands are wet, dripping, but the faucet isn’t running.

There’s the smell of coffee, sharp and bitter, but no cup, no pot, no sound of dripping water. Just the smell hanging there like smoke.

Something creaks upstairs. Footsteps. I freeze, staring at the ceiling. The sound stops as soon as I notice it. I wait. The silence presses down heavy, buzzing in my ears.

The counters look bare. Too bare. Weren’t there plates? Or cups? The walls look…wrong. The paint, dull and uneven. Did I always live here? For a second, I don’t recognize the room at all.

A chair is in the middle of the floor. I must have pulled it out. But why?

My chest tightens. My pulse hammers. My throat is dry but I don’t dare call out. I’m not alone. I know I’m not.

I go to the hallway mirror. A man stares back at me. His face looks like mine, but something is off—the cheeks hollow, the eyes wide and darting. He looks like prey. His lips move, just barely. I lean closer to hear.

The voice is mine, but not from my throat.
“You don’t belong here.”

The breath leaves my chest in a rush. I stumble back against the wall. The footsteps upstairs start again—slow, deliberate, moving toward the stairs.

And it's getting bigger every single day.

**The Hidden Economic Reality**

Here's what nobody's talking about: when the economy tightens, companies get desperate. Store closures accelerate. Inventory sits longer. Quarterly pressure mounts. The result? A flood of brand-new merchandise hitting liquidation channels at 90% discounts.

Meanwhile, cash-strapped consumers are ditching retail stores for Facebook Marketplace and eBay. They want the same products. Just cheaper.

You sitting in the middle of this equation? That's where fortunes get made.

Shannon showed me the proof:

A $250 floating dock for $3.78.

Blackstone grills for $100 that flip for $400.

Christmas trees for $5 each.

Most people see economic pressure as a problem. You should see it as a business opportunity.

**Corporate Fire Sale**

Here's what happened: Target overbought pool equipment. Warehouses are packed. Christmas inventory is coming and they need space NOW.

Solution? They dump everything to liquidation companies at massive losses.

Shannon pulled up a live auction to show me a Target liquidation. Five pallets of sporting goods.

Ten rigid air docks (Target retail: $250 each)

One 14x42 swimming pool ($450 retail)

Sixty-six pickleball sets

Forty kids' play tunnels

Current bid: $525!!

The manifest should make your heart race. And these kinds of deals are out there every day. Shannon said that it'll sell for under $1,000 for sure.

I did the math. $1,000 investment. 139 total items. Cost per item: $7.19.

Those floating docks alone are worth $2,500 at retail. You only need to sell FOUR at $100 each to get your entire investment back.

Four sales and you’ve got your money back. Everything else is pure profit.

**The Walker Edison Furniture Goldmine**

He then showed me the Walker Edison furniture liquidation site.

Sixteen pallets: Beds, TV consoles, entry tables. All factory sealed.

Current bid: $2,825.

Then Shannon pulled up Facebook Marketplace:

Similar used furniture selling for $200-400 per piece.

This pallet had over 60 pieces.

How to sell it all: ""Build one sample of each piece. Take photos. Post as 'brand new, similar to IKEA' on Facebook Marketplace.""

Total investment after freight: $5,200.

Conservative selling price: $150 per piece average.

Total revenue potential: $9,000+.

Net profit: $3,800 minimum. One weekend's work.

Shannon's student does this every week. Gets pallets Thursday. Lists Friday. Investment back by Sunday.

Furniture is perfect right now. Most people can't afford West Elm prices anymore. But they still need to furnish their homes.

**The Boring Battery Play That Prints Money**

8,000 AA batteries. GP Gold Peak Ultra Plus. Ten-year shelf life.

""Nobody wants batteries,"" Shannon laughed. ""Perfect for us.""

Current auction price: $1 per battery. Amazon retail: $2 per battery. Your wholesale price to local stores: $1.25 each.

Shannon walks into discount stores. Builds relationships with managers. When battery pallets come up, he has ready buyers.

""Every store manager knows 100% of their customers need batteries,"" Shannon explained. ""I'm solving their problem while making 25 cents per unit.""

8,000 units. 25 cents profit each. $2,000 for making phone calls.

**Christmas in July Strategy**

QVC Christmas tree liquidation. Four pallets. 158 artificial trees.

Current bid: $526.

""These will close at under $5 per tree,"" Shannon predicted.

Retail price for similar trees: $60-120 each.

One of Shannon's students bought so many liquidated Christmas trees he's opening a Christmas tree lot this November. Already secured the location.

""Seasonal arbitrage can make you rich,"" Shannon said. ""Buy Christmas in January and July. Halloween in November. Buy when nobody wants it.""

Smart play. Especially when people are looking to save money on holiday decorations.

Exactly what you need if you really want to go all in on this:

* Reseller Certificate: Free in every state. Required for liquidation sites. Shannon's site has all the links: shannonjean.com/resale.
* The Research System: Download every manifest. Research actual selling prices on eBay sold listings. Work backwards to determine your max bid.
* The Bidding Strategy: Bid your max on Friday. Walk away. Don't watch the auction close. ""Weekend auctions sell cheaper because fewer people pay attention.""
* Platform Strategy: Facebook Marketplace for furniture and bulky items. eBay for electronics. Local wholesale for bulk quantities.

**The Sites Shannon Checks Every Morning:**

B-Stock platforms (Target, Costco, Walmart liquidations) and [GovDeals.com](http://GovDeals.com) (government surplus).

His routine: Coffee, scan listings, screenshot company names, ask ChatGPT about recent mergers.

""When companies merge or struggle, liquidations follow,"" Shannon explained. “Focus on getting your investment back fast. Not maximizing profit.""

Example: Buy $3,000 worth of Blackstone grills. Sell three quickly at $400 each. You're even. The remaining grills are pure profit.

This removes fear. Makes decisions clearer. Builds confidence.

**What NOT to Chase:**

Shannon steered me away from the obvious plays. ""Everyone chases iPhones and sneakers. Terrible margins. Competition everywhere.""

What works:

* Furniture (everyone needs it, hard to ship)
* Seasonal items (when in season)
* Batteries and consumables (constant demand)
* Outdoor equipment (Facebook Marketplace gold)
* Home goods (local pickup preferred)

""The sexiest deals are in the most unsexy industries,"" Shannon told me.

**The Opportunity’s There:**

Economic pressure creates a perfect storm. More companies liquidating inventory. More consumers shopping secondhand platforms. The gap between wholesale liquidation prices and retail demand is widening every month.

Three things keep most people out:

* They don't know these sites exist
* Successful buyers don't brag about it
* It requires actual work (research, pickup, listing, selling)

Your Next Move:

* Get your reseller certificate
* Study Shannon's recommended sites
* Download manifests and research prices
* Start with small bids to learn
* Focus on getting investment back quickly

Every day you wait, someone else is buying these deals. Building relationships with liquidation companies. Learning which products move fast in this new economy.

Most people will read this and do nothing. They'll think about it. Research it. Maybe bookmark some sites. Meanwhile, you could get your free reseller certificate this week. Place your first bid Monday. Have product delivered Wednesday. Start pulling in cash from the hidden economy.

The question isn't whether this works. Shannon proved it works. His students prove it works. It works every day. The question is whether you'll capitalize on the biggest arbitrage opportunity of our economic cycle.

I recently had my first child a month ago and I have been tricking myself that I could be a great dad and casual drinker.

My amazing wife was getting ready to take her first solo trip out of the house for a yoga class…instead she walked into our bar catching me pouring some whiskey into my 10 am coffee.  I’ll never forget the look of horror and disappointment on her face when she saw me. 

Instead of flipping out on me, we sat and talked and created a plan on how to move forward.  I dumped over   3k worth of booze right down the drain and it felt like such a relief.

Ive been sick of this back and forth of dipping my toes in the sober pool…I fall in love with it but then I’m tricked by the warm water and feel like I’m cured after a few days and go back to my drinking self. 

This time has to be different.  I want this to be my rock bottom…I know I didn’t get a dui or end up in the hospital…but I could have easily have gotten drunk today and recklessly driven my kid around. 

I tried a meeting tonight but didn’t love the online vibe or the attendees that showed up.  I going to try an in person meeting tomorrow to try and find a home group.

1nljtdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conan/comments/1nljtdr/lets_start_fighting_backcollectively/,Let’s Start Fighting Back—Collectively,"here’s what we’re gonna do to finally start fighting back — and make companies choose our values or feel the heat:

we’re building a member-powered platform, under a (c)(4) framework, that pools small monthly dues (think coffee money) to fund aggressive, year-round campaigns — AND collects the zero-party info members willingly share about their finances, spending habits, social reach, & workplace procurement influence, etc  

when you add up those small recurring fees, plus the volunteered data on who controls what dollars & who influences which budgets, you get real, measurable collective leverage — consumer, B2B, & financial market pressure, all in one toolbox.

this isn’t just a platform. it’s the central node of a distributed execution network. we’re aggregating individual influence and transforming it into massive, targeted collective power that can be executed instantly across channels:

- boycotts
- buycotts
- divestments
- procurement pressure
- direct demands
- litigation (by leveraging our associational standing & member demo mapping) 

you name it. members vote, the network acts.

how it actually works:

• members pay a small monthly membership fee that funds the (c)(4)’s sustained message ops, ad buys, associational litigation, etc

• you voluntarily share rough, consented data — spending/income ranges, whether you control procurement or influence buying at work, retirement/brokerage control, follower counts, typical post reach. this is zero-party: power you give us to use together.

• we aggregate that into an action score: consumer spend, procurement impact, investable leverage, and narrative reach. that tells us where a campaign will actually move markets and minds.

• the (c)(4) runs relentless, multi-channel narrative ops — sharable daily messaging, targeted paid + organic buys, plus linear/radio when needed — and rapid oppo playbooks that flip opponents’ own lines back on them.

we’ll be aggressive, smart, and legally tight: year-round persuasion and surgical targeting so ideas change permanently, not just for a headline cycle. this is organized persuasion backed by real economic leverage.

the other piece — the story war:

we’ll run constant, multi-channel narrative ops

• daily narrative-packets: we’ll create short, loosely structured shareable messaging packets that members post in their own voice to their own accounts — platform-optimized, frictionless, AI customized & timed so the same narrative lands across feeds/timelines. this is an updated version of the GOP’s highly effective “talking points of the day” playbook they used to enforce message discipline, for the social age

• coordinated organic + paid: those packets are amplified with surgical paid buys (social, programmatic, streaming) so the message isn’t just trending among pockets — it runs everywhere the public actually sees it.

• collective voice campaigns: we’ll run directed CTAs — ask members to tag accounts, post hashtags, reply to key posts, or boost specific narratives at set windows so organic signals look authentic & powerful. this isn’t bot spam, it’s organized, human amplification at scale

• flip & reframe ops: we design rapid oppo playbooks that don’t just attack — they flip opponents’ themes back at them, weaponizing their own self-image and talking points so their base hears the contradiction from inside their story.

• rapid testing & measurement: constant A/B tests, focus pilots, and analytics so we know what actually shifts opinions, not just racks up impressions. every campaign is iterated until it moves the needle.

we’re not doing polite persuasion once every two years. this is year-round narrative engineering + economic leverage — a living, responsive system that can force institutions to choose: align with progressive values or feel the collective consequence

if you wanna turn the influence you already control (job, investments, social reach) into an actual execution network that wins the story war & the market war — this is how. we build the tools. you bring the power. together we make them pick a side!

So, if you’re done with performative outrage & want your money, your job influence, your retirement assets, & your social reach to be part of a functioning execution network that actually forces institutions to choose — join the first wave. share, amplify, chip in—if you can! 

any amount helps, the more we raise the faster we can bring this vision to fruition

we build. we organize. we make companies pick a side. ready to stop yelling and start winning?

1nljssi,https://i.redd.it/p3d3urcko7qf1.jpeg,Be aware. Greg Haitz is one of Cody Kennedy’s cronies,"  
Greg Haitz Runs for Treasurer to Keep the Real Estate Party Rolling

GRAND JUNCTION, CO — In a stunning move that surprises exactly no one, chiropractor-turned-politician Greg Haitz is throwing his hat in the ring for Mesa County Treasurer — not for the taxpayers, not for the people, but for his real estate buddies like Mayor Cody Kennedy and developer Thom Copp.

Haitz, known for passionately handing out vaccine misinformation like Halloween candy and for his anti-vax crusades, apparently thinks managing the county’s money is just another way to grease the wheels for his landlord pals’ ever-expanding property empires.“He’s not doing this for himself,” whispered an insider between sips of overpriced coffee at a developer brunch. “Greg’s the guy who keeps the landlord clique happy, making sure the tax rates and fees stay just right for Kennedy, Copp, and the usual suspects.”

More Than Just Treasurer

While most candidates promise fiscal responsibility and transparency, Haitz’s platform could be summarized as:“Let’s keep the cash flowing to the folks who already own the valley — and keep the public busy chasing conspiracy theories.”

His track record includes:

Running for office twice and losing but somehow ending up cozy on the Mesa County Planning Commission.

Spreading dubious health claims alongside his political ambitions — apparently, managing taxpayer dollars and vaccine misinformation go hand in hand.

Selectively attending only friendly political forums, because why debate when you can dictate?

What This Means for Grand Junction

If elected, Haitz will oversee the county’s finances in a way that likely ensures:

Favorable property tax policies for landlords already cashing in on Grand Junction’s tight housing market.

Taxpayer dollars moving quietly in ways that benefit the Kennedy-Haitz-Copp real estate axis.

A steady supply of distraction via misinformation campaigns, keeping public scrutiny focused on everything but the swelling rental prices and zoning giveaways.

Public ReactionSome residents are alarmed, others just exhausted. Councilor Scott Beilfuss called the run “a perfect storm of cronyism and conspiracy theories.” Haitz, meanwhile, continues to ignore calls for transparency, preferring instead to share “alternative facts” on social media and in local gatherings.

Base fully built, near infinite food/supplies, best armor/weapons, etc. I don't especially like RPing or making up my own stories or whatever, so I kinda went meh, uninstalled, and happy to get my moneys worth 10x over.

Picked up Zomboid again, and similarly (I guess like many sandbox games), love the early to mid-game struggle, but then get to point like many of us do where survival is no longer an issue and most of the time is spent figuring out where to put your 200 cans of --- and 500 magazines I pick up for no reason. My favorite description of this is ""The Sims with more steps.""

  
After trolling around older posts of ""bored at endgame, what do I do?"" and seeing the standard suggestions across most sandboxes (mod it, up the difficulty, make your own goals, etc.) I found none of them really worked for me.

  
Got to thinking, how can we make Zomboid have the same replayability (in other ways) like popular roguelikes (Slay the Spire, Against the Storm, They are Billions, etc.)? 

  
My idea: a mode where you only have to survive \~40 days. Maybe every 10 days or so is a meta event (helicopter or 'horde night'). At day 40, you need to get to an extraction point (shoutout to 'Wolf's'). Any cash you picked up is used to buy loot/skill upgrades for your next character. More advanced, maybe a ""wealth factor"" of your base also gives you $$. Rinse and repeat, but each new run ups the difficulty (harder/more frequent meta events, rarer loot, weather, so on.) Sure I could *kind* of do this manually...but a dedicated mode would be great, and a sense of progression and direction.

  
Now just need a talented modder to make it, I'll buy 3 coffees! Back to dying, cheers.

It if unfortunately kinda fragile and extremely prone to breaking if not reinforced with rods in the inside (I've only soldered the pieces togheter and that seemed to have worked for the blade, although the handle is a whole different story and will be hard to try to keep togheter without tons of hot glue).

I’ve mentioned Larry before. However, Beth was no picnic either. Both Larry and Beth fought tooth and nail, and I overheard a lot of their nonsense. 

Larry is basically Shrek. His workspace was a disgusting mess, and he had a nasty habit of burping and farting out loud in his cube next to me. He would aggressively blow his nose, and I thought a train was going by outside. He spit a loogie out my car window, and I almost dumped his ass in the middle of downtown Toronto, and made him take the bus the rest of the way. He blew up a can of Coca Cola in the freezer, which looked like explosive diarrhea all over the rest of the food. His actions got so bad, my team lead and I decided to clean up his workspace ourselves. He had worn off the letters of his keyboard and I was afraid to touch his mouse. Being around Larry made my contamination OCD even worse. He would leave empty pop cans and big gulp cups on the desk and leave rings. There was a coffee stain on the carpet. We had to throw away his chair. 

He was mad the next day after the big clean-up, and sat in his cube and pouted like a little kid. He got a slap on the wrist and was told something to the effect that the office is a shared space and he needs to be more considerate of others and company property. I have a high tolerance for gross-out guys being guys stuff, but Larry took it too far. I smacked my forehead 10 times a day at the filthy stuff he did every day! 

Beth came in to work on a different team and was placed in our section of the office for some reason. That was red flag number one. At first she seemed fine, but we quickly learned that she had a short fuse and a foul mouth. Larry was her nemesis with his loud and annoying habits. 

Larry always had junk food and snacks; bags of chips, Timbits, breakfast burritos, jumbo iced coffees. He ate and drank constantly (and loudly). One day, he crinkled his bag of chips and started munching. Beth shouted over her cube for him to shut up. Oh no, this is not going to end well…

With Larry’s junk food addiction, he obviously  had stomach problems and frequent flatulence. One day he ripped a gnarly fart, and the whole hallway heard Beth groan and curse at him. “Aww s**t what’s wrong with you?!” Finally someone calling Larry out on his nasty habits lol! The next day, Beth brought in an air freshener to perch on the wall between her and Larry’s cubes. Great, now the office smells like a delicate mix of Hawaiian breeze and sour fart cloud, yuck!

Beth always complained and was as rude and obnoxious as Larry. One day there was an altercation which culminated with Larry flipping Beth off. I don’t know the whole story, but it involved Larry’s birthday cake, which Beth said tasted like battery acid. Beth taped up an Ed, Edd, n Eddy cartoon character labeled “Larry” in his cube. She taped up a picture of Ms. Piggy in another girl’s cube. The whole office quickly began to hate her. Larry just added fuel to her fire. My cube location was like being in Poland in 1939. It stressed me out so much. 

The s**t hit the fan when we found out Beth was saving files on her PC that her team needed. She had a bad habit of hoarding important data and refusing to share the locations on the local drives. One of her teammates approached her about this, and she went nuclear. She cussed out a colleague who I liked and called her fat (the pot calling the kettle black). Larry butted in and chewed Beth out. I walked away and discovered the next day that delusional, psychotic Beth got canned.

1nljemn,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nljemn/the_most_underrated_morning_habit_drinking_water/,The most underrated morning habit? Drinking water,"I've been on something of a quest lately, attempting to streamline my mornings, increase my concentration, and generally feel less like a zombie before 10 AM. Like many of you, I've experimented with all the ""ideal morning routine"" fads: the 5 AM club, meditating, hour-long journaling, cold showers, complicated smoothie recipes. name it, and I've likely tried it (and likely failed at it after a few days, let's be real).

My mornings went something like this for years: alarm goes off (or gets hit repeatedly as I snooze again and again), I roll out of bed groggily, coffee is grabbed almost immediately, and I dive straight into emails, social media, and the general chaos of my day. I always felt so parched, sluggish, and like my brain was only half-functional despite that first caffeine buzz.

Then, six months ago, I stumbled upon something so incredibly simple, I was going to dismiss it. It is not high-tech, does not require expensive equipment, and it takes one minute flat.

I started drinking one big glass of water, like, a really big one, 16-20 ounces, immediately after waking up, before anything else. Before coffee, before checking my phone, before even thinking about breakfast.

And for real? It's literally not dumb-simple, but it's completely changed how I wake feeling alert, awake, and energized. It's as if my mind gets a subtle ""wake-up call"" that the coffee can't match. My digestion is improved, I'm not so likely to experience that middle-morning drag, and I have an honest sense of clarity that I previously didn't. It sets my day off on a good foot, like a compact, effective ritual.

I know we're all looking for those tricks and hacks, but sometimes it's the things that are downright simple that have the biggest impact.

By the way, I shared more details about this on

Has anyone else noticed small, seemingly insignificant changes like this that have had a mind-boggling gigantic impact on their daily life or health? I'd love to know what ""dumb-simple"" habits have worked wonders for you!

I'm deep in the SEO learning grind courses, certs, you name it and sometimes it feels like you're just throwing strategies into a black box, hoping Google notices.

But then it happens. You check your tracking tool, you search incognito, and there it is: your site. On page one. Maybe even in the coveted #1 spot.

That first tangible win is a feeling like no other. It's the moment theory becomes practice and all the effort finally pays off.

So, to inspire myself and everyone else who's still climbing the learning curve:

What was your first ""big"" ranking achievement?

What was the keyword? No need to give away your golden goose, even something like ""best coffee mugs for programmers"" counts
How long had you been working on it?
What was the strategy that you think finally pushed it over the edge? e.g., ""I finally nailed the title tag,"" ""I built my first real backlink,"" ""I actually updated my content for once.""
How did it feel?

Apologies in advance for the novel that follows :P

A while ago I asked a co-worker of mine out to coffee. We worked at a boutique clothing store...she's the women's sales manager and I was a regular sales rep. She is a few years older than me...I am in my late 20's she's in her early 30's.  Although from very different backgrounds we shared similar interests in music, and although she is VERY introverted she seemed comfortable talking to me.  

We would often close shop together where it would be just the two of us for a few hours and on days where it was quiet we'd just stand around and chat.  She opened up about how she grew up, her family, personal dramas etc and I was happy to listen.  

I want to stress that when I say she is introverted I really mean it.  Not necessarily socially inept because she was more than capable of carrying on a conversation with customers when she needed to and had a quiet sense of humour...but at the end of the day she's the kind of person that would very rarely ever initiate a conversation with anyone and it was a going joke amongst the rest of the team that she really kept to herself. 

To put it even more plainly...she's the kind of person that PREFERRED living in lockdown during Covid when everyone else was complaining about feeling lonely, isolated etc.  

I wasn't particularly attracted to her at first but as time passed on especially as we spent more time closing shop together and I learned more about her I developed feelings for her which eventually turned into a really strong crush...the kind where almost everything a person does is attractive and pulls at your heartstrings. 

All of this took place at the beginning of the year.  I was planning on leaving the job in the summer to travel and did not have plans to return. So on one of the shifts we had closing together I asked her if she would like to grab coffee before I left...though she seemed a little surprised she said yes and i did not get the sense she was saying yes simply because she was being put on the spot...she seemed pleasantly surprised. 

I did not bring it up again for a few days as I did not want to pressure her...nor did I act ANY different with her at work as I did not want her to feel uncomfortable or make her worry that other employees might think something was going on between us. 

After a little while I texted her letting her know that as her schedule was busier than mine I was free to grab coffee at a time that worked best for her. 

She did not respond. 

I was not entirely put off by her lack of response as I chalked it up to her introversion and didn't bring it up with her for a few more days.  However after a little while I jokingly said to her ""hey I hope my text to you about grabbing coffee didn't put you on the spot"" to which she replied ""no"" without really elaborating before simply saying ""see you tomorrow"". 

I dropped it after that simply assuming that the opportunity to bring it up again would come naturally closer to when I left. I don't know if at this point I subconsciously acted different around her but i got the sense that she was distancing herself from me. She'd be perfectly fine chatting if I instigated a conversation but would often busy herself with other stuff after a while in a way she wouldn't have before. 

More stark was the fact that during shifts where we would close together we'd no longer sit around and chat like we used to and she would busy herself with work even when the shop was empty. To be fair the GM had emphasized to us that we could use free time when the shop was quiet to get other work done and so she may have felt the pressure to do that as a sales manager. 

The next time I brought up getting coffee with her she was a lot more reserved and said she would think about it. 

I texted her not long after that apologizing if I'd done anything to make her uncomfortable but that I liked her and was simply happy for the chance to hang out and get to know her more. 

After a few more days (bearing in mind that this is now just a few weeks from my last day) she told me she did not think it would be appropriate without elaborating further. 

The next time we closed together I asked her as we left if it was because of anything I did or if it was because we worked together and she said it was just how she felt to which I responded that I totally understood and left it at that. 

For the remainder of my time there our interacting was practically non-existent beyond what was necessary for work and the occasional pleasantry. 

I realized then how much I liked this girl cause it really bothered me but not wanting to make her uncomfortable I left it.

Then on my last day she, myself and one other coworker who I also got along with well closed together. They had put together a little goody bag of candies and a card for me included in which was a bag of candy I'm sure had been handpicked by her as it was an inside joke between the two of us and not a popular brand of candy that someone else would have arbitrarily picked. Whereas before she seemed to be avoiding me on this last day she seemed warmer, laughed at my jokes and gave me a really heartfelt smile when I said goodbye. 

I texted her once during the summer while I was gone asking if she'd like anything for me to bring back...she did not respond but i can see that she read it at close to 1:00 AM in the morning. 

I've since travelled in the summer and am back home now and have been in the store to say hi a few times to the team and chat.  She doesn't come over to say hi but will smile when she seems me and will reciprocate conversation if I start it. 

I realize this is a LOT to make over simply getting coffee with someone but (1) I really liked her and (2) I genuinely don't understand what would have caused her to change her mind. I'm also completely flummoxed at the lack of communication and don't know if I should chalk it up to introversion and anxiety or extreme disinterest? She is a soft spoken, kind, reserved but not rude so I'm a little at a lost of what to make of it...part of me is still holding out hope that I might one day ask her out again but i don't want to creep her out or make her feel uncomfortable.

Have been going to dermatologists, allergists, etc. and I started a whole30 elimination diet on August 11th. Within 4-5 days of starting the diet my knees and elbows started clearing up significantly. I have now started reintroducing food groups one at a time (and going back to whole30 between to monitor for a reaction). 

Today I attempted to introduce non-gluten grains and landed on oats, quinoa, and rice for the three I would try first because I ate those the most frequently before. I ate GF oatmeal for breakfast with homemade oat milk in my coffee and within an hour developed a rash/hives in the crease of my elbows, behind one of my knees, and on my neck where my eczema typically would flare before. Super weird as I used to drink oat milk every day. I ate a bit of quinoa for lunch and didn’t notice any worsening symptoms. Then for dinner I ate rice with my meal and within minutes started breaking out into hives on my face, neck, arms, elbows, and behind my knees. 

So I guess based on this (obviously from my own assessment not a medical professional’s standpoint) I’ve had pretty clear reactions to both oats and rice. Is anyone else on here allergic to those things??? Is this normal????",4,1758325276.0,eczema,2,1.0,False

I wasn't particularly attracted to her at first but as time passed on especially as we spent more time closing shop together and I learned more about her I developed feelings for her which eventually turned into a really strong crush...the kind where almost everything a person does is attractive and pulls at your heartstrings. 

All of this took place at the beginning of the year.  I was planning on leaving the job in the summer to travel and did not have plans to return. So on one of the shifts we had closing together I asked her if she would like to grab coffee before I left...though she seemed a little surprised she said yes and i did not get the sense she was saying yes simply because she was being put on the spot...she seemed pleasantly surprised. 

I did not bring it up again for a few days as I did not want to pressure her...nor did I act ANY different with her at work as I did not want her to feel uncomfortable or make her worry that other employees might think something was going on between us. 

After a little while I texted her letting her know that as her schedule was busier than mine I was free to grab coffee at a time that worked best for her. 

She did not respond. 

I was not entirely put off by her lack of response as I chalked it up to her introversion and didn't bring it up with her for a few more days.  However after a little while I jokingly said to her ""hey I hope my text to you about grabbing coffee didn't put you on the spot"" to which she replied ""no"" without really elaborating before simply saying ""see you tomorrow"". 

I dropped it after that simply assuming that the opportunity to bring it up again would come naturally closer to when I left. I don't know if at this point I subconsciously acted different around her but i got the sense that she was distancing herself from me. She'd be perfectly fine chatting if I instigated a conversation but would often busy herself with other stuff after a while in a way she wouldn't have before. 

More stark was the fact that during shifts where we would close together we'd no longer sit around and chat like we used to and she would busy herself with work even when the shop was empty. To be fair the GM had emphasized to us that we could use free time when the shop was quiet to get other work done and so she may have felt the pressure to do that as a sales manager. 

The next time I brought up getting coffee with her she was a lot more reserved and said she would think about it. 

I texted her not long after that apologizing if I'd done anything to make her uncomfortable but that I liked her and was simply happy for the chance to hang out and get to know her more. 

After a few more days (bearing in mind that this is now just a few weeks from my last day) she told me she did not think it would be appropriate without elaborating further. 

The next time we closed together I asked her as we left if it was because of anything I did or if it was because we worked together and she said it was just how she felt to which I responded that I totally understood and left it at that. 

For the remainder of my time there our interacting was practically non-existent beyond what was necessary for work and the occasional pleasantry. 

I realized then how much I liked this girl cause it really bothered me but not wanting to make her uncomfortable I left it.

Then on my last day she, myself and one other coworker who I also got along with well closed together. They had put together a little goody bag of candies and a card for me included in which was a bag of candy I'm sure had been handpicked by her as it was an inside joke between the two of us and not a popular brand of candy that someone else would have arbitrarily picked. Whereas before she seemed to be avoiding me on this last day she seemed warmer, laughed at my jokes and gave me a really heartfelt smile when I said goodbye. 

I texted her once during the summer while I was gone asking if she'd like anything for me to bring back...she did not respond but i can see that she read it at close to 1:00 AM in the morning. 

I've since travelled in the summer and am back home now and have been in the store to say hi a few times to the team and chat.  She doesn't come over to say hi but will smile when she seems me and will reciprocate conversation if I start it. 

I realize this is a LOT to make over simply getting coffee with someone but (1) I really liked her and (2) I genuinely don't understand what would have caused her to change her mind. I'm also completely flummoxed at the lack of communication and don't know if I should chalk it up to introversion and anxiety or extreme disinterest? She is a soft spoken, kind, reserved but not rude so I'm a little at a lost of what to make of it...part of me is still holding out hope that I might one day ask her out again but i don't want to creep her out or make her feel uncomfortable.

I'm divorced. Been divorced for 14 years, but always been very close to my ex and sometimes intimate etc.

Around 5 years ago we were extremely close and I thought it was very possible we would get back together, but life threw a few obstacles between us. Last Christmas I told her that I wanted more from the relationship and she agreed she would spend more time with me and go away on trips etc.

In January I had a heart attack and she let me stay there a few days to recover, but we had a massive row, mostly about our eldest son, who lives with me and needs a lot of support. I was unhappy about the lack of input she has with him.

Anyway, we weren't communicating as often after that and long story short she met a new guy. I only found out 4 weeks ago and she said they had only been for a coffee and one meal, but the things she said made it obvious to me that it had been going on for longer. She was saying things like ""it wasn't planned, she didn't look for it, he makes her happy and she's going to see where it goes"" 

I took it pretty bad, because only in May she was suggesting we go away to Europe for a Christmas Market break.

  
Now she's saying she doesn't know why I'm taking it badly, that we were just friends and she'd made it quite clear we would never get back together etc.

Anyway those aren't the sort of things you say if you've just had a coffee with someone.

I found a photo of them together and she was really comfortable with him. They were on a day out and they were just wearing casual clothes, so well past the dressed to impress stage.

I saw photographs yesterday of them away in a hotel. Chocolates, champagne, flowers. Hot tub overlooking beautiful scenery. Everything I wanted to do with her and that she had agreed to.

I couldn't help it. I did some amateur sleuthing and the hotel they were staying at costs £2000 for the weekend.

The longest she could have possibly known this guy is 4 months flat because she met him at the care home where her uncle was living out his last days. He's the manager there.

Anyway, I could never afford that for a weekend and she has obviously well and truely moved on and rewrote history so she can start again with this new guy. We were much closer than what she is making out, but that doesn't matter anyway.

What I've really come here to ask, is how do I stop myself from peeking at their social media because I'm dying to know where they're going and what they're doing, but I know it's wrong and none of my business, but I get bad cravings to do it. It hurts like hell aswell. I don;t know why I torture myself.

I'm doing the whole no contact thing and that's the hardest part for me so far. I'm dying to see what they're up to now, as I type this post.

Apologies in advance for the novel that follows :P

A while ago I asked a co-worker of mine out to coffee. We worked at a boutique clothing store...she's the women's sales manager and I was a regular sales rep. She is a few years older than me...I am in my late 20's she's in her early 30's.  Although from very different backgrounds we shared similar interests in music, and although she is VERY introverted she seemed comfortable talking to me.  

We would often close shop together where it would be just the two of us for a few hours and on days where it was quiet we'd just stand around and chat.  She opened up about how she grew up, her family, personal dramas etc and I was happy to listen.  

I want to stress that when I say she is introverted I really mean it.  Not necessarily socially inept because she was more than capable of carrying on a conversation with customers when she needed to and had a quiet sense of humour...but at the end of the day she's the kind of person that would very rarely ever initiate a conversation with anyone and it was a going joke amongst the rest of the team that she really kept to herself.

- please do not litter! there are garbage cans on many street corners. hold onto ur trash until u can toss it nicely!
- i do not recommend driving in. the street parking is crazy limited and garages upcharge for concert nights. instead, consider taking the subway 🎵 or LIRR! if ur staying outside the city/live elsewhere, take metro north or NJT to grand central or penn station and take the LIRR to forest hills from there! both it and the subway are safe and affordable
- BE CAREFUL CROSSING QUEENS BOULEVARD! dont look at your phone when crossing. be quick. that highway sucks ass and ive had a couple of close calls
- walk fast, don't take up the whole sidewalk, and pay attention to where you are stepping!
- we have tons of local coffee shops (red pipes and pink forest are my faves), so forgo the starbucks and dunkin when u visit 
- the nightlife in forest hills leaves a lot to be desired. i recommend taking the train to LIC, sunnyside, or the city. there's a new bar here called iykyk, but i havent been so i can't vouch but i have heard decent things!

Both are also non human (Mordecai and Rigby being animals and McQueen and Mater being Vehicles) but at the same time from different species (McQueen being a race Car Mater being a Tow Truck Mordecai being a Bluejay and Rigby being a Raccoon), They also love stuff to the point they are skilled (Videogames, Karaoke, Slacking and Drinking Coffee while Mater loves driving backwards and cracking jokes and the variety of stuff he does in Cars Toons while McQueen loves races, McQueen being a champion of the Piston Cup, Mater being the best driver backwards and Mordo and Riggs breaking a Universal Record at Videogames), Both also have a green mean rival (Muscle Man and Chick Hicks) who ended having opposite relationships with them (Muscle Man warming up to them and becoming friendlier while Chick stayed as arrogant). They also have their own catchphrases (OOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!/KA-CHOW! and If I'm Lyin' I'm Cryin'!). Also sometimes the dumbness or recklessness of Rigby & Mater gets their friends in trouble and they despite being dumb have moments of brilliance. They also have a lot of adventures together including doing a catchy Rock song together (Mater and Lightning with Dadgum and Mordecai and Rigby with Party Tonight). Both are competitive towards each other (Mater and Lightning racing and Mordecai and Rigby with the punchies or videogames) also they know a secret spy who faces antagonists (Thomas & Finn McMissile), Also they are from teams of other supportive characters (The Park and Radiator Springs). The places got an ancient founder who ended having a statue for themselves (Mr. Maellard and Stanlee), they also got a Big Bro who solves their trouble (Skips & Mac, Skips being wise enough to solve Mordo and Riggs trouble and Mac transporting Lightning to his races). Both also got another duo of besties who support them (Luigi and Guido and Muscle Man and Fives), Also there is a memeable lovable character who is known for their charisma who is a friendly rival to them being confident arrogant and competitive (Francesco and Muscle Man). Also both of their series are known for seeming grounded but if researching them further they have insaner feats (Cars Tunes making Mater do stuff like traveling back in time and McQueen surviving eatmospheric re entry Regular Show Comics making Mordo and Riggs face reality enders like Lord Destruction and Monster of Infinity and surviving the Power of the Timenado which can end all of space time) and both shows have cool songs including real songs added (Life is a Highway and many 80s songs for Regular Show). Also both have a lot of abilities that makes them unpredictable (Mordecai and Rigby with the Death Known Do skills, Fists of Justice, Infinite lifes, Videogame arsenal and Reality warping stuff like The Power and Realm of Darthon Lightning McQueen with his many weaponry and Nitro Boosts and Personalizations and same for Mater and both duos being able to travel through time) Both also have an enemy who is known for their strength and will to beat up anyone their way (Frank and The Hammer).",1,1758324555.0,DeathBattleMatchups,1,0.6,False

1nlircl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlircl,Send link? My Stepbrother Wants Me (Harriet and Darin),"Chapter 1
For 20 years, Harriet Foley was the pampered daughter of the Foley family. It ended when Aurora Foley showed up with a DNA report.
That's when Harriet learned she wasn't their real daughter but had been mixed up at the hospital.
She couldn't face the Foleys and packed up to leave. But Darin Foley stopped her and carried her into his car by force.
Darin was cold to her since they were young, though they were siblings at that time. But that night, Darin pinned her to the couch and forced Harriet to orgasm three times.
Harriet's voice was hoarse from crying. Darin gripped her waist and whispered in her ear, ""I've been longing for this for a long time.""
Finally, Harriet understood.
Darin kept his distance from her was just because he had to hide his wild desire toward her.
In no time, Darin announced their engagement regardless of everyone's objections.
Their parents, Troy and Selena Foley, tried to stop Darin, resulting in a power grab and leaving Darin the only person in charge of the Foley family.
Aurora caused a big scene. So Darin suspended all of her cards and threatened to send her back to her former family.
Meanwhile, Harriet couldn't accept Darin as she only saw him as her brother. She tried to escape time after time. But every time, Darin found her and brought her home.
She felt like she couldn't leave this wide dragnet.
Her chance came half a month ago. Darin left home at midnight to buy Harriet desserts and had a car accident.
When he woke up...he had amnesia.
The Foleys were overjoyed. They told Darin that Harriet was just a maid in the house, not a word about how madly in love he was.
The Foleys only wanted to send Harriet away before Darin regained his memory.
""We give you 15 million dollars.""
Troy and Selena eagerly slid the check over. ""Now it's the best timing. Darin doesn't remember you. You'd better take the money and go. We raised you. If you're grateful, please never show up in Darin's life again. And don't let him find you.""
After a long silence, Harriet spoke.
""OK. I'll leave the country in two weeks and never return.""
Although she was holding the thin check in her hand, the past year felt like an unreal and absurd dream to her.
The Foleys wanted her gone. She wanted to leave, too.
Darin had treated her like a princess this year, giving her everything she wanted but freedom. But Harriet couldn't stand this kind of suffocating love.
As Darin had forgotten about her, this was her only chance to escape.
""What are you doing?""
The door opened, and Darin was standing there. Aurora was behind him.
He looked handsome in his pressed suit. His presence brought a silent pressure to everyone in the room. The air stilled.
Both Troy and Selena paused a second before smiling, flattering, ""Nothing. We're telling the maid what to do.""
Selena nudged Troy and forced a smile. ""We're going upstairs for a nap now.""
Before she left, she shot Harriet a warning glare.
Harriet kept her eyes low and clenched the check in her hand. When she turned to return to the servant's room...
""Stop.""
Darin's voice was as cold as ice.
Harriet stopped dead. She didn't dare to raise her head. Her heart nearly jumped out of her throat.
His footsteps were getting closer. One second later, Darin gripped Harriet's chin, forcing her to make eye contact. His eyes were dark like two bottomless abysses.
Harriet's breath caught. Scenes of Darin pressing her to the window, the bed, even the kitchen counter flashed through her head.
Darin's thumb caressed her chin, his gaze cold. ""What's the perfume you're wearing?""
Harriet opened her mouth, but Darin didn't let her answer.
""Don't wear it again."" He dropped his hand, his tone filled with disdain. ""You're just a maid. Do your job. Stop thinking about seducing others.""
Harriet balled her fists.
Darin used to love to bury his nose in her neck. He asked with a low laugh, ""What's your perfume? It smells great.""
Harriet shook her head. ""I'm not wearing any perfume.""
Darin bit her earlobe and chuckled, his voice husky. ""You smell great then. Harriet, every part of you attracts me. Don't you dare leave me. I'll follow you and bring you home wherever you go. Understand?""
Harriet thought she could never escape Darin. But fate had given her a chance...
Certainly, Harriet wouldn't argue with Darin or try to explain. She merely nodded. ""Yes, Mr. Foley.""
When Darin left and headed to his study, Harriet heaved a sigh of relief. She planned to return to her room and start packing. But Aurora strode over and slapped her.
""Harriet! Do you have no shame?!"" Aurora shrieked. ""Darin had been tricked by you once. But he has no memories of you now. How could you still get his attention?!
""Listen. Darin has found a fiancée!"" Aurora smirked. ""The engagement will be announced soon. She's a hundred times better than you!""
Harriet's body stiffened.
A fiancée?
Of course. Darin didn't remember her. With the Foley family's wealth and position, women would die to marry him.
But it was not her concern.
Aurora was determined to punish her. She yelled, ""Guards. Take this woman to the freezer! She needs to learn to keep her hands off Darin!""
The bodyguards exchanged looks. None of them dared to move.
They all had seen how protective of Harriet Darin was.
Once, a business partner touched Harriet. Just one touch, and his hand was on Darin's desk the next day.
Aurora was shaking in anger. ""Darin doesn't remember her anymore! She's not Ms. Foley or the future Mrs. Foley anymore! What are you afraid of?!""
She pointed at the guards. ""Take her or you're all fired!""
The bodyguards still looked reluctant.
The door of the study opened with a loud noise.
With a frown, Darin asked, ""What's the ruckus?""
Aurora flashed him a flattering smile. ""Darin, Harriet couldn't do her job. So, I want to lock her in the freezer as punishment. But the guards wouldn't do it!""
Darin glanced at the guards, his voice dark. ""What did she promise you guys? How dare you disobey your employer?""
When he looked at Harriet, his gaze was full of distaste. ""Drag her away. She's an eye sore.""
Then, he closed the door forcefully.
Darin's order cleared the guards' doubt.
Harriet closed her eyes and let the guards haul her out without a fight.
Since she was little, she wasn't good with colds. So, Darin had made sure the mansion stayed warm at all times.
At night, her hands and legs would feel like ice. And Darin would lower himself to hold her feet to his chest to warm them.
But this time, he had ordered the guards to lock Harriet in the freezer.
The cold pierced Harriet to the bone. She squatted down at a corner and hugged her legs tightly. Soon, she started to lose consciousness.
She thought, ""It's alright. Just bear with it.
""I'm going to leave here soon.""
Soon, she could be...Harriet Foley again, not Darin's property anymore.
As Harriet was about to black out, she heard someone shouting her name frantically.
""Harriet!""
A man ran into the freezer and collected Harriet into his trembling arms.
Chapter 2
When Harriet opened her eyes again, all she saw was the blinding white of the hospital.
""Harriet, how do you feel? Are you still in pain anywhere?""
A familiar voice reached her ears, followed by a gentle face in front of her.
Vincent was sitting beside her bed. All the red veins in his eyes showed that he must have been keeping watch for a long time.
""...Vincent?""
Memories before she fainted started to flood into her head. ""You saved me?"" she asked while forcing herself to sit up.
Vincent nodded. His voice was still shaking with fear, ""I kept calling you, but couldn't get through. When I rushed to the Foley's villa, I heard you'd been locked in the walk-in freezer...""
Before he could finish, live news suddenly popped up on TV.
""The Foley family and the Cobb Group have officially announced their union. Mr. Darin Foley and Ms. Lenore Cobb will hold their wedding next month...""
On the screen, Darin stood tall in a crisp suit, his face cold and distant. At his side, Lenore clung to his arm, radiant with a dazzling smile.
It was a perfect match.
Vincent immediately grabbed the remote and switched the TV off.
Silence hung heavy in the room.
After a few seconds, he took a deep breath and looked at her. ""Harriet, I know what happened.""
""You couldn't escape before. But now... Darin has lost his memory."" His voice was soft, but firm. ""Come with me. Let's leave, shall we?""
Harriet lowered her eyes. ""Thank you, Vincent. I've already started the paperwork to go abroad.""
""The Foley family has been in politics for generations. He can't leave the country,"" she paused. ""But if I go, he'll never see me again.""
Joy flickered in Vincent's gaze. Without any thinking, he reached for her hand. ""That's wonderful! I'll go with you to get it done.""
Harriet's body stiffened. She soon pulled her hand away.
Only then did he realize he was overreacting. ""I'm sorry. I was just... too excited,"" he explained.
""But I hope you understand how I feel about you."" He looked at her with earnest gentleness.
""You've noticed it all this time, haven't you?""
Harriet remained silent.
Of course she knew.
From the very first day Darin had forced her, Vincent had been helping her from the shadows.
He'd once offered to help her escape, but she knew better than anyone the kind of man Darin was.
She had tried to run at least ten times. Not once had she succeeded. The longest lasted ten minutes before she was dragged back.
Once, a man had only chatted her up at a bar, and by the next day, he had vanished from the city without a trace.
Darin could reach everywhere. She could never escape, and she couldn't drag Vincent down with her.
That was why she never responded to him.
She closed her eyes, fingertips trembling. ""Vincent, I...""
Vincent seemed to know what she wanted to say and quickly interrupted, ""I'm not asking you to say anything now!""
""I just want you to know..."" With a deep breath, his tone was soft but resolute. ""Once you leave here, you'll finally be free to live your own life.""
""To do the work you love, go to the places you like, and... fall in love with someone who makes your heart race.""
His smile was bittersweet. ""Even if that person isn't me, I'll still be happy for you.""
""I just want you to have a normal life again, not be chained down by this past year.""
Harriet blinked. She could feel her eyes were burning.
After a long moment, she whispered, ""Thank you.""
""When I leave here, I'll start over. Travel, work, and... fall in love again."" She gazed out the window at the bright sunshine. Her voice was light.
Vincent finally exhaled in relief and no longer frowned. ""I'll go with you to finish the paperwork.""
That afternoon, Vincent accompanied her to file for expedited travel documents.
""The visa can be ready in as fast as two weeks,"" the clerk said, handing back her ID. ""Safe travels.""
As Harriet stepped out of the embassy, sunlight spilled across her face. For the first time in so long, she felt a rush of relief.
On the way to drop Harriet off at home, Vincent chatted about her future plans abroad.
He said once her paperwork was ready, she could go first. His family also had businesses overseas, and he would apply for a transfer there.
""Don't feel pressured, Harriet."" Afraid she might refuse, he quickly added, ""We were planning overseas expansion anyway. I'm not doing this just for you.""
The car stopped at the villa. Harriet was about to get out when Vincent suddenly called, ""Wait.""
He reached out and gently smoothed the strands of hair the wind had blown across her face, treating her like something fragile and precious.
Harriet instinctively lifted her gaze—then froze.
On the steps nearby, someone was staring at her coldly.
Chapter 3
Darin stood there in his tailored suit. Without a word, his steely gaze filled the air with dominance and oppression.
Her fingers started to tremble. She quickly turned to Vincent. ""You should go.""
But Vincent hadn't noticed anything strange. He was still talking, ""When your papers come through, you...""
""Just go!"" Her voice tightened, almost pleading as her eyes begged him.
He hesitated, then finally nodded. ""Alright. Be careful.""
After his car disappeared down the drive, she finally gathered all the courage to turn around and walk toward the stairs, step by step.
Darin was standing still and staring at her. His expression was unreadable.
Harriet's body started to shake. She could almost hear her heart pounding.
""Will he be angry?
""Or will he break another man's arm just for a slight touch?"" Her mind couldn't stop.
Instead, she heard his cold voice.
""We have guests. Go make coffee.""
Without another glance, he turned and walked away. His footsteps gradually faded into the distance.
Harriet stood frozen for a long time before she dared look up.
He seemed to feel nothing.
""Looks like he really lost his memory,"" Harriet thought to herself.
She let out a quiet breath of relief and went to the kitchen to make coffee.
When she carried the drinks into the living room, she realized someone new was there.
Immediately, she recognized that it was Lenore Cobb, the same woman who had just been announced as Darin's fiancée on the news.
At that moment, Troy, Selena, and Aurora were all around Lenore, smiling warmly as they discussed wedding arrangements.
Darin sat on their side and simply kept listening.
Harriet lowered her head, placed the cup down, and spoke softly, ""Ms. Cobb, your coffee.""
Lenore looked up and saw Harriet. A faint, mocking smile appeared on her face.
She reached out to take the cup, and then suddenly ""slipped.""
Within a second, all the hot coffee splashed all over her.
Before Harriet could even react, Aurora's hand flew across her face with a sharp slap.
""You did it on purpose, didn't you?!""
Harriet opened her mouth, trying to explain.
""It wasn't me...""
Before she could finish, Aurora shrieked over her and cried out.
""Darin! I've been meaning to tell you this maid is trying to seduce you!""
Her voice dripped with disgust as she pointed at Harriet. ""She's been secretly collecting your things! She's definitely into you! And now that she knows you're engaged to Lenore, she's all jealous and even tried to burn her!""
Harriet stood cold. She couldn't believe how easily Aurora twisted the truth.
""I didn't..."" Her voice was shaking. But before she could say something for herself, Lenore spoke up.
Her eyes shimmered with tears as she looked at Darin. ""Darin, a person like you will always be surrounded by people who try to approach you. If you don't do anything this time, others might as well follow her example."" Her voice was soft.
Troy and Selena immediately agreed, ""Yes! You have to do something harsh!""
Harriet froze.
It was at this moment that she realized it was all an act.
A trap they had carefully staged.
And Darin hated nothing more than women who tried to seduce him.
Without any surprise, Darin's icy voice fell.
""Take her away and punish her right now.""
Then he bent down and held Lenore in his arms, carrying her upstairs. ""I'll have the private doctor come."" He didn't even look back.
Before Harriet could defend herself, two guards seized her arms and dragged her out roughly.
Outside the villa, night pressed down heavily.
Aurora gripped a barbed whip. Her face was all twisted with excitement and malice.
""Harriet, you finally fell into my hands.""
She raised the whip and lashed it down hard.
Crack!
The first strike split her skin.
""This one's for stealing my place!""
Crack!
Blood went everywhere.
""This one's for seducing my brother!""
Crack!
""This one's for never knowing your place!""
On and on it went.
""Why don't you scream now? My brother won't protect you anymore!""
Harriet bit down hard on her lip, refusing to make any sound.
But each lash of the barbed whip tore deeper into her flesh. She felt like she was going to be ripped apart alive.
Blood trickled down her back, arms, and legs, dripping onto the ground.
It was ninety-nine lashes.
Aurora poured years of resentment into every strike. She hit harder and harder until Harriet almost blacked out.
All she could hear was Aurora's scream and curses, along with the cracks of the whip against her body.
When the last lash fell, Harriet finally collapsed into the blood on the ground.
Chapter 4
When Harriet woke again, she was locked inside a storage room.
The wounds on her back had already begun to scab, which hurt her with every slight movement. She forced herself to stand up and knocked on the door.
A guard's cold voice came through, ""Ms. Aurora said you still haven't learned your lesson. You have to be locked up for three more days in here. No food or water.""
He paused, then added, ""Mr. Foley also agreed.""
Harriet slid down against the door. All of a sudden, she laughed.
She knew better than anyone how much Aurora hated her.
Years ago, she was mistakenly believed to be the daughter of the Foley family. During all this time, Aurora suffered a lot outside.
When Aurora finally returned home as the real daughter, Darin refused to let Harriet, the fake one, leave the family. He kept spoiling her, and no one, even Aurora, could kick her out.
But now, Darin had lost his memory. He couldn't remember her, nor his obsessive feelings towards her.
Now would be the best chance for Aurora to get back at her.
Leaning against the cold wall, Harriet didn't struggle or knock again.
Soon, she'd be leaving anyway.
There was no need to cause any trouble at this stage.
She had accepted it.
There were no windows in the storage room. Days and nights all blurred into one.
Curled in the corner, Harriet couldn't sleep from the pain, so she counted her breaths to pass the hours.
Each day, Aurora had a pile of photos thrown inside.
All those photos were the intimate moments between Darin and Lenore.
There were photos of him whispering into her ear with his arm around her at a gala.
There were photos of him smoothing down her dress in a gentle gesture.
There were also photos of him putting a diamond ring on Lenore's finger and kissing her in front of all the guests.
And on the back of each photo, Aurora had scrawled in red ink.
""This is the fiancée my brother deserves.""
""Who the hell do you think you are?""
""Stop dreaming. He'll never remember you.""
Three days later, the door finally opened.
Harriet could hardly open her eyes under the blinding lights. She squinted at the door and saw Aurora standing there, looking down at her.
""My brother threw Lenore the grandest birthday party,"" she sneered. ""What are you waiting for? Go play waitress.""
Harriet tried to pull herself up against the wall. She couldn't stand without trembling, but there was no room for her to negotiate.
She quickly put on some ointment and forced down a little food and water before she was sent straight to the banquet.
Just as Aurora had said, Darin spared no expense.
The ballroom glittered like a starry sky. Crystal chandeliers sparkled overhead. A tower of champagne rose higher than a man.
And the highlight was Darin's gift to Lenore.
It was a rare blue diamond necklace worth millions.
He placed it around her neck himself when the room erupted in applause.
Still, there were some whispers.
""Has Darin really lost his memory? He used to be crazy about Harriet...""
""Keep your voice down! The Foleys were bold enough to push this engagement while he's like this. If he ever remembers, won't he destroy the whole family...""
""They say it's permanent. The doctors confirmed...""
Harriet kept her head down, quietly working on the waitress stuff as though none of this concerned her.
And her calm was interrupted.
A pair of heels stopped in front of her.
She looked up, meeting Lenore's smiling gaze.
""Harriet."" Lenore swirled her champagne, lips curving. ""Did you like the little gift I gave you last time we met?""
Harriet met her eyes calmly. ""You don't need to do this.""
Softly, she added, ""Darin lost his memory. He has no feelings for me now. I won't come between you two.""
Lenore gave her a mocking smile.
""Easy for you to say. Do you know how long I've loved him? You can't imagine how happy I was when I finally got this engagement.""
She grabbed Harriet so hard that her nails dug into her arm. Her eyes cannot hide all the hatred anymore.
""And what happened? He ignored me and said you were the only one! I loved him so much that I begged him, offering my family's fortune as dowry, but he threw me out without a second thought.""
Her voice shook. ""That day, I went to find him again in the pouring rain. And I saw it! I saw it with my own eyes—him pressing you against the window with the biggest tenderness. I saw him swearing the whole world could burn as long as he had you.""
""Do you know how hopeless I felt that day? And now you think I can let this all go just because you said you won't come between us?!""
She stepped back and smoothed down her skirt. The smile on her face was sweet yet vicious.
""Harriet, remember, I'll make you suffer more than you could ever imagine.""
Then she turned and walked away.
Cold sweat broke across Harriet's back. A sense of impending doom gripped her.
Just as she set down her tray to leave, Lenore's cry split the air.
""My necklace! It's gone!""
The ballroom erupted.
""That's the blue diamond Mr. Foley just gave her!""
""Who would dare steal it?""
In the middle of the chaos, Lenore looked around pitifully and then pointed straight at Harriet. ""I was just talking to her...""
In an instant, every eye in the room fixed on Harriet.
And Darin's gaze was the coldest of them all, like a blade of ice.
Chapter 5
Before Harriet could react, Aurora had already rushed in with bodyguards.
""Search her!"" Aurora ordered.
Harriet struggled to step back, trying to explain, ""I didn't steal...""
But the bodyguards had already pinned her to the ground and forcibly stripped her clothes off.
""Found it!"" Aurora said loudly, raising the blue diamond necklace high.
Then, she gave Harriet a slap, causing blood to ooze out of Harriet's mouth.
""Haven't you learned your lesson from last time?"" Aurora snapped at Harriet in a sharp voice.
Harriet's vision went black, but she still tried to explain, ""I didn't steal it... They've got surveillance here. You can check it...""
However, before she could finish her words, another slap landed on her face.
Aurora turned to Darin and said, ""Darin, looks like she's still not willing to give up. Last time, she deliberately scalded Lenore, and this time, she even stole Lenore's necklace. We must teach her a good lesson and let her know her place!""
With that, she revealed an evil smile and continued, ""I happened to see a beggar outside the hotel just now. How about we let the two of them sleep together tonight?""
Aurora's cruel words sent a chill down Harriet's spine.
And the next second, Harriet heard Darin agree to that vicious idea, and his eyes were filled with disgust towards Harriet.
Harriet couldn't believe what she had just heard.
She immediately pounced over, trying to grab Darin's sleeve. ""I really didn't steal this necklace! And I don't have any thoughts towards you either! Darin, just check the surveillance! I...""
But Aurora's expression changed instantly, and she quickly cut Harriet off, instructing the bodyguards, ""Take her away!""
The bodyguards grabbed Harriet by her hair with no mercy.
But Harriet tightly held onto Darin's sleeve, not letting it go, her fingertips turning pale.
Darin coldly pried open her grip.
The cold touch spread from Harriet's fingertips to her heart.
When her last finger was pried off Darin's sleeve, she heard him say, ""It's disgusting.""
Harriet clenched her teeth, but tears fell down uncontrollably.
At that moment, past memories flooded back into her mind. She remembered those days when Darin cherished her like she was the apple of his eye. Even when she just got a little scratch, he would still feel so worried...
A year ago, when she had a fever, he flew back from abroad overnight and stayed by her bedside for three days, taking care of her with all his heart.
Six months ago, a wealthy young man approached her and flirted with her at a banquet, and just the next day, his family business declared bankruptcy.
Three months ago, because she wanted to eat the cake from the shop in the west of the city in the middle of the night, he personally drove there to buy it for her. But that night, he had a car accident.
Over the last year, they had sex countless times, as if he were so obsessed with her.
But now, he stood under the dazzling crystal chandelier in the banquet hall, allowing others to send her to sleep with a dirty beggar.
He even slowly wiped his fingers with a handkerchief, looking as if touching her was something disgusting.
Soon, the bodyguards locked Harriet in a dark guest room.
She curled up in the corner, the wound on her back hurting with burning pain.
Not long after, the door was opened, and a smelly, dirty beggar walked in.
His clothes were tattered, and the strands of his hair stuck together on his head. He grinned, showing a mouthful of yellow teeth, and his eyes gleamed nauseatingly.
""Hey, baby..."" He rubbed his hands lewdly and walked towards Harriet.
Harriet screamed and dodged him, grabbing the desk lamp and smashing it over. The beggar cursed in pain and slapped her in the face.
""Bitch! Be good, or you'll get hurt. Ms. Foley told me, I can have you however I want tonight...""
With that, he pressed Harriet on the bed and tore off her clothes with her dirty hands.
Harriet cried and struggled so desperately, scratching the beggar's face and leaving bloody marks on it. But soon, her hands were tied up with his belt.
Luckily, before he could get what he wanted, Harriet reached the vase on the bedside table.
The next second, she smashed it on his head with a thud.
The vase broke, and the beggar groaned and fell.
Harriet quickly broke free and stumbled out of the room.
There was no one in the hallway. She ran as fast as she could barefoot, afraid that the beggar would catch up.
In a panic, she pushed open a half-closed door and went inside to hide.
The room was pitch black. She held her breath and cautiously curled up in a corner.
She thought she was safe now.
However, just as she was about to heave a sigh of relief, the bathroom door was suddenly opened.
""Who's there?"" Darin's deep, drunken voice sounded.
Instantly, Harriet's face turned pale with extreme nervousness.",1,1758324415.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False

She lets out a sniff which gives away our hiding spot. The kid, as frightened as my daughter calls 911 on video call. The man lunges at him and delivers a kick that echoes through the cafe. The kid not knowingwhat to do, picks up a hot coffee, and chucks it towards the man. It burns him. That gives me enough time to pick up a chair and throw it at him. The kid joins me and we end up tackling him. Just then he pulls out a gun and points it at my daughter. I have had enough of this shit and i pull the gun outta his hand. He manages to get ahold of my daughter and throws her across the floor. I run toward her, and see if shes okay. Theres a deep cut in her forehead. I felt like i failed her as a father. With anger seething inside me, i rush at the man and deliver an uppercut so clean it felt like i was in a boxing ring. It didnt matter to me that i was shot by this man. He messed with my daughter, i was gonna do everything to protect her. He manages to get ahold of his handgun. He fires a round to the kids phone and the line goes dead silent, then points his gun at my head. At that exact moment we hear sirens. He sprints to the door, clearly thinking he was gonna Usain Bolt From the police. Just then the kid blocks the door as i tackle him and keep him down 'not so strong without your handgun' I say as police Ram through the door. They get him in handcuffs and take him to a squad car. They take off. A few days later i was called into court. The man claimed I had attacked him but the kid had his manager present footage from the security cameras. The man, who shot me, injured my daughter, and broke my car, turned out to have had similiar cases in the past, where 12 people in total have gone to the hospital. He was fined for EVERY SINGLE PERSON he injured. Along with that had 10 charges for property damage, 5 for Vandalism, 7 for Assault, and 15 years in prison. Whilst leaving the court I Said Victoriously ""This is why you dont mess with me, OR my daughter.""

We are now in that gap between anger and forgetting. I call it outrage fatigue. Ito yung panahon na humuhupa ang galit, people get tired of staying angry, at unti-unting lumilipat ang atensyon sa ibang issue. At dito umaasa ang mga politiko—na magsasawa tayo, tatahimik, at kakalimutan ang iskandalo.

Keep guarding. Keep asking questions. Stay angry.

Kapag may scandal, mabilis ang galawan ng mga politiko. Lahat puro optics—kunwari may ginagawa, pero totoo, damage control lang. Tingnan niyo na lang yung DPWH corruption issue.

Ganito lagi ang eksena:

1. Task forces at fact-finding committees na malakas ang pasiklaban, pero after months… wala.


2. Suspension ng mga maliliit na tao—engineers, regional directors—pero yung malalaking isda, untouchable.


3. Reshuffling ng opisyal—lipat lang ng mesa, same racket pa rin.


4. Big statements about “zero tolerance”, pero parehong contractors pa rin ang nananalo sa bids.


5. Site inspections with cameras rolling—naka-hardhat, naka-smile, pero overpriced at substandard pa rin ang kalsada.



This is not reform. This is theater. Ginagawa lang para patahimikin tayo, hindi para linisin ang sistema.

Kaya wag magpaloko. Demand accountability. Heads must roll. Change must take effect—hindi bukas. Ngayon.

Never be satisfied sa press cons, soundbites, o staged photos. What we need: real reform, real prosecutions, real action.

By Ned Lannamann
September 09, 2025 5:10PM PDT

Everyone knows about the coffee, the beer, and the strip clubs, but Portland’s reputation as a vinyl haven is still something of a local secret. This city continues to be paradise for record collectors, evidenced by three new shops that have opened for business in recent months—plus a decades-old stalwart that’s successfully relocated after losing its longtime home.
Echoes in Space Records

You’ll know from the pink-tinted windows that Echoes in Space was designed to be a portal to another realm. The realm in question is one of electronic dance music, and the proprietors—Cee White, Nick Mejia, and Seth Mooney—are seasoned DJs aiming to make a space for working DJs. Opened in August, the store has racks of vinyl brimming with 12-inches of dance tracks not easily available in the U.S., along with a smattering of used records of all genres. “A big part of the ethos is that we would order these great records from Europe, but we were paying $30 shipping for one single record,” Mejia says. “So we were like, well, let’s just order 10 copies for all our friends. And then it ballooned from there.”

Open late, Echoes in Space is meant to offer more than the typical record store experience; White, Mejia, and Mooney want it to be the spot where, for example, DJs can pick up replacement needles before hitting a club gig. And with livestreamed sets on tap, the store is poised to become a centrifuge for the dance music community. Echoes in Space, 6315 SE Holgate Blvd., instagram.com/echoesinspacerecords. 2–10 pm Thursday–Monday.
Second Chance Records

Owner Tasha Brain makes sure every item in stock puts its best foot forward. Before hitting the bins, each disc is given a serious clean—first with the manual washing system Spin-Clean and then with a HumminGuru ultrasonic cleaner. It’s then given a listen and put in a fresh inner sleeve, with any notes about the condition or sound marked on the price sticker.

Due to all that prep, Second Chance’s inventory isn’t huge, but Brain says since the store opened in July, neighborhood customers have appreciated that they can come in for 20 minutes, flip through the bins (organized in categories like Indie, Prog and Yacht), check out the rack of affordable T-shirts, or simply hang in the corner and view the current artist’s work on display.

While all the records have been given a new lease on life, that’s not the only meaning behind Second Chance’s name—evident from the store’s logo of an open cell door. “I’m a huge advocate of second chances for people,” Brain says. “I’ve really started to look more at this problem with people who don’t get a second chance when they reenter society after prison. The barriers they come across are just unbelievable.” Second Chance Records, 5744 E Burnside St., instagram.com/second_chance_recordspdx. Noon–8 pm Wednesday–Sunday.
Paul’s Boutique

This cozy space in the basement of Alberta Studios can make Paul’s Boutique feel like a speakeasy—but co-owner Greg Glover wants it to be anything but exclusive. The store, which opened in February, is a labor of love for Glover, whose obsession for music spills over from his day job as a DJ for KNRK and KGON radio and into every corner of the shop, from the vintage standup of Debbie Harry to the mural of Steely Dan’s Can’t Buy a Thrill on the store’s front door.

The door’s backside features Hawkwind’s Warrior on the Edge of Time—a concession to Glover’s business partner (and store namesake) Paul Anson, who also runs Landfill Rescue Unit Records on Southeast Belmont Street. Glover says he and Anson have wildly opposing tastes in music, but it all finds a place here, with scores aplenty in the dollar bins and new releases priced competitively. “I don’t feel the need to mark things up,” Glover says. “I’d rather sell it for two bucks cheaper and have it move.”

In fact, what Glover’s found most gratifying are the younger record buyers who come down the stairs for their next discovery. “Some of the kids that are just getting started with their turntable, they can come and find something that’s inexpensive and in a friendly environment with zero attitude.” And yes, Glover confirms: The shop always has a copy of the Beastie Boys’ Paul’s Boutique in stock. Paul’s Boutique, 1627 NE Alberta St., instagram.com/paulsboutiquepdx. Noon–5 pm Thursday–Sunday.
2nd Avenue Records

As far as local institutions go, they don’t get any cooler than 2nd Avenue Records, the downtown record store that’s been slinging rare punk 7-inches, band T-shirts, and new and used music of all kinds since 1982. At the end of last year, 2nd Avenue was told it would need to move out of its longtime home in the Governor Building, but following a few stressful months of searching, 2nd Avenue found a new storefront just a few blocks up the street. The new shop opened its doors in April—on Record Store Day, no less—although moving the massive inventory was “backbreaking, literally,” says manager Cathy Hagen.

While it’s missing the decadeslong patina that made the original store so distinctive, the new space has higher ceilings and easier access to all the album racks, even though Hagen says it’s not much bigger than the old one. And while 2nd Avenue’s famous sign isn’t allowed outside the new building, the store’s name is as apropos as ever. Just be aware that Google Maps didn’t get the memo—it incorrectly directs customers around the corner to Southwest Ash Street. 2nd Avenue Records, 121 SW 2nd Ave., 2ndavenuerecords.com. Noon–5 pm daily.

Willamette Week’s reporting has concrete impacts that change laws, force action from civic leaders, and drive compromised politicians (Conservative Republicans) from public office.

**Disclaimer:** This contains depictions of emotional manipulation, child grooming, and psychological control. Nothing in this work is meant to support, glorify, or romanticize abuse or inappropriate behavior. 

CH1:

Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.



Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a particularly large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in pretty useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and, in their opinion, there was no finer boy anywhere.



They also had a nephew, but they were far less keen to mention him. His name was Harry Potter.



At this moment, Harry was the reason for the Dursleys’ unusually tense silence over the breakfast table. A large, heavy post had just thudded onto the kitchen floor, and from it, Mr Dursley had extracted not the usual bill or brochure, but a glossy magazine called “Young Style Monthly”.



On the cover, looking small, pale, and miserable under a thick layer of powder, was eight-year-old Harry. His hair was slicked down unnaturally flat. He was wearing a ridiculously frilly shirt and holding a model sailboat, staring out at the world with a look of profound boredom.



“Again,” snarled Mr Dursley, flinging the magazine down so it slid across the polished table. “Page six as well. A ‘spread’, they call it. Disgusting.”



Mrs Dursley sniffed, though her eyes gleamed with a peculiar sort of pride. “It’s not disgusting, Vernon, it’s… commerce. The cheque was for one hundred and twenty pounds. One hundred and twenty! For one afternoon’s work.”



She said this as if Harry had spent the afternoon lazing about, rather than being poked, prodded, and told to ‘smile with his eyes’ for six hours by a woman with a clipboard.



“It’s not the money, Petunia,” said Vernon, his face becoming an ugly shade of purple above his tight collar. “It’s the… the attention.”



The Dursleys had, for nearly five years, tried to squash the oddness out of Harry. They had failed. His hair grew back overnight, no matter how short Petunia cut it. He had a knack for ending up on the school roof when being chased by Dudley’s gang. And, most infuriating of all, he had a face that, when clean and not hidden behind broken glasses, was strangely… compelling.



It had started a year ago. A scout for a clothing catalogue had seen Harry looking longingly into a toy shop window while the Dursleys fussed over Dudley a few doors down. The scout had only seen a photogenic boy with striking green eyes. Petunia, after a furious whispered conversation with Vernon about the cost of keeping him, had seen an opportunity. Harry’s ‘career’ had begun.



It was the perfect Dursley solution. It forced Harry to be clean and presentable. It made them a tidy profit, which they insisted was merely to cover the cost of his upkeep. And, most importantly, it was a deeply normal thing for “attractive” children to do. It proved he wasn’t a freak, and it proved he was useful. It was (in their minds) a compensation.



“The Pierces will have seen it,” Vernon groaned. “He’ll be the talk of the Grunnings golf day.”



“Nonsense, Vernon,” said Petunia, though she looked worried. “They’ll think it’s… modern. Ambitious.”



At that moment, the boy in question tried to sneak into the kitchen to fetch the bacon. He was small and skinny for his age, with jet-black hair that had already sprung back into its usual messy state. His old, overlarge glasses were mended with Sellotape, a fact that was carefully hidden during any modelling session.



“You!” barked Uncle Vernon, spotting him. “This is your fault! Prancing about in little sailor suits!”



Harry didn’t think standing perfectly still for hours counted as prancing, but he knew better than to say so. “Sorry, Uncle Vernon,” he mumbled, a well-practised response.



“The cheque will clear today,” Aunt Petunia said, shooting a warning look at her husband. “We’ll need to get you a new blazer for the next shoot. That one’s looking shabby. Can’t have you looking shabby. It reflects poorly.”



This was how it always went. A fraction of the money Harry earned was spent on him, but only on things necessary to maintain the image required to earn more money. It was a miserable cycle.



“Dudley, darling, would you like more sausage?” Aunt Petunia asked sweetly, turning to her son.



Dudley, who had been glaring at the magazine cover with jealousy, began to bawl. “Why does he get to be in magazines! I want to be in magazines!”



“No, no, Duddykins, you don’t,” said Aunt Petunia, flapping her hands. “It’s dreadfully tiresome work. Isn’t it, Harry?”



“Yes, Aunt Petunia,” said Harry tonelessly. “Very tiresome.”



“See? Now, eat your breakfast, a growing boy like you needs strength.”



As Uncle Vernon left for work, he pointed a fat finger at Harry. “No funny business today. I want you looking normal. Normal!” He seemed to think that modelling might encourage Harry’s other, more peculiar talents.



The day passed in its usual dullness. Dudley smashed up his new racing bike, cried about having too few presents, and then went off to bully other children at the park. Harry was ordered to weed the flowerbeds, a chore he preferred to the bright lights and false smiles of the studio.



That evening, as the family sat watching “Wogan”, the news came on.



“And finally, meteorological offices across Britain are reporting a most unusual bout of static interference on all forecasting equipment,” said the newsreader. “The phenomenon has baffled scientists, and seems to be centred right over the Home Counties…”



Uncle Vernon jerked upright in his chair. “Static!” he spat, as if it were a filthy word. His small eyes swivelled to Harry, who was trying to become invisible in the shadows by the door. “You. This is your doing. It’s that… that modelling. Put ideas into their heads! Made them notice you!”



Harry was utterly bewildered. What did weather static have to do with him wearing a woollen jumper for a back-to-school spread? He was just a boy. A boy who, for the moment, had earned the Dursleys one hundred and twenty pounds, and whose only reward was the deep, simmering fear in his uncle’s eyes and the cold, calculating pride in his aunt’s. He had no idea that in three years, his life would become much worse.



For now, there were only the outfits, the cupboard, and the next photoshoot.



xxx



The days bled into one another, a grey smear of chores, Dudley’s tantrums, and the dark, spider-filled cupboard under the stairs. But every so often, a letter would arrive on thick, expensive paper, addressed to “The Guardians of Harry Potter, Re: Modelling Assignment.”



These letters were Harry’s lifeline.



Aunt Petunia would read them aloud at breakfast, her voice a mix of disdain and avarice. “They want him next Tuesday. A spring catalogue for ‘Bumblebee Boutique’. ‘Fresh, country-lane aesthetic’. They’ve provided a diet sheet. No refined sugars, plenty of greens. They want his complexion clear.”



For anyone else, it would have sounded like a prison sentence. For Harry, it was a reprieve, an escape.



The day before the shoot, the rules changed. He was given an extra helping of vegetables while Dudley sulked over his denied second helping of pudding. He was sent to bed early—“They want you well-rested, no dark circles!”—which meant an extra precious hour away from his uncle’s grumbling and his cousin’s snuffling. He was even excused from weeding the garden lest he get dirt under his nails.



The shoot day itself was a bizarre alternate reality. He would be collected by a harried woman named Jeanette in a small, cluttered car that smelled of perfume and cigarettes—a far cry from Uncle Vernon’s immaculate company car. For the drive, he was no longer Harry Potter, the freak in the cupboard. He was “the talent.”



The studio was a whirlwind of noise and light. Strangers fussed over him, their touches clinical but not unkind. They clicked their tongues over the state of his glasses, always swiftly swapping them for plain-lensed, fashionable alternatives. They tutted at his haircut, slicking it down with so much product it felt like a helmet, or artfully mussing it with a sticky wax that smelled of oranges.



“Chin up, love. Think of something lovely. A puppy! Think of a puppy!” “Give us a little smile, Harry. Not with your teeth, just with your eyes. That’s it! Perfect.”



It was exhausting. The lights were boiling, the positions were awkward, and the clothes were often itchy. But it was a different kind of exhaustion than hauling bags of cement for Uncle Vernon or scrubbing the kitchen floor on his hands and knees. This exhaustion came with a strange, silent praise. When he did what they asked, people smiled. They said, “Excellent!” and “Wonderful!” They didn’t shout. They never called him a freak.



He learned the language of it. The “little smile with the eyes” was really just letting his mind go blank, retreating to a quiet place inside himself where the Dursleys couldn’t reach. The “thoughtful, faraway look” was simply him thinking about what it would be like to live in one of the clean houses he was posed in front of, to have parents who were waiting for him somewhere.



He discovered that he was good at it. Jeanette started calling him her “little professional.” The photographers liked his “pliability.” He could hold a difficult pose for minutes without complaint. He never fidgeted. He had spent a lifetime being still and small, trying not to be noticed. Here, those very skills were currency.



Once, after a long day modelling a new line of school uniforms, the photographer, a man with a kind smile and a silver earring, ruffled his hair—his real, messy hair, after the wax had been washed out.



“You did great today, kid. Real trooper. You actually like this?” Harry, surprised by the direct question, had just shrugged. The man laughed. “Quiet one, eh? Well, it beats digging ditches, I suppose.”



Harry had almost smiled then. It did beat digging ditches. It beat everything at Privet Drive.



He began to hoard the tiny moments of kindness like treasure. The makeup artist who sneaked him a barley sugar when Aunt Petunia wasn’t looking. The seamstress who let him keep a single, interesting-looking button that had fallen off a coat. These were proof that the world outside his cupboard was not entirely composed of people like the Dursleys.



Back at number four, the dynamic shifted in a way that was both bitter and satisfying. The money he earned bought him a fragile, contemptuous truce. He was no longer just a drain on resources; he was a producing asset. The harsh labour didn’t stop, but the worst of it was sometimes postponed if he had a shoot coming up. A bruised knee or a sunburn was bad for business.



He would lie in his cupboard at night, listening to the house creak, and instead of counting spiders, he would run through the day’s poses in his head. He would practice the “little smile with the eyes” in the dark. It was his secret weapon. His passport out of the weeding and the scrubbing, if only for a day. He would rather stand for hours in a stiff, frilly outfit under hot lights than spend five minutes longer than necessary under Uncle Vernon’s glower.



It was a pitiful sort of freedom, bought with forced smiles and a growling stomach. But for Harry Potter, it was the only freedom he had.



xxx



The cheques from Young Style Monthly became a regular, if begrudgingly accepted, feature of life at Number Four. But the envelope that arrived on Tuesday morning was different. It was heavier, the paper thicker and more expensive. The logo, “Aethelred & Associates,” was embossed in gold leaf.



Aunt Petunia slit it open with a butter knife, her eyes scanning the contents. Her breath hitched, a tiny, sharp sound. Her long fingers trembled slightly.



“Vernon,” she said, her voice unnaturally high. “Vernon, listen to this.”



Uncle Vernon grunted from behind his paper.



“It’s a new agency. A very exclusive one. They’ve seen the… the Bumblebee Boutique spreads. They want Harry for a… a thematic series.” She swallowed. “They’re offering two thousand pounds. For two days’ work.”



The newspaper lowered slowly. Vernon Dursley’s face appeared, his small eyes wide, his moustache seeming to bristle with the force of his astonishment. “Two thousand?”



“Two thousand,” Petunia repeated, her voice a reverent whisper. She looked at Harry, who was scrubbing the frying pan at the sink, with a new, intense calculation. “They’re sending a car. A private car. They’re very specific about the… the aesthetic. They’re sending a mood board.”



She pulled out a large sheet of card. Pinned to it were photographs of a boy, younger than Harry, with porcelain skin and large, wistful eyes. The boy was dressed in an explosion of lace, ribbons, and velvet. He wore knee-length trousers with elaborate suspenders, a frilly blouse with a Peter Pan collar, and a jacket that was too small and too ornate. In one picture, he was holding a giant lollipop; in another, he was staring sadly out of a rain-streaked window, a single, perfect tear on his cheek. The overall effect was one of cloying, hyper-realised innocence.



Vernon’s brow furrowed. “What’s he supposed to be? A… a fairy?”



“It’s artistic, Vernon,” Petunia said swiftly, though her own lips were pursed in distaste. She tapped the figure on the cheque. “It’s two thousand pounds. We could… we could finally get the conservatory quotes.”



That settled it. Money, as always, trumped taste. “Well,” Vernon boomed, recovering his bluster. “As long as it pays. Just… just keep him out of sight until it’s over. Don’t want anyone from the firm seeing it.”



The news was broken to Dudley over his second helping of trifle.



“Potter’s got a new job,” Vernon said, attempting joviality. “Earning his keep!”



Dudley snatched the mood board. His piggy eyes scanned the pictures of the lace-clad boy. A slow, malicious grin spread across his face.



“Sissy!” he roared, pointing a fat, jelly-covered finger at Harry. “He’s gonna be a little sissy! A frilly little girl!” He began to chant, his voice a gleeful wheeze. “Potter’s a poof! Potter’s a poof in a dress!”



Harry kept his head down, his cheeks burning. He hated Dudley’s taunts more than the chores, more than the cupboard. They stuck to him like tar.



xxx



The day of the shoot arrived. The car that collected him was long, black, and silent. The studio was not the usual bright, chaotic space. It was hushed, draped in dark velvet. The director, a thin, pale man in an expensive suit named Mr Aethelred, spoke in a soft, precise voice that didn’t seem to invite questions. His eyes, magnified by thin glasses, lingered on Harry in a way that made the fine hairs on his arms stand up.



The outfit they put him in was more intricate than anything he’d ever worn. A white blouse with leg-of-mutton sleeves and enough lace to curtain a window. Velvet short trousers that ended just above his knobbly knees. White knee-socks with little blue clocks on them. And a pair of patent leather shoes with a silver buckle.



As he was dressed by a silent, efficient woman, a strange thing happened. The initial embarrassment, the echo of Dudley’s “sissy” jibes, began to fade. The fabrics were soft, expensive. The lace tickled his skin in a way that wasn’t entirely unpleasant. It was so far removed from his usual hand-me-down rags, from the scratchy wool of his school jumper, that it felt like wearing a costume from another world. A world where things were delicate and cared for.



Mr Aethelred positioned young Harry not in a sunny garden or a bright living room, but in a dimly lit set made to look like a child’s bedroom. It was too perfect, too still. A music box played a tinkling, slightly off-key melody.



“Now, Harry,” Mr Aethelred murmured, his camera clicking softly. “I want you to look… thoughtful. As if you’re waiting for someone. A special friend.”



Harry did as he was told. He retreated inside himself, to the quiet place. He thought of waiting for parents who never came. The look on his face must have been perfect, because Mr. Aethelred let out a soft sigh of satisfaction.



“Yes… yes, that’s it. Perfect innocence. Now, hold this.” He handed Harry a large, red lollipop. “Don’t lick it. Just hold it. Look at it as if it’s the most wonderful secret thing you’ve ever seen.”



Harry held the stupid lollipop. He looked at it. And a part of him, a part he didn’t understand, liked it. He liked the weight of the fine clothes. He liked the attention to detail—the way they’d combed his hair just so, the way the socks were perfectly straight. It was the opposite of the careless, brutal neglect of Privet Drive. Here, every part of him was considered, was seen, even if it was for a reason that felt vaguely unsettling.



He didn’t have the words for what was wrong with the pictures. He didn’t know about a book called “Lolita”. He only knew that the director’s quiet compliments felt different from Jeanette’s brusque praise. They felt like a secret. A wrong, but thrilling secret.



When he was returned to Privet Drive that evening, the two-thousand-pound cheque was already locked away in Vernon’s safe. Dudley was waiting.



“Where’s your frilly dress, poof?” he sneered, blocking the hallway.



Harry didn’t answer. He pushed past, heading for his cupboard. But as he closed the door and sat in the dark, he didn’t think about Dudley. He thought about the softness of the velvet. The strange, quiet power of having everyone in the room watching him, hanging on his every expression. He had looked in the monitor at one of the shots. The boy in the picture, with his large, sad eyes and perfect clothes, didn’t look like a freak. He looked… special.



It was a dangerous, vain thought. He tucked it away, a secret alongside his growing talent for pretending.



xxx



The two-thousand-pound cheque from Aethelred & Associates did not simply buy the Dursleys a new conservatory. It bought them a new car, a state-of-the-art television with a remote control, and a smug, unshakeable certainty that they had finally found the correct use for their nephew.



A week after the first shoot, another letter arrived. This one contained a contract, a document so thick and laden with legal jargon it made Uncle Vernon’s head swim. But the numbers were clear enough. A retainer of five hundred pounds a month, plus a minimum of two thousand pounds per commissioned shoot, with bonuses for “exclusive availability.” It was more than Vernon’s monthly salary at Grunnings.



The clause that made Petunia’s thin lips disappear into a tight white line was Section 7b: “Guardians or parental units shall not be permitted on set during creative sessions, so as not to disrupt the artistic process or the subject’s natural emotive state.”



“They don’t want us there,” she said, a flicker of unease in her pinched face.



“Good!” Vernon boomed, slapping the contract on the kitchen table. “Saves us the bother of having to sit around watching the boy gurn. As long as the money clears, they can have him in a ballerina’s tutu for all I care!”



And so it was settled. Harry Potter, aged nine, was signed into a long-term, exclusive contract with Aethelred & Associates.



The world of the studio became Harry’s secret life. Without Aunt Petunia’s hawk-like presence in the corner, the dynamic shifted entirely. Mr. Aethelred, the director, was no longer a distant, unsettling figure. He became a constant.



He was always there, his voice a soft, guiding murmur behind the camera. “A little more to the left, my dear… perfect. You have such a natural grace, Harry.” The compliments, once general, became personal. Intimate.



He began using nicknames.



“That’s my little dove,” he’d coo when Harry held a difficult pose. “My own perfect cherub.” He started bringing small gifts. Not things a boy might like, but things that fit the aesthetic. A singular exquisite chocolate in a gold wrapper. A vintage porcelain cup for his water instead of a plastic bottle. A silk handkerchief for him to dab his face with.



Harry, who had lived his entire life on a diet of neglect and insults, was utterly defenceless against this onslaught of attention. He was parched, and Mr Aethelred was offering a sweet, poisonous drink. He didn’t know that the way the man’s eyes lingered on him was wrong. He only knew that for the first time, someone looked at him and didn’t see a burden or a freak. The man saw something precious.



“You’re so unlike other boys, Harry,” Mr Aethelred said one day, adjusting a ribbon on Harry’s sleeve. His fingers, cold and thin, brushed against Harry’s wrist. Harry didn’t flinch. “They’re so loud. So crude. You have a rare and delicate spirit. I can see it.”



Harry drank in every word. It was so much better than being a waste of space.



The shoots became more elaborate, the themes more insistent. Harry was often posed in settings of childhood, but a childhood that was strangely sterile and melancholic. He was a lonely prince in a forgotten castle. A wistful ghost-boy in a sun-dappled nursery. Mr Aethelred’s obsession with capturing a very specific, vulnerable kind of beauty was all-consuming.



Harry, in turn, became obsessed with pleasing him. He practiced expressions in the cracked mirror in the Dursleys’ downstairs toilet when no one was looking. He learned how to make his eyes look larger, more luminous. He took meticulous care of the studio clothes, folding them with a reverence he never afforded his own ragged things. His value, his entire worth, had become inextricably linked to this world of make-believe and the approval of one strange, quiet man.



Back at Privet Drive, the money flowed, and the Dursleys’ greed comfortably smothered any niggling doubts. If Harry seemed quieter, more withdrawn, they put it down to him being tiresome. If he sometimes stared into space with a strangely practised, wistful expression, they simply told him to stop dawdling and take the rubbish out.



He was earning. He was useful. That was all that mattered.

The cheques from Aethelred & Associates continued to arrive with satisfying regularity, funding a lifestyle at Number Four that grew increasingly lavish. There was a new microwave, a video recorder, and talk of a holiday in Majorca. Harry’s value was measured in pounds and pence, and by that metric, he was the most valuable member of the household.



He had just turned nine and a half when the next letter came. It was not a summons for a shoot, but a request for a meeting. Mr Aethelred himself was coming to Privet Drive.



This caused a minor panic. Vernon spent an hour polishing the car that Harry’s earnings had bought, while Petunia feverishly dusted ornaments that were already gleaming. They were not hosting an artist; they were hosting a business associate of significant financial importance.



Mr Aethelred arrived precisely on time, a slim briefcase in his hand. He declined tea, his magnified eyes taking in the aggressively normal décor with barely concealed distaste. He got straight to the point.



“Mr and Mrs Dursley,” he began, his voice as soft and precise as ever. “We are all very pleased with Harry’s progress. He has a truly unique quality. A… luminosity.”



Vernon puffed out his chest. “The boy earns his keep,” he said gruffly.



“Indeed. And it is to protect that… luminosity… that I am here.” Mr Aethelred opened his briefcase and withdrew a single sheet of paper. “There is a small matter that requires your consent. A medical procedure.”



Petunia’s hand flew to her throat. “Medical? Is he ill?” Her concern was not for Harry, but for the potential interruption to the cash flow.



“Oh, goodness, no. Nothing like that,” Mr Aethelred said with a thin smile. “It is a matter of aesthetics. And practicality. Those glasses.” He said the word as if it were something distasteful found on the sole of his shoe. “They obscure his finest feature—those remarkable eyes. They are a barrier between the camera and his soul.”



He slid the paper across the coffee table. It was a consent form for a surgical procedure. The language was complex, full of medical and legal terms, but the destination was clear: a private clinic in Switzerland.



“It’s a revolutionary laser technique,” Mr Aethelred explained smoothly. “Not yet approved here, of course. The red tape is so tedious. But in Zurich, the best surgeons in the world perform it every day. They will make his sight perfect. He will never need glasses again.”



Vernon’s small eyes narrowed. “Surgery? On his eyes? Is it safe?”



“As safe as a trip to the dentist,” Mr Aethelred lied effortlessly. “The clinic caters to a very… discerning international clientele. It will be a brief trip. All expenses paid, naturally. And,” he added, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, “consider it an investment. The difference in his marketability will be astronomical. We’re talking about covers for \*Vogue Bambini\*. Campaigns for major European houses.”



The figures he then mentioned, hypothetical though they were, made Vernon’s moustache quiver. Petunia’s eyes gleamed. The word “Zurich” sounded expensive and exclusive. It appealed to their deepest aspirations of appearing sophisticated and successful.



The matter was settled before Harry was even called into the room.



When he was, Mr Aethelred took his hand, his touch cold and dry. “Harry, my dear,” he said, his magnified eyes soft. “How would you like to never wear these horrid old glasses again?”



Harry, who had been shouted at for breaking a cup just that morning because he hadn’t seen it clearly, was stunned. The idea was a fantasy.



“The doctors will fix your eyes,” Mr Aethelred continued. “You’ll be able to see everything perfectly. You’ll be even more perfect. My own little Adonis.” The classical reference was lost on Harry, but the tone of reverence was not.



He was hesitant. The word “operation” was frightening. But Mr. Aethelred’s voice was so reassuring, so full of promise. And the Dursleys, for once, were not scowling at him; they were looking at him with something akin to avaricious approval.



“It’s all settled, boy,” Uncle Vernon said, a strange heartiness in his voice. “You’ll do as you’re told. No arguments.”



“It’s a great opportunity,” Aunt Petunia added, her voice sharp. “Don’t you dare mess it up.”



A week later, Harry found himself on a quiet, private flight with Mr Aethelred. The clinic in Zurich was all white walls and hushed voices. The nurses spoke in gentle, accented English. Before the procedure, as a mild sedative began to cloud his thoughts, Mr Aethelred leaned over him.



“Just think, my dove,” he whispered, stroking his hair back from his forehead. “When you wake up, the world will be clear. And you will be so, so beautiful.”

The operation was quick. The recovery in a pristine room overlooking the Alps was lonely but painless. When the bandages came off, Harry opened his eyes. For the first time in his memory, the world rushed at him in sharp, brilliant, terrifying focus. He could see every pore on the nurse’s face, every leaf on the distant trees. He could see the look in Mr Aethelred’s eyes—a look of pure, unadulterated triumph.



“There he is,” Mr Aethelred breathed, cupping his face. “There’s my Adonis.”



Harry looked at his own reflection in the window. Without the broken glasses, his face seemed oddly naked. His scar was more visible. But his eyes, his green eyes, were now utterly unobscured. They were huge and bright and green. He looked… different. Prettier. The word felt strange in his mind.



That night, Mr Aethelred doted on young Harry with a box of gourmet chocolates. The too-sweet, creamy, indulgent bites melted in his mouth in the most heavenly way.



xxx



The return to England was marked not by fanfare, but by a new, intense focus. The first test shoot after the operation was held in a vast white studio. Harry, his vision now painfully sharp, could see every detail: the dust motes dancing in the harsh light, the faint sheen of sweat on the makeup artist’s brow, the hungry glint in Mr Aethelred’s magnified eyes behind the camera.



“Don’t smile,” Mr Aethelred instructed, his voice a hushed command. “Just look. Look directly into the lens. Let them see you.”



Harry did. He let the world fall away, retreating to the quiet place inside. He thought of nothing. He simply was. And with his new, unclouded eyes, the effect was electric. The camera shutter clicked like a frantic heartbeat.



The resulting photographs were not merely pictures of a boy; they were portraits of an ideal. The “Adonis” campaign, as Mr Aethelred named it, was launched with a whisper that quickly became a roar. The images were everywhere. Harry’s face, pale and serious, with those startlingly green, perfectly focused eyes, stared out from the pages of high-end fashion magazines that Petunia would never have dared buy, but now did, just to see the cheques that had made them possible.



He wasn’t just modelling clothes anymore. He was selling a feeling. A mood of ethereal, otherworldly beauty. He was the face of “Ethereal” by a new perfume house, pictured in a misty forest, looking like a lost changeling prince. He was the star of a painfully chic advertisement for minimalist Swedish furniture, sitting alone in a vast, white room, his expression one of profound loneliness that somehow made you want to buy the chair he was perched on.



The Dursleys’ world transformed alongside his. The cheques grew to sums so large even Vernon was rendered speechless, his bluster replaced by a kind of stunned, respectful greed. A new, larger conservatory was built. Dudley got a second television for his bedroom. Questions were no longer asked. When Harry was collected by the silent, black car for a shoot on the Scottish moors or a seaside location in Cornwall, it was treated not with suspicion, but with the solemnity of a business executive leaving for an important meeting.



At school, Harry Potter became a ghost. His classmates, who had always ignored the odd boy in the oversized clothes, now stared at him with a new, confused curiosity. The rumours swirled. “Is that him?” “In the magazine my mum reads?” “He looks… different.” He was left utterly alone, which suited him perfectly. He had long since learned that attention was a dangerous thing.



The only unpleasantness came from Dudley, but even that had changed. His taunts of “sissy” and “poof” had lost their venom, replaced by a sullen, bewildered jealousy. He couldn’t understand how his freak of a cousin, who lived in a cupboard, could be the source of the new computer currently sitting in his own bedroom. The injustice of it left him speechless with rage, which manifested in silent, glowering hatred across the breakfast table.



But for Harry, the studio was his reality. The world of Privet Drive was a dream, a grey, miserable interlude between shoots. Mr Aethelred’s obsession became his compass. The man’s praise was his only currency of affection.



“Exquisite, my dove.” “They all want you. Everyone wants a piece of my Adonis.” He was given books on art history, shown pictures of classical statues and Renaissance paintings, and told to emulate their grace.



Harry, starved for any shred of knowledge or beauty, devoured it all. He learned about light and shadow. He learned how to hold his body to appear both strong and fragile. He became a prodigy not of magic, but of performance. He could conjure a tear on command, a trick that made art directors gasp. He could produce a smile so fleeting and sad it broke hearts.



He was nine years old and the most famous child model in Britain. And yet, he was more invisible than ever. The boy in the photographs wasn’t Harry Potter. He was “Adonis.” A construct of light, fabric, and the desperate yearning of a lonely, neglected child who had found that the only way to be seen was to become a beautiful object.



He would lie awake in his cupboard, now filled with a faint, lingering smell of the expensive, citrus-scented wax they used in his hair, and practice the faraway look in the dark. He was waiting, though he didn’t know for what. Perhaps for the next shoot. The next cheque. The next soft word from Mr Aethelred.



The magical world had forgotten him, and in its place, the Muggle world had turned him into a different kind of fairy tale. One with a very handsome price tag.

  
CH2:

The success of the “Adonis” campaign, while financially magnificent, began to create a logistical problem for the Dursleys. The glossy schedules from Aethelred & Associates were becoming increasingly demanding, often clashing with the rigid timetable of St Gregory’s Primary School.



Aunt Petunia found herself perpetually writing notes. “Harry has a dentist appointment.” “Harry is unwell.” “A family matter requires his attention.” The school secretary had started to give her suspicious looks.



The solution arrived, as all things did now, in a thick, expensive envelope. Mr Aethelred requested another meeting at Privet Drive. This time, he did not decline tea. He sat, back straight, on the Dursleys’ best sofa, and laid out his proposal with the air of a CEO delivering a corporate takeover.



“The boy’s potential is being stifled,” he began, stirring his tea with a precise little spoon he had brought in his own pocket. “The… interruptions to his education are becoming untenable. And the school environment is so terribly common. It coarsens him.”



Vernon shifted uncomfortably. “The school? Perfectly good school! Took Dudley right through!”



“Precisely,” said Mr Aethelred, with a thin, dismissive smile. “I propose we withdraw him entirely. I will arrange for a private tutor. A former Oxford don, highly discreet. He will ensure Harry receives a… more suitable education. One that complements his development. Literature. Art history. French. It will broaden his emotional range, his ability to interpret a brief.”



Petunia’s eyes lit up. Private tutoring sounded vastly more prestigious than St Gregory’s. It was the sort of thing the right sort of people did.



“Furthermore,” Mr Aethelred continued, his voice dropping into a more confidential tone, “the constant travel between this… house… and my studio is disruptive. The boy needs a space to retreat. To find his centre before a shoot. I have had a room prepared for him at the studio. A place of quiet. Where he can be surrounded by beauty, not…” He gestured vaguely at the Dursleys’ loud, patterned wallpaper. “…distraction.”



Vernon’s first instinct was to refuse. Keeping the boy under his roof, under his thumb, was a point of principle. But the principle was rapidly crumbling under the weight of the numbers Mr Aethelred was now calmly outlining. The retainer would be doubled to compensate for the “domestic adjustment”. All tutoring fees would be covered. It was, in essence, a promotion for Harry, and a mammoth pay rise for them.



“Well!” Vernon blustered, his moustache quivering. “I suppose… if it’s for the boy’s… career…”



“It is,” Mr Aethelred said smoothly. “It is entirely for the career.”



The matter was settled with terrifying speed. Harry was summarily withdrawn from St Gregory’s. Dudley, for once, was genuinely upset—not because he would miss his cousin, but because he could no longer boast to his friends that his freak was in all the magazines. Now it was just a boring fact.



The following week, Harry was driven to the studio for what he thought was another shoot. Instead, Mr Aethelred led him to a door at the back of the main space, a place he had always assumed was a storage cupboard.



“This is for you, my dove,” Mr Aethelred said, opening the door. “Your sanctuary.”



The room was small, but unlike anything Harry had ever known. The walls were painted a soft, calming grey. A beautiful, if small, wrought-iron bed with a white duvet was pushed against one wall. There was a bookshelf filled with leather-bound classics and books on art. A small, elegant desk held a crystal carafe of water and a single, fresh white rose in a vase. There were no windows, but the lighting was soft and warm. It was pristine, quiet, and utterly controlled.



“You may rest here between sessions. Your tutor will come here. You can prepare. You can be away from all the… noise.” Mr Aethelred’s hand rested on Harry’s shoulder, a possessive weight. “This is where you belong now. With the beautiful things.”



Harry stepped inside. The air smelt faintly of lavender and lemon polish. It was the exact opposite of his dark, spider-filled cupboard. This was a room designed for a precious object. A gilded cage.



He looked at the clean bed, the beautiful books, the perfect rose. He thought of the grinding boredom of school, of Dudley’s gang, of weeding the garden in the rain. He thought of the Dursleys’ relentless, contemptuous normality.



A slow, cold understanding settled over him. He was being moved from one prison to another. But this new prison was so much more comfortable. It was quiet. It was his. And it came with the one thing he craved more than freedom: the undivided attention and approval of the only person who seemed to think he was worth anything.



“Thank you, Mr Aethelred,” he said, his voice barely a whisper.



The man smiled, a slow, satisfied expression. “You are welcome, my Adonis. You are finally home.”

I have been working on figuring out my caffeine intake. I made the mistake of picking up the four sigmatic half caff product which contains ashwaganda. I feel a bit dumb for doing that, but at least it’s early on. 

I have now picked up the Allegro half calf coffee. When reviewing, it says one serving is two tablespoons of coffee with 6 oz of water, making it land at 50 mg of caffeine. 

However, 6oz of water is about half a cup of coffee, so I’ve been doing 10oz of water per serving, making two cups of coffee in total. 

My ratio has have been doing 4 tablespoons with 20 ounces of water. 

Math wise, are we in agreement that would still be only 100 mg of caffeine? Because while I am adding more water, I am only adding two servings of the coffee amount. Let me know if that stand correct, or if I’m really already drinking like 150 mg of coffee given their water amount in their serving size is 6 ounces and I’m drinking about 18 ounces a day.",0,1758323488.0,BabyBumps,0,0.5,False

What's a normal expectation to have, if any?","I(26f) stayed in the US for a month and during my final week, met a guy ""Q"" (30) while I was out. He was hanging out with his group of friends, of which one of them (A) invited me to join them. 
We got along really well, he made me laugh the entire night, we joked around, took the piss out on each other, and by the end of the night told me he thought I was pretty. Then as I was about to leave, got invited to their ""afterparty"" which was just us eating tacos at A's place. 

Q and I spend the rest of the night sitting together the table just talking about certain experiences, making fun of each other, having deeper conversations, till we were close to leaving around 4am. At that point I joked whether he was gonna take me on a date, to which he said he wouldn't, I was gonna forget about him within a week. ""Maybe in a different lifetime"" he said. Later I learned that he told one of the other girls there that he ""didn't want to waste my time, taking me on a date"" knowing I was going to leave the country the next week. I respected that, was actually happy about that consideration, and accepted his words. 
He held me for a long time before we went our separate ways. I was ready for that to be the only time to see him.

Fast forward a few days later, we are texting on instagram, just random banter, before he tells me the most he could expect from me was a coffee together before leaving. I asked if he was asking me on a date, to which he said he was working on getting there. When I asked why he changed his mind, he wrote that he felt like it would be a mistake not to. ""You're leaving soon, which means, you have so little time left and it's a little selfish but I feel like I'm gonna miss out on something here if I don't see you before I might never see you again"". He cleared his schedule for the next day, and we spend the rest of my time at his place together.

He invited me over, telling me he didn't want his proposal to come across as an expectation, but would like to spend as much time with me as possible and truthfully, I felt the same way. It felt right to just be together, watch a movie, hang out, eat dinner together, etc. Which is what we did. 

We ended up in bed together, but didn't have sex. I didn't want that and later explained I didn't want any good memory of him to be clouded by the idea that it was just for sex, he respected that. We made out. About which he said, a kiss was the only expectation he hoped for, which we had exceeded beyond.

The next day Q made coffee, stayed with me for a little longer, then brought me back to my place, gave me his number and whereas before I was ready for it to be over, I now was no longer ready to leave and dreaded to go. 

In his hurry to get to work, gave me a kiss, then walked off and I started my journey home. 

Since then (17 days ago), we've texted almost every day. We've videocalled once and talked on the phone once, but everything else has been over text. The banter has pretty much stopped, which I miss and asked him about to which he responded that banter wasn't as fun for him if he couldn't hear me laugh. 

I know he's busy and we have a 6h time difference, but sometimes I don't hear from him for the entire day and it makes me worried that I'm doing too much or he's not actually interested/ he's dating someone.

What bothers me most is the fact that he has talked about sex with me a couple times now, and suggested we should try something over FaceTime sometime, while the ocean was keeping us apart. I told him I wasn't comfortable with that idea and he said he only suggested it because I told him I would help him ""de-stress"" sometime. Then the second time send me a video of himself getting horned up. 

Now, I understand that teasing and playfulness and sexy things can be fun in an LDR, but as far as I am aware, we're not actually dating. (I don't think he feels that way) and considering we only met 3 weeks ago and barely know each other, I can hardly imagine this being a priority when you're just getting to know someone and interested in seeing/dating them.

When I asked about what he wanted from me, he said he was interested in me and hoped I would come back or would make his way to me, but considering I've had people tell me this before, I'm taking it with a grain of salt. 
He told me he was attracted to me, both physically and mentally and that he felt pretty positive about getting to see each other again, knowing I want to move to his country. 

Then two days ago, I told him I wasn't comfortable with the sexual stuff he was suggesting and then said he didn't mean for that to become a thing. That he likes me and that he hate that we live so far apart and deal with time difference, that he wants to talk to me basically all day and that he's bumped out about the fact that he can't, etc.

When I asked to call, he did, but never initiates it himself. He rarely asks personal questions (whereas he did before we watched a movie at his place) and sometimes doesn't respond to me for a day (or longer). Even though he seems to have valid reasons (his phone had to get repaired/ he got sick/ he works fulltime) I still feel like those things don't keep someone from texting a simple short message, just to let you know they're alive. (He told me he crashed in a motorcycle accident once, so him being alive is an actual concern I have lol). And aside from that I feel like I am constantly triggered by the idea that he just wants to have sex, whenever brought up.

Again, we're not actually dating, but I don't know what it is that we are doing. I doubt he sees this as anything exclusive, but I hate the idea that we wouldn't be, considering the things he's been saying and the kind of contact we've been having.
I felt confident for the most part of our interactions, but given my history of emotionally unavailable, married men trying to get into my pants... I feel incredibly at loss of understanding about what's going on, what I should expect, and if any of you see any red flags that I'm missing here (that aren't mine) or if I'm just crazily overthinking this. 

I don't know if it's just trauma response or my intuition telling me he's not actually interested and I just can't tell. Have any of you had experiences like these?

I'm 22F for context. I tend not to push my own theories onto doctors but have suspected the possibility of POTS for a while. My current GP came to the conclusion of potential POTS recently and I have been referred to a cardiologist for further testing. I also have an endocrine referral in waiting. I have no clue how long until I can actually see the cardiologist.   
I'm having to spend atleast half of my days laying down atm and am trying to impliment as many life style changes I can on the assumption that the POTS suspicion is accurate. Prior to this I was already implementing some strategies/trying to implement them which felt affirming in the suspicions (eg. getting a reclining seat, editing my desk setup so I can be cross legged, having access to lots of spaces to lay down when needed, sitting on the floor more often. Recently got a shower chair (okay, an ikea stool) and it's a game changer).   
I guess ***I'm looking for advice on lifestyle changes I can make in lieu of this waitlist/pending confirmation of diagnosis business*** (so sick of waitlists). I'm looking into a light level of compression socks but this is what prompted this post - is it a good idea when I'm still pending confirmation that it \*is\* pots? From home testing I've examined blood pressure drop and raise of heart rate on standing (doc also tested this but not to the full length of the stand test which I may DIY for my own curiosity).

Even if there's a 50% drawdown in the equity markets, I'll be able to manage a 4% WR.

1nli9ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nli9ix/asked_a_guy_out_and_im_confused/,Asked a guy out and I’m confused,"So I met this guy last weekend at a club. We spent the night together and kissed but did not do anything sexual. Talked a bit and he seemed very nice. 

After that, two days passed and I figured I would just ask him out for a coffee for this weekend. This was Wednesday. He replied quickly and said that unafortunaly he was traveling this weekend but he would like to next week. 

After that he’s barely responding, like once a day if even that. When he responds he continues to conversation, and asks me question, like what am I gonna do in the weekend and on. 

I can see that he is active a lot more than he is answering me, and usually I would just directly think he is not interested but I just find it weird that he keeps the conversation going and said yes to a date but still is so slow to respond. 

I know that I’m not mentally well to overthink this so much but I’m not used to asking guys out and now I’m just very confused. One part of me just wants to remove him and the other to wait and see if he actually suggests a date next week. 

What do you guys think? 

Would be very thankful for your opinions on this!

1nli4q3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nli4q3,PDM Samples,"I just got into fragrances a couple years ago after I started seeing YouTube videos about the best fragrances. One of the first niche brands that I heard about was Parfums de Marly, and I ordered their sample set pretty quickly. 

I ended up ordering a 75 ml bottle of Perseus with my coupon from the sample set, and I still love that scent. It's my favorite summer fragrance so far. 

Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised when they sent me a free sample of Castley, when they were first releasing it. I hadn't ordered anything, and they just sent it to me unprompted.

Do any of you know if they're going to send out samples of these three new extrait fragrances, that are going to be released soon?  I got a notification about a package being sent to me, but I haven't ordered anything and I'm hoping that's what it is.

I am not a barista. But I am head of my roller derby team's Fundraising Committee. We had the awesome idea of getting one of our local coffee shops to run a promotion for our team to raise funds. We would provide the coffee shop with a drink recipe and name it after our team. Then, for every one of those drinks sold, a dollar amount gets donated to the team (like $1 or $2 per drink). I live in Wasilla, Alaska, so there are coffee shops on every corner with every flavor syrup imaginable. Lots of people drink iced coffee, but also Lotus drinks. 

Our team name is Denali Destroyers, so I was thinking of naming the drink ""The Denali"" or ""The Denali Destroyer"". Our team colors are green and purple, so I'd love to find a Lotus drink that uses those colors! Then we can also put our sticker on the cup.

I’m on lamictal and Keppra (clonazepam as an emergency med). I’ve had really scary symptoms so we started titrating off Keppra and adding in clobazam (onfi). I couldn’t get below 1000mg of Keppra without experiencing symptoms so now I’m on all three. I felt great and was symptom free for 1 whole week and then got slammed with symptoms while getting coffee with a friend. All of a sudden it felt like I couldn’t focus my eyes (that was new for me), my whole body felt off, and I knew the moment I stood my legs would be uncoordinated. I took a clonazepam but when I stood up to give her a hug I basically stumbled right into her and felt like I was going to fall over. Idk how to even describe how I feel, it’s just that my entire body feels off. I love my neurologist but it takes awhile to hear back from her. I can’t drive so it’s hard to see friends and family and I’m just feeling really isolated and bummed with the unknown. Im a nurse and I’m so scared of having a seizure in front of my patients but also afraid of hitting my head and all the other fun stuff that comes along with seizures. Mostly I’m just wondering how other people deal. I know I’m lucky in the realm of epilepsy and that it’s been fairly controlled up until now, but I hate feeling out of control of my own body, not seeing friends and being afraid to see them at the same time, and just the general fear. I guess I’m just looking for other stories and anyone who can relate. ",2,1758322559.0,Epilepsy,8,1.0,False

Went away after about a week and half, did take an antiviral, though a few days after the rash appeared.

The rash was on my left shoulder.  Lots of throbbing pain in the area: scapula, whole shoulder, down into the hand.

Now a month later, my front deltoid (front of the shoulder) is actually getting more painful, and combined with weakness, I have trouble even raising my arm in front of me.  Picture raising a cup of coffee straight ahead of you.

If I push my arm up past about the level point of rotation, then I can lift the arm higher.

Anyone else experience this?  I did have some issues with this shoulder before.  Bicep tendonitis probably.  I wonder if the shingles made it worse, or the nerve sensitivity is making existing pain perceived by my brain as much worse.",2,1758322473.0,shingles,0,1.0,False
