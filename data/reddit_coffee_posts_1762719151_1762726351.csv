1oswcwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oswcwn/sp_ur_the_cost_of_everything/,[SP] [UR] The Cost Of Everything,"**The Cost of Everything.**

The rain came down in sheets, a cold, slick rain turning to ice.

Footsteps clicked against the concrete.

A man moved through the alley, trench coat unfastened. No hat. No umbrella. He didn’t seem to notice the cold.

A woman huddled against the wall, small and shaking, her breath ragged white in the dark. She lifted her hands, a reflex more than a plea.

“You need more than spare change, girl,” he said.

Her hands fell. Even that small effort drained her.

The man stood over her, studying. “Tell me. What brought you here?”

She looked up. “Bad fortune,” she managed to whisper.

He smirked — without joy. “Drugs?”

A nod.

“Can you stand?”

Another nod.

“Come on,” he said softly. “Let’s get you out of the rain.”

She began to move, limbs trembling from effort, or maybe just the cold. Warm hands lifted her.

One step, her knees gave out, but she didn’t fall.

The next thing she knew, the rain was gone. The air was still. She was somewhere warm.

Somewhere dry.

The air felt thicker in here. A smell of vanilla, and something sour underneath, burnt maybe, like sugar left to scorch.

A dish clattered, sharp in the quiet, snapping her attention.

The man stood beyond a half wall, sleeves rolled, doing something she couldn’t see.

Without looking up, he spoke. “How long since you last used?”

She swallowed. Her mouth felt like sand.

“Day? Two, maybe.”

“You sure?”

“No.” She gave a thin laugh that died quick. “I stopped keeping score after the first dozen times I quit.”

He nodded, as if she’d said something ordinary.

“That’s good,” he said. “Knowing you’ve quit before.”

“Didn’t stick.”

“Nothing does, at first.”

She looked around the room. The warmth made her shake harder.

“You a preacher or something?”

“Something,” he said.

He reached up and took a mug from a shelf. Porcelain, chipped. The sound of it on the counter was louder than it should have been.

“You got coffee?” she stammered.

“I do,” he said. “But it’s not free. Nothing is.”

“I don’t have anything.”

“What would it be worth to you?”

She blinked, confused. Then her eyes narrowed. The question didn’t sound like a threat, but it didn’t sound safe either.

“Worth?” she said. “Look, mister, I’ll need more than a cup of coffee for that. Twenty, no, fifty bucks.”

He looked up at her finally. “No. Not that.”

“They all say that,” she muttered. “At first.”

He crossed the room, mug in hand, and set it on the little table in front of her.

“There it is,” he said. “Is it worth a song?”

“A song? What do you mean?”

“Just that. A song. Sing for it.”

She shook her head, uncertain if he was joking.

“Any song,” he said. “That’s my price.”

It began very soft, barely audible.

“Twinkle… twinkle… little star…”

Her voice cracked on the second line. She hadn’t realized how long it had been since she’d sung anything. The words came halting, like someone remembering how to breathe.

The last *how I wonder what you are* came out as a whisper.

“That’ll do,” he said.

She sat shuddering, the cold, the drugs, or this man. She didn’t know.

“You have a cigarette?”

“Do I look like I smoke?”

She glanced at the ashtray on the table.

He reached into his pocket and came up with a pack, a plain white, no brand she recognized.

“Lucky day,” he said, setting it down.

She blinked. “Thought you didn’t smoke.”

“I don’t.”

“Then what’s…” She trailed off, just accepted what he offered.

The match flared without her seeing him strike it. For a second the light caught his face, sharp and unreadable, then was gone.

She drew in deep, eyes closing, the burn settling her. “God,” she said, smoke slipping out with the word. “That’s worth everything.”

He studied her for a long time. “Everything,” he said quietly. “People use that word like it’s small.”

She gave a cracked laugh. “When you’re this far gone, even smoke feels like a blessing.”

His face hardened. “Do you understand that word?”

She only stared, a confused expression.

“Everything,” he said again, slower this time. “I told you, nothing is free. So you’d give me your memories for it? Your joy? Your fear? You’d trade all of that? For something as small as a drag on a cigarette?”

The room went still after he said it.

She couldn’t tell if the heat had kicked higher or if it was just her pulse. The smoke tasted wrong now, bitter and old.

She set the cigarette down and wrapped her arms around herself, keeping her eyes on the cup “Forget it,” she muttered. “You talk like a cop or a priest. Either way, it’s never good news.”

She watched the acrid smoke curl upward, the gray threads fading into the dark.

He didn’t seem angry, or even interested. He just stood there for a moment, then turned back toward the small kitchen.

“Bathroom’s over there,” he said at last. “I’m afraid I don’t have any women’s clothes, but I set something out for you.”

She couldn’t remember seeing him go inside.

“And what’s that cost?” she asked.

He didn’t look up. “A story,” he said. “Yours.”

She gave a rough laugh. “A story, huh? You want a bedtime one or the kind that keeps you up nights?”

He didn’t answer. The silence stretched until it felt like pressure in her chest.

“Fine,” she said. “Once upon a time there was a girl who thought she could stop whenever she wanted. Spoiler, she couldn’t.”

He still said nothing.

She stared down at her hands. Nails dirty, knuckles raw. “You ever wake up and not know what city you’re in? Or whose coat you’re wearing?”

His voice came low. “Keep going.”

“There’s not much left. I ran out of endings a while ago.” She rubbed her thumb along the cup’s rim. “It’s just a loop now. Use, sleep, beg, repeat. The circle of my life like the kid’s movie.”

When she looked up, he was watching her the way people watch fire, close enough to feel the heat, not enough to get burned.

“That enough for your shower?” There was a hint of anger in her voice.

“More than enough,” he said. “I’ll toss in the couch for the trouble.”

She didn’t wait for him to change his mind. The bathroom door closed behind her with a tired click.

The light flickered when she turned the knob, buzzing like some trapped insect.

The water came out brown at first, then clear, steaming. She stared at it, at the way it pooled around the drain.

She stepped under, clothes and all. The first hit was cold, then warm, then hot enough to sting. She let it. It soaked through her hair, her skin, down to the bone. She stayed until her knees went weak.

At last, she peeled the clothes away, heavy and dark, and let the water take the rest.

When she opened the door, the room was still warm, but quieter somehow.

The smell of burnt sugar was gone, replaced by something else, mold, or maybe just age.

A bowl sat on the table. Soup, thick, simple, still steaming. Next to it, a folded scrap of paper and a few bills held down by a matchbox. Her cigarette lay beside it, burned to the filter.

She touched the paper with damp fingers.

*St. Luke’s Rehabilitation*  
*43 Isaiah Avenue · Suite 1819*

The handwriting was neat, steady.

She thumbed the bills, small ones, enough for a ride and maybe a coffee after.

She looked around. No coat on the hook. No sound from the kitchen. The room felt hollow.

She ate the soup slow. When it was gone, she pocketed the note and the money.

Then she stepped into the cold. The rain had stopped.",1,1762726150.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

I’m drawn to people who notice details that others might overlook, who carry calm with them but have a spark that shows up when you least expect it. Someone who can find meaning in small things and doesn’t rush what deserves time.

I’m 27 and from England. I run my own business, which keeps me busy but gives me the freedom to live at my own pace. My mornings begin with coffee and my dogs before the world really wakes. I love cooking and baking, sometimes to unwind and sometimes just for the pleasure of creating something simple and good. Film photography has become a quiet habit, a way of paying attention to moments that might otherwise pass unnoticed. Being outdoors helps me reset, whether it’s walking, running, or sitting still long enough to notice how the light changes.

I appreciate people who are genuine and emotionally aware, who know how to be both steady and surprising. I believe real connection builds through curiosity, humour, and shared quiet. It’s not about perfection, just about showing up with a bit of honesty and interest in the person in front of you.

Where you are doesn’t matter. If you are reading this, it means I am still looking, hoping to meet someone who feels the same pull toward something calm, genuine, and a little bit electric in its simplicity.",1,1762726103.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

I have the attention span of a jittery monkey raised on an iPad. I have the attention span of a Redditor when faced with a giant wall of text. I don’t know why. I think a scary creepypasta monster is puppeting me. 

I decided to find out once and for all why I can’t focus. Maybe a demon knew why.

I cleared the coffee table and couches from my living room to make space on the hardwood floor. I started to draw a demonic star, but as I was halfway through it, I couldn’t focus anymore.

The ritual still somehow worked. Half of a portal opened on the floor, and a demon squeezed half of its body up out of the portal like a mole waiting to get whacked.

“Why did you summon me,” said the demon. His voice sounded demonic. Go figure.

“Can you tell my why I can’t focus?” I got on my knees to be level with him. “Please, demon! Please! I need to know!”

“Maybe if you got rid of that ol’ yee yee ahh haircut you got you’d get some attention span on your dick. Better yet, maybe if you stopped doomscrolling every waking hour of the day maybe you could focus better.”

“Oh… true.”

The demon disappeared and the portal followed shortly after.

I have recently done the via survey, (personality test,that shows your character strengths)

My top character strengths are: Kindness, curiosity, humility, appreciation for beauty & excellence

So i have difficulty differentiating between, kindness, caring, helping, saving someone and being sexually attracted to someone.

Overr the past few weeks I have been attending some in person adhd support groups in my city.

I have started to get very friendly with a girl that also goes there. Whenever we have one to one conversations there is chemistry and I'm very relaxed around her. When we are standing and chatting I've noticed that there is lots of mirroring, so I know if it's chemistry or mirroring.

I've finally almost completely recovered from burnout and I'm far more happier than I have over the past few years. I'm currently taking an extended break ( one year ) to focus on myself and not be entirely focused on my career. It has been a great idea.

She is also on a career break and considering switching careers. So over the past few weeks, she and I have been meeting up for coffees, and these would typically last for about 2 hours, maybe more.

There has not been anything more than long chats, nothing more than that in terms of intimacy.

The issue I have is that I don't want to tell her how I feel about her. Because she is at a point in her life where she is trying to figure out what career she wants and I don't want to add to her troubles.

Also she is currently in a relationship and I don't want to mess with her head.

She really enjoys these in person adhd events and I fear that if I tell her how I feel, she will feel awkward around me at these events and she will be more hesitant about going to these events.

I'm just terrified that someday in the future, I will see her with her boyfriend and I will be devastated, because I will realise  that I'm attracted to her.

In the past when I was in serious relationships, I would prioritise my significant other and if I was dating her I would do the exact same thing again.

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer*, but I will read and evaluate all participants.  

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise more recent posts.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""One way or another, we'll find our way home""  
**A2)** ""The problem I mentioned is that I might've lost my sleeping bag""  
**A3)** ""Will you shut the fuck up?"" (I realised I've never really included swearing in my exercises before, but it is part of the language)

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)  
**Estimated answer time**: 1 day (for those submitting now)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all six sentences, I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes without evaluating.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of scores depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the exact range might change depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

It was one of those times when Bill preferred not to go outside because of how cold it was, but Tracy wanted his porch smoke. 

“Here.” Bill tossed him the Marlboros as he stepped out. Tracy barely caught it with the edges of his palms. 

“Jesus, Bill…”

“Sorry.”

Tracy handed him a cigarette. “So I wasn’t exactly in the mood today, but…nature calls.”

“Nature calls?” Bill took a long drag and looked at Tracy. “I’m not sure that makes any sense to me.”

“You’re not good with words like I am.”

“Alright.”

The sun started going down and mosquitoes came out. Tracy stayed quiet other than the occasional wet snort Bill mostly tuned out. 

“I can’t remember the last time I saw Delaney,” Tracy said after a bit.

“No?”

“No, not really.” 

Bill stubbed out his cigarette. He was done. He clasped his hands over the porch railing. Tracy side-eyed him. 

“Another?” Bill asked. 

Tracy nodded once and told him ‘yeah.’ Bill tossed him the pack. “Thanks.” 

Tracy nursed the second cigarette before letting out a long sigh. “Yeah, no,” he said. 

“No?”

“I don’t remember.” 

“Oh.”

Tracy wagged the cigarette in between two fingers. “Just remember Gene telling me she’d done the rolling around in the closet for a few days before,” he said.

“Rolling around in the closet? What does that mean?”

“You know, rolling around in the closet.”

“I really don’t know what that means,” Bill said.

Tracy sighed. “I can’t really explain what he said. She’d been rolling around in her bedroom closet crying, I guess. Rolling around on the floor.”

Bill was quiet. The wind started to pick up, and he could hear the chimes on the other side of the house. 

Tracy turned and looked at him again. Then he looked at his hand with the cigarette, and then again back at Bill. “You aren’t going to say anything?”

“I don’t really know what to say,” Bill said.

“Anything at all.” Tracy flicked ash and put the cigarette back to his mouth.

“I don’t know, man. Discussing the details seems pointless.”

“Mm.” Tracy’s eyes wandered sideways. “Well, I wanted to discuss the details, I guess, I don’t know.” He started wagging the cigarette again. “Sorry I brought it up.” He kept on wagging for a minute, then stopped. “Honestly, Bill, I’m getting tired of your god damned attitude.”

Bill didn’t say anything.

Tracy continued, “Your god damned attitude. Your god damned attitude. I can’t—“ He paused. “I can’t imagine how she felt when Aubrey finally said whatever it was that threw her off. Probably some, ‘You know what, Delaney, I don’t think this is working anymore, I need to stay professional.’ Aubrey’s never been professional, Bill. He’s a fucking con.”

Bill coughed on swallowed-wrong spit. The chimes went on.

“He’s a fucking con.”

Bill let out a long whistle and turned to go back in the house.

“You’re leaving already?” Tracy put out the cigarette and turned to face Bill. 

“Yes, I’m leaving. I’m not doing this right now.” Bill let the screen door fall shut behind him and wandered into the kitchen. 

Tracy went up to the screen. “You’re not doing this right now?”

“No.”

“You know, Bill, I’ve got to do this every day for the rest of my damned life because of your con dad. Your dad’s the biggest liar I’ve met in my life.” Tracy lit another cigarette. He took a drag and hacked.

“Goodnight, Tracy. I’m going to bed. Keep the pack.”

Tracy paced back and forth a few times. “‘I don’t need to smoke, I have self-restraint!’” He paced some more. “‘I’m better and smarter than everyone else!’ No, you’re not, Bill. You’re an idiot.” Bill crossed his arms and stared at the fridge. 

It was quiet after that besides a cricket chirping somewhere in the ceiling. Bill stayed put. He could see Tracy sat with his back up to the door for a while before he got up, tossed the pack at the door, and left.

The sun was down now. Bill opened and closed the fridge door several times before he started untying his shoes.

-

Aubrey pulled into the driveway. The lemon he drove made a decent amount of noise that would usually give Bill an extra few seconds to hide whatever magazines he’d brought out. There were no magazines today. 

Aubrey just grunted when he came through the door. That’s usually how it was. He’d glance over at Bill, make some kind of acknowledgement noise, and then go and rummage around in the fridge. Today wasn’t much different, other than him not rummaging long before giving Bill some kind of look.

“…What?”

Aubrey sighed. “There’s no stew,” he said. “I thought we had stew left over.”

“Um…I don’t know.” Bill put his feet up on the coffee table. “Last I saw there was some in there.”

“Well, I’m not seeing it. Either somebody ate it or it disappeared into thin air.”

“Well, I didn’t eat it, so I don’t know what to tell you.”

Aubrey closed the fridge. “Bill…” He rubbed his chin. Neither of them said anything for the next minute until Aubrey told him, “I need you to go to the store.”

“Alright.”

“I need you to get those small potatoes, and bacon, and coffee. Can you remember all that?”

“Yes.”

“Are you sure? Because last time you got the wrong potatoes and forgot half of what I asked you to get.”

“Yes, I can remember three things.”

“Do I need to write you a list?”

Bill just got up from the couch and walked out. The sun was setting now and much of the sky was a shade of brown he didn’t usually see.",1,1762725078.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1osvujb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1osvujb/my_brain_tricked_me/,My brain tricked me!!!!,"I swear I can’t make this up. I am so pissed I am going to self lobotomise myself? Yesterday afternoon I was taking a nap so I set my alarm to 1:30, presumably pm right? Then my mom woke me up 30 minutes AFTER my nap because she wanted me to have lunch. Ok. I spent the rest of my day trying to study chem but failing because of global warming. I literally felt my skin sizzling and crackling from the intense heat of the atmosphere. Greta thunberg is so right. This global warming is going to cook us alive one day. (Literally and figuratively) 

This morning, I woke up to my alarm dizzy and groggy. The sky was still dark, but it’s ok, because I slept at 10, intending to wake up early to study H1 chem. 

**COMMERCIAL BREAK** : ANY KIND SOUL WITH H1 CHEM SUMMARIES, PLEASE DO OFFER THEM IN THE COMMENTS!!!! I’m suffering so much with periodic table, organic chem and nano-materials that I myself am thinking what kinda flames I’ll turn into when I react with chlorine. 

I, a completely sane A levels student (who totally did not have a break down on Friday to Saturday because of blanking out on her math p2), have an unexpectedly healthy life habit. I do not look at my phone 30mins after I wake up and 30 mins before I sleep. A habit that I swore by my life to maintain BEFORE TODAY HAPPENED. After I brushed my teeth, made coffee and breakfast, I sat down at the living room table and started studying my h1 chem from scratch. My living room’s digital clock has coincidentally spoilt YESTERDAY, so it has been stuck at 7:09am. Yes, I could’ve checked the time with my computer or my phone, but I stubbornly chose to not because it would ‘break my discipline streak’. Why am I treating life like Duolingo I swear I am going to delete that stupid app. After what seemed like a tormenting 3 hours, I looked towards the east, where the sun is SUPPOSED TO RISE. It was not! I somehow looked towards the west because my mom always say that 太阳从西边出来了 whenever I score well for chem, but unfortunately, the sun did not seem to shine at all.

 I FINALLY decided something was off. Either I had the ability to stop time, or I’ve been transported to a different dimension when I was sleeping. But NO!!!! It was 5:30AM????? Oh HELL NAH. So it turns out I’ve set my alarm to 1:30am, don’t ask me why, I don’t know. While I had such a loving date with all of my h1 chem notes, time has ticked away faster than I thought as I freaked out over the sheer number of chapters which wanted my time. Believe me, my knees actually crumbled as I fell to the floor in shock. 

Anyways it’s now 5:47am and I spent 20minutes typing this out because I’m SO furious at myself. Now I’m going back to sleep. I am blaming all of this on chem. Anything I’ve studied for the past 4hours might’ve been reduced to naught because of how I wasted the last hour staring at the same set of notes and thinking about sleep. Goodnight warriors.

I’ve worked in coffee supply chains for 10+ years, and one question I’ve always gotten from friends is: “What’s the best coffee?”

My answer has always been the same: “It’s the one *you* enjoy the most.”

That idea inspired me to start building an app that makes it easy for people to discover and understand their own taste in coffee. After a few months in open beta, we just launched a new feature called the *Personal Taste Profile*. It shows you your top coffee styles, tracks which countries you’ve tried coffees from, and suggests others you might love next.

If you’re curious to see what your taste profile looks like (and help us improve the app), you can check it out here:

We've been talking a lot less and i thought she just got bored of me. we met again this summer at a friend's birthday, i got kind of drunk and I can get touchy/clingy so I was kind of clinging to her (from what i remember) but she genuinely didn't seem to mind. fast forward to like a few weeks ago, we were still barely texting and then she asked me when we were going to hang out and i was like ""i lowkey thought you hated me but im free whenever you are"". we agreed to meet up but before that another friend had a birthday party and we were both invited. I didn't know anyone except for her and 2 other people so I kind of spent the entire night with her. this time she got tipsy first and was also being touchy and stuff (sat/lied in my lap, held my hand like twice, had her arm linked with mine half the time) but im like 95% sure she's like that with everyone so i don't wanna read too much into that. anyway at some point my friend pulled me to the side and started questioning me about whether i like that girl, i said no, she kept insisting until i got visibly annoyed and she stopped. I wasn't lying either cause I'm still not sure if i like her but at that time i wasnt having thoughts like these. fast forward to when i was getting ready to leave, she (main subject) walked up to me and gave me a kiss goodnight on the cheek and I did too. ok cool, the day after, though, my friends started pushing their woke agenda on me and kept making comments about me and her. i found out they've been doing the same thing to her and she just laughs it off, which i interpreted as her being uncomfortable and wanting to change the subject (most definitely the case) but they chose to be delusional and start coming up with headcanons. fast forward again to the day we met up for some coffee then lunch. she got a call from my (our) friend, turned to me, asked if she and two others could come, I said ""sure"". then when friend found out shes with me they insisted that they'd just pass by to say hello and leave, which was weird to me cause you JUST said you'd join but sure wtv. when the arrived the other two sat down and they stayed for like what, 10 minutes? then friend kept urging them to get up and leave. i assume a bad attempt at ""hooking us up"". the thing is my head was full of my friends' comments that day cause they kept implying that she definitely likes me, but i didn't feel anything off in the atmosphere, i chatted with her the way i do with all my other friends.

The cornerstone of New York's Paraguayan diaspora serves delicious food

By Caroline Shin
Published Nov 9, 2025 at 11:01 a.m. ET

The entire dining room of I Love Paraguay was packed on a recent Saturday night. Surrounded by tangles of colorful flowers and vines adorning the walls, families and groups of friends dug into empanadas and parrillada (a grilled meat platter). A harpist serenaded two birthday parties.

For the 18 years since its opening in Sunnyside, Queens, the restaurant has remained dedicated to traditional Paraguayan food customs. It’s one of only a handful of Paraguayan restaurants in New York, whose scarcity reflects the community’s small numbers: only 4,210 people or 0.05% of the NYC population are Paraguayan.

It honors San Juan in June with month-long specials like chicharô hu’itï (fried pork with toasted cornflour). It facilitates the August 1st ritual of drinking carrulim that’s believed to cleanse the spirit and welcome health and fortune. I Love Paraguay brews its own with sugarcane liquor and ruda, an herb. It’s just closed out its October tradition of serving jopara (bean and white corn soup). And every day, it’s doling out classic Paraguayan soups, pastries, sandwiches, and pastas loaded with native ingredients like beef and cassava executed so well that the owners of the family-run institution say that the president of Paraguay has visited the restaurant.

In Asunción, the restaurant’s owner Nancy Ojeda fell in love with cooking as she watched her mom make the “most delicious food” for the family of five. She went on to study under renowned masters of Paraguayan cooking: Maria de los Angeles Villamayor and Aida de Hutteman.

Through the 1990s, she opened a French restaurant, a cantina (school-side snack shop for students) and a hamburger shop in Asunción. In 2002, she immigrated to the U.S. to fulfill even bigger dreams for her children. She first joined the Paraguayan American community in Westchester and in 2004 opened Little Paraguay: a deli with easy grab-and-go foods like pastries, sandwiches, and soups.

But Ojeda wanted to go even bigger and, in 2007, she launched I Love Paraguay, adding hot entrees to the same menu. She was recounting her business journey on a recent Monday afternoon and just as she was about to list her bestsellers, a couple, wheeling luggage, graciously interrupted her on their way out.

“Every time I come [to New York], I have to stop here,” Rafael Quinteros told Ojeda. “There’s nothing like it.”

This was his last stop before heading back home to Tampa, Florida. And like his other visits in the past seven years, he lugged a brown takeout bag containing his favorites: sopa Paraguaya (corncake) and marineras de carne (battered fried beef).

“People come here from all different parts of the country, and they want to take a piece of Paraguay home,” said Ojeda. “It’s like a consulate here.”

But this “consulate” also has a kitchen churning out some impeccably prepared food.

The hearts of palm empanadas are juicy with light, melty mozzarella and tangy from the palmitos.

The payagua mascada (cassava fritter) is made with beef blended so finely it’s hard to see but easy to taste. A thin, crackly crust holds together the soft mashed interior.

The marineritas are pillows of soft, fluffy dough around flattened pieces of beef.

For the house-made cocido (a caffeinated herbal drink usually consumed instead of coffee), yerba mate leaves are burned with sugar for a sweet, caramelized taste that rounds out the bitter, grassy herbs.

The pasta dishes here reflect a cultural fusion sparked by Italian immigration to Paraguay. The house-made gnocchi is served with a hearty beef stew featuring carrots, green and red peppers, tomatoes, garlic and big chunks of beef.

“Yeah, we’re big on meat,” explained Elizabeth Ojeda, restaurant manager and Nancy’s daughter-in-law.

In addition to the holiday specials, Ojeda keeps things exciting for customers. On a recent Saturday, the vori vori (soup with small balls of corn flour and cheese) sold out. Same for Monday’s minced beef soup.

“For me the most important thing is excellence,” said Nancy Ojeda. “I am very demanding of myself. I’m very perfectionist.”

That applies to the food — she won’t send out dishes that don’t meet her standard — but also the business.

“Running a restaurant is serious. It’s not just about opening a restaurant because you watched your mom cook.” She handles accounting, marketing, and e-commerce.

But the commitment to excellence stems from another mission that she holds dearly.

1osvl7h,https://i.redd.it/reivq2h6ra0g1.jpeg,"4 Supplements All Longevity Experts Take Every Day (Peter Attia, Huberman, Rhonda Patrick)","I don't really like supplements - they shift focus from what's more important, quite often are of bad quality or not proven to work in humans... but nevertheless they are one of the [**12 Pillars of Longevity**](https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1l2gpfl/12_necessary_steps_to_live_to_120_the_law_of/) because when you need them - you need them. (e.g. elevated homocysteine is not going to fix itself)   
  
The real question is how to find real gold in the tens of thousands ***unregulated*** pill boxes, bottles and jars.  
  
**The Supplement Framework** I use is the following:  
1) Can I get it naturally as a food?  
2) How strong is the HUMAN evidence ?  
3) Can I measure the impact (before and after) ?  
4) What are the risks and costs?  
5) Can I find a good quality source? (*I mostly stick to Thorne, Pure Encapsulation and Integrative Therapeutics*)

On top of that I did a deep research of what my favorite experts ~~say~~ do (Peter Attia and Rhonda Patrick) and added Huberman to even things out. Put that into a table ([xlsx file can be found here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/4-supplements-143147978)) and cross-referenced to the framework. 

So not everything me or experts use will be applicable to everyone, but if we look at the cross section we see some real winners:  
  
**1)** **Vitamin D3**:  
\- the sunshine is still quite important! [Video: avoid common vitamin D mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2DqW35FeY&list=PLq4OOzo28fwxnuRpPMWJvDjHaDDqNF4TU&index=12)  
\- optimal range is not really known, so measure and stay above the deficiency (*I aim at 50 ng/mL*)  
**-** D3 can be combined with K2 and should be taken with food  
  
**2)** **Omega-3:**  
\- start with fish, *SMASH*: salmon, makrel, anchovies, sardines, herring  
\- supplement to achieve 10-12% Omega Index  
\- triglyceride form is superior  
\- Omega 3 deep dive is here: [Video: How to 4x Fish Oil Benefits for the Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugqhBzeWByQ&list=PLq4OOzo28fwxnuRpPMWJvDjHaDDqNF4TU&index=3)  
  
**3)** **Magnesium:**  
\- start with greens, beans and nuts  
\- 2 most popular formulas are Magnesium L‑threonate (*Attia, Huberman*) and Magnesium Glycinate (*Rhonda*)

3.1) **Glycine**  
\- connective tissues or collagen are the good food source  
\- glycine can work as sugar [Video: New Best Sugar (In The Right Dose)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cfR-L8U_UY&list=PLq4OOzo28fwxnuRpPMWJvDjHaDDqNF4TU&index=13)  
  
3.2) **B6, B9, B12**   
**-** start from organ meats, eggs and beets  
\- target homocysteine to be in 6-8 µmol/L  
\- more about B vitamins: [Video: Feed Your Genes For Optimal Mood and Energy (Methylation Simplified)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYAux_Mr_vM&list=PLq4OOzo28fwxbeJ4ndmtkuRaeYqHQZdSd&index=8)  
  
**4)** **Creatine**  
\- start with 5g daily, if you are 200lb+ or can tolerate more go to 10g  
\- look for nsf certified creatine monohydrate  
\- avoid mixing with coffee on an empty stomach

I’m thinking of building an app where you could:

* Make “fantasy drafts” for reality shows
* Make live predictions about what happens next
* Compare your picks with friends
* See who actually called it as the drama unfolds
* (would also love it, if it can turn into full on watch parties at local sports bars - reality TV take over edition)

Basically, a way to make watching reality TV more interactive and competitive without anyone losing actual cash.

I’m looking to move to Columbus in the next few months and trying to get a sense of which neighborhoods might fit me best. I’m 40, recently out of a long relationship, no kids, and really looking to dive into a new chapter. I’ve still got a young-at-heart energy — I love a good mix of day and nightlife, checking out local restaurants, coffee spots, happy hour spots, easy access to outdoors, and just having things to do around me.

I’ll be bringing two cats, and ideally I’d like to find a place for $1200/month or less (not including utilities). I’m open to apartments, duplexes, or small houses — mostly just want something in a fun area where there’s a community vibe and things happening for my age range.

So far I’ve seen people mention places like Short North, Clintonville, German Village, and Grandview Heights, but I’m not sure which would actually feel right for someone in my shoes. My brother mentioned Old North Columbus, too. Any advice on where to look (or avoid), what areas have the best energy, or even good complexes to check out would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks in advance — and if you’ve made a similar move to Columbus for a fresh start, I’d love to hear how you liked it! I am originally from two hours east of Columbus, and was born in Zanesville. So somewhat familiar with Columbus, but haven't been since like 2009-ish, maybe 2010.

Over the last couple of years, our relationship has completely changed. She’s grown really distant and cold toward me.

She rarely shows affection anymore. When I tell her I love her, she either doesn’t respond or just says “okay.” If I try to talk about how that hurts, she says I’m “complaining about the same stuff” or acts like I’m starting a fight.

I’ve kept trying to show her I care, bringing her coffee, cleaning, helping with the kids, doing whatever I can to make things easier. But nothing changes. I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around someone who doesn’t even seem to like me anymore.

Last night was the breaking point for me. There was a small misunderstanding about something I said when I brought coffee earlier in the day that set a bad tone, and the coldness just kept going. I told her that I didn’t want her to be mad or upset and that the whole day had just felt off. She brushed it off, acting like I was imagining everything.

That’s when I finally said everything I’d been holding in, how her ignoring me, giving half-hearted affection, and shutting me out for so long has been tearing me apart. I told her that if I treated her the same way she treats me, it would hurt her too. She didn’t say much, just stayed quiet and gave me a half-assed kiss goodnight.

This morning she basically said she’s miserable and doesn’t want to be together anymore.

Now I’m sitting here wondering if I pushed too hard last night. I wasn’t yelling or being mean, I just couldn’t keep pretending everything was fine anymore. I still love her, but I feel completely empty.

1osv7sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1osv7sh/recent_trip_with_67yo_kids_play_by_play/,Recent trip with 6&7yo kids play by play,"Just had a delightful 7-day trip and wanted to report back some of the hot tips and experiences before I forget. I got some good tips off the posts in this sub. We are a family of 4 and our kids are 6 & 7 years old.

**Itinerary** 3 nights at Caves Branch near Belmopan; 1 night at Tropical Education Center (Belize Zoo); 3 nights on Caye Caulker.

_Saturday: ✈️ arrival in Belize City. Some tips:_

- it *takes forever to get out of the airport* after you land because you have to wait to have your bag scanned, then speak to an agent. Two hours of standing in line. Choose the far left lane while waiting for an agent; thank me later.

- *rented a car* from Crystal Auto. We booked this in advance. The car rental pickup is very close to the airport exit doors. $300ish for the 5 days

- arrived at Ian Anderson’s Caves Branch. Place was heavenly. Stayed in a Riverview cabin (#19) because we didn’t want to walk very far to the room with the 2 little kids. Bring ear plugs if you don’t like the jungle noises at night (I loved it!)

_Sunday: 🌿🦜Caves Branch (River cave tour)_

- they pick you up in a truck, drive you to a short walk to the river which you float down toward the caves. Saw several monkeys. Then you enter the cave, and it’s about 70% on tubes and 30% at stops looking at Mayan artifacts, and learning about cave animals/geology. You eat lunch at the end of the cave and float back the other direction. Overall about 4 hours.

- bring close-toed water shoes, else you will be in your sneakers. The rainforest is humid so it took 2 days for mine to dry

-  Bring something waterproof to put your camera/phone in. They have a dry sack but you won’t be able to easily access your camera for photos unless it’s on your person. I bought a waterproof purse satchel thing that was perfect for this

- you do not have to book the tours in advance of arriving; each night at dinner someone walks around and asks what you are doing the next day and helps you choose something if you haven’t already
- the kids had absolutely no problem at ages 6 &7 and loved the tour. The water was never deep enough that they couldn’t just walk at any moment, and there were helmets, lifejackets and even kid-sized tubes for them. It was, however, an adventure tour - make no mistake of it being a “kiddy” activity

_Monday: Caves branch (Horseback riding)_

- We booked this the night before through Caves Branch and did just the horseback riding (not the zip lining combo) which is at green acres ranch. 2 hours from start to finish.

- best horseback riding “trail” ride I’ve ever done- you’re going across rivers, through jungle, and they even let you trot toward the end. Bring bug spray, but it wasn’t like we were constantly swatting them away; we had only a couple bites between the 4 of us. Two guides, including one who made sure the kids’ horses got back on track. They offered helmets but we declined so I can’t confirm whether they would have fit kids

- Spent the afternoon in the pool (kids) at Caves Branch, lounging and listening to the birds (parents)

_Tuesday: Caves Branch (Botanical gardens) + Belmopan market, TEC Belize Zoo (nocturnal animals’ tour)_

- did the botanical gardens tour in the morning before we left Caves Branch. The guide made it surprisingly interesting for the kids; he showed us a half-dozen plants you can eat, hilighted interesting plant facts. Could tell he loved the jungle. They have a couple little demo visuals set up throughout the tour. This is where we got the most mosquito bites - wear bug spray. They have an orchid collection that requires everyone to be careful as some are rare finds

- out by 11; drove rental car and stopped for lunch in *Belmopan. There is a market on Tuesdays and Saturdays* so we grabbed some food from a vendor. Good authentic vibes there. Small underwhelming playground. Bring cash.

- stopped at Laminai chocolate. The owner said she is in the midst of a rebrand to “Zoey’z”. No chocolate fruit is ripe is November so we didn’t do a tour. Was fine to kill time but without the tour not worth a detour

- arrived at **Tropical Education Center**, which is just across from (and affiliated with) the **Belize Zoo**. The rooms are underwhelming, as is the food. We stayed in “pine cabin” which has about 5 rooms in a row. They are air conditioned.  There is a decent, big protected pool (all you need when you have kids!) that they played in for a while. Not heated though - be warned! There is a cool leaf cutter ant colony snaking throughout the place. 10/10 would stay here again.

- Nocturnal animals’ tour at Belize Zoo.  Pickup at TEC; lasts about 90 mins. Veryyy good for the kids and adults alike. 

_Wednesday: TEC then Ferry to Caye Caulker; stayed at Iguana Reef Inn_

- dropped off car at Crystal auto; they also drive you to the ferry terminal as part of the rental. Overall good easy experience.

- ferry costs about the same at the dock as online. Boat was completely full though, so take that with a grain of salt.  Ferry terminal has a few shops and places to get basic snacks and sunscreen, plus one restaurant. You drop your luggage onto a trolley; they load it into the ferry.

- ferry is an hour. Sit where you’ll get a breeze. When you get off, you walk down the dock at Caye Caulker and wait for the luggage. Took maybe 5 mins; easy.

- 5-min walk to Iguana Reef Inn, you really don’t need a cart.

_Thursday: Caye Caulker / Iguana Reef Inn:_

- It’s the best hotel on the main part of the island I think, because it has the nicest pool and beachfront with a good bar. A lot of folks gather there around 4pm for the stingrays, and at night you can see Tarpons off their deck. For those of you with kids, I highly recommend room #9 as it’s right beside the pool and is also the closest one to the beach (on the main floor). 
- continental breakfast is included but it’s really not much; it is served to you by someone and you have to ask for everything to be served… like, bread one slice at a time. One type of cereal, yoghurt and coffee. Great to have something available for the kids though!
- the hotel immediately beside it also looked lovely - the Dive something? It’s under construction but it looked nearly completed.
- We spent a bunch of time in the pool and ocean, walking around getting iced cream, booking our snorkel tour (they wanted a deposit in person). 

_Friday: Caye Caulker (snorkel tour with Carlos Tours)._

- there is a lot online about this tour. It’s a ridiculously beautiful catamaran to spend a day lounging on. Carlos is a great guy. He listened to our chatty 7yo talking nonstop half the day, even pulled out a pirate hat at one point. I could gush about how great this tour was - but I will refrain. Just… do it. 

- they do have kids sized snorkels and flippers, but lifejackets are sparse. My kids swim pretty well (note that you’re also more buoyant in the salty water) but still opted for a floatie thing around the middle. If your kid doesn’t swim well or at all I’d recommend you bring your own life jacket. 

- lots of sunscreen. Bring cash to settle up the bar tab (if you choose to run one; they do serve rum punch though!) at the end of the day. Your belongings are very secure while you snorkel. 

_Saturday: Ferry to Belize City, ✈️ back home_

- taxi from Ferry to Airport should be $30 USD for 1-2 people and $5 more for every extra person; we paid in cash

- arrive 3 hrs before your flight. It took an hour just to drop our bag. Note that they do not accept digital boarding passes at this airport so you either have to wait for them or print them yourself in advance. 

- there are some cute little shops beside the gate seats to spend your last Belizean dollars before going home

1osv4xr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osv4xr,Psych Scene Analysis: Lied and Lied and Lied,"The two scenes that I think are key to understanding Minho as a character are in Season 1, Episode 9. The first scene is Minho finding out that Yuri and Dae were in a fake relationship, and the second one is when Minho goes on a coffee run with Dae. I am looking at these scenes from a psychological viewpoint because there is a lot to unpack.

This is the first scene where I felt like Minho, the full-fledged character, was ready to play. Episodes 1–3, he was purposefully one-dimensional and used mainly as comic relief to foil Kitty’s smooth transition into KISS. Episodes 4–5, we get to see his sadness and that there is more to him than we originally thought. Episodes 6–8, he is growing on his own, and many of his scenes are used as contrast shots with both Dae and Yuri. Episode 9 introduced Minho as a character with complex emotions, values, virtues, and one who authentically wrestles with them. So let us break down the scene and what we can learn about Minho’s psychology in these scenes.

**Scene 1: Minho Finds Out Kitty is Right** 

**Minho:** What is happening? 

**Yuri:**  I moved in. 

**Minho:**  What? Why? Are you a throuple now?

**Yuri/Dae/Kitty:**  No 

**Yuri:** I’m gay. I came out to my mom. I moved out of the penthouse. Scared. Excited. 

**Minho:** Wait, you’ve been gay this whole time? 

**Yuri:** It’s not a choice. 

**Minho:** I know. I mean…So you and Dae you were in a fake relationship? Kitty was right? 

**Kitty:** I told you that I know matchmaking. 

**Minho:** You’re not mad at Dae? He lied and lied and lied. 

**KItty:** I was mad, but then I forgave him. 

**Minho:** Wow. You’re as trusting as my dad’s third wife. 

**Dae:** Hey, Kitty and I are good. Leave it alone. 

**Minho:** I’m not good. You lied to me too, a lot. I wouldn’t do that to a friend or someone I care about. I just wouldn’t. 

**Kitty:** Damn, never seen that side of Minho before.  

This scene lays out the anger that Minho expresses and the words that he has chosen—that honesty, loyalty, and dependability are all incredibly important to him. This moment has lots of elements to it. These are the things that I think are running through Minho’s mind as he realizes Kitty was right and that Dae had lied:

1. Minho has stated before that truth is important to him. His family—most likely his father—has probably lied countless times or wanted PR stories that were not the truth. Dae, his friend, lying does not sit well with him. Especially since he lied to someone he loved (Kitty) and also lied to him as well. Coming from his family background and his self-preservation tendencies, this upset him.

2. Minho acted hostile toward Kitty (whom he now has affection for) because he was under the belief that Dae had chosen Yuri. He probably has some guilt and regret that he went in so hard against her because he believed his friend. 

3. Minho now cares about Kitty and has feelings for her. He is upset on her behalf that Dae would put her through feeling crazy and is upset that Dae could do it so easily. He’s worried that Kitty forgiving Dae might lead to more heartache.

All of these thoughts flesh out Minho’s inner world. He is willing to speak even if it makes people uncomfortable when he thinks something is wrong. This is what Kitty clocks, and she seems to admire him for it. He speaks to both Kitty’s hurt and his own. But humans are complex, and there is an undercurrent of a secret that Minho is carrying that is also driving his anger, which he alludes to nonverbally but never states out loud. Then, of course, we cannot ignore the fact that trauma does play a role in his reaction. Deceit and forgiving people who constantly disappoint is a theme in Minho’s world, and he is projecting that onto Kitty in this scene. This is NOT a bad thing, but it is definitely a truth that we must acknowledge.

Minho in this scene shows integrity because he stands up for what he believes in, even if it causes people to feel uncomfortable. He shows that honesty, loyalty, and dependability are values dear to him, and he gets upset when he feels the people he cares about fall short in those categories. He shows a protectiveness toward Kitty that clues people into how deeply he cares, but he tries to keep the conversation in the realm of values rather than his feelings.  

**Scene 2: Coffee Run with Dae**

**Dae:** Why’d you come if you are going to be like this? 

**Minho:** Like what? I’m mad at you right now.
 
**Dae:** Listen, I’m sorry I lied to you, but this has nothing to do with you.  

**Minho:** I just mean, how could you do that to Kitty? 

**Dae:** Why are you so concerned about Kitty? 
 
*Looks deeply conflicted as he looks away tilting his head back and forward as if he is weighing his next move.* 

This scene shows you a few different things about Minho. The first is that despite being mad, he still wants to be close to Dae. He is—and has shown this in multiple ways—someone who puts people over fights. Someone else could have volunteered, but instead Minho did. Again, showing that dependability and loyalty are important values he holds dear. He wants to fix things even when he has hard feelings.

The second thing it shows is that, again, voicing his values to Dae is more important than keeping himself from an awkward conversation. Him harping on about Kitty does force Dae to ask him questions, and to be honest, it would make anyone ask questions. Minho, as far as Dae knows, has a forced friendship with Kitty—not one that calls for this kind of response. It was smarter for him to continue to frame it about his own feelings of being lied to, but instead, he chose to elevate Kitty’s treatment. 
You can also tell he is having a hard time understanding why Dae would do this to someone he loves. He is stuck on it.

Now, the last part of it will get Minho some judgment, but to me, it makes me love him more. Because I have mentioned before—having values does not mean you are perfect at them. We all make mistakes. It is how we deal with it and how we wrestle with it that shows us who we are. Dae calls Minho out on his care for Kitty. He takes a moment as he sighs, and you can tell he is having an internal debate about what he wants to say. Then he is interrupted and takes the out. He is keeping a secret from Dae, and that secret is that he is falling in love with Katherine Song-Covey. It is his love that is amplifying his protectiveness and his anger toward Dae. Keeping secrets violates the value of honesty, but ultimately, the fear of losing Dae and the desire to protect his pride keep that secret deeply hidden within him. 

I do think, so far, that Minho is someone who has integrity. He speaks with actions more than he does with words. Mistakes are learning opportunities for those with integrity. Minho, in this scene, was not ready to confront his feelings for Kitty with Dae, so he chose to bury them. Speaking truth to friends, even if it creates tension, though, is the definition of integrity. That is why these scenes are complex and when Minho became more layered. He is a man of full integrity as long as he can conquer his pride, because it is his pride that is hiding the other parts of himself—the part that tells Dae that his behavior reminded him of his father and that he is hurt that he could play games with someone he loves; the part that tells Dae that he has fallen for Kitty and that hurting her made him hurt too; the part that tells Kitty that he really does not think that she is like his dad’s third wife, but that he is worried because, in his life, people continue to disappoint you unless you hold them accountable.

But then… he was shoved against a wall…not going to get into that in this post :).

**This Scene is Rich**
This scene shows the values that Minho holds dear—honesty, loyalty, and dependability. It showcases his biggest character strengths: his integrity, his willingness to be kind in conflict, and his protective stance toward his friend. It also pulls the curtains open on his struggles: his pride, fear of rejection, and shield of speaking in virtues rather than feelings.

1osv2h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1osv2h3/coffee_anxiety/,Coffee anxiety,"So like the title says, I’m currently dealing with some lingering anxiety after I had a really really strong cup of coffee. For added context, I’m a 19yr female in college and I’ve had pretty bad general anxiety for about 5/6 yrs. Thanks to this I generally avoid doing any kind of drugs, drinking, and consuming caffeine bc ik that it tends to make my anxiety 100x worse. However last Friday night I decided to drink way more than I should’ve and so when I woke up Saturday I wasn’t feeling too hot but eventually by the afternoon (and after a decent nap) I felt good enough to feel normal. My brother’s gf had come over to our place while I was napping and me and her decided to clean my room and get rid of some chores. Bc of this I thought of having some coffee so I’d have the energy to do all we needed to do. BIG MISTAKE bc 1. I made a Cuban style coffee which iykyk but it’s STRONG ASFFF and 2. I had it on a basically empty stomach💔. But at first I felt fine so it was okay! A few hours past and then after showering I felt a bit off and suddenly boom I’m having this terrible anxiety that I cannot seem to shake off. Then to make matters worse my brothers gf has to go back to her place so now I’m alone and still anxious asf. Now it’s been over 12hrs since I had the coffee Saturday afternoon/night and I am still so anxious I could barely sleep more than a few hours and it’s so hard bc I truly have been doing amazing recently with not having any anxiety attacks and this is a massive bummer. I know I’ll start feeling better soon and hell I already feel a lot better than I did a few hours ago but it’s annoying bc I just want all this to go away now. Also I feel it’s important to include that the past few times I’ve had a STRONG cup of coffee I’ve had similar anxiety and same with the last time I tried weed over a few years ago and I had a similar sorta lingering anxiety for a few days after. Which is another reason why I cut those two things out of my life.

But this one specifically I couldn’t forget, so I recreated it on my laptop based on my memory, I’ll leave you the vocaroo so hopefully someone recognises it.

Genre-wise I would say it’s just  house music but not that fast (around 110 bpm) and with real instruments, like a real bass and real acoustic drums (or at least they’re made to sound like that). It felt kind of what people would say hipsters listen to, if that makes sense lol, like just something you would hear at a bar or a coffee shop or like something a dj would play at the beach, just that chill vibes.

So here is the vocaroo of what I made in FL studio: https://voca.ro/1bATcSf5J0QO

I’m pretty sure the melody is accurate, mine just sounds amateur, imagine that but just better-sounding (with better acoustic-sounding instruments) and just how it would sound if it was a song made profesionally, so I hope someone recognises it or any song that sounds similar (since it was a whole playlist of songs like that) thanks!!",1,1762723022.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

I had surgery on 11/6 to remove a mortons neuroma in my left foot. I was prescribed Hydrocodone 10-325, hydroxyzine 25 mg to help with itching from opioids, zofran and iburpofen 600. The hydrocodone and ibuprofen are to be taken every 6 hours but offset (hyrocodone at 6 am, ibuprofen at 9 am, hydro at 12 Pm etc.) 

After 24 hours the itching was really bad, was getting a headache and urinary retention (although this could have been from the scopolamine patch and it has since resolved) so they switched me to tramadol. Last night was horrible and I had the worst headache I've ever had. I stopped the opioids yesterday at around noon and have been trying to alternate between just Tylenol and ibuprofen. The headache has eased some but it still moderate with some nausea and the foot pain management isn't great. 

I have been drinking about 50oz-60 oz of water/ liquid IV daily, plus about 2 cups of coffee and some oatmilk/ chai tea so I don't think it's a dehydration issue. 

I also take cytomel 10 mcg and tirosint 200 mcg for thyroid, nortriptyline 10 mg for neuropathy, hydroxychloroqine 300 for sjogrens, as well as magnesium citrate 500mg, and fish oil daily. I also have rizatriptan for migraines as needed. 

The clinic is closed today but trying to figure out what to do/ take to ease the headache and manage the pain from surgery.

A month ago I decided to try something ridiculous. I picked the single most annoying task I’d been avoiding for months. Lowkey it sucked and it was agonizing and I hated it and every time I opened my laptop I wanted to slam it shut and throw it out the window. But then I made a rule: one hour, first thing every morning, no distractions, no excuses. Just that hour.

The first few mornings felt like my brain was melting. I’d pace, groan, sip terrible coffee, and still stare at the screen. On most of the days, I felt like I should just stop. But then something insane happened: my brain started craving the chaos. That hour became like a warm-up ritual for my neurons. By the end of the week, not only was the task done, but the rest of my day felt like autopilot. Emails? Easy. Meetings? Boring but fine. Small tasks? Barely registered. What also helped with consistency was a tool that forced me to stay accountable. I left it in my profile for anyone interested.
Once I got done with everything and finally had a chance to think for myself, I was staring at my phone, thinking about the mountain of things I’d actually finished, and it hit me: one tiny, terrifying hour can hijack your brain and make productivity feel like magic.

I like thinking about sustainability/energy conservation - Wind turbines, EVs, Motor/generators etc. Also wouldn't mind having an RV living project in the future.

A little about me:

I'm 5'6, about 135lbs, skinny yet muscular. Short brown hair, brown eyes, scruffy beard of varying lengths. Jeans and a t-shirt kind of guy, and I think I'm pretty cute.. pic4pic

I don't really drink aside from a few social beers now and then, 420 is okay, but no cigarettes.. I have a stable job, car, and I can host.. I prefer classic rock music than any music on the radio today, I have a cat, I like coffee, I play guitar, drums, and ukulele, I work on my own car, I'm pretty progressive, and non-religious.

Some stuff I look for in a potential partner:

I like shorter girls with an alternative/tomboy vibe, not looking for Barbie here.. Someone with liberal views, monogamous, wants a family. Preferably has or are working towards a degree (not a deal breaker), maybe engineering, CS, or some other STEM major. Preferably ambitious, independent, or entrepreneurial.

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.

Tools are your best friend. I stay consistent with all of my habits using tools. I left the most life-changing one on my profile for anyone interested.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

I've been married to my husband for six years. We have three kids under five. Twin boys who are four and a daughter who just turned two. My husband works long hours at a law firm and I'm a stay-at-home mom. His mother has always had opinions about everything I do.

She lives two hours away but visits every few months. Each time she shows up it's like I'm being audited. She checks the fridge and comments on what I'm feeding the kids. She runs her finger along surfaces looking for dust. She tells me the boys need more discipline and our daughter is too clingy because I hold her too much.

But this last visit was different.

My husband had a big case coming up. He was working until midnight most nights. His mom showed up unannounced on a Tuesday afternoon. I opened the door with our daughter on my hip and paint in my hair because the twins had decided to ""decorate"" the bathroom wall.

She walked in and looked around like she'd entered a crime scene.

""Good lord. What happened here?""

""The boys found the paint,"" I said. ""I'm cleaning it up.""

She set her bags down. ""Where's my son?""

""At work. He's been there since six this morning.""

She made this face. Like she'd just confirmed something she suspected. ""Of course he is. Working himself to death while you can't even keep the house in order.""

I was too tired to argue. ""Do you want coffee or something?""

""I want to know why my son looks so exhausted every time I see him.""

I started scrubbing paint off our daughter's hands at the kitchen sink. ""Because he's working on a major case. It'll be over in two weeks.""

""He shouldn't have to come home to this chaos. He needs a clean, peaceful home.""

""The kids are four and two. This is what it looks like.""

She followed me to the bathroom where the twins had created their masterpiece. Blue and red handprints covered one entire wall. ""This is unacceptable. You're home all day. How does this happen?""

""Because I was changing a diaper and they're fast.""

""You need systems. Structure. I raised three boys and my house never looked like this.""

I turned to face her. ""Good for you. Want a medal?""

Her face went red. ""Don't get smart with me. I'm trying to help.""

""I didn't ask for help.""

She crossed her arms. ""Maybe that's the problem. You're too proud to admit you can't handle this. My son needs a wife, not a babysitter who can barely manage the basics.""

I put down the sponge. ""What did you just say?""

""You heard me. You're acting like a babysitter. Someone who just keeps the kids alive until the parent gets home. A real wife would have dinner ready, a clean house, happy children. Not this disaster.""

Something in me just snapped.

I'd been up since five that morning. I'd refereed four fights, changed eight diapers, made three meals, done two loads of laundry, and cleaned up juice, cereal, and yogurt from various surfaces. My back hurt. My head hurt. I couldn't remember the last time I'd finished a hot cup of coffee.

And this woman was standing in my house calling me a babysitter.

""Okay,"" I said. ""You know what? You're right.""

She looked surprised. ""I am?""

""Yeah. I'm clearly not doing a good enough job. So why don't you show me how it's done?""

""I'm not sure what you mean.""

""I mean you take over. For a week. You handle everything like you think it should be handled. The kids, the house, the meals, all of it. Prove to me and your son that I'm just a useless babysitter.""

She actually smiled. ""If that's what it takes to make you see reason.""

""Great. I'm leaving tonight.""

Her smile faded a bit. ""Tonight?""

""You said you can do better. So do it. I'm going to my sister's place upstate. I'll be back next Tuesday. You can call me if there's an actual emergency. Otherwise, the house is yours.""

I went upstairs and packed a bag. My hands were shaking but I felt weirdly calm. I could hear her downstairs trying to wrangle the kids and already her voice sounded stressed.

My husband called at seven.

""Mom says you're leaving?""

""I am. She thinks I'm incompetent. So she's going to run things for a week.""

""Babe, she didn't mean it like that.""

""She called me a babysitter. In my own house. So now she gets to see what the job actually involves.""

""This is crazy. Just come back and we'll talk about this.""

""No. I've been doing this alone for months while you work on this case. I'm tired. And I'm not going to be insulted in my own home. Your mom thinks she can do better? Great. Let her prove it.""

I hung up. Then I turned off my phone.

My sister picked me up an hour later. I cried the whole drive. Not because I was sad. Because I was so angry I could barely see straight.

The first day I slept until ten. I took a bath that lasted an hour. I read half a book. I forgot what silence sounded like.

My sister kept checking her phone. ""Your husband's been calling me.""

""Tell him I'm fine.""

""He says his mom is struggling.""

""It's been one day.""

""He wants you to come back.""

""Not yet.""

Day two my sister made me breakfast. Actual breakfast that I ate while it was hot. We went for a walk. No stroller. No snacks. No stopping every five seconds because someone needed something.

My sister's phone rang at two in the afternoon.

""It's your husband again.""

I took the phone. ""What?""

""You need to come home."" His voice sounded ragged.

""No I don't.""

""My mom is losing it. The twins won't listen to her. Our daughter has been crying for six hours straight. The house is a disaster. She hasn't slept. She's completely overwhelmed.""

""Sounds like she's babysitting.""

""This isn't funny.""

""I'm not joking. She said I was incompetent. She said any real wife could handle this easily. So what's her excuse?""

""She's 63 years old. This is too much for her.""

""But it's not too much for me? I'm supposed to do this every day while she criticizes everything and you work until midnight?""

He was quiet for a second. ""She wants to apologize.""

""Great. She can apologize when I get home. On Tuesday. Like I said.""

""She's crying. She says she didn't realize how hard this was.""

""Then she shouldn't have called me a babysitter.""

I hung up again.

That night my brother-in-law made dinner. We watched a movie. I fell asleep at nine and didn't wake up until eight the next morning. No one needed me. No one was crying. It felt like a different universe.

My sister showed me a text from my husband the next morning. His mom had called him at work sobbing. She'd left the house at noon, driven two hours home, and refused to come back. She told him she couldn't do it. That she was sorry. That she'd been wrong.

My husband asked if I was ready to come home.

I stayed the full week anyway.

When I finally drove back on Tuesday afternoon the house looked like a tornado had hit it. My husband was sitting on the couch with all three kids asleep on him. He looked like he'd aged five years.

""Hey,"" he said quietly.

""Hey.""

""I took the rest of the week off work.""

""Okay.""

""My mom called. She wants to apologize to you directly.""

""I'm sure she does.""

He shifted carefully so he wouldn't wake the kids. ""I'm sorry. I didn't realize how much you were doing. And I didn't stand up for you when she said that stuff. I should have kicked her out right then.""

I sat down in the chair across from him. ""Yeah. You should have.""

""I know.""

""I'm not a babysitter. I'm their mom. And I'm your wife. And I deserve respect in my own house.""

""You're right.""

""And your mother doesn't get to visit unless she can keep her mouth shut.""

""Agreed.""

""And you need to be home more. I don't care about the case. I need help.""

""I know. I'm sorry.""

We sat there for a while. The house was quiet except for the kids breathing.

""She really only lasted 36 hours?"" I asked.

""Yeah. She called me at work crying so hard I thought someone died. She said our daughter screamed every time she put her down. The twins destroyed the living room and she couldn't get them to stop. She tried to make dinner and burned the chicken. She said she didn't remember it being this hard.""

""That's because when she did it, your dad was actually around to help.""

He nodded. ""She admitted that. She said your generation has it harder because both parents work longer hours and there's less support. She said she never could have done what you do.""

I felt something loosen in my chest. Not forgiveness exactly. But acknowledgment.

""So what now?"" he asked.

""Now you help me clean this disaster. And then we're ordering pizza. And then we're going to figure out a better schedule so I'm not drowning every day.""

""Deal.""

My mother-in-law sent flowers the next day with a card that said ""I'm sorry. You're an amazing mother."" She hasn't criticized my housekeeping since.

But here's the thing. Part of me feels guilty. She's an older woman and I basically set her up to fail. My husband says I proved a point and she needed to learn that lesson. My sister says it was justified after what she said. But some of my friends think I was too harsh and could have just talked it out instead of leaving.

So honestly, was I wrong for walking out and making her handle everything alone?

I (22M) was with her (21F) for almost four years. We met in our freshman year of college she was the loud, bright type who could make friends in seconds, and I was the quiet one who somehow got lucky enough to catch her attention. Our first date was cheap coffee and a long walk in the rain. I remember thinking, “This is it. This is the girl I’m gonna marry.”

The first couple of years were perfect. We laughed about everything. We stayed up all night watching dumb shows and eating instant noodles. We talked about our future moving in together, traveling, maybe even getting a dog.

But slowly, things started to change. She stopped holding my hand when we walked. She’d scroll through her phone while I talked. The “good morning” texts became “hey.” The “I love you”s started feeling like a habit instead of something real.

I tried to fix it  planned dates, wrote her letters, even asked if I’d done something wrong. She always said, “No, I’m just tired.” But it wasn’t just tired. It was distance. It was fading.

The last time we saw each other, I remember hugging her goodbye, and she didn’t hug back the same way. Her arms felt… polite. Cold. I went home with this pit in my chest, and a week later, she called and said she didn’t think she was “in love anymore.”

No big fight. No cheating. Just… love gone quiet.

I still check her socials sometimes, and she looks happy. There’s this one photo of her at the beach, smiling the way she used to smile at me but now she’s smiling at someone else.

I don’t hate her. I don’t even think I could. I just wish I’d known the exact moment she stopped loving me, so maybe I could’ve held on tighter. Or maybe… let go sooner.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **49ers vs. Rams: A Tale of Two Teams (One Has Injuries, the Other Has Confidence)**

The San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams are set for a Week 10 showdown that’s less “gridiron glory” and more “medical marvel vs. well-oiled machine.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a NFL trainer untangling a quarterback’s shoelaces mid-game.

---

### Odds & Implied Probabilities: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Mostly)

The Rams are favored by 5.5–6 points across bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **1.37–1.40** for Los Angeles and **3.0–3.25** for San Francisco. Converting that to implied probabilities:

* **Rams**: \~58–59% chance to win.
* **49ers**: \~31–33% chance to pull off another “overtime miracle.”

The total is set at **49.5 points**, with even money on Over/Under. Given both teams’ offensive firepower (the Rams rank 5th in points per game, the 49ers 8th), this feels like a bet on whether a popcorn kernel will pop during the third quarter—high stakes, but no real way to know until it’s too late.

---

### Injury Report: The 49ers’ Roster Feels Like a Jenga Tower

The 49ers are playing with one hand tied behind their back—or, more accurately, one *toe* (Brock Purdy’s injury) and a handful of questionable defenders. Key absences include:

* **Fred Warner** (linebacker): The team’s defensive brain, now watching from the sideline. Without him, the defense is like a GPS without Wi-Fi—confused and frequently lost.
* **Mykel Williams** (defensive end): His departure leaves the pass rush as effective as a screen door in a hurricane.
* **Ricky Pearsall** (WR): Out with a knee injury, making the 49ers’ offense feel like a five-star restaurant that forgot to order the salt.

On the bright side, George Kittle and Ben Bartch have returned, which is like getting your favorite coffee shop’s barista back after a three-week hiatus. But can they offset the loss of Warner and Williams? Probably not. Not unless Dee Winters’ knee decides to heal itself via TikTok magic.

I would be open for some players to join, all I ask is that people respect others chests unless told by the claim holder to they can use them. This server is more of a friendly server than a hardcore need a million traps to survive a blood moon game but creative mode is off and biome progression is on.

Details:

The theme is that nuclear winter has blocked out the sunlight so daylight hours are 4, this means blood moons last many in game hours but I have no cross play compatibility issues with this. Blood moon zombies walk and are only 4 per player so it’s not a nightmare night

Zombies walk at all times aside from some trader missions that give zombies their own preferences.

Survival is pretty easy after you get in game for a bit or are a 7 days to die vet. This is a beginner level game.

A handful of house POIs have been repaired and upgraded for defensive locations ready to claim, you will notice them by the fact all the interior lights are on and the doors are steel

There are two types of POIs that spawn zombie free, both are marked “safe zone” one is the apartment complex with 4 apartments, it is marked safe in the parking lot and the other is the coffee shop with the wooden supports up front, “coffee shop” has been replaced with safe zone.

Any chest marked “community chest” is free to use, take what you need, if you don’t need some good stuff stash it away for others. Community chest/s I’m working on at 786W 1339S

Doing any quest at a location begging with “user_” is a toss up, I did not restrict any areas or destroy loot boxes/white river supply bags but the one I tried would not pass the “stay within” criteria even though I did not modify it.

The map is large and all biomes have the same amount of space with forest centered, towns and wilderness POIs set to many and mountains are off so the terrain is for the most part not very hilly.

If there is any interest in this I do have it installed on a PC I use for a server and i will keep it running all the time.

Claims are limited to 3 but they are indestructible for 30 days. Loot refresh is 5 days, chunk persistence is 3 days. Claim are is 71 in area so plenty of areas to build.

Amy says “Apology accepted.”

“So do you really think I have a cute ass?” Dan asks smugly. 

“Careful Cowboy. I don’t know how you do it, but I love what you do.” As another aftershock hits. Dan slowly strokes her hair and holds her. 

“Would you like to explain that whole tirade that included me having a cute ass?”

“Yes, you have a cute ass. I like my 15 minutes of having you to myself before the rest of the world barges in.”

“I understand that.”

“On top of it you had to tease me at dinner, putting on the suit coat. Then cuddle on the couch all evening and don’t even try anything.  Let’s say I was a little worked up.”

“Why didn’t you say something?”

“I was going to when you brought the coffee in.  I was standing there naked and get a kiss on the fucking forehead!” Amy says starting to get cranked up again. 

“I’m sorry, a beautiful naked woman deserves more than a kiss on the forehead.”

“Damn right.” Slowly they get off the floor of the shower floor and finish showering. “Could you possibly what till tonight for yours?”

“You don’t owe me anything Baby Girl.”

“Granny always said the key to a happy marriage is to keep his belly full and his balls empty.”

“Granny’s a wise woman. I’ll settle for a full belly this morning.”

They finish showering. Dan heads out to do chores while Amy makes them some breakfast and gets ready. 

Dan comes in, sits down and eats breakfast with very little small talk. “I’m going to go get ready. I want you to think very carefully about what’s going on in your head. I’m not upset at all, it just feels like you’re communicating something to me and  I’m not understanding the message. Let’s just talk about it on the way in to work. 

Amy sits with it for a moment. What isn’t playing with her head. The solo business trip. Having this chance at happiness and not wanting to screw it up. The thought of taking him to meet family. Explaining mom. How to keep Dan happy. Not going to settle this in one trip to work. 

They get in the Jeep and head to work. Amy doesn’t waste any time. “Do you remember when you said we all have baggage? I think it’s time to unpack some.”

Dan smiles his calm smile. “I’m hear to listen.”

First off I’m nervous about my first solo business trip for the company. What if I screw it up”

“You won’t, I have confidence in you.”

“How do you know! I could really screw this up.”

“Shit. Alright you need to give me some credit. You don’t really think I would send a newbie into a situation where you would fail? By yourself. With no backup?” Dan says starting to get fired up. 

Amy sits there trying to understand but not understanding. 

Dan continues. “ Larry who you’re going to see tomorrow is a real customer, we went to college together. He has been my guy that people cut their teeth on. He tests my people. All it costs is you taking him and his wife out to supper on my dime.”

“So training wheels.”

“More like test drive. He’s able to see things I’m to close to see.  He really raked Rachel over the coals when she went to see him.”

“I didn’t know Rachel used to do my job. So what does that mean for me?”

“You’re safe Baby Girl. Rachel has done everyone’s job. Someday she will be one of the bosses. For now though she just wants the title of Mom.”

“I want that title too.” Amy whispered. “But it scares me too.”

“Let’s set time aside Saturday to have a long talk about that. Let’s talk about Larry though. You can tell him we are together just not until dinner that night. Him and his wife are great friends. Then Tim on Thursday morning is one of the best guys out there.  Runs a great company. So you got this.”

“So has anyone failed the Larry test?”

“You bet, most of them were set up to fail though. Like Rachel’s deal. Larry got her off point then told her the only reason she got the job was because of your Dad.”

“That’s kind of rough isn’t it?”

“At the time she needed it, had gotten a little to sure of herself.”

Thank you Daddy. I feel much better about this trip. There is more to unpack but I’m good.”

“Oh we have lunch today at noon with Charlie. Plus let’s try to get out by four. Possibly storms tonight. Get home early and get chores done before the rain.”

They get to work share a quick kiss then head inside. 

Amy sits down at her desk and gets to work. There was nothing to pressing since she wouldn’t get in till later on Thursday and Friday was a holiday. She made a quick list of the things she needed from her apartment and for tacos since it was Tuesday. When in email came through. It was from Dan to 5 top level managers and her. It requested everyone to be there at nine Friday for a short meeting. If anyone couldn’t make it they would have a private call later that day. Amy put in a reminder on her phone. A text message came through from Dan:

Baseball game Saturday?? Weather is supposed to be perfect. 

Amy texted back:

As long as you don’t get me worked up!

The three dots sat blinking for a long time till;

No promises. 

Amy heads down to the break room and makes the rounds. Someone mentions the lack of baked goods. She promises Monday. As she is leaving Sarah comes in and smiles at her and waves her to the hall back towards her office. 

Sarah whispers in her ear. “I don’t know what you’re having for breakfast but you are glowing. Oh wait, I do know WHO you’re having for breakfast.” She walks off leaving Amy wondering ‘is it really that obvious?’ 

XOXOXOXOXO

Dan checks emails and manager reports. Returns a few voicemails then heads to Charlie’s office. 

“Well Charlie is everything ready to go for Friday morning?”

“Pretty much the only contract left is Amy’s.”

“That’s what lunch is for today to feel that out. Haven’t said a word about it.”

“I don’t know how you are going to justify that to the other five but that’s not my problem.”

“That’s right. Do you think anyone won’t sign?”

“If they can’t see how generous this deal is, you don’t want them around anyway. The field guys who find out next week will be floored.”

“Everyone on the list deserves this. Only one is questionable.”

“Charlie that’s your opinion. She is going to pass the test with flying colors. Meet you in the lobby at noon.”

The 3 meet in the lobby at noon. Amy had met Charlie before but nothing past pleasantries. They went to a family Italian place where they could talk. The morning email was brought up almost immediately. Charlie was asking a lot of questions about Amy’s thoughts on the five and if there was anyone that they might have forgotten that would deserve special recognition. 

Amy was very blunt. Stating three of the five were great. One of the other two was young and a little to brash. The last one she flat out said he was a putz and Sarah and Linda did all his work. 

Her insight caught Charlie flat footed. Dan quietly took it all in. 

Dan finally spoke. “Well I think this insight means we need to change some numbers Charlie and maybe reward some support staff. Now you also understand why the one you questioned is included.”

Charlie nodded. “I will be bringing Sarah and Linda in for a talk this afternoon and do some investigating. We might have a change in plans for one of them.”

“What is this all about?” Amy asks as she continues to enjoy lunch. 

“We are setting up a reward system for my best employees a golden handcuffs. Tired of fighting to keep my best managers from getting poached. Time to reward them and it sounds like like Sarah and Linda also. This stays under wraps okay?”

Amy smiles, “I’m just having lunch with my boyfriend and his buddy.” Then winks at Dan. 

The rest of lunch has a much lighter tone. Amy comes away understanding why Charlie is Dan’s right hand man. 

They all get back to the office laughing and enjoying themselves. Charlie heads to his office and Dan and Amy step into hers. 

“ I hope everything that I said was okay.” Amy says as she gives her Silver Fox a little kiss.”

“There’s a reason we asked your opinion. Telling me the truth is all I want. You earned your keep today.”

Amy smiled. “I’m going to my apartment to pick up some things and grab stuff for taco Tuesday for supper.” She goes in for another kiss. “Unless you want to go play hooky with me this afternoon.” Laying her hand on his chest. 

“I have plans for you later today. I need to save my strength. 

“I’m going to hold you to that.”

“I have a question though. Do you have any of those cute golf skirts that you could wear Saturday to the baseball game? Not going to lie they kind of do it for me.”

Amy kisses him and wraps her arms around his neck. “You have a clothes kink don’t you!  You love it when I dress in cute clothes for you.” Dan starts blushing and stammers.

“Classy and a little sexy not slutty. Lady on the street…”

“A whore in the sheets.” Kissing Daddy long and slow. Feeling him getting hard for her. She reaches down and strokes the outside of his slacks. “I sure something can be arranged.” She kneals down and removes his cock and slowly licks the length and gives the tip a kiss slowly slides it down her throat. As she strokes him slowly Dan moans. She then puts him away. Leaving Daddy with blue balls. She stands up and kisses Dan. “That’s for kissing my forehead this morning!”

“I am beginning to understand your frustration from this morning.” Then swallows hard. 

“I’ll be ready at four.” Grabs her purse and walks out. Leaving him more than a little worked up. 

Amy heads out to her apartment. As she drives it pops into her head ‘I’m going to pay for that tease later.’ “Well I might as well make it worth while then.” She says out loud.

At the apartment she grabs a couple of her favorite outfits. Then finds her jewelry box. Laying right on top was what she wanted. Going into the bathroom she slips in a dangling navel jewel. Not practical for every day wear but will get his attention. She then puts in her clit barbell, a vertical clit hood piercing. She was glad she never let them close up. Even when no one was in her life. 

Then to the closet to find her golf skirts. She pulls out her favorite and decided what the hell, it’s a beautiful day. Puts it on.  It’s blue a little bit longer, goes to mid thigh. Puts on a sleeveless white polo and looks in the mirror. ‘This will get him really worked up.’ Slips on white tennis shoes and grabs a suitcase full of clothes. It’s off to the grocery store. 

She pulls into the parking lot at work about 3:45. Runs in and grabs everything she needs for the business trip. Puts it in the Jeep then goes to get Dan. His door is closed but knocks and waits for the invitation to enter. Then steps in and closes the door behind her. His back is to her as she walks in. 

“I’m ready to go Daddy” very softly. 

“Just one second and I’m ready to go”as he turns around. Stopping and smiles. “It’s just not fair what you do to me.”

“Funny I say the same thing.” 

Dan grabs her waist and sets her on his desk and kisses Amy delicately. Then steps back. 

“I was going to torment you a little bit, but you look to cute. I wouldn’t be able to stop.” 

“I wouldn’t want you stop. I’m yours anytime you want.”

They head out the front door and hop in the Jeep.  Ready to leave the world behind for another day. 

The thunder heads were building in the western sky. Looked like rain was coming. 

“So this change in outfits, I hope it was for my benefit.” Dan says. 

“It’s spring! Can’t a girl wear a cute outfit, just to tease a dirty old man.” 

Dan just grabs and holds Amy’s hand.

They get home and take the suitcase and groceries inside. They hurry up and change clothes then head out to take care of the animals. The thunderheads were rumbling in the west. It took a little longer than usually to get everything buttoned up before the rain. They ended up in the shop where Dan worked on the Jeeps. 

“You can take the new Jeep and ride in style tomorrow.” Dan said. So he started it and showed Amy the navigation and other features. The rain started to beat down on the roof causing a roar. “Looks like it’s hang out in here for a while or get soaked.”

“You have never shown me the collection before.” Amy said. So for the next half hour, Dan talked about his hobby of collecting and restoring Jeeps. The fun was in Dan’s pride and enthusiasm in what he had done.  The last one was Amy’s Jeep, that she had driven out there a few days ago and never left. 

“This one was a two for one special.” Dan said. “Got the Jeep and a girl came with it!” Teasing Amy. 

“The girl is the expensive part of that deal!” As she grabbed around his neck and pulled him down to her. They kissed slowly and softly as the rain pounded on the roof. There was no rushing they had all evening. 

“Would you be up to trying something that is a little kinky but it’s one thing an old man has to modify?” Dan asks. “You have my word, if you don’t like it, no harm no foul.” 

“What is it?”

Dan disappeared into the small office in the corner. He reappeared a pair of leather wrist cuffs with a foot long chain between the cuffs. He gently puts them on her wrists. They were lined and very comfortable. He leads her over to his electric hoist. It is attached the ceiling and a cable with a hook hangs down. He hooks the cuffs to the hoist and slowly raises her hands till she is standing on her tip toes. Almost suspended. 

Dan walks up and kisses her. “Are you okay? Eventually you will have your legs resting on my shoulders as I stand there. Eating that beautiful kitty.” 

How do you turn something down when he says he will keep you safe and give you pleasure. “ Let’s try it.” Amy whispers. 

He slowly lifts her till her feet are  eighteen inches off the ground and her breasts are face height to Dan. Slowly he lifts her tee shirt and undoes her bra. Lifting them up to reveal her pierced nipples. She is at the perfect height for him to devour her. She wraps her legs around his waist and pulls him in tight. He lowers the cable so she is holding herself upright on him no pull on her arms but she can’t touch him! He is sucking on her, moaning his name but is denied pulling his bald head into her breasts. Frustrated and pleasured at the same time. The pleasure soon wins out as she orgasms while he is enjoying her breasts. 

She then feels herself being pulled up as he kisses his way down her stomach. The upward movement stops. 

“Well this is new!” Dan says as he backs away to admire the navel piercing. 

Amy had forgotten about putting in the dangling jewel. She felt exposed yet desired at that moment. He slowly kissed her belly making her moan it wasn’t how she expected him to find it but this was much more erotic. Being completely at his mercy hanging in mid air. He slipped off her shorts and runs his hand down to her mound, while kissing her navel. As he reaches the clit he stops and backs away. 

“Well aren’t you full of surprises today!”

“ Yes Daddy, I put them in for you.”

“You never told me about these Baby Girl.”

“Yesterday you said my piercings turned you on and I might have to get more.” He slowly starts kissing the barbell and she could feel herself getting even wetter. Slowly she is raised up. 

Daddy positions her legs over her shoulders and starts to lick her slit. Gently at first then becoming more aggressive.  Slowly he lowers her so her weight is on his shoulders but she still can’t touch him. The frustration of not being able to touch him yet so much pleasure from his mouth. She can feel the pressure start to build in her core. His moans letting her know he loves what he’s doing to her kitty. 

“Just like that Daddy, I’m going to cum!” She squeaks as the flood covers his face. He doesn’t stop as she grinds into his mouth. 

Slowly she is lifted up, off his face. Then slowly lowered as her body is kissed on her way down. Holding her close, she is slowly lowered onto his rock hard cock. Gasping as he enters her. Wrapping her legs around him he drives up into her repeatedly.  Slowly her arms can go around his head. He’s holding her whole weight just bouncing up and down reaching places never reached before. Touching him again with her arms and able to pull his head into her shoulder. 

“Cum for me Daddy! I need you!”

Two more pumps and Daddy starts to shake and squeeze her tight to his body and moans into her mouth as they melt together. 

Time freezes as he holds her tightly against his body. Slowly she is let the rest of the way down. He turns her around so she can lean against him as he removes the cuffs. Grabs his shirt from a nearby stool and helps her put it on. Again she hears the thunder outside and the rain on the roof. 

He carries her through the rain into the house. Carrying her into the bathroom, setting her on the counter. Starts the shower kicks off the cowboy boots and then leads her to the shower. They get in Amy still wearing Dan’s shirt and him in his jeans.

1osucdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1osucdk/1_year_old_waking_up_whining_for_months/,1 year old waking up whining for months,"To preface, I have a 2 year old and 1 year old. They share a room. Sleep set up is wall to wall floor bed (like 10+ ft of mattress width), they each have their own blankets and sleep on their own sides; sometimes cuddling. The 2 year old sleeps through the night. 1 year old never wakes up 2 year old even when he cries. 

For the last two months my 1 year old will go to bed between 8 and 9, usually wakeup once between 1 and 3. All I need to do is go in there, cover him up, make sure there’s a pacifier in reach and set my hand on him for a minute or two and he’s out. Then he’ll wake up again between 3:45 and 5. He’s always been an early riser but I can tell he is never actually ready to wake up. He will just toss and turn and whine and whine and whine and whine. No matter what I do. I’ve tried Tylenol thinking maybe he teething, a bottle thinking he’s hungry, diaper change, cuddles, no cuddles and just being there, rocking him. Nothing works. I end up just having to get him up and start the day, which is fine but then he just whines all morning because he’s tired but won’t go back to sleep until around somewhere between 9 and 11. 

It’s getting to a point where his incessant whining is just pissing me off. I want to help him but it just feels like there is no solution and idk how much more of this i can take. I’m tried, overstimulated and just want this kid to get the sleep he needs. Please give me any advice you have. I am open to doing a chant and dance at this point if it would help. Also please tell me if I need to just get over it and it’s a phase, blah blah blah, because that would at least give me hope. I honestly don’t remember what my 2 year old was doing at this age since we also had a newborn. That whole period was a blur.

1osu9pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/toRANTo/comments/1osu9pd/view_on_toronto_from_an_american/,"View on Toronto, from an American","Let me begin by saying that I know things are fucked up in America. We have a fascist Cheeto for a president and no universal healthcare. Shit is too expensive. We're now staring at a recession because a bunch of companies haven't yet realized laying off people is a bad idea when the U.S. is a consumer-based economy. Unemployed people tend to not want to buy shit, so that has consequences.

I was excited to go to Canada for the first time. I came to see a Cindy Lee concert (they were great). 

But holy hell, your city sucks. 

I should have known something was up when I overheard someone on the 505 say, ""I really want to go to Houston but the U.S. is so hyped."" Tell me you know nothing about the U.S. without saying you don't know anything about the U.S. 

I pored over Reddit threads to see which restaurants to check out. People said to hit St. Lawrence Market, so I did and decided to order the seafood orzo pasta at Buster's Sea Cove. I was treated to undercooked, rubbery calamari. I politely complained and was told, ""We prepared it this morning."" Apparently, the teenage cook thought food magically stays warm for four hours. Annoyed, I used bass in my voice, which I really don't like doing, and said it was cold. He reluctantly heated up the dish. It wasn't an improvement.

I should have listened to my inner skeptic when trying La Bella Managua. Nicaraguans tend not to live in Canada, it said, they tend to be in the States, it said. But it had a lot of good reviews. I ordered the churrasco with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Seasoning is not a thing at this joint. Steak only tastes like the suggestion of steak. I should note here my father is from Managua, so I grew up eating this food. 

There have been other places. Same middling nonsense. I see the taxes you add on to restaurant bills, and I feel doubly hosed.

Your record stores are hilarious. Considerably more expensive than the U.S., often in rough shape. I went to Cosmos, Sonic Boom, Battle, Rotate This, Pandemonium, and Lost n' Found. I managed to buy one record from Invisible City, though.  

How the fuck do you people afford to live here?! And surrounded by such uninspiring architecture (I'm from Chicago)? 

I do commend you on your racial diversity and good public transit. I'm also enjoying my lavender haze latte at Forget Me Not which actually tastes like lavender unlike the latte I had at the Distillery District. Talk about overpriced, ""artisanal"" white-people garbage. To the white lady who was carrying two coffees and said to me, ""Hold the door open for me, I can't do it"" with no please or thanks, fuck you.

For the longest time, I used to wonder why any Canadian would live in the U.S. After being here, I now understand why.

I’ll be making my first sour jar to get rid some my mother in law who is living in our home and it’s been very difficult to get her to leave. It’s excuse after excuse, and it’s been very draining. 
I’ve decided to make a sour jar for her, I’ve gotten some advice from friends and loved ones but I’d like some more input. 
I don’t want her to be harmed but I do want her out fast and to not feel welcomed in this home. 
I’ve created a few sigils, I drew one on the lid of the jar and others on paper that I’ve placed in the jar. The general theme is “MIL will leave this house very soon and permanently “ “MILs intentions and manipulative behavior will come to light”  “MIL will be forced to leave this home”.
Contents of the jar include:
Vinegar from a jar of pickled jalapeños
Pepper flakes
Cayenne pepper
Poppy seed
Her toe nail clippings 
Dirt from a dead house plant
Hot sauce 
Coffee grounds 
Old rusty razor blade
Rusty nails


I have a mug that she gave me. I heard broken glass is good to add but was wondering if having broken ceramic from an item given to me from her would be extra potent.


As far as what to do with the jar after, plan to keep it a few days or week to occasionally shake to stir up the negative effects.

1osu5vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1osu5vi/i_30m_never_got_over_my_ex_28m_after_a_couple/,"I [30m] never got over my ex [28m]. After a couple years apart he left his home state and now lives five minutes from me. We spend all of our time together, and I'm getting mixed signals. How do I talk to him about my feelings without blowing up our friendship?","Sorry for the long post, there's a lot of context I think is important but I'll try to keep it to the essentials.  I lived together with Alex (fake name) for a couple years.  This was about 7 or 8 years ago.  He lived out of state -- we had met while I was there on a business trip.  I kept going down there for business, and we ended up dating long-distance before he moved in with me to get out of his mom's house.  
  
About a year later, covid had just starting locking things down.  I had been financially supporting him the entire time.  We were both depressed for various reasons, he had cheated on me, and our lease wasn't being renewed.  I had found a place with a friend, but we didn't have room for him or his dog.  Eventually, he goes back home and lives with his mom again. 

A year or two go by, and we're talking via text or discord pretty often.  I've always been, and still am, in love with him.  I tried to be a good friend though, and I supported him through his troubles.  We both eventually get into relationships for a year or two.  We stay in touch and remain good friends, but it was always a little hard on me.  The guy he was dating was abusive to him and it was hard for me to find the right way to help.

I had never forgiven myself for essentially forcing him to move back to the home he hated with his mentally-ill mother. I feel like I just totally changed the trajectory of his life. I had put aside money from every one of my paychecks since he moved back home and put it aside for him.  I was hoping that I would have a decent amount of money saved up to help get him on his feet when he was ready to move back out, whenever and wherever that was.  Over the years I had saved just around $10k for him.  He had no idea I'd been doing this.

At this point (a year or two ago) he was frustrated with his relationship, his awful job, and living with his mother.  We're talking like normal and we end up deciding on going to to a theme park near him for a vacation.  I book the hotel, we're excited to go, and as I'm getting on the plane he lets me know that his boyfriend broke up with him.  I don't know the specifics, but I know that the fact that we were still communicating and going on a trip together was a big reason why they broke up.  I've always been honest that I care about him, but I'd been pretty good about maintaining my friendship boundaries.

  
We end up still having an excellent trip and try to put all the worries behind us.  We're laughing and talking and having a great time.  It was so effortless, we just slipped back into the same rhythm.  We both try to keep the conversation surface level and away from relationships or anything, just really focus on enjoying the moment.  I fly out after the weekend and we go back to our normal rhythm of talking.

He had been getting serious about finding a place to move.  I had given him recommendations on a bunch of cities, both in my state and in the surrounding ones.  As much as I wanted him to move back to my city, I knew it would be selfish for me to try to convince him to go somewhere.  I wanted him to move somewhere he really wanted to be and that would give him the best shot at freedom and living alone.  Long story short, after a couple months of looking, he tells me that he ended up picking the city I live in.

After another couple months, and with my helping scouting apartments, he ends up living in an apartment five minutes from my house.  He knows I was willing to help him with his moving expenses, so I end up drawing from the fund I put together for him for the first time.  I end up spending half of it helping him get moved in and settled into his apartment, and have been helping him out with some extra cash every month.

  
I'm going through a lot of emotions at this point.  I always had a little dream in the back of my mind that we would get back together one day, but that was always so far from reality I tried my best to ignore it.  I had given up on that and was trying my best to be a solid, supportive friend.  He's my best friend and we talk to each other about  pretty much everything, except us.  Suddenly he lives down the street from me, and we're cooking dinner together a couple times a week.  We see each other three or four times a week -- I walk his dog if he's busy at work or drop him off a coffee.  We work out together and go shopping together.  We text each other good morning and talk all day.  We haven't talked about our relationship at all, nor even why he picked my city to live in.

  
A couple weeks ago he mentioned wanted to go out of town to an amusement park for his birthday.  We rented a beautiful cabin in the mountains for a couple nights and have been excited for it.  But I've been getting so many mixed signals, I feel like the things we do together aren't normal for a typical friendship.  But I'm also the only friend he has here. Every time I try to start the conversation about being together or hooking up or just clearing the air I lose my nerve.  I feel like it might be worth having this conversation when we have some uninterrupted time at the cabin in a couple weeks, but I also don't want to ruin his birthday if things don't go well.  My mind just blanks when I see him and I can never get the words out.

I will always support him and whatever he wants to do, even if I'm not a part of it.  But I'm struggling a lot right now with my feelings for him.  I think he's the funniest, hottest, kindest person and want nothing more than to be with him.  But I don't want to risk having the conversation about us if I'm the only person he knows here in this city.  He's a big introvert and doesn't make friends easily.  I don't want to screw up our friendship by opening that door but I'm dying inside all the time with all the emotional and sexual tension.  I went over to his place yesterday to rip the bandaid off, but I wasn't able to go through with it.  I just need a bit of clarity, but I don't want to lose our relationship forever or ruin his life again.

I want him to make a move and let me know if he's even interested in me at all.  He tends to just shut down if we start talking about personal things, and as long as I've known him and I don't think he's ever initiated an important conversation like that before. I can't really move forward right now, this has been eating away at me for months.  I'm pretty positive he knows we need to talk about some of this stuff, I'm a lot more transparent with my feelings than I'd like to be.  How do I clear the air with us and figure out what the hell we're doing?  He's such an important part of my life, and has been for many years.  I don't want to screw this up.

  
TLDR; I never got over my ex, who is my best friend.  He moved a thousand miles to live five minutes from me, where I'm the only person he knows.  We spend all of our time together and I'm getting mixed signals.  I don't know if he wants to be more than friends again, and we haven't talked about it.  How do talk to him about hooking up again or being in a relationship again without bombing our friendship?

Ice doesn’t actually improve a drink, it just waters it down and kills the flavor. Most beverages are made to be enjoyed at a specific concentration and balance, but once the ice starts melting, you’re basically drinking a diluted version that tastes like flavored water.

Unless it’s a cocktail that’s meant to be chilled and balanced around melting ice, most drinks are better served cold from the fridge, not sitting in a puddle of melted ice. Sodas lose their sharpness, juices lose their richness, and even coffee or tea become thin and lifeless when ice gets involved.

If the goal is just to cool the drink, the fridge (or even a chilled glass) does that without ruining the taste. Ice might make it *look* refreshing, but flavor-wise, it’s often a downgrade.",45,1762720803.0,unpopularopinion,30,0.75,False

1osu2xz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osu2xz,Supper club review - Terre à Terre (Catherine Bohart),"Hi genies. The supper clubbers are back with another review.

This month, we headed out of London to the gorgeous seaside town of Brighton. As one of the UK’s greenest cities, it felt fitting that our pick was Terre à Terre which has been serving modern vegan and vegetarian cuisine since 1993.

It’s a long-time local favourite, winning Best Restaurant in Brighton & Hove last year and coming in second this year — no small feat in a city packed with great places to eat. This reco came from comedian Catherine Bohart, who likes the miso aubergine.

We opted for the lunchtime tasting menu, at a very reasonable £26.50. It’s one of those posh places where you don’t understand anything on the menu — but we’ll forgive Terre à Terre, because the waitress explained each dish in such animated detail it added a bit of much-needed panache to our quiet Sunday.

The tasting menu includes five or six dishes. Favourites for us included the Makki Ki, a crispy fried fritter with mango lime chutney and coconut yoghurt on butter-baked aubergine hummus; the Szechuan house-smoked tofu with chilli miso sauce and housemade kimchi; and the Butterbean & Smoked Harissa brandade with crackers.

You won’t roll out of here stuffed to the brim if you opt for the tasting menu, but each portion is so considered and flavourful - it’s definitely one to savour. 

It also leaves room for pudding. We finished with the Snap, Crackle Choc: dark chocolate cacao mousse, hazelnut cake, banana and a salted caramel truffle. I might not usually opt for truffles, but they went down perfectly with a post-lunch coffee.

Highly praised overall by our long term vegan and veggie guests, as well as the carnivores!

After a couple years apart he left his home state and now lives five minutes from me.  We spend all of our time together, and I'm getting mixed signals.  How do I talk to him about our dating or hooking up again without blowing up our friendship?","Sorry for the long post, there's a lot of context I think is important but I'll try to keep it to the essentials.  I lived together with Alex (fake name) for a couple years.  This was about 7 or 8 years ago.  He lived out of state -- we had met while I was there on a business trip.  I kept going down there for business, and we ended up dating long-distance before he moved in with me to get out of his mom's house.  
  
About a year later, covid had just starting locking things down.  I had been financially supporting him the entire time.  We were both depressed for various reasons, he had cheated on me, and our lease wasn't being renewed.  I had found a place with a friend, but we didn't have room for him or his dog.  Eventually, he goes back home and lives with his mom again. 

A year or two go by, and we're talking via text or discord pretty often.  I've always been, and still am, in love with him.  I tried to be a good friend though, and I supported him through his troubles.  We both eventually get into relationships for a year or two.  We stay in touch and remain good friends, but it was always a little hard on me.  The guy he was dating was abusive to him and it was hard for me to find the right way to help.

I had never forgiven myself for essentially forcing him to move back to the home he hated with his mentally-ill mother. I feel like I just totally changed the trajectory of his life. I had put aside money from every one of my paychecks since he moved back home and put it aside for him.  I was hoping that I would have a decent amount of money saved up to help get him on his feet when he was ready to move back out, whenever and wherever that was.  Over the years I had saved just around $10k for him.  He had no idea I'd been doing this.

At this point (a year or two ago) he was frustrated with his relationship, his awful job, and living with his mother.  We're talking like normal and we end up deciding on going to to a theme park near him for a vacation.  I book the hotel, we're excited to go, and as I'm getting on the plane he lets me know that his boyfriend broke up with him.  I don't know the specifics, but I know that the fact that we were still communicating and going on a trip together was a big reason why they broke up.  I've always been honest that I care about him, but I'd been pretty good about maintaining my friendship boundaries.

  
We end up still having an excellent trip and try to put all the worries behind us.  We're laughing and talking and having a great time.  It was so effortless, we just slipped back into the same rhythm.  We both try to keep the conversation surface level and away from relationships or anything, just really focus on enjoying the moment.  I fly out after the weekend and we go back to our normal rhythm of talking.

He had been getting serious about finding a place to move.  I had given him recommendations on a bunch of cities, both in my state and in the surrounding ones.  As much as I wanted him to move back to my city, I knew it would be selfish for me to try to convince him to go somewhere.  I wanted him to move somewhere he really wanted to be and that would give him the best shot at freedom and living alone.  Long story short, after a couple months of looking, he tells me that he ended up picking the city I live in.

After another couple months, and with my helping scouting apartments, he ends up living in an apartment five minutes from my house.  He knows I was willing to help him with his moving expenses, so I end up drawing from the fund I put together for him for the first time.  I end up spending half of it helping him get moved in and settled into his apartment, and have been helping him out with some extra cash every month.

  
I'm going through a lot of emotions at this point.  I always had a little dream in the back of my mind that we would get back together one day, but that was always so far from reality I tried my best to ignore it.  I had given up on that and was trying my best to be a solid, supportive friend.  He's my best friend and we talk to each other about  pretty much everything, except us.  Suddenly he lives down the street from me, and we're cooking dinner together a couple times a week.  We see each other three or four times a week -- I walk his dog if he's busy at work or drop him off a coffee.  We work out together and go shopping together.  We text each other good morning and talk all day.  We haven't talked about our relationship at all, nor even why he picked my city to live in.

  
A couple weeks ago he mentioned wanted to go out of town to an amusement park for his birthday.  We rented a beautiful cabin in the mountains for a couple nights and have been excited for it.  But I've been getting so many mixed signals, I feel like the things we do together aren't normal for a typical friendship.  But I'm also the only friend he has here. Every time I try to start the conversation about being together or hooking up or just clearing the air I lose my nerve.  I feel like it might be worth having this conversation when we have some uninterrupted time at the cabin in a couple weeks, but I also don't want to ruin his birthday if things don't go well.  My mind just blanks when I see him and I can never get the words out.

I will always support him and whatever he wants to do, even if I'm not a part of it.  But I'm struggling a lot right now with my feelings for him.  I think he's the funniest, hottest, kindest person and want nothing more than to be with him.  But I don't want to risk having the conversation about us if I'm the only person he knows here in this city.  He's a big introvert and doesn't make friends easily.  I don't want to screw up our friendship by opening that door but I'm dying inside all the time with all the emotional and sexual tension.  I went over to his place yesterday to rip the bandaid off, but I wasn't able to go through with it.  I just need a bit of clarity, but I don't want to lose our relationship forever or ruin his life again.

How should I go about having the conversation with him?  I want him to make a move and let me know if he's even interested in me at all.  He tends to just shut down if we start talking about personal things, and as long as I've known him and I don't think he's ever initiated an important conversation like that before. I can't really move forward right now, this has been eating away at me for months.  I'm pretty positive he knows we need to talk about some of this stuff, I'm a lot more transparent with my feelings than I'd like to be.  He's such an important part of my life, and has been for many years.  I don't want to screw this up.

  
TLDR; I never got over my ex, who is my best friend.  He moved a thousand miles to live five minutes from me, where I'm the only person he knows.  We spend all of our time together and I'm getting mixed signals.  I don't know if he wants to be more than friends again, and we haven't talked about it.  How do talk to him about hooking up again or being in a relationship without bombing our friendship?

1ostwb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1ostwb8/plumbing_question_for_hot_water_to_bathroom/,Plumbing question for hot water to bathroom.,"My water heater is like 20 years old and is on its last legs. I am trying to save for a new one but don’t have a ton of money to set aside after all of my other expenses. Until I am able to purchase a new water heater for my house I have a question about things I can do to improve that hot water in the mean time.

My wife always complains that the water coming out of the faucet into our tub is too cold! The instant read thermometer I use for cooking says it’s coming out at 116.4*F personally when I shower I have zero complaints. Feels hot and steamy to me. It’s gotten to a point where she’s been asking me to boil several pots of water to pour into the tub to help warm up the water to a comfortable temperature for her.

I noticed in the Michigan Winters our basement gets quite cold. Would it make sense to to insulate the galvanized pipes that run from the water heater to the bathroom to keep it from losing heat? There’s probably like 10’ to 15’ of 1/2” or 3/4” galvanized pipe between the bathroom in the water heater. Or does water move through the pipe so quickly that this would not make a difference? I was thinking about using those pool noodle things to cover the pipe.

I have tried to take off the handle off the faucet and adjust the mixer but that doesn’t seem to make much of a difference. 

I thought about warming up the tub with a pot of hot water before filling it up. Sort of like how one might pour hot water into a mug to warm it up before putting there hot coffee in there.

I’ve been building this project for a while and finally decided to make it public. It’s completely free to use, no paywall or subscription — just something I wanted to share with the community.

\-----------------------------------

The main features in this software are taken from the research results of: perplexity, chat gpt, and gemini,...

My idea is to help new users of suno easier in making music when they sometimes have the wrong rhythm, sometimes the wrong instrument. The features of the starter mode are almost default as suggested. In the studio mode, you can choose a variety of instruments, rhythms, and tempos.

I am not a master of music production, so I hope the **COMMUNITY DEVELOPS THE APP WITH ME by sending me some comments to upgrade in the next version.**

\-------------------------------------

**TO GET THE APP,** [FIND ME HERE](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1IAOfqwYQxFpj7Si0n5GE079GJNB4ujus)

**To use the app, you must have a google account.**

\-------------------------------------

# ✨ Main Features

* **Auto Prompt:** Uses AI to automatically generate prompts based on the context or style you need. 🤖
* **Auto Lyric:** Allows the app to automatically generate lyrics based on a specific scenario or context. ✍️

# 🚀 2 Basic Modes

1. **Starter Mode:** Great for getting going! You pick the **Music Genre**, and it provides suggestions for **tempo, rhythm**, and more.
2. **Studio Mode:** Dive deeper! This mode gives you more detailed suggestions, broken down **by each instrument** (like piano, guitar, drums, etc.). 🎸🎹

If there’s one skill that can multiply your business results without increasing your ad spend, it’s copywriting. The ability to turn words into sales is what separates a thriving entrepreneur from one constantly struggling to convert attention into income. But here’s the secret — copywriting that sells isn’t about being flashy, manipulative, or overly clever. It’s about understanding people, communicating clearly, and inspiring action through simple, human language.

We don’t need to be professional writers to master it. We just need to develop the right habits — the ones that help us write in a way that attracts attention, builds trust, and moves people to buy.

Let’s explore ten copywriting habits that help entrepreneurs sell more effectively, build stronger brands, and connect deeply with their audience.

# 1)) Start With Deep Audience Understanding

Before a single word is written, the most successful entrepreneurs take the time to know their audience inside and out. This isn’t just demographics — it’s psychographics. We need to know what keeps our audience up at night, what motivates them to act, and what emotional triggers drive their decisions.

Copywriting that sells starts with empathy. The more we understand the customer’s problems, desires, and goals, the more naturally our words resonate.

Create a “voice of the customer” file. Collect real phrases from testimonials, emails, and social media comments. Study the words your customers use when they talk about their frustrations or dreams. When you write using *their* language, you instantly create trust.

The goal isn’t to sound smart — it’s to sound familiar. And familiarity is what turns readers into buyers.

# 2)) Focus on Benefits, Not Features

It’s easy to talk about what our product or service *does*, but people buy because of what it *does for them.* Entrepreneurs who master copywriting that sells know how to translate features into benefits — and benefits into emotions.

For example, if you sell a marketing app:

* **Feature:** “Includes automated posting.”
* **Benefit:** “Saves you hours every week.”
* **Emotional payoff:** “Gives you more time to focus on what actually grows your business.”

We must move beyond technical details and focus on transformation. What changes after someone buys from us? What new feeling or freedom do they experience? The more clearly we connect our offer to an emotional benefit, the more persuasive our copy becomes.

# 3)) Write Like You Talk

Entrepreneurs often get caught up trying to sound “professional,” but the truth is, conversational writing sells far better than formal writing ever will. Our audience wants authenticity, not jargon.

Imagine sitting across from your ideal customer at a coffee shop. How would you explain your product? That’s the tone you want to write in.

Use contractions (“you’re” instead of “you are”). Keep sentences short. Use everyday language. Avoid corporate clichés like “innovative solutions” or “leveraging synergies.” The best copy sounds like a conversation, not a presentation.

When readers feel like they’re talking to a real person, not a brand, they’re far more likely to trust what’s being said.

# 4)) Lead With Emotion, Support With Logic

People buy on emotion and justify with logic. It’s one of the oldest truths in marketing — and it’s never been more relevant.

As entrepreneurs, we need to tap into the emotional core of our audience before we present the rational details. If our message doesn’t make someone *feel* something first — curiosity, excitement, relief, or even fear of missing out — the logical benefits won’t land.

Lead with emotion through storytelling, relatable pain points, or vivid imagery. Once you’ve captured attention emotionally, *then* introduce logical proof — testimonials, features, guarantees, or data.

This combination of heart and head creates copywriting that sells naturally because it speaks to the whole human, not just the intellect.

# 5)) Use Proven Copywriting Frameworks

Great entrepreneurs don’t reinvent the wheel every time they write. They rely on frameworks — structured approaches that make persuasive writing easier and faster.

Some of the most effective ones include:

* **AIDA** – Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.
* **PAS** – Problem, Agitate, Solution.
* **FAB** – Features, Advantages, Benefits.
* **Before–After–Bridge** – Show life before your product, life after, and bridge the gap with your solution.

Frameworks keep your message clear and emotionally compelling. They also prevent your copy from rambling. Each piece of content should have a specific goal — to make the reader take one clear action.

When we follow proven structures, we spend less time guessing and more time selling.

# 6)) Tell Stories That Sell

Humans are wired for stories. We remember stories far longer than facts, and we emotionally connect with characters more than statistics. Entrepreneurs who tell stories sell more because they give meaning to their message.

Think of your copy as a story about transformation — the customer’s journey from frustration to success. The product or service is the bridge that gets them there.

Here’s a simple way to structure it:

* **Before:** What was life like before the solution?
* **After:** What does life look like now?
* **Bridge:** How did the product or service make that transformation possible?

Storytelling isn’t just for long-form copy. Even short product descriptions or emails can tell micro-stories that humanize your brand. The more your audience sees themselves in the story, the easier it is for them to say “yes.”

# 7)) Edit Ruthlessly and Respect Attention

Great copy isn’t written — it’s rewritten. Entrepreneurs who want to sell effectively must learn to edit like a pro.

We live in an attention-starved world. Every word must earn its place. That means cutting fluff, avoiding filler, and removing anything that doesn’t serve the reader’s goal.

Here’s a quick rule: after writing your first draft, cut 30% of it. Then read it out loud. If something sounds awkward or drags, fix it. Tight, punchy sentences keep momentum.

Clear beats clever every time. And clarity is the foundation of copywriting that sells.

# 8)) Always Include a Strong Call to Action

It’s surprising how many entrepreneurs forget to *ask* for the sale. Every piece of copy — whether an email, ad, or product page — should tell the reader exactly what to do next.

Your call-to-action (CTA) should be specific, direct, and emotionally charged. Instead of “Learn more,” say “Start your free trial today.” Instead of “Sign up,” say “Join hundreds of entrepreneurs who are already growing faster.”

A strong CTA bridges the gap between interest and action. It gives readers permission and motivation to take the next step. Without it, even great copy loses its selling power.

# 9)) Test, Track, and Tweak Constantly

Copywriting is part art, part science. Entrepreneurs who master it know that what works once might not work forever. That’s why testing is essential.

Test your headlines, your CTAs, your lead paragraphs. Track what resonates most — which emails get clicks, which pages convert best, which hooks grab the most attention.

Use the data to refine your voice and message. Over time, you’ll build a collection of “winning” copy patterns that consistently perform well.

Think of it as ongoing market research. Every word you publish gives you insight into what your audience responds to. The more you test, the sharper your message becomes — and the more effective your selling gets.

# 10)) Practice Copywriting Every Day

Like any skill, copywriting improves through consistent practice. The most successful entrepreneurs don’t just write when they need to — they write daily, even in small doses.

Set aside time to write headlines, emails, or product descriptions. Rework ads from your industry to see how you’d improve them. Keep a swipe file of great examples that inspire you.

Copywriting is a habit, not a one-time task. The more you write, the more natural persuasion becomes. You start to “hear” what your audience wants — and how to say it in a way that connects.

When writing becomes second nature, selling follows naturally.

# Conclusion

Entrepreneurs often look for complex marketing systems or advanced funnels to boost sales, but the truth is simpler — success begins with words that connect, persuade, and inspire. Copywriting that sells is a skill every entrepreneur can master by adopting these habits: knowing your audience, focusing on benefits, speaking conversationally, leading with emotion, using proven frameworks, telling stories, editing ruthlessly, including calls to action, testing constantly, and practicing daily.

When we commit to improving the way we communicate, we don’t just sell more — we serve better. We transform our products into solutions, our messages into movements, and our readers into loyal customers.

Start building these copywriting habits today, and you’ll quickly see the difference in how people respond, engage, and buy. The power of words isn’t just in what they say — it’s in how they make people feel. And that’s the essence of copywriting that sells.",1,1762719387.0,u_marketingwarchest,0,1.0,False

Just for info: 
I am a 25 AFAB transmasc butch lesbian. 
I am 5”2, ~165, I work in a hotel as a manager, but walk around daily. I drink coffee- not energy drinks, I vape(trying to quit) and smoke weed with a bong or a wax pen to help with my PTSD and anxiety. I’m trying to use edibles more instead since I have intermittent asthma from birth. 
I was born premature and in the womb I actually tried to initiate labor at around 5 months, but they gave my wonderful mom medicine to keep me cooking. I came out after 24 hours of labor looking like a hot mess. I had the cord wrapped tight around my neck, jaundiced, had a collapsed lung, pnemonia, and I had sucked in amniotic fluid and was asphyxiated. Used a nebulizer and inhaler until I was 6 or so and then I was told I didn’t need it anymore. (That’s not how that works) struggled all through life with running or just walking outside when it was cold. So, now I use an Albuterol inhaler as needed and my preventative inhaler twice a day and it works very well.
Vitamins:
Magnesium 500mg, B12, Once a day women’s health(2 gummies) Vitamin C packets bi weekly, liquid IV or electrolyte drink.
Meds:
I am on Vyvanse 50mg for ADHD, Zoloft 100mg for my depression, anxiety, OCD(undiagnosed as of this post, pending psych eval), and PTSD, as well as Trazadone 50mg for insomnia and because my pain makes it hard to fall asleep. In July I switched from Cymbalta 60mg-I had been taking since 2023- to barely weaning off of it before even being given my introductory dose of Zoloft (25mg)
Anyways

The reason I’m reaching out:
I’ve been doing a curly routine for almost 7 years, but l shaved my head over the summer and since it's grown out I can't for the life of me get it untangled from my scalp. 
I've spent close to 300 hours the last 2 months and countless doctors appointments(where I got brushed off{no pun intended bc she didn’t even look through my hair}) trying to figure it out. The very end of August i realized all my chronic pain and muscle strains in my neck and back were actually coming from my scalp and virtually anywhere I grew hair. I searched into an ungodly amount of forums and researched countless potential issues and the two that actually aligned with most of the symptoms was pili multigemini. I understand that (as far as we know) it’s extremely rare on a widespread scale.
I have extremely thick hair. In each follicle, 4-5 hairs are growing out of them. If there’s no space, it grows under the skin, or over other hair. 

The end of September I finally got an eye doc to take a look at my eyes and see why my eyelashes were bothering me. He took in depth images of my eyes and was able to confirm that I have Distichiasis, but he did agree it aligned with the rarer version of pili multigemini in AFABs. My paternal grandmother had the same level of facial hair as well as tight skin from the hair trapping it in place. I live in Rural Virginia and I can barely walk since it’s affecting my toes and trying to reshape my bone placement.

My hair is very coily and lately my hair is clumping together and pulling my skin. it's super painful and the derm said it could be caused from PCOS; hisuratism. They prescribed a benzo wash and steroid lotion to treat it so | don't have folliculitis anymore but it was BAD in september. I made it through October but I barely want to be seen because I feel like I look mangey. :(((((((

I use curly products, no sulfates, condition and use shea leave in deep conditioner after using clarifying products. I can't wear bonnets to sleep anymore because I wake up and it's squished and yanking at my skull. Pleeeeeeease help. I wear glasses as well, I just want help : ( this is miserable

1ostfod,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ostfod/preground_espresso_recommendations_no_budget/,Pre-ground espresso recommendations? [no budget],"I understand that nothing pre-ground will ever compare to a fresh ground coffee, I’ve been a cafe barista for 4 years, I understand and can taste the difference, trust me.

That being said, I can’t afford a grinder at the moment, but I do have an espresso machine, a Gaggia Classic from 2011 that I recently bought at a garage sale and refurbished, and until I can save up for a grinder, I’d still like to use it.

I’ve been using Lavazza beans, but I’ve found that the crema e gusto I got off of Amazon is a bit too bitter for my liking. Any recommendations? Preferably on the cheaper side.",0,1762719178.0,espresso,5,0.33,False

On July 4th, at 10 p.m., I set off from Stamsund, cycling up a long, steep climb under a bright sun. On the descent, which lay in the shadow of the mountains, I got so cold that I stopped at a rest area, made myself a hot coffee (photo 3), and put on warmer clothes. Under the midnight sun, I continued along the road beside the fjord (photo 6). On a gently sloping hillside scattered with rocks, I found the perfect spot to set up my bivouac. With my bivouac sack and sleeping bag, I settled down comfortably on soft cushions of grass and moss and slept soundly for two hours until the sun, having risen over the mountain, woke me at 5 a.m. The landscape revealed its full beauty in the sunlight (photos 4 and 5). I arrived in Reine, with its world-famous panorama (photo 1), via the wonderful coastal road (photo 2).",50,1762719163.0,bikepacking,0,0.99,False
