I hate him and his enabling fans because he promotes shitty financial advice, bad hygiene, and bad manners. I truly cannot stand people who are like “but he’s not hurting anyone else”, which is untrue. I keep on seeing young adults say they’re taking his advice by charging their electronics at home to save like 3 cents, reducing the food they eat, and not replacing their old clothes. It’s truly a deprived way to live. 

The way he basically takes advantage of his friends who live in the city by staying over in exchange for little to nothing. And he does random shit to protect his image angel tree shopping when even then he bought low grade gifts for those kids. 

And his fans have the most terrible comebacks ever. It genuinely feels like arguing with Patrick from SpongeBob. “He has 500k saved” yeah and he still unplugs his fridge lmao. Despite all that he calls all of us “brokies” for getting a daily coffee.

I’ve been an instant coffee drinker for years — nothing fancy, just a quick caffeine fix with milk and sugar. But a few months ago I decided to try freshly brewed coffee at home, and honestly… it completely changed how I look at coffee as a whole.
I started with beans/grounds from Blue Tokai, and the difference was wild. The aroma alone made me feel like I was doing something special. The taste is so much more complex — nutty, chocolatey, sometimes even naturally sweet. I even started appreciating coffee black!
The whole brewing process — from grinding to blooming to waiting — makes the whole experience feel more intentional and enjoyable compared to just stirring instant into hot water.
The only problem?
Fresh coffee is definitely more expensive (especially where I live), and while I love the quality, my wallet isn’t always happy about it 😂.
So I’m turning to you all — what are some cheaper ground coffee alternatives that still taste good when freshly brewed? I’m open to beans, grounds, or even recommendations on budget brands that are worth trying.
Have any of you gone through this “instant → fresh coffee awakening” phase? What affordable coffee do you brew at home that still tastes great?

1pw52is,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1pw52is/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

The one at 200 has less brightness, a creamier mouthfeel and is still smooth but the acidity is muted.

I sit afterwards with my quiet vulnerability asking myself, why? I never imagined that 15 years after leaving this cult I would come to find the answer.

I was 18 years old when I was disfellowshipped.  I never spoke to those elders. I couldn’t. I kept a journal hidden my whole life. I wrote in it daily. It was my sanity and the only place I felt safe enough to write the things I could never tell my mother.  It was a raw internal monologue of every doubt, action, and feeling I had that never aligned with the org.

I remember when she called me. I was out pretending to do a bible study. I was already suppressing my guilt. She said some brothers had visited and she wanted me home. I told her I’d be there within the hour. When I walked into my living room, my journal sat there on the coffee table. Open. Three men I had come to consider family sat on my couch -men who had watched me grow up, read from that journal.

My blood ran cold. I couldn’t breathe. I was frozen for 2 entire, eternal seconds before I turned around and walked out that door. Where do I go?

The humiliation of these men reading my private thoughts overwhelmed every other feeling. The betrayal. My mother not only read it; she called the elders in too. I simply could not ever look at their faces again. I ignored them all for weeks. I was excommunicated shortly after that and the humiliation and violation of my words being used against me kept me from ever touching a journal again.

I'm tired of the shameful silence. Tired of those who think healing means silence. Not to me, not anymore. My stories are restoring an old wound that I rushed past. A wound I slapped a band-aid on when it needed me to suck out the poison and give it stiches.  Silence didn’t heal me; it only paused the voice I was scared to trust for so long.

I'm sharing these stories because I can. Because no one will ever use my words against me again. Because I no longer need permission, approval, or validation. I just need existence. I just need truth.

The stories in this forum have touched me. The people in this forum have inspired me.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn’t come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them.

I have two men and one straight woman as friends, they are the best people in my life but they can't relate to WLW. It just is what it is.

I feel so lost, and so tired. I can't understand why people keep leaving me for stupid/small reasons. Like I don't even lie, someone left me for my coffee addiction (we were not together but anyway) and today, after 4 f***ng days, someone left me again. This time we were in a relationship, if we can call that even. It's not all about her leaving me, but, she hurt me so badly by BLOCKING ME while I was in my deepest freaking feelings, ready to explain why I felt like I felt. I was basically overthinking of her leaving me for a small reason earlier, while she was sleeping. There was not drama from my side when that happened. I asked from her ""Is everything fine?"" and told her that I was worried and overthinking etc etc AFTER her reply. I was trying my hardest to explain why I feel like this, and she replied ""Can we talk about this tomorrow?"" and when I asked why, she said ""Because I'm tired"" and there I said ""I don't f***ng know"" because I felt like I wasn't heard. My feelings were not heard. And for what? Her ""being tired"", like there wasn't this thing at all. Like there wasn't my emotions, my FEELINGS that I tried to explain in a best possible way. I didn't try to hurt her. I don't even like to hurt people, even when I'm not obviously perfect and I make mistakes sometimes that hurt other peoples feelings. But this time, I tried my hardest. I tried to be open about my feelings without saying badly to her. Even when I felt so bad myself, I didn't want to lash it out on her.
She later EDITED her already sent message (after blocking me and not giving me a chance to say anything) explaining that it's mentally too tiring for her that she needs probably a gf ""around her age"" and blah blah.

This is not first time when I get left for something as stupid, but what made it hurt this much because I decided to trust even once to make it work, and she does the exact same as everyone else. She also lied to me. Said that she will never let me go, that she understands me. And she was the one who planned the future meetings. We aligned with the future goals, from being monogamously committed to marrying and possibly kids too. I understand if me having mental health problems and abandonment issues was too much for her, but again, I didn't hear the real reason. There was not a chance to talk about things even, since she made this decision by herself, without my opinion.

I know that she's not the only woman in world. But the problem is not this. It's that my trust for feeling fully safe with a woman is heavily shattered or even broken. Who wants to be in love, when every time this same thing happens? I bet that you would think the same as me if you were in my shoes. I'm lost, I'm tired, and I'm simply done. No one will want me anyway when I'm not confident enough, so what's the point anymore. Especially when they all just do that for me.

I don't believe anymore that love is for me. I always believed on it though. Since I was a little girl, I always thought that I will find myself a wife and we will settle down. I wish it would happen. But there's nothing I can offer anymore to someone. This is my first and my last vulnerable post here. If you hate me for this, go ahead, I don't care.

So me (32m) upset my 'fiancee' (38f) the other day... we have known each other for about 15 years. We met on hiking trail taking part in a sponsored walk. I put my arm around her and helped encouraged her to keep going and finished. We both started chatting, laughing and joking as much as you can when you are about 15km in on a 20km walk, neither of us really trained that much it turns out... anyway we finish a I spent an hour with her cooling down with drink whilst the reast of my ""team"" finished their walks.

She left and we would chat on Facebook, on and off over the years she was in a relationship it didn't work out and broke up about 10 years ago. I have been on a few dates and been in one serious relationship in this time.. She lives about an hour from me but never met since then, work life and just being background friends anyway 6 months ago we started chatting more, got to know each other again. 

About 3 weeks ago in the middle of our messages she said she wanted prank friends  and would I be ok if we changed our relationship on Facebook to Married... of course being a joke and loving to wind my friends up i was like yeah why not... all ny friends are shocked as I had been 18months out of a rather toxic and abusive relationship and said im  no longer looking for relationships and definitely not getting married, to my friends. Friends were so happy for me being married and messaging me asking if this is serious, of course im giving out non comital answers, like it seems its true, its on Facebook. The next day my 'wife' asked me how I am and what I thought of all this and I was like well I know its all a joke for friends. I said I had always found her attractive. She asked would you like this to continue, thinking all this was like its all joke for friends im fine with that. Anyway she then asks shall we get married and im like id like to see how we get on in person etc. (Being AuDHD, socially awkward misreading signs and subtlties felt like a kid at Christmas someone wants to actually get to know me and everything.)

So Anyway days go by chatting, messaging etc. I work 8-12 hour days 5-7 days a week so havent had chance to meet her yet. Her mum is rushed in to hospital seriously ill and is there for a few days. I ask anything I can do to help. Im happy to come down meet her for a coffee and a chat or anything within reason, thinking im well aware some normal 'date' stuff would be out the window. she gets angry and upset for not 'reading the room' im just offering to help in some way, thinking maybe give her '5 minutes' escape from hospitals etc We are also talk about weddings and what we would like... what time of year we would like to get married, we agree on Spring/Summer time. So lovely. Anyway yesterday she is round with her dad whilst mum is still in hospital. We chat on the phone and dad wants to talk to me, ok sure (we all know if father wants to speak to the daughter's partner it is never good especially if the daughter is upset) he rips in to me, upset because his daughter is in tears, his is asking if im serious about his daughter, explaining im interested in seeing where our relationship could go, and yes im serious about marriage one day and telling me I need to be serious and be looking out for her, understandably its father looking out for his daughter.

So AITAH fot upsetting my, who is she? Wife?, Fiancee, friend, partner, girlfriend, im just as confused by all this as you probably all are... I'll update once the dust as settled and i know more...

Apparently this upset and hurt is nothing to do with Christmas, mum being in hospital it is all to do with me. Yes i can be a bit of an idiot at times not understanding stuff, especially relationships and subtlties, gotta love being wired up wrongly as foetus..",1,1766757551.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

—

Back in June 2, someone said that ILLT Coffee —the cafe where Minkyung and Baekhyun had their first date— was booked for the day. The date was held during their second day in the house, hence why I believe that the start of the filming was on June 1. With this, we can establish the timeline itself. 

Their last day in South Korea was on June 9. They flew to Japan on the next day, I don't think they had a free day between their last day in Seoul and the flight to Japan as when Jaehyung offered to pack some of Hyunji's workout clothes, he was already wearing the checkered button down shirt he used in flight to Japan. But then again, I can also be incorrect as everyone else wore something different.

• June 10 - flight to Japan + dates + ex reveals

• June 11 - by midnight, men chose the dates for their X + the date for that + women chooses the dates for their X

• June 12 - dates 

• June 13 - free day

Now, even during Seasons 1 and 2, they never really filmed for exactly 21 days. In Season 3, their time in Jeju went: Day 1 (flight to Japan), Day 2 (new tenant date), Day 3 & 4 (X selects date for X), Day 5 (free day), Day 6 (two way date + truth or drink), Day 7 (X date + secret date), and Day 8 (final selection). 

It's very likely that this season would follow the timeline of Season 3 as they have the same production staff. So, basically:

• June 14 - two way date + truth or drink

• June 15 - X Dates + secret dates

• June 16 - final selection

If they had a free day between their last day in Seoul, you may adjust the date and June 17 is likely gonna be their final selection day, but this can still be adjusted if there's gonna be another catfish (I highly doubt this) which meant there's gonna be a new tenant designated date or the production staff decided to create a new date theme as a replacement for that supposed date for the new tenant. 

—

This is where the leaked pictures of Hyunji and Yoosik gets confusing. The person who posted their photos said that it was taken on June 18, which is either the final selection day or it's for the after filming, but usually, the final selections are held in a more private place and there are a lot of people around there. It also cannot be during the remaining dates as listed: free day (Yoosik and Hyunji are gonna go on a date and it's very likely it's the one from Trailer 1), two way date (pictures were taken on June 18 and this day is only 14), secret date (dates are taken after the X date but they are wearing different clothes from that photos).

1pw4uwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1pw4uwn/unsure_of_what_to_do_next/,Unsure of what to do next,"I (24F) met this guy (20M) through social media back in August. We started talking casually through DMs and eventually added each other on Snapchat. Communication wasn’t always consistent at first because we were both busy, but for the past couple of weeks we’ve been talking every day. We’ve called and FaceTimed before, so I knew he was legit and felt comfortable with him.
I recently went back to my hometown to visit family for the holidays, and he lives in the area. He offered to pick me up so I wouldn’t have to spend money on a ride, which I appreciated. We drove around for a bit and talked, and when he dropped me off he mentioned that if I was free during the week, we should hang out.
The next day we talked pretty much all day, and he asked if I’d want to go see a movie with him. I said yes, and we made plans. On the day of, while he was on his way to pick me up, he asked if I’d be okay going to his family’s holiday dinner with him first. He said it was small and casual and that we wouldn’t stay long, and then we’d go to the movie after. I was nervous because I’m very shy, but I agreed.
Dinner was nice, and we actually ended up spending around 8–9 hours together total. Before dinner, I asked if his family might assume anything, and he said no — that he’s brought friends before and it would be fine. At one point, when we invited his family to come to the movies with us, someone joked “it’s okay, you two can go romantically,” and he brushed it off.
We didn’t end up being able to see the movie we planned because he was on call for work and got called in. He was visibly upset about having to go in. Since he had picked me up, he couldn’t drive me home in time, so he made sure I had a safe place to wait and told me to stay in the car so I wouldn’t get cold. He paid for our drinks earlier and the movie tickets, and I paid for coffee later in the night.
I’m heading back home in a couple of days and we won’t be able to see each other again before I leave. I’m just feeling confused — not upset, just unsure. I’m wondering if there might’ve been something more there, or if this was just friendly behavior and I’m reading too much into it. I know timing and distance are a factor, but I’d appreciate an outside perspective. ",1,1766757353.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

1pw4pes,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pw4pes/my_job_is_to_watch_a_priest_pray/,My job is to watch a priest pray,"The job opening wasn’t on LinkedIn, nor was it on any job board. It was handwritten in blue ballpoint pen on the back of a tax receipt pinned to the bulletin board of a 24-hour laundromat in downtown São Paulo.

""NIGHT WATCHMAN - PRIVATE SECTOR. $18,000.00/month + Bonuses. Requirements: No family, military or security background, strong stomach. Discreet. Contact the number below via Telegram only.""

Eighteen thousand dollars.

I read the number three times. At the time, I was living in a boarding house room that smelled of mold and old cooking oil. My bank account had been in the red for so long the manager didn’t even call me anymore. I’m an ex-military police officer, expelled from the force for ""excessive use of force"" and ""incompatible conduct"" (official code for alcoholism).

I had nothing to lose. I sent the message.

The reply came in thirty seconds. A GPS coordinate and a time: 03:00 AM.

The location was the underground garage of an abandoned commercial building in the Sé district. I was frisked by two men built like wardrobes wearing cheap suits. They took my phone, my wallet, my watch. They put a black hood over my head and shoved me into the back of a van.

They drove for four hours. From the swaying and the smell of earth coming through the vents, we left the city and hit a dirt road. Then, we went down. We went down a lot. I felt the pressure in my ears change, like when a plane lands.

When the hood was removed, I was in a white, sterile room lit by fluorescent bulbs.

Sitting at a metal table was Dr. Arantes. A thin man with gray skin and dark circles under his eyes so deep they looked like bruises. He didn’t smile. He didn’t greet me. He just pushed a stack of papers toward me.

“Level 5 Non-Disclosure Agreement,” he said, his voice dry as sand. “If you tell anyone what you see here, you don’t go to jail. You disappear. Your dental records vanish. Your birth certificate is erased. You never existed. Understood?”

“What is the job?” I asked, holding the pen. “Politician security? Organ trafficking?”

“Theological Containment Monitoring.”

I laughed. I thought it was a joke.

Arantes didn’t laugh.

“The salary is deposited into an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. You work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You sleep here. You eat here. Your life outside is over. Sign or leave.”

I signed. My hand shook a little, not from fear, but from alcohol withdrawal.

Arantes gathered the papers and stood up.

“Welcome to Project Cathedral. Let’s go down.”

We entered an industrial freight elevator. The panel had no numbers, just an up button and a down button. We descended for too long. Two minutes? Three?

“We are three hundred meters below the foundation of an 18th-century church,” Arantes explained, staring at the elevator ceiling. “The church above is a façade. What matters is what’s below.”

When the doors opened, the air was freezing. We walked down a concrete corridor lined with steel doors fitted with biometric locks. We reached the end of the hall. A control room.

It was small, claustrophobic, filled with high-resolution monitors, panels with blinking lights, and an industrial coffee maker. But the focus of the room was the window. A pane of reinforced glass, ten centimeters thick, looking into a gray concrete cell.

“That is your post,” Arantes pointed to the worn leather chair in front of the glass. “Sit.”

I obeyed. I looked through the glass.

The cell was a perfect concrete cube, maybe 4x4 meters. No furniture. No bed. No toilet. In the center, on a Persian rug that must have once been red but was now dark brown, a man was kneeling.

He was facing away from me. He wore a black cassock, torn and dirty. His hair was white, thin, falling over his gaunt shoulders. He was rocking his body slightly, back and forth.

“Who is he?” I asked.

“We call him Father Thomas. He is 94 years old. He has been in that room for forty-two years.”

“A prisoner?”

“Working. Just like you.”

Arantes flipped a switch on the panel. Sound invaded the control room.

It wasn’t silence. It was a low, constant hum, like a swarm of bees inside a cave.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh... Sssrr-aaa-tuh... Mmm-glll-w'nah...”

“Is he praying?” I asked, feeling a chill run up my spine. That language didn’t sound human. The consonants were too hard, too guttural.

“He is vocalizing,” Arantes corrected. “It’s a sonic blockade. A specific frequency. As long as he maintains this rhythm, the Door stays closed.”

“What door?”

Arantes ignored the question and pointed to the panel in front of me. There were three large buttons, protected by acrylic covers. Blue, Yellow, and Red.

“Pay attention, Jonas. These are your only responsibilities. The priest does not eat, does not drink water by mouth, does not sleep. He receives nutrition and stimulants intravenously. He wears high-absorption geriatric diapers that we change with robots every 24 hours. Your function is to ensure he does not stop. Ever.”

Arantes pointed to the Blue Button.

“Hydration and mild stimulant. If his voice falters, if he coughs, press Blue.”

Then he pointed to the Yellow Button.

“Shock of adrenaline and pure amphetamine. If he stops rocking. If his head droops. If it looks like he’s going to pass out. Press Yellow. It will hurt him a little. His heart will race to 200 beats per minute. But it will keep him awake.”

“And the Red one?” I asked. The button was larger than the others, with a black and yellow striped warning border.

Arantes looked at the cell. For the first time, I saw fear in that man’s eyes.

“If he dies. If the sound stops for more than ten seconds. If you see... things coming out of the floor. Press Red.”

“What does it do?”

“Total incineration. The cell is flooded with flammable corrosives. Everything inside turns to ash in three seconds.”

“So, that button basically kills him?”

“If we reach that point, Jonas, the priest doesn’t matter anymore. The Red is to seal the room. To ensure nothing comes out.”

Arantes put a hand on my shoulder.

“The shift is 12 hours. Do not sleep. The system monitors your eyes. If you close them for more than five seconds, the chair shocks you. Good luck.”

The first few months were a slow descent into madness. Boredom is the worst kind of torture. You sit there, staring at a dying old man, listening to that sound.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh...”

It isn’t a Christian prayer. I was raised in the church. I know Latin. That was older than Latin. It sounded like the language stones would speak if they had mouths.

I started studying Father Thomas. With the camera zoom, I saw details the glass hid. The skin on his knees didn’t exist anymore. The fabric of the cassock, the flesh, and the rug had fused into a mash of dried blood and pus. He was calcified to the floor. That old man couldn’t stand up even if he wanted to.

His hands, clasped in prayer, had nails grown long and curved, piercing the flesh of his own palms.

But the worst was the face. Every now and then, he would turn his head to the side in a spasm. He had no eyes. The sockets were empty, scarred holes. Someone—or he himself—had gouged them out years ago. And the mouth... the lips were open sores from so much friction.

In the fourth week, I found a ""Journal"" on the control room computer. It was a text file hidden in a system folder. Previous monitors left notes.

Monitor Silva (2015): ""He spoke to me today. Not the prayer. He whispered my name. The audio was off, but I read his lips. How does he know my name?""

Monitor Kowalski (2019): ""The shadows in the cell are wrong. The light comes from above, but the priest’s shadow points to the left. And sometimes, the shadow moves when he is still.""

Monitor Helena (2023): ""I dreamed of what is below. It is an ocean. But not of water. Of teeth. Thomas isn’t praying to God. He is singing to put the baby to sleep.""

Helena lasted three months. The log said ""Termination for medical reasons (psychotic break).""

I started doubting my own sanity. The sound of the prayer entered my dreams. I would wake up in my quarters (a concrete room on the same floor) whispering just like the priest. My throat hurt, as if I had been screaming all night.

In the sixth month, the routine was broken.

It was 02:00 AM. I was fighting sleep, drinking cold coffee.

Father Thomas stopped.

The silence in the room was like a gunshot. The audio monitor showed the flatline of silence. I jumped in my chair, hand hovering over the Blue Button.

But before I could press it, he spoke. In Portuguese. With a clear, young voice that shouldn’t have come out of that destroyed throat.

“Jonas.”

I froze. He was facing away, but I knew he was ""looking"" at me with those empty sockets.

“Press the Yellow, Jonas,” the voice said. “I need strength. He is waking up.”

I didn’t think. I pressed the Yellow Button.

I heard the hiss of the automatic injector in the cell. The priest’s body convulsed violently. His back arched at an impossible angle. I heard bones crack. He screamed—a dry, airless scream—and went back to praying.

But now, the rhythm was frantic. Too fast.

“KhlerrrthumnaghSsrrraaatuuhhMmmglllwnah...”

He sounded like a demonic rapper. The frequency rose. The reinforced glass in front of me began to vibrate.

The red phone on my desk rang. I didn’t even know that phone worked. I answered.

“What did you do?” It was Arantes’ voice. He sounded like he was just waking up.

“He asked for it! He stopped! I followed protocol!”

“The seismic activity level just spiked! You injected too much adrenaline! His heart won’t take it!”

I looked at the vital signs monitor. Heart rate: 210 bpm. Blood pressure: 240/150. The priest was going to explode.

“He is rising!” the priest shouted, breaking the prayer again.

This time, he turned. He rotated his torso 180 degrees. His spine snapped, breaking, but he turned. The eyeless face stared at me. He smiled. Black blood ran from his mouth.

“The door, Jonas. The door is creaking.”

And then, the floor of the cell gave way. It wasn’t a hole. The concrete simply became... liquid. The rug where the priest was kneeling sank. I saw Father Thomas’s body being swallowed by the earth. He didn’t scream. He kept praying as he sank into the gray slime bubbling on the floor.

The prayer became muffled, gurgling, until it vanished completely.

The heart monitor beeped. Flatline.

The sound stopped.

“Arantes!” I screamed into the phone. “He’s gone! The floor swallowed him!”

“The Red!” Arantes shouted. “PRESS THE DAMN RED BUTTON NOW!”

I lifted the acrylic cover. I punched the button. I closed my eyes, waiting for the flash of flammable chemicals, the heat, the explosion that would incinerate everything on the other side of the glass.

But... nothing happened.

The button didn’t work.

I opened my eyes. The cell wasn’t on fire. The cell was glowing.

A sickly violet light emanated from the hole in the floor where the priest had sunk. The temperature in my control room began to rise. 30 degrees. 40 degrees. The plastic on the monitors started to melt. The phone in my hand melted, burning my palm. I dropped it.

And then, the Thing began to emerge.

First, it was the fingers. Long, translucent claws, made of something that looked like smoking glass and TV static. They gripped the edge of the hole in the concrete. The size... my God. Each finger was the size of a grown human.

Then, the head. It had no face. A polygon of flesh and light that constantly changed shape. Looking at it made my eyes bleed. I felt hot, red tears running down my face.

The central computer in the room came to life. A text message appeared on the main screen, giant green letters on a black background.

CONTAINMENT SYSTEM FAILED.

OMEGA PROTOCOL INITIATED.

MANDATORY REPLACEMENT.

The doors to my control room locked. Titanium bars slammed down over the exit. A mechanical needle descended from the ceiling, right above my chair. I tried to get up, but the chair had magnetic locks on the wrists and ankles. They snapped shut with a metallic click.

I was trapped.

“No! No! Let me out!” I screamed.

The needle descended and pierced my neck. I felt a cold liquid invade my veins. It wasn’t poison.

It was clarity.

Suddenly, the fear vanished. The pain vanished. My mind expanded.

I understood.

I understood what Father Thomas was doing. He wasn’t praying to a God. He wasn’t asking for salvation. He was telling a story.

The Entity... Whatever that thing coming out of the hole was... is made of chaos. It is pure entropy. It wants to undo the universe, atom by atom. The only thing keeping it trapped is Order. And the purest form of Order is Repetition. Rhythm. The Word.

The ""prayer"" wasn’t magic. It was mathematics. A sequence of frequencies creating a physical barrier against chaos. A wall of solid sound.

But Thomas had stopped. The wall had fallen. Someone needed to raise the wall again.

The Thing in the cell was rising. It already occupied half the space. The concrete walls were cracking, turning to dust. If it touched the ceiling, if it touched the foundation of the church above... the world would end. Not in fire, but in silence. Everything would cease to exist.

I felt the words rising in my throat. I didn’t know them. But they were in the serum the needle injected. Liquid memory. The knowledge of all the monitors, of all the ""priests"" before Thomas.

My mouth opened against my will. My tongue twisted into a painful knot. The sound came out ragged, weak.

The Thing in the cell stopped. The spinning geometry hesitated. It ""looked"" at me through the glass.

I felt a crushing pressure on my brain, like an ocean trying to fit into a water glass.

“SHUT UP, WORM,” the Thing’s voice echoed in my mind. It was pure murderous intent.

But I couldn’t shut up. The drug in my blood wouldn’t let me. The biological imperative was now: Pray or die.

“Khlerrr-thum-nagh...” I spoke louder.

The Thing recoiled an inch. The black slime on the floor bubbled. It hated the sound. The sound was Order. The sound was a cage.

The Thing let out a screech that blew out the remaining monitors in the room. Glass flew everywhere, cutting my face. But I didn’t stop.

The rhythm took me.

My body began to rock, back and forth, mimicking Thomas’s movement. It was the only way to pump the diaphragm to keep my breath.

The Thing began to shrink. The violet light dimmed. It was being pushed back into the hole by the weight of my words. It fought. Claws scratched the reinforced glass, leaving deep gouges right in front of my face.

But I kept going.

It sank. Slowly, inch by inch, the nightmare returned to the earth. The concrete floor, which had been liquid, began to solidify again, sealing the hole.

In ten minutes, the cell was empty. Only the dirty rug and Thomas’s bloodstains remained.

I sat there, panting, trapped in the chair. I waited for the doors to open. I waited for Arantes to come get me out, congratulate me, give me my money.

But the doors didn’t open.

The needle in my neck injected another dose. Nutrients. Water. Stimulants.

The intercom clicked on.

“Excellent work, Jonas,” Arantes voice said. “The transition was smoother than we expected. Thomas took three days to find the rhythm the first time.”

“Get me out of here!” I tried to scream, but the words didn’t come out. My throat was locked in ""prayer"" mode. I could only make the guttural sounds.

“You cannot leave,” Arantes continued, calm. “The frequency must be maintained within line of sight. The glass is the focusing lens. You are the new projector. The audio system was destroyed, Jonas. Now, it is just your voice. Direct into the room’s acoustics.”

The lights in the control room went out. Only a dim light remained on, illuminating the empty cell on the other side of the glass.

And a new button lit up on the panel in front of me. A button that injected water into my mouth through a tube that came out of the headrest.

“The contract was for life, Jonas. You should have read the fine print. 'Monitoring and Containment'. You are the Containment now.”

That was... I don’t know how long ago. There is no clock here.

My knees hurt, even though I’m sitting. I feel like they are trying to fuse to the chair. My eyes burn. I don’t blink anymore. And my voice... my voice isn’t mine anymore. It is a constant hum, an organic machine built to keep the demon sleeping.

Sometimes, when exhaustion hits and I slow the rhythm, I see it. The floor of the cell starts to sweat that black slime. And I hear its voice, from down below, laughing at me.

“Sing, little bird. Sing until your throat tears. I have all the time in the world. And you only have one life.”

My name was Jonas. Now, I am just the sound.

God help us.

Like clockwork, at 2:30 PM, I’d hit a wall. Brain fog, sleepy, couldn't focus. I was chugging coffee trying to wake up, but nothing worked.

Then I actually looked at what I was doing during my ""break"".

Honestly, I was exhausting myself before I even took a bite. First, I’d waste 15 minutes just arguing with myself about where to eat. Then I’d go stand in a loud, crowded line for another 20 minutes. By the time I actually sat down, I was already drained just from the logistics.

Then came the food itself. I was eating the standard office stuff, big sandwiches, pasta, rice bowls. Turns out, I was basically sedating myself. The carb spike hits, then the insulin crash knocks you out an hour later.

So I stopped treating lunch like entertainment and started treating it like a pit stop.

**The Fix:**

* **I stopped deciding.** I pick one spot or bring the same thing. No more debating.
* **I skip the line.** I order ahead or bring food. No more standing in the chaos.
* **I changed the fuel.** High protein, no heavy carbs (like a salad with double chicken).

The crash completely disappeared.

For example, he’ll ask me to meet, I suggest coffee, he’ll counter suggest (always his parents’), but agrees to Starbucks - then he’ll ask me where we’re meeting.","I’m dating someone who openly describes himself as a people pleaser, but it feels like that only applies to everyone except me.

We’ve known each other for 20 years (childhood neighbors) and dated for about four years (long distance for over half) until last month, when I broke up with him because I was fed up. He basically acted like we never broke up and didn’t even tell his family.

According to him, at work, with friends, and with family, he bends over backwards. With me, it’s the opposite. Any time I suggest something, he agrees reluctantly and then complains about the cost, huffs and puffs, or becomes passive aggressive. He won’t outright say he doesn’t like my suggestion, but it’s very obvious. He’s honestly miserable company when this happens. When we do something he wants, though, there’s zero resistance or negativity.

Over time, I stopped suggesting things because it felt pointless. I already knew how it would go.

A recurring example: he wants to meet up just to talk. I suggest Starbucks. He insists I come over to his parents’ house instead. He’ll say, “Sure, Starbucks is fine,” but then immediately add, “my parents really want to see you.” I repeat that I still want Starbucks. Then he asks again later, “Hey, where are we meeting?” An hour before the agreed time, he’ll call again and ask the same question, like if he keeps asking, I’ll eventually change my answer.

For context, the Starbucks is literally half a mile away from our parents’ houses.

What really messes with me is that when I broke things off last month, suddenly the “people pleaser” came back. He became agreeable, attentive, and thoughtful. He even left a gift basket outside my parents’ house yesterday. But once he feels secure again, that effort disappears.

It feels like he knows he doesn’t need to please me because he already has me, so he redirects all that energy elsewhere.  The only way to keep him from being toxic is to distance myself from him.

Am I overreacting for feeling exhausted and disrespected by this dynamic? Or is repeatedly pushing until you get the answer you want just manipulation dressed up as “people pleasing”?",4,1766756575.0,AmIOverreacting,16,1.0,False

We have no set schedule because my 2 year old constantly will wake her or stimulate her while I’m trying to help aid her in sleep. Husband also works from home so I have to help keep him quiet as possible (trying to move so this won’t be an issue). Baby also wakes instantly when lower than a 45 degree angle when being set down for naps. 

I set her down to fall asleep independently with no crying for night time. Night time she is waking every 3 hours. She becomes inconsolable unless boob is in her mouth. She falls asleep in about 3 minutes once she starts sucking. I try to quickly put paci in but then she becomes furious. 

She wants to co sleep and stay latched all night. I’ve co slept some for sanity purposes but I don’t sleep as well and I worry about suffocation despite taking precautions as I’m a very deep sleeper. 

Any tips on how to help her back to sleep without her becoming dependent on me as a paci? 

Other info: she is breastfed but also supplemented with formula as she has several allergies or intolerances and GI only wants me to limit diet restrictions to just dairy and soy. I know she has other sensitivities like coffee, coconut, avocado, banana, but he wants me to introduce so she doesn’t develop a full-blown allergy when she’s older.

I started my career as a junior software engineer in London, worked insane hours to cross £100K/year as soon as I could (my own gold standard), moved to management, and ultimately headed a team of 40 before realising that from here corporate politics becomes the dominant skill required rather than the occasional necessary evil, so I opted to focus on scaling my two side projects (financial data products) instead.

Looking back, it’s like I spent my 20s chasing a bus. And like most people, once I caught it, I forgot I’d eventually need to get off.

# This is a different kind of bus

The trouble is that many people chase the bus and get on it without knowing that this bus is not a transport vehicle, taking you from point A to point B. It is more a tourist/excursion coach where there are many interesting stops along the way. It’s your job to press the ‘Stop’ button and get off once you think you have reached a suitable destination.

When I chose the path of becoming a software engineer, my initial goal was clearly “I want to make 100K a year working as a developer” . I think the round number made me feel like it would be a special kind of accomplishment and very few people reach that number (I told myself), hence that’s a good spot to aim for. I’m in the UK and the salaries are not as high as they are in the U.S. so 100K is generally quite hard to achieve.

Through strategic job hopping, long hours upskilling myself, and CV+Interview prep and some luck from market timing, I made this number within a few years. I remember one of my siblings coming across my payslip one day accidentally (these were printed back then) and telling me “Woh, I didn’t know making that much was actually possible in a job . I can do it too.”. That was a nice feeling.

But then immediately my goal post shifted to “Oh now I want to be in management, and build a team”.

This started the journey to my next stop, in some ways negating some of the effort I had made to becoming technically stronger, not paying as much attention to developing my soft skills.

Another round of upskilling, job hopping, interviewing and I eventually landed a role as a development manager, leading a team of 6. Yet, within a month I was thinking “This is interesting, I’d like a bigger team”. The goal post moved again to leading a big team, which obviously needed me to move up.

Fast forward another few years, I made it to a department head role with about 40 people in my reporting line. That was nice. Just taking a walk around the office campus (this was pre-covid) with the team on our monthly casual lunches was a strange feeling. At that level , you wield significance influence over people’s careers. It’s not a ‘game’ anymore.

**My bus stop**

The goal post could then have easily shifted to ‘Now it’s time to be a director, 100+ strong team, higher status, more money!” By this time I had learnt the many nuances of building teams, developing people, navigating corporate culture, managing upwards and downwards while maintaining a balanced life, a family, exercise and travelling.

Continuing and achieving a senior IT director level over the next few years was certainly within reach (beyond that it is a much different game, outside this article’s scope). But I decided to stop.

I stopped because even at that level, corporate politics and perception management was starting to take a bigger and bigger role. I was comfortable with strategic manoeuvring in small, manageable doses but when politics start to become the job, I had to consider if it was time to get off.

With the aim to keep my technical skills sharp and also to diversify my income , I had also spent the past 6 years building two niche financial data products serving a specific need of the Mergers & Acquisition and Compliance niches. These had now started to generate steady revenue and , while working on these, I had learnt that there is no greater pleasure for me in life than sitting in a coffee shop, working on my own projects.

So I made my decision. No more climbing the corporate ladder. Continued success in the side projects is not guaranteed but I had enough of a financial safety net that even a modest level of continued success would be enough for my purpose.

So I took a part time role, focusing more on my side projects, which are not really “side” projects anymore. These likely won’t make 100K in recurring annual income anytime soon but they bring in enough that I feel happy getting off here.

Whether what I’ve achieved counts as success depends on your lens. That’s not important. What matters is knowing when you’ve reached ‘enough.’ There must be a point where you can ring the bell and announce to yourself ,“I have arrived!”.

**My bus stop**

The goal post could then have easily shifted to ‘Now it’s time to be a director, 100+ strong team, higher status, more money!” By this time I had learnt the many nuances of building teams, developing people, navigating corporate culture, managing upwards and downwards while maintaining a balanced life, a family, exercise and travelling.

Continuing and achieving a senior IT director level over the next few years was certainly within reach (beyond that it is a much different game, outside the scope of this post). But I decided to stop.

I stopped because even at that level, corporate politics and perception management was starting to take a bigger and bigger role. I was comfortable with strategic manoeuvring in small, manageable doses but when politics start to become *the* job, I had to consider if it was time to get off.

With the aim to keep my technical skills sharp and also to diversify my income , I had also spent the past 6 years building two niche financial data products serving a specific need of the Mergers & Acquisition and Compliance niches. These had now started to generate steady revenue and , while working on these, I had learnt that there is no greater pleasure for me in life than sitting in a coffee shop, working on my own projects.

So I made my decision. No more climbing the corporate ladder. Continued success in the side projects is not guaranteed but I had enough of a financial safety net that even a modest level of continued success would be enough for my purpose.

So I took a part time role, focusing more on my side projects, which are not really “*side”* projects anymore. These likely won’t make 100K in recurring annual income anytime soon but they bring in enough that I feel happy getting off here.

Whether what I’ve achieved counts as success depends on your lens. That’s not important. What matters is knowing when you’ve reached ‘enough.’ There must be a point where you can ring the bell and announce to yourself ,“I have arrived!”.

Look for your stop. And when you find it, don’t be afraid to get off.",0,1766756214.0,careeradvice,0,0.33,False
1pw4gpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pw4gpi/catcam/,Catcam,"Kyle stood in the hallway outside the apartment, shifting his weight from foot to foot while police sirens wailed somewhere nearby. They sounded close but in this neighborhood, sirens were just part of the ambience. The cracked paint on the walls peeled like scabs from gunshots that wounded its exterior. Someone’s door down the hall even had a boot print in it.

Kyle checked his phone again.

No answer.

Kyle adjusted the strap of his backpack, the weight of it pressing into his shoulders. Four hours. Four hours indoors, heat, running water, and a couch. That was all he needed.

“Hello?” he said toward the door. “I’m Kyle. The catsitter. From Rover.”

Nothing.

Then his phone buzzed.

“Door’s unlocked. Go ahead :)”

Kyle hesitated, then turned the knob.

The smell hit him immediately. It was like rot drowned in bleach.  He paused just inside the doorway, sniffed his jacket, then his shirt. No. The bad smell was not him… for once. Kyle stepped inside and hoped his nose would get used to the smell. It had grown nose blind to worse after all. 

The apartment was dim but warm, cluttered in the way of a place that had been lived in for years without ever being reorganized. Shoes sat by the door in uneven pairs. A half-folded blanket slumped over the back of the couch. The walls were crowded with plenty of framed photographs. Pics of European vacations, crowded birthday parties, and camp outs by the lake. In every single one there there was a smiling couple. A man and a woman who looked like they belonged in a far better neighborhood than this one, but times were hard. Kyle knew that better than anyone. 

It took him a moment to notice it, but once he did, Kyle couldn’t unsee it. It was the kind of thing that stood out like a sore thumb among the clutter of nicknacks and funko pops. It was a small device sitting on a shelf in the living room. It was unmistakable. There was a vintage-looking webcam pointed straight at the couch.

A catcam.

“Well,” Kyle muttered. “Hello there.”

His phone buzzed. It was the rover app. He had a message from the pet owner. 

**“**So glad you’re here! Not many people want to take this job. It's a rough area! But the best part of cat sitting is you never have to leave the house :)”

Sirens passed outside again as Kyle tried to find the cat. 

His phone buzzed again, “Cat’s name is Jasper. He’s unfriendly and hides. Don’t take it personally.”

That explains the cat being missing, Kyle thought. He took a load off on the couch.

“Make yourself comfortable. BUT NOT TOO COMFORTABLE!” Kyle’s eyebrows raised at the last part, but he didn't think too much of it. He was a stranger in their home after all.

“Last and certainly not least, DO NOT USE THE BATHROOM. The gas station down the street will let you use theirs if you don’t look too homeless so you better buy a pack of gum or something if you gotta go lol. No offense. I can factor that into your pay.

Kyle stared at the screen.

“What,” he whispered, “I can’t use the bathroom?”

Almost instantly, a reply appeared. “I have a thing about other people’s fluids being where I bathe.

Kyle tossed the phone onto the coffee table and shrugged it off. He didn’t have to go that bad anyway.

He brushed his teeth using bottled water. The soap dispenser was empty, so he dug into his bag and pulled out a bar of soap, scraping grime from beneath his fingernails. He was halfway done when his phone buzzed again.

**“**Wow, you sure brought a lot for four hours. Making yourself feel more at HOME?”

Kyle ignored it and collapsed onto the couch.

That's when he heard the Ding of the Rover app again.

**“**Shoes off!”

Kyle looked up. The catcam’s tiny red light blinked. He forced a smile at it, thin and uneasy as he took his shoes off for the camera.

Another buzz. “Thank you! Comfy now? ;)

Kyle nodded at the catcam which felt strange to do. He didn’t like that he was being watched at all times.  

“Remember…four hours. That’s all. You’ve got this!”

Kyle sighed as turned on the TV and began to whittle those hours away.

After three hours passed, Kyle finally got a little concerned. Jasper was nowhere to be found. If he was gonna get paid to catsit, he should at least lay eyes on the damn thing before he leaves. 

Kyle checked under the couch. Behind the TV stand. The kitchen, where empty cleaning bottles lay scattered like casualties. No cat among them.

“Jasper?” he called. “Here, kitty kitty.”

Nothing.

He texted the owner.

“Can’t find Jasper. Is he… real?” Kyle added a lol at the end to sound less hostile. 

The response came immediately as it always did.

**“**He’s real. Just sneaky. Try under the couch, the closet, or the TV stand.”

Kyle checked the couch again. Still nothing.

The closet slid open with a dry scrape.

Boxes. Old clothes.

And a knife.

It was big, heavy, and a little too clean…

Kyle picked it up, feeling the weight, then set it back where he found it. On the floor nearby lay a collar tag. It was Jasper’s.

He texted again.

“Found his collar tag I see.” Kyle wasn’t anywhere near the catcam when he got that text. Before he could even consider that, he was bombarded by more texts. “GREAT! You’re on his trail. His collar must’ve slipped off as he’s lost a lot of weight. He should be nearby!”

Kyle stared at the tag. There was a dark smear on it. Maybe rust. Maybe dried bits of cat food. He guessed anything but what it truly was.

The knife and the tag smelled the same though. That Kyle did pick up on. It was that deep chemical smell that laced the bitter air of the apartment .

Especially near the bathroom door. The stench there was worse than anywhere else as the bleach smell lost the fight to whatever else was in there. It was thick, sour, and unmistakable wrong.

Kyle reached for the knob and right as he did, the phone buzzed. 

**“**Remember what I said. NO BATHROOM!”

Kyle stepped back. His phone trembled in his hand as he typed, “Look man, I can’t find Jasper anywhere.”

 “Keep looking.”

He did. Over and over. Every corner. Every shadow. No cat was to be found. By the end of the four hours, Kyle slumped on the couch, exhausted. He drank from his water bottle and his phone buzzed as he took a long gulp.

“Thirsty?”

Kyle took an exaggerated Ahh after the sip and looked straight at the catcam as he did.

Another buzz, “You’re not looking anymore. If you lost my cat, you’re in a world of trouble, Kyle. Bad review territory BUDDY!” 

Kyle stood up and got right up to the catcam, “All right,” he said to the camera. “I’m done. Your cat can be alone for a few hours. I’m leaving.”

Kyle slung his backpack over one shoulder and turned for the door. That’s when he noticed the curtains...They were moving.

Not swaying from air conditioning or traffic outside, but pulling inward with the wind. The curtains drew back just enough to expose a window standing wide open. Night air poured in, cold and sharp, carrying the distant everpresent sound of sirens.

Kyle’s heart jumped into his throat.

“No,” he whispered.

He rushed over and slammed the window shut, fumbling with the lock until it clicked. His hands were shaking now. He pulled out his phone and typed fast.

“The window was open. I didn’t open it. I think Japser might have gotten out.”

Kyle waited for an immediate reply, but got nothing. That was strange. The owner never waited.

Kyle stared at the phone, thumb hovering, when suddenly he heard something.

“Meow.” It came from deeper inside the apartment… from the bedroom.

Kyle froze at the sound, “Jasper?” he called softly.

Another meow answered. But something about it made Kyle’s skin crawl. It was too slow. Too deliberate. The sound lingered at the end, stretching in a way that didn’t quite belong to an animal.

Kyle stepped toward the bedroom, every instinct screaming at him to leave instead. As he passed the bathroom, the smell hit him again. Now that he wasn’t trying to ignore it, it only made it more obvious.

He stopped as the pieces finally slid together. The knife…The collar…The no bathroom rule.

“Meow.” It was closer to Kyle this time.

His phone buzzed again causing him to jump, **“**Did you double check the closet? It’s bigger than it looks. You’d be shocked what can hide in there.”

The meow came again. It was closer and sounded… wrong. Almost strained. Almost pleading.

Kyle didn’t respond. Instead, he stepped into the bedroom, eyes darting to every shadow, every corner. The closet door stood slightly ajar, darkness spilling from inside like a held breath.

“MEOW.” That’s not a cat. 

Kyle slammed the bedroom door shut. His phone buzzed violently after doing that.

 “CHECK THE CLOSET! CHECK THE CLOSET! CHECK THE CLOSET!”

Kyle backed away from the bedroom door and turned toward the bathroom instead. The smell was unbearable now that he knew what it was.

Kyle opened the door. He didn’t scream, but he wanted to. He found the cat…and what looked like a woman…in pieces.

Kyle's phone buzzed. “Don’t even think about calling the cops.”

Kyle typed with shaking hands, “You’re a sick fuck.”

**“**You tell anyone and they’ll arrest you. Your DNA’s everywhere. You touched the murder weapon. You’re the homeless guy in the apartment. Who will they believe?

Kyle couldn’t believe that they actually thought they’d get away with this. “They’ll see the messages. It’s your apartment. It’s your girlfriend in there.”

The immediate reply, **“**Who said this is my apartment?” Kyle’s blood ran cold. Another message appeared not long after, “Did you even count the limbs?”

And then the bedroom door creaked open. The space beyond was a black void, no light at all, just a shape lurking in the dark.

“MEOW.”  

Kyle didn’t think twice. He spun on his heel and bolted for the door. He tore through the apartment, heart pounding, and flung himself out into the hallway. The stairwell down to the street was just a few steps away. But as he reached the top of the stairs, he felt a shove. Kyle stumbled, losing his footing, and went down the stairs hard. His head hit the concrete landing, and the world spun away into darkness.

When he came to, the flashing lights of police cars were painting the night in red and blue. He was being dragged to his feet, handcuffed, and shoved toward a squad car. He tried to explain, but with his phone and ID both mysteriously missing, he was just a stranger found at the scene. They’d found the bodies inside, and the story wrote itself. A homeless guy with no alibi and the murder weapon covered in his fingerprints found unconscious fleeing the apartment… Kyle was done for.

He told them about the Rover messages, but was told the accounts he named no longer existed and lying about having a home address on Rover could constitute fraud. As if Kyle cared at that point. 

When he mentioned the catcam, the one thing that might have proved his innocence, they told him no such device had been recovered from the crime scene and that he should confess for a lighter sentence. 

Kyle confessed and was executed by the State of Texas last week, his case now officially closed. A day after the Dallas police department received a strange package. Inside it was Kyle's ID, phone, and... a cat cam.

Some people treat themselves to a coffee, some take a night off, some go out with friends, others just enjoy doing nothing without guilt.

I’m currently working on a small project that experiments with self-defined rewards (basically a personal “shop” where you unlock things you’ve earned), and I’m trying to understand what people *actually* use in real life — not what sounds good in theory.

So I’m curious:

* What’s a reward you genuinely look forward to after completing something?
* Is it food, rest, experiences, spending time with people, or something else?
* Do your rewards change depending on the size of the achievement?

I’m collecting ideas to see what patterns come up and which rewards people naturally gravitate toward, so I can pre-fill some sensible defaults instead of guessing.

Would love to hear how you personally reward progress or consistency.",1,1766756200.0,Productivitycafe,2,1.0,False

“Found his collar tag I see.” Kyle wasn’t anywhere near the catcam when he got that text. Before he could even consider that, he was bombarded by more texts. “GREAT! You’re on his trail. His collar must’ve slipped off as he’s lost a lot of weight. He should be nearby!”

Kyle stared at the tag. There was a dark smear on it. Maybe rust. Maybe dried bits of cat food. He guessed anything but what it truly was.

The knife and the tag smelled the same though. That Kyle did pick up on. It was that deep chemical smell that laced the bitter air of the apartment .

Especially near the bathroom door. The stench there was worse than anywhere else as the bleach smell lost the fight to whatever else was in there. It was thick, sour, and unmistakable wrong.

Kyle reached for the knob and right as he did, the phone buzzed. 

**“**Remember what I said. NO BATHROOM!”

Kyle stepped back. His phone trembled in his hand as he typed, “Look man, I can’t find Jasper anywhere.”

 “Keep looking.”

He did. Over and over. Every corner. Every shadow. No cat was to be found. By the end of the four hours, Kyle slumped on the couch, exhausted. He drank from his water bottle and his phone buzzed as he took a long gulp.

“Thirsty?”

Kyle took an exaggerated Ahh after the sip and looked straight at the catcam as he did.

Another buzz, “You’re not looking anymore. If you lost my cat, you’re in a world of trouble, Kyle. Bad review territory BUDDY!” 

Kyle stood up and got right up to the catcam, “All right,” he said to the camera. “I’m done. Your cat can be alone for a few hours. I’m leaving.”

Kyle slung his backpack over one shoulder and turned for the door. That’s when he noticed the curtains...They were moving.

Not swaying from air conditioning or traffic outside, but pulling inward with the wind. The curtains drew back just enough to expose a window standing wide open. Night air poured in, cold and sharp, carrying the distant everpresent sound of sirens.

Kyle’s heart jumped into his throat.

“No,” he whispered.

He rushed over and slammed the window shut, fumbling with the lock until it clicked. His hands were shaking now. He pulled out his phone and typed fast.

“The window was open. I didn’t open it. I think Japser might have gotten out.”

Kyle waited for an immediate reply, but got nothing. That was strange. The owner never waited.

Kyle stared at the phone, thumb hovering, when suddenly he heard something.

“Meow.” It came from deeper inside the apartment… from the bedroom.

Kyle froze at the sound, “Jasper?” he called softly.

Another meow answered. But something about it made Kyle’s skin crawl. It was too slow. Too deliberate. The sound lingered at the end, stretching in a way that didn’t quite belong to an animal.

Kyle stepped toward the bedroom, every instinct screaming at him to leave instead. As he passed the bathroom, the smell hit him again. Now that he wasn’t trying to ignore it, it only made it more obvious.

He stopped as the pieces finally slid together. The knife…The collar…The no bathroom rule.

“Meow.” It was closer to Kyle this time.

His phone buzzed again causing him to jump, **“**Did you double check the closet? It’s bigger than it looks. You’d be shocked what can hide in there.”

The meow came again. It was closer and sounded… wrong. Almost strained. Almost pleading.

Kyle didn’t respond. Instead, he stepped into the bedroom, eyes darting to every shadow, every corner. The closet door stood slightly ajar, darkness spilling from inside like a held breath.

“MEOW.” That’s not a cat. 

Kyle slammed the bedroom door shut. His phone buzzed violently after doing that.

 “CHECK THE CLOSET! CHECK THE CLOSET! CHECK THE CLOSET!”

Kyle backed away from the bedroom door and turned toward the bathroom instead. The smell was unbearable now that he knew what it was.

Kyle opened the door. He didn’t scream, but he wanted to. He found the cat…and what looked like a woman…in pieces.

Kyle's phone buzzed. “Don’t even think about calling the cops.”

Kyle typed with shaking hands, “You’re a sick fuck.”

**“**You tell anyone and they’ll arrest you. Your DNA’s everywhere. You touched the murder weapon. You’re the homeless guy in the apartment. Who will they believe?

Kyle couldn’t believe that they actually thought they’d get away with this. “They’ll see the messages. It’s your apartment. It’s your girlfriend in there.”

The immediate reply, **“**Who said this is my apartment?” Kyle’s blood ran cold. Another message appeared not long after, “Did you even count the limbs?”

And then the bedroom door creaked open. The space beyond was a black void, no light at all, just a shape lurking in the dark.

“MEOW.”  

Kyle didn’t think twice. He spun on his heel and bolted for the door. He tore through the apartment, heart pounding, and flung himself out into the hallway. The stairwell down to the street was just a few steps away. But as he reached the top of the stairs, he felt a shove. Kyle stumbled, losing his footing, and went down the stairs hard. His head hit the concrete landing, and the world spun away into darkness.

When he came to, the flashing lights of police cars were painting the night in red and blue. He was being dragged to his feet, handcuffed, and shoved toward a squad car. He tried to explain, but with his phone and ID both mysteriously missing, he was just a stranger found at the scene. They’d found the bodies inside, and the story wrote itself. A homeless guy with no alibi and the murder weapon covered in his fingerprints found unconscious fleeing the apartment… Kyle was done for.

He told them about the Rover messages, but was told the accounts he named no longer existed and lying about having a home address on Rover could constitute fraud. As if Kyle cared at that point. 

When he mentioned the catcam, the one thing that might have proved his innocence, they told him no such device had been recovered from the crime scene and that he should confess for a lighter sentence. 

Kyle confessed and was executed by the State of Texas last week, his case now officially closed. A day after the Dallas police department received a strange package. Inside it was Kyle's ID, phone, and... a cat cam.

That’s when she sat beside me.

She didn’t ask for help or directions. She just smiled and said, “Looks like we’re both stranded.”

We talked to kill time. Small things at first. Work, music, why we hated crowded trains but missed them when they stopped running. She laughed easily, the kind that made the empty platform feel less lonely.

When the rain slowed, she checked her phone and sighed.  
“No trains,” she said. “Guess this is where the night ends.”

We stood up together. At the exit, she hesitated.  
“Funny,” she said, “how you can meet someone at the wrong time and still wish it lasted longer.”

I wanted to ask for her number. I wanted to say something meaningful. Instead, I just nodded.

She walked away. I turned back toward the platform.

A train arrived moments later. Unscheduled. Quiet. Real.

As it pulled away, I wondered if missing the last train was the reason I met her, or the reason I lost the chance to know her better.

Some nights don’t give second chances.

1pw49ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1pw49ck/robyn_tried_money_magnet_mastery_a_30second/,Robyn Tried Money Magnet Mastery 🧲 a 30-Second Ritual to Fix a Stuck Financial Mindset—Here’s What Happened,"# 🧲 Money Magnet Mastery Review ...

You work hard. You save where you can. Yet your bank account still looks like it's recovering from a hangover.

Sound familiar? It's very common and you're definitely not cursed—despite what your inner critic might say.

Many people keep grinding without ever fixing the *actual* issue: what's going on between their ears.

If you’ve ever felt like **money slips away no matter what**, the problem might be less about income and more about mindset.

That’s where [Money Magnet Mastery](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/money-magnet-mastery-official) comes in. It skips the spreadsheets and hands you a 30-second ritual meant to shift your thinking about wealth. The claim? Change your thoughts, and your results follow.

Let’s dig into what this course offers—and whether it can help you **break the loop of financial frustration** without turning your life upside down.

# 📦 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Money Magnet Mastery
* **Category**: Mindset & Success ➝ Financial Mindset Programs
* **Overall Verdict**: 4/5

# 💸 What Is Money Magnet Mastery?

**Money Magnet Mastery** is a digital mindset course that focuses on helping users build **a mindset focused on financial abundance** using short, daily rituals.

Rather than dragging you through long videos or lectures, it centers around **the Money Magnet Mastery phone ritual**, a 30-second task involving affirmations and visualization.

It’s light on theory but heavy on practice. You’ll find **ways to attract money through mindset** that are simple, consistent, and more engaging than yet another podcast episode about passive income.

This approach feels especially appealing if you're tired of products that require 40 hours of your life to tell you what could’ve fit on a sticky note.

# 🔄 How It Works

Each day, you open the program, follow a few prompts, and practice **a quick daily money ritual that actually works**—all in under a minute.

The main goal is to **rewire your brain to attract wealth** by disrupting thought patterns that tell you you're destined to struggle.

You’re not forced into deep journaling sessions or seminars. Instead, it uses **techniques for manifesting wealth** by combining focus, breath, and [repeated intention](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/money-magnet-mastery-official).

The phone becomes your ritual tool. Yes, the same device you usually use to scroll cat memes is now part of your **training that builds wealth consciousness**.

Even if you don’t believe in **using the law of attraction to gain money**, this micro-practice helps you pause long enough to act with more intention.

There’s also subtle guidance on how to **reprogram your subconscious mind for wealth** through repetition—not by overhauling your life, but by changing small daily patterns.

# 👥 Who It’s For

If you're looking to **break free from a scarcity mindset**, this course was made for you. It works well for freelancers, creators, and side-hustlers with money anxiety.

It’s ideal for people trying to **transform their money mindset** without adding extra chaos to their schedules. You can literally do the ritual before your coffee finishes brewing.

The tone is practical, not preachy. If you’ve rolled your eyes at “abundance vibes” in the past, don’t worry—it keeps things grounded, while still helping you shift how you think.

# 📱 My Personal Experience (from Robyn)

A friend of mine, **Robyn**, is a freelance illustrator I met years ago through a creative entrepreneurship group.

She’s one of those people who can make a client’s rough napkin sketch look like it belongs in a gallery—but she’s always joked that her money habits “belong in a dumpster fire.”

Robyn was the first to tell me about [Money Magnet Mastery](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/money-magnet-mastery-official). She’d hit a wall after a slow quarter, spiraling into self-doubt and what she called her “I’m broke so I must be broken” loop.

After hearing about this 30-second ritual that was supposed to rewire your money mindset, she figured, “Why not?”

She started doing the ritual every morning before opening her tablet to sketch.

She’d sit for a moment, repeat the guided phrase, and take a few deep breaths while visualizing a day where she wasn’t in panic mode about rent.

Within two weeks, she said she felt a genuine shift—subtle, but powerful. She was quoting jobs with more confidence, saying no to flaky clients, and even applying for grants she’d normally talk herself out of.

Her one gripe? She mentioned the content could’ve offered a bit more variation or maybe an optional audio format.

“It’s not a podcast—I get that—but I’d love to hear someone walk me through it now and then,” she told me.

Still, Robyn said it was one of the only tools that helped her break that cycle of **negative thought patterns around money**—without requiring hours of her already limited time.

And knowing how many online courses she’s rage-quit mid-module, that’s saying something.

1pw487j,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1pw487j/if_you_do_breaks_when_do_you_take_them/,"If you do breaks, when do you take them?","Started Vyvanse in September, and for the most part I haven’t taken much breaks. Maybe 3 times max. Unfortunately I am having trouble with communication with my psychiatrist, and have had to do a lot of my own research. 


I’m still working out what suits me, and breaks are something I am learning about. 


I know some people take breaks, regularly, and some people never do. At times the meds didn’t hit as hard, I questioned a tolerance break, but I noticed that looking after myself (diet, exercise, sleep, stress) managed to help the meds work efficiently. 


Ironically when I started meds, It was, and still is in a time where I have less to do. I wish I had them when I was burnt out with an endless to do list. When I have stuff to do, they really help me, but sometimes I wonder are they necessary on days where I’m just sitting around? 

 I want the meds to be a part of my life, but I don’t want to feel like I cant function without them. 


In my little experience of days off here’s what I’ve noticed: 

* Harder to get going

* A reliance on caffeine (I had smash coffee all day off meds, but on meds one is enough) 

* Brain fog, groggy feeling

* Maybe a once off, but I had a headache one day I skipped a dose 



I’m definitely better on meds, but I’d hate to think if I traveled to a country where I can’t take them that I would feel foggy and tired. 


Anyways, there are days where I feel like It’s okay with no meds. I don’t mind being tired and a couch potato if It’s a day (like today, the after Christmas). I question using them if I genuinely need rest. 


It’s all trial and error for me right now, but what works for you guys? ",4,1766755499.0,VyvanseADHD,1,1.0,False

Coffee, juice, light breakfast watching and hearing the crash of the waves. Go down to the docks and go on a short boat ride to the perfect spot to dive. Spend some time looking at the amazing colors and life that the ocean provides us. After a couple of dives come back to a nice tropical local lunch. Then relax in the sun with a nap. Then show off my massage skills with the ocean view and sounds to stay in a peaceful place. I’m rubbing my hands all over that amazing body from head to toe. Once I feel the body tingle I slowly work my way back up. When I get to the thighs and butt I make sure they are getting extra attention when massaging the inner thigh,slowly brushing against the outer part of the lips. Once I feel the slight squirm under my touch, I brush the lips again. I do this until I can hear slight moans coming from under your breathe. I then slight massage and spread the lips so I can rub the clit as I rub up and down your lips. That’s when you spread you legs open a little more to give better access to your now exposed hard clit. I roll you onto your back so I can slowly massage and your lips and clit with one hand and your breast with the other. Every now and then insert a little a my finger inside to tease you and make you squirm even more. You then spread your legs open even wider give me full access to now spread open lips. I slip a finger all the way inside and then you let out a loud gasp when it slide across your g-spot!! I slowly start sliding my finger in and out then slide a 2nd finger in. While massaging your breast swapping back and forth not to neglect the other. I pinch and tease your nipples while I’m still stroking in and out of your pussy. I’m steadily rubbing your g-spot making you squirm and moan louder and louder. Until you EXPLODE on my hand. I lean down for a soft kiss and ask would you like to continue this in the bedroom. After an hour or so of teasing and pleasing in the bedroom. Curl up and snuggle until we get our energy back. Eat a nice local supper and then curl up and watch the sunset. As the sun lowers we might miss a little bit of it with the soft kisses between us. That’s when we make it back to the room for some more tease and pleasing of you!!

​When I saw the staff demo the machine at the store, they used a large paper cup and it filled all the way up with just one pod.

​I’m confused because I’m not using the smallest pods (which I know are for short shots).

- Did I do something wrong?
- ​Can I reuse the same pod to get more coffee?
- ​Should I be pressing the button more than once?

​Any help would be appreciated!

Minsan naiisip ko pa din tong nangyari kahit it happened 2 months ago na. Umuwi ako ng pinas after 5 years kasama ang asawa ko na first time lang nila mamemeet kasi sa abroad kami kinasal and nakatira. Anyway alam ko naman na tumaba ako ng bonga like I gained 10 kgs in the past 5 years mainly due to my health issues, I even had to get surgery pa and I also suffered from anxiety and depression kaya i  had to take antidepressants that worsened the weight gain and my metabolism got super slow. Bago ako umuwi kinondisyon ko yung sarili ko na alam ko na madaming babati sakin ng ""ang taba taba mo na!"" kasi lahat ng kapamilya at kaibigan ko kahit mga non-related titas ko mahilig talaga magcomment kahit ng mas payat pa ako dati. Ayun when we got home, the first thing people said to me was of course that I gained weight. it was like the salubong greeting sa akin almost everywhere to the point na parang ayoko na talagang makipag meet kahit kanino sa totoo lang but anyway, sige lang hayaan na, ganun talaga. 

Then, I had dinner with my aunt and her husband... Kaming apat bale me and my husband and her and her husband. Okay naman ang dinner pero kasi sa totoo lang hindi ko talaga close ang husband niya because while I was growing up, sa ibang lugar sila nakatira and my family doesn't have a good relationship with this guy for certain reasons. I have only met him 3 times in my whole life; once in college when we stayed at their place for 2 nights but hindi kami nag uusap, second was nag cafe kami kasama ng pinsan ko from abroad for about an hour where he mostly just ignored me and only focused on my balikbayan cousin, and ito yung pang third. Medyo awkward talaga ang dinner atleast for me pero I tried din naman for my tita kasi ang bait nang tita ko na ito and she helps me a lot sa mga needs ko. She is super kind and may pagka open minded and liberal din kasi siya unlike my super conservative dad. Ayun habang nag uusap kami, yung asawa niya sabi ba naman sakin bigla,

""Wow, you got so big. you were half of your body when I last saw you."" Nasaktan ako ng sobra pero hinayaan ko lang. 

Nagsabi nalang ako na parang joke na, ""hindi naman grabe ka tito."" 

""No, seriously, not even half but 1/3.""

Bigla niyang kinausap yung asawa ko at sabi,

""Was she that big when you married her?""

Grabe sa lahat ng pang bobody shame sakin the whole time na nanduon ako dun ako pinaka nasaktan na you are not just rubbing it in my face, worse pa is you are shamelessly pressuring my husband to insult me as well?

Yung asawa ko na awkwardan, hindi niya alam ano isasagot niya kaya tumawa siya and ako tumawa na din pero alam mo yung nervous laughter? Ganun and pinepray ko na sana tumigil na siya. Also FYI, I met my husband when I was super fit and that was before ako nagkasakit. I don't think it would have mattered but just for context.

Sabi ng asawa ko sa kanya, ""She's my wife. I love her and she is beautiful."" Yung husband ko ayaw na din na nalagay siya on the spot. I told him ""good answer,"" and we just awkwardly smiled after that hoping na change topic na.

Dumagdag pa siya,

""You really like her? You like her body like that? That's your type?"" he said it pa sa asawa ko like 2 times na parang he was really egging him to admit it. Ayaw tumigil at yung asawa ko naman napa what??? For context, I am almost 5'3'' and 66kgs now but pre surgery and anxiety meds, I was about 55kgs. 

Dumagdag pa na, ""I told [my aunt's name] she can't get fat. No way!"" Sabay tawa niya at ang tita ko naman walang reaction tahimik lang.

Gusto ko manuntok ng time na yun kasi alam mo ba, kung makapag insulto sa akin parang feeling Brad Pitt siya na para bang hindi si Shrek yung kawangis ni sir, ayaw ko nalang mag talk pero eversince yung family namin hindi alam ano ang nagustuhan ng tita ko sa kanya. Maraming kwento kasi bakit na I don't want to discuss here because I respect my aunt pero kahit mismong tita ko tumawa lang and hindi niya ako maipagtanggol or maawat man lang or mapagsabihan ang bastos niyang asawa. 

The whole evening ang dami niyang snide remarks like bigla niyang sasabihin,

""Yeah, [my name], [ my dad's name]'s very biiiiiiig daughter!"" Ang sakit na ng dibidib ko kasi naiiyak ako deep inside. Looking back sana nag walk out nalang ako that time or sinagot ko siya ng pabalang na siya nga sa mukha niyang iyan nagkagusto pa sa kanya tita ko but I didn't, alang alang sa tita ko and ayaw ko siya ipahiya and ayaw ko na rin ng gulo. Pero tangina ang sakit. Palaban din ako and nakikipag away ako if alam kong tama ako pero ewan ko ba that time parang hindi ako maka react.

After while, biglang binalik niya na naman ang convo sa weight ko and since my husband and I were already getting visibly uncomfortable that time, nagpasimple siya na, ""Okay let's not call her fat, let's just say she is robust.""

I swear this is not an AI rage bait post or whatever, it really happened and until now hindi ako makapaniwala na may tao palang ganun ka bastos in real life. 

When we got home I talked to my husband and I cried, sabi niya sakin nagulat din daw siya and hindi siya makapag react and he apologized and said he should have stood up for me more and shut him down when I was being insulted in my face. He told me that if it happened in his country, he will get kicked in the balls if he even as much as commented on a woman's body pero yung mga comments niya sa akin baka dawa mabaril siya dun haha. He was also pretty shocked since first meeting and all plus he didn't want to start any arguments with my family and want to make a good impression sa kanila.

I messaged my aunt pagkadating namin ng hotel telling her that I appreciated the dinner invitation (kami pala ni hubby ang nagbayad ng dinner because gusto namin sila i-treat) but that I got really hurt by her husband's remarks. 

Sinagot lang ako na ""Sorry for his tacky comment alam mo naman, mga matatanda na kung ano ano sinasabi. parang yung lola mo lang minsan."" Excuse me he is not even that old and he is just fine, but my lola brought me up and was there while I was growing up, it's not the same getting this comment from a person I barely even know, does not really have any kind of relationship with me and basically a stranger to me, like what right does he have to talk to me that way? Close ba tayo for you to make backhanded jokes about my weight like that? Parang wala lang sa tita ko na parang hindi nga genuine apology tapos ininvite pa kami ulit mag coffee daw bago bumalik abroad na parang wala lang. Ganun lang pala seguro para sa kanya yun no big deal and hindi niya naintindahan gaano kasakit ang mga salitang binitawan ng asawa niya. 

Ayun, I forgave them in my heart after that short convo with my aunt, we never talked about it again. Hindi ko na pinalaki and I haven't even told my dad or anyone else in my family about it.  But aminado ako na sobrang nasasaktan pa din ako... and my self esteem plummeted to the deepest trenches possible since then. 

I had my hair done and have been wearing it down for awhile and I get a lot of complements recently that I look good sa hair ko and that somehow made me feel good about myself. Pero masakit pa din pala noh? Until now naiisip ko pa din as in fresh sa isip ko lahat ng sinabi niya. I still talk to my aunt and I don't wanna be mad at her for her husband's wrongdoing sa akin. I just wish I could have stood up for myself at that time. Isa seguro yun sa multo ko... Yung lang talaga.",4,1766754888.0,OffMyChestPH,4,0.83,False

I’m not looking for anything super high-end — just a stylish, comfortable, and durable set that’s great for relaxing, entertaining, or enjoying my morning coffee outside.

I’ve seen some really cute and affordable options, but I’m curious about the quality, comfort, and how well they hold up over time (especially in different weather conditions).

Ideally, I’m looking for a set that’s:

* Comfortable with supportive cushions
* Weather-resistant and low-maintenance
* Easy to assemble and move around
* Stylish enough to elevate a patio or deck
* Affordable without feeling flimsy

Here are a few sets I’ve been considering:

* **Better Homes & Gardens Clayton Court 4-Piece Patio Conversation Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Brookbury 5-Piece Outdoor Dining Set**
* **BH&G Ravenbrooke Wicker Sectional Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Camrose Farmhouse Outdoor Bench**
* **BH&G Hawthorne Park Bistro Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage Steel Conversation Set**
* **BH&G Ventura Stationary Rocking Chairs Set**

If you’ve purchased any of these or have experience with **Better Homes & Gardens patio furniture** in general, I’d love to know how it’s held up for you — especially over time or in rain/sun-heavy areas. Also open to tips on cushions, storage, and whether it's worth buying the furniture covers or extra accessories.

1pw3txz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pw3txz/car_from_the_depthsprologue/,Car From the Depths-Prologue,"Hello my fellow Readers/Writers. This is my first published story on this brand new subreddit and I wanted to put out a banger of a lead in to get ya hooked on the first part after the 24 hours so I wrote this little prologue last night and I hope you enjoy the appetizer cause the main course is tomorrow. 





The old house, with a cracked wooden foundation, stood firm with the October wind. I could smell the chipped, iron paint with the wind blowing the smell to me and most of the neighborhood. I can see people on their porches in rocking chairs, plugging their noses from that metallic smell. I kept my composure, walked up to that front porch–the wood creaking under my feet–and I knocked on the front door.

 I didn’t tap on the door hard, but it felt like it was about to fall from my knocking. I waited a couple of minutes for any response, but there was only silence. I pressed my ear to the door to listen in, hoping to hear something, but there was nothing on the other side. I leaned back and stepped over to one of the windows on the left side. 

It was dusty and cracked to hell, maybe because of that or maybe just because of the distance, but the house didn’t seem to have any lights on, so I couldn’t see inside. My focus was on the window, so when the door flung open, I nearly jumped out of my skin. 

I was standing there for a couple of moments, feeling my heart that was beating so fast it felt like it was going to burst. From the darkness, I saw an old man walk out. The first thing I noticed, the first thing that the sun shone on, was his dilapidated clothes. He was wearing a plain white shirt with brown, greasy stains across it, worn and torn kakhees that seemed to be from a forgotten age of time, and his black military boots that were torn to the point they looked like sandals at first glance. The gray beard on his chin and the dozens of wrinkles made him look the part of an old man. 

The smile he wore on his face was a crazy person’s smile; it made me rethink my decision to come here. My legs began to shake, yes, because of fear, but it wasn’t because I was stuck in place; rather, I wanted to run. I wanted to sprint off the porch and to my car, but I was thinking that if I ran, the porch would collapse under my weight, and I would be stuck there worse than I already was. 

“Can I help you?” He said in the raspy voice of a smoker. His blue eyes shifted from mine to some papers I had in my arms. “You a reporter?” I couldn’t speak a word; I was terrified of this man. “What’s the matter, son, you a mute?” 

“N-no, sir.” 

“Sir? I haven’t been called that in a long while.” He stretched his hand out, “Mr. Groggins is fine with me.” I shook his hand with hesitation, but I shook it all the same.

“I’m Daniel.” He chuckled at my name.

“My father was named Daniel.” I forced a smile, “Yeah, he was a mean asshole.” Both of our smiles faded instantly. “Oh, don’t worry, he’s been dead for fifty years.” His eyes moved to the floor. “Don’t miss ‘im much.” His smile returned, but mine didn’t. “It gets a bit lonely around here with no one to visit.” His eyes focused back on me. “Where are my manners, please”, he shifted his arm to the open door. I could hear his bones creaking, “Come on inside, I’ll put on some coffee.” 

My legs calmed down a bit, and I was able to use them under my own power again. I walked over to the door, passing by the old man. I got a close look at him, his wrinkly skin and lips still curled in a smile, but his eyes told a different story. They told one of empathy and grief. 

I walked into the home, hearing the porch floorboard creaking behind me as the door shut. 

	Being inside the home didn’t ease my worries. There were lots of odd and discomforting things around the place that made it seem like it was the home of a maniac. A couple of taxidermied animals, old photos covered in dust, a food bowl for a dog destroyed by mold, and the smell of the home smelled like actual shit. Hints of wet carpet fluctuated my nose when we entered the living room, but that shit smell overpowered all others. 

	The living room itself was horrible. Clothes, spiderwebs, and cockroaches climbing the walls made my stomach hurt something awful. He sat down on one of the wooden chairs. For a moment, I thought he was going to fall through the chair with how fast he was descending, but the chair held still. Mr. Groggins wasn’t small; he looked to be 6’2 with a couple of hundred pounds on him, and sagging skin on his arms where muscles used to be.

	He pointed at the chair across the room with a wrinkly finger. “Grab that chair, son.”

	I did as he asked and set my papers down on a cracked table he was sitting next to. I lifted the chair, expecting it to be light; it was a rocking chair after all, but I nearly sprained my back. I was able to move the chair to the spot next to the table, and it wasn’t easy. My legs and arms were really sore after the effort, but I managed, then I sat next to Mr. Groggins who was smirking.

	“Had a little trouble?” He said and I didn’t have a retort. “Wasn’t expecting something so heavy?” I couldn’t help but snicker a bit; it was so ridiculous. 

	“Yeah, sorry, but I really wasn’t. Rocking chairs aren’t usually so heavy.”

	“No, not all the time, but I’ve had that chair for a better part of thirty years. When I was that young, I could lift a lot of things. Nowadays, not so much.” 

	All of a sudden, I felt bad for the old man. Here I was scared of him this entire time and now I feel bad. Was it for him or for me being so scared? I don’t know. 

	Mr. Groggins started rocking back and forth in his chair in silence. I grabbed the papers I had held earlier and put them in front of Mr. Groggins. He stopped rocking instantly. His face grew angry and shocked. “Where did you get that?” He asked. He pointed at a picture of a car. 

	“You recognize it?” I asked him, and he looked at me with cold, angry eyes. 

	“A man never forgets his first car.” He said. I leaned back in the chair and started rocking myself. It’s been about ten years since I’ve actually been on a chair like that but the familiarity hit me instantly. I started to daydream a bit, a sort of flash from the past in my mind. It was a day I had spent with my grandfather. My dad used to take us over to his home all the time, but there was one day in particular that stuck out in my brain. 

	I was five, maybe six, and I was with my grandfather on his lap, with him rocking back and forth in the rocking chair. I don’t remember all the words he said. I wasn’t paying attention to his words, but to the rocking of the chair. That same rocking is what I’m feeling now. Same cadence to the way it moved. It was insane, but it really was the same. 

	“I’m supposin'’’, he started to say, snapping me out of my daydream like a thief snatching jewels, “With that photo you brought, you’ve come to ask me questions ‘bout that car, didn’t ya?” I nodded and he sighed mournfully. “Alright, I don’t mind, if it will help ya somehow, then I can tell ya what happened forty years ago. When I got my first car.” He leaned back into his chair and reached over it to grab something. It was a photo; it wasn’t covered in dust like the other things he had.

	“What is that?” I asked, my curious nature getting the better of me. 

	“This?” He turned the thing over to reveal a photo of a car. A black mustang with a red stripe down the middle, Mr. Groggins sitting on the hood with his arms folded, and a woman standing next to him. 

	“Who’s she?” I asked him.

	“Her name was Delilah, prettiest damn girl I ever saw. I fell in love the moment I saw her.” His eyes started to tear up, but he wiped them away quickly. “The car you see, it’s the same car in that photo you showed me.” I suspected as much when I researched the previous owners of the car; the only living one was Mr. Groggins.

	“How is that possible?”

	“That car ain’t normal.” He answered, “And it’s all because of me.” 

	“You?”

	“Yeah, son. Me.” He set the photo down on the table and purposefully turned it towards me. “Shall we get started?” 

	I nodded and pulled out my phone and laid it next to the photo, hitting the record button. “So, Mr. Groggins, can you start from the beginning?” He looked into my eyes with deep hatred, but not for me, for something else. 

“If I had known from the jumpstart how bad things were going to be”, Mr. Groggins said,  “I would never have fixed that car. I know you come from a long ways away and this story is long and horrific, but I hope you take some time out of your investigatin’ to listen. These might seem like the ramblings of a kooky old man but just know, everything that comes from my lips is true. It haunts me to this day, and I still don’t know how I ever thought it was a good idea. I guess the best place to start, the only place to start, is from my senior year of high school, August 17th, 1983.”

1pw3ta2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1pw3ta2/trip_report_a_trip_to_le_brassus/,[Trip Report] A Trip to Le Brassus,"Nestled between the mountains, above the fog, and through the winding roads you arrive at the heart of watchmaking in the Valle de Joux. Just a little over a hundred years ago, watchmakers from the region would take this journey, by foot, returning from Geneva after selling their wares and engaging in trade. Making this journey yourself, albeit a much-expedited version, I truly believe to be important for any connoisseur of horology. The village of Le Brassus is quiet hideaway above the clouds, the very forefront of horological innovation is juxtaposed against the livestock that share the valley. The ties to tradition are strong as watchmakers assembling Grand Complications overlook the same fields that Jules Audemars and Edward Piguet had over 150 years ago today.  

\[Valley\](https://i.imgur.com/vCASzFY.jpeg)

I had the pleasure of staying at the Hôtel des Horlogers whose history dates to 1857 as the Hotel de France until in 2003 Audemars Piguet took over ownership and radically transforming the hotel into an art piece in itself. When you arrive at your room you are greeted with a small gift basket containing a water bottle, a vial of salt with flavors of fir trees from the valley, a bit of garlic bread, and some tea. 

\[Hotel Gift\](https://i.imgur.com/6ZBNLq0.jpeg)

The room was beautiful with panoramic sweeping views of the valley for all rooms in the hotel. I highly recommend the restaurant Brasserie Le Gogant where Emmanual Renaut has put together a wonderful menu of local mountain flavors that capture the essence of the village.The hotel has so many charms and quirks. Pretty much everything in the hotel is for sale, on the floors to your room there’s a few items posted for sale such as clothing, jewelry, perfumes, random bits of art etc. It’s kind of like a mall… I had even asked the front desk if even the little bobbles that decorate the front desk were available for purchase and to my surprise they were. 

\[It's kind of LIKE a mall...\](https://i.imgur.com/0unsCVR.png)

For the day of the tour, you have two options of getting to the Musse Atelier. There’s the direct route that allows you to walk next-door directly to the museum, or the more interesting route involving a small detour behind the hotel. Along this path you will see art commissioned by AP contemporary including a triceratops skull cast in bronze and a white rabbit statue as well as really taking in the views of the valley. This route also allows you to get a good view of the glass framed building and its spiral design with grass covered roofs. 

\[White Rabbit\](https://i.imgur.com/07HGKKn.jpeg)

When you arrive for your tour, you are greeted in an intimate room where you sit and take in the atmosphere of where it all began. You are offered coffee and tea as well as small treats while your tour guide goes over the building and its history. What follows is a journey through time from the discovery of iron in the region to the families establishing themselves here and the journey AP took from creating highly complicated movements to becoming the leader of horological innovation in the modern era. 

\[Sign\](https://i.imgur.com/oPhZ8WL.jpeg)        

As part of the tour you get to try your hand at some watchmaking techniques including applying perlage to a brass royal oak shaped bezel as well as applying a brushed finish to the front leaving with you a nice little trinket for your trip. If you want to do more watchmaking they offer workshops; however, I unfortunately didn’t have a chance to go to any of the watchmaking workshops, but I heard they’re a great experience and have been recommended by many. 

\[Perlage\](https://i.imgur.com/KslL3Mv.jpeg)

\[Bezel\](https://i.imgur.com/eI9JuNX.jpeg)

The tour concludes with a special 150th anniversary room where you can see some interesting designs from the archives and watch some short vintage films from AP through the years describing their watchmaking, there’s also a photobooth where you can take pictures. Finally, there’s a wishing tree where you can write a wish and attach it to a tree. I of course wished for the RD #6 although I am still excited for the more standard complications to come out in the wake of the RD line finishing haha.

\[Wishing Tree\](https://i.imgur.com/bfx3TGa.jpeg)

There is a small gift shop at the end of the tour where you can buy a museum program and a selection of AP publications, a couple of which hard to find now as they’ve been out of print as far as I can tell. There’s also some notebooks and chocolate :)

\[AP Chocolate!\](https://i.imgur.com/znPs4On.jpeg)

After embarking on this journey my appreciation for AP has only grown. There's a deep personal connection with AP that most brands can't seem capture. When you wear an AP you feel a tie to the valley, the watchmakers, the families, the history, everything. As an AP customer you are a patron of the contemporary arts, and a supporter of traditional watchmaking that pushes the bounds of what is possible in the the field. 

I highly recommend anyone curious as to why AP is AP to take a visit to Le Brassus and check it out for themselves.",2,1766754230.0,Watches,0,1.0,False

1pw3piz,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1pw3piz/stop_saying_seoul_has_no_soul_after_visiting_only/,Stop saying Seoul has “no soul” after visiting only Myeongdong and Gangnam,"I’ve been lurking on Reddit for a while, and every time I see someone post “Seoul felt soulless” or “I couldn’t find authentic Korea,” I check their itinerary and it’s always the same: Myeongdong → Gangnam COEX → Gyeongbokgung → Hongdae → maybe Bukchon if they’re feeling adventurous.

Look, there’s nothing wrong with visiting these places. They’re popular for a reason. But complaining about Seoul lacking character after only hitting the tourist megaspots is like visiting Times Square and declaring NYC has no personality.

As a Seoul local, here’s my honest take:

\-----

Places you’re probably skipping (but shouldn’t)

Hyehwa-dong (혜화) — University neighborhood with actual character. Small theaters, indie cafes, and streets that feel alive without feeling like a shopping mall.

Changdeokgung & Changgyeonggung instead of Gyeongbokgung — Don’t get me wrong, Gyeongbokgung is THE main palace of Joseon. But here’s the thing: after Imjin War destroyed all palaces in 1592, Changdeokgung served as the actual royal residence for over 270 years until 1867. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Secret Garden (Huwon) is genuinely beautiful. Yet somehow everyone only goes to Gyeongbokgung.

Naksan Park (낙산공원) — City wall views, old neighborhood vibes, zero crowds compared to Namsan.

Jamsil instead of Gangnam — If you want the “modern Seoul” experience, Jamsil delivers better. Lotte World Tower observation deck, Seokchon Lake, actual things to do beyond luxury shopping.

SKIP Gwangjang Market. Go to Mangwon or Namdaemun Markets instead. — Gwangjang has become a tourist trap with inflated prices and staged “authentic” experiences. Mangwon Market is where actual Seoulites shop. Namdaemun is chaotic but real.

Jongmyo Shrine (종묘) — The royal ancestral shrine. Genuinely solemn and beautiful. Somehow less visited than it deserves.

Cheonggyecheon (청계천) — Yes it’s touristy near Gwanghwamun, but walk further down. It gets peaceful fast.

Eunpyeong Hanok Village (은평한옥마을) — Modern hanok neighborhood without the Bukchon crowds.

Namsangol Hanok Village — Free, quiet, and you can actually take photos without 50 people in the frame.

\-----

“Peaceful vibes” are everywhere if you look

People ask “where can I escape the crowds?” as if Seoul is just one giant shopping district. The peaceful atmosphere exists literally everywhere outside the main tourist zones:

Changsin-dong — Old hillside neighborhood, incredible city views

Haebangchon — Expat-friendly but still has local character

Seongbuk-dong — Quiet residential area with traditional houses

Mullae-dong — Industrial area turned arts district

Yeouido — The riverside parks are genuinely peaceful

Yangjae — Citizen’s Forest is massive and empty

Seoul is a megacity of 10 million people. There are THOUSANDS of neighborhoods beyond the 5 spots that show up on every “48 hours in Seoul” blog post.

\-----

A note on walking distances

I see so many itineraries that go:

Day 1: Gyeongbokgung

Day 2: Deoksugung

Day 3: Changdeokgung

These palaces are 15-20 minutes apart on foot. You could literally do Gyeongbokgung → Deoksugung in one morning with a coffee break in between. Gyeongbokgung to Changdeokgung is about 20 minutes walking.

Seoul is incredibly walkable. Public transport is excellent, but the central areas (Jongno, Jung-gu) are very compact. You don’t need to dedicate separate days for places that are basically neighbors.

\-----

Places that ARE worth the hype (from a local)

Not everything popular is overrated:

Namsan Tower — Skip the observation deck (overpriced), but the walk up and the locks are genuinely nice.

Seongsu-dong — Yes it’s trendy, but the cafe scene and converted warehouse shops are legitimately good.

Gyeongbokgung — Despite what I said, it’s still THE main palace of Joseon Dynasty. Worth seeing once.

Echon area — National Museum of Korea (free, world-class collection from ancient Korea) and War Memorial (covers Korean modern history including the Korean War). Both are excellent and often overlooked.

\-----

TL;DR

Seoul has plenty of soul. You just have to walk 10 minutes away from where everyone else is walking.",93,1766753912.0,koreatravel,12,0.96,False
1pw3p3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constructedadventures/comments/1pw3p3a/the_golden_scarab_and_the_sands_of_fate_this/,THE GOLDEN SCARAB AND THE SANDS OF FATE. This year’s Christmas adventure.,"Happy holidays everyone.

This is a long post. Grab some patience.  
The original text is in Spanish and is [fully available on my blog, ](https://www.crisolstudio.com/post/el-escarabajo-dorado-y-las-arenas-del-destino)with more photos and videos for all puzzles. For this post, I’ve used a ChatGPT translation because my brain just can’t handle thinking in English right now. Still recovering from these days.

I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.

Here we go:

A new time-travel adventure for our fearless explorers. This time, nothing less than Ancient Egypt, where the sun burns, the sands whisper, and the gods watch from above.

The players’ mission is to find the Golden Scarab, the sacred amulet that will allow them to return home.

As always, all the props and puzzles were made by me from scratch, using a *lot* of cardboard and acrylic paint.

For the first time in our family, the game took place in our new house, which made decoration and logistics a bit easier.

This time we had 13 players, and to keep things simple, ALL the puzzles were set up on the table, except for the sarcophagus and the fan, which were standing. That way, nobody had to wander around the house and everyone could participate in all the puzzles.

On the table, we had a “desert” sandbox with buried objects and others in plain sight, archaeologist tools, lots of boxes and objects spread across the table, a huge labyrinth with a hole in the middle, and at one end, a golden pyramid with a top engraved with the Ankh symbol.

https://preview.redd.it/fv1z0aq1lj9g1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=560faf7ce0c30ad4dd8a6a1e887ce51388bbd2c4

There are 4 paths in the game, which merge into 3 to open the lock of the final pyramid. I’ll explain each path in detail below, hoping it’s useful and gives you ideas for your own adventures.

**PATHS 1 and 2**

The first thing that catches your eye is a huge sarcophagus with a lock and a scroll, and next to it, a feather fan.

https://preview.redd.it/5f8ny8z9lj9g1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65b7567541658b65fa44eeab417ab005aff1901f

The scroll says:  
“The words of the Pharaoh lie asleep under the cold of time. Only the fire of Ra can give them back their voice. Bring his flame closer with respect and the secret of the sarcophagus shall be revealed.”

Below the text, there are numbers written. On the table, there’s a candle with a lid labeled “Fire of Ra.” They must light the candle and pass the flame over the numbers. Some are written with Frixion pen, so when heated, they disappear, leaving only the numbers written in permanent ink. Those numbers open the sarcophagus lock.

Inside the sarcophagus is an unusual mummy, with googly eyes, along with part of the Staff of Ra and a canopic jar containing a UV flashlight. On the lid, there are drawings of four other canopic jars. 

https://reddit.com/link/1pw3p3a/video/q5giiclemj9g1/player

One of them has text written in invisible ink.

The text says:  
“Only the sacred waters of the great Nile will reveal what mortal eyes cannot see. Purify with water the jar of Anubis’ pearls and let the truth rise from its depths. What you discover will open the black box marked with the Pharaoh’s face.”

On the table, there’s a glass filled with hydrated Orbeez pearls, which hide what’s written at the bottom. There’s also a bottle locked and labeled “Water of the Nile.” They must figure out how to open it and pour the water into the glass, revealing the number at the bottom, which opens the black box with the Pharaoh’s image.

https://reddit.com/link/1pw3p3a/video/j2ywhgvopj9g1/player

Wrapped around the head of the Staff of Ra is a ribbon with text. It’s a scytale. They must wrap the ribbon around the staff to reveal the message. However, the staff isn’t long enough to reveal the full text.

In the “desert,” there’s another piece of the staff marked with the number 2, and another one hidden in the handle of the fan, marked with the number 3. Once the staff is complete and the ribbon is wrapped, the text can be read, revealing the code to open the Water of the Nile bottle:

“At the third sun, 9 moons and 4 shadows, the Nile will overflow. Do not spill its water. The Pharaoh will claim it.”

At this point, both paths merge into one, continuing with the black box.

Inside the box, there’s a metal token that opens a magnetic lock on a wooden box with this text:  
“Oh, desert traveler, seek neither metal nor key. Invoke the energy that attracts iron, and the sacred seal shall rise.”

Inside the box is a letter maze. The correct path reveals the code to open a wooden chest.

Inside the chest are 9 clay sticks and a note explaining that they are part of the final code to open the pyramid.



**PATH 3**

On the table, there’s a giant labyrinth with 3 balls and a hole in the middle. The text says they must work as a team to extract 4 balls to open a box with Egyptian symbols. But there are only 3 balls in the labyrinth.

https://reddit.com/link/1pw3p3a/video/fq8jwgmzmj9g1/player

The fourth ball is inside a white wooden box with a lock… but no key. So where is the key?

On the table, there’s also a desert sandbox with buried items (some useless), several columns, and a pyramid made of kinetic sand mixed with glue and plaster so it stays firm but can be broken easily.

Inside the pyramid is the key to the box. But to dig in the sandbox, they may only use the provided tools: a hammer, a shovel, a brush, tweezers, and a chisel. Hands are strictly forbidden.

“Do not touch the sacred sand with your hands. Only the proper tools will reveal the desert’s secret.”

https://reddit.com/link/1pw3p3a/video/3grmcxbanj9g1/player

Once they find the key and open the box, they get the fourth ball. By combining the symbols inside the four balls, they open the codex box.

Inside is a crossword puzzle that reveals the code to open a beautiful cryptex, a gift from an architect friend of mine.

Inside the cryptex is a text written in mirrored and vertically flipped letters, using a hard-to-read font. It reveals the numbers needed to open a round black box.

Inside that box, written in hieroglyphs, is the number 300, along with a note saying it’s one of the three digits needed to open the pyramid.

**PATH 4**

On the table, there’s a trapezoidal object with a stick topped with a Pharaoh’s head and a number. In the sandbox and hidden in another object on the table are four more sticks of different lengths, also with Pharaoh heads and numbers.

In one of the books on the table, locked with a padlock, it says that to open it, all the Pharaoh heads must be placed at the same height (Neither can look over the other). Once aligned, the correct code is revealed to open the book.

https://preview.redd.it/ury8fcognj9g1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7489889bf21cc696776c4d5f9b4679e8d00f3b0c

Inside the book is a text in hieroglyphs. To decode it, they must find a cipher wheel (Caesar cipher). The key for the wheel is hidden behind the Rosetta Stone replica on the table.

The decoded text opens a notebook with a hieroglyph-covered cover. Inside is a deck of cards with Egyptian gods, each with a number and a characteristic. By decoding the text, they find the code to open the Chest of Anubis.

Inside is a cartouche with the number 50 written in Egyptian numerals, and a note saying it’s one of the final three digits.

On the table, there’s also an object explaining the numeric value of hieroglyphs, helping them discover that the final three digits are 300+50+9 (359).

They can now open the lock on the pyramid. But inside, they find a cage with a remote inside, and a papyrus with a woven warp covering the code needed to open the cage. They must undo the weaving to reveal the code.

Once the cage is open, they can use the remote to open the door inside the pyramid… which finally hides the Golden Scarab.

And that’s it. A full year of work, done little by little between a lot of family events we had in 2025.

**Some stats:**  
Duration: 1h 15min. or so

What they liked the most: The new format of having everything at hand on the table. So everyone has participated and seen all the puzzles, while we continued with the drinks.

What I liked the most: Making the sarcophagus was crazy. It has been sitting on the living room table for months until I have finished it. But it's been fun and it's been worth it.

The puzzle they liked the most: Digging, without a doubt. Like small children

Comparison with previous years. It has been less chaotic, with more collaborative games

Things to improve: Well, they have not objected to anything. It has been great.

Every year before dinner, we put a small gift at each place at the table. Mine are always related to the game theme. Since this year was Ancient Egypt, the women received a Cleopatra kohl eyeliner in an Egyptian-style makeup bag. The men got a jar of dukkah, a traditional Egyptian spice mix. The youngest in the family got a mummy duck and an Anubis duck for his collection. And grandpa got an Egyptian-themed coffee mug.

Next year’s theme: Japan. I need to get some value out of everything I brought back from our trip to the Land of the Rising Sun.

Any ideas for puzzles, besides Japanese puzzle boxes?

I’m looking for advice about my kalanchoe.
Some leaves are turning red and feel very soft. I water it only when the soil looks dry, about every 10 days, with around 50–60 ml of water (one small coffee cup).
The weather is quite cold where I live: daytime temperatures are around 8–15°C depending on sun. When it’s sunny, I put it in direct sunlight. At night, I bring it indoors because temperatures can drop to 2°C with frost.
I also noticed baby kalanchoes growing in the soil.
Should I leave them there for now, or separate and plant them in their own pots?
Is this normal cold/sun stress, or am I doing something wrong with watering or care?

So I built Spendy. It opens directly to the input screen. No dashboard to scroll past, no charts competing for your attention. Just open, log, close. Done.

The interesting thing is, after using it for a while, it became more than just a budget tracker - it turned into a spending diary. When I jot down something like ""convenience store beer after work - rough day today,"" I can look back and see exactly how I was feeling. It's a money log, but it reads like a journal.

**Features:**

* First screen = input screen
* Tags + notes let you keep it like a spending diary
* iCloud sync (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
* Shared budgets built-in
* No sign-up, no data stored on my servers

**Holiday sale:** \~\~$14.99\~\~ → **$7.49/year** (50% off)

I've been using it daily for over a year now. If you've never stuck with a budgeting app for more than a few days, this might be the one.

1pw3ih1,https://i.redd.it/te7tuxselj9g1.jpeg,My christmas gift: Me Espresso,"I finally got the Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth perfume in ""Me Espresso"" as a christmas gift, I heard theres a new one already, so I will get it when its available in germany of course. For anyone owning the new one already, which one do you like more this one or the lemon one?

I do know about the ""reputation"" this perfume has, that its allegedly more like a grape soda or just flowery. I dont know about either of that since it doesnt appear as that on my skin or clothes, but I have to report that this isnt sweet at all, which might be what throws people out in stark contrast to the other Sweet tooth perfumes. 

It is a coffee scent, but like a very dark coffee with artificial sweeteners and not something like a frappucino from star bucks. I can ever so slightly smell something sweet on my skin which reminds me much more of a tart fruit than a grape, but the coffee is stronger and on my clothes its a stark coffee. When all of that flows off, it smells like a sweet skin scent similiar to the ""caramel dream"" Sweet tooth perfume. I dont really like to talk about wear time but on my clothes did lasted the entire Wicked: For Good movie on me, on my skin its as weak as all other Sweet tooths. I do kinda wish after owning Lattafas Eclaire that there was a milky component to this perfume.

In comparisons to other coffee scents I know about like Black Opium or Vanille Caffee from Ulric De Varens, this doesnt share anything in common. Black Opium is sweeter than this and Vanille Caffee is this perfume but with a bunch of cigarettes and a booze and a fancy jacket.

I was puzzled on why this perfume is blue but this is apparently a homage to the baby blue clothes the singer wore during the time she released a song about coffee. I am happy to report that this time the plastic and colour of the perfume does match, not like with the cherry scents where the top part is an entirely different red.

  
Overall, very nice and unique. 9/10.



My ranking of all the sweet tooths I own:

1. Caramel Dream

2. Sweet Tooth OG and Me Espresso

3. Cherry Baby.

1pw3i5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1pw3i5r/i_only_had_one/,“I only had one”,"My boyfriend and I live in the same city, but spent Christmas in 2 different cities as I traveled to visit and stay with family for a week as Christmas is really important to my family who I don’t see nearly often enough. My boyfriend and I planned to celebrate Christmas Saturday evening as that is when I will be back in our town and we were going to watch a Christmas movie and exchange gifts then.

He got out of detox early November. Last night on Christmas Day he texted me how he was going to a casino and how he expected to lose $50 and go home. I was weary, but he’s a grown 36 year old man and I can’t control him. He’s been to casinos sober before (doesn’t have a gambling problem at all honestly, he just likes to go for fun once in awhile expecting to lose money) so I was hopeful. 

He texts me he was shocked because he left with $18 more dollars than when he started and we joked about how he should spend his “massive” winnings. A few hours go by. He texts me “wow some weed gummies made me extra high for some reason” and right then I knew he had drank. I knew he likely hadn’t taken edibles and he was using that statement so I’d think he was “just high on weed” if his texts got sloppy. I just had a gut instinct. I called him out on it. He said “well I only had one drink at a bar on the way home”. I said how I knew he definitely didn’t have just one. He said “ok, it was 2” (I also highly doubt it was just 2). Even if he had “only had 2”, it was probably more like 5, he had to have driven home afterwards and I can’t stand drinking and driving. I sent him a long text about how I will not be with someone who chooses alcohol over me and if he genuinely just wants to drink whenever he wants and go back to his old ways to please just let me know as I want a partner who wants to grow with me and together. He insists it was only 2 drinks on Christmas and that he could’ve lied to me and chose not to (but he did…he said it was one drink at first and then his story turned to 2). I told him there will always be a reason or excuse to drink. I let him know I just wanted to go to bed (didn’t want to argue or continue to talk to him as he could still be drinking and things might just get bad) and spent the night crying in my parents home after we had a lovely Christmas together (no one in my family drinks, they never have, it’s so lovely). He wished me goodnight and said he knew it would disappoint me, but he wanted to be honest. I woke up at 630am today and just started crying. I’ve seen this before and worry things will only get worse. I doubt he would’ve even told me about the “2” drinks if I didn’t ask.

I don’t want to text him today. I don’t want to see him Saturday. I don’t want to hug him and give him his gifts. I considered getting a breathalyzer as there have been nights he insists he is sober, but I am unsure. My logic is is that if he insists he’s sober when I’m questioning it and I pull a breathalyzer out of nowhere it would either confirm he’s being honest or give me the answer that I need to leave as I don’t think he’d ever expect me to buy a breathalyzer. I am torn between supporting him and staying or leaving now before I get more hurt. 

This subreddit has been has made me feel less alone. My heart goes out to all of you struggling with this as well. 

I am going to shower and put on a brave face for my parents as they think he is sober and doing well and I don’t have the heart to tell them about last night. Last night around 9PM my Mom checked her email and saw my Dad’s kidney bloodwork came back and his levels are terrible. He is not far off from needing dialysis. My Dad is 70 and seeing his health decline has been awful. We found this out after I had told my boyfriend I was going to bed. I wished he hadn’t drank so I could have shared this with him and got his support. I knew he was not in a mental place to do so. 

I’m glad I came home to spend a week with my family at my parent’s house. I am going to go have coffee with my Dad, go to the mall with my Mom, visit my Grandma, and then we are all going out to dinner to celebrate my birthday (it’s next week, but I won’t be here then).

Thank you to anyone who read this. This subreddit has been helpful and it’s so nice to not feel alone. I hope everyone has a great day today <3",2,1766753239.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

New to this community,
Have been brewing coffee specifically espresso for more than 7 years now. 
Have used this beast of a machine for 4-5 years now. 
It is the rancilio Silvia v6 limited black edition
Had got it custom painted last year to yellow color as I was bored of looking at the black color.
Have the invoice
Attaching a few photos of the machine. In case anyone is interested can show them on a video call or send any video that they want. 

Just a small description 
The Rancilio Silvia  is a highly regarded semi-automatic espresso machine known for excellent build quality and durability. It delivers rich, consistent espresso with good temperature stability and extraction control for its price. The steam wand is powerful, producing strong steam for dense, creamy milk micro-foam, ideal for lattes and cappuccinos once you master technique. Silvia machines are built to last, with a solid brass boiler and commercial-grade components that can run for many years with proper maintenance. It’s best for enthusiasts who enjoy hands-on brewing—less automated but very rewarding for quality espresso and milk drinks.

1pw3f4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1pw3f4h/how_to_work_4_hours_a_day_and_still_achieve_more/,How to Work 4 Hours a Day and Still Achieve More: The SCIENCE Based Productivity Framework Nobody Talks About.,"
For years I thought being  busy  meant being productive. I'd grind 12 hour days, respond to every notification, attend every meeting. Then I'd collapse at night wondering why I accomplished nothing meaningful. Sound familiar?

Most productivity advice is garbage. It's either toxic hustle culture that glorifies burnout, or lazy  life hack  BS that oversimplifies everything. The truth is somewhere uncomfortable in between. After diving deep into research from Cal Newport's work on deep work, Alex Hormozi's content on focus, and studying how top performers actually structure their days, I realized we've been doing this completely wrong.

The 4 hour workday isn't about working less. It's about working differently. It's about understanding that your brain literally cannot sustain high level cognitive work for 8+ hours. Biology doesn't care about your deadlines.

Deep work is the cheat code. Cal Newport's book  Deep Work  will genuinely change how you view productivity. The guy's a computer science professor at Georgetown who's published multiple books and runs a successful podcast, yet he's done by 5:30pm daily and never works weekends. The book breaks down why our addiction to shallow work, constant communication, endless meetings, is destroying our ability to do anything meaningful. Newport defines deep work as professional activities performed in a state of distraction free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. This type of work creates new value and is hard to replicate. Most people spend their entire careers never entering this state.

Here's what actually works. Protect your morning like your life depends on it. Your prefrontal cortex, the part responsible for complex thinking, is freshest within the first few hours after waking. This is when you should tackle your most cognitively demanding work. Not emails. Not meetings. Real work that moves the needle. I'm talking writing, coding, designing, strategizing, whatever requires genuine thought in your field.

Time blocking is non negotiable. Block out 2 to 4 hour chunks where you're completely unreachable. Phone on airplane mode. Slack closed. Door shut. Tell people you're in deep work and will respond later. Most  urgent  things can wait 3 hours. The ones that truly can't are rarer than you think. During these blocks, work on one thing only. Task switching obliterates productivity. Your brain needs roughly 23 minutes to fully re engage after an interruption, according to research from UC Irvine.

The app Freedom is genuinely life changing for blocking distracting websites and apps during focus sessions. You can schedule recurring block sessions so you don't even have to think about it. Costs like $40 yearly but saves you hundreds of hours of mindless scrolling. Another good one is Forest, which gamifies staying focused by growing a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. Sounds silly but the visual feedback is surprisingly effective.

BeFreed is an AI powered learning app that pulls from high quality sources like books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans around your specific goals. Built by AI experts from Google and Columbia grads, it's designed for people who want structured growth without dedicating extra hours to reading. You tell it what skills you're working on or what kind of person you want to become, and it generates custom podcasts at whatever depth you need, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples and context. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on how you interact with the content, and you can pause anytime to ask questions or explore tangents. It's been useful for turning commute time and gym sessions into actual learning instead of doomscrolling. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous improvement without adding more screen time to your day.

Energy management beats time management. You can't deep work for 4 hours straight on 5 hours of sleep while running on coffee and stress. The research is brutal here. Matthew Walker's  Why We Sleep  should be mandatory reading. Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired, it literally impairs cognitive function equivalent to being drunk. You're making worse decisions, solving problems slower, and retaining information poorly. Most high performers are religious about 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep.

Batch your shallow work ruthlessly. All those emails, messages, administrative tasks, they're necessary but they're not what you're paid to think about. Dedicate specific time blocks, maybe 1 hour after your deep work session, to blast through all of it at once. Trying to sprinkle it throughout the day fragments your attention and kills momentum.

Here's the part people hate hearing. Most meetings are productivity theater. They exist to make people feel busy and important. Before accepting any meeting, ask what decisions need to be made or what specific outcomes are expected. If there's no clear answer, it's probably a waste. Many meetings could be an email. Many emails could be a quick Slack message. Many Slack messages could be nothing at all.

The Pomodoro Technique helps if you struggle with sustained focus initially. Work for 25 minutes, break for 5. After 4 cycles, take a longer 15 to 30 minute break. It trains your focus muscle gradually. The timer creates urgency that combats Parkinson's Law, work expands to fill the time available. When you only have 25 minutes, you stop fucking around.

Protect your attention like it's your most valuable asset, because it is. Every notification, every popup, every person interrupting, they're all stealing your capacity to do meaningful work. Your attention is finite and once it's fragmented, it's incredibly hard to reassemble. Companies spend billions trying to capture your attention. Don't give it away for free.

The 4 hour workday isn't lazy. It's strategic. It's recognizing that knowledge work rewards output quality, not input hours. You can either spend 10 hours being busy or 4 hours being effective. The market doesn't care how long you worked. It cares what you produced. This shift in thinking, from hours logged to value created, is what separates people who burn out from people who build sustainable success.",1,1766752950.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for some honest, practical feedback because I feel like I’ve hit a long plateau despite being very consistent.

# Stats / Body Composition

* **Weight:** \~67 kg
* **BMI:** \~23.6
* **Body fat:** \~19–20%
* **Lean body mass:** \~54 kg
* **Muscle %:** \~42%
* **Visceral fat:** Low / healthy range

(From a smart scale — I know BIA isn’t perfect, but trends have been stable over time.)

**Goal:** Look more **muscular and defined** (not necessarily huge).

# Training History

* **Consistency:** \~18 months
* **Weights:** \~5 days/week
* **Cardio:** Running 1–2×/week
* **Tracking:** All workouts logged in **Hevy**, cardio via **Garmin/Strava**

# Recent Training Volume

* **\~23 workouts in the last month**
* Training frequency has been consistent throughout the year
* Most frequently performed exercises in the last 30 days:
   * Plank (6×)
   * Dumbbell lateral raises (5×)
   * Triceps pushdowns (4×)
   * Upright rows (4×)

So volume and consistency aren’t random — I’m training regularly and logging everything.

# Current Training Split (typical week)

**Day 1 – Back & Biceps**

* Lat pulldowns / rows
* Barbell or dumbbell curls

**Day 2 – Legs & Abs**

* Hack squat
* Leg press
* Leg extensions
* Hanging leg raises / ab wheel

**Day 3 – Chest & Triceps**

* Bench / incline bench
* Chest press
* Triceps pushdowns / dips

**Day 4 – Shoulders & Abs**

* Shoulder press
* Lateral raises
* Upright rows
* Abs

**Day 5 – Repeat Back & Biceps**

* Sessions \~60–75 min
* Mostly **8–15 rep range**
* Mix of machines + free weights
* Rarely train very heavy (3–5 reps)

# Cardio

* **Running 1–2×/week**
* \~5 km per run
* Moderate pace

# Diet (typical day)

I *think* my diet is mostly decent, but I don’t track calories.

* **Breakfast:** Coffee + oats + protein powder (\~30 g protein) + green juice
* **Snack:** Muesli bar
* **Lunch:** Sushi
* **Afternoon:** Chips / salty snacks
* **Dinner:** Rice + chicken **or** beef **or** salmon
* **Night:** Protein bar (\~50 g protein)

I don’t deliberately bulk or cut — I’m probably hovering around maintenance most of the time.

# The Problem

Despite:

* \~18 months of consistency
* \~5 lifting days/week
* \~20+ workouts/month
* Reasonable protein intake
* Healthy body composition

I feel like:

* I don’t look noticeably more muscular
* I’m not getting leaner either
* Strength gains have slowed
* My physique has basically stalled

I *feel* fit, but I don’t **look** how I expected after this amount of work.

# Questions

1. Am I just spinning my wheels because I’m not eating in a surplus, even though my diet is “clean”?
2. Is my split suboptimal (too much isolation / machines, not enough key compounds)?
3. Is this a classic case of training at maintenance for too long?
4. Is running 1–2×/week interfering with hypertrophy, or basically irrelevant here?

# Specific follow-up (based on feedback I’ve already received)

A lot of people have suggested adding or switching to a **“full body” day, but what does that actually mean in practice?**

* What exercises are typically included in a full-body workout?
* How many lifts?
* What rep ranges and intensity?
* Is it heavy compounds only, or a mix?

Basically, what would a **good example of a full-body day** actually look like?

Also, looking at my **current split**, is there a **major movement pattern or lift that I’m underdoing or missing altogether** (e.g. heavy squats, hip hinge/deadlifts, vertical pulling, heavy pressing)?

I’d really appreciate **concrete examples**, not just “do compounds” or “eat more”.

* Mostly **8–15 rep range**
* Mix of machines + free weights
* Rarely train very heavy (3–5 reps)

# Cardio

* **Running 1–2×/week**
* \~5 km per run
* Moderate pace

# Diet (typical day)

I *think* my diet is mostly decent, but I don’t track calories.

* **Breakfast:** Coffee + oats + protein powder (\~30 g protein) + green juice
* **Snack:** Muesli bar
* **Lunch:** Sushi
* **Afternoon:** Chips / salty snacks
* **Dinner:** Rice + chicken **or** beef **or** salmon
* **Night:** Protein bar (\~50 g protein)

I don’t deliberately bulk or cut — I’m probably hovering around maintenance most of the time.

# The Problem

Despite:

* \~18 months of consistency
* \~5 lifting days/week
* \~20+ workouts/month
* Reasonable protein intake
* Healthy body composition

I feel like:

* I don’t look noticeably more muscular
* I’m not getting leaner either
* Strength gains have slowed
* My physique has basically stalled

I *feel* fit, but I don’t **look** how I expected after this amount of work.

# Questions

1. Am I just spinning my wheels because I’m not eating in a surplus, even though my diet is “clean”?
2. Is my split suboptimal (too much isolation / machines, not enough key compounds)?
3. Is this a classic case of training at maintenance for too long?
4. Is running 1–2×/week interfering with hypertrophy, or basically irrelevant here?

# Specific follow-up (based on feedback I’ve already received)

A lot of people have suggested adding or switching to a **“full body” day, but what does that actually mean in practice?**

* What exercises are typically included in a full-body workout?
* How many lifts?
* What rep ranges and intensity?
* Is it heavy compounds only, or a mix?

Basically, what would a **good example of a full-body day** actually look like?

Also, looking at my **current split**, is there a **major movement pattern or lift that I’m underdoing or missing altogether** (e.g. heavy squats, hip hinge/deadlifts, vertical pulling, heavy pressing)?

I’d really appreciate **concrete examples**, not just “do compounds” or “eat more”.

1pw3bh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/comments/1pw3bh4/really_struggling_during_the_holidays/,Really struggling during the holidays,"Hi ! Honestly, just venting. I need to talk with someone that understands because right now, I feel like the only sane person in the house and loneliness is getting to me.  
  
I've left my parents house a few years ago, lived on my own and came back on the weekends for the first years, lived with a roommate (a very clean person) for four years and now live accross the country with other roommates. I've been away from home a long time and it doesn't feel like my house anymore.

My parents and brother have gone full hoarders at this point. I just came back a few days ago for the holidays and I'm losing my mind. I don't remember the house being this bad when I was here, but surely it was. No toilet flush is working properly (every toilet is dirty), there's dust and dirt and mold everywhere if you just look long enough. I made the mistake last time I was here to ask them to bring a bag of old medication, acne creams and such, to the pharmacy to be recycled : I found the same creams in my mom's basket in the bathroom. They have 5 or more toothbrushes each, each white with cheap, dried, old toothpaste. The bathtub is non-functional most of the time, filled with dirty clothes that are awaiting their turn in the washing machine (that is downstairs, because the one in the bathroom is and has been broken for months, I even offered to replace it and they didn't want to). When it's not filled with clothes, they don't empty the water so they can reuse it to flush the toilet. 

My mom has various projects and don't ever see completion : seeds that have been molding on the windowsill, jams that never set and end up tasting and smelling of strong alcohol, a pile of coffee capsules that she ""puts in the compost"" (I've looked and there's no compost anywhere). 

My dad isn't better : the garage is filled to the brim with broken car pieces, the garden makes it look like he owns a car factory. Most of them aren't working. You couldn't park a car in the garage if you tried ; I often trip even just walking there. 

I've been sneakily throwing things out but I know it will only get worse. My grandpa died last summer and they've been collecting things from the house... It really blows my mind they don't see the irony in the situation, they used to make fun of him and be concerned with his health when they found old food items or broken appliances and now they do just that. My mom was reluctant to throwing out spices from his house : cinnamon, cloves, very common spices that were expired to the point of no return. I found them in our house's spice cabinet. I just put them in the bin. No one likes cinnamon in this house except me anyway. 

I've been going crazy. The house is super cold because the heater broke and they chose not to replace it, they're been using a small pellet fireplace (i don't know what they're called) which works but not as good as a heater. There's limescale everywhere.

On top of that, my brother is a complete asshole. 

  
I can't talk to my parents about any of the things I just said. They just shrug, my mom says they're been fixing this or that and it \*just\* broke yesterday / last week. That they work too much and don't have time. That it's their house and they do want they want with it. But they're just poisoning themselves. My dad just makes funny faces until I get angry and then he doesn't have to answer anymore. I truly, deeply, believe they all need psychological help.

When I think too long about all of that, it makes me want to never come home. I love my parents and it pains me so much to imagine them living in those conditions : cold, moldy, crumbling house filled with trash. But they refuse all conversations about it and I feel hopeless. But the stress and the anxiety I've been dealing with for the past 6 days made me look at plane tickets today, and I want to go home earlier. But I don't want to do it because I know it'll break my parent's hearts... 

Any advice on what I could do about any of that ? I needed to vent but I'm scared it didn't help much, there's still so much I want to say and just need someone to agree with me that this isn't normal.

# Dec. 22, 2025~NioCorp to Begin Construction of Mine Portal at its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project

[NioCorp to Begin Construction of Mine Portal at its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project](https://mailchi.mp/niocorp.com/niocorp-to-begin-construction-of-mine-portal-at-its-elk-creek-critical-minerals-project?e=8b2b97c99e)

https://preview.redd.it/chyrr1crij9g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c96ea4f232d191ec1c3278f0f92a4fe38881b8f2

The **Dec. 22 Board approval of the Mine Portal Project** confirms that **pre-construction activities at the Elk Creek site have begun**, moving the company from planning into **irreversible execution**. This includes excavation, blasting, access roads, and preparation for underground mining using the electrified Railveyor™ system.

This step is **not cosmetic**—you don’t approve and fund a $44.6M portal project unless management expects financing, permits, and project execution to proceed. The portal directly supports upcoming milestones such as uplifting resources from probable to proven, advancing the updated Feasibility Study, and strengthening EXIM financing confidence.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[The assays & DFS will Re-Rate the entire project. The NAMA ScAl alloy & Vertical integrations will drive revenues to another level.... staying tuned!](https://reddit.com/link/1pw3awm/video/znz1nz5akj9g1/player)

IMHO \~What I’m watching most closely now on Jim's ""**TO Do LIST 2026** above""—alongside assays and the updated DFS—is the **anticipated February 2026 ScAl alloy reveal** and how it ties directly into NAMA’s execution of its **Pentagon contract deliverables**, specifically **Scandium metal production** and **Lockheed-led Al-Sc alloy component milestones**.

**These are not conceptual announcements**; they are performance-based deliverables tied to defense validation, component testing, and manufacturability thresholds. Successful completion opens the door to **commercial offtake discussions under NAMA**, potential **follow-on Pentagon partnerships beyond initial DoD validation**, and broader aerospace and defense adoption.

When combined with portal construction, oxide production readiness, and scandium metal output, the picture shifts decisively—Elk Creek stops being “a mine” and becomes a **vertically integrated U.S. critical materials platform**, supplying inputs all the way from ore to defense-grade alloys.

This is exactly the type of integration EXIM and other strategic lenders look for, as it de-risks revenue durability and national-interest relevance. If these execution milestones land as management has outlined, it is reasonable to expect **EXIM Final Investment Decision and broader government-backed financing to converge in mid-2026**, potentially as early as June, marking the transition from validation to full-scale buildout.

**The key realization is this:** NioCorp’s Scandium → Sc metal → ScAl alloy → aerospace component chain is not absent from the DFS — it is intentionally **sequenced after financing** because that is how the U.S. government and major aerospace primes structure strategic supply chains. Mines get financed first. Demonstration milestones come second. **Alloy commercialization and manufacturing facilities come third.** This is the same pattern used for MP Materials, for Lynas, for Round Top, and for every large-scale critical mineral program aligned with U.S. defense needs. By isolating the mine economics in the DFS and keeping alloy tech under **NAMA**, NioCorp preserves flexibility **for DoD-backed vertical integration under Title III or through private OEM contracts.**

Put simply: Jim Sims’ responses don’t contradict a 2026 Construction hypothesis **— they validate it!** The DFS is Step 1. Financing is Step 2. Vertical integration is Step 3. By the time NioCorp is in full production in 2029–2030, the company could control not just the raw materials market but also the downstream scandium, niobium, titanium and REE alloy value chains — exactly what the U.S. defense ecosystem needs, and exactly what NAMA + FEA IP were created to deliver. **2026 won’t be the finish line — it will be the reveal that NioCorp’s multi-revenue, multi-product, mine-to-metal strategy is fully underway.**

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# “We’re there!!” — Why 2026 Is the Year for NioCorp

**Mark Smith & Jim Sims saying it plainly:** ***“We’re there. We’re going to be able to start construction in 2026, next year.”*** After years of permitting, engineering, financing work, and validation, management is now openly talking about construction activity, site work, and visible progress on the ground. That’s not speculative language — that’s execution language.

What stood out most wasn’t just optimism, but certainty. Mark repeatedly emphasized momentum, **calling 2025 “nothing less than a phenomenal year”** and making it clear that 2026 is when the work becomes visible: portals, construction activity, and tangible progress at Elk Creek. **That lines up perfectly with what shareholders have been watching all year — drilling completion, assays underway, DFS work advancing, EXIM engagement, DoD funding, land acquisition finished, and now portal construction approved for Q1 2026.**

# For anyone still wondering “what changes in 2026?” — this is it. The story transitions from validation to build-out. From paperwork to equipment. From waiting to watching.

1pw3awf,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1pw3awf/18_months_of_consistent_lifting_running_tracked/,"18 months of consistent lifting + running (tracked data, body comp included) but not getting more muscular — what am I missing?","Hey everyone,  
I’m looking for some honest, practical feedback because I feel like I’ve hit a long plateau despite being very consistent.

# Stats / Body Composition

* **Weight:** \~67 kg
* **BMI:** \~23.6
* **Body fat:** \~19–20%
* **Lean body mass:** \~54 kg
* **Muscle %:** \~42%
* **Visceral fat:** Low / healthy range

(From a smart scale — I know BIA isn’t perfect, but trends have been stable over time.)

**Goal:** Look more **muscular and defined** (not necessarily huge).

# Training History

* **Consistency:** \~18 months
* **Weights:** \~5 days/week
* **Cardio:** Running 1–2×/week
* **Tracking:** All workouts logged in **Hevy**, cardio via **Garmin/Strava**

# Recent Training Volume

* **\~23 workouts in the last month**
* Training frequency has been consistent throughout the year
* Most frequently performed exercises in the last 30 days:
   * Plank (6×)
   * Dumbbell lateral raises (5×)
   * Triceps pushdowns (4×)
   * Upright rows (4×)

So volume and consistency aren’t random — I’m training regularly and logging everything.

# Current Training Split (typical week)

**Day 1 – Back & Biceps**

* Lat pulldowns / rows
* Barbell or dumbbell curls

**Day 2 – Legs & Abs**

* Hack squat
* Leg press
* Leg extensions
* Hanging leg raises / ab wheel

**Day 3 – Chest & Triceps**

* Bench / incline bench
* Chest press
* Triceps pushdowns / dips

**Day 4 – Shoulders & Abs**

* Shoulder press
* Lateral raises
* Upright rows
* Abs

**Day 5 – Repeat Back & Biceps**

* Sessions \~60–75 min
* Mostly **8–15 rep range**
* Mix of machines + free weights
* Rarely train very heavy (3–5 reps)

# Cardio

* **Running 1–2×/week**
* \~5 km per run
* Moderate pace

# Diet (typical day)

I *think* my diet is mostly decent, but I don’t track calories.

* **Breakfast:** Coffee + oats + protein powder (\~30 g protein) + green juice
* **Snack:** Muesli bar
* **Lunch:** Sushi
* **Afternoon:** Chips / salty snacks
* **Dinner:** Rice + chicken **or** beef **or** salmon
* **Night:** Protein bar (\~50 g protein)

I don’t deliberately bulk or cut — I’m probably hovering around maintenance most of the time.

# The Problem

Despite:

* \~18 months of consistency
* \~5 lifting days/week
* \~20+ workouts/month
* Reasonable protein intake
* Healthy body composition

I feel like:

* I don’t look noticeably more muscular
* I’m not getting leaner either
* Strength gains have slowed
* My physique has basically stalled

I *feel* fit, but I don’t **look** how I expected after this amount of work.

# Questions

1. Am I just spinning my wheels because I’m not eating in a surplus, even though my diet is “clean”?
2. Is my split suboptimal (too much isolation / machines, not enough key compounds)?
3. Is this a classic case of training at maintenance for too long?
4. Is running 1–2×/week interfering with hypertrophy, or basically irrelevant here?

# Specific follow-up (based on feedback I’ve already received)

A lot of people have suggested adding or switching to a **“full body” day, but what does that actually mean in practice?**

* What exercises are typically included in a full-body workout?
* How many lifts?
* What rep ranges and intensity?
* Is it heavy compounds only, or a mix?

Basically, what would a **good example of a full-body day** actually look like?

Also, looking at my **current split**, is there a **major movement pattern or lift that I’m underdoing or missing altogether** (e.g. heavy squats, hip hinge/deadlifts, vertical pulling, heavy pressing)?

I’d really appreciate **concrete examples**, not just “do compounds” or “eat more”.

1pw33px,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pw33px/the_lady_upstairs/,The lady upstairs,"After 36 years of living in an apartment complex, I can confidently attest that a night owl is the worst kind of neighbor. Being as lucky as I am, I had one of those moving into the apartment right above mine at the start of October.

It was a lady who seemed to have an endless supply of worldly goods that all needed to be put into place the moment she moved in. Every single evening, at 9 pm exactly, she would start either hammering away, drilling the walls, or pushing furniture across her floor, always managing to reach the noise level of an angry bull in heat.

I have always had quite sensitive ears, so I’m no stranger to being awake at night because of bothersome noises. There is always noise in the city, whether from drunkards singing at the top of their lungs or nocturnal critters running amok in the streets. Trust me, the sheer number of times I’ve been woken up by an opossum knocking over a trashcan outside my window is ridiculous. The thing is - these disturbances would always be occasional and brief; whenever they occurred, I could easily fall back asleep afterwards. But ever since the day that lady moved in, the night has been filled with constant sounds of her mayhem.

The cacophony upstairs would go on every evening for about 3-4 days in a row. Then, at some point, I would hear a large thudding sound, indicating that she had brought out yet another box full of stuff that needed to be set up. This routine sent me into a hellish cycle of exhaustion: I would fall asleep late and wake up exhausted in the morning. I would then have to drown myself in coffee and go to work, hoping that I could get some sleep later in the evening.

Don’t tell me that I just should’ve confronted her. I didn’t want her to think that I was just some cranky old man. Besides, I don’t like confronting people; I have always felt awful whenever I’ve had to reprimand someone. I also didn’t know her name, which I felt would have made the interaction even more unbearable. I just sat on my couch, waiting for the commotion to stop.

Suddenly, three weeks had passed, and she showed no signs of being finished unpacking.

The seeds of chaos were planted as the clock struck 9 pm on an unusually hot evening late into October. An evening so hot that I had to have my windows open to be comfortable. The lady upstairs started toiling away, following her usual schedule.

It was just as loud as all the other days. I twisted and turned in my bed, trying to cover my ears with my pillow, as I had done so many nights before. But this night was different. The heat, mixed with my drowsiness and the sounds from upstairs, all compiled into a thundering migraine. It felt as if my brain was swelling, trying to crack my head open and run away to escape the noise. I couldn’t take it any longer.

I sat up in my bed, inhaled all the air that could fit into my lungs, and yelled:

“QUUUIIIIIEEET!”

My yelling was followed by a large thud from upstairs. She had just started unpacking another box, I thought to myself. I couldn’t believe it. She had to have heard me. My yelling was so loud that they probably heard me all the way up on the 5th floor. I stared at the ceiling, awaiting the sounds of the troublemaker and her orchestra from hell.

I waited, and then I waited some more. More time passed, but there were no more sounds coming from upstairs. Maybe she did hear me. Maybe she was finally being respectful.

I felt my headache subside as I lay back down. I closed my eyes, letting my fatigue carry me towards slumber. I was completely unbothered for the first night in a long time. I rose with the sun several hours later, and I didn’t have to chug half a liter of coffee to stay awake. I went to work with a smile on my face and a good feeling in my body.

Everything was easier. I was happier. It was paradise compared to before.

I came home that evening, hoping that the night before wasn’t an exception. If only I had been that lucky.

After the sun had gone down, there was activity in the upstairs apartment again. This time, though, the sounds were a bit different. All I could hear was

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

Repeating over and over again.

I couldn’t place the sound. It didn’t come from any tool that I knew of; I was sure of that. There were irregular pauses between the sounds, ranging from about five seconds to ten seconds. It wasn’t just heavy footsteps, that was for sure; the spaces between them were too big. It wasn’t a hammer either; the sounds were much too quiet for that.

This thought process continued as I lay in my bed that night, my weary eyes fixated on the ceiling.

“Maybe she’s tapping her foot on the floor to a song… But the sounds are not rhythmical in the slightest … Maybe she’s dropping a ball repeatedly… But why would she even do that? Is she a juggler? No… that’d be ridiculous.”

These were but some of the thoughts rushing through my head as the sounds kept resonating in the background. It was beyond the midnight hours before I fell asleep that night.

When I woke up in the morning, the noises had stopped. I assumed that she had just started working on her apartment again. Throughout the whole day, at my work and when I went home, I silently prayed that I wouldn’t hear those sounds from her apartment again. Even though they were less noisy than normal, there was something about not being able to identify them that just made them much more annoying. To my dismay, however, the noises had begun anew by the rising of the moon.

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

Lying in my bed that night, I was gritting my teeth out of sheer annoyance. I covered my head with my pillow again, but it was no use; I could still hear the sounds no matter how much I tried to keep them out. They made me feel as if someone was constantly poking at my brain, molding it like a piece of clay.

Maybe it was revenge; maybe, just maybe, she was mad about my yelling and was doing this to get back at me. Maybe she just wanted to drive me nuts with her antics. I tried to fall asleep, but it wasn’t happening. The sounds from upstairs echoed in my head, much louder than any of the sounds that had been there in the weeks before. It was pure agony.

My heart skipped a beat as my phone started ringing. I cautiously picked it up, wondering who was calling in the middle of the night.

“H - Hello?” I mumbled.

“Peterson! Where the fuck are you, man? We’ve been waiting for you for 45 minutes!”

“Oh, hello, sir… I’m sorry, but my shift doesn’t start till…” I looked towards my window.

The rays of sunlight had already broken through and cast light onto my floor.

“SHIT! S - Sorry, sir… I’ll be there in fifteen minutes!” I said as I got out of bed and hung up the phone.

What followed was one of the worst days I’ve ever had in my life. I was a walking corpse with only one thing on my mind: what were those sounds?

I eventually got home, and I didn’t care about relaxing. Relaxation wasn’t even on my mind. All I wanted to do, and all I did, was await the sounds. I sat on my couch, staring at the ceiling, and like clockwork, the commotion started back up late into the evening.

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

I couldn’t take it another night; it was torture. I didn’t care what she thought of me anymore. I didn’t care about having to scold her. I stormed out the door and up the stairs and pounded on the door.

“WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM?!”

The sound stopped, but I wasn’t satisfied; they were going to start again. I wasn’t fooled.

I turned the door handle and walked inside. Her apartment was cold like night and as silent as a library. I walked into the living room, and that’s where I found her.

She was lying on her back at the foot of a small stepladder. She lay beside the corner of a wooden table. The corner was covered in a mixture of dried brown blood and long black hairs. On the side of her head was a crater of blood, hair, skull fragments, and brain matter. Both of her arms were mangled to the bone. A swarm of flies was nesting on her body. The windows in the living room stood open, taking in the autumn breeze and wafting away any smell of rot there should have been. As I stood there, taking it all in, I heard some skittering. I stared in disbelief as a chubby little form crept out from one of the moving crates on the floor, where it had likely been hiding from all the noise I had made.

It was an opossum, currently unaware of my presence.

It crawled over to the body and started gnawing at her hand. Every time the opossum ripped off a piece of flesh, the hand was lifted into the air before subsequently dropping to the floor, producing a light bump.",7,1766751885.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1pw32xy,https://i.redd.it/y3miuw54kj9g1.jpeg,The 5 Zodiac Signs Most Likely to Meet Their Person in 2026,"*A practitioner’s perspective on the cosmic alignments bringing once-in-a-decade romantic opportunities*

I’ll never forget the woman who came to me last January, tears streaming down her face, asking if she’d ever find love. She was 34, had just ended another situationship that went nowhere, and was convinced something was fundamentally wrong with her.

“Everyone else seems to find their person,” she whispered. “Why not me?”

I looked at her chart. I saw what was coming. And I told her: **“Your story isn’t over. It hasn’t even really begun yet.”**

She met her fiancé that September.

After two decades of reading charts on [coto](https://app.coto.world/uv1xT3VEpZb), I can tell you this with certainty: [**Timing is everything. And 2026? This is the year many of you have been waiting for**](https://app.coto.world/uv1xT3VEpZb)**.**

# Why 2026 Is Different

We’re transitioning from the Year of the Snake (2025) into the Year of the Horse (2026) — and this shift is massive.

The Snake year asked you to shed old skins. To release relationships that weren’t right, patterns that kept you stuck, versions of yourself that blocked real love. It was painful. You might have felt like you were going backward while everyone else moved forward.

**But you weren’t going backward. You were preparing.**

The Horse year brings galloping momentum and magnetic connection. Horses don’t run alone — they seek their herd. Combined with rare planetary alignments I only see once a decade, 2026 is creating extraordinary opportunities for the right people to find each other.

And for five signs in particular, the cosmos is orchestrating something undeniable.

# 1. Cancer: You’re Finally Being Seen

Cancer, I know you’ve been the one holding space for everyone else. Nurturing friends through breakups, showing up for family, creating safety for people who rarely return the favor. You’ve wondered if anyone will ever take care of *you* the way you take care of them.

**2026 is answering that question.**

Your visibility is expanding in ways you haven’t experienced in twelve years. People suddenly *see* you differently — your depth, your tenderness, your capacity for love becomes magnetic.

I had a Cancer client who’d been single for six years. Last summer, she walked into a coffee shop and locked eyes with someone across the room. They talked for four hours.

“It felt like he was looking for me,” she told me. “Like he’d been searching for exactly who I am.”

**Your person isn’t scared of your emotions — they’re craving them.**

**Your window**: February through July. Trust those unexpected invitations, those chance encounters, those moments when someone appears out of nowhere.

# 2. Libra: Stop Performing, Start Being

Libra, you’re exhausted from making yourself easier to love. From smoothing over rough edges. From being the peacemaker who adjusts themselves to fit whatever the other person needs.

**2026 is asking you to stop.**

The cosmos is redirecting you toward *authentic* partnership — not the Instagram-perfect kind, but the messy, real, I-see-all-of-you-and-I’m-staying kind.

Here’s the beautiful paradox: **The moment you stop trying to be perfect is the moment your person appears.**

I watched a Libra client finally end a relationship that looked perfect on paper but felt hollow. Someone else showed up within weeks — someone who loved her sharp edges, her occasional mess, her moments of indecision.

“I thought I had to have it all together,” she cried. “But he loves me because I don’t.”

**Your window**: March through September. Pay attention during eclipse season (March 14, September 7) — people who enter during eclipses arrive to change everything.

Stop auditioning for love. Your person is already looking for exactly who you are.

# 3. Aquarius: You’re Not Too Much

Aquarius, you’ve convinced yourself you’re too weird, too intellectual, too independent for partnership. But what if everything you thought made you unlovable is exactly what your person is searching for?

**The Year of the Horse is calling you out of your head and into your heart.**

I had an Aquarius client — a quantum physicist — who’d resigned herself to interesting conversations and casual connections, nothing more. Then she met someone at a conference who not only understood her work, he challenged it. Who matched her 3am intensity and raised her two more.

“I didn’t know this existed,” she told me. “I thought I had to choose between my mind and my heart.”

**You don’t. Your person wants both.**

**Your window**: April through October. If you meet someone during this period who *gets* you in that distinctive way — trust it.

The right person won’t ask you to be less. They’ll give you permission to be more.

# 4. Taurus: The Stability You’ve Been Craving

Taurus, you’re tired. Since 2018, everything solid has felt temporary. Relationships ended. Plans fell apart. You’ve been in survival mode so long you forgot what it feels like to rest in love.

**It’s finally time to rest.**

The cosmic chaos that’s been shaking your foundation for seven years is ending. You’ll feel something you haven’t felt in years: ground beneath your feet. The ability to trust again.

But here’s the gift: You’re not the same Taurus who entered this cycle. You’ve learned to release control, to stay open even when it hurt. **The person you’re about to meet will love this version of you** — the one who’s done the work, who knows their own strength now.

I had a Taurus client who lost everything — her marriage, her home, her entire sense of self. She rebuilt slowly, painfully. Last year, she met someone who didn’t promise forever on the first date. He promised presence. One day at a time.

“I used to think I needed guarantees,” she said. “Now I know I just need someone who shows up.”

**Your window**: June through November. By then, you’re solid but open. Grounded but ready. That’s when love finds you.

# 5. Scorpio: Your Intensity Is Your Gift

Scorpio, you’ve been told you’re too intense. Too deep. Too much. That you need to lighten up, stop wanting connections that transform everything.

**What if everything you’ve been told is wrong?**

You’ve been doing shadow work while everyone else was surface-level dating. You’ve faced darkness most people avoid their whole lives. And you’re wondering if anyone can hold all of that.

**Yes. Someone will.**

The Year of the Horse brings fire to your water — passion, visibility, courage. Your intensity won’t scare the right person away. **It will draw them in like a magnet.**

I’ll never forget the Scorpio client convinced she’d die alone because she “felt too much.” Then she met someone who didn’t flinch at her depth. Who asked to see her shadows. Who looked at her intensity and said, “More. Show me more.”

She called me crying after their third date. Relief tears.

“I thought I had to hide,” she sobbed. “But he wants everything I’ve been afraid to show.”

**Your window**: January through August. When you feel that soul-deep, immediate recognition — don’t run from it. That’s your cosmic confirmation.

Your intensity isn’t a flaw. It’s been waiting for someone who can match it.

# The Truth About Hope

If you’re reading this and feeling that flutter in your chest — that dangerous, vulnerable thing called hope — **protect it.**

I know you’ve been disappointed before. I know you’ve started to believe maybe it won’t happen for you.

**You’re not the exception.**

The cosmic alignments of 2026 are real. The Year of the Horse’s momentum is real. But they’re not magic tricks — they’re *invitations*.

You still have to do the work. You still have to show up. You still have to believe you’re worthy, even on days when that feels impossible.

But here’s what I know after twenty years: **The universe doesn’t create these alignments for nothing.** When the cosmos orchestrates this level of opportunity, it’s because the right people are finally ready for each other.

Maybe you’ve been getting ready your whole life.

Maybe every heartbreak was teaching you what you actually need.

Maybe every night alone was preparing you to recognize home when it finally appears.

**And maybe 2026 is when your paths finally cross.**

# What Happens Next

The stars are aligned. The portal is open. The Year of the Horse is bringing momentum you haven’t felt in years.

If you’re one of these five signs, you’re being given a once-in-a-decade opportunity to meet someone who can match you, grow with you, transform alongside you.

**Don’t waste it hiding. Don’t waste it playing small.**

Your person is out there right now, being guided toward you by the same cosmic forces guiding you toward them.

All you have to do is trust the journey — and show up ready for the love you’ve been preparing to receive.

Gusto ko muna mag-work ng face to face—kasi nag-e-escalate lalo anxiety ko from thinking unnecessary things pag nasa bahay lang after work, and lalong nawawala yung social life ko, plus I don’t want to box myself. Also, the degree I’m taking needs engagement with people. I really wanna help myself.

Baka may alam kayong mga food establishment or coffee shops around Manila that’s accepting working students . Ayoko lang sa mga fast food para hindi masyado ako mapagod nang bongga at may ample time pa ako to process my day.

1pw30jn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw30jn,Hocker or no?,"I'm debating on getting a hocker for my couch.
Right now I'm only sitting in the corner as I like to have my feet up and/or be in a lying position when chilling. At my parents I used to put a cushion on the coffee table but it would start to get uncomfortable after a while. 
I'm hoping a hocker would make me sit on the other parts of the couch. Also love the idea of having a 'bed' vibe when I push the hocker towards the corner.

The yellow chair is usually in the corner where the christmas tree is now. 

However, I am scared it might make the space too crowded and that such a tight u-couch just looks a bit weird?. I also have no other space to really put it when it gets in the way, besides taking it all the way down into my dusty storage space which isn't ideal.

Alternatively I could go for a small footstool which I then also would be able to use for the yellow chair. But then I will not be able to achieve the 'bed' feel.

Side note: Haven't had the couch for too long so colour difference will not be an issue.",1,1766751566.0,InteriorDesign,2,1.0,False

Grinding beans in a certain way 
Always using the same mug 
Refusing to brew before sunrise
Stirring exactly twice and then stopping 

Some of these habits don’t improve taste. They just make coffee feel right.

I will start, I use the same mug every day, every time I brew.

Curious to hear: what’s your one coffee habit that you’d defend for no logical reason at all?
