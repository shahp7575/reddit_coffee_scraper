I counted 100+ AI things in one day. ONE DAY. And now I can't unsee it. Literally can't drive somewhere I've been 20 times without GPS.

We met in September, but became better friends in January and have been getting closer since then.

Last night was especially interesting; he never talked about his dad before. But last night he told me all about him (while intoxicated), and how he was estranged from him, and his dad's recent death. He was very vulnerable. I'm glad he trusted me with it. i had no idea about any of it

Here are other things he's done:

* I notice he looks at me a lot when we're in a group, even when I'm not talking
* He helped me tour apartments, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language that well), and used his car to move all my stuff.
* He walked me home on my first night at my new apartment, even though his house is much closer.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo I took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut my steak during a meal after I had just offered him a bite (he cut the whole steak, then took a piece). When a friend pointed out that he's too nice to me, and that's why she thought he likes me, he just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. He also asked who else thinks that he likes me (in our office)
* He pays attention to the things I do or do not like. And he proudly points out that he remembers whenever it's brought up, or tells people (like when I put too much spice on my food, he tells them ""oh she likes spicy food""
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants, and i played along, he got panicked and defensive, and has been getting more embarrassed by small things when his friends point them out in front of me
* When a man stalked me and asked me out in the office, I told him how it made me uncomfortable and explained what happened, so he called the guy a creep and went to look for him to make sure he wasn't around still.
* When his friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at me and smiled, and tilted his head as if asking, ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""

But there are signs he may not like me:

* He’s deflected my invitation to go walk by the river twice, the first time he was hungover and sick, the second time he had to work.
* He’s never taken much initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another time to grab coffee.
* When I offered to accompany him on a long trip (2-3 hours) even though I had a deadline, he said i should probably stay and work. I told him I'm almost finished with my work, but he told me the trip might take longer, so it's okay, and that I should stay back. I feel like sometimes he avoids one-on-one time (could be due to overthinking and his english skills; he did tell me he wants to be more talkative with me in english like he is in his native language with his other friends, thats why he's trying really hard to learn it recently)",1,1750054152.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. Still doing a new playthrough of Mass Effect. Tali all the way. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

I'm down for swapping selfies and moving onto other platforms if things are cool.

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian science of health and well-being, teaches us to harmonize our lifestyle with nature's cycle. Documented as Ritucharya, seasonal customs are a fundamental pillar of Ayurveda. Depending on the season, our body is affected in a specific manner, and summer, as hot, dry, and packed with energy, is believed to vitiate the Pitta dosha.



For individuals who want to maintain balance and remain healthy in the summer season, an Ayurveda summer regimen is necessary. And if you want to consult professional practitioners, Panchkarma centers in Prayagraj, Naturopathy centers in Prayagraj, or a reputed Ayurvedic treatment center in Prayagraj Can give comprehensive treatment as per seasonal adaptation. 



**Summer and the Pitta Dosha**



In summer, the Pitta dosha dominates Ayurveda, which is associated with fire and water. When the Pitta dosha is out of balance, it may produce conditions such as acidity, rashes, mood swings, inflammation, dryness, and slowness. Ayurvedic classics suggest soothing, cooling, and nutritional treatments that restore internal equilibrium to this.



Chronic Pitta patients are cured by treatments like [**Panchkarma in Prayagraj**](https://prakritivedawellness.com/), a cleansing treatment offered by different Ayurvedic hospitals in Prayagraj, that removes the toxins gathered in the body and sets the body's balance.



**Ayurvedic Food Principles for Summer**



**1. Select Cooling Foods**



Use foods naturally sweet, bitter, or astringent in nature. These are cooling flavors that calm Pitta and will not warm the body. Use:

 Watermelon, muskmelon, mango, and pomegranate



 Cooling vegetables: bottle gourd, zucchini, and cucumber

 Leafy greens: coriander, mint, and spinach



**2. Stay Naturally Hydrated**



Summer demands water, but Ayurveda does not recommend cold drinks. Drink instead:

 Coconut water



 Infusions like cumin-coriander-fennel (CCF) tea

 Rose petal or mint-flavored water



**3. Reduce Heat-Rising Foods**



Reduce foods that cause internal heat like:

 Spicy food, onions, and garlic



Pickles, fermented foods, and fried foods

 Coffee, alcohol, and highly salty foods



**4. Light & Fresh Meals**



Have light, light-to-digest freshly cooked foods. Whole cereals like rice and barley, mung dal, and steamed greens are best.

At Prayagraj Ayurvedic treatment centers counseling provides relief to most patients of digestive ailments, wherein customized food timetables are planned based on individual dosha imbalance.



**Right Daily Regimen during Summer**



**1. Start Early Morning**



Wake up early in the morning, that is, at 5:30 a.m., and enjoy the quietness and coolness of the early morning.



**2. Follow Cooling Body Care Routine**



**Abhyanga (Oil Massage):** Gently massage with sandalwood or coconut oil may relax the nervous system and hydrate the skin.



**Bathing:** Take a bath using cold or warm water. Rose water or sandalwood powder added to the bathwater gives the natural cooling effect.



**Wear:** Wear light white, blue, or pale-colored loose-fitting garments.



**3. Avoid Overexertion**



Do not exert yourself vigorously or sunbathe between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Slow yoga, swimming, or morning walks early in the morning are ideal. There are even some Ayurvedic hospitals in Prayagraj that have therapeutic yoga classes under well-trained coaches.



**4. Sleep Well**



Short afternoon siesta (20–30 minutes) is invigorating, but too much day sleep upsets the digestion. Evening hours are spent outdoors—take a walk beside a river, stay outdoors in the garden, or gaze at moonlight to gradually shed body heat naturally.



 **Healing Herbs and Therapies**



If there is a more serious disease like joint pain, inflammation, or nervous upset, Ayurveda offers dietary and herbal treatment.



**Amla:** Vitamin C content and cooling



**Aloe Vera Juice:** Purifying and digestive



**Shatavari:** Specifically beneficial for hormonal balancing and cooling the body

In the majority of the Prayagraj Ayurvedic hospitals, these plants are included as part of personalized treatment. These patients who need special care go to a Prayagraj doctor for arthritis, Prayagraj doctor for slip disc, or Prayagraj doctor for cervical and receive diet and lifestyle modification along with natural treatment.



Other neurological disorders such as sciatica or posture disorders are being treated in an Ayurvedic treatment center in Prayagraj, on behalf of a neuro & ortho physician in Prayagraj, with the help of Panchkarma, herbal treatment, and personalized exercises. 



 **Conclusion**



Summer can be celebratory and refreshing—if we sync our life to its rhythm. Ayurveda learning has helped us learn how to stay connected with aware food, cooling treatments, and rest. If you only wish to somehow manage with the heat or deal with misery grievances, there is relief available under[ Naturopathy in Prayagraj](https://prakritivedawellness.com/) and counseling by an adept Ayurvedic treatment centre in Prayagraj.

Visit a trustworthy [**Ayurvedic hospital in Prayagraj**](https://prakritivedawellness.com/) or consult an accredited neuro & ortho physician in Prayagraj to learn how nature's timeless healing system can transform your summer health journey.",1,1750053943.0,u_ayurvedic1234,0,1.0,False

He fed upon the fear he could ignite in others, a peculiar validation for the anxieties that, like phantom limbs, often clawed at his own spirit in the dark.

His latest offering, ""The Man Who Wore My Face,"" had struck a raw nerve. It painted a slow, meticulous invasion by a doppelganger, a parasitic mimicry that began with habits, then voice, and finally, the very topography of the protagonist's flesh. The final, chilling pronouncement, ""I saw him in the mirror this morning, and he smiled back with my teeth,"" had spawned a harvest of skeletal emojis and utterances like ""Absolutely terrifying, felt like I was looking over my own shoulder, into a maw.""

That night, an alien chill slithered over Mark, deeper than any draft from his window. As he performed the ritual of his midnight coffee, he perceived it: the sugar bowl, dislodged from its accustomed sanctuary. A negligible displacement, perhaps, yet it snagged at his perception like a thread drawn taut on a wound. He dismissed it with a shrug, attributing it to the common fugue of his writing jags, a mind untethered from trivialities.

The next morning, his hand sought the familiar comfort of his chipped mug, its faded band logo a topographical map for his thumb. It was gone. In its place, a pristine, unblemished mug gleamed on the drying rack, an anemic luminescence under the harsh kitchen light. A flicker of unease, cold and precise. He abhorred plain mugs; his collection was a chronicle of personal history, each vessel imbued with memory and warmth. This felt alien, a surgical replacement. His search of the cupboards was frantic, a knot of visceral dread tightening in his gut, but the chipped mug had vanished.

In the ensuing days, the intimate, familiar details of his existence began to warp and shift with an unnerving, almost deliberate frequency. The toothpaste, not his preferred brand, but one he actively loathed, its taste a metallic echo on his tongue. His worn armchair, once a haven, bore a new throw pillow he did not recognize, a floral obscenity that shrieked against his minimalist asceticism. The books on his shelf, once meticulously arrayed by genre, now stood in a chaotic, meaningless jumble, ordered only by their indifferent height. Each alteration, isolated, was a trifle, easily dismissed. But the cumulative effect was a rising static in his mind, a constant, low-level hum of wrongness, an insidious hum that resonated like a nerve plucked too often.

He began to scrutinize everything. A book left on his nightstand would migrate to the coffee table, as if by invisible hands. Keys placed in the bowl by the door would manifest in his jacket pocket, a garment he had not touched. He questioned the very integrity of his memory, the fragile edifice of his sanity. Was he sleepwalking, a nocturnal phantom within his own skin? Or simply succumbing to the creeping rot of forgetfulness? The possibilities offered no solace, only deeper fissures.

He attempted to write, to lose himself in the fabricated horrors he could control, but the words were a travesty, stilted, a grotesque imitation of his own unique cadence. He stared into the dark mirror of his laptop screen, searching for some aberration, a tell-tale flaw. His face was... normal. Too normal, perhaps, lacking the familiar etchings of fatigue, the slightly haunted cast that usually shadowed his eyes.

Then came the digital echoes of his own unfolding terror, comments on his story that mirrored the growing disquiet within his apartment walls:

""Dude, this feels so real. Like, uncomfortably real. My skin is crawling.""

""Are you okay, Mark? This one feels... personal. Everything alright? I'm legitimately worried.""

""Getting serious uncanny valley vibes from this. Like it's happening to me. Anyone else feel like they're being watched while reading this?""

He dismissed them as the predictable effusions of readers ensnared by his fiction, their imaginations inflamed. But the feeling persisted. The feeling of being subtly off-key in his own life, a performance where he had forgotten his lines, and the understudy was playing his part with chilling precision.

He started to recoil from mirrors. The brief, involuntary glimpses were sufficient to send a jolt of ice through his veins. He caught his reflection in a shop window and felt a profound sense of detachment, as if the figure staring back was not entirely him, a simulacrum.

One evening, the compulsion became an undeniable, gravitational pull. He stood in his bathroom, the harsh fluorescent light buzzing overhead like an agitated insect, and confronted his reflection. He brushed his teeth, his movements precise, almost ritualistic. He finished, rinsed, and then, as he turned away, he saw it. The reflection in the mirror did not move in perfect concert with him. There was a fractional delay, a tiny, almost imperceptible lag, like a poorly synchronized shadow, or a glitch in the fabric of reality itself.

His blood ran cold, turning to liquid ice in his veins. He moved his hand; the reflection followed, a beat late. He forced a smile, a trembling rictus that felt alien on his own lips. The reflection's smile bloomed a moment later, wider, colder, showing just a little too much tooth, a predatory gleam in the eyes that mimicked his own.

He stumbled back, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs, the toothpaste foam forgotten, a white accusation on his chin. He looked again, blinking rapidly, desperately. The reflection was perfectly synchronized now, his own terrified face staring back, eyes dilated with a dawning, annihilating horror. He must be utterly exhausted. Hallucinating. The stress, a corrosive acid, was eating away at his mind.

He splashed cold water on his face, trying to scrub away the phantom images, to scour his perception clean. He told himself it was nothing, a trick of the light, a tired mind playing its cruel games. He went to bed, but sleep, a mocking whisper, would not come. He lay there, rigid beneath the covers, listening to the sounds of his apartment. The familiar creaks and groans of an old building settling for the long night. But tonight, they were different. Deliberate. Footsteps overhead where there should be none, heavy and rhythmic. A faint scratching, ceaseless, from within the very walls, as if something were trying to claw its way out.

Then, a floorboard groaned just outside his bedroom door. He froze, every muscle tensed, an animal caught in a snare. He lived alone. There was no one else.

Another creak, closer this time. Then another, slow and measured, drawing inexorably towards his door, a morbid procession.

He held his breath, straining his ears, the thunderous rhythm of his own heartbeat deafening in the profound, suffocating silence. The doorknob began to turn, slowly, silently, the metal groaning softly in protest, a whispered lament.

Panic seized him, a cold, suffocating wave that threatened to drown him. He scrambled from the bed, fumbling for his phone on the nightstand. He had to call someone. The police. A friend. Anyone. A voice.

The door opened a crack, revealing a sliver of impenetrable darkness, a cut in the world.

He saw it then. Just a sliver of a face in the gap. It was his face, undeniably his, a grotesque parody. But the eyes were not his. They were too bright, too empty, devoid of any warmth or recognition, like polished obsidian, reflecting nothing but the void.

He backed away until his spine met the cold plaster of the wall, the phone slipping from his trembling, numb fingers to clatter on the floor, a sound swallowed by the encroaching silence. The door opened fully, revealing the figure standing there. It was him, wearing his pajamas, his messy hair, his face.

The figure raised a hand, his hand, and waved slowly, a chillingly casual gesture, like a lover bidding farewell.

Then, it smiled.

And Mark Thorne saw his own teeth smiling back at him from the face of the thing that had taken his place. The feedback loop was complete, closed, sealed. He had written his own nightmare into existence, had given it flesh and breath, and now, it was time for the sequel, a terrifying reality he was trapped in, with no escape, no audience, just the chilling, annihilating knowledge that the man who wore his face was now living his life, and he, Mark Thorne, was merely the discarded husk.",1,1750053860.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Here are other things he's done:

* He helped me tour apartments, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language that well), and used his car to move all my stuff.
* He walked me home on my first night at my new apartment, even though his house is much closer.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo I took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut my steak during a meal after I had just offered him a bite (he cut the whole steak, then took a piece). When a friend pointed out that he's too nice to me, and that's why she thought he likes me, he just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. He also asked who else thinks that he likes me (in our office)
* He pays attention to the things I do or do not like. And he proudly points out that he remembers whenever it's brought up, or tells people (like when I put too much spice on my food, he tells them ""oh she likes spicy food""
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants, and i played along, he got panicked and defensive, and has been getting more embarrassed by small things when his friends point them out in front of me
* When a man stalked me and asked me out in the office, I told him how it made me uncomfortable and explained what happened, so he called the guy a creep and went to look for him to make sure he wasn't around still.
* When his friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at me and smiled, and tilted his head as if asking, ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""

But there are signs he may not like me:

* He’s deflected my invitation to go walk by the river twice, the first time he was hungover and sick, the second time he had to work.
* He’s never taken much initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another time to grab coffee.
* When I offered to accompany him on a long trip (2-3 hours) even though I had a deadline, he said i should probably stay and work. I told him I'm almost finished with my work, but he told me the trip might take longer, so it's okay, and that I should stay back. I feel like sometimes he avoids one-on-one time (could be due to overthinking and his english skills; he did tell me he wants to be more talkative with me in english like he is in his native language with his other friends, thats why he's trying really hard to learn it recently)",1,1750053812.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

So far I think the most advanced accomplishment is >!opening the blue door, and seeing what’s in the three boxes. I’ve noticed the spiral image in the black box, and know of the message hidden in the book on the blueprint image. No idea what to do from there, I’m assuming it’s a “dead end”.!<

Things I have thoughts on are:

Or does anyone have the SUBTLEST of hints to get me to understand this? I just don’t have the brain power right now but don’t want a full spoiler!<
- >!The Clock Tower & The Orindia Clock (where I got the Aries Key). I believe this allows me to use the clock again and again on different days giving me the idea that there’s something more to it. The floor of the clock tower is on the sacred hour, same as the rotating clock. And I’ve noticed the pillars look to be based on the cardinal directions, and the stairs of which there are 113 of (would need to confirm). On the stairs there are darkened steps, much darker than the rest, that give me thoughts about how that might equate to rotating the clock face based on the number of steps, or to where those darkened steps would be when laid over the clock face? Possibly use the directions and the poem at the top? Or the car license plate in the garage? Might be related to cardinal directions?!<
- >!Some of the music sheets and the ballroom hint at some inneclipse interaction after waiting X time and the. Another 24 hours I think? Might have been something I missed at day 46 I think? Not sure if this is still achievable.!<
- >!Safe House, has a board with “we seek what’s in the shade of truth” on it. Is that relevant?
- >!the spiral stars shown at 100. I’m only about 105 right now, is this something that truly unfolds to something else?!<
- >!denotated in verse, does it never end, investors needed. Does this lead anywhere? The picture of the stars in the lady’s chamber, the picture of the “invention”, and the picture of the music note?!<
 - >!Can I use the red crown, the scepter, and the cursed stone to change the blue throne room to the red throne room?!<
- >!I haven’t been able to successfully draft the bedroom where I would dig for treasure. Is this worth doing? I know there’s a puzzle there, but not sure if it leads to anything?!<
- >!”There is a letter missing” from the Pantry blue note. Coffee is missing an E, does that mean anything? Or is it just hinting at the paintings?!<
- >!The Prophecies from Alzara. I was going to go through the videos and piece together ideas, but I’m not sure if where I’m at would lead to anything worth the time?!<
- >!Along with the above, there was a shot of the dark room, drafted into what I think was the nursery? With a specific time on the clock. Does that do anything?!<
- >!I got burned by A New Clue, because I seemed to find answers to things that were hinted at in the book, like the sundial and microchip, that I’m worried about going through the manuscripts I found after completing the natural order. Is there anything REALLY worth finding that I wouldn’t have figured out already by being as far as I am?!<
- >!all these 4x4 grids, the candles in the tomb, the rotating ladder in the boiler room, all of these look like binary grids and give me 4 digits when I pick them apart. Anyone know if that leads anywhere? The Boiler Room one repeats oddly and abruptly.!<

1lclcn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1lclcn1/tired_foggy_and_dehydrated_this_fixed_it_for_me/,"Tired, foggy, and dehydrated? This fixed it for me","I wasn’t looking for a new supplement. I was just frustrated. No matter how much I slept or how healthy I tried to be, I still felt tired, foggy, and drained. I drank tons of water but stayed weirdly dehydrated. Then I came across **Seaonic**, a **natural electrolyte supplement** made from filtered seawater.

At first I thought: no way something this simple could work. But after six weeks of using it, I can say it’s one of the few things I’ve tried that actually made a difference in how I feel.

**So what is Seaonic?**

It’s not a powder or sports drink. It’s a small **liquid sachet** filled with **cold-microfiltered seawater** rich in **78 ionic minerals**. That includes **magnesium**, **potassium**, **sodium**, **zinc**, and a long list of trace elements your body actually needs for **hydration**, **focus**, and **cellular energy**.

There’s no sugar, no sweeteners, no artificial anything. Just natural minerals from the ocean in the same ratios found in human blood plasma.

**Why I gave it a shot**

I was dealing with:

* Constant low energy
* Brain fog
* Digestive issues and bloating
* Feeling dehydrated no matter how much water I drank

After doing some research, I learned that hydration isn’t just about water. Without minerals, water can’t get into your cells properly. It just moves through your system. And modern filtered water and food don’t have the minerals we used to get naturally.

Seaonic claimed to fix that by giving you what your cells need to actually hold onto water.

**What happened after 6 weeks**

**Week 1**: Started with 1 sachet each morning. Tastes salty, but manageable. I didn’t crash mid-afternoon like usual.

**Week 2–3**: Better digestion. Clearer thinking. More stable energy throughout the day. No need for my usual extra coffee.

**Week 4+**: I slept deeper, recovered faster after workouts, and started using a second sachet on long days. No bloating, no headaches, and definitely fewer cravings.

It wasn’t dramatic, just steady, lasting improvement.

**What makes Seaonic different**

Most **electrolyte supplements** include 5–10 minerals, often synthetic and loaded with sugar or “natural” flavors. They’re designed to taste good, not necessarily work well.

Seaonic gives you:

* **78+ minerals in ionic form**
* No sweeteners or additives
* Cold-microfiltered for purity (removes heavy metals and microplastics)
* Already in liquid form, so no mixing or mess

If you want to see what’s in it, I found the product here:

And for the science behind how it supports hydration and detox:  
[**Seaonic Ingredient & Cellular Function Overview**](https://seaonic.com/pages/wds-se-lp?lpid=2574&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1066&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1066&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2574&oid=1066&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**Final verdict**

Seaonic isn’t cheap and it doesn’t taste like fruit punch. But it’s clean, easy to use, and it actually helped me feel like myself again. If you're still tired after doing everything right sleep, water, exercise - it might be because your cells are missing what they need.

Btw parents ng kid is nasa ibang bansa and ik parang thats what my bf could do para sa kapatid nya but i think its too much tipong gusto matulog ni bf or pahinga lang but cant. Sometimes pag andoon ako sakanila nakikita ko talaga tiredness nya. Before, almost everyday andoon ako but rn parang nagsasawa na ako sa routine, routine na whole day hawak mo yung bata and then sa gabi kailangan mo pa mahintay makatulog yung bata bago ka makalipat ng room and keep in mind if I’m not mistaken he’s growing up spoiled tbh Im not into kids especially into spoiled ones. And kasama naman ni bf sa house parents nya and yung kid but ipahawak mo lang saglit yung bata sa iba, ibabalik at ibabalik kay bf, since noong inuwi here yung bata he was the one na lagi nag babantay, keep in mind first year college kami and yung course na tintake ni bf is difficult so gabi nalang talaga binibigay na free time nya makakatulog yung kid mga 9 or 10pm, kaya ang lagi ginagawa nya is madaling araw gumagawa for acads sa sobrang pagod. And to us tbh ayoko isiksik sarili ko sa tiredness ni bf, we dont go out together na kaming dalawa lang, pinupuntahan ako rarely like rare ng gabi but of course I am grateful for that but tbh if nasa age na kami na pwede magsama ni bf and still yung nephew nya is always nasa side I swear I cant bare with it, we have been together for years but whenever or noong wala pa yung kid mahigpit talaga sya pinapalabas I feel sorry for him nga he never even gotten to experience yung teenage dream parang kung tutuusin naging batang ama???There was this time noong magkasama kami sa school and keep in mind may class pa sya in the afternoon, I saw a message from his father na I’m not sure if they saying na uwi na sya or tinatanong if uuwi na ba sya not sure cuz there was no question mark, tho I dont think his father uses punctuations. There was so many times na nap point talaga sakanya ang pag alaga another one na naalala ko was his mother talking to her friend and I was with my bf and bata kararating naming tatlo cuz sinusundo namin mother nya then his mom was like “kita mo bakit pa kailangan kunan ng tagaalaga kung kaya naman pag tulungan” telling her friend while bf was carrying his nephew, I was like sa isip ko MAN what the hell. Despite all these, I love his family and ik they do also but really I just cant help but think its not impossible for my bf na maagang magkasakit dahil sa mga puyat at stress. I really dont know what to say/do. ",6,1750053536.0,adviceph,6,1.0,False

I still remember how much my manager smiled and was excited for me to go into this corporate law firm doing finance cause that’s what I was dying to do. She gave me a gift card for this coffee shop I used to go to a lot and a little card thanking me for my work as I parted ways with them. I wish I could’ve spent more time there as I only stayed for 6 months. Looking back, it was a better job than being in this horrendous corporate environment. My coworkers in higher education were very nice and relaxed people who always helped me without making me feel stupid or throwing condescending comments. They let me be quiet and just do my work. My boss gave me a lot of support and was very very patient with me. She never called me out in front of teammates making me look bad like my current boss does. She was gentle on her feedback and also praised me for my strengths when giving it. Now I’m living in a nightmare surrounded by nasty coworkers and a boss who only praises me when I do a good job and tears me down when I do bad. I feel on edge 24/7 and can’t sleep thinking about work and the stress of it.

I usually just brew with an Aeropress, so a gooseneck isn't necessary. Although I do have V60 which I use occasionally. I am also not planning on going full-fledged coffee aficionado. My budget is around 4-5k right now. To get a better kettle, I will need to wait and save.

The other option is to get Sipologie Precision which is around INR 5700

1lcl1te,https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/1lcl1te/super_duper_long_post_about_my_experience_with/,super duper long post about my experience with SUWS,"Hi all, i went attended SUWS on my 17th birthday in the summer of 2020, which is kinda poetic to me because my old man also attended SUWS on his 17th back when it was in idaho, but i digress. i wasnt really that much of a delinquent before i went, i mean i smoked some weed (which my parents knew about) and did some psychedelics (which they definitely did not know about) but i really got sent there because i got robbed this one time and my dad led a hard life before he sobered up, so that really shook him. i was actually supposed to go to NOLS instead, which ive heard is not really therapy oriented but was more about rock climbing and river rafting and really leaned into the out doors aspect. anyway, that got cancelled because of covid and i was left with SUWS. i went willingly thinking it was a summer camp, and still remember the 3 days notice before my birthday and the intentional lack of clarity as to how long id be gone, and my dad dropping me off after i could barely eat my waffle house last meal and being super nauseous and that cold nervousness early in the morning as we drove up the mountain. i remember my indoc, having change and them making sure i wasnt smuggling heroin or knives, and the only thing i could keep was a pocket edition new testament my grandmother gave me (thank you, it saved my life). i remember after this whole indoc ordeal sitting at home base outside the cabins with the provisional group of kids who wouldnt necessarily go to the same group, and i remember that first bullshit dinner we ate, especially disappointing after a pb tortilla for lunch. i remember a kid who couldnt have been older than 13 being told by the counselors that it was his night to clean the pot, and him telling them to fuck off, and their passive therapy-coded rebuttal. that was my 'im not in kansas anymore' moment. the following couple of days i tried to make it known that 'i think i am in the wrong place, can i call my dad and leave' to which i got the same passively coded 'no' 

so eventually i get out to my group, bravo, which for those uninitiated was from my understanding the older male non addict group, with 'phoenix program' also known as alpha, being older males whos primary concern was drug problems (if i remember correctly, but i cant remember where the female group with drug problems fit in) we werent allowed to talk to girls hardly at all if we came into contact, such as at home base, and its no wonder why. a bunch of young men with clear behavioral issues whove been in the woods for a month? of course they would try something. now before i go further i wanna make something totally clear, as best i can within the guidlines of this sub (mods please read this entire passage before sniping my post). suws wasnt all negative to me, but i would like to make it clear that i attribute basically 0 of the positives i gained from my time in the Pisgah to the institution/organization that runs/ran suws. granted, i havent done too much research into the wider RTC world, aside from what i heard on the inside and broad attitudes from the cursory look at this sub and anecdotes that theres a netflix documentary about the wilderness programs. Id like to preface by saying i do believe there are real people, a lot of people, who have been genuinely hurt by these places, but i would be lying if i didnt say that i believe theres a subset of folks who hate it because they have a wrecked relationship with their parents, and the shock of getting 'gooned' and then being sent to a place that physically demanding and run by a bunch of jaded shrinks also left a bad taste in their mouth so to speak. now, im biased. not to dox myself, but i go to a military college now, so physical fitness, restricted freedom, and getting severely out of my comfort zone is something that is more or less my way of life, and that isnt to brag, but perhaps that could enlighten you to my perspective a bit. ill say this, not having my phone for 2 months as a teenager, especially during the political climate of the 2020 riots and the height of covid, was good for me. it appears i also got pretty lucky with the staff in my group, and ill say that being outside in nature for 2 months (even if pisgah rained on us every fucking day in the month of july) with out any worry about what im gonna eat or wear or anything was also cool. all of my growth came from living in close proximity to a bunch of severely dysfunctional teenagers and figuring out how *not* to kill each other. alright, im done thats all im gonna give those fuckers, back to the testimony (glorious mods pls chill)

alright so i get out to my group after a couple of days at base making sure i wasnt gonna seize up and die from withdrawls, it was bravo group, ages like 13-17 but not specifically drugs more just behavioral stuff. i dunno if this was present in other groups, but we had a system called 'oge to lowge' which was the most 'OG' member or the kid who had been there the longest got first pick on our group carries, and that was vital because the new kids had to handle the shit bucket or the sump back which was heavy as hell. the oge to lowge ranking if i remember it right was this one kid who seemed cool, older, from florida, cuban, long hair, seemed like a chiller, and then there was this effeminate gay fellow, then my bro justin, and then these two kids who got there at around the same time, spencer and lewis. lewis had autism, he was high function but (and i mean this in the least offensive way possible, i have family members who are effected similarly) he was mentally weak so to speak. he wasnt a good hiker, he was heavy set, and he was constantly making the group lag, often time getting us caught in the daily rain. he was nice enough, but he was hand held through the 'rank' system or curriculum, or whatever you wanna call it. he got gradded after 60 days but he hadnt even made rank 3. then there was my bro spencer, i dont wanna dox so ill try to keep a lot of his backstory brief. he was adopted by some rich folks from new england, and a year younger than me. i guess around his 8th grade he developed a substance issue, and he got sent away to some program out west (at suws the understanding was the out west ones were wayyyy worse). the shitty thing is that after he gradded from one, his parents sent the 'goons' (those buff guys who kidnap kids in the night and send the to RTCs) to transport him directly to another, from wilderness camp to mental hospital to boarding school and so on and so fourth, i reckon for non compliance or whatever. he told me he got into a lot of fights. this went on until i met him, which wouldve been the summer before his junior year of highschool. he hadnt been home, and had only seen his parents for one night in a hotel room in all of that time. how that is remotely legal i havent the slightest clue, but one can imagine how that could make him go sort of stir crazy. he was always sorta antsy, but strangely at peace, like he knew he was going home any time soon, had seen it all before, and didnt give a fuck about the system. i motivated him to work the system seriously, if anything to prove to the man and to his folks that he had calmed down enough to go home. he did, and they still sent him somewhere else when he gradded. he added me on snap some years later (fuck HIPPA) and we caught up but we have since lost contact. hope he is well.

as reported, quality of life aint great, and i think that, while that may not be the point, it kinda works. breakfast was always oats, with brown sugar and cinnemon to taste, and lunch was from your own p (personal?) bag, which had a jar of peanut butter, a stick of pepperoni, a single packet of tuna, 'salties' (pretzels goldfish and some other shit mixed) a block of cheese, some sauce packets, a hot cocoa pack, a pack of tortillas, and some cheese sticks and granola bars. ill never forget burning the whole pack of tuna, some pep stick, some cheese, salties, mayo and mustard on a tortilla on a Wednesday (our re sup day) and thinking it was the most gourmet shit ever. dinner was always a combo of lentils, beans and rice with various seasonings to taste, (FUCK LENTILS UNTIL I DIE) but we also got mac and cheese enough for one day, which we always sent on the start of our week, which was Wednesday. kids would give up portions of their cheese block to go with the powdered 'space cheese', season with some chilli powder. not horrible. showers were like once a week ish, same with laundry i think. they expected us to take 'billy baths', aka go behind the tarp where the shitter is and pour cold water on yourself with these shitty rusted tin coffee cans. fuck that. i no one did it, but i never noticed a real stench, even if we missed a weekly shower, maybe i went nose blind or the natural ecosystem under your pits levels out after some time. clothes sucked and they always got pissed when we tore the sleeves off to make cut outs, but there wasnt shit they could do to us. it seemed like the institution had seen all of the negative press and there was heavy orders from on high to be as PG as possible. if you went off into the woods to piss you had to beep really loud so they know you didnt run off or throw yourself down a cliff or something. we all basically obeyed though, partially from the shell shock of being somewhere unfamiliar, and even more so because of the threat of more time. after a while you come to realize you can kinda say whatever, but theyd always scold you with, ""y'know \[insert name\], youre only adding more time to your stay here"", which in retrospect was bullshit, unless your parents were loaded, but nevertheless that motivated the hell outta me. still though, we didnt have any major incidents and my main priority became making sure the day to day ran as smoothly and efficiently as possible. 

shrinks came once a week. they'd sit down, each one having a kid or two to talk to, on their stupid fucking matt, and act like they knew you. i hated mine. i was closed off as a clam and didnt wanna talk about shit. they picked up on it real quick, and made quick work of psychologically dissecting me and basically manipulating me into talking. thats when i realized id have to play ball if i was gonna leave. i hated to admit that, i hated the surrender, i hated the vulnerability, it felt like emotional molestation. maybe it was best for me down the line. fuck em. im not giving that to them. the ranking system looked like this: you had a little booklet (still have mine and its actually empty because the main one got destroyed, i can post pics if yall want) and in it you had assignments, read X chapter in the big book of AA, and then each phase had a hard skill. start a fire, make some traps, etc. then you could level up. if your parents had some money they could get you a 'brain scan' as we called it, and from what i understand you were taken away from the group for a lil while, go back to home base and theyd hook you up to those synapse readers like 11 had in stranger things, and you would watch forrest gump (apparently this is because the movie has a little bit of every emotion in it) and this guy would read your brain signals and draft up this entire paper about your entire psychology. i ran into this fella before, i cant remember his name but he was wicked smart. tall and built with a beard, but still had this asheville hippie vibe to him. i think he was like a doctor of neuro psychology or something, he was the only guy who did what he did, so im sure his info is a matter of record. any who, we had gotten this new kid, cool enough guy from up north who was like a competitive smash bros player, and after some time he had gotten the brain scan done. i remember him coming back to us all normal and chill, and then while we are all eating dinner and having a good evening this fella, the psych fella, comes lumbering in from nowhere and it starts raining. in front of all of us, he disects this kids entire personality, his insecurities, his troubles with his parents, everything in front of all of us, things this kid probably didnt know him self, and i mean this kid completely breaks down into tears. we got coralled away and the old fella gave this kid a hug and they talked. to this day it was one of the coldest, cruelest, most calculating show of intellect i had ever witnessed. i think about it quite a bit. 

alright. its getting late where i am and this is long enough so i think ill call it. ill post this, and if it doesnt get taken down and/or people seem interest in my testimony ill add in the rest. ive probably got another post as big as this worth of material, so let me know if yall care at all, also, as stated above i have my old notebook from the joint thats basically empty, if anyone is interested.",2,1750052524.0,troubledteens,0,1.0,False

""I want cold water. Tell the guards to have Olivia bring it in.","# From the First Page to the Final Blow—Complete Recap, Reaction & Reading Access

""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.



I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""



""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""



""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder—did he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere—every inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe… maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia—to the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room—broken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window—the sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.

I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.

""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.

Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.

""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or…"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.

I quickly shook my head.

She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""

Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.

""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""

I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.

""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""

A dark hunger stirred inside me—the need to lose myself, to forget everything—even if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.

Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted—what I needed—and she was more than willing to give it to me.

I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.

""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.

I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.

Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.

That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.

I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.

She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.

But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.

She moaned, her fingers gripping the sheets. ""Please, Master,"" she gasped. ""I need you.""

That was all I needed.

With one hard thrust, I slammed into her, making her cry out. I didn't give her time to adjust—I didn't want to. I set a brutal pace from the start, pounding into her relentlessly. The bed frame creaked beneath us, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.

Anita moaned loudly, her body rocking forward with every thrust, but I pulled her back against me, keeping her exactly where I wanted. My grip on her hips was bruising, my nails digging into her flesh as I took her hard and rough, just the way I needed.

""Who do you belong to?"" I growled, yanking her head back again.



""You, Lennox,"" she panted, her voice breaking with pleasure. ""Only you.""

I smirked darkly. ""Damn right.""

I released her hair and pressed her chest down onto the mattress, driving deeper into her. My control was slipping, my wolf growling as I fucked her like an animal.

She was screaming now, her body shuddering beneath me, but I didn't stop. I couldn't stop. Not until I had taken everything I wanted from her.

And I wasn't done yet

Anita's body trembled beneath me, her moans filling the room as I drove into her relentlessly. But no matter how hard I took her, no matter how much she screamed my name, it wasn't enough.



Because it wasn't her.

I clenched my jaw, trying to push the thought away, but it was useless. My mind betrayed me, painting a different picture. It wasn't Anita's dark hair spilling over her shoulders—it was Olivia's. It wasn't Anita's moans filling my ears—it was Olivia's breathless whimpers, the way I knew she'd sound if I ever had her like this.

""Lennox…"" Anita gasped, her voice breaking with pleasure as she arched her back, pressing against me. But for a moment, I didn't hear Anita. I heard Olivia.



A violent need surged through me. I pulled out of her suddenly, making her whimper at the loss. Before she could protest, I flipped onto my back and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her over me.

""Ride me,"" I ordered, my voice rough with need.

Anita grinned, straddling me eagerly. She reached down, positioning herself before sinking onto my cock with a moan. Her head fell back, her nails digging into my chest as she took me deep.

I gritted my teeth, my hands gripping her hips tightly as she began to move. But I wasn't watching Anita anymore.

I was watching Olivia.

In my mind, it was her above me, her red lips parted in breathless pleasure. It was her soft skin beneath my hands, her tight pussy wrapped around me.



""Fuck,"" I growled, my grip tightening. I drove my hips up hard, making Anita cry out. But all I saw was Olivia.



How would she look like this? Would she be shy? Would she try to fight the pleasure, or would she surrender to it completely?



I imagined her whimpering my name, her nails dragging down my chest as she came apart for me.



A low, possessive growl rumbled from my chest. Olivia wasn't supposed to be in my head like this. She wasn't supposed to be the one I craved. I hated her. She had hurt me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.



And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many times I fucked Anita or anyone else, no one could take her place.



Anita's pace quickened, her nails scraping against my chest as she rode me harder, chasing her release. My grip on her hips was firm, guiding her movements, but my mind was elsewhere.



Not here. Not with her.



With Olivia.



I could almost see her—imagine the way her body would tremble above me, the way her lips would part in a gasp as she took me deep. My control slipped at the thought, my grip tightening as I thrust up into Anita with brutal force.



""Lennox—"" Anita gasped, her body tensing. She was close.



I was too.



With one last punishing thrust, I sent her over the edge. Her body clenched around me as she cried out, shuddering in pleasure. The sensation pushed me past my limit, and with a low growl, I let go.



Pleasure ripped through me, my release spilling into the condom as I buried myself deep inside her. My breathing was heavy, my chest rising and falling as I rode out the aftershocks.



For a brief moment, silence filled the room, broken only by Anita's soft panting.



Then, without a word, I reached down and pulled out of her. My body was still humming with satisfaction, but the moment was already fading.



Because it wasn't Olivia.



It never was.



Anita stretched beside me, her fingers lazily trailing down my chest. ""Damn, that was hot,"" she breathed.



I didn't respond. Instead, I reached over and pulled her into my arms. For a moment, we didn't say a word until the door opened and Levi and Louis walked in.



""So you two were having fun without us,"" Louis said, and Anita, loving the attention, giggled softly.



""Move away, Lennox,"" Levi grumbled.



I sighed and rolled out of bed as Levi and Louis positioned themselves beside Anita, wasting no time before devouring her like hungry animals.



I moved away from the bed, walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. As I stood under the cold water, I could still hear the muffled moans coming from my room.



My brothers and I did practically everything together. We shared everything—so sharing Anita, or any other woman, was nothing new. But we also competed against each other.



Who was the best fighter.

The strongest wolf.

The fastest shifter.



Sometimes, it even came down to who fucked better. Who Anita enjoyed more.



And most importantly—who would end up being her mate.



We all knew that on her eighteenth birthday, she would be mated to one of us. And if fate was cruel enough, to all three of us.



And whoever she was mated to would be Dad's favorite. The pack's favored Alpha.



So, in a way, we were all competing for her.



But that didn't mean we didn't love each other.



Sighing heavily, I thought of Olivia, of the good memories I had of her. Of how I fell in love with her even as just a little boy of twelve. How I competed with my brothers, assuming they liked her too.



As we grew older, I thought she liked me too.



But I was wrong. So damn wrong.



Turning off the shower, I tied a towel around my waist and walked back into the room.



Back in my room, I found Levi and Louis fucking Anita dominantly. She was on her knees, Levi's cock in her mouth while Louis fucked her from behind.



Their moans filled the air, but I ignored them, walking over to grab a pair of simple track pants. I needed a run. I needed to clear my head.



I pulled them on and left the room without another word.



But just as I stepped into the hallway, a female servant rushed up to me, looking panicked.



""Young master, Olivia just fainted on the rooftop,"" she announced, her voice trembling.



My breath caught. Panic surged through me, but I forced myself to stay composed.



""Then wake her up and send her back in,"" I said, sounding nonchalant as I hid my worry.



""That's the problem,"" the servant insisted.

""We've tried waking her, but she's not responding.""



I furrowed my brow, my frown deepening. ""What do you mean?""



She swallowed hard, her eyes wide with fear. ""She's not breathing.""



...

Lennox's POV



I could feel my heart racing in my chest as I followed the maid leading me to Olivia's quarters. I wanted to act nonchalant, like I didn't care, but I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't hide the worry etched on my face.



Stepping into the room, I was met with the sight of Olivia lying lifeless on her bed. Her mother knelt beside her, crying uncontrollably, while a medicine woman attended to her. The moment my eyes landed on Olivia's pale, unmoving form, pain racked my entire body. My breath caught in my throat, and I pushed myself forward to the bed.



""Why isn't she breathing?"" I asked, my voice trembling.



Her mother, wailing in anguish, stood up from the floor and rushed at me. Before I could react, her hands gripped my collar, and she yanked me down to her level, glaring at me with pain and hate burning in her eyes.



""Are you and your brothers satisfied now?"" she spat, her voice dripping with pain. ""Come, eat her dead body!""



I swallowed hard, unable to say a word as guilt clawed at my chest.



Her grip tightened as fresh tears streamed down her face. ""How can you and your brothers hate Olivia this much?"" she demanded, her voice cracking. ""You used to adore her! When you were children, she was your world. She worshiped you, followed you everywhere. She would have given anything for you three. And you? You protected her. Cherished her.""



Her voice dropped to a whisper, filled with agony. ""But now? Now you despise her. Why? Because her father was accused of stealing? Because she's an omega? Because she's no longer the daughter of a gamma?""



My throat tightened as I swallowed the lump forming there. Tears burned at the edges of my eyes, and before I could stop them, they slipped down my cheeks.



That wasn't why I hated her.



Maybe my brothers had their reasons, their own twisted justifications for turning their backs on her, but me? My reason was different. A selfish, painful truth I could never bring myself to say aloud.



Another tear slipped down my cheek, and I turned my head away in shame.



Then—



A sudden, small sound filled the room.



A sneeze.



I jerked my head back toward Olivia, my heart leaping into my throat. The medicine woman gasped, and her mother froze, her breath hitching.



Another sneeze.



And then, Olivia stirred.



With a racing heart and tear-filled eyes, I watched as she slowly opened her eyes. Her mother, who still had her hands on my collar, let go of me and crawled over to Olivia, who had regained consciousness.



Not wanting her to see me in tears, I turned around and left the room. I changed my mind and didn't go for the run anymore. Instead, I went back to my room and found Anita, Levi, and Louis on the bed. Louis and Levi were awake, lying beside an exhausted, sleeping Anita.



The second my brothers saw me, they knew something was wrong.



""Lennox?"" Levi's voice was laced with concern as he sat up, reaching for his underwear.



I ran a hand through my hair, exhaling shakily as I shut the door behind me. My chest still felt tight, my emotions all over the place. Levi's concerned gaze stayed locked on me while Louis sat up, rubbing his face tiredly.



""Lennox?"" Levi asked again, his voice laced with worry. ""What happened?""



I wanted to brush him off, pretend everything was fine, but I couldn't. The image of Olivia lying there, motionless, haunted me. Her mother's words echoed in my mind.



Are you and your brothers satisfied now?



I let out a dry chuckle, shaking my head. Satisfied? No. I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of something I couldn't even put into words.



""She almost died,"" I finally muttered, my voice hoarse.



Louis sat up straighter, frowning. ""Who?""



I swallowed hard. ""Olivia.""



Levi and Louis both froze. The silence that followed was thick, suffocating. I could see the way Levi's jaw tightened, his eyes filled with fear and worry, no matter how hard he tried to hide it. Louis, usually the more composed one, exhaled sharply.



""What do you mean she almost died?"" Louis finally asked, his voice controlled, but I could hear the tension in it.



""She wasn't breathing,"" I admitted, my throat tightening again. ""She looked—"" I stopped, shaking my head. I couldn't say it. I wouldn't. ""Her mother… she lost it. She blamed us.""



Levi scoffed, running a hand through his hair. ""Of course, she did.""



""She's not wrong,"" I bit out, surprising even myself. Levi's eyes snapped to mine, and for a moment, neither of us spoke.



Louis exhaled slowly, swinging his legs off the bed. ""And now?""



""She woke up,"" I said, glancing away. ""I left before she saw me.""



Levi narrowed his eyes at me. ""Why?""



I clenched my jaw. ""Because I didn't want her to see me.""



Louis stood, stretching before running a hand down his face. ""You're acting like this because you still care.""



I let out a bitter laugh. ""Care?"" I repeated, shaking my head. ""I hate her.""

If you do not have one, I highly suggest you get one. These water bottles are so worth it. If you are looking for a good deal on a cirkul, I would highly go to Amazon because their water bottle with two different kinds of flavors which is a [starter kit](https://amzn.to/409jOWv).

These are cheaper than going to Walmart because it costed about $20 dollars. There are different kinds of flavors you can get from iced coffee, [lemonades](https://amzn.to/43IhVCu), [Tea](https://amzn.to/43IhVCu) and other flavors. My favorite flavor is [Honey Crisp Apple](https://amzn.to/440SKdn) because it actually tastes like apples. It is cheap to buy bundles then it is buying singles to me. Bundles allows me to have different flavors.

These pods can last up to 2 weeks but its recommended that you use them within 10 days after opening.

If the flavor is to strong, you can adjust the level so that the flavor gets countered by water and allows you to tone it down.

If you need a stand for your carts, you can get one [here](https://amzn.to/406VBA2)! This one holds 4 at a time.

I love the Crikul because it allows me to just pop the pod in and go and I do not have to mix or shake it like I do with drink mixes and I don’t make a mess with it because the bottle is spill proof. They also make different sizes just case you are like me and have a little one that enjoys taking your cups and bottles. This also allows kids to drink water more because the flavor you does not allow you to think to it is water.

1lcl05y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1lcl05y/midnight_in_the_fog/,Midnight in the fog,"Her old alarm clock was flashing 12:03 AM when Mira finally looked up from the laptop screen. Her neck hurt from hours of bent typing, and her third cup of coffee had long since turned cold at eleven. She smacked grit into her eyes and arched back, listening to the joints crack.

Her small studio flat seemed smaller at night. Her radiator creaked sporadically—a noise she'd become used to in six months here. Below her fifth-floor window, San Francisco's fog swirled in configurations, obscuring the city noise.



Her phone throbbed next to her laptop. A text from an unfamiliar number: ""I see you're awake.""

Mira scowled, thinking it was a wrong number. She got those from time to time—random numbers getting texted by people after they'd gone out drinking. She'd almost set it aside, but the time stamp was exactly midnight.

""Who's this?"" she replied, then blushingly laughed. Most likely some drunkard.

She attempted to go back to her Bay Area urban legends blog entry, but the words refused to flow. Her mind drifted back to the text, when it was done, the orchestration of it all. She looked over towards the window and wondered if anyone on the street below could see into her apartment across the way.



Her phone vibrated again. ""You write of the monsters that fill the night. But do you believe?

Her gut hit the floor. This was not a wrong number. Someone had found her blog. She'd opened only three months ago—not yet established, with a short bio: ""Mira writes about the unexplained.""

She went to her window, leaning her face against the chill of the glass. The fog rolled so heavy she couldn't make out the streetlights below. Her own face stared back at her—rumpled brown hair, dark circles under her eyes, her grandfather's old Berkeley sweatshirt loose around her shoulders.

Her rational brain took over. Someone had discovered her blog, perhaps tracked the place she was from initially from her local news. Creepy but feasible. She reprimanded herself mentally to be more vigilant with personal information.

Her phone flashed again: ""Look behind you.""

Her hands trembled to read the message. How could anyone possibly know that she was by the window? She was in the fifth-floor apartment, and there weren't clear line-of-sight from other buildings.

She turned deliberately, thudding heart. On the black face of her computer screen, she saw her own face—and for an instant, her face was mirrored there, another face as white as hers. But when she blinked again, only her pale face stared back.

Fog rolled up against the windows. A door slammed somewhere behind one of them. Mira scooped up her phone and did what any sane human being would at 12:15 AM when freaking out—called her sister.

""Emma? I know it's late, but—""

""Mira? What's wrong? You sound frightened.""

As she outlined the books and the quantity that she believed she had seen, Mira caught something that frightened her more than any horror tale: the rational world that she had always assumed existed suddenly seemed less substantial than it had mere sixty minutes before.

So I have a friend I'm really into (maybe too much), but I need a stable, objective third-party opinion, and I can't tell my friends or family any of this.

We met in September, but became better friends in January and have been getting closer since then.

Last night was especially interesting; he never talked about his dad before. But last night he told me all about him (while intoxicated), and how he was estranged from him, and his dad's recent death. He was very vulnerable. I'm glad he trusted me with it. i had no idea about any of it

Here are other things he's done:

* I notice he looks at me a lot when we're in a group, even when I'm not talking
* He helped me tour apartments, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language that well), and used his car to move all my stuff.
* He walked me home on my first night at my new apartment, even though his house is much closer.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo I took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut my steak during a meal after I had just offered him a bite (he cut the whole steak, then took a piece). When a friend pointed out that he's too nice to me, and that's why she thought he likes me, he just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. He also asked who else thinks that he likes me (in our office)
* He pays attention to the things I do or do not like. And he proudly points out that he remembers whenever it's brought up, or tells people (like when I put too much spice on my food, he tells them ""oh she likes spicy food""
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants, and i played along, he got panicked and defensive, and has been getting more embarrassed by small things when his friends point them out in front of me
* When a man stalked me and asked me out in the office, I told him how it made me uncomfortable and explained what happened, so he called the guy a creep and went to look for him to make sure he wasn't around still.
* When his friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at me and smiled, and tilted his head as if asking, ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""

But there are signs he may not like me:

* He’s deflected my invitation to go walk by the river twice, the first time he was hungover and sick, the second time he had to work.
* He’s never taken much initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another time to grab coffee.
* When I offered to accompany him on a long trip (2-3 hours) even though I had a deadline, he said i should probably stay and work. I told him I'm almost finished with my work, but he told me the trip might take longer, so it's okay, and that I should stay back. I feel like sometimes he avoids one-on-one time (could be due to overthinking and his english skills; he did tell me he wants to be more talkative with me in english like he is in his native language with his other friends, thats why he's trying really hard to learn it recently)",1,1750052360.0,SeriousConversation,7,0.57,False
1lckzq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stalking/comments/1lckzq9/dont_know_what_to_do_about_this_guy/,Don't know what to do about this guy,"Hi everyone, I need some help in dealing with a stalker.

Back story: in 2009 when I was 21 he showed up at my kickboxing club and asked me on a date. I liked someone else but I said yes because I was lonely. We went on 2 dates, kissed on one, never slept together, that was it. I found him a bit weird but he was friendly enough. I moved away so broke it off. 

In 2010 he moved to my city and sent me a message saying lets catch up. I was seeing someone else but he didn't mind, we went out for coffee. Then he moved away.

In 2016 I was back living in the kickboxing club town eating dinner with my parents at a pub. He walks past the window of the pub, sees me, then comes into the pub. He just sits down at our table while we were eating, and asks for my number again. I was single and in a pretty bad place in my life so I thought why not, things could've changed since 2010 and I didn't have any other dating prospects. I thought it was weird but ignored it. We meet up on 3 occasions, where literally this is all that happened:

1. We go to the art gallery and get lunch

2. We go to a car show where he gets angry at me for eating a medium chips when he got a small chips, so he buys extra chips, then gets angry at me for him feeling sick for eating too many chips. After, I chat to an elderly gent about his old Rover becasue my Uncle used to have one similar. He gets angry and jealous and accuses me of flirting and trying to sleep with the gent!



3. We go to the local pool for a swim seeing we were both into swimming. I show him an injury on my hand. Later he says he loved holding hands by the pool (we didn't hold hands!). he also says he wants kids soon and things got too weird. 

Soon after, he figures out where I live and starts coming to my place unannounced as soon as I arrive home from work. I started going on walks once I got home to avoid him, then he started driving around the streets to find me. After this I tell him I'm not interested in dating or seeing him again. He flips out initially but is ok. Then he wants to catch up again but says just as friends, so I stupidly do that. We go to a pub and we're just chatting and I bring up that I've found out I'm gay (brought up conservative so it took a long time for me to come to terms). He flips out. 

I just stop seeing him after this but we live in a small town. Fast forward to 2023 and I went back to study so I started using the town library because my wifi is bad at home. He started appearing at the library every now and then, and he would come over and say hi, so I'd say hi, then he'd leave. Then it became every time I went to the library he would be there, so I mixed up what days I'd go. He stopped saying hi and started just sitting somewhere nearby and watching me while pretending to read. I would normally move and he wouldn't follow.

Today was the final straw. As soon as I walked into the library he appeared and sat in a pretty public area and he sat directly opposite me but said nothing, just pretended he was chilling and reading a book. I moved to a different floor, then a few minutes later, I noticed he was sitting to my side, watching me. I left. I hate it so much, I feel like prey.

Tl;dr: my stalker now follows me around the library and I don't know what to do.

1lckvur,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lckvur/am_i_overreacting_for_supporting_my_friend_while/,Am I overreacting for supporting my friend while her mother is in the ICU instead of staying home with my BF.,"Okay before we get started, this is a throw away account. All names will be changed as this has just happened, and I am a little heated about it. 

So, this past Friday my friend, Jesse (F 27) called me (F 23) crying hysterically because her mother was in the ICU for the second time this month (her mother lives 5 hours away and they have a pretty close relationship.). Jesse asked if I would be able to come and stay with her for a couple of hours to support her because she was unable to drive to her mother at that point in time. I told her that I would be there for her no matter what. I then texted my bf, Harry (M 28), if he would be able to watch the dogs because I needed to head over to Jesse's house after work (Harry and I live together).

A little backstory on Jesse and Harry because it is needed for the context of this post. Harry and Jesse were -together- before Harry and I met. It was a messy break up, both accusing the other of things, spreading gossip and all that. They eventually made up and were friends with each other inviting each other to different holidays and what not. This is how I met Harry, at one of Jesse's friends-giving parties. We met at the party but did not talk much. A couple weeks after the party, Jesse set up a blind double movie date and invited Harry to be my date. After this Harry and I were practically inseparable. Since we started dating Harry has had a grudge against Jesse, at first, they were cordial with each other but for the past year he gets upset if I even bring up her name. 

Okay now back to the issue at hand. When Harry texted back, he said he didn't really want to watch the dogs. I told him okay and found a way to head over to Jesse's house while having the dogs be taken care of. After this I texted him and told him that after I got off of work at 10:30PM I wanted to -do the deed- with him before I leave and that I would be home around 2:00AM (my normal bedtime as I work 2nd shift hours). He texted back saying ""so I spend the night alone so you can go and be with Jesse and you want to wake me up at 3:00AM to -do the deed-, cool."" I texted Harry back and said not to twist my words and that I was thinking about his schedule (as he usually goes to bed around 11:00PM on Fridays). I then proceeded to blow up on him. Yes, I know this probably wasn't the right thing to do but I got tired of him always criticizing me for being friends with her. Besides hindsight is a b word. During my blow up with Harry, I remind him that he does this will all of my friends (in reality I only have 2 friends that I talk with somewhat frequently). He tried to say that he didn't but further down the text chain he admits to this. He then says ""do what you gotta do"" and continues to answer my texts with single sentence answers. I was fed up at this point.

Needless to say, I went over to support Jesse on Friday night as I already had the dogs being taken care of and did not need to worry about them. I also went over straight after work. Once I got there, I took care of her while she was a nervous wreck. I fed her, cleaned her house, fed her dogs, and sat and talked with her to try and distract her for a little while. It worked and she fell asleep around 1:00AM. I was home by 1:45PM. When I got home, I was shocked to find that Harry was awake and watching something on his TV. I tried to say ""Hi, I'm home"" to him at least 5 different times before I gave up and went to take a shower. After my shower I went in and saw that he had just laid down to go to bed. I told him I was home and asked him why he was mad at me. He said ""You know why."" I then said okay, we can talk about this tomorrow and told him I love you and waited for a reply. All I got was "" I am too mad at you to say it back."" I then went to my room to calm down from the day and say Hi to my pups. 

The next day, I was still pretty heated from the conversations with Harry the day before, so I took both of my pups for separate runs. I still was pretty mad so I ended up going on another run; I did not know that I was going to end up a couple miles from my house but I did. I couldn't make it back to the house as I did not have any water and it was getting to be about 90 degrees F outside. I ended up having to call Harry to come and get me as I needed water and there was nothing but fields and farmland around me, and I did not have my wallet. He said he would come and get me. At this point it was about 11:00AM. I had been away from the house for about 4 hours after all of the runs. He did not ask once where I was or where I went. On the car ride home, I tried to talk to him and ask him how he slept, did he already have breakfast, etc. you know the normal morning conversation. He didn't reply, just drove home in silence. 

At home he spent most of the day not talking, touching, or looking at me which was out of the norm for him. As the day progressed I was cleaning the house top to bottom as my parents were coming over the next day for father's day. It was about 4:00PM when he wanted to go to a couple different stores (Arc, Kohls, and Walmart). We ended up spending a couple hours out of the house, but the vibes were off and he said very little while we were together. I brushed it off as just thinking about it would send me into an over thinking spiral. That night, I made dinner, baked chicken, chili, rice, and peas. Nothing was said at dinner, all he did was watch videos on his phone. No thank you or anything like that. He just sat and ate. He then went to his room and proceeded to try and go to bed. I then asked him why doesn't he sleep in my room as we haven't been able to spend time together since last weekend. He said he was good and didn't want to. I told him fine. I said I love you; he still didn't say it back. I went to bed with my pups. 

Okay so today is Sunday. I slept in today and woke up at 9:00AM. I went downstairs to get my coffee started and realized that Harry was not home. I didn't know where he was, so I texted him and asked him. I did not get a response from him. He ended up coming home around 11:30AM. Told me he went to breakfast with his dad and now he was on his way to his friend's house to help him move some things around. I said okay and walked backup stairs as I wanted to work on my courses some more. I reminded him that my parents were going to be here in a couple hours and that the ribs would need to be started before they got here. He agreed to make the ribs a week before when the plans were made. Needless to say, he came back home 15 minutes before my parents arrived. The ribs were not on the smoker, and I did not know how to work it. I had to quickly shift plans and make burgers and the main dish instead of the ribs. While my parents were at the house, my mother even picked up on his attitude and asked me about it. I told her and she said he ""needed to get over it.""  So tonight, I confronted him about his attitude and actions. He told me that he was still upset over the fact I went to go support my friend on Friday. I asked him why he was so upset about me hanging out with Jesse. All he could say is that she was unpredictable and unresponsible. I asked him how that affected me as a person and Harry couldn't come up with an answer. I then reminded him that I only have Jesse to talk to because my other friend I am not that close with. He said that I shouldn't be friends with her because they have a past together. I asked if he could just be cordial with Jesse but he kept insisting that I had to make it up to him for hanging out with her and that I shouldn't be friends with her. I asked him if he just wanted me to become a recluse and only talk to him and my parents and he could not come up with an answer. I then went to my room for the rest of the night stewing. 

I didn't know what to do after this so, I came here to write this post and see what other's thought of the situation. So am I overreacting for supporting Jesse while her mom was in the ICU?",2,1750051905.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I hate being on here again. But times are tight still, I really just need to find a second job at this point. 

I had $75 in my account for groceries to last to next Friday, but woke up to find PGE automatically went through for $117 and  over drafted me, charging me an additional “courtesy payment fee” of $30 (despite that I’ve requested for overdraft to be removed with my bank NUMEROUS times now, apparently ACH auto payments will still process, just not debit payments) so now, I’m sitting here with -$72 in my account. JOY. So, i really only need $75, however, that won’t really do much other than put my account back in the positive, leaving me screwed for groceries. 

Grateful bills are paid, but having no milk, bread, meat for the kids or coffee beans to get me through the mornings at work is gunna make for a long week. I CAN go to a food pantry, but they typically don’t help with stuff like milk and meat, which is really what I’m needing

If anyone can help, I’d really appreciate it. I get paid next Friday (7/21/23) and can pay back up to an additional $25 at $175 if needed. My paychecks hit my account around 3pm PST so, would be paying back in the afternoon",1,1750051826.0,borrowdeletes,1,1.0,False
1lcku6f,https://form.jotform.com/sammamish/TC-DSEISandPlan,🔺Sammamish Biz Showdown: Who’s Left Standing?,"As Local Businesses Battle to Stay Afloat, Will the New Town Center Just Become a Ghost Town?

(It’s a long one — but hopefully a thought-provoking one too)

The ambitious plan to introduce an additional 400,000 square feet of retail space, along with the additional 2000+ units, in Sammamish's Town Center has sparked considerable debate about its viability and potential impact on the community. Mayor Karen Howe has expressed reservations about the sustainability of such extensive retail development. She suggested that for these new buildings to be profitable, the ground-floor spaces ideally would serve as residential units, to be converted into commercial spaces as demand arises. This approach indicates a cautious outlook on the immediate success of new businesses in the area—so cautious, in fact, that it seems even the city council isn’t convinced they’ll survive.

A significant concern is the control exerted by a single retail rental agency over many of Sammamish's shopping centers. Historically, high rental rates set by this agency have been a contributing factor to the closure of numerous businesses, rendering operations unprofitable. Proponents of the new Town Center retail space argue that introducing competition could lead to more competitive rental rates. However, Mayor Howe has pointed out that once the property is sold to developers, the city has no jurisdiction over future rent pricing, leaving the outcome uncertain. In other words, we’re taking a “build it and they might come… but also might not” approach.

And here’s a key point: once the developer is approved to build the extra retail, they’re likely going to build it — regardless of whether the demand is there or not. As the council has said multiple times, they will have *no say* at that stage. If demand doesn’t show up, the city will be left with vacant storefronts — not increased tax revenue.

Parking provisions further complicate the Town Center development plans. Current legislation mandates that each residential unit be allocated only 1.5 parking spaces. The assumption appears to be that residents will rely less on personal vehicles, opting instead for biking or owning fewer cars. Yet, the majority city council's consideration to extend public parking to 24-hour availability suggests an anticipation of higher parking demand by residents of the Town Center. This disconnect will soon be put to the test when the much-loved Ace Hardware reopens in a location with limited parking. It raises serious questions about where visitors and non-resident shoppers will park—potentially limiting the accessibility and appeal of the retail spaces to only those within walking or biking distance.

Additionally, there are no current plans to attract large box retailers to the Town Center, as Sammamish is not considered a profitable market for such businesses. While there may be a desire for their presence, these retailers are choosing not to come here. Their absence could affect the diversity and appeal of retail offerings, potentially resulting in vacant storefronts and underutilized spaces.

In light of these factors, the envisioned Town Center risks evolving into a predominantly residential area with ample green spaces and towering structures but lacking a vibrant retail scene. The combination of high rental rates, limited parking, and the absence of major retailers poses significant challenges to the survival and prosperity of new businesses in Sammamish's evolving landscape. It may be wise to stick with the currently planned retail space in the new Town Center and see how it performs before adding more — especially when demand and viability remain uncertain. If things go south, we might be looking at more luxury apartments, plenty of lovely sidewalks, and a sea of “For Lease” signs.

  
A Fond Farewell to Sammamish’s Beloved Businesses

Over the years, Sammamish has seen many beloved businesses come and go. Some left lasting impressions, while others quietly disappeared, fading into memory. As we reflect on these places, we remember not just the businesses but the people, the experiences, and the moments that made them special.

Recently joining the list of businesses that have closed is Petco in Sammamish Highlands. It’s closure is a reminder of how quickly our local shopping centers change.

Here’s a standout selection of a few favorites that left their mark:

·       7-Eleven – A convenient stop for a drink or snack, a last-minute ingredient, or a fun free treat on 7-11 Slurpee Day. Many remember popping in while walking along the Sammamish Trail or grabbing a quick bite before heading out on an adventure.

·       Party Carousel – A magical store filled with unique gifts, party supplies, and special finds. It was the perfect place to pick out that one-of-a-kind birthday present or grab decorations for a celebration.

·       Hop N Drops – A fantastic family-friendly restaurant, often packed with kids and parents after sports games. It was the go-to spot to wind down after a busy day, enjoy a hearty meal, and catch up with friends and neighbors.

·       DC Steakhouse – A hidden gem that provided a cozy, upscale dining experience. Whether celebrating an anniversary, a birthday, or just a well-earned night out, DC Steakhouse offered delicious meals and a welcoming atmosphere.

Of course, these are just a few highlights. Many businesses have come and gone, some fading from memory while others remain cherished. While we may not recall every name—like the travel agency, a sports bar, and a restaurnt—here’s a list of just a few that once graced our community:

Will new businesses rise to take their place and stand the test of time, or will they too become part of Sammamish’s ever-changing landscape? Only time will tell, but for now, we remember and appreciate the places that helped shape our community.

1lcktzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lcktzn/i_found_an_old_abandoned_government_facility_what/,I Found an Old Abandoned Government Facility What I Found Will Shock Anyone Who Reads This.,"In the heart of a forgotten industrial district, the rusty skeletons of once-thriving factories stood sentinel over a landscape of cracked asphalt and overgrown weeds. The setting sun cast an eerie glow on the dilapidated structures, their windows like hollow eyes watching the world pass them by. Brandon, a young man with a penchant for urban exploration, had heard whispers of an old, abandoned government facility hidden beneath the weeds. The rumors had been tantalizing, hinting at secrets long buried beneath layers of dust and decay.



With a camera in hand and a flashlight strapped to his forehead, Brandon approached the faded concrete building. The door was ajar, a silent invitation to the mysteries that lay beyond. He stepped inside, the musty scent of age and disuse assaulting his nostrils. The room was vast, with a low ceiling and walls that bore the scars of peeling paint and water damage. In the center stood a towering shelf, laden with relics of a bygone era: VHS tapes, their spines faded and cracked, and dusty cartridges of video games from his childhood.



He flipped through the tapes, reading titles after title with a sense of nostalgia that soon turned to unease. The shows listed were familiar, but the titles tags at the bottom, written in a hasty, almost frantic hand, spoke of dark secrets and government cover-ups. Brandon's heart quickened as he picked up a book titled ""The Lore of Magnetti."" The pages were yellowed and dog-eared, as if someone had studied them obsessively. The book detailed the creation of a new kind of narrator, one who could control the very fabric of reality through storytelling.



In the corner, a cobwebbed VCR sat atop a dust-covered table, the power light flickering a dull red. He inserted the tape labeled ""Mario True Origin"" with trembling hands. The machine whirred to life, and the grainy image on the ancient television set filled him with dread. It showed scenes of a world twisted by a sinister force, where beloved characters from his childhood had become vessels for malevolent beings. As he watched, the line between reality and fiction grew increasingly blurred.



The footage cut to a fight scene, and Brandon felt his stomach drop as he recognized himself, younger and less cautious, facing a monstrous version of Mario. The creature's eyes burned with an unnatural fire as it lunged at the camera, and Brandon realized with a start that he was watching his own memories. The tape ended abruptly, leaving him gasping for breath and questioning his sanity. The room grew colder, and the hairs on his arms stood on end.



The lights began to flicker in an erratic dance, and the TV screens around him crackled to life. One by one, the characters from the tapes and games emerged, their forms distorted into twisted caricatures of their former selves. Evil Mario stepped out, his iconic hat now a crown of thorns, his overalls stained with something dark. Behind him, a horde of hellish cartoons and video game sprites followed, their eyes gleaming with malice. SpongeBob's square grin was now a grotesque leer, and the once-playful Spyro had become a creature of shadow and flame.



Panic surged through Brandon's veins as he sprinted towards the exit, his footsteps echoing through the vast chamber. ""I have to get to Rachel,"" he panted, fear lending him speed. The corridor stretched on, seemingly endless, and the cacophony of demonic laughter grew louder. His mind raced with the implications of what he'd discovered. The government had not only known about the demonic presence in the games but had harnessed it. He had to warn Rachel and anyone else who would listen before it was too late.



The walls of the facility seemed to close in around him, the air thick with the scent of ozone and a hint of something much darker. As he neared the exit, the floor trembled beneath his feet, and the lights flickered violently. The door was in sight, but the demonic figures grew closer, their eyes locked on him with predatory intent. ""Rachel,"" he murmured, pushing himself to run faster, ""I'm coming."" With a final burst of adrenaline, Brandon threw himself through the doorway, slamming it shut behind him and sealing himself outside the nightmare he'd uncovered. His chest heaving, he took in the crumbling exterior of the facility, the setting sun now a blood-red orb in the sky. The battle was just beginning, and he had no idea how he would ever be able to explain the horrors of the past to the woman he loved.



The air outside was thick with the scent of rain, and thunder rumbled in the distance as if the very heavens were acknowledging the chaos unleashed below. Brandon's heart hammered in his chest as he sprinted towards his car, parked a safe distance away. The rustling of leaves and the occasional splash of rain were the only sounds that broke the silence, yet he could feel the malevolent presence of the creatures from the tape following him. He knew he didn't have much time. Rachel had to be warned.



Jumping into the car, he cranked the engine and sped off, the tires squealing against the wet asphalt. The road ahead was a blur, and his thoughts raced as fast as the windshield wipers struggling to keep up with the downpour. Rachel had always been skeptical of his adventures, but she had a soft spot for the classics. If the government had indeed tapped into the power of nostalgia to control the minds of the populace, then she could be in danger too. The thought filled him with a determination stronger than any he'd felt before.



Finally, the headlights of his car pierced the gloom, revealing Rachel's apartment building. He screeched to a halt, not bothering with parking spaces or locks. Sprinting up the stairs, he banged on her door, the echoes of his fists reverberating through the hallway. ""Rachel, open up! It's Brandon, it's an emergency!"" There was a moment of silence, and then the sound of locks clicking. The door swung open, and Rachel's worried face peered out, rain-soaked and framed by a tangle of hair. Her eyes widened in shock at the sight of him. ""What happened?"" she gasped. Without wasting another second, he grabbed her hand and pulled her inside, slamming the door shut once more.



They sat in the dim light of her living room, the TV playing a classic cartoon in the background, a stark contrast to the horrors he'd just witnessed. Brandon took a deep breath and began to recount his discovery, his voice shaking as he spoke of the government's twisted experiments and the demonic beings that now roamed the world of the living. Rachel's expression shifted from disbelief to horror as the weight of his words settled upon her. Her hand tightened in his, a silent promise of support. Together, they had to figure out a way to expose this truth before it consumed them, before the line between reality and the nightmares of their youth became indistinguishable. The storm outside grew wilder, a reflection of the tempest of fear and uncertainty that now swirled within them. But in that moment, as the first raindrops pattered against the window, a spark of rebellion was lit, and Brandon knew they would not go quietly into the dark.



Rachel's apartment felt suddenly claustrophobic, the walls closing in as the gravity of their situation settled upon them. Her eyes darted around the room, searching for any sign of the creatures that had followed him. Brandon could almost hear the cogs turning in her mind, piecing together the puzzle of his tale. ""We have to do something,"" she murmured, her voice barely audible over the din of the rain. ""We can't just sit here."" He nodded, knowing she was right. They needed a plan, a way to fight back against the creeping tide of darkness that threatened to engulf the world they knew.



They spent hours poring over the book he'd brought, the pages sticking together with dampness. The Lore of Magnetti spoke of ancient incantations and the power of the narrator, but it was the part about the true origins of their childhood heroes that sent chills down their spines. The government had used these beloved characters as bait, a way to infiltrate the minds of the young and innocent. Rachel's eyes grew wide with horror as she read the passages that described the rituals and the sacrifices made in the name of control. ""They can't get away with this,"" she whispered, her voice trembling with anger. ""We have to tell someone.""



Brandon's mind raced as he thought of the people who could help them: conspiracy theorists, underground journalists, maybe even one of the original narrators from the book. But as he voiced these thoughts, the TV in the background grew static, the cartoon figures contorting into grotesque forms. Rachel screamed, and they both jumped to their feet as the screen burst into a frenzy of flickering lights. Through the static, a single message emerged, a sinister grin spreading across the screen, ""You've seen too much."" The room grew cold, and the laughter of the demonic creatures echoed in their ears.



The rain had become a downpour, the windows rattling in their frames. They had to move quickly, before the creatures from the facility found them. Rachel grabbed her phone, her hands shaking as she searched for any allies they might have. ""We have to get out of here,"" she said urgently. ""They're coming."" Brandon nodded, his thoughts racing. They gathered their things, his camera and the book clutched tightly to his chest, and made their way to the door. As they stepped into the hallway, the lights flickered in rhythm with their racing hearts. The shadows danced around them, hinting at the malevolent force that was drawing near.



The elevator was out of the question; it was too slow, too confined. They took the stairs, their footsteps echoing through the concrete stairwell. Each floor they passed brought them closer to the ground, but also closer to the danger lurking outside. Rachel's eyes darted around, her grip on Brandon's hand like a vice. They could hear the distant wail of sirens, a sign that the world was waking up to the horror that had been unleashed. The stairs grew slick with rainwater that had seeped in from the outside, making each step treacherous. But they didn't stop, couldn't stop. Their lives, and the lives of everyone they loved, depended on it.



Finally, they reached the ground floor, the exit in sight. Rachel's hand slammed against the bar, and the door swung open, revealing the darkened streets outside. The rain had turned into a torrent, obscuring their vision. They stepped out into the storm, their hearts pounding in their chests. The city was eerily quiet, the only sounds the hiss of rain and the distant growl of thunder. They had no idea what awaited them out there, but they had to keep moving. They had to expose the truth before the government's twisted creations could claim more innocents.



The wind howled around them, carrying with it the scent of ozone and something far more sinister. The streetlights flickered, casting monstrous shadows on the wet pavement. Brandon squinted through the rain, searching for any sign of the creatures that had escaped the facility. Rachel's phone buzzed in her pocket, a message from an unknown number. She pulled it out, her hand trembling. ""We're being watched,"" it read. A chill ran down Brandon's spine as he realized the extent of their predicament. They couldn't trust anyone, not even the authorities.



They sprinted down the deserted street, the rain stinging their faces like needles. Rachel's apartment was no longer a safe haven; they needed somewhere to lie low, to plan their next move. An all-night diner loomed in the distance, its neon sign flickering a beacon of hope. They ducked inside, the warmth and the smell of greasy food a stark contrast to the cold, wet world outside. They took a booth in the back, ordering coffee that felt like a lifeline in the storm. Rachel's eyes remained glued to the phone, searching for any clue, any hint of who might believe them.



As the caffeine began to work its magic, ideas started to flow. They needed to spread the word without alerting the wrong people. The internet was their best bet, but they had to be careful. They couldn't just post the truth; they had to weave it into a story that would resonate with the masses, something that would make people question their reality without outright terrifying them. Brandon's mind raced with the beginnings of a plan. He would use his skills as a filmmaker to create a documentary, piecing together the evidence he'd collected. It would be a risky endeavor, but it was their best shot at exposing the government's dark secret.



They hunkered down in Rachel's apartment, working tirelessly through the night. The TV remained off, the silence a stark reminder of the horrors that had invaded their lives. The documentary took shape, a narrative that intertwined the innocence of childhood with the shadowy world of government conspiracy. They had to be meticulous, ensuring every fact was corroborated and every claim supported by evidence. The Lore of Magnetti sat open on the table between them, its pages a grim roadmap to the truth they sought to uncover.



As dawn approached, they had a rough outline and a handful of footage. Rachel's eyes were bloodshot, her hair a wild mess around her pale face, but she was determined. ""We'll finish this,"" she said, her voice steady despite her exhaustion. ""We'll show everyone what's happening."" Brandon nodded, his own eyes burning from lack of sleep. The rain had stopped, leaving the world outside a soggy mess. But the storm was far from over. The real battle was just beginning, and they had no idea what lay ahead.



The sun peeked through the clouds, casting a feeble light into the room. Rachel's phone buzzed again, this time with a message from a fellow conspiracy theorist she'd been in touch with. He had information, a place where they might find more answers. It was a risk, but they were out of options. They had to push forward.



They grabbed their coats and stepped into the early morning light, the world around them still and eerily quiet. The air felt heavy with anticipation, as if the very atoms were holding their breath. They walked quickly, their destination a secret location where others like them had gathered to fight against the creeping darkness. The sounds of the city slowly grew louder, the world waking up to the day, oblivious to the nightmare that lurked just beneath the surface.



As they approached the meeting place, an old, abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, the tension grew. They could feel the eyes of the creatures on them, the malevolent presence that had followed them from the facility. Rachel gripped Brandon's hand tightly, her knuckles white with fear. But there was something else there too, a spark of hope that burned brighter than any of the demons' fires. They had each other, and together, they had the power of the truth.



They stepped inside the warehouse, the door creaking shut behind them. The space was cavernous, filled with the detritus of forgotten projects and shadows that danced in the early morning light. Figures emerged from the gloom, faces Brandon recognized from the fringes of the internet. They had all seen the same things he had, felt the same terror. They had come together, united by a shared nightmare.



The leader, a grizzled man with a wild look in his eyes, stepped forward. ""You've seen it too,"" he said, his voice a gruff whisper. ""Welcome, kindred spirits."" He handed them a USB drive, the digital equivalent of a secret handshake. ""This has all the intel we've gathered so far.""



They huddled around a makeshift table, the only source of light a flickering bulb that swung overhead. The group shared their findings, each story more unbelievable than the last. Rachel's hand tightened around the USB drive as the gravity of their situation sank in. The government had infiltrated every part of their lives, using their childhood memories as a weapon.



Their plan grew clearer with each passing moment. They would combine their footage and testimonies, crafting a narrative that couldn't be ignored. They had to show the world the truth behind the smiles and laughter of their favorite characters, reveal the darkness that lurked just beneath the surface. The room was charged with a mix of fear and determination.



As they worked, the day passed in a blur of images and whispers. The warehouse was a hive of activity, a stark contrast to the desolate streets outside. They knew time was running out; the creatures would not rest until they had reclaimed their prey. But every edit brought them closer to their goal. The documentary grew into a powerful weapon, a beacon of truth in a world of shadows.



Finally, it was done. The footage was pieced together, the narrative complete. They had created a story that would resonate with every person who watched it. Rachel uploaded it to a secure server, her heart racing with anticipation. The moment the file was live, the warehouse trembled, the air thick with the scent of sulfur. They had stirred the hornet's nest, and now they waited for the sting.



The first comments trickled in, then flooded the forum. People were watching, sharing, talking. The buzz grew into a roar, and the truth spread like wildfire. The government's grip on reality began to slip, and the barrier between the world of the cursed games and their own grew thinner. The group huddled around Rachel's laptop, watching the digital battle unfold.



But with each new view, the warehouse grew colder, the shadows longer. The laughter of the demonic cartoons grew louder, a cacophony that filled their ears and chilled their bones. The TV screens flickered to life, showing twisted images of themselves, taunting them from the flickering screens. The creatures were coming.



Brandon grabbed Rachel's hand, and they sprinted for the exit. The door swung open, revealing a world transformed. The sky had turned the color of bruises, and the streets were filled with the monstrous forms of their childhood heroes. The battle had come to them. They had no choice but to run, to keep moving, and to hope that their message would reach enough people to make a difference.



The city was a war zone, the once-familiar landmarks now twisted and corrupted. They dodged the grasping hands of the demonic SpongeBob, the fiery breath of Spyro, the maniacal laughter of Crash Bandicoot. Rachel's eyes were wide with fear, but she never stopped running. They had to get to a safe place, somewhere they could regroup and plan their next move.



But every step brought them closer to the heart of the storm. The government facility loomed in the distance, a beacon of their nightmare. It was there that their journey had begun, and it was there that it would end. Either they would expose the truth and save the world, or fall prey to the creatures that sought to silence them.



Their breaths came in ragged gasps as they approached the facility, the ground trembling beneath their feet. The creatures grew more numerous, more aggressive. They could feel the pull of the facility, the dark energy that drew them in. Rachel stumbled, and Brandon swung her up into his arms, his determination unyielding.



As they reached the gates, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Magnetti, the narrator from the book, his eyes burning with an otherworldly power. ""You've done well,"" he said, his voice a sinister purr. ""But now, you've played your part."" The creatures closed in, and Rachel screamed.



The gates swung open, and Brandon could feel the malevolence seeping from the facility like a toxic mist. Rachel buried her face in his shoulder, her screams muffled by his drenched jacket. The demonic figures surrounded them, a twisted parade of childhood nightmares come to life. Yet, in the face of imminent danger, a spark of hope flickered within Brandon. He knew that as long as they had the truth, they had power.



He set Rachel down, his eyes locking onto Magnetti's. ""You won't win,"" he shouted above the chaos. ""The world is waking up to your lies."" Rachel's hand tightened around the USB drive, the digital emblem of their rebellion. Magnetti sneered, his eyes narrowing to slits. ""You think a mere story can topple an empire?""



The creatures grew more frenzied, sensing their creator's displeasure. Brandon could see the fear in Rachel's eyes, but she stood firm. ""We have to get this to the media,"" she whispered. ""We have to make them see."" They pushed through the horde, dodging grasping claws and gnashing teeth, the air thick with the scent of burning plastic and decay.



The facility loomed closer, the air vibrating with an unseen force. The ground trembled beneath their feet, a prelude to the battle that awaited them. Rachel's breathing grew ragged, but she didn't falter. They had come too far to turn back now. The doors of the facility beckoned, a yawning mouth ready to swallow them whole.



With a final burst of strength, they dashed through the entrance, the demonic horde hot on their heels. The corridors were a maze of shadows, the air thick with the stench of rotting dreams. They knew that every second counted, that the fate of the world rested in their trembling hands. Rachel fumbled with the USB, her fingers slippery with sweat.



""Hurry,"" Brandon urged, his voice tight with tension. Rachel nodded, her eyes focused on the task at hand. They stumbled into a control room, the walls lined with monitors displaying the chaos they had unleashed. The screens flickered, the demonic faces of their childhood heroes leering at them from every angle. Rachel found a computer, her fingers flying over the keyboard.



The upload began, the progress bar inching forward with painful slowness. The room grew colder, the air charged with malice. The monitors around them crackled, the images distorting into something unspeakable. Rachel's hand hovered over the 'Send' button, her eyes never leaving the screen. ""Do it,"" Brandon murmured, his voice a prayer.



The button clicked, and the screens went dark. The air in the room seemed to still, the only sound their panting breaths. Rachel looked up, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and hope. ""We did it,"" she whispered. But the silence was shattered by a guttural roar, and the ground beneath them shook violently. The creatures had found them.



The door to the control room burst open, and the horde spilled in. But as they approached, the screens flickered back to life, displaying the truth they had worked so hard to reveal. The demonic figures hesitated, their malicious grins faltering. The air grew thick with the sound of their anguished wails. The barrier between worlds was weakening, and with it, their hold on reality.



Brandon and Rachel backed away, watching in awe as the creatures began to fade, their forms dissolving into the digital ether from whence they came. The facility trembled, the very foundation of the government's dark experiment crumbling around them. They had exposed the lie, and now the truth was fighting back.



But it wasn't over. The final battle was yet to come. With the USB clutched in her hand like a talisman, Rachel turned to Brandon. ""We have to get out of here,"" she said, her voice firm. ""We have to make sure our message gets out."" They sprinted through the corridors, the walls closing in around them, the facility disintegrating before their very eyes.



The exit was a beacon of light in the darkness, a symbol of the world they had to save. Rachel clutched the USB drive, their ticket to freedom and redemption, as Brandon shielded her from the falling debris. The facility was collapsing around them, the demonic cries of the creatures echoing through the corridors as the digital prison that held them began to crumble. They stumbled out into the open, the fresh air a stark contrast to the stale stench of the underground.



The sky was a tumult of purple and black, the clouds churning as if in a rage. The cityscape was a war zone of twisted metal and shattered glass, the demonic cartoons and video game characters wreaking havoc in the streets. Rachel's eyes searched the chaos for a sign of safety, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps.



Their car was a crumpled wreck, a casualty of the battle that had spilled from the TV screens into the real world. ""We have to keep moving,"" Brandon said, his eyes scanning the horizon. Rachel nodded, her legs feeling like jelly, but she pushed herself to run. They had to find somewhere to broadcast their documentary, somewhere that could amplify the truth and shatter the government's hold on the populace.



As they sprinted through the apocalyptic streets, Rachel's thoughts turned to the people they were fighting for. The children who watched the cartoons, the adults who remembered playing the games. They had to know what was happening, had to understand the danger before it was too late. The USB drive grew warm in her hand, almost pulsing with the power of the information it contained.



They reached the top of a hill, and Rachel's heart skipped a beat. In the distance, the TV broadcast tower stood tall and gleaming, a bastion of hope in the chaos. It was their only chance. ""We have to get there,"" she panted, pointing towards the tower. ""It's our only hope.""



The journey was fraught with danger, every step a battle against the relentless pursuit of the demonic creatures. They dodged and weaved, using every ounce of their strength to stay one step ahead. Rachel could feel the weight of the world on her shoulders, the burden of truth that could either save or doom them all.



As they neared the tower, the air grew thick with a cacophony of demonic voices, all of them seemingly calling for their blood. Rachel's grip tightened around the USB drive, her determination unwavering. They had come so far, and she refused to let it end here.



Brandon's eyes were locked on the tower, his jaw set in a grim line. ""We can do this,"" he murmured, his voice a comfort in the chaos. Rachel nodded, her breathing ragged but her spirit unbroken.



They reached the base of the tower, the steel structure looming above them like a beacon of hope. The door was locked, but Brandon's desperation fueled his strength. With a roar, he slammed into it, and it gave way with a metallic screech. They sprinted up the stairs, the echoes of their footsteps a drumroll to the climax of their story.



The control room was a hive of activity, technicians and security guards scrambling to maintain order amidst the chaos. Rachel didn't hesitate, her eyes locked on the main broadcast computer. ""We need to upload this,"" she shouted over the din. ""It's the only way to save everyone.""



The guards turned, their expressions a mix of confusion and horror as they recognized the demonic figures on Rachel's screen. Brandon stepped forward, his voice commanding. ""You know what we're talking about. You've seen the footage. Help us!""



One guard took a step towards them, then another. Slowly, the room of panic became a bastion of hope. They worked together, bypassing security protocols and setting up the broadcast. Rachel slammed the USB into the computer, her eyes never leaving the upload status.



The screen flickered, the demonic images from the VHS tape now playing out across the city's screens, the truth laid bare for all to see. The air outside the tower grew still, the demonic figures pausing in their rampage. Rachel watched as the images of their childhood heroes began to change, the darkness receding from their eyes, their forms returning to the familiar, comforting shapes of their youth. The power of the truth was undeniable.



The guards looked at each other in amazement, then back at Rachel and Brandon, who were both panting heavily from the exertion. One of them, a young man with a trembling hand, offered them a nod of respect. ""Thank you,"" he said, his voice shaking. ""We never knew."" Rachel felt a weight lift from her chest, the fear giving way to a fierce resolve.



They watched as the creatures in the city paused, their malicious intent fading away. The USB drive was their key to freedom, their weapon against the shadowy government forces that had twisted their innocent memories. But the battle was not over. They had to reach a wider audience, to ensure that the truth would not be silenced again.",2,1750051716.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

The only thing child free people care about more than not having kids — is not being told to have kids. It’s truly bizarre and self centered to think anyone cares whether you choose to breed or not. 

People with kids don’t give a fuck about you because we’re too tired having kids. Enjoy your goddamned pointless meaningless lives and let us suffer in peace. 

You wanna know how my Father’s Day started? I got to sleep in like 15 extra minutes and came downstairs to a crying four year old crushed because her mom cut her peanut butter toast into four parts instead of giving her one big piece. So I pieced it back together like some Gordon Ramsay of emotional triage, added another slice, and basically tricked her into being happy again. 

All of this happened before I had one sip of coffee. 

So no, I didn’t spend even one second thinking about you childless whiners with nothing better to do than carry around a sad little victim complex about people judging your life of leisure.

That’s right I said it. Our lives are harder than yours. No you’ll never understandh. Shut up and enjoy a live show and stay out late and sleep in like a teenager you child.

We scheduled a phone coffee date for today and were just like we were thirty years ago, and it was so amazing to reconnect and laugh and get caught up (we're both reading ""romance novels"" these days hahahaha!!! which i never would have guessed for either of us way back when). three hours on the phone or so and all that distance and time gone and we were just friends just like when we both worked at a restaurant in junior college. It kind of both sucks to not have that everyday, but also is such a thunderbolt of joy to reconnect...one of the odd aspects of friendship I guess. But he also offered me a job if I want to move...a standing offer according to him...so who knows.

1lcks2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITARelationship/comments/1lcks2j/aita_for_going_to_support_my_friend_while_her/,AITA For going to support my friend while her mother is in the ICU?,"Okay before we get started, this is a throw away account. All names will be changed as this has just happened, and I am a little heated about it.

So, this past Friday my friend, Jesse (F 27) called me (F 23) crying hysterically because her mother was in the ICU for the second time this month (her mother lives 5 hours away and they have a pretty close relationship.). Jesse asked if I would be able to come and stay with her for a couple of hours to support her because she was unable to drive to her mother at that point in time. I told her that I would be there for her no matter what. I then texted my bf, Harry (M 28), if he would be able to watch the dogs because I needed to head over to Jesse's house after work (Harry and I live together).

A little backstory on Jesse and Harry because it is needed for the context of this post. Harry and Jesse were -together- before Harry and I met. It was a messy break up, both accusing the other of things, spreading gossip and all that. They eventually made up and were friends with each other inviting each other to different holidays and what not. This is how I met Harry, at one of Jesse's friends-giving parties. We met at the party but did not talk much. A couple weeks after the party, Jesse set up a blind double movie date and invited Harry to be my date. After this Harry and I were practically inseparable. Since we started dating Harry has had a grudge against Jesse, at first, they were cordial with each other but for the past year he gets upset if I even bring up her name.

Okay now back to the issue at hand. When Harry texted back, he said he didn't really want to watch the dogs. I told him okay and found a way to head over to Jesse's house while having the dogs be taken care of. After this I texted him and told him that after I got off of work at 10:30PM I wanted to -do the deed- with him before I leave and that I would be home around 2:00AM (my normal bedtime as I work 2nd shift hours). He texted back saying ""so I spend the night alone so you can go and be with Jesse and you want to wake me up at 3:00AM to -do the deed-, cool."" I texted Harry back and said not to twist my words and that I was thinking about his schedule (as he usually goes to bed around 11:00PM on Fridays). I then proceeded to blow up on him. Yes, I know this probably wasn't the right thing to do but I got tired of him always criticizing me for being friends with her. Besides hindsight is a b word. During my blow up with Harry, I remind him that he does this will all of my friends (in reality I only have 2 friends that I talk with somewhat frequently). He tried to say that he didn't but further down the text chain he admits to this. He then says ""do what you gotta do"" and continues to answer my texts with single sentence answers. I was fed up at this point.

Needless to say, I went over to support Jesse on Friday night as I already had the dogs being taken care of and did not need to worry about them. I also went over straight after work. Once I got there, I took care of her while she was a nervous wreck. I fed her, cleaned her house, fed her dogs, and sat and talked with her to try and distract her for a little while. It worked and she fell asleep around 1:00AM. I was home by 1:45PM. When I got home, I was shocked to find that Harry was awake and watching something on his TV. I tried to say ""Hi, I'm home"" to him at least 5 different times before I gave up and went to take a shower. After my shower I went in and saw that he had just laid down to go to bed. I told him I was home and asked him why he was mad at me. He said ""You know why."" I then said okay, we can talk about this tomorrow and told him I love you and waited for a reply. All I got was "" I am too mad at you to say it back."" I then went to my room to calm down from the day and say Hi to my pups.

The next day, I was still pretty heated from the conversations with Harry the day before, so I took both of my pups for separate runs. I still was pretty mad so I ended up going on another run; I did not know that I was going to end up a couple miles from my house but I did. I couldn't make it back to the house as I did not have any water and it was getting to be about 90 degrees F outside. I ended up having to call Harry to come and get me as I needed water and there was nothing but fields and farmland around me, and I did not have my wallet. He said he would come and get me. At this point it was about 11:00AM. I had been away from the house for about 4 hours after all of the runs. He did not ask once where I was or where I went. On the car ride home, I tried to talk to him and ask him how he slept, did he already have breakfast, etc. you know the normal morning conversation. He didn't reply, just drove home in silence.

At home he spent most of the day not talking, touching, or looking at me which was out of the norm for him. As the day progressed I was cleaning the house top to bottom as my parents were coming over the next day for father's day. It was about 4:00PM when he wanted to go to a couple different stores (Arc, Kohls, and Walmart). We ended up spending a couple hours out of the house, but the vibes were off and he said very little while we were together. I brushed it off as just thinking about it would send me into an over thinking spiral. That night, I made dinner, baked chicken, chili, rice, and peas. Nothing was said at dinner, all he did was watch videos on his phone. No thank you or anything like that. He just sat and ate. He then went to his room and proceeded to try and go to bed. I then asked him why doesn't he sleep in my room as we haven't been able to spend time together since last weekend. He said he was good and didn't want to. I told him fine. I said I love you; he still didn't say it back. I went to bed with my pups.

Okay so today is Sunday. I slept in today and woke up at 9:00AM. I went downstairs to get my coffee started and realized that Harry was not home. I didn't know where he was, so I texted him and asked him. I did not get a response from him. He ended up coming home around 11:30AM. Told me he went to breakfast with his dad and now he was on his way to his friend's house to help him move some things around. I said okay and walked backup stairs as I wanted to work on my courses some more. I reminded him that my parents were going to be here in a couple hours and that the ribs would need to be started before they got here. He agreed to make the ribs a week before when the plans were made. Needless to say, he came back home 15 minutes before my parents arrived. The ribs were not on the smoker, and I did not know how to work it. I had to quickly shift plans and make burgers and the main dish instead of the ribs. While my parents were at the house, my mother even picked up on his attitude and asked me about it. I told her and she said he ""needed to get over it.""  So tonight, I confronted him about his attitude and actions. He told me that he was still upset over the fact I went to go support my friend on Friday. I asked him why he was so upset about me hanging out with Jesse. All he could say is that she was unpredictable and unresponsible. I asked him how that affected me as a person and Harry couldn't come up with an answer. I then reminded him that I only have Jesse to talk to because my other friend I am not that close with. He said that I shouldn't be friends with her because they have a past together. I asked if he could just be cordial with Jesse but he kept insisting that I had to make it up to him for hanging out with her and that I shouldn't be friends with her. I asked him if he just wanted me to become a recluse and only talk to him and my parents and he could not come up with an answer. I then went to my room for the rest of the night stewing.

I didn't know what to do after this so, I came here to write this post, and see what other's thought of the situation. So AITA for supporting Jesse while her mom was in the ICU?",1,1750051517.0,AITARelationship,0,1.0,False

We both share the same friend groups. I was never going to act on this because I felt like I would be dating everyone of my friends, we really tell each other everything. And privacy would be a concern.

Anyway, the news of my crush travelled and reached her a month ago, I didn't know yet that she knew. I only noticed at a party we both went to. We were both drunk at that point. She would not leave my side, she was physically affectionate. I loved every moment of it.

A friend of ours suggested I take her for a coffee date, just to see if we would click as potential partners. The date didn't happen because something came up on her part.

I'm also being told she thinks I fumbled by going with a coffee place as a first date. I also fumbled because I saw her cancellation 2 hours late and I was already at the shop at that point. I fumbled because the first thing I should have done when I woke up was to confirm if we're still on, which I didn't. And had no right to be disappointed and distant when she cancelled.

I wish we would've talked to each other directly, and figured things out together. This is the only non-relationship relationship that left me questioning myself as a potential partner and I think it's because it's her.

Yesterday I told my friends, I am letting this one go. I just don't think I'll be able to love her the way she wants and I'll just feel like I'm constantly failing her. Especially when our communication started off in the commodes.

I'm also not the biggest fan of meat (eg I'll eat chicken but eating a whole steak is a no from me dawg) and I enjoy a sweet treat every now and again. 

As I quickly discovered, many of my usual foods contained either dairy or sneaky soy, so I would have loved some practical tips when I first started navigating all of this. I thought I would compile a list of foods/snacks I've tried and enjoyed, and where I got them from, as well as some other helpful tips. 

All of the following foods are dairy/soy free and available from Woolworths. 

- Milk - VitaSoy Oat Milky Long Life Milk - CAUTION: some almond milks contain soy!

- Protein milk - Oat Milk Goodness OMG Chocolate protein oat milk. I use this in coffee to make a ""mocha"" or use it to make a higher protein chia seed pudding.

I had an upper endoscopy done and was diagnosed with mild gastritis. I started Prilosec again and when symptoms were gone, I slowly weaned off and started Pepcid every day. Symptoms still present themselves, albeit usually mildly. I’ve figured out that the churning feeling really only happens when my stomach is completely empty (mornings or if I skip a meal) and usually when I drink my hot coffee on an empty stomach (which is stupid anyway, I know). The churning is really the only symptom I have and it is relatively infrequent—happens 4 or 5 times per week and lasts only a minute or two.

I wish we would've talked to each other directly, and figured things out together. This is the only non-relationship relationship that left me questioning myself as a potential partner and I think it's because it her.

Yesterday I told my friends, I am letting this one go. I just don't think I'll be able to love her the way she wants and I'll just feel like I'm constantly failing her. Especially when our communication started off in the commodes.",0,1750050748.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

1lckjma,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lckjma/aio_for_thinking_my_ex_cheated_on_me/,AIO for thinking my ex cheated on me?,"Hi Reddit,

bit of an odd one, but I’m at an impasse here and I would love to get some perspective. I’m also not sure this is the right sub, since I’m asking a very specific question, so if there is a better place to put this, please let me know. I (F26) broke up with my ex-girlfriend R (F25) well over a year ago, but our breakup was recently dug up again, and I’ve been processing a lot.

  
I broke up with her for many reasons - I felt like most attempts I made at communicating my feelings and needs were met with distain and (for lack of a better description) putting herself in the victim’s position (for example, she backed out of plans that we had made two months before at the last minute, and when I said I was disappointed but I understood, she accused me of crossing her boundaries; another time, I got really upset at being excluded by her and her friends, and she told me that she had been manipulated to exclude me. I know this is vague, I’m just really not interested in this reaching my real life lol - there were many small situations like this.) It felt like I was putting a lot more labour into the relationship than she was, and I consistently felt unseen and unheard. We also had different visions of our futures (living situations, kids, etc.), and we have moral values that are incompatible. However, one of the biggest reasons I broke it off was actually tied to a friendship that she had with C (M29).

A note on C, is that I (obviously) do not like him very much. R confided in me that he had asked her out several times, and that he had sexually harassed her by touching her inappropriately. They continued to be friends (and still are to this day, as far as I’m aware) and ”friend cuddled” frequently, went on one-on-one “friend dates” to coffee shops and on walks, played board games, went on trips together (national and international) and spent many, many long evenings at each other’s houses, having deep talks “about life”.

Here’s where I need your help - many folks in my life consider this relationship between the two of them to be cheating. I didn’t for a long time, but I’m on the fence now, and I’d love to hear y’all’s perspective.

R and my relationship was not sexual in any way - we‘re both aspec. The only way that I see our relationship differing from theirs is that we called each other “babe”, kissed, and said “I love you”. Every other aspect seemed to be mirrored in C and R’s relationship. 

Would you consider this cheating? I fully believe R when she says that there was nothing sexual between her and C, ever, but even given that, I still felt cheated on. Would I be overreacting if I labeled it as such?

We are officially halfway through the year and I've lost all damn hope for this community.

We're currently running of kaaatie archive channels, blen touad, the remains of cpll's limited influence, and reddit posts. It's been a damn while since we got an AU that got many views. While yes Cpll has impacted us greatly. Mind you that it doesn't last long and may be forgotten or won be talked about anymore (like danger, science, and crimson) we also have creators making potentially amazing AUs quitting or not finishing. NOTE: Ever since kaaatie quit the fpe fanbase has lost more and more fans. Especially in between 2 months and another within 2 more months. Youcan see this in the view counts of the AUs. Danger au right now has 21 million views (10 months ago), science has 6.8 million views (8 months ago), crimson has 1.8 million views (6 months ago) however since now we are at literally at the bottom of the barrel surviving off oc cpll clips and blen touad.

I'm giving this another go looking for a genuine long-term connection. Looking for that person to spend time with, that person to say good morning and good night to, that person to send dumb silly messages to throughout the day just because. I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic on top of all this so it makes for quite a combo. Now a bit about me with a mix of...what I'm sort of looking for too?

*  I'm 26 and will turn 27 this year. Genetics has given me some gray hair though...not sure how I feel about it totally yet.
* I stand at a very tall, very impressive 5'5. That means I am the perfect height for sinks or something...I don't know exactly, but I'm sure it is perfect for something! Either way, you can wear heels and be taller if you like, I have no qualms about this. 
* Hobby-wise been doing more hiking lately, trying to hit the gym more, and debating whether or not greek yogurt is actually worth it! 
* I also love going on random drives so someone that enjoys being a passenger princess late at night to get ice cream or boba or even coffee and bread is a bonus. I'm a mix of outdoorsy and indoors. Occasionally down to club, more down to bar hop or wine taste or breweries. Also down to stay home and read or watch a show and try and figure out why we thought it might be good when it disappoints us! 
* I'm everything from serious to sweet to goofy to sassy and sarcastic. I match energies more than anything and choose my attitude towards things appropriately. 
* I'm single, monogamous, no children (definitely lean towards wanting them), and unless busy with work, reply fast. You do not need to reply quick, I just do because my work has a lot of busy for 20 and not busy for 5 while things test and such. 
* If you do game a bit, always a bonus since I do wish I had someone to play It Takes Two with or even Portal 2! Little game night dates are always fun in my book! 

I'm sorry if it is a bit to read, but didn't want you to feel blind going in! If you think we might vibe or want to talk and see how things might be, reach out, no expectations or pressure!

Total distance would have been 4 inches (10 cm). I don't think it hit he lens/mount. I've been shooting, and i don't think i see any image/sharpness difference with the lens, or any other lenses i mount to it. 

I know ibis works, because i see the image difference with it turned on and off, and i see the vibration difference when it's off and i zoom in 100%.

I had my D70 fall 3 feet, lens first, about 15 years ago. The lens broke, but the body, and mount were fine, and it shot for years and didn't think about it.

If i recall how the D70 was built vs the magnesium alloy construction of the Z5ii, the Z5ii should be far more durable. But i can't help and not be in my head about the tumble; and I can't help thinking about the jolt a sensative peice of tech like the IBIS took.

Amelia stood by the floor–to–ceiling window. Her fingertip was hovering over her phone screen for three long seconds before she finally dialed a number that had been dormant for years. 

“Amy, is that you?” The shocked voice came from the other end. It was Tony Perry. “Am I dreaming?” 

“I’m coming back,” she murmured gently, but her voice pierced through the silence of the previous several years like a razor. 

“Are you serious?” Tony dropped his coffee cup on the ground. His voice trembled with excitement. “That is incredible! Do you realize how hard Owen has been hammering us since your disappearance? Since you 



resigned, he has stolen twenty important criminal cases from us! We have been entirely under his thumb! 

“There are so many clients lining up for you to take their cases. I’m sure that once news of your return breaks, the whole legal world will be shocked!” 

Amelia raised her gaze to look at her reflection in the glass. 

Her long hair hung neatly over her shoulders. She wore a beige outfit under her apron that still had grease spots from tonight’s dinner. 

No one would have thought that this woman was once the queen of the courtroom–notorious for forcing her opponents to crack under pressure. 

“After all these years, did Owen ever discover your true identity? Did 

he…” 

“He doesn’t need to know,” she cut him off. “I’ve already decided to divorce him. The next time we meet will be in court.” 

With that, she hung up the phone. Just as she turned to head back to the bedroom, her phone buzzed with a new message. 

“I drank too much. Come pick me up.” It was from Owen. 

She stared at the message for a long moment. 

After three years, he was still sending short, clipped texts as if he were delivering commands to a subordinate. 

At the VIP lounge of Venus Club, Amelia was about to push the door open when she heard laughter from within. 

“Owen, how many wins in a row is this now? You’re a damn legend! Is there any case you can’t win? Everyone else is just roadkill on your way to the top!” 



“Not really,” someone added. “There was one person who could rival him, which was Amy. But she suddenly retired three years ago and disappeared without a trace.” 

“She probably got married. After three years, she’s likely got a kid by now. No way she’s coming back,” another voice chimed in. 

“That might not be necessarily true. Owen’s been married three years as well, and he has no kid. Besides, he lives at the law firm and barely goes home. Speaking of which, are you still not into your wife after all this time?” 

“Do you even have to ask?” someone mocked. “Owen despised those nice, wifey types. If she hadn’t gotten him drunk and climbed into his bed one night, he would never have married her. He prefers strong, independent women–women who match him, like Melissa. Even after all these years, he still cannot forget her.” 

Amelia’s eyes hardened when she heard Melissa Todd’s name. She pushed the door open without hesitation. 

The 

room instantly fell dead silent, and everyone exchanged nervous glances. 

She ignored them and let her gaze sweep across the room until it landed on Owen. He was slouched on the sofa with his eyes closed, clearly drunk. The sharp lines of his handsome face were softened by the dim lighting, casting gentle shadows across his features. 

She walked over and reached out to help him up. 

“She stumbled slightly under the weight as his arms draped over her shoulder. ” 

That familiar scent of cologne and whiskey hit her, making her dazed for 

a moment. 



Just as Amelia puthim into the back seat, Owen grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his arms. 

His lips landed on hers, warm and uninvited. 

She froze. 

He had never kissed her in three years of marriage, except for one drunken mishap. 

Then, in a murmur slurred by alcohol, he breathed out a name, “Melissa…” 

He had mistaken her for someone else. 

A sharp pain stabbed through Amelia’s chest, and she stared hard at the man before her. “Do you really love her that much?” 

Owen did not respond. Instead, he drew her closer, his grip tightening behind her head as he kissed her with an almost violent ferocity. 

His fingers tangled in her hair, and his breath was hot against her cheek. The car door was shut tight behind her. There was nowhere to retreat, and she could only close her eyes and endure it. 

When the kiss was finally over, he mumbled on her lips, still in a drunken haze. “Don’t leave me.” 

Amelia slowly closed her eyes. After a long silence, she pulled a document from a folder and held it up to him. 

“If you don’t want me to leave, sign this.” 

He blinked at her, his vision blurry. She knew he was looking at someone else through her. But in the end, he signed the paper. 

“Owen, after the one–month cooling–off period, we’ll both finally be free once we get the divorce certificate.” 

She let out a bitter chuckle and stared at the divorce agreement with his signature. Her mind raced frantically. 

Moonlight streamed softly into the car, and in that moment, she suddenly recalled the first time she met Owen. 



 

It had been during a high–profile inter–state case. 

She had just won a major lawsuit while the defendant had lost badly. As she walked out of the courthouse, a man rushed at her and grabbed her by the throat in a rage.” 

Just as she was choking for air, a hand clamped down on the attacker’s wrist with such force she could hear bones crack. 

“Are you trying to add extra years to your sentence for committing violence outside of a courthouse?” 

The voice was icy and harsh, like a razor slashing her eardrum. 

When Amelia looked up, she was met with a pair of dark, piercing eyes. 

She felt her heart skip a beat at that moment. 

Later, she discovered that the man who saved her was none other than her most formidable opponent in the legal world, Owen Hayes. 

From that moment on, she began taking frequent work trips to Houston. 

She saw him in court, silencing his opponents with razor–sharp arguments. Later, she noticed him standing by the window, smoking quietly in deep thought. 

She even started attending the social clubs he frequented. However, he never recognized her. 

Until one night, she found him completely wasted in a pub. 

Owen gripped her wrist, his voice raspy. “Why do you have to leave?” 

“She had no idea what he meant, but he pulled her into a furious kiss before she could process his words. ” 

They slept together that night. 

The next morning, he stared at the bloodstain on the sheets for a long time and said nothing. 

“I’ll take responsibility. Let’s get married.” he eventually said. 

Amelia was silent for a long time before nodding. Hence, she quit her work. hid her identity, and married him. 

After the wedding, he remained cold and distant. He had barely home and never touched her again. 

She thought it was just his nature. So she poured all her tenderness into trying to warm his heart. 

Until one day, she found a photo in his study. 

It was of a woman in a white dress standing on a bridge in Cambridge. her smile so dazzling it was nearly blinding. 

A few words were written on the back of the photo that tore Amelia’s heart apart. 

“If I can’t marry you, then who I marry doesn’t matter.” 

Only later did she learn that the woman was Owen’s first love, a famous pianist named Melissa Todd. 

After graduating, Melissa chose to study abroad and broke up with him. Years had passed, but he never let her go. The night Owen got drunk was the day when he found out she had a new boyfriend overseas. 

In the three years that they were married, Amelia had seen him scowl at the birthday cakes she baked with care. She had watched him toss her thoughtfully prepared dinners straight into the trash. She had even stood on the side of the highway–in pain, during her period–after he 

Chapter 2 

abandoned her upon hearing that Melissa was flying back to the States. 

That was the moment when her heart finally went cold. 



After putting the divorce papers into her bag, she drove home. 

She helped him back to his room, then spent the night packing. 

The next morning, Owen woke with a pounding hangover, and the first thing he saw was a floor full of suitcases. 

He frowned and asked coldly, “What are you doing?”  ",1,1750050128.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

He was well known in Houston for being undefeated in criminal cases, while she was well known in New York for being unstoppable in civil litigation. 

Everyone in the industry called them the “King” and “Queen” of courts. 

Little did they know that Amelia had hidden her identity in the legal world three years ago, and married Owen. 

She chose to play the part of the gentle wife by cooking for him, accompanying him to social events, and waiting for him to come every night. 

But now, she was done pretending. 



Amelia stood by the floor–to–ceiling window. Her fingertip was hovering over her phone screen for three long seconds before she finally dialed a number that had been dormant for years. 

“Amy, is that you?” The shocked voice came from the other end. It was Tony Perry. “Am I dreaming?” 

“I’m coming back,” she murmured gently, but her voice pierced through the silence of the previous several years like a razor. 

“Are you serious?” Tony dropped his coffee cup on the ground. His voice trembled with excitement. “That is incredible! Do you realize how hard Owen has been hammering us since your disappearance? Since you 



resigned, he has stolen twenty important criminal cases from us! We have been entirely under his thumb! 

“There are so many clients lining up for you to take their cases. I’m sure that once news of your return breaks, the whole legal world will be shocked!” 

Amelia raised her gaze to look at her reflection in the glass. 

Her long hair hung neatly over her shoulders. She wore a beige outfit under her apron that still had grease spots from tonight’s dinner. 

No one would have thought that this woman was once the queen of the courtroom–notorious for forcing her opponents to crack under pressure. 

“After all these years, did Owen ever discover your true identity? Did 

he…” 

“He doesn’t need to know,” she cut him off. “I’ve already decided to divorce him. The next time we meet will be in court.” 

With that, she hung up the phone. Just as she turned to head back to the bedroom, her phone buzzed with a new message. 

“I drank too much. Come pick me up.” It was from Owen. 

She stared at the message for a long moment. 

After three years, he was still sending short, clipped texts as if he were delivering commands to a subordinate. 

At the VIP lounge of Venus Club, Amelia was about to push the door open when she heard laughter from within. 

“Owen, how many wins in a row is this now? You’re a damn legend! Is there any case you can’t win? Everyone else is just roadkill on your way to the top!” 



“Not really,” someone added. “There was one person who could rival him, which was Amy. But she suddenly retired three years ago and disappeared without a trace.” 

“She probably got married. After three years, she’s likely got a kid by now. No way she’s coming back,” another voice chimed in. 

“That might not be necessarily true. Owen’s been married three years as well, and he has no kid. Besides, he lives at the law firm and barely goes home. Speaking of which, are you still not into your wife after all this time?” 

“Do you even have to ask?” someone mocked. “Owen despised those nice, wifey types. If she hadn’t gotten him drunk and climbed into his bed one night, he would never have married her. He prefers strong, independent women–women who match him, like Melissa. Even after all these years, he still cannot forget her.” 

Amelia’s eyes hardened when she heard Melissa Todd’s name. She pushed the door open without hesitation. 

The 

room instantly fell dead silent, and everyone exchanged nervous glances. 

She ignored them and let her gaze sweep across the room until it landed on Owen. He was slouched on the sofa with his eyes closed, clearly drunk. The sharp lines of his handsome face were softened by the dim lighting, casting gentle shadows across his features. 

She walked over and reached out to help him up. 

“She stumbled slightly under the weight as his arms draped over her shoulder. ” 

That familiar scent of cologne and whiskey hit her, making her dazed for

Without giving too much detail away, she came from another country before she ended up in Israel. She escaped and was captured and tortured (and I assume wasn’t treated well sexually as my cousins have implied but I’ve never asked) and then escaped the prison again. Her brothers that she escaped with were kept and tortured for years, they couldn’t escape the prison. She made it out. She made it to Israel. She built a beautiful home with my uncle. She kept whatever small memories of her country hidden in her home. She had a singular picture of her family together. That’s all. 

I know I shouldn’t feel upset by this. She lost everything, not me. I didn’t lose anything. Her home was the home I would stay by when I visit Israel. I imagined my children playing on her swing, picking mangoes from her tree. Whenever she comes to the US my son calls her grandma. That’s how absolutely sweet this woman is. It was the first place I met the Israeli side of my family. I had so many memories there. And I’m crying as if it was my home. And it wasn’t. Maybe because this is a continuation of the violence that severely injured my cousin (daughter of a different uncle) at nova and I don’t think anyone has moved past that yet. Maybe that’s why I keep bouncing from laughing to crying. Or maybe I finally just lost it between hearing the horrors my family is living through and feeling guilty over not being able to do anything but send regards and money from afar. 

I have no right to feel this grief. The last items she had of her dead husband and that one picture are gone. Her home is literally a hole in the ground. She lost something so monumental that I can’t begin to describe it. 

And she’s already looking forward to rebuilding. I don’t know what kind of crazy resilience Israel is putting in the water but holy shit. She’s acting like it was nothing, and I’m sure that compared to her life it wasn’t as horrific but it’s still so much loss. And she’s laughing because the one thing that survived was the can of coffee in her fridge. She literally made a cup of coffee and said lechaim on it laughing. 

And I’m here crying being dramatic. It wasn’t even my home. I had no ownership, no claim, nothing and I’m here still not comprehending. And she’s here smiling and laughing over a cup of coffee in her house filled with rubble. Bibi must be putting some sort of chemicals in the water because how is that possible??

In all seriousness, I’m happy she can smile. I’m sorry for her loss but I’m happy she survived, she was *this close* to staying home for Shabbat. I’m so happy she didn’t. 

Idk what I expect to get from posting this here. I just know that I can’t describe the destruction of her house anywhere else on the internet without getting yelled at that she deserved it and she’s a genocider. 

I’m sorry the internet is awful to Israel. But I hope that bibi keeps adding the resilience to the water because yall Israelis are unreal in the absolute greatest way.

Kitchens are no longer just for cooking—they're the heart of the home, a place where families gather, guests mingle, and memories are made. As we step into 2025, homeowners are embracing new design trends that fuse style, technology, and sustainability. Whether you're planning a full [kitchen renovation experts in New Jersey](https://www.cardonecustoms.com) or just looking for a few stylish upgrades, this year's trends offer something for every taste and lifestyle.

# 

# 1. Smart Kitchens Go Mainstream

Technology continues to transform our homes, and kitchens are no exception. In 2025, smart kitchens are becoming more common, with features designed to make life easier.

* Voice-activated appliances like ovens, lights, and coffee makers are being widely adopted.
* Smart refrigerators now come with built-in cameras, touchscreens, and grocery tracking.
* Touchless faucets and motion-sensor lighting add both convenience and hygiene.

These upgrades not only enhance functionality but also make kitchens feel more futuristic and luxurious.

# 2. Natural and Earthy Aesthetics

In contrast to high-tech additions, kitchen aesthetics are leaning toward nature-inspired designs. Earthy tones, natural textures, and calming palettes are dominating the scene.

* Think wood finishes, stone countertops, and muted greens and browns.
* Open shelving with organic ceramics or clay pottery adds a handmade, cozy feel.
* Indoor herb gardens and potted plants are being used to bring in greenery and freshness.

This style creates a warm and inviting atmosphere that feels grounded and relaxing.

# 3. Bold Colors and Two-Tone Cabinets

While some homeowners are sticking with neutrals, many are embracing bolder, expressive colors in their kitchens.

* Two-tone cabinetry—a mix of darker base cabinets with lighter uppers—adds depth and dimension.
* Navy blue, forest green, and terracotta are leading choices for cabinetry.
* Accent walls, colorful backsplashes, and statement lighting fixtures help personalize the space.

The result is a kitchen that's both stylish and packed with personality.

# 4. Sustainable Materials and Eco-Friendly Designs

With growing environmental awareness, sustainability is a top priority in 2025 kitchen renovations.

* Homeowners are opting for recycled countertops, bamboo cabinetry, and low-VOC paints.
* Energy-efficient appliances and LED lighting help reduce power consumption.
* Water-saving faucets and composting systems are becoming standard features.

Eco-friendly doesn't mean boring—it means smart design with lasting impact.

# 5. Minimalist Layouts with Hidden Storage

Clutter-free kitchens are in, and smart storage is the key to achieving that sleek, clean look.

* Hidden drawers, pull-out pantries, and corner storage solutions maximize space.
* Appliances are being built into cabinetry to maintain a streamlined appearance.
* Handleless cabinets, integrated lighting, and flat-panel surfaces make everything look smooth and modern.

This minimalist approach helps your kitchen feel larger and more organized—perfect for both cooking and entertaining.

# 6. Multi-Functional Kitchen Islands

The humble kitchen island has evolved into a central feature that does more than provide counter space.

* In 2025, islands often include built-in sinks, cooktops, and wine coolers.
* They serve as a workstation, dining area, and social hub all in one.
* Dual-level islands are gaining popularity, offering distinct zones for prep and seating.

If you have the space, upgrading your island is one of the most impactful changes you can make.

# 7. Retro Touches Meet Modern Design

Nostalgia is making a comeback—but with a twist. Designers are blending retro vibes with modern functionality.

* Checkerboard floors, curved cabinetry, and vintage-style hardware are resurging.
* Colorful appliances that resemble 50s-era styles bring a fun, playful energy.
* Paired with modern materials, these elements create a unique, eclectic space that feels both familiar and fresh.

# Conclusion: Renovate for the Way You Live

Kitchen trends in 2025 reflect a balance between cutting-edge innovation and a desire to reconnect with nature and comfort. Whether you're into tech-forward solutions, rustic charm, or bold design choices, this year offers something to inspire every homeowner. Remember, the best kitchen renovation isn't about following every trend—it’s about creating a space that suits your lifestyle, feels like home, and makes everyday living a little bit better.",1,1750049527.0,u_Delicious-Top-3065,0,1.0,False

We met in September, but became better friends in January and have been getting closer since then.

Last night was especially interesting; he never talked about his dad before. But last night he told me all about him (while intoxicated), and how he was estranged from him, and his dad's recent death. He was very vulnerable. I'm glad he trusted me with it.

Here are other things he's done:

* I notice he looks at me a lot when we're in a group, even when I'm not talking
* He helped me tour apartments, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language that well), and used his car to move all my stuff.
* He walked me home on my first night at my new apartment, even though his house is much closer.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo I took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut my steak during a meal after I had just offered him a bite (he cut the whole steak, then took a piece). When a friend pointed out that he's too nice to me, and that's why she thought he likes me, he just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. He also asked who else thinks that he likes me (in our office)
* He pays attention to the things I do or do not like. And he proudly points out that he remembers whenever it's brought up, or tells people (like when I put too much spice on my food, he tells them ""oh she likes spicy food""
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants, and i played along, he got panicked and defensive, and has been getting more embarrassed by small things when his friends point them out in front of me
* When a man stalked me and asked me out in the office, I told him how it made me uncomfortable and explained what happened, so he called the guy a creep and went to look for him to make sure he wasn't around still.
* When his friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at me and smiled, and tilted his head as if asking, ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""

But there are signs he may not like me:

* He’s deflected my invitation to go walk by the river twice, the first time he was hungover and sick, the second time he had to work.
* He’s never taken much initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another time to grab coffee.
* When I offered to accompany him on a long trip (2-3 hours) even though I had a deadline, he said i should probably stay and work. I told him I'm almost finished with my work, but he told me the trip might take longer, so it's okay, and that I should stay back. I feel like sometimes he avoids one-on-one time (could be due to overthinking and his english skills; he did tell me he wants to be more talkative with me in english like he is in his native language with his other friends, thats why he's trying really hard to learn it recently)",1,1750048759.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

In today’s fast-changing design landscape, [**contemporary style furniture** ](http://directfactoryfurniture.com)continues to dominate homes across the country. But while this sleek and functional style is universally admired, how it’s used often varies based on location — especially when comparing urban and suburban homes.

From space-saving innovations in city apartments to expansive layouts in suburban houses, let’s explore how contemporary style furniture trends differ between urban and suburban living.

# What Defines Contemporary Style Furniture?

Before diving into the trends, it’s helpful to understand what contemporary style furniture is all about.

Characterized by **clean lines, neutral color palettes, minimal ornamentation, and a strong focus on function**, this furniture style blends comfort and modern aesthetics. It often features materials like metal, glass, wood, and leather, while keeping spaces open, airy, and uncluttered.

Now, let’s look at how this design philosophy is interpreted in different environments.

# Urban Homes: Contemporary Furniture for Compact Living

In urban settings — think apartments, lofts, and condos — space is often limited. This has shaped specific contemporary furniture trends designed for both form and function.

# 1. Space-Saving and Multifunctional Pieces

Urban dwellers prioritize furniture that does more than one job. Fold-out desks, storage ottomans, nesting tables, and modular sofas are staples in contemporary urban interiors.

# 2. Sleek, Low-Profile Designs

To avoid visual clutter in small spaces, furniture in urban homes tends to be low-profile and minimalist. Clean silhouettes and raised legs (to create a floating effect) help open up rooms.

# 3. Smart Storage Solutions

From beds with built-in drawers to wall-mounted entertainment units, contemporary style furniture in the city is designed to maximize storage without sacrificing aesthetics.

# 4. Neutral and Monochrome Palettes

Urban homes often favor a muted color scheme with blacks, whites, grays, and metallics to create a sophisticated, space-efficient atmosphere.

# Suburban Homes: Contemporary Furniture for Open Layouts

Suburban homes typically offer more square footage, allowing homeowners greater flexibility in choosing and arranging their **contemporary style furniture**.

# 1. Oversized & Statement Pieces

Unlike in the city, larger furniture pieces like sectional sofas, oversized coffee tables, and wide dining sets are popular in suburban homes. These create focal points in expansive rooms.

# 2. Layered Comfort

Suburban interiors often blend the sleekness of contemporary style with cozy elements. Think plush cushions, textured rugs, and soft lighting — all while maintaining clean lines and balance.

# 3. Indoor-Outdoor Integration

With more access to patios, decks, and backyards, contemporary outdoor furniture has become an extension of suburban interior design, often using similar materials and color schemes for cohesion.

# 4. Personalized Accents

Thanks to more space and creative freedom, suburban homes can mix contemporary core pieces with personalized décor — artwork, greenery, and custom lighting — to add warmth and individuality.

# Shared Design Trends Across Both Settings

Despite the contrasts, several **contemporary style furniture** trends bridge the gap between urban and suburban spaces:

* **Sustainable Materials**: Whether in the city or suburbs, eco-conscious consumers are favoring FSC-certified woods, recycled fabrics, and low-VOC finishes.
* **Tech-Integrated Designs**: Charging ports in side tables, adjustable standing desks, and wireless speaker systems are being seamlessly built into contemporary furniture.
* **Open Concepts**: Both environments appreciate the value of open, flexible spaces, often using furniture as subtle dividers rather than walls.

# Which Style Is Right for You?

If you live in an urban apartment, prioritize compact, multifunctional contemporary pieces that help you stay organized without compromising style. For suburban homes, you can embrace larger-scale items that reflect comfort and elegance while still adhering to contemporary principles.

Ultimately, **contemporary style furniture** is about meeting the needs of modern living — no matter where you call home.

# Final Thoughts

From minimalist city lofts to spacious suburban homes, [**contemporary style furniture**](http://directfactoryfurniture.com) proves its adaptability and timeless appeal. While the trends may differ based on lifestyle and layout, the core principles remain the same: clean design, practical function, and effortless style.

So I (32F) have been friends with *Emma* (33F) since college. We’ve been through everything together—breakups, job changes, family losses, all of it. She married *Dylan* (35M) five years ago, and while I never *loved* the guy, I kept my distance and was polite. He always gave me a bit of a weird vibe—like he was trying too hard to seem chill while constantly subtly putting Emma down. But it wasn’t anything I could *prove*, and Emma always seemed happy, so I let it go.

Fast forward to last month. I was at a work conference in another city. On the second night, a few coworkers and I went to a hotel bar for drinks. I was waiting for my order when I saw Dylan. At first, I assumed I was mistaken, but nope—it was him. He was sitting *very* close to a woman who was *definitely not* Emma. I watched for maybe 10 seconds and then saw him *kiss* her. Not a peck—a full-on, lingering kiss.

I was shocked. I didn’t say anything to him, just quickly took a photo from across the bar (yes, I know that sounds shady, but I was panicking and wanted proof in case I wasn’t believed). I left immediately.

That night I barely slept. I went back and forth on what to do. I didn’t want to destroy Emma’s marriage, but I also couldn’t just *not* tell her. If it were me, I’d want to know.

So I texted Emma and said I needed to talk. We met for coffee the next morning, and I told her gently what I’d seen. I showed her the photo. She didn’t say much—just stared at it and said, “Okay.”

I thought maybe she was in shock. I told her I was so sorry and that I didn’t want to hurt her, but I thought she deserved to know.

Well… turns out Dylan had been cheating on her for *over a year*. Emma confronted him, he admitted to everything, and they’re now in the middle of a divorce. Apparently that woman at the bar was someone he met on a “business trip,” and it wasn’t even the *first* time he’d cheated.

Here’s where things get complicated: some of our mutual friends are now mad at *me*. They say I should’ve stayed out of it, that “cheating isn’t always black and white” and that maybe Emma could’ve worked it out if I hadn’t gotten involved. One even said I was “self-righteous” and “inserted myself where I didn’t belong.”

I don’t know. I didn’t *mean* to ruin her marriage. I just couldn’t live with myself knowing she was being lied to. But now that their whole life is blowing up and some of our friends are blaming me, I’m starting to wonder if I did the wrong thing.

I’ve dealt with chronic constipation my entire life and of course pregnancy has only made it worse. Currently 37 weeks and it’s really bad. I take a daily stool softener as well a magnesium supplement. Just one of these would have been enough to get me going pre pregnancy. I also drink a ton of water, close to 3L per day. I do eat plenty of fiber as well, typically 35g per day. I don’t know what else to do. Eating specific foods like prunes, kiwis, apples, etc are not helpful. I could eat a bowl of fruit for every meal and still be constipated. Please don’t say prune juice or fiber supplements. Even on a super high fiber plant-based diet I struggled with constipation. Coffee doesn’t work for me either. I drink it every morning. If anyone has any advice at all please share!

I wanna invite others into a discussion about how this HA from Nov 2024 could’ve occurred, and also welcome your experiences and thoughts of yours. 

Now, up until the year 2007-2008, I weighed about 350 pounds. Finally started going to the gym and dropped dramatic weight over the years. Up until the HA last Nov, I had been down over 100 pounds steadily for years. I had become basically an athlete. Lived an intermittent fasting lifestyle. Experimented with low carb to no carb diets on and off. Of course, I enjoyed my cheat days from time to time. I weighed around 230 pounds. 
The day of the HA, I was lifting 45-50lbs dumbbells over my head for seated shoulder presses. The weight was manageable enough, but nevertheless, slight struggle to put over my head, and made for a strenuous but manageable 10-15 reps. Without question, it for sure compressed and tightened my upper body, along probably with the two arteries that clogged, not to mention being on 300-400 mg of caffeine from my regular preworkout and morning coffee intake. It was a perfect storm. And right around then is when I felt the symptoms: blood rushing to my head, upper back radiating pain to the jaw, and nausea/dizziness. If you can believe it, I stubbornly went and did HIIT workouts some more before finally getting to the ER. 

What I’m trying to figure out is, is it possible that my HA was triggered right then spontaneously due to the combination of things going on with me in that workout that day? Or.. did that plaque gather over time and finally trigger the inevitable??

Something I’ve been wondering. If you got this far, do share your thoughts if any. It’s something I’m gonna bring up to my cardiologist next month. 

Best.

Which apparently is doing nothing.

I'm wondering if there's something about only having one jukebox per grid. I can down some coffee and figure out a way to switch them over, but thought I'd check if this was the case or whether the lack of sleep is just messing with my mind.",3,1750048186.0,spaceengineers,0,0.81,False

The crowd was still screaming when the lights faded in Tyler McAdams’s memory.

He could still hear the moment it all shattered — the crunch of the boards, the sharp pop in his knee, the sickening silence that followed when he didn’t get up. It played on repeat in his head, no matter how many times he tried to drown it out with noise, with sleep, with scotch.

That had been five months ago.

Now, the only sound was the low hum of the tram winding through the cobbled streets of Heidelberg, Germany. He sat by the window, one leg stretched out awkwardly in front of him — the good one — as the other stayed stiff and tightly wrapped in a brace, hidden beneath worn jeans. He hated how people still looked at him like he was a threat on the ice, like he was still that Tyler.

He wasn’t.

Tyler McAdams — NCAA leading scorer, projected number two NHL draft pick, golden boy of the Big Ten — had died on that rink in February. What was left was someone trying to remember who he was without a jersey on his back.

The tram slowed, squealing to a stop near Bismarckplatz. He grabbed his duffel and stepped off, exhaling as the sharp scent of roasted coffee and blooming spring flowers greeted him. Heidelberg was a postcard town — colorful baroque buildings, castle ruins high above the Neckar River, and old men who read newspapers in outdoor cafés like it was 1952.

It was the kind of place people came to find something — peace, inspiration, maybe even love. Tyler had come to lose something.

Regret.

He headed toward the art gallery a few blocks away. His uncle Peter had offered him a job there — part-time, mostly manual stuff, helping hang exhibits, carry crates, fix lighting. Anything to keep his mind occupied and his body moving without a stick in his hand.

The gallery was tucked between a bakery and a bookstore, a sleek, modern contrast to the town’s medieval charm. Inside, sunlight poured through the tall windows and splashed across the polished floors. Tyler exhaled, grateful for the quiet.

Then he saw her.

She was standing on a ladder, a brush in one hand, a smear of blue on her cheek. Her blond hair was twisted up in a messy knot, held together by a paintbrush that had no business staying balanced that perfectly. She wore overalls splattered with color, and she was humming — actually humming — some song he couldn’t name but never wanted to forget.

“Sasha,” his uncle called from behind the front desk. “Meet my nephew. He’ll be helping us out for the next few months.”

Sasha looked down, her eyes locking onto Tyler’s with an easy confidence that startled him.

“Ah,” she said, smiling. “The American.”

He offered a lazy smirk. “Guilty.”

She climbed down, and he realized she was taller than he expected — maybe it was the attitude. She extended a hand, and he took it, noticing how small it felt in his.

“Tyler,” he said.

“Sasha Becker,” she replied. “I’m the resident artist-slash-chaos-bringer.”

“And I guess I’m the clean-up crew.”

She laughed, and the sound slipped under his skin like a hook.

Peter cleared his throat, giving them both a look. “Try not to burn the place down.”

As Peter disappeared into the back, Sasha walked back toward her half-finished canvas — a wild mess of brushstrokes that somehow captured motion and silence all at once. Tyler watched her as she worked, her brow furrowed in focus.

“Nice piece,” he said.

She glanced at him. “Thanks. It’s about falling.”

“Falling?”

She dipped her brush in crimson and said without looking at him, “Yeah. Not the bad kind. The kind where you don’t know if you’re flying or crashing.”

Tyler didn’t answer, because that’s exactly what he felt like. Every day since the hit, since the surgery, since the letter from his agent that said, They’ve moved on, Ty. Teams want someone who can play right now.

Falling.

“Do you paint?” she asked suddenly.

“No,” he said, almost laughing. “I was more of a skates and shoulder checks kind of guy.”

“Ah,” she said, tilting her head. “The hockey player.”

He stiffened a little at that. The was went unspoken between them.

But Sasha didn’t press. She just nodded, like she understood how much someone could love something that didn’t love them back.

They worked in silence after that. Tyler moved crates. She painted. And every so often, he caught her looking at him — curious, almost shy, like she was trying not to ask something.

He should have ignored it.

But he didn’t.

Later, as they packed up for the day, he walked out with her into the golden light of late afternoon.

“You’re not from around here, obviously,” she said.

“Michigan,” he offered. “You?”

She gave him a sly smile. “Born here. But I’ve lived in Berlin, Paris… I like to move around. Stay too long, and things get complicated.”

He nodded. “I know that feeling.”

As they reached the corner, she paused. “I should go. My fiancé is probably wondering where I am.”

There it was — the word that slammed into his chest like a puck to the ribs.

“Right,” he said, trying not to flinch. “Of course.”

She didn’t seem to notice, or maybe she did and just didn’t care.

“See you tomorrow, Tyler.”

She walked away, and he stood there for a long time, watching her vanish into the crowd like a ghost.

Tyler wasn’t looking for anything when he came to Germany.

But as he turned to walk back to his tiny flat above the gallery, he already knew: something had found him.
