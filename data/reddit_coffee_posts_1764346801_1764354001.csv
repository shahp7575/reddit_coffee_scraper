1p91xyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Reviewer/comments/1p91xyk/is_avg_vpn_safe_to_use/,Is AVG VPN safe to use?,"I’ve been using AVG Antivirus for a while now, and recently I noticed they started promoting their VPN service in the app. I thought I’d give it a try since I’ve been wanting to use a VPN more often, especially on public Wi-Fi. I didn’t see much about it in the usual free VPN threads on Reddit, so I wasn’t really sure what to expect. The setup was super easy, and I liked that it runs quietly in the background without bombarding me with pop-ups. I tested it out while working at a coffee shop and streaming videos, and it didn’t slow down my connection, which was a nice surprise. However, as I read more about it, I saw a few people mentioning that AVG might log more data than other VPNs, which kind of defeats the purpose of using one in the first place, right? It got me thinking back to when I was looking for the best free VPN last year and realized that sometimes free options can be safer than paid ones, as long as you’re careful. Now I’m wondering, has anyone used AVG’s VPN long-term? Is it genuinely private, or just a decent option for casual use? If it’s not worth it, I’m considering switching to Proton or Windscribe.

1p91xcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1p91xcn/it_took_a_frustrating_lab_session_for_my_brain_to/,It took a frustrating lab session for my brain to finally 'get' the difference between math and physics.,"I was a physics major, but I was swimming in math classes that felt completely detached from reality. I'm talking about pure math, the kind with endless proofs and abstract structures. In that world, everything was perfect, logical, and clean. Every problem had a pristine, capital-T Truth waiting to be discovered. It was like building a flawless crystal palace in your mind. I loved it, but I couldn't see how it connected to the messy, chaotic world I was supposed to be studying in physics.

My professor, a guy with a wild beard and a permanent coffee stain on his shirt, tried to explain it with a classic analogy. He said, 'A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there. A physicist is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there, but every once in a while, he shouts *I found it!*' I chuckled, but I didn't truly get it.

Then came the advanced mechanics lab. We were tracking the decay of a particle's spin. My data points were all over the place. I spent hours trying to fit them to the elegant equation from the textbook, but they just wouldn't cooperate. There was noise, error, and what felt like pure, stubborn randomness. I was getting so frustrated, ready to throw my notebook across the room. My numbers were 'wrong,' the experiment was 'a failure.'

And then, standing there in the dim, humming light of the lab, it hit me. That was the whole point. The equation was the perfect, imaginary world of math. My messy graph was reality. My job as a physicist wasn't to find the 'perfect' answer but to find the 'best possible' description of this noisy reality. It was about looking at that chaotic mess of data points and shouting, 'Yep, that looks enough like an exponential decay curve! I found it!' That was the 'black cat.' It wasn't about perfection; it was about approximation, modeling, and making sense of the beautiful mess that is the universe.

That realization completely changed how I saw my major. Math is the perfect language we use to describe things, but physics is the messy, creative, and often frustrating art of translating the real world into that language. It's about finding the cat that isn't really there, but whose shadow is close enough to be incredibly useful.

We’ve been together for three years, and for most of it things felt solid. He remembered my coffee order, sent dumb 2 AM memes, and made everything feel easy..........

Lately he’s been distant. Always on his phone, canceling plans, saying it was “work,” but it didn’t really look like work. Last week I grabbed his phone to show him a dog video, and a text from his ex popped up: “Miss our late nights ❤️.” My stomach just dropped. He said it was nothing and that she was “just being friendly” after running into her at the gym. But this is the ex he dated for two years and used to post everywhere. I’m curvier and insecure sometimes, so that message hit hard......

I confronted him and completely spiraled. He got defensive, called me paranoid, and walked out. The next day I packed a bag, went to my sister’s, and told him it was over. I blocked him on everything.......

It’s been five days and I’m a mess. Crying at work, checking his LinkedIn like an idiot 🙄🙄🙄, missing his smile and the way he’d pull me in after arguments.

Basically you can put those keurig cups into one thing, or there is a similarly shaped thing for coffee grounds, a filter. So I did it as the instructions with the coffee maker said, used the filter as instructed. I didn’t love the taste, I drank about half of it, all I have to add is sugar, no milk or creamer at the moment. When I poured it out there was a lot of dark sediment in the bottom of the cup. So today I ripped the edges off a full sized coffee filter, the white paper things, and used that along with the filter that came with the single cup coffee maker. It came out much more clear, no sediment, and tastes a lot better. But I am wondering, would I still get the benefits from doing it like that? Am I losing a lot of the mushrooms by, idk, double filtering it? 2 days ago it was very dark, like coffee, today it was a bit more clear, kinda like tea, dark brown tea.

I always thought I had “no motivation” or “stress issues,” but it turned out I was just sleeping at random times and staring at my phone until 2 AM.
Once I fixed my routine, my mood, focus, and energy changed way more than I expected.

Things I learned the hard way:
- Your brain only does its “clean up” work during deep sleep.
- Scrolling reels/shorts before bed kills deep sleep.
- Even one bad night makes you more anxious, emotional, and unfocused the next day.
- Waking up at the same time every day helps more than sleeping extra on weekends.

What actually helped:
- No phone for the last hour before bed.
- Sleeping and waking up at roughly the same time.
- No coffee after 2 PM.
- Keeping my room dark and cool.

Why this matters:
When your sleep improves, your mood, energy, focus, patience, and even your confidence improve with it. It’s honestly one of the easiest “fixes” that most of us ignore.",48,1764352892.0,YouShouldKnow,2,0.88,False

Used r/Laredo as a guide to make the most of less than 72 hours in town — mainly food focused bc this was a work trip. 

Sharing highlights for your reactions,  thoughts and advice to help future Laredo visitors. 

Highlights, in order of awesome: 

1. Organic Man Coffee — outstanding!   Among the best coffee in the world. Tranquil atmosphere.  True oasis.  

2. Saludo’s Brewing Co - exceptionally friendly bar staff.  Truly, these folks are great.  Pizza with Lowpoint BBQ toppings was fantastic.   Especially loved the Hefeweizen and Cookies & Cream Stout — highly recommend that as a dessert.  Far better on draft than from the cans.  

3. Magaly’s Imported Art - Super fun place with well-crafted metal art and GREAT prices.   One could make a great business buying up their inventory, driving it up north and selling it for 3-5x markup.   Picked up a meaningful Xmas gifts for my family — was genuinely surprised by this place.   Bring cash.  Very nice people.  

3. Taco Palenque (San Bernardo) — redditors say the South side locations were the best.  Not sure if this location counts as south, but solid. 

4. Rudy’s BBQ - folks recommended Lowpoint but needed WiFi and a place to work/watch football.  Good value and the portions — at least compared to places like Dallas, Nashville, and cities in the North East.  Average brisket.  

5. Dark Rock Coffee - very nice team with kind service, this stand in the Outlet Mall is worth patronizing if you’re in the mall.  Variety of beverages and seasonal menu will have something for everyone, even non-coffee drinkers.   

6. Laguna’s Marisco & Sushi — this choice was forced by what was open and still serving food that interested those in my group.  We arrived 1 hour and 45 minutes before closing time and were just happy to have a real meal after a long day.  Superb ceviche and fish tacos!  The pineapple cocktail and any drinks using higher quality tequila were good.  Other drinks and appetizers were misses. The team was very nice to let us finish our meal after they had closed and were cleaning up. 

7. Outlet Mall - it’s a mall but there’s a few unique stores.  Best part was the market on Saturday morning with local vendors, singers and a talent show of some sort.  Simply wish the mall would turn off the loudspeaker mall music when the local musicians are playing with speakers.   At different points, there’s a literal cacophony of conflicting music from 2 or 3 sources.    If the locals are playing, at least turn off the mall music.  Even better, put the live music on the mall speakers!

I chase him around the garden daily to the housekeeper's cries of 'Colin, I don't think the cat is playing!' While the housekeeper is slow on the uptake most of the time, she's correct in this claim. Unfortunately, The Plague is young and limber and difficult to pin down for lessons. 

The Fat Man, of course, since he's a species traitor, does chase The Plague around in the garden in a playful manner. This does not help matters. He also ignores the barking and the borthole sniffing. It would take one swipe of his powerful claws to end the discussion, but no. He can't be bothered to keep up fine feline traditions. 

I have in the meantime called a truce with the malodorous beast Thorben. Since he's also suffering under the paw of The Plague, I've taken to giving him the occasional companionable headbutt. For reasons beyond even my advanced understanding, this does not bring him comfort. Instead of basking in the light of my attentions, he screams and hides behind the housekeeper. I'll never understand the inner workings of that particular dog. 

The housekeeper still constantly accuses me of being a cloaca and following The Plague around to torture him. I can't imagine why. It's not my fault he happens to be there when I happen to be walking in the same direction as him and that this happens several times a day. I most certainly do not follow him around and scream at him. As we all know, she's the cloaca in this instance (as is the dog for rejecting my friendship, and the Fat Man for being a disappointment to cats everywhere).

*We don't need to do the snow-room idea after all,* I thought. 

Because it was likely warm enough to step outside and collect the falling water. 

The others hadn't realised this yet. 

Although there wasn't a need to hurry upstairs, since cancelling the snow-room idea was as easy as making sure the window in Jake's room remained shut, I hurried out of the living room at a brisk walk anyway. 

""Soup's ready,"" said Georgia from the kitchen as I passed by.

""I'll be down in a minute,"" I said, not stopping. 

I found Ben, Oscar, Jack, and Eddie standing outside Jake's bedroom examining the door. 

""Guys,"" I said, a little breathless, ""We don't need to do the snow-room idea."" 

I went about explaining how the back garden was different, going so far as to have them all stand at Jake's bedroom window and looking out to the garden. 

""What if it stops snowing?"" said Eddie. 

""Then the idea won't work anyway,"" I said. 

I watched as Eddie moved his phone camera from my face. He roamed the camera to record the back garden from Jake's bedroom window instead. 

""So we can grab some bowls and buckets,"" said Ben, ""And put them outside."" 

""Yeah,"" said Eddie, ""But who's going outside this time?"" 

""I'll do it,"" I said. 

This earned fresh incredulous looks from the others. 

""But only if it's warm enough,"" I said.

Jack patted me on the shoulder encouragingly. 

With this decision made, we all made our way downstairs again. 

When we all reached the kitchen doorway only Phillip was standing in the kitchen slurping at his own bowl of hot tomato soup. He seemed to pay us no attention, and the rest of us carried on into the living room. 

Gary hadn't moved from where he was blacked out. 

Also in the room, each with a piece of dumpling and their own bowl of soup, was Ellie, Georgia, Megan, and Rebecca. The cats were curled up beneath the coffee table, and the shaggy dog sat on the sofa next to Georgia with his chin on her lap. 

""There's a pot of soup in the kitchen,"" said Georgia, ""Help yourselves, we've set bowls out."" 

Before I could even begin to question whether the guys wanted to put the going outside plan on hold, they all hurried off into the kitchen. After forming an orderly line, of which I was last, each of the guys filled a plastic bowl with tomato-flavoured soup. 

There was just enough soup to fill half of my plastic bowl when it was finally my turn. I was feeling incredibly hungry, and doubted I had ever wanted soup more in my life. 

There was, also, a second, empty pot off to the side filled with dregs of what appeared to be a different soup. 

All the guys had left the kitchen to go eat in the living room. 

I turned around, and saw Dave sat at a computer chair beside Mark's bed with a bowl of soup in his hands. He was in the middle of bringing the soup to Mark's mouth and slowly pouring it in.

Mark's frostbitten face was fixed with nasty shades of red, yellows, and purples. And the sound of his weak slurping, which was clearly agony for him, made me wince. 

""Did you get any soup, Dave?"" I said.

""Yeah, had mine, thanks,"" said Dave. 

Knowing I wasn't taking the last of the soup from someone else, I filled my bowl with what remained.

It was noticeably lukewarm in the living room, due to everyone sitting inside and the new heat radiating from the Heart Tree. 

I sat cross-legged on the carpet by the coffee table, and brought the soup bowl to my mouth. The soup, though thin and watery, was bliss, and shortly after I finished it and put the bowl aside, all thought of venturing outside to get water vanished from my mind. 

Instead, tiredness gripped me, and all the quiet conversation around me became unintelligible. I slept as if I were on a long coach journey – vaguely aware of my surroundings, and a growing cramp in my neck. At some point I decided to use the coffee table in combination with my arms as a headrest, and then real, genuine sleep found me. 

When I woke up sometime later, it was to the sound of someone shouting.

I snapped my head up, and saw that bright white daylight was peeking in behind the sliding-glass door curtain. 

""Ellie! Ellie!!"" the voice that had woken me up continued to shout. 

The shouting was muffled, coming from another room, and I realised it was Dave. 

Bodies rose from the sofas and rushed by me, and after a few moments of being utterly confused and afraid, I came to my senses enough to stand up. 

Whilst wiping sleep-crust out of my eyes and saliva from my chin, I made my way into the kitchen.

Most of the others were in there already, and were blocking the way to Mark's bedroom. 

Georgia was crying. She turned and brushed by me, and Megan, also crying, followed after her. 

Eddie, in turn, chased after Megan. 

Phillip, who was standing by the kitchen sink and was close to the back of everyone stuffed into the kitchen, had his hands held to his mouth and his face looked incredibly pale. 

Dave was knelt on the floor and was sobbing uncontrollably, and Ellie was sitting on the edge of Mark's bed. Her fingers were pulling away from Mark's throat.

Mark's eyes were open, bloodshot, and staring at the ceiling. 

And his red-raw mouth, with its rotting lips, was leaking a thick, frothy bile.

Dave flung himself onto Mark's chest. 

""No, please, no,"" Dave choked between more sobs, as if there might be someone or something that could stop his brother from being dead.

**Why This Pick?**

 

With the Sabres having put 15 goals in the bag across their last 3 outings, I think this game total trends North early on. The Devils have scored at least 3 goals in each of their last 3 games, and the Buffalo offense tends to play considerably better at home than they do on the road. This encounter should see at least 7; I’m on the Over to cash.

1p917m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1p917m9/looking_for_feedback_on_this_hypothetical_first/,Looking for feedback on this hypothetical first chapter of a fanfic that I have planned about writing,"      Oscar Diaz had never intended this. He never intended for it to be this way. Originally, he had it all planned out: get jumped out, leave Freeridge, go to Bakersfield to see Ray, try to make Cesar come with him and build the life he desperately wanted; own a house, maybe have a wife, a child, become the chef he always wanted to be and not the new leader of the Santos, have normal adult problems instead of gang problems, worry about normal things like paying the bills, buying new furniture, instead of the homies getting sprayed by the Prophet$ out in the front lawn, or 19th Street holding a gun to the head asking for money…he had a plan and was going to stick with it, even if he didn’t know the next step after the first initial step, wasn’t sure if he would be able to survive the beating that he was going to take for himself- and secretly- for Cesar. 
      But one thought he had a week before, when he was planning on telling Cesar about it and getting jumped out after, one thought changed everything; just that one thought. 
      He realized that- in the moment sitting at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee that he every ten seconds took a sip off as he sat there with the injuries still visibly there that had been given to him by 19th street after the whole Cuchillos ordeal- that he had never lived a normal life; or to simply put it, he had never lived a life of normalcy; their father, Ray, in and out of his life as a child, barely in Cesar’s childhood years, goes to prison for twelve years, no note, no call, comes back for a few days after his prison release, only to go to Bakersfield to start a new life there; their mother, Lydia, deadbeat junkie who was never there for neither of them, the reason why Oscar didn’t pursue the magnet school in Pasadena because he could never trust her with Cesar, overdosed on heroin many years ago, when Oscar was fifteen and Cesar was seven, her death the reason why he joined the gang in the first place; not just to provide and raise Cesar, but to protect him too. From the dangers of Freeridge. From the dangers of the gang life. 	
      From everything. 
	He realized that he had not only never lived a life of normalcy but that he also didn’t know what normalcy looked like, and didn’t know how to achieve that even after getting jumped out, possibly going to Bakersfield for rehab, getting his dream job, leaving the gang life, and getting the wife and kid he desperately wanted; how could he find it? How could he understand normalcy? How could he leave and kill Spooky and become Oscar, the old, sweet, little boy Oscar, and the adult, chef Oscar with the stable family he dreamed of yet never had? 
	And so, that one thought told him only one simple thing about the wars he was facing mentally: leave. Just leave. At least temporarily. Leave Freeridge for a bit, maybe leave California too, and see what the real world is like, at least for a few months, then come back, get jumped out, take Cesar, and build their new lives out of the gang and Freeridge, that way he’ll have a more solid plan, know what step he’ll take next. 
	And yeah, maybe that was a ridiculous thought: to leave and go on a short-term vacation, but it started to make sense. Not just for himself, but for Cesar too. After that new thought came to him, he started to realize something he didn’t want to realize due to the new optimistic way of life he had gained for the future after Cuchillos’s death and the peace truce with 19th Street, ending gang conflicts in Freeridge temporarily: Cesar was turning into him. He was becoming more and more Lil Spooky, as the days passed; he was colder, harder, more calculated, less fearful; new traits Oscar was trying to be blinded to because he strongly believed Cesar would listen and come with him, but couldn’t anymore. He was losing his little brother; the one who dreamed to go to UCLA, become an architect, have a life outside of Freeridge, never dare enter the gang life that claimed Oscar, Ray, and the other men in their family, build that beach house he talked about with Oscar once at the beach, where downstairs would be Oscar’s restaurant, and upstairs would be their home, their home filled with the dreams they finally accomplished, was slowly losing himself and his humanity and becoming the mini-version of Oscar, that Oscar didn’t want to be anymore: Lil Spooky the gangster; the next Santo after Spooky, the one who would control the entire block and the gang: the new leader. 
	So with Cesar added to the list, he decided it wasn’t a ridiculous thought at all. So, he ditched the original plan and began formulating the new, temporary plan: he’d go to Portland, Oregon for at least two or three months- three months at most- come back, get jumped, be able to convince Cesar to come with him, leave Freeridge, and build their new life together. All he needed was time to fully formulate, convince, and plan out his plan for the future. All he needed was to leave for a while. But he couldn’t do this by himself, he couldn’t leave with only himself and his thoughts on board: he needed someone to come with him. Someone who also wanted out but didn’t know where to start. 
	But who could it be? 
	It definitely wasn’t Joker or Sad Eyes, any of the other Santos members he saw daily, but maybe someone who wasn’t part of the everyday-circle, someone who worked afar and for the former gang leader before him, one of the many bodyguard of Cuchillos that he would see whenever he had a meeting with her, one of the many bald, tall men with diamond earrings just like him, except who wore their perfect suits and tie, and tattoos that proved their affiliation and loyalty to Cuchillos and the gang, a face he saw out of the many of them: Poste. The guy he remembered and had seen whenever he met with Cuchillos was Poste, one of her taller and muscular bodyguards that she always liked to keep by her side…Poste, that was his guy. But the thing is that he never talked to Poste; never had a legitimate conversation with him, not just for wanting out, but for anything; yet he knew whenever he caught glimpses of the guy and sometimes made eye contact with him that there was a sense of sadness in his eyes, a sign that he wanted out, but couldn’t- at least when Cuchillos was still alive. So, from gathering his information and whereabouts from others, he met with the guy, who was lost as the other bodyguards were after Cuchillos’s death, and whom treated Oscar, the new leader, as his new boss and stared at him with the full respect of a bodyguard, where Oscar talked to him straightforwardly about getting out, about leaving, about going to Portland for a bit, be not only his bodyguard but also figure out what he wanted too. Would he like that? Poste- or Eduardo Martinez, his real name Oscar had learned to be- agreed, and together they both scheduled the night they would leave Freeridge, South Central Los Angeles, and go to Portland, Oregon for the next two to three- at least three months, then return to Freeridge and go ahead with solving their problems of leaving the gang, but this time knowing what the future will hold; so at that same meeting, they planned their getaway plan: they would leave Freeridge in two weeks, Eddie would show up to the Diaz house at 12 A.M. when Cesar was definitely asleep in bed, and once Eddie had texted Oscar that he was outside, he’d get out, albeit quietly to not awake his little brother, and they would drive off in Oscar’s 1966 Red Chevy Impala. Yet before their scheduled escape plan happened, they needed to keep everything hush-hush. They could not tell anyone they were going to do this; to Sad Eyes, Joker, the other members, and especially Cesar. Oscar could not tell Cesar he was going to temporarily leave him. Furthermore, after they exchanged contacts and their meeting ended, both Oscar and Eddie pretended like everything was the same and nothing major like that was going to happen. For two weeks, Spooky sat on the couch with Lil Spooky outside in the front lawn of the Diaz house with the other Santos members, pretending like everything was the same; trying to spend as much time with Lil Spooky before he left. There were a few moments when he almost let it slip to Cesar, telling him to take care of the house, the gang, until he came back. But he never once opened his mouth, he completely zipped it up. He had to though, it was difficult, but he had to, the whole reason this plan came to be was because of Cesar, it was for Cesar, so that Oscar could give him the better life that the hood and Santos couldn’t give them. And two weeks later, on an early August Friday night, the escape plan came to be. Eddie walked up to the Diaz house from the apartment he shared with the other gangster bodyguards which was a few blocks down, waiting for Oscar next to the Impala with a few items of his in hand. Oscar didn’t pack much; he stuffed half his wardrobe into a small suitcase and grabbed most of the drug money he made as his source of currency. There was no RollerWorld money, or Cuchillos’s for that matter, as the drug money he had was enough to last him for three months. Along with the suitcase, he also took his memory box that he kept in his bedroom, the one that contained childhood memories and photos, and a few childhood favorites such as his Dodgers player bobblehead and toys. He passed Cesar’s bedroom quietly, who was knocked out, drooling, with his phone still in his hand. Oscar stood in the doorway, looking at him for a bit, despite having received Eddie’s message that he was here. Yet he stood in that doorway for five minutes, watching him, half of him telling him to leave him alone and go, the other telling him this was a stupid plan and to abandon it. And, for a minute, he thought about abandoning this plan. Because by leaving, he wasn’t just leaving Freeridge or the Santos, but Cesar, his kid brother, his whole world, his everything: he was abandoning Cesar. He wanted Cesar to wake up, to ask him what he was doing, to make him stay, but none of that ever happened. He couldn’t move a single muscle in his body. He wanted to wake Cesar up, tell him what he was doing, that he’d come back when he knows and understands the real world, that he was doing this for him, but again, none of that happened. He promised himself not to tell Cesar. That he’d be okay in those three months. Hopefully, he’d realize during the time Oscar was gone, that maybe the gang life was wrong, being Lil Spooky was wrong, and to rethink his future, go to UCLA, and become the architect he always wanted to be. Maybe he’d think that. He hopefully would. On the bright side, he had Ruby, Jamal, and Monse- who wasn’t in Freeridge anymore due to some academy on the East Coast, but still, he had people to support and help him out. He wasn’t going to be alone, he would never be alone. Oscar stood in that doorway for what felt like an eternity, and finally went outside and saw Poste, who was leaving in the Impala, arms crossed, waiting for him. 
	“Kid’s asleep, Jefe?” Eddie asked him in Spanish. 
	“Yeah,” Oscar replied, sort of dazed. “He doesn’t know anything.” 
	They put their belongings into the trunk, Oscar thinking if he should at least leave a goodbye note before leaving, yet after doing so, they settled inside: Eddie at the wheel, and Oscar at the passenger’s seat. Usually, he would drive, given it was his car, but he wasn’t much in the mood to drive, so he let Eddie do it, who was already ready to drive instead of Oscar. 
	As Eddie set his phone to give the directions to Portland, Oregon, a new thought came to Oscar again; however this time it wasn’t about Cesar, the gang, or the jump out: Maine. They should go to Portland, Maine instead of Portland, Oregon. 
	“Poste,” Spooky said in Spanish, Oscar hidden. “Change of plan, we’re heading to Portland, Maine. Not Oregon.” 
	“Sí, Jefe,” Poste replied, no questions asked. And, just like that, they headed out into the night, the WELCOME TO FREERIDGE sign past them a couple of minutes later, as Siri gave the directions to Portland, Maine; where they would be staying for the next three months, putting a pause on the present temporarily, as thoughts shifted dreams of the future: a normal, stable life outside of gangland; with his own house, Cesar, the wife, the kid, all there as he cooked dinner in his chef’s coat in the kitchen. That life.

He was in my city (let’s call it Narnia) for a master’s program. I knew it probably wouldn’t turn into anything long-term since he was younger, moving around for school, and figuring out his next steps… we were in different places, but genuinely enjoyed each other, had a lot in common, heaps of connection and chemistry.

We stayed in touch after he left, and I even visited him once. Nothing dramatic ended it, but it faded in a sort of sad and bitter way (as I suspected would happen, bc of the aforementioned).

We both moved on, got new partners, and only saw each other’s lives through occasional glimpses on social media.

Three years later, completely out of nowhere, we ran into each other in a supermarket back in Narnia (where I was still living). He had moved back for work that very weekend, and I was actually leaving Narnia that very same weekend for a new job in a new city. It was such an unexpected encounter - we exchanged a quick hello/update, then moved on.

Since then, I’ve broken up with my ex (and still live in the new town I’d moved away to).

About three weeks ago, I got a totally out of the blue message from him asking me how I am, saying he thinks about me all the time, never forgot me, and always wondered “what if.” (The supermarket meet up was 2 years ago, btw - and now we are 33 and 30).

I don’t live in Narnia anymore, but on the exact day he messaged me, I happened to en route back there for a week long work trip. I debated replying, but eventually did and asked if he wanted to get coffee.

We met up and ended up talking for hours. The connection came back instantly.

Here’s the catch: he’s still with his girlfriend. He says they’re in a dead, loveless relationship, in the throes of breaking up, but it’s messy because they live together and are stuck in a lease. I’ve been in that situation before so I get how slow and complicated the end stage can be.

I told him I’m not going to cheat or entertain anything romantic until he’s fully out of that relationship. He said understands completely.

I know I need to be careful. But the spark is still very real, and we have so much in common.

I’m not even sure what kind of advice I’m looking for. Just wondering if anyone else has been in a situation like this, where someone from your past reappears (and it’s kinda messy?).",5,1764352051.0,AskWomenOver30,20,0.86,False

I am a chronic polite smiler. Cashier hands me the receipt, I smile. Man on the street makes awkward eye contact, I smile. Coworkers I barely know in the hallway, I smile so hard my cheeks actually hurt sometimes. It hit me one day that half of these smiles are not for me at all. They are like this automatic little apology for existing in public as a woman. So last week I decided to run a tiny experiment and only smile when I genuinely felt it. No more reflex polite face.

Instantly I noticed how many interactions basically depended on me performing this little friendly girl routine. One guy at the coffee shop who loves to call me sweetheart suddenly got very short when I just gave a neutral face and a simple ""thanks"". A man at the bus stop tried to chat and I answered, but without the usual softening smile, and he literally said I was ""kinda cold today"". On the other hand a woman in my building actually opened up more when I just looked neutral but present and said hi without plastering a grin on. We ended up walking together to the metro talking about how tired we were.

By day five I realized how exhausting it had been to constantly manage other peoples comfort with my facial expressions. I still smiled at the barista I like, at a little kid in the elevator, at my friends of course. But it felt like those smiles belonged to me again, not to some invisible rule. I dont think I can unsee it now. Curious if anyone else has tried something like this or noticed how much you modulate your face in public just to seem safe and non threatening.

[**AITA for telling my sister we were strangers after she eloped and broke all contact with us years ago?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p4qex4/aita_for_telling_my_sister_we_were_strangers/)

Apologies in advance if this post seems disorganized, my head is still reeling from all this. 9 years ago ( I was 18 then) my older sister eloped with her then boyfriend. Our parents (we're an immigrant family) were vehemently opposed to her relationship, I remember me being ok with it personally, it wasn't my place. She eloped with her boyfriend and cut of all contact with us. 

My parents were besides themselves. I tried reaching out to her back then on different platforms but was blocked. I even reached out to her best friends and asked them if they could at least get me in touch with her, they said she didn't know where she lived now, but that she'd told them she was happy. She had also left her workplace. Eventually we all (me and my parents) came to like an unspoken agreement to pretend she was never here, and I blocked her everywhere too. 

I remember being extra particular to call regularly when I was in college because I was worried about their state of mind. We're now at a place where I can't remember the last time she crossed our minds.

Yesterday my sister knocked on my apartment door. She cried and hugged me when she saw me, I hugged her back initially too, I wasn't really thinking at the time. She was just going on about how much I had changed, how much she'd missed me all these years. Eventually I kind of remembered everything, and asked her why she was here, and who had given her my address. 

She said she had swore to them that she wouldnt tell. I asked her why didn't she call first since whoever gave my address probably gave my number too, she said she just wanted to see me in person. I told her we'd gotten over her, why was she here. She said her issue had only been with our parents, not me, I told her about how I'd been blocked too by her when she left. 

She told me she was sorry she'd hurt me, but she had wanted a fresh start, told me I was an uncle to a nephew and a niece (they weren't there at the time, they were at their father's, they recently divorced). She acted surprised that I wouldn't know, said she'd told someone to tell our parents about them.

Maybe it was hearing about the divorce that furstrated me more, because if we were going to have gone through all this pain, at least she could've found lasting happiness, I just told her she was a stranger to me now. She said we could have lunch together she wanted to know all about what I'd been up to, I told her it was best if we continued to have no contact, she didn't act like an older sister when I needed her to, and that we were no longer family, we'd mourned her already and we were now strangers. She was tearful, she gave me her address and phone number and left.

Last night, I spoke to my girlfriend about what had happened. She said she was still my sister, that I shouldn't have just turned her away. I told her she didnt know what we'd gone through in the days after she had eloped. But I still wanted to know here AITA?

I'm sorry if I sound pointed but I haven't had to remember all the bs I went through in the aftermath of her elopement in a while and its just crazy how she just ditched us all.

[**Update : AITA for telling my sister we were strangers after she broke all contact with us**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p8dsvg/update_aita_for_telling_my_sister_we_were/)

Hi. Thanks a lot to everyone for the support in my post. And to those who reached out for support. I'd been emotionally drained almost after meeting my sister. Like I said I had made my peace, after a lot of hurt and futile hope, that I would never see her again.

She had my number, and I hadn't blocked the new number of hers. I'd thought about it, and received advice to, but I just didn't, it slipped from my mind. She asked me on Tuesday how I was doing, and asked if we could meet on Wednesday, she really wanted me to meet her kids. I was really conflicted, I didn't want to oblige her, but I decided to say yes to at least meet them.

I went to her apartment yesterday and met my niece and nephew. My niece had recently turned 9 and my nephew is 6. They're great kids and I really enjoyed seeing them. I remember feeling a certain way when my sister was introducing me and she told him, that the way he's my niece's younger brother, similarly I'm her younger brother. We talked a bit, and started talking about stories from us growing up. 

I hadn’t and still haven't said everything's ok between us, but our stories and conversation went smoothly. I learned that after she eloped and got married she had moved in with her husband into his place in a town a few hours away from us. That around 2019 they had had moved to the city we were currently in (according to her she didn't know all this time that I later moved here for work after college too). I told her about what I'd been up to all these years, my college, my job, my girlfriend etc.

After that, the kids were in their room and my sister brought up us all doing something again over the weekend. I told her we werent ok, she can't expect me to forget everything. She said she was sorry that her moving out had nothing to do with me, that she missed me. I was angry at the fact that she had no idea the pain I'd gone through both personally and then having to be the crutch for my parents pain. 

I told her I didn't believe her that she would've been perfectly fine with never seeing me again if she hadnt gotten divorced, that I could've been dead and she probably wouldnt have broken a sweat upon learning it since she was so blissed out from her domestic life. I know it was ugly, I've never said anything like this but in that moment I just wanted her to feel some kind of hurt of the kind she'd given me. 

She broke down and said I can hate her if I want but to just not hate her forever, there has to be a limit. I regretted saying what I said when I saw her crying so I just sat next to her and asked about why they'd divorced.

She told me that their life had been going alright the first few years. She said she'd even sent word through a mutual when the kids were born (which either the mutual messed up or my sister did because we never heard about it). She said when covid happened her marriage became hell for her, that it had uncovered a side of her ex she never knew. 

He became abusive, had disdain for their son, revealed he used to record every single conversation of theirs, had convinced her she was crazy and a bad wife and mother. That she stuck with him because of the kids until she had enough, that a very good neighbor of theirs whom she had become friends with gave her a lot of support and even helped line her up with a job. During all this she even blamed our parents for her sticking with the marriage for so long and for not reaching out. 

I told her they had literally pleaded with her not to do this, I was there, I was 18 not 8. She said they told her she was dead to them if she ran off with him and so she blamed them for her not being able to leave him. I told her that was insane logic and she just didnt want to talk about them and asked me not to tell them about her. I said yeah her relationship with them is her own.

I also asked her who had given her my address, she begged me not to ask her that, that they hadnt given it easily she'd had to swear secrecy, and cry and convince them that I'd want to see my older sister, so I dropped it.

We had tea and snacks after that she asked me again if I wanted to do anything this weekend since she has the kids or we could do somethimg the weekend after just the two of us, I said I don't know. She was ok with that answer. She was tearful again when I was leaving, we hugged and I hugged the kids goodbye too.

My mind has been a mess since then. I lashed out and everything, but also regret what I said, but then I also try to remember how I had felt back then and then get angry again. It feels so weird knowing that shes now 20 minutes away from me and we can visit whenever. I told my girlfriend about all this, she said she supports me no matter what but in her opinion to consider the weekend plan with a cool mind.

This got long, I apologize but Ive been trying to collect my own thoughts on this and writing this just seemed to help. Thanks for the help.

--------------------------------------------------------------

More homeowners are looking for a unique combination of rustic charm and modern convenience in their dream homes. If you're considering a barndominium, designing one with wrap-around porch plans can be an excellent way to embrace this trend. A wrap-around porch not only adds to the visual appeal of your barndominium but also increases the usable outdoor space, making it perfect for relaxing or entertaining guests.

When starting the design process, think about how you'll use the porch. A wrap-around porch can serve multiple purposes. Here are some ideas to inspire your design:

- **Relaxation Zone:** Set up comfortable seating areas where you can unwind with a book or enjoy a morning coffee.
- **Entertainment Space:** Designate a section for outdoor dining or hosting gatherings. You could include a grill or even an outdoor kitchen.
- **Garden Escape:** Incorporate planters and flowers to create a beautiful garden area right outside your home.
- **Outdoor Living Room:** Create a cozy nook with chairs and a fire pit for evenings spent under the stars.

Next, consider the architectural style of your barndominium. A wrap-around porch can complement various styles, depending on the materials you choose. For a modern look, use sleek metal railings and clean lines. If you're going for a more rustic vibe, wooden posts with a natural finish can enhance the charm. Think about how the porch will integrate with the overall layout of your barndominium. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- **Balance and Proportion:** Ensure the porch size is in harmony with the main structure. A large barndominium could benefit from an expansive porch, while a smaller home may need a more modest design.
- **Accessibility:** Make sure your porch design allows easy access from inside the home. Consider door placements and traffic flow to create a seamless transition.
- **Roofing Options:** A covered porch is a great way to enjoy the outdoors even in less-than-ideal weather. Think about using large overhangs to provide shade in summer.

One essential aspect of any design is the materials you plan to use. Barndominiums typically feature metal and wood, but you can incorporate a variety of elements for your porch. Consider the following:

- **Wood:** Popular choices include cedar, pine, and redwood, which can be treated for durability and resistance to the elements.
- **Composite Materials:** For a low-maintenance option, composites or synthetic materials resemble wood but resist fading, warping, and pests.
- **Metal Accents:** Using steel railings or tin roofing can add to the sleek, modern appeal of your barndominium while staying true to the barn aesthetic.

After finalizing your design, it’s important to think about the practical aspects of your wrap-around porch. Indeed, construction and maintenance can be different for a porch versus the main structure. Here are a few practical considerations:

- **Building Codes:** Research local regulations regarding porch sizes and designs. Adherence to building codes is crucial, as it affects safety and resale value.
- **Permits:** Obtain the necessary permits before construction begins to avoid legal issues later on.
- **Maintenance:** Plan for ongoing maintenance like staining or sealing wood, and routine inspections to ensure the integrity of the structure.

Lighting is another key feature that enhances the appeal and functionality of your porch. Consider installing fixtures that complement your style, from rustic lanterns to sleek modern lights. Here are some options:

- **String Lights:** These can create a relaxed atmosphere for evening gatherings.
- **Recessed Lighting:** This type can provide subtle illumination, making the area usable at night without overwhelming brightness.
- **Ceiling Fans:** Fans can help reduce heat and make the space more comfortable, especially in warmer months.

Ultimately, designing your dream barndominium with wrap-around porch plans is about creating a space that reflects your lifestyle and aesthetic. By considering the layout, materials, and practical aspects, you can create a beautiful and functional outdoor space that will enhance your living experience. Embrace the flexibility of design and let your imagination run wild as you plan your ideal retreat.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a barndominium offers a unique blend of space, design, and lifestyle that is becoming increasingly popular among homeowners. If you’re considering this style of home, you’ll discover many advantages that cater to modern living while maintaining rustic charm.

### Spacious Living

One of the most attractive features of barndominiums is their spacious interiors. You can easily customize the layout to fit your needs. Here are some benefits of the generous space:

- **Open Floor Plans:** Most barndominiums feature open layouts that make the interiors feel airy and bright. This design encourages social interaction and makes it easy to entertain guests.
- **Room for Customization:** With plenty of square footage, you can create distinct areas for living, dining, and working without feeling cramped.
- **Storage Solutions:** Many designs offer ample storage options, whether through built-in cabinetry or dedicated storage rooms.

### Unique Design Aesthetics

Barndominiums stand out due to their distinctive architectural style, which combines elements of barns with modern home design. This unique aesthetic offers various benefits:

- **Stylish Exterior:** The metal and wood combination creates a rustic yet contemporary look that is visually appealing.
- **Endless Design Options:** You have the flexibility to choose colors, layouts, and finishes that suit your style, whether it's modern, rustic, or industrial.
- **Durability and Low Maintenance:** Made from metal and other hardy materials, barndominiums can withstand harsh weather and require less maintenance than traditional homes.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Barndominiums can also be budget-friendly. Here’s how:

- **Lower Construction Costs:** Building a barndominium is typically less expensive than other residential options. The straightforward structure often means lower labor costs.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums incorporate energy-efficient designs and materials, leading to lower utility bills.
- **Versatile Usage:** The extra space allows for various uses. You can incorporate a workshop, studio, or even a guest suite right in your home, reducing the need for separate buildings.

### Active Lifestyle and Community

Choosing to live in a barndominium often means embracing a more active lifestyle. Many barndominium owners choose rural or semi-rural locations, which provide ample opportunities for outdoor activities:

- **Proximity to Nature:** Enjoy hiking, biking, and other outdoor activities right at your doorstep.
- **Gardening Space:** Many barndominiums come with substantial plots of land, perfect for growing your own vegetables or flowers.
- **Community Engagement:** Living in rural areas often provides a close-knit community where everyone knows each other and supports local efforts.

### Flexibility for Future Needs

Barndominiums offer a flexible living space, which is especially beneficial if your needs change over time. Consider the following:

- **Room to Grow:** If you plan to expand your family or start a home business, the open space allows for easy modifications.
- **Multi-Generational Living:** The layout can be adapted for families who want to care for elderly parents or young adults moving back home.
- **Investment Opportunity:** As barndominiums become more popular, they may increase in value, making them a wise investment choice.

Ultimately, the benefits of living in a barndominium extend beyond just the physical space you inhabit. They encompass a lifestyle choice that values community, design flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. For anyone contemplating this living arrangement, the possibilities are endless. You can create a warm, welcoming home that suits your lifestyle while enjoying the unique advantages that come with the barndominium experience.

I just wanted to share something I’m really excited about. I’ve been working on a hotel website for a while, and I finally completed a **fully functional hotel management system using Payload CMS** , and honestly, I’m so happy with how everything turned out.

With Payload, I was able to handle:

* Dynamic room creation
* Room categories & pricing
* Amenities & carousel blocks
* Booking flow with unique booking IDs
* Real-time availability
* Hero sliders, galleries & feature sections
* Staff management
* Fully editable pages using Payload blocks

The best part is how clean and flexible Payload’s structure is. Once I understood collections, blocks, and relationships, it really opened up my workflow. Payload made the process feel structured, scalable, and enjoyable.  

I’ve built many websites, but this one feels special because it pushed me to learn more about Payload’s power and I’m proud of how functional the entire system is now.

I’d love to share more details or get feedback from the community. If anyone is working on a similar project or needs help with hotel/booking features in Payload, I’m happy to talk!

Payload is seriously becoming one of my favorite tools. ❤️

Hey everyone!
Tomorrow is a big day — I’m flying to Thailand with two of my close friends, but the crazy part?

We’re all coming from different places.
One is flying all the way from Ireland, another from Bangalore, and I’ll be joining them directly there.
Three different airports → one country → one adventure.
Feels special already. 

Here’s our 11-day plan:

Itinerary
	•	Day 1: Bangkok
	•	Day 2: Fly to Chiang Mai (night arrival)
	•	Day 3–4: Chiang Mai
	•	Day 5–6: Pai
	•	Day 7: Chiang Mai → Surat Thani
	•	Day 8–9: Koh Phangan
	•	Day 10: Phuket
	•	Day 11: Fly back home

We wanted a trip that feels alive — markets and temples, mountains and roads, island vibes, late nights, early sunrises, good conversations, good food and a lot of memories.

Now we just need your wisdom:

Quick recs we’d love to hear:
	•	One unmissable experience in Bangkok (we only have a day!)
	•	Chiang Mai + Pai highlights — elephants, waterfalls, coffee spots, anything beautiful
	•	Chill beaches + yoga/party balance in Koh Phangan
	•	Best sunset moments or mini-trips from Phuket

If you’ve done something that made you feel connected — to the place, the people, or to yourself — tell us.
That’s the kind of experience we’re chasing..♥️

After an exhaustive search, the only thing that I found is the Ratio 8, but I really can't justify spending $650-800, especially since the company doesn't seem to stand by their products when things go wrong. After ruling out French presses, moka pots, and percolators for various reasons, I've accepted that we will need to do pour-over. The problem is that my husband and I are both barely functioning* before we've had our morning coffee, we're extremely busy and have limited time to spend making coffee, and we drink a LOT of coffee throughout the day. So I need a device/method that I can easily do before my brain is awake and *ideally* one that can make at least 40 oz at once. (Between the two of us, we drink at least 60 oz on a normal day, but I feel like even 40 oz is probably a tall order.) If it's relevant at all, my husband and I don't like strong fruity flavors in our coffee. We tend to go for medium to medium-dark roasts with nutty and/or chocolatey flavors. However, ease of use, consistent results, and high capacity are definitely priorities over everything else for us. For us, coffee is not a hobby; it's part of our daily routine, like brushing our teeth, and we need it to be reliable. I wish I had time to spend on dialing in the perfect method, but with two small children, that's not my current season in life. If someone can tell me what to get and exactly what to do every time, I'm happy to spend the time to do it everyday. 

In addition to avoiding plastic, we would also like to avoid ceramic and any glass with painted markings or tint. (Untinted and unpainted glass is fine, as is stainless steel.)

Edited to add: we have a scale and a Baratza Virtuoso grinder that we like. We don't currently have a kettle, so recommendations are welcome.

1p90s4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/thethyroidwellness/comments/1p90s4p/how_to_reduce_thyroid_in_7_days/,How to reduce thyroid in 7 days?,"Is it really possible to reduce thyroid in 7 days? To this, the answer is yes: thyroid levels can be reduced to an optimal level within a week, but full recovery takes much longer. You will surely notice a drop in your thyroid levels if you stick to a triangular combination of thyroid medications, a strict diet plan, and thyroid-suppressing physical activity. In a week, thyroid reducing symptoms may not be explicitly noticeable. Still, minor changes are indicative of a downsized thyroid, such as slight weight loss, hair loss, or a better sleep schedule. 

# Occurrence of thyroid disorders

Thyroid conditions are a public health issue in the USA with approximately 20 million people being diagnosed in the USA and 1 in every 8 women. There are two types of thyroid disorders: hypothyroidism (low level of thyroid production) and hyperthyroidism (high level of thyroid production). The dysfunctional metabolism, the autoimmune disorders of Hashimoto, the lack of iodine, and the genetic issues are also causes of hypothyroidism. Whereas, hyperthyroidism is rooted in Graves' autoimmune disease, abnormal growth of thyroid lumps, and excessive iodine levels. Despite all this, one can experience both kinds of disorders if they are suffering from thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. If you notice sudden changes in your weight loss, digestion, hair loss, or sleep, consult Dr. Gupta. His constant dedication to helping treat thyroid conditions has achieved a milestone. Under his medical supervision, you can indeed experience minor changes in your thyroid level.

# 7 day thyroid downsizing strategy 

Although 1 week is too early to notice a drop in thyroid levels, it is not impossible to achieve, as maintaining the following systematic approach can yield the desired results. 

# On-time medications and supplements

Timely medications and supplements are the primary solution for your 1-week targeted plan for reduced thyroid. You need to take both thyroid medication and supplements regularly at the same time: the medication on an empty stomach, and the supplements after 1 hour of a meal. It is usually medically advised not to consume any food or beverages within approximately 1 hour of thyroid medication.

Doctors typically prescribe taking thyroid hormone in the morning empty stomach. Decked out with too many timetables? Update your calendar for a daily on-time reminder so you do not miss any instructions. No beverage is allowed to be consumed with thyroid medications and supplements, as it can have adverse effects. Best to have it with water and wait an hour before drinking or eating or as mentioned in your diet. It is highly advised not to prepare thyroid reduction plans on your own, as it may provoke severe conditions that require additional medical attention. Therefore, for a well-rounded functional medicine approach, consult Dr Gupta. Follow his plan strictly, from medications, diet plan, to stress management, to minimize your thyroid level within a week. 

# Dietary restrictions 

To visualize a significant reduction in thyroid levels in 7 days, it is necessary to strictly avoid some foods and drinks. The nature of thyroid disorder you have been diagnosed with determines your dietary restriction. In the case of hyperthyroidism then you must avoid high levels of iodine content because this may result in making your thyroid gland work harder by producing more thyroid hormone. Thus, avoid iodine salt, shellfish, iodine supplements, food products that have been dyed with red color, egg yolk or baked items. 

One should also avoid soy products: milk, sauce, beans, oil, and tofu. Given a second place, caffeine, or daily coffee, chocolate, soft drinks, or black tea is strictly forbidden. Staying away from processed foods that raise inflammation and trigger autoimmune diseases, gluten-containing foodstuffs, and cruciferous foods such as cabbage, soy, sprouts, and millet must be fully avoided by you in case of hypothyroidism. 

# Thyroid boosting nourishment

Your thyroid-boosting nourishment begins with medications and the removal of strictly prohibited foods and beverages from your diet. When you are patient with hyperthyroidism, you must eat low-iodine foods like low-iodized egg whites, vegetable oil, fresh vegetables, lemon water, and fruit juices, and moderate protein foods. Leafy and green vegetables such as sprouts, cauliflower and broccoli should also be included in your diet. 

You should also take foods rich in selenium, such as nuts, baked beans and oatmeal. Foods that contain iron are also advocated, such as sardine fish. Iodine in foods is also too high, i.e., beef products or oysters, which are best avoided at least during the 1st week; you may eat them in moderation, 50 mcg/day, after that. 

In the case of hypothyroidism, you need to consume various fruits in a day (Apples, Grapes, Berries, Pineapple, Bananas, etc) and include plant-based milk in your diet.. Include several detoxifying spices and herbs including turmeric, ginger, lemon, and mustard which are very effective in both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism management.

# Gut health improvement 

The abovementioned food restrictions and dieting also contribute to the enhancement of gut and liver health. The gut microbe majorly helps in ensuring homeostasis and proper growth of the immune cells. T4 is an inactive hormone which is primarily produced in the thyroid gland and is converted to an active hormone called T3 which assists in the regulation of metabolism, energy and body temperature. Approximately 20 percent conversion of the thyroid hormone is carried out in the gut, whereby T4 is converted to T3 by the enzyme sulfatase through bacterial systems. The regulation of iodine intake has already been stated; to maintain a healthy gut, you need to take a regular dose of about 100 mcg of iodine supplementation, which may vary during pregnancy. Low thyroid hormone levels can also occur due to prolonged use of ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, birth control pills, and continuous use of antibiotics, as well as high-sugar and low-fiber foods, which can lead to leaky gut. For noticeable gut improvement within 7 days you need to consume digestive enzymes either through food products or medications.Betaine HCI is necessary in the event that your gut has hypochlorhydria (i.e., has a low concentration of stomach acid), and thus, this impacts the thyroid balance.

# Incorporating physical activity 

Along with it, a severe diet and physical exercise are obligatory components to lower thyroid levels in seven days. Weight gain is normal in hypothyroidism where the level of thyroid hormones is low; therefore, daily exercise can help control thyroid function by keeping weight healthy. Bike riding, climbing, jumping, jogging and walking are strongly recommended for both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Stretching is a simple and frequent exercise, which facilitates the mobility of the joints because individuals with hypothyroidism tend to have too much joint pain or stiffness. Overall, low impact exercises are viable in decreasing thyroid levels. Indeed, assume that you are on a one-week specific plan. Then, you must aim at high intensity aerobic exercises, e.g., swimming aerobics, deep water running and racing laps in the pool. There are several asanas of yoga that are demonstrated to lower thyroid levels. To achieve success, you need to have 30 minutes of yoga asanas and exercises twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

# Stress management techniques 

Thyroid dysfunction due to prolonged stress is a common factor observed among individuals. Both physical and mental stress trigger thyroid issues, leading to various uncontrollable thyroid conditions. If you are suffering from a prolonged infection, continuous work pressure, sudden heart attack, or childbirth, diabetes, you have a high chance of thyroiditis and postpartum thyroidism (only after childbirth). 

Alongside daily physical activities, diet regulations, and medications, 30 minutes of meditation is mandatory for stress relief. The yoga asanas recommended as a physical activity also play a greater role in managing your stress and anxiety, leading to better sleep. There are other ways, but they are time-consuming, and for an immediate 7-day result, too much activity can backfire on your plan.

# Conclusion 

For one week, follow the above instructions including avoiding and incorporating food and beverages, physical activities, stress management techniques, and improving your gut strictly, without minor changes or skipping. Even after following these strict plans, if you do not notice noticeable changes in your body, you need to wait a bit longer. Everyone functions differently based on their individual biological clock. ",1,1764351132.0,thethyroidwellness,0,1.0,False
1p90s49,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomadlife/comments/1p90s49/kaohsiung_harbor_city_with_a_tropical_soul_for/,🌴 Kaohsiung — Harbor City with a Tropical Soul for Digital Nomads,"Whenever people talk about Taiwan for digital nomads, it’s usually all about **Taipei** (big city energy) or **Taichung** (creative mid-point). But down south, **Kaohsiung** quietly exists as this warm, open, harbor city with big skies, ocean vibes, and a slower, tropical rhythm.

If you’ve ever thought:

* “I want **Taiwan**, but with more **sun, sea, and space**” 🌊
* “I like **big cities**, but I’m done with being squeezed into tiny apartments” 🏙➡️🏖
* “I want an **underrated base** with decent infrastructure and chill energy”

…then **Kaohsiung** might be exactly your kind of place.

Here’s a breakdown for digital nomads considering Kaohsiung 👇

https://preview.redd.it/xqcbs2vp914g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4a1ae9f57456ab95a2cd299359ea20cba9d8fe

# 🌞 1. Weather & Atmosphere: Southern, Sunny, Open

Kaohsiung feels very different from northern Taiwan.

* **More sunshine** than Taipei
* **Warmer climate** (it’s the south – expect tropical vibes)
* Big open boulevards, wide streets, and a lot of **sky**
* Harbor, riverside, and coastal walks instead of just concrete

If Taichung is “mild and comfy,” Kaohsiung is “warm and breezy.”  
Yes, summers can be hot, but if you like tropical weather and being close to the sea, this is a big plus.

# 💸 2. Cost of Living: Good Value For a Big City

Kaohsiung is a **major city** that still feels very affordable compared to many Asian hubs.

Rough monthly budget for a solo nomad (USD):

* 🏠 **Rent (studio / 1BR):** \~ **$400–$750**
* 🍜 **Food (local food + cafés):** **$230–$380**
* 🚇 **Transport (MRT, buses, some Uber):** **$25–$45**
* 💻 **Coworking / café budget:** **$70–$140**

You can live comfortably around **$1,000–$1,600 / month**, depending on neighborhood and lifestyle.

The huge bonus:  
You’re in a **coastal city with MRT**, not some random village.

# ☕ 3. Cafés & Coworking: A Growing Scene

Kaohsiung doesn’t have Taipei’s sheer volume of coworking spaces, but for many nomads the combo of **cafés + a few solid coworking options** is completely enough.

# ☕ Cafés

You’ll find:

* A mix of **minimalist and cozy cafés** with Wi-Fi
* Plenty of spots where working on a laptop is totally normal
* Brunch places with decent coffee and stable internet
* Harbor- or river-adjacent cafés for more “scenic workdays”

It’s not Chiang Mai levels of laptop cafés, but you won’t be struggling to find places to work.

# 💻 Coworking

Coworking-wise, expect:

* A handful of modern spaces in central areas
* Places focused on freelancers, startups, and small teams
* Decent Wi-Fi speeds + meeting spaces
* More relaxed energy than heavy corporate hubs

If your ideal balance is **2–3 coworking days + the rest in cafés / at home**, Kaohsiung works.

# 📍 4. Best Areas to Stay for Digital Nomads

# 🟦 1. Gushan / Pier-2 Art Center area

* Near the harbor and the famous **Pier-2 Art Center**
* Street art, creative spaces, indie shops
* Easy access to seaside promenades and ferries
* Great if you like an **artsy + industrial vibe**

# 🟥 2. Yancheng District

* Close to both the harbor and city landmarks
* Lots of food options and some older architecture
* Walkable, character-rich, slightly vintage feel
* Good if you want **history + harbor** in one place

# 🟩 3. Central / Formosa Boulevard MRT area

* Super central, good for exploring the whole city
* Iconic **Dome of Light** station
* Easier to reach other neighborhoods via MRT
* Solid choice if you want to be well-connected

# 🟨 4. Zuoying (near HSR station)

* Convenient if you travel a lot by high-speed rail
* Fast access to Taipei, Taichung, Tainan
* More local, residential feel
* Good for long stays if you travel often

# 🚇 5. Transport & Getting Around

This is where Kaohsiung pleasantly surprises people.

* **MRT system** (red + orange lines) covers a lot of key areas
* **Light rail (LRT)** running near the waterfront and Pier-2
* Buses, taxis, and Uber are widely available
* You can also bike along some riverside and coastal paths

Compared to Taichung’s “bus-heavy, no metro” setup, Kaohsiung feels more like a **proper urban grid**, just with palm trees and ocean air.

# 🧠 6. City Vibe: Harbor City With a Tropical Soul

Kaohsiung has a very specific personality:

* It feels **wide, open, and less cramped**
* There’s a mix of **industrial harbor**, **old neighborhoods**, and **modern malls**
* Creative pockets like **Pier-2 Art Center** tie it all together

This is the kind of place where your day might look like:

>

It doesn’t scream “startup capital” — it leans more into **“liveable coastal city that secretly has everything you need.”**

# 🏝 7. Lifestyle & Things To Do

# 🏖 Waterfront & islands

* Stroll along the **Love River**
* Explore the **harborfront** and art installations
* Take a short ferry ride to **Cijin Island**
   * Chill beach
   * Seafood
   * Lighthouse and coastal views

Great for **day-off vibes** or a low-key weekend.

# 🌙 Night markets & food

Kaohsiung comes with the usual Taiwan food perks:

* Night markets with noodles, skewers, seafood, and snacks
* Local breakfast shops (soy milk, egg pancakes, rice rolls)
* Plenty of Taiwanese staples + some international options

Compared to Taipei, it’s a bit less overloaded with trends, more **local-everyday** and relaxed.

# 🧳 8. Pros & Cons for Digital Nomads

# ✅ Pros

* 🌞 More sun and warmth than Taipei
* 🌊 Harbor, riverside, and coastal access
* 💸 Lower cost of living than many big Asian cities
* 🚇 MRT + LRT make it easier to move around
* 🎨 Pier-2 area and local creative spots
* Less hustle, more space

# ❌ Cons

* 💻 Smaller coworking scene than Taipei
* 🌍 Smaller international/nomad community
* ☔ Summers can be hot and humid
* 🛫 Fewer direct international flights than Taipei (depending on route)

If you need huge meetups, endless coworking options, and constant events, Kaohsiung may feel “too quiet.”  
If you want **tropical-city energy without chaos**, it might be perfect.

# 🛂 9. What About Visas?

Like the rest of Taiwan:

* There’s **no dedicated digital nomad visa** (yet)
* Many people stay on **visa-free entries, visitor visas, or working holiday visas** (depending on nationality)

Always check **official Taiwan immigration websites** for up-to-date info, since rules can shift.

# TL;DR

>

Choose **Kaohsiung** if you want:

* A **warmer**, more laid-back base
* Access to **harbor, river, and beach life**
* A city that feels big but not overwhelming
* A more affordable alternative to Taipei

It’s not yet a “classic” digital nomad hotspot, and that’s exactly why some people end up loving it. 🌴",1,1764351131.0,digitalnomadlife,0,1.0,False

It's true; it's something I tell my dinner guests when they have the capacity to visit, though this prompts them to collect their children away from the backyard beneath which is buried a dead man and scurry off into the night, not a foot ever set back onto my property. I once had a child come back to my property after he had grown, and he asked why his parents had collected him so hastily and prevented him from ever coming back to see me again. I told him what I already told you, and what I am about to tell you: there is a dead painter in my backyard, and you had trapsed upon his grave, and the painter never wanted anyone to do that because he had made his grave and gravestone himself, molded from his paints and paint brushes into a large spire protruding from the dirt before which he dug a large hole, then laid himself down in the hole and did himself in and away. That weekend there was a torrential storm, and the elements blanketed the painter with the dirt he had scrounge to the side of his grave. The painter had been dead four days by that time, time which conditioned his body to be a loose assortment of rotting skin that liquefied when the rain struck it; by the time the dirt covered his whole body, only his legs, covered in brown pants, had not been torn of its skin and turned into a skeleton. No one knew of the painter's corpse in his -- my -- backyard except his mother, who had seen him dead in the hole and consequently lost every fiber of her sanity, never bringing herself to go back outside and bury her baby boy properly. She let God and Mother Nature do that for her. When time came around to pass the house on, I bought it for myself and fathered five children within with five different women, none of whom stuck around much long after I told them, ""Honey, we've got a dead painter in our backyard."" I haven't seen the children they took with them to wherever they chose to go -- haven't seen them in up to twenty-two years.

I never went outside to unbury the slight mound in my backyard, take steel to the little rise that takes form in my backyard as if my backyard sprouted a low pimple. It is not enough of a mound to bother flattening it, though I do trip and fall over it as I see more time pass and kill me, and I don't not believe the story enough to pay some poor fool to dig up the spot and find an even poorer fool's remains; at this point, I'd rather let nature run its course and wash away the painter into the anals of time. I myself cannot do anything without having someone else do it, and I am not demented enough to simply let someone stumble upon the painter in all of his sheer glory, all for a glass or two of lemonade and a low wage. Besides, I like sitting in my dining room, whose walls are made of glass, and staring out upon the spire sticking out in the dirt, something not inconspicuous enough that I would take it down or pay someone to take it down, yet conspicuous enough so as to contrast with the tree-line at the edge of which it finds itself nestled, proving to be a startle to my morning routine that puts more caffeine in my veins than humble coffee. If there is a dead man beneath the spire, then I like what he has made for me; I like that he has made for me this, has made for me something that brings me to this. When I go, I'd like to be buried on the other side of that spire, away from the sun, behind the tree-line; God will not be able to see me there and the five wedding bands he has molded for me, yet he can stare upon his poor painter, and can take my place in being pleasantly startled at seeing the spire in the tree-line like a panther, and being admired at the fact that its creator and its first and dearest admirer lie beneath its feet.",2,1764351092.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

He was in my city (let’s call it Narnia) for a master’s program. I knew it probably wouldn’t turn into anything long-term since he was younger, moving around for school, and figuring out his next steps and were in different places, but we genuinely enjoyed each other, had a lot in common, plus heaps of connection and chemistry.

We stayed in touch after he left, and I even visited him once. Nothing dramatic ended it, but it faded in a sort of sad and bitter way (as I suspected would happen, bc of the aforementioned).

We both moved on, got new partners, and only saw each other’s lives through occasional glimpses on social media.

Three years later, completely out of nowhere, we ran into each other in a supermarket back in Narnia (where I was still living). He had moved back for work that very weekend, and I was actually leaving Narnia that very same weekend for a new job in a new city. It was such an unexpected encounter - we exchanged a quick hello/update, then moved on.

Since then, I’ve broken up with my ex (and still live in the new town I’d moved away to).

About three weeks ago, I got a totally out of the blue message from him asking me how I am, saying he thinks about me all the time, never forgot me, and always wondered “what if.” (The supermarket meet up was 2 years ago, btw - and now we are 33 and 30).

I don’t live in Narnia anymore, but on the exact day he messaged me, I happened to en route back there for a week long work trip. I debated replying, but eventually did and asked if he wanted to get coffee.

We met up and ended up talking for hours. The connection came back instantly.

Here’s the catch: he’s still with his girlfriend. He says they’re in a dead, loveless relationship, in the throes of breaking up, but it’s messy because they live together and are stuck in a lease. I’ve been in that situation before so I get how slow and complicated the end stage can be.

I told him I’m not going to cheat or entertain anything romantic until he’s fully out of that relationship. He said understands completely.

I know I need to be careful. But the spark is still very real, and we have so much in common.

I’m not even sure what kind of advice I’m looking for. Just wondering if anyone else has been in a situation like this, where someone from your past reappears (and it’s kinda messy?).",1,1764351086.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I don’t eat out and when I go to other people’s houses I decline drinks unless it’s bottled or in cans. My boyfriends parents let their dogs lick out of cups and dishes once they’ve finished their food or coffee, I don’t care what other people do in their homes but I, for obvious reasons, do not want that happening in my home with my dog. They were asking about visiting my house (I am pregnant, boyfriend doesn’t live with me as he works away). I’m in the UK and it’s very common to ask guests if they want a cup of tea. I have my own “special” mugs and stuff that no one else is allowed to use and pretty sets for guests. I have a little dog who I adore with my whole heart, he has been a massive grounding tool for me, I don’t want anyone to think I don’t like dogs or don’t love him because I don’t want him to lick my dishes lol. He is my world, he sleeps with me (he gets regular grooms and oral cleaning, makes me feel like he’s a clean boy). I mentioned to my boyfriend that if his parents tried to let my dog lick from their mugs that he asks them not to because it will upset me, I would have to bin the mugs and I just think it isn’t very healthy for a dog to be drinking tea/coffee. He acted like I was being cruel and calling them dirty but I feel like it’s very understandable for anyone to not want this. I have struggled a lot more since being pregnant, I wasn’t rude about it nor did I say they were dirty just that I’d rather this not happen with my things. What they do in their own home is their choice but I don’t feel like I’m wrong for asking it to not happen in my home. AIO? 
ETA: My boyfriend doesn’t let him lick from his plates or anything. He doesn’t let their dogs when he’s there either because he thinks it’s gross. So I don’t understand why it’s an issue for me to ask him that he politely tells them no if they try with my dog. I am okay telling them not to but I felt like it would be better if he did it as they are his parents ",16,1764350984.0,AmIOverreacting,31,0.83,False

I’m a first-time writer sharing my story, and I’d love your honest feedback. It’s set in Nairobi and follows a young woman’s unexpected encounter at her favorite café. I’m hoping to see if the opening grabs your attention.

Here’s the beginning:


---

Aisha pushed open the door of her favorite café on Ngong Road. The warm aroma of freshly brewed coffee and pastries wrapped around her like an old friend. Outside, the usual honking of matatus and chatter of street vendors reminded her that Nairobi never truly slept. She loved this little escape—a quiet corner, her notebook, and a steaming cup of cappuccino.

Did the opening draw you in?

Do the characters feel interesting?

Any suggestions for improvement?

1p90nzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/thethyroidwellness/comments/1p90nzi/5_detox_drinks_to_boost_thyroid_functioning/,5 Detox Drinks To Boost Thyroid Functioning,"Regulating gut health and managing a proportionate weight are two of the most common parameters people are trying to incorporate into their lifestyle. Morning black tea and coffee are getting replaced by detox drinks. Despite all this, if you are diagnosed with thyroid conditions, then body detoxification is a mandatory activity that should top your lifestyle measuring lists. Adding leafy vegetables, anti-inflammatory and thyroid-regulating fruits and spices will help to cleanse your body. 

This article discusses 5 detox drinks rich in inflammatory substances, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that are well-liked for their extraordinary ability to improve thyroid health. However, as a precautionary approach is always appreciated over post-disorder treatment, it is advisable to seek a doctor. 

# What is the association between body detoxification and thyroid functioning? 

Body detoxification and thyroid functioning are linked in a very complicated and multifunctional process that requires the functioning of the liver, the health of the gut, and the environment. The human body also possesses an automatic system of detoxification, yet when it is exposed to toxins for long, this can be detrimental. Dr Gupta focused on how these systems of thyroid healing and body detoxification relate to each other. Removing toxins in our bodies may be helpful in enhancing the liver and gut health, which is essential in thyroid health. According to his functional medicine perspective, a rearrangement of a diet that contains healthy foods and purifying beverages can be used to treat thyroid disorders. 

# Toxin buildup and thyroid stress

The high vascularisation of heavy metals (Lead, Cadmium, and others) is becoming a cause of thyroid vulnerability. Although thyroid non-cancerous disorders have a low mortality rate, the morbidity of these conditions affects their overall well-being. The accidental consumption of essential trace elements layered up with toxic metals is increasing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism among people.

# Hormonal balance with detoxification 

Toxins in our bodies act as endocrine disruptors that require immediate elimination. These disruptors cause thyroid and gut inflammation and affect hormonal balance. Anti-inflammatory properties, thyroid-active agents, and hormone regulators are common in detox drinks. If you book an appointment with Dr. Gupta, you will get a thorough understanding of the various mineral requirements based on your deficiencies and balanced levels.

# 5 Thyroid-revitalizing healthy drinks

The healthy drinks to rejuvenate your thyroid system should have fresh vegetables and fruits which are full of zinc, selenium, iodine and antioxidants. However, you should consult a doctor, because too much of these minerals may have side effects on thyroid functioning. You have to seek an appointment with Dr. Gupta to understand what the best thing to do is and how to turn around your thyroid condition. His functional medicine system looks at the underlying cause of thyroid dysfunction and depending on the result, he proposes good lifestyle interventions.

# Lemon-Turmeric-Ginger Tea 

Due to its superior qualities, the tea is very helpful in detoxifying the thyroid. Lemon and ginger contain vitamin C and antioxidants that aid in reducing toxicity in the body, enhancing liver functionality, and improving the general health of the thyroid. Ginger is relaxing and helps with digestion. One can add a pinch of turmeric to the drink to make it more effective, as it is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that helps the thyroid. It has been found out that individuals diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease have realized positive impacts once they began to take turmeric on a regular basis. This lemon-ginger and turmeric beverage is a blend of drinks that enhances metabolic rate, liver and thyroid functions. It also ensures your hormonal balance and in case you take it on an empty stomach in the morning. 

# Lettuce-Parsley-Cilantro drink 

The multidimensional effect of herbs on thyroid functions is that they clean up the body. This Lettuce-Parsley-Cilantro juice is among such beverages. It is a low-calorie green juice that may be very helpful in leafy vegetables to boost metabolism in the body and make the thyroid stable. Though good exercise stimulates your physical health, it also aids in the detoxification of the liver and the proper digestive process. Iron is a vital mineral needed for proper functioning of the thyroid, and lettuce provides it in sufficient amounts. The antioxidant effects aid in the prevention of too much oxidative stress in the body and cellular redox homeostasis. As the toxicity of the body increases it influences thyroid functioning and demands detoxifying agents. Lifestyle changes are best suited with a medicinal approach. These amendments are taking detox drinks in your food and they give a cumulative effect of vitamins A, C, and K which help in thyroid functioning and well being in general.

# Beetroot-Lemon-Ginger-Carrot Juice

Vegetables such as Beetroot and Carrot are detoxifying vegetables that aid in modifying physical toxicity. Beetroot contains high amounts of antioxidants, and this aids the liver in helping it get rid of harmful chemicals. Carrots are good in vitamin A, antioxidants, and betaine. Each one of them is efficient in thyroid health care. Carrots particularly aid in thyroid activity which greatly helps those who are hypothyroid (lack of thyroid hormones) as opposed to those who are said to have hyperthyroidism (excess hormone production). Lemon and ginger are very common ingredients in most of the detox drinks aimed at the health of the thyroid. Thus, by introducing these two components to the beetroot and carrot juices, it improves the detoxification abilities and is also multi-purpose since it can be used as a weight loss, better digestive, and less inflammatory agent. The drink interrupts a series of successive thyroid functions degradation and provides proper hormonal turnover (T4 to T3).

# Cucumber Water 

The cucumber is a naturally hydrating vegetable that, in itself, offers some anti-inflammatory benefits, which increase the level of hydration in your system due to a variety of factors. Cucumber helps in thyroid functioning by balancing the immune system and keeping cholesterol low. One has noted that conditions of the immune system which result in autoimmune thyroid disorders. Cucumber also has other minerals like Silica, Potassium and Magnesium, which all help in the support of thyroid functioning. Magnesium also has a direct relationship with the production of thyroid hormones and their conversion. It is also very efficient in assisting people to cope with the autoimmune disease known as Hashimoto's. Thyroid levels and thyroid activities are maintained when the body is exposed to a sufficient amount of silica. 

# Cinnamon Juice, Lemon-Apple Cider Vinegar

The aim of Apple cider vinegar, lemon and cinnamon are the same, i.e., to maintain healthy thyroid operation and health at large. Apple cider vinegar is regarded as one of the best sources for weight loss. The thyroid health of consuming apple cider vinegar in the morning on an empty stomach with lemon and Lukewarm water helps nourish your gut, liver and stomach. Another weight reduction is an intervention to aid thyroid regulation, and this beverage assists in it. The cider assists in sustaining acid levels, digestion, and general thyroid functioning. Cinnamon can be used to regulate hormone levels and treat hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. It also facilitates the immune system and prevents dysfunctional immune conditions.

# Conclusion 

The reason why regular detox drinks are included does not imply that you do not have to make other lifestyle changes, like changes in food habits and lack of physical activity. In fact, all these 5 beverages are good in enhancing thyroid health. Nevertheless, some of the things that can be recommended not to be excessively demanding on your body are the consumption of all five beverages 5 times a day. There are several other minerals, vitamins, and detoxifying nutrients which may interact with only each other of which you are not aware. So, it's better to be safe and have one or a maximum of two drinks to avoid any complications. Further, you need a medical intervention before you start drinking these daily, as too much consumption can affect your thyroid function. ",1,1764350861.0,thethyroidwellness,0,1.0,False

* Wilfa Svart Aroma Precision.
* Digi scales.
* V60.
* Good beans.
* Standard kettle that just boils water.

**Use case:**

* We drink a lot of tea, often tea that needs brewing as low as 70C (158F) so having a temperature controlled kettle will be an upgrade not just to coffee for tea also.
* A larger kettle volume. For tea we drink out of 350ml mugs, so the standard 600ml gooseneck kettle size is too small.
* I'm looking at the Stagg EKG Pro OR Stagg Corvo, primarily because these are both temperature controlled but also one of the few that are 900ml not 600ml. 

**Problems:**

* The issue I've got is gooseneck kettles suck for tea. If I've got a big 350ml cup and a flow rate of 6-7s/100ml and I'm making two cups, I'm there for almost 50s pouring water. 
* Faster flow rate gooseneck kettles exist, but they're all 600ml volume.

**Potential solutions**

* Hario Air
* Hario Drop Assist

Husband is tooling around in the garage (drinking beer).

Couple hours later switch to red wine, down a couple of glasses quickly settle back into chair with a large glass.

Pizza arrives a couple hours later eat a few slices pour more wine settle back into chair now it's 7 and I feel like garbage, heavy, sluggish, crabby, impatient, tired.  Nod off here and there restart my Netflix a hundred times.  

By now husband has retired to the bedroom to watch sports.  I finally get out of my chair get PJs on and get a glass of Vodka from downstairs and hide it under the coffee table nipping it for the next little while.  Still have a glass of warm gross red wine.  I remember there's pizza leftover so I heat THREE more slices up and devour them.  Finally head to the guest room to bed because I want to drink more vodka and scroll my phone.  Fall asleep (pass out) wake up at 4 am feeling bloated, anxious, guilty, sad and confused.  Think for awhile then reach over and DRINK SOME VODKA to quiet it all.  It works great.  Fall back asleep until around 8.  Wake up and because I feel so bad I do the exact.same.thing that day.

1p90gei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1p90gei/i_desperately_needed_a_break_from_my_kids_so_i/,I desperately needed a break from my kids so I just left the house,"I told my husband and screaming toddler I’ll be back in a few minutes. It’s been too much. His parents have been at our house for half or the whole weekend for months so I haven’t had an actual break in months. Last weekend we traveled 2 hours to the zoo, spent the rest of the day at their apartment. Yesterday they came to us last minute for Thanksgiving and showed up at 10am so I didn’t even get time for myself or with just my kids. We’re supposed to go to their apartment again tomorrow so it’ll be a 9am-9/10pm day centered around them again. 

Last night the baby and toddler were both up multiple times and needed soothing. This morning first thing my toddler threw an hour long tantrum. He woke up my baby from his nap so we didn’t get a break there either. I took baby for a walk but felt super jittery bc I hadn’t eaten anything yet. My husband had the stroller in his car so I had to use the backup which was wet so when I brought baby in we had to do a full change down to the diaper. I looked outside and see the leftover turkey sitting outside so all the leftovers are wasted. That’s how my husband ‘put it away’. We are beekeepers and he had a big pot of honey waiting to be bottled and he left it uncovered and there was a dead mouse in it. I felt sick to my stomach over the mouse murder and this wasted honey. 

I told my husband I needed a break at 1030am. For 1.5 hours I tried getting away from everyone but my toddler was literally screaming banging on my door. At first my husband tried to calm him down and get him to stop but eventually he gave up and started making coffee from whole beans and a french press, like the longest way. Finally I couldn’t take it and went into the living room, now reinforcing my toddlers screaming and banging. I sat on the couch and started panicking because I’m desperate for a break. My toddler was screaming crying and my baby was crawling up my leg and my husband was STILL making the coffee, whistling, while I was silently crying. I finally get up and say if one more person touches me I’m going to scream. I got my coat and keys and said I’m going out for a few minutes, I’ll be back in a few minutes.

hey folks, figured i'd share some parking tips for the pledge for a prosperous palestine benefit show on 11/30 at will's pub. honestly, parking in the mills 50 district is always a huge headache, especially for a friday night show starting at 7:00 pm. the main roads get absolutely slammed.  
  
the best secret is always Prked. this is an app where you can rent driveways and private garages, and there are almost always a few spots available from residents on the side streets right next to will's pub. it's usually way cheaper than paying for a lot downtown, you get to skip the main drag traffic, and it's a super short walk. check that first, it's a game changer for this area.  
  
failing that, will's pub does have its own small lot, but it fills up instantly, like maybe the first 10 cars who get there. if you do manage to snag a spot in the pub's lot or a nearby private lot, make sure you look for any signs that tell you to register your car inside the venue or at a kiosk. apparently people have been getting tickets for not doing this even in designated lots, so read everything carefully.  
  
your main option will be street parking on the side roads between canton street and oregon street. there is free street parking available in the neighborhood. since the show starts at 7:00 pm, any city metered spots should be free after 6 p.m., which is a huge plus.  
  
the key strategy is to cruise the residential side streets, but you absolutely have to watch out for yellow curbs and ""no parking"" signs. you can sometimes find a decent spot across the street behind businesses like the j bauman salon, as that lot is often considered fair game at night. the further north you go toward colonial drive, the harder it gets, but the lot shared by lineage coffee and lazy moon pizza is a known, walkable option if you are totally stuck, though technically it's for their patrons.  
  
honestly, just plan to get there early, maybe by 6:30 pm at the latest, because the street spots get really full for night shows. if you show up right at 7, you'll be driving around for a while.  
  
hope this helps everyone get in smooth and enjoy the concert.",1,1764350253.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Barcelona vs. Alavés: A LaLiga Lopsided Love Story (With Fewer Goals Than a Bar Exam)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that’s as lopsided as a poorly timed dad joke: **FC Barcelona** hosts **Deportivo Alavés** in a LaLiga clash that’s basically a math problem with a soccer ball. Let’s break it down with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why Barcelona’s Win Probability is Higher Than My Hope for a Quiet Weekend

Let’s start with the cold, hard stats. Barcelona sits second in LaLiga with 31 points, just one behind Real Madrid. Alavés? They’re 14th with 15 points—four goals above the relegation zone, but about as threatening as a vegan tiger. In their last five games, Alavés has mustered one win, one draw, and three losses. For context, that’s the offensive output of a team that plays soccer by email: “Sorry, we’re still drafting this goal. Let’s reschedule.”

Barcelona’s recent form is… well, it’s “peak Barcelona.” They just thumped Celta Vigo 4-0 but also got spanked 3-0 by Chelsea in the Champions League. Still, their attack is as reliable as a microwave (sometimes you get hot, sometimes you get sad steam). Robert Lewandowski, the Polish goal machine, scored the only goal in their last meeting against Alavés in February 2025. If he’s feeling nostalgic, maybe he’ll gift Alavés another 1-0 script.

Injuries? Barcelona’s version of a “light workout.” Goalkeeper Ter Stegen and midfielder Gavi are out, but Pedri might return after recovering from injury. Alavés, meanwhile, has a full squad—though “full” here means “not missing anyone who can score a goal.” They’ve failed to score in their last two games, which is like showing up to a buffet and only eating the napkins.

---

### Digest the News: Ter Stegen’s Absence is Like a Party Without Music

Barcelona’s defense, already reliant on luck and Marc-André ter Stegen’s superhero reflexes, now has to wing it without him. Imagine trying to build a sandcastle during a tsunami—this is Alavés’ chance to… *gasp*… *score?* But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Alavés hasn’t scored in two games, so even if they *do* capitalize on Barcelona’s shaky backline, it’ll probably be a 1-0 resul

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

However, as a single woman in her late 20s, I am often served content about dating as it seems to be a common topic for women my age who I may otherwise have similar interests to.  One opinion that seems to be prevalent amongst straight women of all political backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses is that men should be paying for the first date and generally providing more financially in a relationship.  Ultimately, people can choose to require whichever standards they want in a relationship (I know this sub seems to lean trad at times), but I think what bothers me about this take is that it is often framed in a way that it is actually FEMINIST and you are a pick-me if you disagree.  This surprises me because women who I would otherwise consider progressive even agree with this perspective.  If you want a man to pay for your dates/life, fine I guess.  But the constant justification of this choice being the only logical option is what I find ridiculous and every single rationale for this opinion can be so easily debunked.

1. Women spend more time/money getting ready for a date, so it only makes sense that a man should pay. — ….just don’t spend as much time getting ready if you think it is so inefficient and expensive??  As I said, I do not date, but I have no issue going to work/out to dinner with friends/concerts without makeup on.  Usually when I wear makeup, it’s more graphic, high-fashion makeup that I like to do for my creativity that men would hate anyway.  I would imagine I also would have no issue not wearing makeup to a date.  Men also spend time showering, brushing their hair, general hygiene to appear presentable for a date and women can easily just complete the same bare minimum getting ready process.  This, to me, just seems to perpetuate a stereotype that women are required to spend time beautifying themselves for a man’s affection and that is just a relationship that I would never want to be a part of anyways. 

2. Men make more historically than women, so men should pay for dates. — From a macro perspective, yes men as a collective make more than women as a collective.  However, this is not true in individual relationships.  Most of my friends make about the same amount of money as their partners and most people tend to date individuals with a similar socioeconomic status.  

3. If a man is not going to pay, I could just go out with my friends. — But your friends would not be paying for you either??  The amount of money that you would spend going out with a man and paying for your portion versus going out with friends and paying your portion would be the same.  Of course, hanging out with pre-existing friends has a higher guarantee of a fun time as opposed to hanging out with a stranger.  However, with this logic, you would never meet any new friends either because it is always more risky to be awkward hanging out with a stranger.  This reason just screams that you are looking for a “provider” or a “free meal” rather than a legitimate connection.  

4. If a man asked me on a date, then he should pay. — Again, this logic is never followed in any other connection.  If I meet a friend at an activity group/work and they ask me if I want to hang out and get coffee, it is never implied that they are paying for me.  I would also never expect them to pay for me. Ultimately, even if both people have a genuine interest in hanging out, someone has to formally ask.  I just do not see the logic that asking someone out to grab lunch/dinner/do an activity, would lead to the implication that they are paying as this implication never seems to extend to friendship.  The goal is to find, not only a romantic partner, but someone you like on a friend level in dating (at least that’s what I would think) so the fact that the expectations in hetero dating are so different than friendship expectations is so odd to me.  

5.  Women provide more emotional labor and men benefit more from relationships generally, so men should provide the financial component. — Similar to wearing makeup….just don’t provide the emotional labor or only date guys who also are providing a similar amount of emotional labor.  Maybe it’s just the tism but I would never enter into a situation that is inherently disadvantageous to me.  I also am inherently not someone who is particularly tidy or skilled at providing emotional support (again likely tism) so it would be quite unlikely for me to find myself in a situation where I am constantly doing substantially more housework and providing more emotional support than anyone (including a male partner).  I think this is a case of some women just wanting a relationship so desperately that they are willing to settle for a partner that they do not particularly connect with emotionally.  Therefore, they only way to justify the situation to themselves is that a man is providing financially.

7. Women are putting themselves in a risky position anytime they go on a date, so the least he can do is pay.  — If you seriously are putting yourself in danger to go out on a date, you definitely should not be going out.  Obviously there’s a minor risk anytime you meet up with someone you do not know well, but take general safety precautions and, if the situation really seems strange, do not go.  I would never risk my safety just to go out with a stranger and this reason is utterly ridiculous.  

8. If a man was going out with Megan Fox or Tate McRae, he would pay.  — This reason actually makes the most logical sense to me, but it is still kind of sad.  I guess I can understand the ideology of utilizing the willingness to pay for a date as a barometer for interest, but the idea that a man would pay for a woman that he truly likes is still rooted in the patriarchal ideology that women are a prize to be bought and the worthiness of said prize is judged by beauty.  I personally can not subscribe to that ideology, but this is the only reason that I can somewhat understand.

Also, before someone says it, I’m not a guy—just an indifferent girl blogger.  I also think that a lot of men on both sides of the political spectrum believe that men should pay (both Charlie Kirk types and lib guys on tiktok) so I do not even think that’s a valid accusation.  Also, do whatever you want in your relationship, I just genuinely love discourse.  ",4,1764349640.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,28,0.54,False

1p8zvu6,https://i.redd.it/jsrsexkm314g1.png,The story I didn't tell anyone,"It was 2019 when I first saw her, not in real life, but on the explore page of Instagram. It could have been any other photo, but I clicked and then checked her profile, scrolling through her page while not knowing what lay ahead. It was her bio that caught my attention, which said, ""I prefer tea over coffee and inner beauty over looks."" After reading that bio, I slid into her DMs and just wrote a simple ""Hi."" After a week, to my surprise, I got a response from her, and that was the start that led towards the screenshot you are seeing.

She was not from India but from Poland, an inspiring young model who had quite a large following on Instagram because of her striking looks. She was someone who won the genetic lottery; trust me, if you saw her, you'd never forget her. Classic Scandinavian beauty: blonde hair, blue eyes, just unbelievable. Remember the quote I mentioned? She was actually like that—elegant beauty on the outside, but with an even more beautiful personality. Now you are wondering how the hell a guy from India got a response from her on Instagram? Like you, I still wonder and even wish sometimes that she never replied.

I'm just an average-looking guy, nothing special. I still remember all those conversations I had with her, and I still remember her dog's name, which she mentioned just once five years ago. Yeah, my memory is strong. We used to talk for hours sometimes, and we used to exchange 30-40 texts a day on average. Sometimes we even talked or texted for hours, but there was a problem: she was taken even before I started to know her. She was in a long-term relationship, and she was only talking to me as a ""friend."" The fact is, she never told me, and I never asked if she was in a relationship. But I had an idea because she used to run an advertisement company with her boyfriend, and she told me everything about that, not just that she had a boyfriend, but she only introduced that guy to me as her friend or partner in her company.  I never had guts to ask her that is she in a relationship bc I didn't wanted to break my delusion bc I fell for her got attached to her 

It would be not honest if I tell you that I only fell for her personality , yes her striking beauty played a part but I was her personality her famine energy that kind nature that humble behavior and  those talks between us and many more things that are not possible write here , skip to 2020 I was in love yeah i don't know that it was love or not but my day at that time was empty without her I was that attached to her 

After thinking a million times, I decided to let her know my feelings. I literally thought I could get her. I was in a delusion, unaware of my reality, unaware of the distance between us, kaha India kaha Poland 

Now read that screenshot i was shell shocked and she was too or maybe not there were so many instances where i was flirting and she was flirting back , those texts where it was so glaring that I like her i don't think she was that naive to not know that i like her or love her but that was her response in the screenshot And yet, after my confession, she didn't tell me she was in a relationship.

So everything fell apart the friendship between us , those long conversation bc after knowing her feelings for me I started to feel like my simping and i didn't wanted to be just a friend i became toxic , she wanted to me to be her friend,  she was sad when I told her that my feelings for you doesn't allow our friendship and i walked off 💔 

Sorry, the story got long. I still have so many things to say, but maybe next time. Feel free to ask anything about this story. Thank you.",18,1764349071.0,IndianBoysOnTinder,50,0.76,False

Last month this took me the better part of a week, but sure, I’ll “try.” 

It took me over an hour just to download the data. Salesforce made me reset my password, Zuora wanted MFA, NetSuite was loading like it’s on dial-up, and Chase asked me security questions I haven’t thought about since college. By the time all four CSVs were finally on my laptop, I already needed another coffee.

Then came the matching. WTF. Salesforce calls the customer one thing, Zuora something slightly different, so half my VLOOKUPs just errored. I spent the whole morning hopping between tabs, manually checking names, getting pinged on Slack about unrelated issues, and making absolutely no visible progress.

In the afternoon the CFO asked for a preliminary cash collection number for the board deck. I’m still knee deep in discrepancies, but he needs 'something today' so I send an early estimate. Immediately get a “why is this so low?” reply. Yeah great.

The rest of the day was me untangling weird one-off issues: payments coming in under different names, cash sitting unapplied in NetSuite, invoices that look unpaid but actually are… somewhere. I found one clean match for every three messy ones.

hey reno folks, figured i'd share some parking tips for the jingle bell rock show at the eldorado on 11/30. casino parking can be a real headache, especially trying to get out after a show when everyone bails at the same time. it's downtown reno, so expect some mess around 4:00 pm.  
  
first, if you want to skip the casino garage traffic completely, check out Prked. honestly, this is the insider way to do it. it’s an app where people rent out their driveways or private spots right next to the casino. way cheaper than valet, and you can usually find a spot a block or two away that lets you bypass all the main virginia street congestion . you'll just walk a couple extra minutes, but the exit is seamless.  
  
now, for the main options:  
  
the eldorado parking garage (at 345 n virginia st) is the easiest bet, and the best news is that self-parking is free for all patrons, even if you aren't staying at the hotel . they do say you can get your ticket validated at a gift shop, bar, or the front desk, so grab a coffee or a drink beforehand and make sure you confirm it's validated or free before you walk to the showroom to avoid an unexpected exit fee . it's covered and open 24/7 .  
  
if the eldorado garage looks crazy, don’t panic. since it’s part of ""the row,"" the silver legacy and circus circus garages are right next door and also offer free parking for patrons . they are all basically connected, so parking in the silver legacy garage and walking over is an easy backup plan that usually saves a few minutes of circling.  
  
critical insider tip: the show is on a sunday, 11/30. this is a huge win. street parking meters downtown are enforced monday through saturday until 6 pm, but they are \*free\* all day on sunday . try looking for a metered spot a couple of blocks west of virginia street. the show starts at 4:00 pm, so you can park, walk over, and not worry about a meter expiring. this will be your cheapest, most traffic-free option if you can snag one.  
  
if everything is jammed up, the city hall parking garage is super close and only costs around $2-$4 for a few hours, same with the park and lock lot on n center st . it's a solid, cheap fail-safe near the reno events center.  
  
valet is always an option if you’re running late, but expect to pay around $15, and the line can be long both on the way in and out .  
  
arrive about 45 minutes to an hour early to give yourself a relaxed time cushion, especially since it's a holiday show and traffic might be a little heavier than a normal sunday afternoon.

We're in our mid to late twenties.

We met on a lesbian dating app, she likes me first and then we match. She initates the flirting, asks me questions and calls me cute.

She went dry once (hadn't responded in a few days) and I double texted. She gave me her number saying she responds quicker and encouraging me to double text because she gets caught up. I text it, we chat, send reaction memes, and I ask her out

The date went great. Lots of chemistry, extended the date, went out for italian food, brought me a book, i initated holding hands, flirted, SHE broke the touch barrier, and she asks to kiss me, strokes my hair

She mentions at the end of the date for a second one, then she tells me again over text that she'd love to take me out again and how endearing I was. 

It went dry for several days, she says she sick and asks me if I'm okay with postponing. Which i believe, cause my city had a ton of cases

Ive double texted one other time or two, she's replied but this time it's been almost two weeks and no answer. 

One thing I will say that keeps me from assuming the worst and moving on, is that she's a professor teaching about 4 to 5 classes, and I as a (she's not my professor)student, know that this is the busiest time of year for college. Projects due, papers and exams. When she replied saying she was sick she told me she had about 300 papers she had to get into.

When she does get back to me, she asks how my week has been and things. On one hand, everyone has their phone, but on another she seems extremely busy, 10 hour shifts, grading then office hours, this was just one date she has no obligation to me

But, she did make time for me for our date, was very engaged and in my interests and set the whole thing up, and I don't want to triple text her especially on Thanksgiving and the break

I'm working 36 hours a week and in 5 classes, and I feel like dying, so I can truly imagine her end. She works 10 hours a day, along with office hours

TLDR: We met on a dating app, she initates the flirting, and has gone dry. She slipped her number to me, saying she encourages me to double text and she gets caught up. we move off the app, some convo then I ask her out. Our coffee date is filled with chemistry, laughs, nerdy convos, she breaks the touch barrier, suggests italian food which she offered to buy,  we move to a bookstore, she buys me a book, we hold hands, we flirt, and at the end of the date she initates a kiss and plays with my hair. She suggests a 2nd date in person and again over text. 

She's a professor, teaching 4 or 5 classes, and she has been open about how her job is extremely busy. Its been 15 days since I heard back from her, texted last Saturday, and there hasn't been a response. I'm assuming she'll get back to me, but I don't want to triple text, but at the same time I'm willing to do that i just don't want to come off as clingy or obsessive.

Dating apps have shown me every kind of person the broken ones, the unexpectedly questionable ones, and the ones who teach you things you weren’t ready to learn. I think some of the best connections don’t die because of a lack of love, but because of money or the way money makes people feel.

Not in the dramatic rich-vs-poor sense, but in the soft, quiet ways we’re shaped by our childhood, by comfort, by security. I grew up with enough stability not to panic over a meal, a cab, or a cup of coffee. Not luxury, just ease. But even that made some men label me “high maintenance” before they even knew my heart.

Then I met someone who changed everything. Someone I cared for more than I expected. He didn’t grow up with the same safety net. He had money sometimes, and none at others. He saved in odd corners, then spent recklessly where it didn’t matter, trying to prove he could keep up with an expectation I never placed on him.

Every bill turned into a silent balancing act. Not because I minded paying, but because he hated having to ask me. And the strange part is I never wanted expensive dates or performative romance. I wanted simplicity. A walk instead of a restaurant. Cooking dinner instead of scrolling through menus. A love that didn’t need price tags to feel real. I wanted us just us without the weight of worthiness attached to money.

But he never believed he was enough. His insecurities grew louder than my reassurance, and love slowly drowned in that gap. Pride, fear, and shame are three things that can choke a relationship even when the heart is willing :///

And I won’t lie I miss him. Not the idea of him. Not the potential of him. Him. The imperfect, real, trying version. The way he felt grounded and human in a world where everyone is busy curating perfection.

There’s a scene in the Materialist movie where the couple fights over a tiny parking fee and at first it’s about the money, until it isn’t. It becomes about pride, insecurity, and the fear of not being enough. Watching it felt like watching my own story. Except in the movie, they somehow find their way back to each other. They choose each other again. And I hate how deeply I wished real life worked the same way.

I wish things were different.  
I wish he could’ve seen what I was offering.  
I wish he knew I would’ve chosen him even in simplicity.",1,1764348747.0,offmychest,2,0.99,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’m a truly hopeless romantic. Give me cliché stuff, gentle romance, quiet nights, cute dates, sharing life with my person, making memories, all that classic relationship stuff. But here comes the tricky bit: I’m asexual. Meaning I’m not up for anything sexual, *ever*. Which, to no surprise, has made my love life a bit challenging. I said this is a shot in the dark, didn’t I?

I offer dry humour, teasing as a love language, random info dumps and loads of cuddles. Needless to say, I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and is happy without any bedroom activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll strike it lucky and you’re ace too! **So, in a nutshell**, I’m looking for a monogamous long term relationship. Easier said than done, being ace, but never say never!

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some!

**Who I am:**

* atheist and progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, you get it)
* childfree
* chubby and short, short dark hair (but it changes, it’s been blue, purple, red…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* city girl, love culture, museums, theatre, musicals, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into writing, reading, photography, fashion, city holidays, binging tv shows

* sadly very allergic to pets

**Who I’m looking for:**

1p8zpb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CookingwithDebs/comments/1p8zpb1/essential_skills_dairy_basics_for_home_cooks/,"Essential Skills: Dairy Basics for Home Cooks — Simple Explanations, Better Results","**Essential Skills Series: Dairy**

**About This Series**  
Each section is designed to help you *Spread Your Wings* in a culinary sense, giving you clear, reliable skills you can use every day.

**About This Section**  
This section explains the fundamentals of working with milk and cream — how different types behave in cooking and baking, why fat and protein content change the outcome, how to choose the right one for the job, and what each *does* in a recipe. Dairy controls far more than moisture and richness, and understanding how it works ensures predictable, consistent results.

These basics help your sauces, custards, and baked goods turn out the way you expect instead of curdling, breaking, failing to thicken, or losing structure and tenderness.

 

**Milk**

There are several types of fresh cow’s milk available, each defined by its fat percentage, and this affects texture and how recipes turn out. It can be frozen if needed—just shake or whisk after thawing to bring it back together.

 

**Whole Milk (3.25% fat):** The standard for most recipes. The fat helps with tenderness, browning, and moisture retention.  
**Best for:** cakes, muffins, custards, sauces, biscuits, dinner rolls, mashed potatoes.

**2% Milk:** Lighter but still reliable. Works fine in most recipes that call for whole milk, though results may be slightly less rich.  
**Best for:** everyday baking, lighter sauces, quick breads.

**1% and Skim:** Much thinner, with less body. It can cause curdling in sauces and a drier crumb in baked goods.  
**Use only when:** the recipe specifically calls for it, or richness doesn’t matter.

**Lactose-Free Milk:** Lactose is broken down into simpler sugars, so the flavor is slightly sweeter, but it behaves almost the same as regular milk in cooking and baking.  
**Best for:** any recipe that calls for milk when lactose is an issue.  
**Side note:** For some people with lactose intolerance, milk used in baked goods or cooked recipes may be easier to tolerate than drinking it straight. Heating doesn’t remove lactose, but the way the body digests it in a mixed recipe can make symptoms less noticeable. Everyone’s tolerance is different.

**Raw Milk:** Unpasteurized milk has a different enzyme and bacteria profile, which can affect how it behaves when gently heated.  
**Safety note:** Raw (unpasteurized) milk can contain harmful bacteria that pasteurization removes. Avoid using it in recipes that stay below a full simmer—like custards, sauces, or warm drinks—and use only when the milk will be fully cooked.

**Evaporated Milk:** Milk with \~60% of the water removed. Creamier, slightly caramelized flavor.  
**Best for:** custard-style pies (like pumpkin or sweet potato), old-fashioned fudge, casseroles, mac-and-cheese.

**Sweetened Condensed Milk:** Evaporated milk with lots of added sugar. Thick, sticky, and sweet.  
**Best for:** no-churn ice cream, icebox pies, key lime pie, magic bars.

**Note:** milk can scorch or separate with rapid boiling — gentle heat gives the best texture.

**Creams:** With more fat than milk, creams add richness, body, and a smoother texture in both sweet and savory recipes. Not all creams whip—only those with the highest fat content will, while lower-fat versions have a greater tendency to split when heated. Even full-fat cream benefits from gentle heat to maintain a smooth texture. Creams can be frozen for cooking, but won’t whip once thawed.

# Half-and-half (10–18% fat)

Half milk, half cream. Adds mild richness but won’t whip.  
**Best for:** coffee, soups, and some desserts.  
**Note:** Can curdle in acidic or high-heat sauces—add slowly over gentle heat.

# Light cream (18–30% fat)

Slightly richer than half-and-half but still won’t whip well.  
**Best for:** creamy sauces and chowders.  
**Note:** More likely to split if boiled or combined with acidic ingredients.

# Whipping cream (30–35% fat)

Lower in fat than heavy cream. It will whip, but with softer peaks and less stability.  
**Best for:** toppings, lighter whipped creams, enriching soups and sauces—not ideal for ganache or piping.

# Heavy cream (also called heavy whipping cream, 36% fat)

Contains the highest fat content of any liquid dairy. Thick, rich, whips beautifully, and adds luxurious texture.  
**UK equivalent:** double cream (\~48% fat), which whips even more easily.  
**Best for:** whipped cream, ganache, alfredo sauce, ice cream, creamy soups.  
**Notes:**  
• Ultra-pasteurized cream has a longer shelf life but takes longer to whip and may not hold its shape as well as regular (pasteurized) cream.  
• Do not shake heavy cream—its high butterfat can thicken or begin whipping when agitated. If separation occurs, gently tilt or swirl the container to recombine without incorporating air.  
• Will not whip after thawing.

**Buttermilk**

Modern cultured buttermilk is tangy and slightly thick, with acidity that tenderizes baked goods and activates baking soda for lift. It’s not the same as traditional buttermilk—the thin liquid left after churning butter—and behaves differently from regular milk in recipes.

  
**Liquid Buttermilk:**  
Acidic, tangy, and tenderizing. Activates baking soda and helps create a soft, delicate crumb.

**Best for:** pancakes, biscuits, scones, cornbread, and fried-chicken brines.  
**Also useful for:** tenderizing poultry, pork, and mild game (such as rabbit, venison, or elk), where its gentle acidity helps soften the meat and reduce stronger flavors. It’s less effective for very fatty or strongly flavored game like goose or boar.

**Storage:** Keep refrigerated and shake well before using—liquid buttermilk naturally separates, and shaking recombines it for even thickness.

**Powdered Buttermilk:**  
Shelf-stable and budget-friendly, but the package directions make it much thinner than carton buttermilk.

**Storage:** Keep tightly sealed in a cool, dry place. The container isn’t fully airtight, so for best results place it inside a sealed freezer-style bag or transfer to an airtight container. Some brands suggest refrigeration after opening to extend freshness—check your label.

**How to Use for Baking**

·        Mix the powder with about half to two-thirds of the water the package calls for

·        Whisk and let rest 2–3 minutes, then whisk again and reassess

·        If it’s too thin**:** whisk in 1–2 teaspoons of powder, let rest 2–3 minutes, whisk again, then reassess

·        If it’s too thick: add 1–2 teaspoons of water at a time, whisk, and reassess until it reaches a thick, pourable consistency (similar to cultured buttermilk)

·        For accuracy, measure the buttermilk after it has been mixed, rested, and adjusted

**Why it matters:**  
Too-thin buttermilk can lead to:

·        runny pancake or biscuit batter

·        weak structure

·        flat, dense results

**Notes:**

·        Powdered buttermilk is a great backup for baking, but the powder-to-water ratio makes it much thinner than carton buttermilk. Using less water helps it behave more like the real thing, though it will never match the exact thickness or texture of cultured buttermilk.

·        A common emergency substitute is mixing milk with lemon juice or vinegar, but it won’t thicken like cultured buttermilk. It provides acidity for baking, but not the same flavor or tenderness.

**Did You Know?**  
Traditional buttermilk was the thin, tangy liquid left over after churning cream into butter. Today’s buttermilk is completely different—it’s cultured milk, made by adding live bacteria to low-fat milk to thicken it and create that signature tang. Older recipes often assume the traditional kind, which is why modern results don’t always match unless the recipe has been updated.

 

# Powdered milk

Shelf-stable dried milk that’s useful to keep on hand when fresh milk isn’t available or you don’t go through milk quickly. Most grocery stores carry nonfat versions; whole milk powder is richer but harder to find. Powdered milk doesn’t taste the same as fresh milk for drinking, and it won’t add the richness of whole milk, so it’s not ideal for recipes that rely on dairy fat.

Common uses:  
• bread baking (improves tenderness and browning)  
• homemade hot chocolate mixes  
• enrichment for soups or casseroles  
• backup for emergency baking

To reconstitute: whisk into warm water until dissolved.  
Let sit for 1–2 minutes to hydrate, then whisk again.  
If lumps remain, strain through a fine sieve.

**Storage:**  
• keep tightly sealed to prevent clumping and off-flavors  
• best within 3–6 months after opening  
• store in a cool, dry place away from heat and humidity

# Quick substitution:

# To make 1 cup of milk:

• 1 cup water + about 3 tbsp powdered milk (follow brand directions for exact amounts)

#  

# Coconut milk/Cream

Coconut milk and cream are made by blending coconut flesh with water. It comes in cans and larger shelf-stable cartons for cooking—not the refrigerated carton in the dairy case, which is a drinkable version and behaves differently. Most recipes (especially Indian or Thai) are written for the canned or shelf-stable cooking kind, and using the wrong one can change the texture and outcome.

# Coconut milk

Coconut milk used in cooking is naturally thick and high in fat. It separates into a solid layer on top and liquid underneath—whisk or blend until smooth. If the solid layer looks slightly gray or dull, that can be normal; discard only if you see pink discoloration, mold, or a sour smell.  
Best for: curries, soups, baking, and sauces.

**How to use it:**  
• shake before opening, then whisk or blend until smooth  
• add toward the end of cooking for the best texture  
• simmer gently — rapid boiling can cause separation

**Skimming the cream:** the thick layer that forms on top can be scooped and used like coconut cream in small amounts for added richness, but consistency varies by brand.

**Note:** You can make coconut milk at home by blending fresh coconut flesh with warm water and straining through cheesecloth. Homemade versions can separate more easily, so most recipes are written for canned or shelf-stable coconut milk.

**Storage:**  
• transfer leftover coconut milk from a can to an airtight container before refrigerating  
• the fat will solidify when chilled — warm gently and whisk to recombine  
• use within 3–5 days  
• can be frozen, but may separate when thawed — blending will help smooth it out

# Coconut cream

Coconut cream is very thick and rich — essentially the fat layer of coconut milk.  
Not the same as cream of coconut, which is sweetened and used for drinks and desserts.  
Works in many recipes where richness is needed, but not as a universal 1:1 substitute for dairy cream.  
Best for: dairy-free whipped cream, ganache, custards, thickening soups.

Not a direct replacement in dairy-dependent recipes like mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, or alfredo.

**How to use it:**  
• use straight from the can for very rich results  
• whisk to smooth before adding to recipes

**Heat behavior:** coconut cream can simmer gently, but vigorous boiling or strong acids may cause separation.

**Thinning coconut cream:**  
• mix with 1–2 tablespoons of water per 1/2 cup to make coconut milk  
• adjust until it reaches the consistency you need

**Whipped coconut cream:**  
• chill the can overnight before whipping  
• yields a firmer, more stable result than skimming from coconut milk

**Storage:**  
• refrigerate after opening and use within 3–5 days  
• it will solidify when chilled — warm gently and whisk to soften

# Light coconut milk

Light coconut milk is full-fat coconut milk diluted with water. It has less fat, **but not fewer calories**, and the thinner texture means it won’t provide the same richness.

Best for: smoothies, porridges, light soups, and recipes where a subtle coconut flavor is enough.

Not ideal for: sauces, custards, or anything that relies on creaminess — it’s more likely to separate when heated.

**How it behaves:**  
• heats less reliably than full-fat  
• can break or look grainy when boiled  
• won’t whip or thicken

 

# Other plant-based milks

Non-dairy milks vary widely in thickness, fat content, sweetness, and how they behave when heated. Some work well in cooking and baking, while others are better for drinking or cold uses.

# Common options

**Almond milk:** very thin with low fat and a mild, slightly nutty flavor.  
Best for: drinking, smoothies, cold cereal.  
Not ideal for: sauces or heating — can curdle or separate.

**Oat milk:** creamier with a mild oaty flavor that some people find neutral.  
Best for: coffee, baking, and general use.  
May thicken slightly when heated.

**Soy milk:** highest protein with a noticeable beany flavor that not everyone enjoys.  
Best for: custards, baking, and cooking.  
Closest performance to dairy in structure.

**Coconut milk (drinkable carton):** thin and usually fortified, with a mild coconut flavor.  
Best for: drinking, smoothies, and cold uses.  
Not ideal for: cooking — behaves more like almond or oat milk and won’t replace canned coconut milk in recipes.

**Pea-based milks:** higher protein with a more savory, neutral-but-not-sweet flavor; varies by brand.  
Best for: cooking, coffee, and savory uses.  
Flavor depends heavily on formulation.

**Rice milk:** very thin, naturally sweeter, and mild.  
Best for: drinking or light baking.  
Not ideal for heat — can separate and won’t add body.

**Cashew milk:** richer and creamier than almond with one of the most neutral flavors.  
Best for: soups, creamy sauces, and blending.  
Smooth texture because it blends fully.

# Original vs extra-creamy

Many plant-based milks come in two versions.  
Original is thinner—closer to 2% dairy milk—while extra-creamy has added fat or stabilizers for a richer texture.

**Use extra-creamy when you want:**  
• better results in baking  
• creamier sauces or soups  
• fewer chances of curdling  
• dairy-like body in coffee

**Use original when you want:**  
• drinking, cereal, smoothies  
• lighter texture  
• thinner consistency in recipes

Extra-creamy won’t behave exactly like dairy, but it performs more predictably in cooking and heat.

**Important:** choose unsweetened for cooking and baking—vanilla and sweetened versions can change flavor and browning.

Choosing the right plant-based milk depends on thickness, flavor, and how it handles heat—there’s no single substitute that works in every recipe.

 

# Quick note: Ideas for using coffee creamers

Coffee creamers (like Coffee-mate or International Delight) are non-dairy, flavored, and sweet, and it’s easy to end up with more than you need for just coffee. Here are a few ways to use creamers so they don’t go to waste.

Creamers can work in small amounts to add sweetness and flavor to:  
• French toast  
• baked oatmeal  
• sweet breads  
• dessert glazes  
• pancake or waffle batter  
• overnight oats  
• quick breads (like banana bread)  
• powdered-sugar icing

They are *not* a substitute for milk in custards, sauces, or recipes that rely on dairy structure—creamers contain sweeteners and stabilizers, so they behave differently from milk.

**Tips:**  
• use sparingly—a little goes a long way  
• start with 1–2 tablespoons in batters or glazes  
• avoid high heat to prevent thickening or gumming",1,1764348644.0,u_CookingwithDebs,0,1.0,False

In the past, after a holiday I would wake up late, dehydrated af, & feeling like shit. Today, I am reminiscing on my DUI which was about 2 years ago now. I haven’t drank and drove since. I caused me to wake up to needing some big behavioral changes. If you are feeling terrible right now , just do what you gotta do. Get the requirements done. Go day by day. Take it seriously and make changes. It can be hard to pull yourself out of bad habits and routines but you can do it. You aren’t a bad person for getting a DUI and you can prevent it from ever happening again. You will get past it. Count your blessings and hang in there.

But unlike her or her mom I don’t smoke or drink coffee so can’t replace my meals with that. And have instead succumbed to forgetting to unfreeze something or waiting too long until it’s 3pm and ordering Uber Eats and eating incredibly unhealthy. I want to stop this, but keep failing and falling to bad habits and have seriously thought of just starting smoking.

So here i am asking for help on the internet, What is a good sustainable way to eat healthy and good food at home? 

Do you plan your meal the day before? What time do you start cooking? How do you keep it varied?  How do you plan so that vegetables don’t go bad?

1p8zmfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tech4LocalBusiness/comments/1p8zmfe/does_every_local_business_really_need_a_mobile/,Does every local business really need a mobile app? Or is it just a shiny distraction?,"There’s this huge push for local businesses to get their own mobile app, especially with all the “you need an app to compete in 2025!” messages flying around. But do we actually need one? Or is it just another marketing buzzword?

Here’s my take:

Pros:

* **Loyalty programs and rewards:** A lot of local businesses use apps to reward repeat customers. For coffee shops or gyms, it could be a good way to build loyalty.
* **Push notifications:** You can send out sales, events, or limited-time offers directly to people’s phones. I get that this feels personal, and people seem to engage more with notifications than they do with emails.
* **Convenience for repeat customers:** Some businesses, like restaurants, benefit from having an app that lets customers reorder or book faster.
* **Branding:** There’s something cool about having an app that feels like an extension of your business. It gives you that tech-savvy edge.



Cons:

* **Cost & maintenance:** Building and maintaining an app is expensive. The costs aren’t just upfront. You’ve got ongoing updates, bug fixes, and making sure it works across all phones.
* **Over-saturation of apps:** People already have 500 apps on their phones. Most don’t need another one unless you’re giving them something super compelling.
* **Customer adoption:** Getting customers to actually download your app is a whole separate challenge. If you don’t have a super strong incentive, people aren’t going to bother.
* **Complexity for small businesses:** If you’re a one-person shop or a small team, managing an app might not be worth the time investment compared to other marketing efforts like social media or email.

For some businesses (fast food chains and loyalty programs), a mobile app makes total sense. But for most small businesses? I’m honestly not sure it’s necessary. A simple, responsive website might get the job done just as well, especially if you can integrate payment and booking systems.

I woke up to the yellow rays,
Falling on the white outside.
The room smells like nothing —
Oh, the emptiness so soothing.

Though I’m a social creature,
Solitude feels like home.
It’s all too much sometimes,
To manage the chaos people bring.

I cooked some eggs,
Fed the dog his meal,
Took him to play outside
While shovelling the driveway.

I drove so fast,
My cigarette burned too quick,
The coffee got too cold,
The music got distorted.

I reached the final lake,
Which was almost frozen.

And thought of all that never moved.

Been thinking a lot about the Lightning Network lately and wanted to get your thoughts.

Basically, it’s a way to make Bitcoin transactions super fast and almost free. Forget waiting for confirmations or paying high fees – with Lightning, you could buy a coffee and have it approved before the barista even finishes making it.

It feels like this could be a game-changer for using BTC in the real world.

So, I’m curious to know what you all think:

If local businesses here in New Brunswick and the Maritimes started accepting Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, would you actually use it?

1p8zfx3,https://i.redd.it/svtketpi014g1.png,Entry #1 ((Cutscene Post)),"So... I’m writing in this thing now. They had a whole shelf of notebooks just sitting there, like they wanted someone to take one. No alarms. No traps. No one yelling at me. If they didn’t want me stealing it, they should’ve stopped me. That’s what Surge always said—if they can’t defend it, it’s yours now. She would’ve teased me for taking the blue one, though. “Too obvious,” she’d say. Whatever. It’s mine.

I don’t know why I’m writing this, but after everything that’s happened since I got... dragged here, maybe I need to put my thoughts somewhere that isn’t the inside of my head where everything’s loud and messy. The paper doesn’t yell at me. So that’s already an improvement.

I'm sitting at this metal table outside some café. The music is too cheerful, the chairs squeak, and the wind keeps flipping the pages. I don’t even know what half the things on the menu are. The worker inside tried asking me if I wanted anything but I told them, “I don’t drink... coffee.”
They stared at me like that was weird. Why would I drink something that just makes your heart beat faster? Mine already does that too much. Well, whatever machine is inside me anyways...

A few days ago, I ran into an altercation—I don’t care about learning his name, “the purple weasel"" fits him. The first fight I got into here was with him, right after I landed in this world. He kept calling my water pack “merchandise.” Like it was some toy he could slap a price tag on. Then he tried to shoot it more than once. People here are softer... as it seems usually, but not him. He acts like everything is just some game. I almost drowned him. I didn’t. But I almost did. If I lose the water pack, I’m useless. And I’m not being useless again.

Tails. He’s... not what I was told he would be. Starline showed me a picture but... wow is this one short. We fought. I’m not talking about it.
But he didn’t fight like someone trying to win. He fought like someone trying to figure me out. It was uncomfortable. Annoying. I don’t like when people look at me like that. He said something weird before I left. Something like he “didn’t want to hurt me.” That’s stupid. People don’t mean that. Not to me.

Cream. Too gentle. Too kind. Too… soft.
That makes her dangerous. She said Surge’s name and it felt like someone grabbed my ribs and squeezed. I didn’t mean to snap at her—she just kept talking like she understood something she couldn’t possibly understand. Still... when she apologized, she actually looked sad. Like she cared if she hurt me. Why would she care? She doesn’t even know me. I don’t know how to deal with that.

Then I met some puppet girl made of wood who talks like she’s trying too hard to smile. She’s... strange. Not in a bad way. Just strange. She helped me figure out how I got here. Not everything—just a piece. A flash. Smoke. Me seeing her helped me focus long enough to see that much. She asked if I wanted help.

Surge... I can’t find her. Every time I think I’m close, I’m not. Every person I ask doesn’t know her or has never heard of her or tells me to “calm down” which makes me want to break something. She’s somewhere in this world. She has to be. She wouldn’t leave me behind. She wouldn’t—No. She wouldn’t... I’ll find her. Even if I have to search every city. Every alley. Every rooftop. Every storm cloud. I don’t care how long it takes. I don’t care what I have to do. I’m not losing her. Not again—

Some kid inside the café is staring at me because the table got wet after i spilled my drink. My fault, didn’t mean to. I’m going now before someone decides to “check on me.” I don’t need checking on. I just need her.

A draw? 21%—about the same chance I’d give a toddler negotiating a peace treaty. Let’s break this down.

### Parse the Odds: Why PSG is the Statistical Choice

The numbers scream “PSG, baby!” Their implied win probability (61%) suggests bookmakers view Monaco as a team that trips over its own shoelaces and expects a standing ovation. Monaco’s 5.30 odds mean they’re the underdog, but not in the “underdog逆袭” sense—more like “underdog in a game of chess where PSG has already checkmated you in the opening move.”

The over/under? A 1.43 line on over 2.5 goals implies this could be a high-scoring romp, but the under 3.5 goals (1.78) is oddly attractive. Why? Because PSG’s recent 3-0 drubbing of Havre and Monaco’s leaky defense (three straight losses, including 1-4 to Rennes) suggest a middle-ground: enough goals to satisfy your grandma’s knitting patterns but not enough to make you question your life choices.

### Digest the News: Fatigue, Complacency, and Why Monaco’s “Solid Start” Feels Like a Mirage

Monaco’s season is a rollercoaster that’s suddenly hit the brakes: they started strong, then got stuck in a loop of “1-4 defeats” and “Champions League progress that feels like a consolation prize.” They’re playing two fronts like a student pulling all-nighters for exams while working a 9-to-5. Fatigue? Check. Lack of consistency? Check. A defense that’s tighter than a jar of expired mayonnaise? Double check.

PSG, meanwhile, is the Elon Musk of football: wealthy, inconsistent in execution but always *seemingly* ahead. They’ve won three straight, including a 3-0 thrashing that made Havre question their life choices. Their “deep squad” means they treat matches like a bottomless coffee cup—refil

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This document details the highly optimized, two-tiered software architecture designed and implemented by **Z & R Wholesale & Distributors** to achieve scalable multi-channel growth. The system minimizes TCO while maintaining functional parity with monolithic enterprise solutions while guaranteeing **fault-tolerance** and **regulatory compliance**.

# Pillar 1: Unified Transactional Logic and Access Control

Our primary challenge involved orchestrating distinct transactional workflows (B2C and B2B) within a single Core COTS E-commerce Platform while ensuring **adherence to local governance and regulations**.

* **The Strategy (Tiered Pricing Engine):** We integrated a dedicated **Tiered Pricing Engine** microservice into the Core COTS E-commerce Platform's data model. This engine dynamically enforces pricing schemas based on authenticated user attributes.
* **The Functionality:** This module facilitates the application of automated **discount volume pricing**, while strictly enforcing **taxation compliance** and adherence to **local jurisdiction rules**. This **governance mandate** is critical for maintaining the integrity of our high-value **jewelry** and **furniture** inventories and ensuring legal operational posture.

# Pillar 2: Asynchronous Supply Chain Synchronization Fabric

To support a high-velocity, low-latency inventory model without incurring large warehousing CapEx, we deployed an advanced fulfillment orchestration layer featuring inherent **redundancy**.

* **The Strategy (Fulfillment Orchestration):** We leverage an **API-driven Fulfillment Orchestration Layer** that acts as an abstraction plane between the DTC E-commerce Facade and external supplier APIs. This system ensures **real-time inventory synchronization** and manages asynchronous order propagation across redundant supplier endpoints.
* **The System Integrity:** This solution guarantees idempotency in transaction processing and utilizes **multi-source redundancy protocols** to ensure business continuity and eliminate single points of failure. This is essential for maintaining accuracy across our highly fluid **designer fragrance deals** and **fashion** SKUs.

# Executive Summary (Advisory-Level Architectural Governance)

Based on our **Executive-level Architectural Governance**, the success of **Z & R Wholesale & Distributors** is predicated on technical execution, **systemic redundancy**, and **proactive regulatory adherence**.

* **Key Mandates:** The successful deployment of the **Tiered Pricing Engine** and the **Supply Chain Synchronization Fabric** ensures compliance with **local rules and governing regulations**, optimizes Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and enables the continuous, scalable delivery of high-value **retail deals** to the consumer base without compromising system integrity or operational uptime. This is the optimal strategy for modern **DTC E-commerce Facade** growth.

*Where football meets fireworks, and the only thing spicier than the rivalry is the odds board.*

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

Let’s start with the cold, hard cash of statistics. Fenerbahçe is the slight favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **2.17** (FanDuel: 2.2, DraftKings: 2.15). Converting that to implied probability? **\~46% chance to win**. Galatasaray, the league leaders, trail at **\~32%** (averaging 3.1 odds), while the draw sits at **\~30%**. Bookmakers are pricing this like a high-stakes poker game: Fenerbahçe has the chip lead, but Galatasaray’s wildcard ace (their “I’m the leader” swagger) could still shock the table.

The spread? Fenerbahçe is favored by **-0.25 goals**, meaning you’d bet on them with a half-goal deficit to win. It’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We think they’re better, but don’t expect them to blow this out.” The over/under is **2.75 goals**, with “under” priced slightly lower (1.83–1.91). In other words, brace for a tactical duel, not a fireworks show.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Banners

Fenerbahçe has been on a tear, rattling off **11 consecutive unbeaten matches** (8 wins, 3 draws) since September 2024. Their recent 1-1 Europa League draw with Ferencváros? A minor speed bump, not a crisis. Under Domenico Tedesco, they’ve mastered the art of grinding out results—like a coffee addict who’s already had three espressos but insists they’re “completely fine.”

Galatasaray, meanwhile, sits atop the league but carries the weight of expectation like a turkey on Thanksgiving. No major injury updates are mentioned, but let’s not forget: this is a derby. Emotions run hotter than a Turkish coffee pot, and even the most composed players might crack under the pressure of 50,000 fans chan

Not sure if it’s the right place for such a post, but I am planning to install an Intel Core i3-9100F on my MSI H110M PRO-VD motherboard. This is my first time attempting the ""Coffee Lake on Skylake"" mod, so I want to make sure I don't fry anything.
Here are the specifics:
• CPU: i3-9100F with the spec code SRF7W. From what I understand, this confirms it is the B0 stepping (technically Kaby Lake based).
• Motherboard: MSI H110M PRO-VD.
My confusion:
I know I need to modify the BIOS (using CoffeeTime), but I am confused about the physical modifications for this specific stepping (B0) on this specific board.
1. Since it is a B0 stepping, do I still need to isolate/tape any pins on the CPU?
2. Do I need to bridge/short any pins?
3. Are there any specific quirks with MSI H110 boards I should be aware of regarding the flash procedure (do I absolutely need a CH341A programmer)?

I know na napag iiwanan na ko and I wanna do something about it for me and for my kids na din. Di ko lang alam kung paano at saan magsstart now that I'm 30 na.  

Context: I'm 30F, High school grad (ALS). Di ako nakapag college since sobrang hirap na ng family ko, sobrang problematic pa yung tipong parang mag isa na lang ako sa buhay. Nagbabantay lang ako sa  tindahan ng kapit -bahay para may pangbaon sa school at pangkain. Natapos ko yung hs through ALS kasi napagod na ko pumasok ng school araw-araw tapos puyat sa pagbabantay. 

After ko mag ALS, naubos yung 4 yrs (di ako sure basta ganyang years) sa iba't-ibang short-time na work like bantay ng bata, tindahan, kainan ganyan. Nawala na din sa isip ko yung pagcollege since wala naman talaga magpapa-aral sa'kin, di ko rin kayang pag aralin sarili ko tulad ng iba. Kayang sobrang nalulungkot ako para sa sarili ko, feeling sobrang hina ko. Bakit yung iba nakaya nila pag aralin sarili nila? Ako ang kaya ko lang eh mapakain sarili ko sa isang araw. Haha 

Hanggang sa na meet ko partner (23 sya ng time na to) ko, nag live-in kami nung 20 ako, sobrang saya ko. May mauuwian na kong bahay na maayos at tahimik. Student pa lang sya pero suportado kami ng mama nya nasa abroad. Nagwork pa din ako sa kainan until I got pregnant at 21 then stopped working hanggang sa mag 4 y/o ang anak namin.

Someone I knew knows na I love art at tinuruan ako mag decorate ng cake. Feeling ko ang galing ko dito. I worked at coffee shop that sells cake for 3 years hanggang sa nabuntis naman ako sa youngest namin. I was devastated kasi wala na talaga ko balak sundan but then di ko alam, may contraceptive naman pero nabuntis pa din. I stopped working again at ngayon full-time mom na. Yung partner ko naman ay may magandang work kaya okay okay pa naman kami financially pero yung relationship naman namin ang hindi. 

After almost 11 yrs, he cheated. He doesn't know it yet na alam ko na and i don't have plans to confront him agad since nasa malayo sya , who knows what will happen? Ayokong maging madalos-dalos since may 2 kaming anak. Gusto ko na lang muna mag plano because I'm scared for me and my kids, pag naghiwalay kami I know na magsusustento sya pero alam kong need ko kumayod nang mag-isa para sa'min.

I wanna think about the near future na agad, pag nag work ulit wala akong mapag iiwanan ng anak namin, takot akong ipagkatiwala s iba at family for so many reasons and trauma. I wanna work from home pero wala talaga akong skills and knowledge sa computer. Tngna nayayamot na ko sa sarili ko, nanliliit ako. Di ko alam saan ako magsstart, gusto ko maging ready in case na maghiwalay na kami. Ayoko na maging kawawa at maranasan ng mga anak ko yung naranasan ko nung bata ako. 


Previous attempt: Nagtry ako magsell ng cake online pero nalugi lang, sobrang baba ng kita kaya nagstop na lang ako since I don't think it'll be enough para sa panggastos namin in case we're on our own na. 

Pls no harsh words muna, I'm so emotional right now.

Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of pakka friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might aswell spend it with your best friend for life.

I want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

How do we do this? be it to grab a cozy coffee, chat the day away or maybe watch a movie. Let's connect! Let me get to know you.

No tricks, only treats - just two humans trying to make the most of this time before the Mariah Carey Christmas takeover begins.

1p8z31k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8z31k,"Just shipped my own French-learning macOS companion (built as a learner, for learners) – would love feedback","Hey All,

I’m learning French and got tired of the usual pattern: cute streak apps, locked content, everything phoning home to some server. So I built **Apprendre**, a French “language workbench” that just lives on your Mac, works offline and private.

**What it is (right now)**

* You paste/type any French text and get: instant English translation, sentence audio, and word‑by‑word breakdown along with phonetic cues in one place.
* You can bookmark your fav or complex words and jump back into the exact sentence later, so reviews always have context instead of random isolated vocab. You can build vocabs for future revisions
* You can ask things like “How do I order coffee?” and the local LLM builds a small, focused lesson with phrases you can actually use.​

**Under the hood / why it’s different**

* 100% on‑device: apart from the initial model download, all translation, pronunciation, and lesson planning runs locally. No tracking, no selling data, no account.
* Uses macOS system TTS, so you get native‑quality voices and can flip between speakers in settings instead of being stuck with one robotic voice.
* One‑time “pay what you want” (minimum 5 USD) for lifetime access to Pro features and future versions; no subscriptions, no dark patterns.​ You can download for free if you want just this version.

**Where it’s going (roadmap in plain English)**

* Phase 1 (now): solid workbench for serious learners – local translation, clean UI, good audio, distraction‑free.
* Phase 2: proper curriculum with DELF‑style paths (A1–B2), reading/writing helpers, and lightweight progress tracking.
* Phase 3: on‑device speaking tutor with role‑plays, pronunciation scoring, and real‑time voice conversations.
* Phase 4: an adaptive tutor that actually remembers your weak spots and builds lessons around them instead of making you redo the same random exercises.​

**Why I’m posting here**

I built *Apprendre* because I’m learning French myself and was annoyed enough to code my own tool instead of forcing Duolingo to be something it isn’t. If you’re a serious learner on macOS (DELF, immigration, work, long‑term move, etc.), I’d love your feedback on:

* What’s missing for it to become a daily driver for you?
* Anything confusing or over‑engineered in the current flow?
* Features you’d *actually* use during a 30‑minute focused session?

* Product Hunt Page (launch today) : [https://www.producthunt.com/products/apprendre-master-french-privately](https://www.producthunt.com/products/apprendre-master-french-privately)

1p8z1g7,https://i.redd.it/iq3rk2fpx04g1.jpeg,Looking for I Won't Repeat The Same Mistake free link,"Chapter 1
In my previous life, Corbin Hatfield's beloved first love died because of me. Heartbroken, he pretended to marry me for the family's benefit and then used every means possible to drive my family into bankruptcy.
He tormented me until I suffered from severe depression, driving me to despair and ultimately to jump from a building.
In the moment before my death, Corbin stood coldly in front of me, covering my eyes with his hand.
""Aubrey, if you meet Mel and me in your next life, remember to stay away from us.""
When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to seven years ago, on the school path I took every day.
In the distance, Corbin and Melanie Calhoun were walking towards me.
Melanie spotted me first, happily waving in my direction.
""Aubrey! We're over here!""
My dazed mind was instantly jolted into panic. I reacted as if I'd seen ghosts, violently throwing my backpack at them before turning and sprinting away!
""Aubrey! Class is about to start! Where are you going?""
Ignoring my classmate's shouts, I ran alone against the current of students in uniforms.
The wind carried the sunlight with it, slipping quietly through me over and over.
It was wonderful!
Being alive was wonderful!
The heavy burden I shouldered in my previous life was gone.
Now, I was a seventeen-year-old Aubrielle Cooper.
Healthy, lively, bright.
The Cooper and Hatfield families had been close for generations. Corbin was a year older than me and had always been particularly doting on me since childhood.
From a piece of candy in early childhood, to princess dresses in our youth, to the sapphire necklace on my sixteenth birthday, his kindness filled a full third of my life.
Many girls liked him, but I was the only one by his side.
He was like an older brother to me, and also someone I had quietly begun to love.
Everything changed during the school's freshman sports meeting when I suddenly fainted, and it was Melanie who took me to the infirmary.
From then on, there was a Melanie between Corbin and me.
They shared similar hobbies, were both outstanding in character and academics, and always had endless things to talk about when they were together.
I gradually became the invisible one in the trio.
***
In my previous life, the story of Melanie being assaulted by her stepfather spread throughout the entire campus.
Before she jumped off, her hair was disheveled, and she stared at me with fierce hatred.
""Aubrielle, remember this! You are the one who killed me!""
Then she resolutely jumped, giving no one any time to pull her back.
Not even... giving me a chance to explain.
Corbin went mad after seeing the note she left.
He gripped my shoulders tightly, his crimson eyes burning with a hatred that terrified me.
""Aubrielle! Why? Why would you do this?
""You were the only one who knew about this!""
""I...""
My throat tightened repeatedly. I barely managed to endure the sharp pain in my shoulders and force out a few fragmented words.
""I didn't.
""It wasn't me.""
But no one believed me.
Melanie's emphatic accusation before her death had already branded me as the murderer.
Any defense seemed feeble against the victim's direct accusation.
Consequently, I faced unprecedented bullying and isolation.
Everyone saw me as a murderer. Every classmate looked at me with resentment in their eyes.
Especially Corbin.
Four years later, the Hatfield family proposed an alliance marriage with my family. He agreed.
Chapter 2
He seemed to have forgotten all about Melanie, reverting to his incredibly kind and attentive self towards me.
I thought Corbin had finally chosen to believe me.
He ruffled my hair gently, just like he had all our lives, his eyes soft and warm.
""Aubrey, let's get married.""
The Corbin from my memories was always gentle and doting. I thought the old him had returned.
It lasted until the Cooper Group's secrets fell into Corbin's hands. My family's businesses were ruthlessly suppressed by him. My parents were driven out of Birmingham, and I was confined to the house.
Hostility and emotional neglect filled every moment of my existence.
Corbin stopped pretending. The way he looked at me was icy and distant.
""Aubrey, you should taste every bit of the suffering Melanie endured.
""Aubrey, why don't you just die? If you died, I might... be able to forgive you.""
As Corbin wished, seven years later, Aubrielle also jumped from a building, as despairing as Melanie had been.
***
I stood dazedly on the street, the school's class bell still echoing in my ears.
The agony of my skull fracturing, my soul detaching, and Corbin's cold, heartless whisper before my death finally began to recede from my mind.
""Aubrey, if you meet Mel and me in your next life, remember to stay away from us.""
I let out a long, slow breath.
In this life, I will definitely stay far, far away from Corbin and Melanie.
I turned and quickly ran towards home.
""Aubrey? Shouldn't you be in class right now?""
Just inside the door, my mother was sitting in the backyard, leisurely sipping coffee. She was surprised to see me burst in suddenly.
With wet eyes, I rushed forward and hugged her tightly.
In my previous life, their life's work was destroyed. They were driven out of Birmingham by Corbin, whom they had watched grow up, and I didn't even get to see them one last time before I died.
""You're still so clingy with your mom even at this age? What will you do when you get married?""
Above me, my mother's gentle complaint sounded softly.
But I shivered involuntarily at the mention of ""getting married"".
I held her even tighter.
""I won't get married. I'm not going anywhere. I'll stay home, being with you and Dad, relying on our family company, being a trust-fund kid who just lazes around...""
My mother pretended to be helpless, but her smile deepened.
""Is that so? Well, I guess we'll just have to let you, our little freeloader, live off us for life then.""
***
After spending the evening settling my emotions, the next day, I started attending school normally.
The driver dropped me off at the school gate.
As I got out of the car, I glimpsed Corbin and Melanie standing and chatting at the intersection not far away.
That was our usual meeting spot. They were waiting for me.
Terrified of being spotted by them, I quickly ducked my head, grabbed my backpack, and rushed into the school.
On the school path, during our walks as a trio, my eyes were on Corbin, but Corbin's eyes were always on Melanie.
This unrequited love should have ended long ago.
Yet, in my youthful ignorance, I used to secretly rejoice that I could catch one more glimpse of Corbin on that little path.
***
After school, I dawdled as I left. Corbin and Melanie were waiting at the school gate.
There was no avoiding them. I had no choice but to steel myself and walk out.
Chapter 3
Melanie didn't ask me why I had run away at the sight of them yesterday. Instead, she linked her arm with mine as intimately as ever.
""Aubrey! We waited for you for a long time at the intersection today. Why didn't you come?""
I struggled to hold back, but ultimately couldn't stop myself from subtly withdrawing my hand from hers.
Melanie's expression stiffened briefly but quickly returned to normal.
""It's my birthday today, Aubrey. Don't you plan to celebrate with me?""
My heart gave a sudden tremble.
In my previous life, it was on the night of Melanie's birthday that she got drunk. With red-rimmed eyes, we confided in each other, and she unintentionally told me about being assaulted by her stepfather when she was younger.
This time, how could I dare to listen to her secrets again?
I didn't dare look at Corbin standing beside her, only keeping my head down and making up my excuse.
""I... I have something at home. I can't go. Happy Birthday.""
After saying that, I ignored Melanie's instantly reddening eyes, turned, and walked away quickly.
Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded behind me.
""Aubrielle.""
It was Corbin.
My heart lurched in fear, and I walked even faster with my head down.
Corbin caught up with me in just a few strides, blocking my path ahead. His shadow instantly fell over me.
""What are you running from?""
Finally, for the first time, I raised my head to look at Corbin, who had just turned eighteen.
He wore the familiar school uniform, his facial features clear and sharp. But the deep, detached look in his eyes was identical to the Corbin from my previous life.
Suddenly, I realized that an eighteen-year-old Corbin wouldn't look at me with such an expression.
I panicked abruptly, instinctively stepping back a few paces, nearly losing my balance.
Corbin, however, stepped on my shadow as he advanced step by step.
""Aubrielle, you seem... afraid of me?""
The next moment, Corbin's expression suddenly softened. He reached out and ruffled my hair, just like he used to.
""Aubrey, are you feeling unwell? Why are you hiding from Mel and me?
""It's Mel's birthday today. She'll be very sad if you don't come. Let's go celebrate together, okay?""
Corbin was smiling, but I sensed a probing undertone.
It made sense. Since yesterday, my behavior had been rare. I avoided them whenever possible, and I didn't act as eagerly towards Corbin as I had in my past life.
If... Corbin wasn't the eighteen-year-old Corbin either, he would surely suspect whether I was still the seventeen-year-old Aubrey.
After three years of marriage, any feelings I had for Corbin had long vanished.
Now, I felt both hatred and fear towards him.
""I... I...""
I forced a smile, but Corbin had already taken the initiative. He spoke to Jay, who was waiting to pick me up by the roadside, ""Jay, it's a classmate's birthday today. I'll take Aubrey to celebrate and then see her home later.""
Jay, aware of the close relationship between the Cooper and Hatfield families, smiled, nodded, and drove away.
I had no choice but to trail silently behind the two of them.
In the past, during our walks as a trio, I often watched, my heart aching with sorrow, as Corbin and Melanie chatted and laughed. They bonded naturally.
But now, I just looked at them indifferently, my heart completely calm.
I was even planning what excuse I could use to leave early.
***
The night before I jumped to my death was the anniversary of Melanie's death.
Corbin, who was always out enjoying himself, came home for once. He smiled gently and delivered words that pierced my heart.
Chapter 4
""Aubrey, do you remember that time in your senior year when you were cornered in the back alley? I happened to be back at school that day. I stood at the mouth of the alley and watched you for a long time.""
The floor-to-ceiling window reflected my instantly pale face.
That day... I would never forget it.
Some students forced me into the school's back alley. They called me a murderer, took turns slapping me, tore my books to shreds, and scattered them all over the alley.
Finally, they forced me to kneel and say ""I was wrong, Ms. Calhoun"" one hundred times.
I numbly complied with their demands because only then would the bullying end.
On graduation day, I thought it was finally over. I tried my best to forget those humiliating memories and sealed away everything related to Melanie.
I thought I could start over.
But Corbin later told me he had been there all along, on that deeply humiliating day.
That Corbin, who had held my hand since childhood and accompanied me like an older brother as I grew up, had stood somewhere, watching indifferently as I was bullied, hit, insulted, and forced to kneel and apologize.
Corbin leaned close to my ear and continued speaking calmly.
""Oh, and Aubrey, your mother is sick now but has no money for treatment. Your father, at his age, has to work on construction sites. He hurt his back and struggles every day.
""All of this is your fault. They could have lived a life of ease and comfort, but now they have to atone for your mistakes.""
I saw my own vacant pupils in the reflection grow utterly lifeless with Corbin's words.
So, as long as I, the ""sinner"", remained alive in this world, as long as Corbin remained in my life, nothing could ever truly end.
I could only atone for my ""sins"" through death, to break free by dying.
On the way, Corbin called the manager of his family's club and reserved a private room not open to the public.
Hearing his calm, authoritative tone as he made the arrangements suddenly reminded me of the Corbin after our marriage.
In my memory, such a Corbin only emerged after he inherited the family business.
Had he... also been reborn?
The thought made me nervous.
No matter what, I couldn't let Corbin detect anything unusual about me.
If Corbin had indeed been reborn and if the events of the previous life repeated themselves, I would still be the ""sole culprit"" who harmed Melanie in his eyes.
After all... I was the only one who knew Melanie's secret.
In the private room, Melanie shyly picked a love song and invited Corbin to sing a duet with her.
Their classmates started teasing and egging them on.
In their eyes, the noble, polite Corbin and the beautiful, resilient Melanie were destined to be together eventually.
I watched it all calmly, finding the entire birthday celebration tedious and drawn-out.
Suddenly, the door to the room opened, and a woman dressed like a socialite appeared at the entrance.
""Corb?""
It was Corbin's mother.
Dressed in an haute couture suit, she looked commanding. The lively noise in the room ceased abruptly with her arrival.
When her gaze swept over Melanie, who was sitting very close to Corbin, she frowned slightly. But when she looked at me sitting in the corner, her face instantly broke into a smile.
Chapter 5
""Aubrey, I was wondering why my Corb went through so much trouble to reserve this room at the club today. So it was because you wanted to come and have some fun.""
I had no choice but to stand up awkwardly.
""Catherine, actually, it's...""
""It's fine,"" Catherine smiled at me, her eyes full of affection. ""I was supposed to entertain clients here today. I didn't expect Corb to take my room. I thought it was for some cheeky little girl.
""As long as it's you who wants to come, any room in this club is yours.""
As soon as she said this, the atmosphere in the room instantly turned awkward. Corbin looked displeased, while Melanie only managed to maintain her look of embarrassment for a few seconds before restoring her smile.
I wanted to say something more, but Catherine cut me off directly.
""Oh, and Aubrey, remember to come over with your parents this weekend. I've hired a new chef who's especially skilled at making your favorite dishes.""
""I..."" The words stuck in my throat, but I couldn't think of any way to refuse, so I just said stiffly, ""Thank you, Catherine.""
Catherine left satisfied, but I began to feel restless and uneasy.
Fortunately, no one dwelled too much, and before long, the noise and chatter started up again.
Melanie, however, was clearly somewhat dispirited. After a few drinks, she came over, linked arms with me intimately, and complained.
""Aubrey, Corbin gave me a custom-made necklace today. It's too expensive. I tried to refuse, but he said it was just a normal gift.
""What can I do with him? Was he always this 'normal' for your birthdays in the past?""
I paused. The extra seven years finally allowed me to understand Melanie's implication this time.
She was trying to find out if Corbin treated her differently.
I smiled and said, ""No.""
""Really?""
Melanie's eyes instantly held a trace of delight, mixed with a hint of suspicion.
""Aubrey, you seem a bit unhappy today. Is it because... Corbin only gave me a necklace?""
I froze for a moment, suddenly realizing that perhaps the feelings I thought I had hidden so well in my previous life had been noticed by Melanie all along.
""No.""
I quickly took Melanie's hand and spoke sincerely, ""Ms. Calhoun, I'm genuinely happy for you that Corb treats you well. I hope... You both will always be well.""
Amidst the noise, Corbin suddenly glanced in our direction.
Melanie was clearly preparing to confide more in me, but right now, I just wanted to get away from anywhere she and Corbin were. I pretended to have severe stomach cramps and fled the club as if escaping.
***
Away from the place where Corbin was, I felt a sense of relief, and my steps instantly lightened.
I was trying to hail a taxi by the roadside when Corbin appeared out of nowhere behind me.
""Aubrey, didn't you just say... You weren't feeling well?""
I shuddered all over, instantly flustered and stammering, ""I... I started feeling a bit better after I came out.""
Corbin's looming figure was intensely oppressive, his gaze gloomy and probing.
""But Aubrey, I recall that you only started calling her... Ms. Calhoun... after she died.""

**1. Evangelism Begins at Home**

You don’t have to travel across the world to find your mission field.  
Sometimes your greatest gospel opportunity is sitting **at your kitchen table**, in your friend group, or working at the desk next to yours.

The truth is, most people don’t come to Christ through strangers.  
They come because of **someone they know and trust**

* A friend who shared their story
* A coworker who prayed with them during a crisis
* A family member who lived out their faith with integrity
* A spouse who gently loved them toward Christ
* A neighbor who kept showing up with grace

**You are someone’s bridge to Jesus.**  
And that bridge is built through relationship.

**2. The Woman at the Well: A Relational Revival**

One of the most powerful pictures of relational evangelism comes from *John 4*.

Jesus meets a Samaritan woman at a well. She’s broken, isolated, and full of shame. But after a simple, Spirit-led conversation, she experiences truth, grace, and transformation.

She leaves her water jar and runs into town—not to preach a sermon, but to share her story.

>

And what happened?

>

She didn’t quote Scripture. She didn’t have a title. She simply **testified within her own community**—and it led to revival.

**3. The Power of Proximity**

The people you are most connected to are often the ones God has **specifically entrusted to you**.

* Your family
* Your coworkers
* Your classmates
* Your friends
* Your neighbors
* Your online community

Evangelism isn’t just something you *go out to do*—it’s something you *live out where you are*.

God strategically places His people in every neighborhood, school, workplace, and family so that **the gospel can travel through the arteries of relationship.**

>

You are exactly where you are **on purpose**.

**4. How to Use Your Relational Pulpit Well**

You don’t have to force conversations—but you do have to be **intentional**.

Here are simple, Spirit-led ways to steward your relationships for the Kingdom:

* **Be Present**

Don’t be so focused on “big ministry” that you miss the people in front of you.  
Listen. Ask questions. Show up.

* **Be Consistent**

People are more impacted by how you live than by what you say once. Live a life that makes people want to know more about your faith.

>

* **Be Vulnerable**

Let people see the real you. Don’t just share your strengths—share your struggles and how Jesus meets you in them.

* **Be Prayerful**

Ask God for open doors. Pray for the people in your life by name.  
You’ll be amazed how often He creates divine moments when you’re watching.

* **Be Patient**

Sometimes the seed takes time. Don’t give up. Don’t force it.  
Your job is to love, speak when prompted, and trust the Holy Spirit to work.

**5. When It’s Hard with Those Closest to You**

It’s one thing to share your faith with a stranger—it’s another thing to share it with someone who’s known you for years.

* There’s fear: *“What if they reject me?”*
* There’s shame: *“They’ve seen my failures.”*
* There’s fatigue: *“They’ve already said no.”*

But don’t forget—God is patient. He’s still writing their story. And your love, humility, and consistent witness **may be the chapter that turns their heart**.

Even Jesus faced resistance in His hometown (Mark 6:4). But He didn’t stop loving or speaking.

Neither should we.

# Reflection: Who’s in Your Circle?

Who has God placed in your life right now that doesn’t know Jesus?

* Write down 3 names.
* Pray for them daily.
* Look for open doors to love, serve, and speak.
* Trust the Spirit to do the heavy lifting.

You don’t have to change their hearts. You just have to be **faithful** with your voice. Because your relational pulpit—your family, your friends, your world—isn’t small. **It’s sacred.**

>

# XXX) Influence begins in your home, work, and friendships

>

You don’t need a platform to have influence. You already have one. And it starts **right where you are.** Too often, we wait for a bigger opportunity, a bigger following, or a more “official” ministry role. But God’s design is simple:

>

**Your Home**

Your greatest discipleship may happen at your dinner table, not a conference. Whether you’re single, married, parenting, or living with family—your home is holy ground.

* Speak life over your spouse or children
* Model integrity, repentance, and joy
* Let your home be a place where Jesus is known, not just mentioned

>

**Your Workplace**

You don’t clock out of your calling when you clock in to your job.  
Your integrity, work ethic, kindness, and conversations **preach** louder than you think.

* Be the most encouraging voice in the office
* Pray before meetings
* Be available to coworkers in crisis
* Let excellence be your witness

>

**Your Friendships**

Your closest friends know the real you. That’s why **your life and your words carry weight.**

* Don’t hide your faith—share it gently and naturally
* Invite them into your struggles and show how Jesus sustains you
* Ask deep questions and offer truth with love

>

**Final Thought: You’re Already in Ministry**

You don’t need to be a pastor to be a minister.  
If you’re a believer—you’re already called, already placed, and already equipped.

**Your home is your first pulpit.**  
**Your workplace is your mission field.**  
**Your friendships are your opportunity.**

So ask God:

>

Then show up—fully, faithfully, and filled with the Spirit.

Because **ministry doesn’t start when you’re noticed.**  
**It starts when you’re obedient.**

# XXXI) How Jesus used personal conversations to transform lives.

>

Jesus changed the world one conversation at a time. While He taught crowds and challenged religious leaders, His most transformational moments happened not on platforms—but **in personal, Spirit-led encounters**. He didn’t just preach truth. He *spoke it personally*—and the result was heart-level transformation.

Here are just a few life-changing conversations from the Gospels:

**1. The Woman at the Well — John 4**

A Samaritan woman, ashamed and rejected, comes to the well alone.

Jesus meets her there—not with condemnation, but conversation.

* He asks a question.
* He speaks prophetically.
* He reveals Himself as the Messiah.

>

That personal moment led to a village-wide revival.

**2. Zacchaeus the Tax Collector — Luke 19**

Zacchaeus climbs a tree to see Jesus, but Jesus does more than notice him.

>

Jesus goes home with him, speaks privately with him, and by the end of the day, Zacchaeus is **repenting and restored**. One conversation. One invitation. A completely transformed life.

**3. Nicodemus the Religious Leader — John 3**

Nicodemus, curious but cautious, comes to Jesus at night.

Instead of calling him out, Jesus welcomes the conversation—and in that personal setting, He gives us one of the most well-known verses in Scripture:

>

Even religious insiders need one-on-one moments with the truth.

**4. The Blind Man — John 9**

After healing the man born blind, Jesus circles back for a private moment.

>

The man replies, “Who is He?” Jesus says, “You have now seen Him.” A miracle opened his eyes, but a **conversation opened his heart.**

**5. Peter After the Resurrection — John 21**

Peter, ashamed after denying Jesus, goes back to fishing.  
Jesus meets him on the shore—not with public shame, but with a fire and a question:

>

In that quiet, personal exchange, Jesus restores Peter and recommissions him to lead. The man who failed became the man who preached Pentecost—all through a tender conversation with his Savior.

**What These Conversations Teach Us**

Jesus didn’t need a crowd to do ministry. He looked people in the eyes. He met them in their stories. He asked questions, spoke truth, and gave grace.

>

This is the model for us:

* Don’t wait for a microphone—speak to someone over coffee
* Don’t underestimate a Spirit-led question—it might open a heart
* Don’t rush your conversations—**listen, love, and lead gently**

Sometimes, the most powerful evangelism happens **in a single conversation** where someone finally feels seen—and finally sees Jesus.

**Final Thought: One Voice, One Heart, One Savior**

Jesus didn’t just teach in crowds. He *transformed in conversations.*

And He still does—**through you**.

So ask yourself:

>

Because He’s still meeting people at wells, in homes, in private places of pain. And He still uses **willing believers** to bring hope to hurting hearts—one conversation at a time.

# XXXII) Building trust, sowing seeds, and knowing when to speak.

Sharing Jesus isn’t about forcing a moment—it’s about **faithfully walking with people through moments**.

It’s not a one-time transaction. It’s often a **relational journey** of:

1. Building trust
2. Sowing spiritual seeds
3. Listening for the Spirit’s cue to speak truth

Let’s explore each step:

**1. Building Trust: Love First, Speak Later**

Before most people want to hear what you believe, they want to know if you care.

Jesus didn’t lead with doctrine—He led with compassion. He built relational credibility through kindness, presence, and patience.

>

**Trust is the soil where gospel seeds grow.**  
No trust = no traction.

**Practical ways to build trust:**

* Be consistent, not flaky
* Listen without rushing to fix
* Respect boundaries
* Stay when others walk away

Relational evangelism begins with being a **safe and sincere presence** in someone’s life.

**2. Sowing Seeds: Planting Truth Without Pressure**

Once trust is built, we can begin to gently sow truth—through words, actions, and Spirit-led moments.

Seeds are small, but they’re **powerful.**

>

You don’t need to preach a full sermon. You just need to **plant something eternal**:

* A Scripture in a conversation
* A personal testimony in a group text
* A moment of prayer or encouragement
* A simple “I’ve found peace in Jesus—can I share what that means for me?”

Seeds don’t always sprout immediately. But they are never wasted.

**3. Knowing When to Speak: Follow the Spirit, Not the Script**

Discernment is critical in relational evangelism.

Sometimes the door is open—speak with boldness.  
Other times, the door is closed—wait in prayer.

Jesus said:

>

That doesn’t mean people are pigs—it means **not every moment is sacred ground yet.** We must be sensitive to the Holy Spirit's timing.

Ask yourself:

* *Have I earned the right to speak into this part of their life?*
* *Is their heart soft or defensive?*
* *Is the Spirit prompting me to speak—or to wait and keep loving?*

Sometimes silence is obedience. Sometimes speaking is courage. Wisdom knows which is which.

**Final Thought: Be Faithful in Every Stage**

Not everyone will say yes right away.  
Some will take years. Some will say no.  
Your job isn’t to save them—**it’s to steward the moment**.

* Build trust
* Sow truth
* Speak when the Spirit leads

And remember:

>

* So be a faithful friend
* Be a quiet witness
* Be a patient sower

Because the harvest is His—and it’s coming.

Eyüpspor, fresh off a 1-1 draw with Karagumruk that probably involved a lot of hand-wringing and existential dread, heads to Gaziantep Stadium to face a team that’s playing like they’ve hired Zlatan Ibrahimović as their luck charm. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Turkish coffee reader and the humor of a stadium announcer who’s seen it all.

### The Odds: Why Your Grandma Knows to Back Gaziantep

The bookmakers aren’t just throwing darts here—they’re lobbing grenades. Gaziantep is the favorite at **-110 to -120** (decimal: \~1.83-1.87), implying a **53-55% chance to win**. Eyüpspor? They’re the underdog at **+350 to +420**, which means your implied probability of them winning is roughly **21-24%**. The draw? A meager **26-28%**—because nothing says “thrilling climax” like a 0-0 snoozer.

In betting terms, this is like showing up to a boxing match and realizing the heavyweight champion is facing a guy who got his license to punch in a video game.

### Team News: Injuries So Packed, They Could Form Their Own League

**Gaziantep FK**: They’re missing **four players to suspension** (including a midfielder banned for betting—*really*?), **two long-term injured defenders**, and two more who’re “doubts.” It’s like building a house with a toolbox full of hammers and no nails. But hey, their **home form is stellar**: 5 wins in 6 games, and their only loss? A 4-0 drubbing by Fenerbahçe, who play like they’re on a holy mission to make everyone else look bad.

**Eyüpspor**: They’re without **Luccas Claro** (ACL, out for the season—*ouch*) and **Calegari** (muscle injury, out until December). Their defense? A sieve that could pass for a colander at a pasta convention. On the road, they’ve scored \*\*o

Kayserispor, languishing in the relegation zone, is priced at **+360 to +380** (\~3.75), translating to a **27-26% chance**. The draw? A tidy **+350 to +370** (\~3.65), suggesting bookmakers think this match is as predictable as a toddler’s nap schedule.

The key stat? Rizespor’s **2-1-1 home record** (W2, D1, L1) contrasts sharply with Kayserispor’s **0-1-2 away record** (W0, D1, L2) this season. But let’s not forget Rizespor’s defense has leaked **21 goals** in 13 games—like a sieve that’s been dunked in a lake. Meanwhile, Kayserispor’s offense has managed just **9 points** in 13 matches, which is about as effective as a soccer team made of pillows.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Suspensions, and a Dash of Absurdity**  
Rizespor’s woes include **Halil Dervişoğlu** (injured), **Samet Akaydin** (suspended), and **Laçi** (also suspended). Imagine a chef missing their salt, pepper, and the guy who stirs the soup—chaos ensues. But at least their home crowd will be louder than a Turkish coffee pot on a steamroller.

Kayserispor? They’re basically a medical convention. **Ackah Yaw**, **Berkan Aslan**, **Dorukhan Tokoz**, and others are sidelined, plus **five yellow-card suspensions**. It’s like their squad got hit by a rogue physio with a vendetta. And let’s not forget their **zero away wins since April**—a

i was thinking of a cheese/coffee hamper from fortnum and mason? it would work for my £30ish budget and seems like a good quality option in my budget, but i also dont know if it would actually taste any good to someone who actually enjoys coffee/cheese tasting? i thought itd be nice to consider UK cheeses/popular coffees, since its a slightly different palette to europe that could give us something to talk about!

he enjoys whiskey, but he goes to proper whiskey tasting events so i imagine itd probably be better to stay away from this option rather than getting something random

hes a workaholic, works in tech/finances, but takes care of his needs so i cant particularly think of any practical gifts i could get

gift vouchers dont really work here because of their financial background, same goes for a lot of out there experiences.

im aware he enjoys learning history, i love listening to him explaining various historical things, however we're not close enough yet for me to know what aspects/niches he's particularly interested in that could translate into gifts..

a lot of defaults are leather related, but i cant do that either, since the family is pretty 'green' in general and avoid these sorts of products, as do i!

so i remain a bit stuck for ideas.

i am already baking something on the side for the family (they always seem to enjoy fresh goods), and im painting something for my MIL, but my FIL seems more reserved and practical so im not sure something crafty would be the most fitting here.

any suggestions would be very appreciated! hope everyone has a lovely christmas season ahead!
