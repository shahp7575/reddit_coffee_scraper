## Key Features Analysis

Meaningful staff appreciation goes beyond generic corporate gifts. To truly acknowledge and value your team's contributions, consider focusing on presents that are practical, personalized, and aligned with their interests.

**Personalized Gift Boxes:** A curated gift box tailored to an employee's hobbies or interests shows that you've put thought and effort into the present. For example, a coffee lover might appreciate a box filled with artisanal coffee beans, a high-quality mug, and a coffee-themed treat. A fitness enthusiast could receive a box with premium workout gear,protein snacks,and a fitness journal. The key is personalization.

**subscription Services:** Offering a subscription service provides ongoing value and enjoyment. Options range from streaming services to meal kits to monthly book clubs. The beauty of a subscription lies in its consistent reminder of your appreciation and caters to diverse interests, allowing employees to choose the option that best suits them. Different sites offer various plans and options to choose from.

**Experiences:** Rather than physical gifts, consider giving experiences like tickets to a concert, cooking classes, or a spa day. Experiences create lasting memories and offer a break from the daily grind. This can be especially valuable for employees who appreciate leisure and exploration. Experience gifts can be tailored toward individual or group options, fostering team bonding and offering opportunities for relaxation.**High-Quality Tech Gadgets:** In today's technology-driven world, useful gadgets make great gifts. Consider noise-canceling headphones, wireless chargers, or smart home devices. These items not only enhance productivity but also provide convenience and reflect a company's investment in its employees' comfort and well-being. The gadgets should be of a reliably high quality to avoid any negative impact associated with a poorly functioning device.

**Wellness Packages:** Emphasize employee well-being with gifts that promote relaxation and self-care. This could include aromatherapy diffusers, high-end skincare products, or subscriptions to meditation apps. Prioritizing wellness communicates care and support for employees' mental and physical health, which is increasingly valued in the modern workplace. Customization is a key consideration for wellness packages to respect personal preferences and avoid any potential allergens or sensitivities.

**Charitable Donations in Their Name:** If your employees are socially conscious, consider making a donation to a charity of their choice in their name. This allows employees to support causes they care about and demonstrates your company's commitment to social obligation. This is often considered more meaningful than a physical gift by those who value giving back and making a positive impact on the world. It is essential to present this option tastefully, ensuring that it aligns with company values and employee preferences.

## FAQs Section

Selecting the proper ways to show appreciation can be tricky, especially at larger companies or across varying demographics. Here are some commonly asked questions and answers to help.

**How do I determine what types of gifts my staff will appreciate most?**
Consider surveying your staff about their interests, hobbies, and preferences. Anonymous surveys can encourage honest feedback.

Giving personalized gifts based on employee individual needs and preferences demonstrates to the staff that the company cares about them.

Yes, generally, gifts are considered taxable income for employees. There are frequently enough limits to the value of non-cash gifts that can be given without being considered income.Consult with your finance department or a tax professional to ensure compliance with tax regulations. In certain specific cases, de minimis gifts (small, infrequent gifts of nominal value) are exempt from taxation.

**How often should staff appreciation gifts be given?**
there's no one-size-fits-all answer, but staff appreciation should be an ongoing effort, not just limited to holidays or special occasions. Small gestures of appreciation can be given regularly, while more notable gifts can be reserved for milestones or exceptional performance. Regular appreciation, even in small ways, can boost morale and foster a more positive work environment.

**What is the best way to present staff appreciation gifts?**
Presentation matters.Whether it's a physical gift or an experience, take the time to wrap it nicely or present it in a thoughtful way.

I know this is a long shot but.. I'm in my early thirties and have lived in Antwerp for.. probably around 6 years now? However, other than the friends I had prior to moving here (who've all decided to make babies and are therefore available less often) I have really struggled to make/maintain new friendships.

I've often seen people suggesting joining clubs/group meetups but the sad reality is that I'm quite shy and not a huge fan of large groups. Even when I try to get out of my comfort zone and attend these events, I often find that a lot of people already know each other and it's seldom that someone actually makes the effort to include you/make you feel welcome.

I currently work fulltime but in my free time I go to the gym a few times but my true passion (for the past 3 months) is indoor climbing. If anyone would like to join me for this, or just wants to get to know one another (just hang out on weekends, go to the movies, go for a walk, grab a bite/coffee, idk, ..) please feel free to comment down below or send a chat.

Now let’s talk about what comes next to keep your shoot on track and your team (mostly) sane.

* **Scout Smart and Early** Don’t wait until the week before. Start scouting months ahead on platforms like Giggster. Book viewings, talk to owners, and look for potential hiccups—like noise, lighting issues, or that one neighbor who always mows their lawn mid-take.
* **Get the Locals on Your Side** Hiring local talent isn’t just efficient—it’s smart. They know the area, the shortcuts, and sometimes even the mayor. It could also help you qualify for local incentives or speed up permits.
* **Expect Delays, Plan Anyway** Delays happen. (Film crews run on coffee, hope, and backup plans.) Assign clear roles to each department head to help everything from setup to wrap run smoother and avoid the dreaded “hurry up and wait.”
* **Feed People, Win Hearts** Want to keep your crew happy and focused? Feed them well. Snacks and drinks on hand keep energy high, and full meals keep mutiny at bay. No one shoots their best scene hangry.

In short: prep well, build local bridges, and don’t skimp on the snacks. That’s the director’s secret sauce.",2,1749376958.0,GiggsterHQ,0,1.0,False
1l68mej,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l68mej/my_review_of_the_sage_dual_boiler_df54_grinder/,My review of the Sage Dual Boiler + DF54 grinder (spoiler: it's an awesome combo),"Hi all. I have now had the Sage Dual Boiler and DF54 for a couple of months and want to give some thoughts:

Sage Dual Boiler [https://www.sageappliances.com/en-gb/product/bes920](https://www.sageappliances.com/en-gb/product/bes920)

DF54 grinder [https://df64coffee.com/products/df54?variant=45746496602261](https://df64coffee.com/products/df54?variant=45746496602261)

**Background:**

After 5 years of living with a Siemens EQ.6 S700 superauto I knew to was time to up my coffee game and taste. I researched various options and found the dual boiler for a great price of 750 EUR (returned but sold as new with warranty) so that took the sting out of the MSRP. Then I researched the best value grinders and the DF54 was the easy winner. I also bought a Normcore bottomless portafilter, a tamper and a MHW-3BOMBER puck screen. The coffee beans I use are dark roast and usually roasted within 2-4 weeks.

**Sage Dual Boiler espresso machine:**

The Dual Boiler is very simply to operate and heats up relatively quickly. I set a timer for 6am so its already warmed through when I get up, meaning I just need to tun it on and wait 5 mins and its all nice and toasty. To pull shots I use only the manual function, with between 5 and 10 seconds of preinfusion. The machine seems to run at 10 bar, so overshoots from the 9 spec. I may invesigate mods in future to change that but for now I don't really notice the negative impact.

The milk frother is good, not the fastest out of the box I increased steam power via the settings which helped and I can now do 'reasonable' steamed milk which produces great lattes and cappuccinos. I am still far away from latte art though. Also I don't really use the dual boiler capability yet, I think its something I may do more when im more comfortable with the process and can do it on auto-brain.

The machine has a big water tank, a big drip tray and is super easy to clean and has a useful storage compartment under the drip tray. Oh yeah and it also has wheels for easy movement on the countertop. Compared to my superauto it is FAR easier to maintain.

**DF54 grinder:**

This was a clear winner in pretty much every roundup for the best value and best performing grinder in its class. The DF54 grinder is amazing and grinds super fine... I only need it on between 14.5 and 15.5 and it makes fantastic espresso powder. That is right in the middle of the grind scale of the machine so there is a LOT of extra room for grinding finer or coarser depending on your roast. Retention seems very low and the belIlows make it very easy get out the last bits. I am super impressed with it and will be recommending it to anyone who wants a great espresso grinder.

**Summary:**

It's a REALLY great combo for making espresso at under 1000 EUR. it of course took me a couple of weeks to learn the ropes of how to make espresso, but now I can consistently pull great single and double shots that taste as good as or better than the majority of coffee shops or restaurants you will go to. My preference is 9.5g to 19g single shots and 18.5g to 30g double shots, they have a deep and rich taste.

I wholeheartedly recommend this combo to anyone with this budget. :)",1,1749376954.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

**WRITTEN BY:** \[ScottDaMopTwT\]

# ACT ONE: RUNAWAY

**EXT. AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK - EARLY MORNING**

A high-speed TRAIN streaks across the red dust. Inside, the DRIVER blinks heavily, fighting fatigue.

**INT. TRAIN CAB**

The DRIVER’s hand slumps. His body goes limp, hitting the throttle. The train JERKS into overdrive.

**INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE**

PASSENGERS panic. The train accelerates dangerously. Screams echo.

**EXT. SKY ABOVE - CONTINUOUS**

A silver blur — **THUNDERBIRD 1** — streaks overhead. It drops into view.

**INT. THUNDERBIRD 1 COCKPIT**

**SCOTT TRACY** (30s, cool under pressure) locks eyes on the train.

**SCOTT**  
Thunderbird 1 to base. Runaway train, full throttle. Beginning intervention.

He flips switches.

**SCOTT (CONT'D)**  
Grapple arm — deployed. Lining up the shot.

**EXT. TRAIN TRACKS**

TB1 swoops in low, latches a grapple to the engine car. Its thrusters fire — 46% power.

**SCOTT (V.O.)**  
Runway’s open. Time to brake this beast.

**INT. TRAIN**

The PANIC subsides. Passengers gasp in relief as the train slows.

**EXT. TRAIN SITE - MOMENTS LATER**

**THUNDERBIRD 2** descends with a WHOOSH. It lands as TB1 releases the train.

**VIRGIL TRACY** emerges from TB2.

**SCOTT**  
Didn’t need your help after all.

**VIRGIL**  
Mmm. Yeah. Well done, Scott.

**SCOTT**  
F.A.B.

They launch. TB1 and TB2 race back to base. TB2 peels through clouds, showing off.

# ACT TWO: PLUMMETING FROM SPACE

**INT. TRACY ISLAND - CONTROL ROOM**

**JEFF TRACY** debriefs with **GORDON** and **ALAN**. Doors hiss — SCOTT and VIRGIL return.

**SCOTT**  
Train’s parked. Who’s making coffee?

**JOHN (HOLOSCREEN)**  
Incoming alert. UNSA rocket — Valkary MG61. Guidance failure. It’s descending fast. Sydney’s in the drop zone.

**JEFF**  
Scott, Virgil — go. Alan, Thunderbird 3. Gordon, prep Thunderbird 4. Move!

**EXT. TRACY ISLAND - LAUNCH BAY**

Thunderbird 1 rockets out. Thunderbird 2 follows. Then, Thunderbird 3 erupts from its hidden silo.

**INT. TB1 COCKPIT - STRATOSPHERE**

**SCOTT**  
John, status?

**JOHN**  
Rocket descending. You’ve got three minutes.

**SCOTT**  
Plenty of time to do something insane.

**VIRGIL (COMMS)**  
Don't you dare.

**SCOTT**  
Already dared.

TB1 shifts to horizontal flight, engines blazing.

**INT. THUNDERBIRD 1 - AIRSPACE ABOVE SYDNEY**

Scott locks onto the falling rocket.

**SCOTT**  
I’m going to nudge it off-course.

**VIRGIL (COMMS)**  
Scott, that's suicide. You’ll shear right off it.

**SCOTT**  
We don’t have time to argue!

He cuts Virgil's comm feed.

**GORDON (V.O.)**  
Uh… did he just shut us off?

**EXT. SKY ABOVE SYDNEY**

TB1 CLIPS the falling rocket.

**SCOTT (CONT’D)**  
Come on... come on...!

The rocket YAWNS sideways. It SPLASHES into the sea.

**SCOTT (V.O.)**  
Sydney’s safe. Barely.

# ACT THREE: ORBITAL DRIFT

**INT. TB3 - SPACE**

**ALAN** pilots toward the I.W.S.S.P. station.

**ALAN**  
Station in sight. Stabilizing arms deployed.

**JOHN (COMMS)**  
Be gentle — it’s spinning like a disco ball.

Alan latches TB3’s arms around the station. The spin slows.

**ALAN**  
And... gotcha. Bringing her back.

# ACT FOUR: THE SEA GRAB

**EXT. OCEAN SITE - LATER**

**TB2** hovers. **TB1** is back. **TB4** SPLASHES into the water.

**GORDON (V.O.)**  
Going deep. Locating the rocket.

**INT. TB4 - UNDERWATER**

**GORDON** finds it — wedged in a reef.

**GORDON (CONT’D)**  
Locked on. It’s stuck hard.

**EXT. OCEAN SURFACE**

**TB1** grapples the wreck. It starts lifting... until its engines STRAIN. Alarms BLARE.

**SCOTT**  
Okay this... this was dumb.

**TB1** is pulled down, its nose inches from the surface.

**SCOTT (CONT’D)**  
Uh, Virgil? Buddy?

**VIRGIL (COMMS)**  
On it.

**TB2** fires *both* grapples. It yanks the rocket free. TB1 disengages.

**SCOTT**  
Thanks. Let’s never speak of this again.

**VIRGIL**  
Already forgotten.

# ACT FIVE: A STORM BREWS

**EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER**

TB2 delivers the rocket. NASA techs wave in gratitude.

**NASA CHIEF**  
IRO — you saved lives today.

**SCOTT**  
Just doing what we do.

**INT. TRACY ISLAND - NIGHT**

The family relaxes. Laughter. A calm moment.

**JOHN (ALERT)**  
Everyone — screen. Now.

Monitors flicker. The HOOD appears — masked, menacing.

**THE HOOD**  
You’ve had your fun, Tracy family. But now, the world is mine to control. All networks — mine. Every plane, every satellite. And your secrets? Exposed.

**JEFF**  
Everyone to stations. This just became war.

**SCOTT**  
Guess nap time’s over.

**GORDON**  
I hadn’t even taken off my flippers

What really caught my attention is their €250 million share buyback, not just the size of it, but the fact that they almost paused it recently because the share price was rising too quickly. That’s not something you hear every day. When management pulls back on a buyback program because they think the stock is getting too expensive too fast, it tells you they believe intrinsic value is well above current levels. It’s like a soft floor under the stock, set by the company itself.

Then there’s pricing power. Most consumer goods companies have been struggling with inflation, but JDE Peet’s seems to be holding margins far better than peers. They’ve been able to push through price increases without major volume losses and in some cases, retailers are the ones absorbing the increases just to keep these brands on the shelves (Dutch retailers like Albert Heijn).That says a lot about the strength of their portfolio and their negotiating power in the value chain.

Fundamentally, this is a cash machine. Free cash flow keeps growing year over year. They run lean operations, keep capex in check, and deploy their cash well: dividends, deleveraging, and share repurchases. The FCF yield is in the 8–10% range, which is exceptional for a consumer staple with this level of global reach. And yet, the stock is still trading below its IPO price of €31.50 a level that was already considered cautious when they went public in 2020.

Now here’s where it gets even more interesting: JAB Holding. They own the majority of JDE Peet’s and recently bought out Mondelez’s 26.5% stake. At the same time, they freed up cash by selling part of their Keurig Dr Pepper stake. Put those together: the increased control, the available capital, and the deeply undervalued share price and it starts to look like a textbook setup for a take-private scenario. JAB has done this before with other consumer brands, and the conditions look right for it to happen again.

So you’ve got a company with strong fundamentals, pricing power, high and growing free cash flow, aggressive buybacks, and a majority owner who’s consolidating control — all while the market barely notices. It feels like the downside is limited, and the upside could come either from a re-rating or a strategic move like a buyout.

I’m making this post because I have been broken to my core seeing/dating a man double my age that lied to me from day 1. (He says “it wasnt the right time to tell the truth! 🤔) He created all the mess we been through and blames me for my reactions. Like him lying to me about his age (said he was 32 when he was 51) kids (said he had none turned out he has 4 ALL CLOSE TO MY AGE), and about his relationship status (TOLD ME HE WAS SINGLE I FIND OUT HE HAS A LONG DISTANCE BF OF 3 YEARS BEFORE ME IN DUBAI)! I’ll just jump right into it…

Last year 1 quarter if the year I met a really nice guy on Tindr. We were supposed to meet at a coffee shop but ended up meeting at my place for the first time. When I met him he sold me dreams. Told me things he thought id want to hear instead of THE TRUTH! A month after almost all good times he broke me for the first time and told me the truth abt the kids, his age, and his boyfriend. He didn’t want to take accountability for his actions, instead he made excuses on why he LIED, like  that he isnt publicly out and doesnt tell people his business when he meets them! (Which i dont get cause why sell people fake versions of you instead of being honest and embracing who you are and aharing thag with people without fear!) He then told me give him time hed work on it. A month and a half goes by. Me being patient not stressing it bring genuine, my friends came to me and asked me what was going on because they originally found out the bf in dubais information for me (Yes im a computer geek 🤣) and told me that if they needed they will find the other halfs information so I can tell him whats going on because they thought from the time I told them abt the lies that the guy I was with was playing me. Well they knew.. 😞 Anywho. A month and a half after the first round of lisd being corrected, i was out eating dinner with him and his friends, and he got up to go to the restroom and left his phone. Well he got a grindr/tindr notification and me and another one of his friends saw it. I wont say names as he may see this, but I cherish him for being there during h the moment. He guided me how to handle the situation. So i gave it time and 2 weeks later the same thing happened again! So when we got to my BF’s house I addressed it. COMES TO FIND OUT HE WAS ON THERE TEXTING GUYS AND SENDING GUYS PICTURES OF HIMSELF NAKED, TALKING NASTY TO THEM, ETC! I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he claimed he didnt meet anyone and I didnt wsnt to search deeper and prove that because I truly loved this man and wanted to see past it. Hoping hed see how much we been through, how much he’s put me through and step up like he hasnt before. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and made him delete the accs and the apps. Then he stepped out of line because I always was talkative abt how I felt. He always made me feel like he wssnt listening or didnt care when I spoke and as i poured my headt out abt what he had done to me since day 1 and when will it end he reverse carded just as he did every situation. Even him lying to me, him having a bf and trying to aay i was his bf. Etc. Well I got up to my wits and I told the BF in dubai. Called him and texted him personally with the info provided from my efriends and HE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT ME OR ANYTHING GOING ON! My now EX WAS LYING TELLING ME HE WAS HANDLING IT! At this point I cracked and exposed the truth abt him to his bf, and his friends that he INTRODUCED ME TO KNOWING HE WAS DOING ALL THESE THINGS! I also told his kids, but blocked them for his good before they could see it. Its like he wanted to set everything hp perfectly for me to believe a happy go life, that wasnt the reality of him stringing me aling, lying, playing games. 

I blocked him and moved on, but ended up going back because my heart is so pure, caring, and loving. When I decide to love someone I’m there 100% chasing everything I need to make us as best as possible! After I went back. It was just me returning to the same old. He lied abt his bf saying it was just business now and they weren’t together. He had blocked me on instagram cause his friends told him I contacted them, and he was still hiding the boyfriend and I from each other now that we had direct contact he couldnt let the bf see he was following me. It all makes since now I didnt add up. During the time me and him spent away I did try replacing the heartache. And Iatched and started talking tk a guy that works in the same field as my now ex. As I was telling him on tindr abt my ex and what he did he ask “Is the person youre talking aboht *my exs first and last name* bye chance” and yep. Turns out they knew each other and the guy ran to my ex NOT KNOWING HE IS NOT AS GOOD ON THE INSIDE AS HE DEPICTS TO EVERYONE ON THE OUTSIDE. NOT KNOWING I WAS BEING TOTALLY HONEST ABT WHAT MY EX HAD DONE TO ME! So when we got back together he told me that the guy told him. Its like he has everyone fooled that he is suck a great moralist person when he is lying, deceiving, and manipulative! 
After us getting back together I could see that he knew I was on to him heavily. Another thing to throw out there is I was never sexually prioritized. He lied to me and told me he was a bottom and was not. He didnt know how to bottom and I even brought him the supplies like a douche to do so and HE NEVER USED IT IN A YESR OF US DATING! NOT ONCE! He always wanted me to FUCK HIM WITHOUT HIM PREPARING AND I NEVER COULD CAUSE IT WAS GROSS OR I JUST COULDNT THINK OF WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. Everytime except once it was a mess. Once I got to enjoy him in a year. He turned me into the bottom instead. I did all the sexual work while he just enjoyed EVERYTIME with hopes of me climaxing and getting a joyful moment in the back of my head 24/7 even when we had sex. 90% of the time after hed cum hes be “tired, his mouth would hurt”, or hed clean up and just roll over and sleep like im not even there. Notice only times I got to spend with him throughout this whole relationship was at night at his places, or if he wanted to go out to eat somewhere. The only time we did something outside of those things like movies, shopping together it, was my doing. Well. I wont go too much into detail, but last week he got angry because I was at his places at the gate and he was out asking me to go there and wait for him. I called him 7 times in the gate and 1 time from my phone and he didnt answer so I came back to the only side of the city that feels safe and was going to eat and sleep. He raised his tone via text and told me i didnt make sense and I was making mysterious visits around the city like I WAS CHEATING ON HIM! HE LITERALLY ACCUSED ME OF CHEATING! So I told him how I felt disrespected, because I was there and wsited for him to open the gate he didnt snd turned it on me as usual. After a gew days for the first time he admitted his anger and wrongs! Took accountability! And we got back on regular terms. Well not even a week later. Yesterday he got mad at me because I always would text him. I would chase for his attention, but i stopped doing so with the way he treated me and I was on my last straw. I wanted to se ehow much he cared if I showed him I was pulling away. notice EVERY SINGLE DAY ID TEXT HIM AND HE WOULD ONLY RESPOND 1/2 TIMES TO 10 TEXTS AND SAY HE WAS ALWAYS BUSY TO RESPOND! Well The 1 day I didnt send him a text, he text me saying “helllooooooo” because i didnt text him all day. He admited i didnt think anything of it and I said “whats up” he then sent me “???” ANOTHER DISRESPECTFUL MEASURE TRYING TO CHECK ME BECAUSE HE DIDNT LIKE THAT I SAID WHATS UP TO HIM! Instead of him addressing the whats up and saying how it made him felt so we could move past it, he got angry and sent “???” So I responded whats up? Whats going on? Because I WAS TRULY LOST ABT THE ATTITUDE! He didnt respond so I called out exactly what was going on. AND HE THEN REVERTS BACK TO HIS OLD WAYS AND BLAMES ME FOR EVERYTHING BECAUSE I SAID WHATS UP TO HIM! LIKE IS THAT NOT ENGLISH YALL?!?!?!? 😫☹️ He said he just sent the “???” Just to send them they are just question marks instead of admitting that he was upset i didnt text him all day and i said whats up. 

Well. This was my breaking point. Im done and cant anyling I told him to have my things and he literally sat them outside his door and told me. Didnt even want to talk to me abt it just sat my stuff outside. When i got there i forced him to talk to me and after hearing him say the things he did after I told him he was immature and starting drama all the time. Notice he claimed this whole relationship I was the drama, stress, problems, everything when I didnt do anything to him. I was honest abt things I didnt even have to tell him cause he never asked. Things that could ruin my life if he told his son thats a CONSTABLE! I still told him because I LOVED HIM AND DIDNT WANT TO HIDE ANY PIECE OR PART OF ME FROM HIM! I was giving him me and letting him decide he I was the guy for him or not. After I told him I was done I got my things and left. Next morning he texts me trying to blame me again for everything, put me down, etc and says “You need to settle down and stop making little simple things a  dilemma!  In the most unexpected opportunity, you jump!  This is YOUR problem. And you will have this issue with anyone.  Remember this for the rest of your life!) as if i didnt already tell him I was done. He thinks its a game and I will no longer let him pkay games with me so I showed him a side of me he hasnt seen AND TOLD HIM THE BIGGEST THING OF ALL! Before I lost my cool i responded respectfully telling him again reminding him that i was done and he responded “I’m done!  Be happy!  Don’t have time for this.  Enjoy your life” as usual trying to play the reverse card as if I didnt already tell him I was done many times. He thinks he cant try and get an upper hand like hes walking away from me! SO I EXPOSED THE TRUTH TO HIM THAT I SAW THE TEXTS IN HIS PHONE WITH HIS STILL CURRENT LING DISTANCE BF IN DUBAI AND I WILL EXPOSE THE TRUTH TO HIM IF HE SENDS ME ANOTHER TEXT ANOTHER I TOLD HIM LEAVE ME ALONE! 

(YES YOU GUYS I HAVE SCREENSHOTS FROM MY EXS PHONE OF HIM AND THE GUY HE TOLD HE HE WAS NO LONGER DATING! ☹️ LYING TO HIM TELLING HIM HE HASNT SEEN ME IN FOREVER…. HE HAD NO IDEA I HAVE KNOWN THE TRUTH ABT HIS STILL BOYFRIEND FOR SO LONG NOW! I JUST BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TO TELL ME THE TRUTH AND TAKE ME AS HIS SOLELY BUT I WAS A FOOL! I WAS PATIENT EVEN AFTER SEEING HE WAS LYING TO ME AND THE OTHER GUY BOTH AND DIDNT CAUSE DISTRUSTION! I WONT GO ON!) 

Guys I really need your insight. Im not crazy right man. ☹️😞😒 This dude has driven me to my wits where I am now enlisting in the army to get away from this place, all the feelings he gave me, and all the bad connections here! I drove myself To the point where i feel like I let someone turn me insane and manipulate me! I never thought it could have ever been me to be head over heels for someone thats a beauty on the inside but a mess on the inside. I wont even proof resd it ill let it be authentic just… Please guys… tell me im not wrong. Tell me exactly the kind of man he is. To me he is a MANIPULATOR, LIAR, CHEATER, AND UNMORALISTIC! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🧎🏽‍➡️, but I understand if you guys differ.

1l68jep,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l68jep/i_might_have_ruined_the_relationship_between_me/,I might have ruined the relationship between me and my brother forever.,"I genuinely don’t know what to do here. I told my friends about this situation, and some of them think I’ve essentially put a nail in the coffin of the relationship between me (24F) and my brother (21M).

For context: my brother and I were super close as kids because our parents were always working and fighting. We’ve never had a family vacation where it was just the four of us; there’s always been an extra aunt or family friends or work (they work in high-demand jobs). And when we do spend time together, we almost always end up fighting.

As a result, my brother and I grew distant. My parents were very harsh on me and spoiled him, which led to me resenting him and often taking out my anger on him. He’s also very spoiled and indifferent, to the point that when our parents sent him to boarding school after he got into the wrong crowd at age 13, he only called family once a month.

I totally get it. I’ve been disconnected from our family too, since our parents are... interesting, to say the least. But when I moved away to another city for uni, things got better. I thought our relationship would improve when he came to my city for uni (at a different school), but that didn’t happen.

He’s messy and expects everyone to clean up after him. He’s rude, inconsiderate, and never calls our parents—though they buy him anything he wants, even though he doesn’t do much to deserve it. This made me really frustrated with him.

Being the youngest, he’s coddled by the rest of the family, which means I’m always picking up after him. He doesn’t care to make an effort to change or even acknowledge how obstructive and messy he is. This has led me to have very little patience with him, and I end up shouting at him over the smallest things, which understandably has led him to resent me.

I’ve apologized and am trying to improve, but when I make an effort to hang out with him or show interest in his hobbies, he just takes me for granted. Every little thing I do seems expected, with no real gratitude. For example, I always pay when we hang out since I’ve had a part-time job during uni, while he focuses on his exams. But when I asked him to buy me a coffee, he asked why I expected it for free. I was floored.

Then, when I gave him a spare toothbrush (since he’d forgotten his at his dorm), he didn’t even throw the packaging in the bin, which was literally right next to the sink. The next day, he used a new toilet paper roll and left the old one in the holder, instead of throwing it away like he should have. I got mad and yelled at him, but I realized it was my fault for reacting that way. Still, I told him it wasn’t fair that he expects me to pick up after him. His response was that it was “just five seconds of work” and not a big deal. When I asked why he didn’t do it himself if it was so easy, he claimed he didn’t notice the bin, despite having lived at my aunt’s house for months before.

I felt bad since he had exams, so I made him breakfast and tea, but he didn’t even thank me. I apologized, and all he did was grunt. That was when I realized that he didn’t care about me at all. He didn’t want to visit me when I was sick, didn’t want to get me a coffee even though our parents give him plenty of money for fun, and just didn’t appreciate anything I did for him.

At that point, I decided I was done putting effort into our relationship. I would remain cordial and help when needed, but I’d draw very strict boundaries.

Here’s what I texted him:

""Hey buddy, good luck with your exams. I’m sorry for today, but I’m genuinely disappointed about our relationship. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a genuine ‘thanks’ or felt any real appreciation from you. I’ve been giving and giving, but I’ve never seen you go out of your way to genuinely be there for anyone in the family. From here on out, I’ll be there for emergencies only. If you need anything else, you can ask Mom and Dad. I’m pretty much done. I know they tell us to take care of each other, but there’s been no ‘us’ in our relationship. Good luck. x""

He replied:

""You sure? I still love you like I always have. Again, it is because of you I am who I am today. Sorry I haven’t given you anything, but I don’t have anything to give. I don’t have the motivation to go out of my way for anyone, even friends. That’s one of my negatives, but it’s not a prejudice. I wanted to say sorry today, but I felt awkward, don’t know why. Our relationship isn’t best friend worthy, but that doesn’t change anything. I know you’re having a harder time than me, and I suck at realizing it. Honestly, I almost cried reading your message. I had to reread it to make sure I wasn’t misunderstanding. I want to give you things, but I don’t know how. I’ve been desensitized towards family ever since hostel. But that doesn’t change how I feel. Yes, our interactions are different now, but I’ve thought about it. When we were younger, I always thought things would stay like they were between us, but I didn’t question it. I want to be there for you because I want to, but I don’t know how. Please forgive me.""

Reading his message broke my heart. It reminded me of the sweet, little boy who was once my entire world. But then I thought of all the times I’d called him daily to check up on him, only for him to ignore my calls. Or for his birthday, when I wanted to bake him something nice and get him the gift he wanted, but he left our family dinner early to hang out with friends, and didn’t even thank me when I paid for his food.

I then responded with:

""Thanks for your message, \[brother\]. I totally understand where you’re coming from, and I appreciate your honesty. You have no idea how much it means to me, and I really do appreciate it. I get what you’re saying, especially since family hasn’t been close for us. We rarely spend time together, and when we do, it feels like we’re always fighting or too busy with work. But I had hoped that our relationship would be different, especially since we had to look out for each other from a young age. I don’t need anything material, but I still feel a huge lack of genuine attention from you. I know you don’t fully get it, but I wasn’t born knowing all this either. I’ve tried communicating with you before, but I’ve only received indifference. I appreciate your gratitude, and I’m grateful for you too. There’s nothing to forgive. You’re right—this is the extent of our relationship, and we are who we are. Thanks, \[brother\]. Don’t worry about this. Just focus on eating well and taking care of yourself for your exams. You’ll do well. If you need support or help, I’ll always be here if you reach out.""

Now, I’m done. I can’t keep looking out for everyone else while no one checks in on me.

I told my friend, and she said I should be the bigger person and try to mend things after my exams, since he said he wants to try. But I really don’t have the energy to do that. My parents think it’s my responsibility because I’m the older one and we’re far from them. They say I need to make an effort. When I got a third opinion, they said I was the asshole because he’s just a kid and doesn’t understand the world, so what I did was selfish and damaging to his self-esteem.

tldr: i set a boundary that i thought i needed to with my brother and now his response is wrenching my heart and I don't know what to do.

I’m so conflicted because his message broke my heart, reminding me of the sweet little boy who used to mean the world to me. But I’m just so done. Did I ruin our relationship by trying to set a boundary? I'm so confused.",2,1749376644.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

I posted my dilemma recently, albeit it was a different question. Also, sorry for the wordy post. For any context, feel free to read through my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1kj1pf7/i_21f_dont_know_if_i_should_reach_out_to_my/). However, if you don't want to read it, I don't blame you as it's also very wordy. Here's the condensed version:

I've known my friend, S \[25F\] and her boyfriend R \[29F\] for a long time. Almost three years ago, when I was 19, I found out that R was a creepy guy by way of him admitting ""feelings"" for me despite him having a significant other and the 8-year age gap between us. I found out later that S also knew this and she also had found out that R had every single photo of me that S had ever taken on his personal desktop in a folder (nothing explicit, just regular photos), and despite this fact she still stayed together with him. They would eventually break up about 4-5 months after he admitted his ""feelings"" for me, because he cheated on her with another woman. I found out recently via a social media post that she had gotten back together with him, so I asked Reddit whether I should reach out and see if she's doing okay. This leads to the present.

I did end up reaching out to her and setting up a date for us to talk at a local coffee shop. We sat down and it began with small talk. I tried to politely and gently ask how her dating life was, and she proclaimed it was ""dead"", which I found odd since a recent post had told me otherwise. We continued to talk, and eventually she would ask me directly ""Why am I here?""

I was a little caught off-guard, but since we hadn't talked in about a year and a half, it was a reasonable question to ask. I was a little flustered and wasn't sure how to broach the subject, but I figured we had been making small talk for long enough, I might as well not beat around the bush anymore. I told her that I had seen a post about how she had mentioned a boyfriend, and asked bluntly whether she was dating R again. She said yes. I asked how the relationship was going, and she said it was fine. I asked if he had gotten any professional help. She said that he was in a better place, which told me that he hadn't. 

I tried to express to her that I just wanted to sit down with her truly just to see if she was doing okay. It was extremely awkward after that, and soon after we went our separate ways. 

Here's where I might have been stepping over a boundary. I understand that people can change, and things happen and people go through things. However, R did not do good things. S told me before she broke up with him that he had a propensity for targeting young women with self-esteem issues and trying to take advantage of them, and that he had tried to do this to me. He had done this before to two other girls. 

After my conversation with S, I couldn't get it out of my head. I felt like I had to say something to her, so I sent her this message:

""hey i just wanted to apologize if i made things awkward the other day. i just wanted to see how you were doing and make sure everything was okay. obviously you don't/didn't have to tell me anything, i'm not your mom lol. i also wanted to say, i'm glad you guys are in a better place and that you're doing okay, but i hope that you're careful. its great that he's in a better place, but its not always going to be like that. he has displayed extremely predatory behavior in the past not only to me, but to you and other people, and that kind of thing doesn’t just go away. not to mention he treated you terribly. i understand that relationships have their ups and downs, and that going from a long-term relationship to single is not fun, but i am genuinely concerned about where your relationship with him will go. i'm afraid that sending you this will step over a boundary, and its okay if you don't respond or just ignore this, but i feel like i have to say something, because i don't know if anyone else will. maybe i am misconstruing things, or maybe he has gotten serious help within the last year, or he’s had a miraculous change happen in his life. i would prefer that i am wrong in this situation, but as your friend, i believe he is only going to cause you more damage in the future with his previously displayed behavior. i am going to leave it at that, i guess, because I don't really know what else to say. I hope things work out for you. If you need to talk or if you want help or anything ill be around. bye.""

She didn't respond, but I sent it over Snapchat, so I can see she's opened it at least. I didn't really expect her to respond, so I let it go after that.

However, yesterday I dropped my phone, and I accidentally opened Messenger. I NEVER check Messenger, however when I picked up my phone I saw a few chat messages I hadn't read, with one of them being from R. I had him blocked on everything, but I had only recently made a Facebook, and I hadn't even thought about trying to find him and block him. When I saw that I had a chat request from him, I felt like I was having an out of body experience. My experience with him when he had admitted his feelings to me, and when I had found out he had photos of me on his PC emotionally scarred me. I had nightmares about him for a long time after that, so seeing his name on my phone screen after so long was truly a strange ordeal. His message wasn't comprised of much, he just called me a terrible person for reopening old wounds and told me to stay away for good this time. I screenshotted it immediately and after debating it for a while, I sent it to S, because I believed she should see it.

Now here's my question/questions. Am I doing the wrong thing? Have I taken this too far? Should I butt out of a relationship that's not mine? I know I'm not a terrible person, at least I don't think I am, but maybe me reaching out and being so nosey is hurting my friend, which was/is not at all my intention.

I've been digging into JDE Peet’s (JDEP.AS) lately, and honestly, the more I look, the more it feels like one of those classic value cases hiding in plain sight. For those who don’t know it: JDE Peet’s is the largest pure-play coffee and tea company in the world, with brands like Douwe Egberts, L’OR, Jacobs, and Senseo. They operate in over 100 countries, have serious scale, and yet the stock is flying completely under the radar.

What really caught my attention is their €250 million share buyback, not just the size of it, but the fact that they almost paused it recently because the share price was rising too quickly. That’s not something you hear every day. When management pulls back on a buyback program because they think the stock is getting too expensive too fast, it tells you they believe intrinsic value is well above current levels. It’s like a soft floor under the stock, set by the company itself.

Then there’s pricing power. Most consumer goods companies have been struggling with inflation, but JDE Peet’s seems to be holding margins far better than peers. They’ve been able to push through price increases without major volume losses and in some cases, retailers are the ones absorbing the increases just to keep these brands on the shelves (Dutch retailers like Albert Heijn).That says a lot about the strength of their portfolio and their negotiating power in the value chain.

Fundamentally, this is a cash machine. Free cash flow keeps growing year over year. They run lean operations, keep capex in check, and deploy their cash well: dividends, deleveraging, and share repurchases. The FCF yield is in the 8–10% range, which is exceptional for a consumer staple with this level of global reach. And yet, the stock is still trading below its IPO price of €31.50 a level that was already considered cautious when they went public in 2020.

Now here’s where it gets even more interesting: JAB Holding. They own the majority of JDE Peet’s and recently bought out Mondelez’s 26.5% stake. At the same time, they freed up cash by selling part of their Keurig Dr Pepper stake. Put those together: the increased control, the available capital, and the deeply undervalued share price and it starts to look like a textbook setup for a take-private scenario. JAB has done this before with other consumer brands, and the conditions look right for it to happen again.

So you’ve got a company with strong fundamentals, pricing power, high and growing free cash flow, aggressive buybacks, and a majority owner who’s consolidating control — all while the market barely notices. It feels like the downside is limited, and the upside could come either from a re-rating or a strategic move like a buyout.

32% of my portfolio is allocated into this stock and I have also written some puts with a strike price of €22 when the price was €18,50. cost average is 18,48 per share.

1l687z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l687z4/i_might_have_ruined_the_relationship_between_me/,I might have ruined the relationship between me and my brother forever.,"I genuinely don’t know what to do here. I told my friends about this situation, and some of them think I’ve essentially put a nail in the coffin of the relationship between me (24F) and my brother (21M).

For context: my brother and I were super close as kids because our parents were always working and fighting. We’ve never had a family vacation where it was just the four of us; there’s always been an extra aunt or family friends or work (they work in high-demand jobs). And when we do spend time together, we almost always end up fighting.

As a result, my brother and I grew distant. My parents were very harsh on me and spoiled him, which led to me resenting him and often taking out my anger on him. He’s also very spoiled and indifferent, to the point that when our parents sent him to boarding school after he got into the wrong crowd at age 13, he only called family once a month.

I totally get it. I’ve been disconnected from our family too, since our parents are... interesting, to say the least. But when I moved away to another city for uni, things got better. I thought our relationship would improve when he came to my city for uni (at a different school), but that didn’t happen.

He’s messy and expects everyone to clean up after him. He’s rude, inconsiderate, and never calls our parents—though they buy him anything he wants, even though he doesn’t do much to deserve it. This made me really frustrated with him.

Being the youngest, he’s coddled by the rest of the family, which means I’m always picking up after him. He doesn’t care to make an effort to change or even acknowledge how obstructive and messy he is. This has led me to have very little patience with him, and I end up shouting at him over the smallest things, which understandably has led him to resent me.

I’ve apologized and am trying to improve, but when I make an effort to hang out with him or show interest in his hobbies, he just takes me for granted. Every little thing I do seems expected, with no real gratitude. For example, I always pay when we hang out since I’ve had a part-time job during uni, while he focuses on his exams. But when I asked him to buy me a coffee, he asked why I expected it for free. I was floored.

Then, when I gave him a spare toothbrush (since he’d forgotten his at his dorm), he didn’t even throw the packaging in the bin, which was literally right next to the sink. The next day, he used a new toilet paper roll and left the old one in the holder, instead of throwing it away like he should have. I got mad and yelled at him, but I realized it was my fault for reacting that way. Still, I told him it wasn’t fair that he expects me to pick up after him. His response was that it was “just five seconds of work” and not a big deal. When I asked why he didn’t do it himself if it was so easy, he claimed he didn’t notice the bin, despite having lived at my aunt’s house for months before.

I felt bad since he had exams, so I made him breakfast and tea, but he didn’t even thank me. I apologized, and all he did was grunt. That was when I realized that he didn’t care about me at all. He didn’t want to visit me when I was sick, didn’t want to get me a coffee even though our parents give him plenty of money for fun, and just didn’t appreciate anything I did for him.

At that point, I decided I was done putting effort into our relationship. I would remain cordial and help when needed, but I’d draw very strict boundaries.

Here’s what I texted him:

""Hey buddy, good luck with your exams. I’m sorry for today, but I’m genuinely disappointed about our relationship. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a genuine ‘thanks’ or felt any real appreciation from you. I’ve been giving and giving, but I’ve never seen you go out of your way to genuinely be there for anyone in the family. From here on out, I’ll be there for emergencies only. If you need anything else, you can ask Mom and Dad. I’m pretty much done. I know they tell us to take care of each other, but there’s been no ‘us’ in our relationship. Good luck. x""

He replied:

""You sure? I still love you like I always have. Again, it is because of you I am who I am today. Sorry I haven’t given you anything, but I don’t have anything to give. I don’t have the motivation to go out of my way for anyone, even friends. That’s one of my negatives, but it’s not a prejudice. I wanted to say sorry today, but I felt awkward, don’t know why. Our relationship isn’t best friend worthy, but that doesn’t change anything. I know you’re having a harder time than me, and I suck at realizing it. Honestly, I almost cried reading your message. I had to reread it to make sure I wasn’t misunderstanding. I want to give you things, but I don’t know how. I’ve been desensitized towards family ever since hostel. But that doesn’t change how I feel. Yes, our interactions are different now, but I’ve thought about it. When we were younger, I always thought things would stay like they were between us, but I didn’t question it. I want to be there for you because I want to, but I don’t know how. Please forgive me.""

Reading his message broke my heart. It reminded me of the sweet, little boy who was once my entire world. But then I thought of all the times I’d called him daily to check up on him, only for him to ignore my calls. Or for his birthday, when I wanted to bake him something nice and get him the gift he wanted, but he left our family dinner early to hang out with friends, and didn’t even thank me when I paid for his food.

I then responded with:

""Thanks for your message, \[brother\]. I totally understand where you’re coming from, and I appreciate your honesty. You have no idea how much it means to me, and I really do appreciate it. I get what you’re saying, especially since family hasn’t been close for us. We rarely spend time together, and when we do, it feels like we’re always fighting or too busy with work. But I had hoped that our relationship would be different, especially since we had to look out for each other from a young age. I don’t need anything material, but I still feel a huge lack of genuine attention from you. I know you don’t fully get it, but I wasn’t born knowing all this either. I’ve tried communicating with you before, but I’ve only received indifference. I appreciate your gratitude, and I’m grateful for you too. There’s nothing to forgive. You’re right—this is the extent of our relationship, and we are who we are. Thanks, \[brother\]. Don’t worry about this. Just focus on eating well and taking care of yourself for your exams. You’ll do well. If you need support or help, I’ll always be here if you reach out.""

Now, I’m done. I can’t keep looking out for everyone else while no one checks in on me.

I told my friend, and she said I should be the bigger person and try to mend things after my exams, since he said he wants to try. But I really don’t have the energy to do that. My parents think it’s my responsibility because I’m the older one and we’re far from them. They say I need to make an effort. When I got a third opinion, they said I was the asshole because he’s just a kid and doesn’t understand the world, so what I did was selfish and damaging to his self-esteem.

I’m so conflicted because his message broke my heart, reminding me of the sweet little boy who used to mean the world to me. But I’m just so done. Did I ruin our relationship by trying to set a boundary? I'm so confused.",2,1749375284.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Emotionally available, caffeine-fuelled, and occasionally inappropriate (in the best way). I’m looking to meet someone who’s open to a real connection — flirty, thoughtful, maybe a little indulgent — that doesn’t need to fit a template to be meaningful.

I’m not here to escape my life — it’s beautifully chaotic and deeply lived. I’ve got a pre-teen who keeps me on my toes, a wild job that I love, and a chosen family that fills my heart. My cavoodle is usually curled up at my feet while I wing it through life with quick wit, offerings to old gods, and not nearly enough sleep. I sit pretty comfortably in the world of non-traditional relationships — and have a few that make life richer, not messier.

I swing between philosophical rabbit holes, ridiculous memes, and late-night confessionals. I love voice chats, long conversations that stretch between desire and depth, and connections that feel curious, present, and a little bit bold.

If you’re poly or ENM — and open to something grounded in honesty, attraction, and emotional availability — let’s talk. I’m not looking for perfection. Just presence.

Open to online, voice-based, or in-person connection over time — whatever grows naturally. Mostly around in the evenings AEST, but if we click, I’ll make time.

I’ve got a soft spot for a good voice — especially when paired with emotional presence and the kind of wit that makes me laugh out loud. If you’ve got an accent I’ll want to lean into (Irish, Scottish, or just sexy-in-your-own-way), you’ve already got my attention.

Flirty banter? Yes please.

We tried their basic matcha drink first, para we can really judge if it’s legit and yep, it was really good! They’re definitely using high-quality matcha, not the usual powder na nabibili lang kung saan-saan. 🙈 It’s a 10/10 for us!

As for me, I ordered my go-to: an iced americano. Plus we tried some food, clubhouse sandwich and their grilled chicken. The coffee was okay, nothing burnt or lasang naalawan 🤭 so that’s a win. Loved the clubhouse, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side.

Overall: Matcha – 10/10
Food – 8/10
Ambiance – 8/10

Lately, my passion has taken on a new meaning: it’s become my way of helping my youngest daughter, Poala, chase her dream of becoming a nurse.

We’re going through a difficult season, and income has been scarce. But I still believe in doing what I can—day by day, word by word.

Every coffee you send helps pay for Poala’s tuition, uniforms, transportation, and school needs. More than that, it helps carry us through this storm with dignity.

## Key Features Analysis

the quality of chocolate coated espresso beans relies on a harmonious blend of several crucial elements. From the bean origin and roast level to the type of chocolate used and the coating process, each factor plays a meaningful role in the final product.

**Bean Origin and Quality:** Identifying the source of the espresso beans is crucial. Beans from regions known for high-quality arabica,such as Ethiopia,Colombia,or Brazil,often result in a superior flavor profile. The quality of the bean itself impacts the overall taste, with well-sorted, defect-free beans providing the best results.

The beans used for chocolate covered espresso beans need to be selected for their flavor characteristics and their ability to hold up to the chocolate coating process.Ideally, the beans come from farms with lasting growing practices.

**Roast Level:** The roast level significantly affects the flavor of the espresso bean. A medium to dark roast generally works best for chocolate covered espresso beans, as it provides a robust and balanced bitterness that complements the sweetness of the chocolate. Overly light roasts may not offer enough intensity, while extremely dark roasts can become too bitter or burnt.

This roasting process is crucial for extracting all the delicious flavors that make dark chocolate covered espresso beans remarkable. A fine bean can be utterly transformed here.

**Chocolate Type and Quality:** The type of chocolate used for coating significantly impacts the overall taste. High-quality dark chocolate, typically containing between 60% and 70% cocoa solids, provides a rich and complex flavor that complements the espresso bean. Milk chocolate offers a sweeter choice, but may overpower the coffee flavor for some. Using real cocoa butter is also critically important for a smooth and luxurious mouthfeel, while cheaper alternatives can result in a waxy texture.

Ingredients like cocoa butter should be used. Some companies attempt to use cheaper substitutions, but it ends up effecting the overall taste and satisfaction of the beans.

**Coating Process and Texture:** The coating process determines the texture and consistency of the chocolate layer. A well-executed coating is smooth, even, and not too thick, allowing the espresso bean's flavour to shine through. The “bloom”, or the whitish coating often seen on low quality chocolate, is a sign of improper tempering or storage.The surface should be glossy and appealing.

The submission of the chocolate matters just as much as the chocolate material. The thickness and consistency of the beans coating needs to be at the appropriate level.

Key features to consider when choosing chocolate coated espresso beans:

*   High-quality espresso beans from reputable origins
*   Balanced medium to dark roast for optimal flavor
*   Dark chocolate with a high cocoa content and real cocoa butter
*   Smooth and even chocolate coating with a glossy finish

## Core Benefits

Chocolate coated espresso beans provide several benefits that make them a popular treat for coffee lovers and those seeking a swift energy boost.

**Enhanced Energy boost:** The combination of caffeine from the espresso bean and the stimulating effects of dark chocolate provide a more sustained and enjoyable energy boost compared to coffee alone. The chocolate slows down the absorption of caffeine, preventing the jitters and crashes often associated with conventional coffee consumption.
If you want a short burst of energy, the caffeine within these beans is a great alternative to harmful energy drinks.

**delicious and Satisfying Flavor:** The blend of rich dark chocolate and the intense flavor of espresso beans creates a truly satisfying and indulgent experience. High-quality chocolate complements the coffee's bitterness,resulting in a balanced and delicious treat. This synergy of flavors satisfies cravings and provides a delightful sensory experience.

The delightful combination of both the coffee and dark chocolate flavor produces a unique and pleasurable feeling for your taste buds. It's designed to be a treat and a delight to all who seek it.**Convenient and Portable:** Chocolate coated espresso beans are incredibly convenient and portable,making them an ideal snack for on-the-go consumption.They don't require any planning or equipment, making them perfect for travel, work, or outdoor activities. Their compact size allows you to easily carry them in your pocket, bag, or car.

They can be taken on the go, making them a much better alternative to an everyday cup of coffee.

**Mood Enhancement:** Both chocolate and coffee have mood-boosting properties. Chocolate contains compounds like phenylethylamine, which is associated with feelings of love and happiness, while coffee can improve alertness and focus.the combination of these two ingredients can create a positive and uplifting effect on your mood.

The stimulants in both coffee and chocolate, when combined, have positive effects on the cognitive and emotional parts of the human brain. They help you stay alert as well as feel positive while you're doing it.

1l67nql,https://www.reddit.com/r/shivamogga/comments/1l67nql/making_a_list_of_all_the_best_food_itemsplaces/,Making a list of all the best food items/places,"Namaskaara ellaru!
I've been living in Shimoga since the past 1.5–2 years. It's been great, but often I find myself racking my brains to find a good food place.


Being a small city, it does have it's good share of amazing food spots. But the thing is, there is a clear lack of variety of cuisines available. Great spots for naati, Malenadu-style cuisine, but otherwise I find it very difficult to branch out to other cuisines.
So I thought I'll make a list of what all food items I like the best and where.


This is not an exhaustive list, I want the suggestions of other Shimogans (lol I don't know how to address people from Shimoga). 


**Best dose: A food stall in veg food court** (don't know the name, but they're the only ones who serve paddu as well and in the morning, serve breakfast on Jail road). 
Other than that, **Saivaram** is giving great competition to **Meenakshi Bhavan**. 
Other details: Meenakshi can really improve on the attitude of waiters. 
Good filter coffee at Meenakshi > Saivaram. Also, I like the kesaribath also better at Meenakshi, because their rawa grain is thicker than Saivaram. The kesaribaath at Saivaram tastes pasty.


**Best idli: Asha Tiffin Room**, goes really well with their different take on sambar. 
**Saivaram** has great ghee pudi thatte idli. 
But if we are talking about the best sambar, then I guess the vote goes to **Balaji Tiffin Room**.
There's another food cart which serves really great thatte idli near Freedom Park. 


**Best naati-style biryani**:  **Grand Malnad** > **Donne biryani Mane**. The problem with Donne Biryani Mane is, even though they nail the rice, the chicken pieces are quite tough. On the other hand, Grand Malnad does the chicken pieces really soft and well-cooked, and on most days the rice is also good. But on some days, the rice, especially towards the end of the day, gets overpowered by the masala. 


**Best Hyderabadi biryani: Taj Hotel** (in front of Bearys mall) mutton > chicken
The place has been renovated and is bustling with crowd all the time. Grilled chicken is also great. Didn't appreciate the mandi much, I feel they use a lot of soda in the rice. Mutton pieces were good though.


**Best mandi: Sham's Palace** - Mutton juicy mandi – a must-try!


**Best Al-faham: Bright Palace.** 
Order the pepper al-faham if you like it spicy. Mutton and chicken biryani is also good, but quality fluctuates at times. 


**Best shawarma: Bright Palace** – as authentic as it can get in Shimoga. Pickles on the side is a plus point.


**Best rasam: Maratha Mane**, as far as I have tried. Really pungent, spicy and gives you that much-needed kick on a rainy afternoon. 


**Best pizza: Chimney's Pizzeria**, hands down. A new entrant, but they're already famous with their hand-rolled, Neapolitan pizzas. Pastas are good.
The sides are a bummer though. 


**Best sandwiches: Onebite**. Sandwiches are really fresh, with good bread and filling. 
Other than their sandwiches, rest of the menu pretty much is quite disappointing. Do not order their burgers, buns are always very stale and the patty is dry.


**Best fish tawa fry: Kundapura > Karavali > Macchli**


**Best chicken ghee roast: Macchli**


**Best korri roti + chicken gassi: Macchli**


**Best catla fry: Durgamba** — their marinade is really good. Also, special mention: **Sarovar.**


**Best baale-oota (veg): G R Mess**. Options are several, including holige (On Mondays and Thursdays), thaalipattu, jolada rotti, chapathi, rice, chitranna, puliyogare, etc. 
One downside is that people can be rude sometimes.


**Best egg dishes: Egg Palace and Eggista**


**Best fried chicken: 
Nandeesh Fried Chicken** for their chicken shots and wings
**2244**, a food cart, one in front of Freedom Park and one in front of Vishal Mart - great fried chicken burgers


**Best drinking place: Hive > Kanauj > Maya bar > Guru.**
Guru is not very appropriate for ladies, I feel. More of a men's watering hole kind of a place.


**Best North Indian: 
Veg: Punjabi Dhaba
Non-veg: Anmol > Krishi**


**Best filter coffee: 
Cothas > Malnad coffee** (several branches) > **Vidhathri Bhavan** (the one near Bharat Gas)


**Best Sunday Mutton breakfast:
Durgamba**: best soup, good mutton chops with thatte idli and kaima is also good. 
**Mahadevanna Mutton Palav**: will vouch for their mallige idli-mutton chops combo anyday. I like their chicken palav > mutton palav


**Decent Chinese: Bake and Flake**



A few others warrant a special mention, like:
**Foodies**: on Saturdays, they serve this bowl of chutti chooru - a Kerala speciality consisting of a bed of rice, with different types of meat, eggs, fish, different chutneys and veggies. It is a wholesome meal in itself. 


**Appam Kitchen**: available for orders, but really great appam and gravies. They also serve puttu and kadala curry. 


**Sri Vishnu Bhojanalaya and Caterers**: really great and authentic Rajasthani thaalis. They give it on a mess basis as well as separate thaalis. Their Sunday thaali is always a hit. 



**Places with great ambience:  
Krishi  
Chimney's Pizzeria  
Kanauj (outer section)  
Maya bar  
Hive  
Aura** (limited seating, weirdly they do not have 4 seater tables. It's either 2-seater or directly 6- seater, which is stupid.)



**Some places which hugely disappointed:  
Grub Monkeys  
Breathe Cafe  
Aura** - their cakes/desserts have disappointed always. Really mediocre tbh. Their other veg dishes are really good though, especially their pasta.


Like I said, this is not an exhaustive list. I want your suggestions and your best voted places/dishes so that we can spread the word about each of these restaurants and help our fellow foodies.

Back then, when we were in the same school, they were my only friends. I’m an introvert and they’re extroverts, but we clicked—we were always together, and I truly valued the bond we shared.

Things changed when I transferred to a different school. I got busier, and though I understood our schedules wouldn’t always align, I still made an effort. They would often say things like “paramdam ka naman” or “masaya na 'yan sa new friends niya.” At first, I took it lightly, but it hurt when they repeatedly joked that I was forgetting them. The truth is, I’m only with my new friends because we’re in the same class—something I never held against them when they made new friends too.

On my birthday last year, I invited just them and one SHS friend I’m close with. I reminded them twice and they even promised to cook. But only my SHS friend showed up—we waited four hours before the others came. By then, the joy was gone, and I cried myself to sleep that night.

Since then, I’ve slowly grown distant. I stopped joining conversations in the GC because I couldn’t relate anymore. Still, when one of them reached out and cried to me, I listened and stayed with her—we even talked over coffee. That’s how much I value them.

This year, I invited them again for my birthday. They said yes, but didn’t post any greetings like they used to. On the day itself, they said they'd come after an event… but never showed up. Thankfully, my current friends and boyfriend were there to bring me joy. Even my boyfriend said I shouldn’t let it slide—it’s too much. Still, I’m considering everything.

There was also a moment that stung—one friend telling me to come to someone else’s birthday as if I didn’t exist.

Now, I keep wondering: if I’m falling, will they be there? That question made me realize—should I keep compromising and giving effort when it’s not being returned? I’m open to communication, but none of us have brought up our concerns.

P.S. They invited me to a birthday recently, but I haven’t responded yet—I’m still trying to find peace of mind and clarity. ",1,1749372509.0,Rants,1,1.0,False

This is the final day of our 5-part Stubborn Belly Bulge Reset, and today we’re turning everything we’ve covered into a real-life blueprint.

This isn’t about perfection.
It’s about helping your body feel safe enough to let go of what it’s been holding onto—fat, inflammation, bloating, and survival mode.

⸻

Your HCAM Belly Fat Reversal Blueprint:

1. Calm the Cortisol Loop
	•	Start your day with natural light + protein
	•	Delay caffeine until after breakfast
	•	Add 5–10 mins of slow breathing, stretching, or walking daily

2. Rebuild a Strong, Supported Core
	•	Practice vacuum breathing (1 min before meals, 3x/day)
	•	Try castor oil packs or warm belly compresses at night
	•	Focus on posture + low-impact strength work to reconnect to your deep core

3. Reduce Visceral Fat Signals
	•	Use gentle IF (12–14 hrs)—not as restriction, but as recovery
	•	Break your fast with protein + fiber + healthy fat
	•	Avoid high-sugar, high-stim “breakfasts” (like just coffee + toast)

4. Fight Inflammation (From Your Fridge)
	•	Daily anti-bloat tea: ginger + turmeric + lemon
	•	Add one cruciferous veggie/day: cabbage, kale, broccoli
	•	Sea salt + lemon water to support digestion + reduce cortisol spikes

⸻

What You DON’T Need to Do:
	•	Cut out entire food groups
	•	Work out 6 days/week
	•	Track every macro
	•	Hate your body while you “fix” it

⸻

What You DO Need:
	•	A system that works with your biology
	•	Strategies that calm your nervous system
	•	Foods + rituals that help you feel safe, supported, and clear

⸻

💬 Reflection Prompt:

Which part of this reset hit you the most?
If you had to pick ONE thing to start with this week—what would it be?

""Let's go, Mena. You're feeling better. I should take you to school. Mena stood reluctantly.  I suggested, ""You can ride with us. We should get going too. No,"" Denton said quickly with a hand at his sister's elbow..........","Bryce bit back a smile. Leisha gulped and had the whole deer in headlights look again. Mena just frowned. Denton leaned forward and retorted, ""It may work wonders in bed, darling. In real life, people are going to stop dancing to your tune real quick. Funny how you're still dancing,"" I mused.  
A wall slammed in place over Denton's eyes and he stood up. ""Let's go, Mena. You're feeling better. I should take you to school. Mena stood reluctantly.  I suggested, ""You can ride with us. We should get going too. No,"" Denton said quickly with a hand at his sister's elbow. ""I'll take her. I don't know if she'll actually get there with you. Bryce laughed. Was that an insult?"" I joined in Bryce's amusement.  
Denton shook his head and dragged Mena behind him. We watched through the window and saw him shake his arm in the air at her. Mena shrugged him off and got into the passenger seat. A moment later Denton followed and his tires squealed out of the parking lot. What…,"" Leisha breathed out. ""What was that? I shrugged and stood, ""Let's go."" Game over. Leisha led the way and Bryce fell in step beside me. He ignored my back pocket and slid his fingers into my thong's top strap. His thumb gently caressed the outside of my pants and he murmured into my ear, ""Big Fame Steele's got a temper on him. I know. He held me back and the coffee shop's door shut with us on the inside and Leisha on the outside. She stopped at my car and glanced back for us. He nipped at my bottom lip and murmured, huskily, ""Can we please ditch this girl?""  
  
  ""And do what?"" I nipped back.  
  
  Bryce slid his tongue against mine before he replied, ""Do what we should've done yesterday.""  
  
  ""Spend the whole day in bed?"" I laughed and pushed away from him.  
  
  ""Why not?""  
  
  I looked in surprise and saw that he was serious.  
  
  ""Whatever, Bryce. You have scouts all this week."" I moved to leave, but he caught my arm again.  
  
  ""What?"" I asked again, breathless.  
  
  ""I'll still play. Let's skip. Come on.""  
  
  ""You won't play and you know it."" His coach was strict, which was needed with Bryce. Coach Bewer was also a pseudo father figure to Bryce, including punishment and discipline. The soccer field was probably the only place that Bryce didn't get away with our games.  
  
  ""Seriously, Sheldon.""  
  
  ""Seriously, Bryce,"" I said firmly. ""No."" I slipped out of his hold and was outside before he could drag me back inside.  
  
  Bryce followed reluctantly and shot me a dark look as he sat in the passenger seat.  
  
  Leisha just watched us both warily. She was like a breath of fresh air.  
  
  Chapter 7  
  
  Bryce didn't comment the entire drive back towards school, but it wasn't a long drive until I turned the engine off.  
  
  A group of students stood just outside the school's doors. Some smoked, some just chatted.  
  
  ""There's Yerling,"" Bryce noted and gestured towards the door. Sure enough, Yerling and his posse stood amongst the group.  
  
  I sat back with the keys in my hand. I wasn't sure I wanted to be around for whatever was going to happen.  
  
  Leisha had moved to the door handle, but she paused and waited for us.  
  
  ""Go,"" I said briskly and she left. Bryce and I both watched as Chad stepped to the front of the group. He threw his cigarette to the ground and watched my car. His eyes trailed to Leisha, but he let her pass without a second look.  
  
  He still looked bloodied. A large bruise had formed at his jaw and at the corner of his eye. His nose was swollen and his eye was bloodshot.  
  
  ""Holy,"" I murmured. ""He looks awful.""  
  
  Bryce bristled beside me.  
  
  ""Your knuckles didn't look like they'd done that.""  
  
  Bryce didn't comment on that, but he said instead, ""Let's go back to your place."" He grinned charmingly, ""You can put ice on my knuckles.""  
  
  ""It's not the only thing that needs ice.""  
  
  He grinned faintly, but moved across and kissed the underside of my jaw.  
  
  ""Seriously."" I put a hand on his chest, intending to push him away.  
  
  He slid a hand down the inside of my thigh until I firmly pushed him back.  
  
  ""What is up with you?"" I demanded, seriously. ""Contrary to what you might think, I don't spend my days on my back."" At the glint of amusement, I added, ""Or straddling some guy or on my knees. What is going on with you?""  
  
  ""Nothing,"" he said tightly and settled back in his seat.  
  
  I watched him, concerned.  
  
  ""Bryce,"" I said softly. No more games.  
  
  He glanced away, but I heard his breath of surrender.  
  
  A moment later, he relented, ""I don't need to be at practice anymore.""  
  
  ""Why not?""  
  
  ""Because I'm off the team.""  
  
  ""What?!""  
  
  ""It's not like that,"" he said hastily. ""I already got the scholarship. They don't want me to play high school anymore.""  
  
  Oh.  
  
  I sat back stunned. And then I cried out, ""That's not fair. They can't do that."" He'd miss everything. His senior games, play-offs, even state—and that's if they got there without him.  
  
  ""They already did. Dad met with them last night and finalized everything.""  
  
  ""You're really not playing for the rest of the year.""  
  
  He nodded.  
  
  ""How's your coach feel about that?""  
  
  Bryce's jaw clenched and he replied tightly, ""He's not happy.""  
  
  ""Did you go to practice last night?""  
  
  ""Yeah, but I didn't need to.""  
  
  ""Why didn't you tell me?""  
  
  ""Because I didn't want to be having this conversation,"" he pointed out.  
  
  ""Bryce, you're such a shit.""  
  
  He chuckled.  
  
  ""Does Corrigan know?""  
  
  ""Yeah.""  
  
  ""Corrigan knows and I didn't?""  
  
  ""Because of this. You're acting like a girl.""  
  
  ""I'm acting like your best friend, idiot,"" I retorted and slammed the door as I got outside. As I stalked away, Bryce called my name. I ignored him and kept going.  
  
  I had moved almost all the way to the door before Chad caught my elbow.  
  
  ""Back off,"" I snapped as I wrenched my arm free.  
  
  In a flash, Bryce was at my side. He maneuvered to stand between me and Chad.  
  
  ""Hey, hey."" Chad had a feral smile on his face. He raised his hands and backed up. ""I'm not going to hurt her. Oh, that's right. I never hurt her in the first place.""  
  
  ""You're a wounded animal."" I grinned at him, back on familiar ground. ""You've been put down, but you just keep coming back for more.""  
  
  Bryce moved so his back was to me. He had effectively cut me off from Chad's glare.  
  
  ""What's wrong, Scout?"" Chad taunted. ""You don't even want your girlfriend talking to me?""  
  
  ""Back off, Yerling.""  
  
  A sophomore had come to the  
door, but turned back when he noticed what was going on.  
  
  ""Or you're going to mess up my face again? I heard Raimler got arrested for my car. Thanks, by the way. Now I know where to send my insurance information. Are you going to pay for my medical bills?""  
  
  Bryce remained silent. Again, he didn't have to say anything.  
  
  It seemed to infuriate Chad even more because he shook his head and spat, ""You know what pisses me off about you, Scout? You, Raimler, and your little girlfriend walk around this school like you own it. The only reason you get away with everything is because you do to everyone else what you did to me and to that kid from the office. Someone goes against your unspoken rules and you knock him down.""  
  
  The door shoved open behind me and Corrigan pushed his way to Bryce's side.  
  
  Chad glared at him now.  
  
  ""What do you want, Raimler? You weren't a part of this conversation.""  
  
  Corrigan grinned, self-assured, and shot back, ""Maybe I should've been. You mess with my friends and you mess with me.""  
  
  Bryce shifted on his feet. Corrigan moved forward, just a slight inch of a step, but everyone knew that Corrigan was the threat now. Bryce had moved to the background.  
  
  I had become nonexistent to the guys. It wasn't even about me, not anymore. I wondered if it had ever been about me. I remembered Chet's words and Bryce's. They had both said that Chad had been off lately. He'd pulled some stunts that weren't okay with the guys.  
  
  There was a code among the guys. They could do a lot, say a lot, but nothing would be done as a reprimand. It makes a person wonder what was so bad for Chad to be taken down. And to have all the guys be okay with it.  
  
  I glanced over my shoulder and saw a bunch more had followed Corrigan. Chet, Holster, and some others must've left through a side door. They came from behind us and had formed a circle around Chad and his group. Some of those guys started to look nervous.  
  
  Corrigan was saying, ""You know what you did, Yerling. You better watch it.""  
  
  ""Or what?"" Chad sneered. He took a step closer. ""You're going to hurt me, Raimler? You and Scout. You can't hurt me by yourself. We both know that.""  
  
  Corrigan bit back his words, but Bryce shifted again. That same inch and suddenly he was back in charge. He murmured, seemingly relaxed, ""I can hurt you.""  
  
  Chad's glare seemed to darken and his eyes skimmed over me. Whatever he thought, he didn't share. A second later, one of the guys murmured, ""Teacher.""  
  
  Immediately the group dispersed. Chad and his friends took off into the parking lot while everyone else either took a lounging stance or walked back inside the school. And me? I headed inside and actually went to the rest of my classes. I even disappeared to my art room during lunch. I wasn't eager for a replay with Chad Yerling and the rest. I didn't even want to banter with Corrigan.  
  
  Mr. Sayword glanced at me questioningly, but he didn't say anything. When I was in the developing room later, a brisk knock sounded and I called out, ""Yeah?""  
  
  Mr. Sayword called through, ""Can I come in?""  
  
  I flipped the switch and the door opened. He closed it behind him and flipped the switch back.  
  
  I waited. He'd never come in before.  
  
  ""Uh huh."" Mr. Sayword cleared his throat and shuffled on his feet. My art teacher was nervous. He tucked his longish sandy-colored hair behind his ears and straightened the wire-rim glasses over his nose bridge. His buttoned-down shirt was a little rumpled, but his pants were still nicely pleated.  
  
  ""Yes?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Uh…Miss Connors called me into her office for a consultation.""  
  
  ""What?"" I asked sharply.  
  
  ""She has heard about our unique teacher-student bond.""  
  
  What bond? I respected the guy. That was a bond?  
  
  I remained silent.  
  
  ""Yes, she—uh—she wanted to ask my opinion on your state of well-being.""  
  
  ""What'd you say?""  
  
  He blinked, his eyes were magnified behind the glasses, but he gazed in stupefaction to me. He stared another moment and I noticed that his eyelashes were rich and plump. I was jealous. I wish I had those eyelashes.  
  
  ""I said…well, to be quite honest, I told her that I had always thought you were a magnificent student. You've always been on time. A hard worker. You've never talked back to me or bullied another student. Your projects are always done wondrously with a touch of genius.""  
  
  What the hell? I blinked.  
  
  ""Miss Connors was…she was, well…she was—she seemed a bit taken aback by my opinion and thought perhaps we have an unusual bond.""  
  
  My smile was barely constrained when I guessed, ""She thinks we're sleeping together?""  
  
  He coughed and pounded his chest. He needed to turn away and cough some deep wrenching hacks before he was composed. When he turned back, he gulped and looked at me.  
  
  I held firm and stared him down. That's when I saw the truth.  
  
  The one teacher that earned my respect is the one rumored to be my lover. Poetic, really.  
  
  ""What do you want me to do?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Well,"" he began, ""I really just wanted to make you aware of the situation. Miss Connors seemed to have quite a list of concerns about you.""  
  
  ""Do I quit the class?""  
  
  To this, I saw my first glimpse of anger in my normally-composed teacher.  
  
  ""No."" He said it short, simple, and final.  
  
  I grinned despite the situation and replied, ruefully, ""I'm guessing Miss Connors doesn't know about those balls.""  
  
  He frowned, but replied, ""Well, Miss Jeneve, now that you have been apprised of the situation, I will leave you to your work."" He nodded and I saw some amusement that tickled the corner of his mouth.  
  
  I finished a drawing for the rest of sixth period and headed to the cafeteria for study hall.  
  
  Chet moved down and I took his seat. The rest of the group all moved, grumbled, saw it was for me and shut up. I hid a smile at their expense. Bryce dropped his history books on the table across from me and sat beside Becky Lew.  
  
  No one reacted, but—like always—they watched me for the reaction.  
  
  I disappointed them all and focused on my homework. I finished my calculus and got up to buy a pop. When I returned to the table, Bryce was back at his seat across from mine. Becky Lew and her friends had moved to the open section of the cafeteria. They were painting signs for the soccer and basketball team. The rest of the cheerleaders had moved into the cafeteria so it must've been a planned event.  
  
  I ignored Bryce and started my history homework until the final bell rang. Bryce walked beside me towards my locker and asked, ""What are you doing after school?""  
  
  I ignored him, but then he tapped my arm and leaned closer when we arrived at my locker. His arm draped across the top of the locker and he effectively entrapped me against the locker.  
  
  ""What are you doing now?""  
  
  I shook my head and slipped out from underneath.  
  
  ""Sheldon,"" he called out.  
  
  ""I'll see you later,"" I called over my shoulder and disappeared around the corner.  
  
  The counselor's office was vacated, but the back office doors were still open. I walked to Miss Connors, knowing from prior trips where her office was located and watched her shuffle papers around her desk. She gripped a pencil in her teeth and frowned at her computer screen. The day must've been long for her because there were sweat marks down the back of her silk blouse and her skirt was rumpled where she would sit on it.  
  
  She sighed in frustration to herself and wrote a note on a pad near the phone.  
  
  I cleared my throat.  
  
  As Miss Connors whirled in her chair to see me, I said tightly, ""So I hear that you think I'm sleeping with a teacher?""  
  
  ""Sheldon,"" she murmured, reproachfully.  
  
  I walked in, shut the door, and took a seat in the lounger besides her desk.  
  
  ""It's out of line and I'm a bit disappointed in how unoriginal you are,"" I said firmly and leaned back.  
  
  She smiled tensely and retorted, ""Got you in here, didn't it?""  
  
  ""So you know it's a lie?""  
  
  ""I know that you're not sleeping with Mr. Sayword, but you have to admit that it's a bit suspect. You mouth off to the teachers except him. You are either consistently late or you don't show up at all, except sixth period. You've never been tardy to one of his classes and you've had him for four years now. The days you do skip, you always stay after the next day."" She sighed. ""You do the math.""  
  
  ""I respect him.""  
  
  ""Your other two friends have never shared an art class with you. Is that why? Do you act out because you're reacting to their influence?""  
  
  I didn't even dignify that with an answer.  
  
  ""No."" Miss Connors ran a hand through her straw-colored thin hair. ""I didn't think you'd respond to that one either.""  
  
  ""What do you want?"" I asked, my eyes flat.  
  
  She seemed to consider me for a moment before she replied, ""Honestly?""  
  
  I nodded, mute.  
  
  ""I care about you and I think you're wasting an unfair amount of potential. You could be in college. Yes, I know that you've heard this already and I don't care. You could be the captain of track, volleyball, yearbook staff. You could have any number of prestigious scholarships if you wanted. I've read some of your essays. You have so much talent and I cannot stand the fact that you just waste it away.""  
  
  ""I'm living a typical teenager's life.""  
  
  ""A typical teenager is not rumored to screw an entire sports team.""  
  
  I hadn't been aware of that one. It made me smile.  
  
  ""I see."" Miss Connors groaned. ""You think that's funny. Granted, I've watched you around campus and I'm impressed at the amount of power you seem to hold with the other students. However, I'm not stupid."" She shook her head as her bore into mine. ""I know what girls have to do to earn that spot.""  
  
  ""Did you call me a whore?""  
  
  ""What? No!"" Miss Connors looked horrified and flushed. ""That's not what I meant. I just..."" She caught the amusement in my eyes and sighed in disappointment. With a gentled tone, she asked, ""Have you heard from your parents lately?""  
  
  ""No."" I stood up and shook my head. I moved to the door.  
  
  ""Wait. Please, Sheldon?""  
  
  ""I'm not some wasted space due to negligent parents. That's not me, not who I am. I'm not going to talk to you about my hurt feelings because the last time I heard from my parents was three months ago."" I left the room and walked down the hallway. Just before I opened the counselor's door that connected to the senior hallway, I stopped and heard a resigned sigh from her office.  
  
  My hand paused for a moment, but I hardened inside and left.  
  
  Chapter 8  
  
  I drove past the Café Diner and saw Bryce's car in the parking lot. Corrigan's was somewhere else. As I continued home, I sent a text to Bryce and Corrigan telling them that I had beer waiting at home.  
  
  When I got home, I removed one of the cases that was still in my car from our previous trip to the diner. I stuffed it underneath the steps leading to the connecting door. As I moved down the hallway to unlock the front door, I found a note that had been stuffed underneath the door. I opened it and read:  
  
  Whores get stoned to death. Are you the stone or whore? Or maybe you're death.  
  
  I laughed and crumpled it up. After a quick toss to the garbage, I pulled out a frozen pizza and warmed the oven. It took two minutes for the oven's pre-warm up bell to ring and as I slid the pizza in, my front door opened. Bryce and Corrigan were both laughing as they made their way inside.  
  
  ""Grab the beer from my trunk,"" I shouted over their laughing.  
  
  Corrigan hollered, ""Will do.""  
  
  Logan was the first to appear around the corner. She was hesitant, but seemed to relax when she saw an easy grin on my face. I still hadn't formally met the girl, but I was determined to be in a gracious mood. There was no bitchery allowed when it was beer and pizza night.  
  
  I crossed my feet as I leaned against the corner and stared at her.  
  
  She changed her expression back to caution and edged, hesitantly, onto one of the stools.  
  
  Neither of us said a thing.  
  
  Logan stared at anything except me. Her hands also seemed to fight with each other. She'd hold them still, then they'd start trembling, and she'd jerk only to start it all over again.  
  
  When I heard footsteps jog down the stairs, I smiled to myself at her predicament. She's with a guy, one of the most popular, and thinking she's his new girlfriend. She's in his other best friend's house, who's a girl, who's known to get her jollies by taunting girls just like her. What to do?  
  
  Predicament.  
  
  A moment later, Bryce and Corrigan both walked in with a case in their arms.  
  
  Awkward silence time was done…for now.  
  
  I raised an eyebrow and murmured, ""You could only handle one case?"" I said it in disdain.  
  
  Corrigan wasn't affected and grinned cockily. He jumped onto the counter right in front of Logan and shot back, ""I'm just conserving my energy for more pleasurable activities.""  
  
  He ran a hand down the side of Logan's face and lingered at her lips.  
  
  Logan flushed, but didn't move her head back. She even relaxed her lips and Corrigan slipped his finger inside where, after a moment's hesitation, she sucked it. Her eyes looked somewhere else. Not at Corrigan, Bryce, or myself.  
  
  Bryce whistled in appreciation and asked, ""Why don't you do that for me?"" He held up his hand.  
  
  I punched him in the arm.  
  
  ""Ow!"" He cradled his arm, but smiled endearingly at me.  
  
  Corrigan sniffed the air and asked, ""Please tell me that I'm smelling pizza?""  
  
  ""You are."" I knew my eyes were frosty as I watched Logan take  
two of Corrigan's fingers into her mouth.  
  
  ""Hey,"" Corrigan suddenly said as he noticed something in the front hallway. ""You have a voice message on your machine."" He looked at me, confused, ""Since when do you use your machine?""  
  
  I'd been distracted with creepy notes. I hadn't noticed.  
  
  ""When was the last time someone even called your landline?"" Bryce asked.  
  
  Corrigan jumped off the counter and hit the play button.  
  
  A second later, I stiffened when I heard my mother's voice echo around the house's hallway and kitchen.  
  
  ""Hello, dear. This is your mother. I am calling because your father and I are getting a divorce. I won't be returning home for Thanksgiving and I have no idea what your father is planning over the holiday. I'll be in touch with my new number. Love you, honey. Hope you stay out of trouble.""  
  
  The air was thick in silence when the machine clicked it's end.  
  
  All three watched me, but I was paralyzed.  
  
  Finally, I choked out, ""God.""  
  
  Corrigan reached inside one of the beer cases and offered a bottle. Bryce took it, opened it, and moved it into my numb fingers.  
  
  I downed it.  
  
  Another beer came along and I downed that one.  
  
  A third proceeded the same until I spit it out and threw the bottle across the kitchen.  
  
  The buzzer rang on the oven, but I ignored it and walked upstairs. I passed my bed, headed straight for the bathroom, dropped my clothes, and stepped into my shower. I turned it to a scalding temperature and stood there, with my head hung downwards. After awhile, I slid down and wrapped my arms around my legs, hugging them to my chest.  
  
  I don't know how long I stayed there, but I stayed when I felt the first chill. I didn't move until my entire body trembled from the cold. And I wasn't too surprised to see that Bryce had taken root on my toilet seat when I climbed out. I wrapped a towel around my body and moved into my bedroom. After I closed the door, I just crawled into bed and pulled the covers over me.  
  
  Bryce stood beside the bed. He watched me.  
  
  After awhile he slid to sit on the floor beside my bed. He didn't watch me, but just stayed there.  
  
  I didn't cry. I didn't do anything.  
  
  ""Do you want a beer?"" Bryce asked sometime later.  
  
  ""Yes.""  
  
  ""Okay."" He stood up and returned a little later with four beers. He uncapped two and handed one to me. I sat up and downed it. I passed him the empty bottle as he held out the second. The third and fourth went down the same way.  
  
  After the fourth, I looked up and asked, ""Is this a wrong coping mechanism?""  
  
  Bryce flashed a grin and my heart beat.  
  
  He leaned down and whispered, just before he touched his lips to mine, ""Coping is coping, baby. Either way, you get through it.""  
  
  I captured his lips in mine and found myself in his arms. I had one knee firmly between his legs on the bed and raised my body so I was kneeling above him.  
  
  ""I don't want her in this house.""  
  
  Bryce nodded and left. I heard the front door shut a few minutes later. With a tentative knock at my door, Corrigan called from the hallway, ""Can I come in for a minute?""  
  
  I didn't answer and the door was pushed open.  
  
  I had laid back down, still wrapped in my towel, but I knew my face was void of emotion.  
  
  Corrigan's eyes skipped over the empty beer bottles.  
  
  ""Hey,"" he murmured and moved to sit beside me. His hand came out to smooth down my hair, but I shoved it away.  
  
  ""Sorry,"" Corrigan breathed, ruefully. He took a deep breath and commented, ""So…drunk orgy is the way to go?""  
  
  Drunk orgy was the way to go.  
  
  He nodded and patted my shoulder. As he moved to the door he stopped short said, ""If you want to go hustling, give me a call.""  
  
  ""I will,"" I murmured, hoarsely.  
  
  Corrigan threw me a tender smile and moved through the door.  
  
  I laid there and heard a murmur of voices from the front hallway. A second later, the door shut again. Another minute and Bryce appeared in the doorway. He had the case of beer underneath his arm.  
  
  A grin slipped past my lips at the image of him.  
  
  He grinned back and moved to sit on the side of the bed.  
  
  After setting the case on the floor, he asked, ""You want another one?""  
  
  ""Yes."" I sat up and leaned against the headboard.  
  
  Bryce took two out. He handed one to me and downed his own.  
  
  I didn't down this one, but took some sips as I watched him stand up and empty his pockets. He placed his phone on the nightstand and then pulled his shirt over his head. He grabbed a handful of condoms and placed them on the nightstand before he sat back on the bed.  
  
  He met my gaze.  
  
  I took another sip and asked, ""Do you think I'm a whore?""  
  
  He frowned, but asked, ""How many guys have you slept with?""  
  
  ""Three."" I didn't hesitate.  
  
  ""No,"" he answered and I knew it was the truth. He had thought about it.  
  
  I murmured, ""Brian Kincaid. He was my first.""  
  
  ""Our first time was the end of freshman year.""  
  
  ""He was before that, long before that. He was my first boyfriend and I thought…I thought it was what I was supposed to do.""  
  
  Bryce took a drink from another beer and rubbed a hand over my leg. It wasn't meant to be seductive, but soothing. Comfort.  
  
  ""Nah,"" he murmured. ""Girls don't have to do anything they don't want to do.""  
  
  ""I know that now."" I hadn't then. I took a deep breath and finished my—I hadn't been counting—. Bryce took it out of my still numb fingers and placed it in the case.  
  
  ""We've been friends for a long time,"" I said quietly and laid back down.  
  
  ""Yep."" Bryce nodded. ""We became really good friends in…?""  
  
  ""When we were ten.""  
  
  ""That's right. And in seventh grade, you kissed me.""  
  
  ""You kissed me.""  
  
  ""No."" He shook his head and moved to lay beside me. He flipped on his stomach and threw one arm over my waist. His head rested on my shoulder and he gazed up at me.  
  
  ""Yes. I remember because it was during recess.""  
  
  ""No."" Bryce smiled at me, a beautiful sight. He inched closer. ""It was during lunch, but you kissed me because you wouldn't let me go and play football with the rest of the guys. I wasn't happy with you at all. Why would I kiss you if I wanted to play football?""  
  
  I noted, ""You're supposed to always say that you were the one who kissed me. That's what a gentleman does.""  
  
  Bryce laughed a full laugh and teased, ""You admit that I'm  right? You kissed me.""  
  
  I poked him in the arm. ""You're supposed to be a gentleman and say that you kissed me first.""  
  
  Bryce studied me and then said softly, ""You're right. I kissed you first.""  
  
  ""I know. That's what I've been saying this whole time."" I flashed him a blinding smile.  
  
  Then I remembered my mom's call and the smile vanished.

I’ve got around ₹50L in capital — ₹40L ( Ik its a huge amount and high risk but Im willing take the risk)is going toward buying an old house, and the rest will go into remodeling it into a cozy, nature-inspired café with rooftop and outdoor seating.

The café will have a warm aesthetic and target youth, families, and couples — especially pre/post movie crowds from a nearby theatre.

Sample Menu:
•Coffee: Cold brews, hand-pressed, iced lattes
•Food: Pastas, sandwiches, fries, shawarma
•Specials: Chicken steak, grilled fish, dessert shots
•Ambience: A mix of rustic + greenery + rooftop chill zone

Would love advice from anyone who’s done something similar:
	•	What unexpected issues did you run into?
	•	Tips on managing staff and maintaining quality?
	•	What helped you stand out in a small-town market?
	•	Mistakes I should avoid?

Nah, man,"" he laughed. ""When they cornered me, I got out all slow with my hands in the air. It was awesome, but they were rough when they cuffed me.  Bryce asked, ""They pull their guns? Yeah. A few. They put 'em away quick though when they realized I was just a kid. I bonded with my arresting officers. I was cracking jokes on the way to the station. And I told them all about Chad, what he did. What?"" Bryce asked sharply. ""Why the hell did you do that? They said they'd keep their eyes out for him. Man,"" Bryce groaned. ""If they go over there, they're going to want him to press charges against me. What? Nah."" Corrigan shook his head, but a cautious look flashed across. He laughed again and exclaimed, ""No way. Yerling won't say a thing. He knows what'll happen if he does. What is this? Like Fight Club?"" I mumbled. Yes,"" Corrigan answered while Bryce replied, ""No.They glanced at each other and shared a meaningful look. Corrigan corrected himself, ""I mean, it's not anything like Fight Club. Right,"" I scoffed in disbelief. The first rule: no one can talk about it. The second rule is: no one can talk about it. And the third rule is: if they do, they're out. Did I get it right? It's not like that."" Bryce met my eyes in the rearview mirror. ""Yerling's pulled some other stunts lately. He just needed to be put back in his place. That's all. Let's grab some food. I'm starving."" Corrigan pointed at the closest fast food and we trudged inside.  
  
  One of the girls whispered to her friend behind the counter and soon two additional employees were at the counter.  
  
  I groaned when Corrigan literally licked it up.  
  
  I sat at a nearby booth and waited as the two morons got their food. Bryce grabbed a soda for me, but neither moved for a moment when their food had been placed on their tray.  
  
  I marched up and grabbed the tray. As I moved past, I bumped shoulders with both of them on purpose.  
  
  ""Hey,"" Corrigan protested when he spilled his drink.  
  
  ""Oops,"" I deadpanned.  
  
  Bryce came to sit beside me on my side of the booth. Corrigan sat, inhaled his food, and grabbed the rest of his burger. He stood at the counter while he finished it and his drink.  
  
  Bryce relaxed against the booth and slid an arm on the back. He purposely stretched and slid his leg beside mine.  
  
  ""Stop,"" I murmured.  
  
  Bryce chuckled and leaned closer to me. He whispered in my ear, ""It'll be fine.""  
  
  I shrugged him off.  
  
  Bryce frowned and asked, ""What's wrong with you? You're usually up for this stuff.""  
  
  I was, but I acted like a 'girl.' That pissed me off more.  
  
  ""Nothing,"" I mumbled.  
  
  ""What? Is it Yerling?""  
  
  Nothing.  
  
  ""Is it what Steele said to you?""  
  
  Nothing.  
  
  ""Oh."" He got it. ""It's the counselor thing.""  
  
  I tensed beside him.  
  
  He leaned closer and pressed a kiss underneath my ear.  
  
  I relaxed slightly and closed my eyes when his hand slid onto my leg. He massaged just inside my thigh before he continued his exploration around my neck. I hung my head down, helpless and turned so he could capture my lips with his. I felt his fingers dip inside my pants and murmured, huskily, ""If you wanted to take my mind off that, its working.""  
  
  Bryce chuckled and his breath teased my skin.  
  
  ""Let's go. Now,"" I breathed.  
  
  Bryce shot up. ""Corrigan, we're leaving.""  
  
  Corrigan finished talking with one of the girls and jogged over with a suggestive smirk. ""You two go on. I'm going to grab a ride home with this girl.""  
  
  Bryce and I looked over and saw that she was giggling with another friend. They both blushed when they realized they were the center of our attention.  
  
  In the car, Bryce kept a hand on my leg. It stayed in place.  
  
  When we pulled into my driveway, I hit the garage opener on my keychain and Bryce pulled his car beside my mom's Chrysler. Mine was still parked outside.  
  
  ""Sheldon.""  
  
  We were startled when a figure spoke up from the driveway's darkened edge, but she stepped forward and the light shone over Mena's strained face.  
  
  Bryce swore.  
  
  I let out a breath I'd been holding when I murmured, ""Mena. What are you doing here?""  
  
  It was almost midnight.  
  
  ""My brother came and talked to you, didn't he?"" she asked, anxious.  
  
  ""Uh…yeah."" We moved inside and into the kitchen. Mena followed and perched on the stool she'd earlier occupied. She hugged herself.  
  
  ""I knew he would."" She shook her head. ""He's just being an overprotective brother, but he doesn't understand anything.""  
  
  Bryce frowned at me. He nodded towards the kitchen table, but I shook my head. He went to the fridge and grabbed a beer before he disappeared upstairs.  
  
  ""Wow,"" Mena breathed out.  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  ""Bryce Scout. Wow.""  
  
  ""Are you serious? Your brother is Denton Steele.""  
  
  ""And my brother is my brother,"" she replied, dryly. ""Believe me. I don't see the allure.""  
  
  Let's hope not.  
  
  ""Uh…"" I shifted uncomfortably. ""I've had a really long night, so…""  
  
  ""Right. Cut to the chase."" Mena nodded. ""I can do that.""  
  
  I relaxed slightly.  
  
  ""Here's the thing…my brother thinks I'm this innocent little girl. He doesn't want me to be as worldly as you. That's a load of crap. Denton just wants to shelter me from all the bad stuff in this world and he thinks that you've seen more than your fair share.""  
  
  Um… This was nearing a 'near emotion' event.  
  
  Mena proceeded, unaware, ""I am a little sheltered. I'll own up to that, but he thinks that I haven't even had sex. That's not true. I've had sex with lots of guys, he just doesn't know about any of them.""  
  
  ""He seemed pretty sure that you hadn't had sex with your boyfriend.""  
  
  ""Because I hadn't,"" Mena said bluntly. ""Justin was Denton's errand boy. He told him everything. Justin and I never went further than kissing on the lips.""  
  
  Ewe. I cringed and asked, ""He asked your boyfriend if you guys…?""  
  
  ""Yeah. He was like Denton's spy. I figured it out pretty quick and realized that Justin was the perfect cover for me to live my life my way.""  
  
  I sucked in my breath. This talk was really becoming too uncomfortable.  
  
  ""Listen, I uh…"" I glanced towards the stairs and gestured upstairs. ""I've got…""  
  
  ""Okay."" Mena grinned widely and nodded, ""I get it. You have more important things to do than listen to me complain. I'll see you at school tomorrow?""  
  
  ""I doubt I'll be there.""  
  
  ""Oh. Oh yeah because of…that thing that happened, right?"" She watched me intently, but I smiled.  
  
  ""Okay."" Mena laughed again and moved to the front door. When she left, I locked the door, hit the garage button, and reset the security system. I stopped in the bathroom before I moved towards the light that shone out of my bedroom.  
  
  Bryce  
leaned against my headboard, shirtless, with an empty beer beside him. ESPN was on my flat-screen.  
  
  I shut off the lights and shimmied out of my jeans and sweatshirt. I crawled underneath the covers and felt Bryce pull me into his arms. I could smell my mint toothpaste on his breath.  
  
  ""Who was that girl?"" he asked.  
  
  ""That was Steele's little sister. She started at our school today and asked to be my friend."" I still felt weird about the whole thing.  
  
  ""That's the girl that Corrigan wants to bag?""  
  
  ""Yeah, but I don't think he knows how protective Denton is of his little sister."" I turned over and grinned up at Bryce as he looked at me.  
  
  ""It's kinda freaky,"" he frowned.  
  
  ""What is?"" I slid a leg up and nestled it between his.  
  
  ""That dude was here before and she showed up tonight. That's what's freaky.""  
  
  ""They're just…I don't know. Messed up or something. He cares about his sister and she's trying to have a life. I can relate.""  
  
  ""You can?""  
  
  ""No. Not really, but I think it's sweet.""  
  
  ""Because you haven't had that,"" Bryce bit out.  
  
  I slid my hand around his neck, but we both swore when his phone rang.  
  
  Bryce reached over me to grab it and cursed swiftly before he flipped it open. He sat up and murmured, ""Yeah, mom?"" He yawned a replied, ""No. No. I'm at Corrigan's house. We were watching the game. It's still on.""  
  
  A second later he closed his phone and placed it on my bedside table.  
  
  Since he was up there, I shifted smoothly underneath him and wrapped my legs around his waist.  
  
  Startled, Bryce shifted more comfortably, but bent and kissed my chin, then my cheek, lips.  
  
  He finished under my ear and I moaned.  
  
  Chapter 6  
  
  I woke and instantly knew Bryce wasn't beside me. I knew that without feeling for him or opening my eyes. He rarely was. Whenever he did sleep over, he was the first up and he rarely woke me for a morning round.  
  
  It was just something weird about us. We didn't do the morning quickie.  
  
  What he had done, though, was left my bedroom door open.  
  
  That was another thing about Bryce. He liked to leave my bedroom open. He told me once that it was because my room got unbearably stuffy, but I didn't mind. When I got up to close the door, I was surprised when I saw Bryce walk back in and pull his shirt over his head. I sat back and watched as he tugged it down to cover his chest.  
  
  I whistled appreciatively.  
  
  Bryce ignored me and shuffled some things underneath my bed until he emerged with a pair of men's sandals.  
  
  ""What are those doing under there?"" I asked as I fell onto the bed.  
  
  Bryce fitted a belt around his waist and replied, distracted, ""I dropped them down there awhile ago. It's going to be seriously hot today.""  
  
  ""I thought you were home.""  
  
  ""I'm going, but these are my favorite pair and since I remembered they were down there…"" He looked up and raked his eyes up and down my figure.  
  
  My sweatshirt had ridden up and a wide amount of skin showed.  
  
  I didn't move to cover up.  
  
  ""So what are you thinking about Corrigan's new girl from last night?"" Bryce turned away and leaned against the wall.  
  
  What'd I say? No morning quickies for us. Someday I might ask why that was, but not today.  
  
  I grinned slyly and sat up. I removed my sweatshirt and scooted up in bed, knowing that my pajama bottoms would get caught against my bedcovers. My movement would pull them down further. And they did.  
  
  Bryce noticed too.  
  
  ""I think it's pathetic,"" I said flatly, but I grinned slyly as I watched Bryce watch me.  
  
  ""She's cute. What are you pissed about?"" His eyes lingered at my hipbone where my thong peeked out.  
  
  ""I'm not. I'm a little tired of watching Corrigan roll over those girls, though. They let him do anything to them.""  
  
  Bryce swallowed slowly. He watched as I wiggled further up and my pants wiggled further down.  
  
  ""You let me do anything to you,"" he said huskily. ""And you haven't even met her.""  
  
  ""I don't have to meet her to know she's just like all the others,"" I said evenly. ""And I don't pant after you and I don't pin my heart on my sleeve."" Here we go, a conversation about the two of us was now on the table. The game was over.  
  
  His eyes whipped to mine and stayed there.  
  
  I sighed and stood. I moved to the closet and grabbed some clothes.  
  
  ""What's your problem?"" Bryce asked as he moved to the doorframe. He watched me strip down and step into the shower.  
  
  Over the water, I said, ""Nothing. I'm just kinda tired of having to be nice to those girls. They're around for, like, two minutes and then he's got another girl over."" If he wasn't going to say anything about 'us', then two could play at that.  
  
  ""Are you serious? You're actually mad that Corrigan plays these girls?""  
  
  ""No,"" I said tightly and finished rinsing my hair. I held Bryce's eyes and knew we thought the same thing. Bryce played the same games, but he played them when I wasn't around. And I did my own thing.  
  
  Bryce sighed and moved from the doorway. When I dressed in my bedroom, I heard the front door slam shut.  
  
  I wasn't planning on going to school, but I'd already gotten dressed so I figured…  
  
  Outside, just as I climbed into my car, I braked suddenly. Mena stood on her house's patio with a blank stare on her face. That was odd. I frowned, but reversed and drove to school. I wasn't about to put much thought into Mena's life when I barely thought about my own.  
  
  When I walked into school, I saw a group of guys surrounding Bryce at his locker. He was turned with his head bent as he listened to whatever Chet was saying. Corrigan stood on the outskirts with a girl with dark brown hair that fell to her waist. She was short, but had exotic eyes. They glowed when she looked at Corrigan, but she still looked awkward.  
  
  My guess, this was the girl from last night. And I smirked when I saw that Becky Lew stood on his other side, just behind him. Becky chatted with her friends while New Girl glanced self-consciously around. She hugged her books to her chest and averted her eyes when they trailed and met mine.  
  
  Holster nudged Corrigan and nodded in my direction. Corrigan immediately left the group and fell in line beside me. He threw an arm around my shoulder and said, cockily, ""So what do you think?""  
  
  ""I generally try not to think.""  
  
  Corrigan laughed and tightened his hold around my shoulders.  
  
  ""No, about Logan. What do you think about her?""  
  
  ""Are you serious?"" So that was her name.  
  
  ""Yeah. Why?""  
  
  I kicked my locker open.  
  
  ""Because,"" I murmured as I reached inside, ""you just ignored the girl.""  
  
  ""Well, yeah, but…it's the first morning. You know how it is.""  
  
  ""The school hierarchy, you mean. If you're all into her, everyone might think you have a girlfriend and they can't think that.""  
  
  ""Yeah."" He said like it made perfect sense.  
  
  ""Sometimes,"" I started and leaned against my locker, ""being the arrogant womanizer that you are might bite you in the rear.""  
  
  ""What do you mean?"" He shifted on his feet, but listened intently.  
  
  I shrugged.  
  
  ""Corrigan, someday you're going to meet a girl that's going to know her place with you and not be alright with that.""  
  
  ""Huh?"" he questioned.  
  
  ""Look, you know me. I don't care about these girls as long as you don't ask me to be nice, but one day one girl that you're going to actually want won't be okay with your chain of command.""  
  
  ""Not following.""  
  
  Bryce walked to us just then and punched Corrigan in the arm.  
  
  Corrigan ignored him and asked me, ""Seriously. What do you mean?""  
  
  Bryce glanced between the two of us.  
  
  I saw Becky Lew pass behind us. She skimmed her eyes over all three of us and her mouth tightened.  
  
  ""Do you really want a girl that's okay with all the other girls you got going on?"" I continued.  
  
  Bryce went still beside me.  
  
  I ignored him and waited for Corrigan's answer.  
  
  He shrugged.  
  
  ""Not really thinking about that right now, you know,"" he responded thoughtfully. The moment vanished when the first bell rang and self-assured Corrigan fell back into place.  
  
  He threw an arm around my shoulder and walked beside me.  
  
  Bryce disappeared in the opposite direction.  
  
  ""Seriously."" Corrigan asked, ""Should I take Logan, Mena, or Becky to Harris' party?""  
  
  ""Since when do you take girls to the party? You usually just show up and pick.""  
  
  ""That's right."" He laughed. ""That's why we're friends. Sure you don't want a ride with me?""  
  
  ""A ride?"" I teased, my eyes darkened. ""Or a ride?""  
  
  Amusement leapt to Corrigan's eyes and he smiled slowly.  
  
  ""You know which one."" He nudged me with his shoulder and patted my ass as he left for his own class.  
  
  I stayed in place and watched as he passed his first period classroom.  
  
  Corrigan didn't go to classes. That was a universal law. And someday, sometime, that law would come back to bite him in the butt.  
  
  Leisha smiled warmly as she approached the classroom and asked, ""No Corrigan this morning?""  
  
  ""Nope,"" I murmured and walked to our table.  
  
  We both sat down and I asked, ""Why can't we have coffee in our classes?""  
  
  ""No doubt,"" Leisha huffed and yawned dramatically.  
  
  Leisha was pretty cool. She wore the most outrageous outfits. She had on a taffeta shirt with ruffles on her neckline that spread past her shoulders.  
  
  Outrageous.  
  
  We had grown used to each other since we were assigned table-mates in the beginning of the year. I hadn't known who Leisha was before our first day in Calculus, but she had informed me that she'd always known who I was. At first she'd been on guard around me, but when she figured out that I wasn't going to screw with her, she started to relax. Now we almost seemed friendly to each other.  
  
  Just then Mr. Aldross entered the room and said, ""Miss Jeneve, you are wanted in the counselor's office.""  
  
  I stiffened and asked, tensely, ""Why? What for?""  
  
  He started to write on the chalkboard and responded, ""That is none of my business, Miss Jeneve. I would not know that information.""  
  
  I stayed in my seat.  
  
  Leisha watched me. So did the rest of the class.  
  
  Mr. Aldross wrote the daily set of questions from our assigned homework.  
  
  ""Okay, class…"" He turned back around and saw I had remained. His lips tightened as he stared at me. Clearing his throat, he asked, ""What are you still doing here, Miss Jeneve? You are wanted in the counselor's office.""  
  
  ""And I told the counselor yesterday that she can expel me. I'm not going to talk to her and you can't make me.""  
  
  He started to say something, but the words died in his throat.  
  
  Bryce walked in, late like normal.  
  
  Irritation flickered across Mr. Aldross' features before he spoke, ""Mr. Scout.""  
  
  Bryce dropped in his seat and leaned back in his chair. He didn't respond.  
  
  ""This is becoming a daily routine that grows tiresome.""  
  
  I met Bryce's eyes and smiled haughtily.  
  
  Bryce looked amused, but he stayed quiet.  
  
  ""Maybe you should sleep some more,"" I suggested.  
  
  Our teacher snapped his attention back to me.  
  
  ""Why do you say that?"" he asked, but looked cautious.  
  
  ""You just said that it's getting tiresome. If we can't get enough sleep at night, you should let us bring coffee. That's what I think.""  
  
  ""You shouldn't even be sharing your opinions, Miss Jeneve. You are supposed to be in the counselor's office.""  
  
  ""Yeah, well,"" I crossed my arms over my chest. ""I'm not going."" I raised my chin up and stared back, steadily.  
  
  Mr. Aldross stared at me and I knew he was wondering what he would do with me.  
  
  ""Then you may go to the principal's office,"" he quickly named his only other alternative.  
  
  I rolled my eyes and stood up. When I was at the door, Mr. Aldross commented, ""Please wait, Miss Jeneve.""  
  
  ""Changed your mind?""  
  
  ""May I please see your homework?""  
  
  ""I don't have time for that, Mr. Aldross. The principal needs to see me,"" I taunted him and dramatically threw open the door.  
  
  I hadn't gone a few steps before the door opened again and Leisha ran to catch up.  
  
  ""Hey,"" she gave me a tentative grin.  
  
  ""Mr. Aldross asked you to escort me?"" I asked, already knowing.  
  
  ""Yeah."" She ducked her head. ""Sorry.""  
  
  ""It's cool,"" I shrugged. ""I'm not going. You know that right?""  
  
  At my locker, I traded my books for my purse.  
  
  ""So are you skipping?"" She asked, her shoulders hunched.  
  
  I eyed her outfit again. The taffeta clung to her skin. She wore some type of tight khakis that were pinned to itself with large black buttons that ran up and down her legs. She almost looked like a naughty librarian.  
  
  ""Where'd you get that outfit?"" I asked.  
  
  ""What?"" Confusion crossed her face as she glanced down at herself. ""This?""  
  
  ""Yeah. Where'd you get that?""  
  
  ""Hot Topics. Why?"" She frowned.  
  
  ""It's cool. I like it."" And I did, I wasn't lying.  
  
  Just then the door opened again and Bryce strolled out. He grinned at the sight of us and moved to lean beside me.  
  
  ""Hey,"" he murmured.  
  
  ""Did he kick you out or send you after us?""  
  
  ""He's got his ass all twisted,"" Bryce commented.  
  
  ""Nice articulation,"" I joked and Bryce grinned ruefully.  
  
  I yawned a  
nd asked Bryce, ""Wanna go for coffee?""  
  
  Bryce frowned, but said, ""Sure.""  
  
  I eyed Leisha and asked, ""Wanna come?""  
  
  Her eyes widened.  
  
  I saw the glint of a smile at Bryce's mouth, but he just watched.  
  
  ""I shouldn't."" She shifted on her feet and glanced at the classroom door. ""I should go back. I mean, Mr. Aldross is expecting me.""  
  
  ""You're right."" I grinned wolfishly. ""You should go back.""  
  
  ""Um."" Her eyes glanced between Bryce and myself again, anxiously. And then she exclaimed, ""I'm going to go."" She disappeared down the hallway, but was back within a moment with a black purse tucked underneath her arm. And she looked nervous, very nervous.  
  
  I felt a pang of conscience and said, ""You don't have to come.""  
  
  She bit her lip and asked, ""What do you mean?""  
  
  ""Leisha, you're a good kid. Lying to a teach is not your forte. You can't really want to skip with us.""  
  
  ""I do. I really do,"" she insisted.  
  
  ""Okay."" I exchanged a look with Bryce. He raised an eyebrow, but that was the extent of his feedback. ""Let's go.""  
  
  Bryce took shotgun in my car and Leisha hopped in the back. She giggled as we left the parking lot and confided, ""You're right. This is the first time I've skipped school. I kinda like it. It's a rush.""  
  
  Bryce and I both chose to remain quiet on that matter.  
  
  When I pulled into the coffee shop, I informed Bryce, ""You're paying.""  
  
  ""What?"" Bryce asked. ""Why am I paying? We're not on a date.""  
  
  Leisha giggled behind her hands.  
  
  Maybe bringing her wasn't such a good idea.  
  
  ""You're paying because you're the man. Men buy things.""  
  
  ""And women put out?"" Bryce finished the sentiment and flashed a suggestive grin.  
  
  ""Exactly,"" I murmured and pushed inside. I wasn't serious, but I grinned a little at the Leisha's sudden intake of breath.  
  
  She hesitated at the door when Bryce held it open for her. ""Girls first."" Bryce ushered her inside with a hand at her back.  
  
  Leisha looked like a deer in headlights.  
  
  The clerk frowned at us, but filled our orders. I moved to study the magazines when Bryce dropped onto one of the couches. After we'd gotten our coffee, we sat there in silence. Bryce leaned back and closed his eyes. Leisha watched Bryce, shyly, and then nibbled at her nails when she looked to me. And I drank my coffee while I watched her. I almost felt sorry, she was out of her league and she knew it.  
  
  When the door's bell jingled, Bryce sat up and bumped his knee into mine.  
  
  ""What?"" I asked and he gestured towards the front door.  
  
  It was Mena and Denton.  
  
  Mena had a glazed look in her eyes and Denton looked bored.  
  
  I remembered the blank look that had been on her face when I first left for school.  
  
  ""Do you guys know them?"" Leisha asked and then gasped. ""That's Denton Steele.""  
  
  ""They're weird, Sheldon."" Bryce murmured and leaned for his drink.  
  
  I was starting to agree.  
  
  ""Oh my god. Do you guys know them?"" Leisha pressed again, eagerly. All her virgin-blushes and awkwardness was gone now. The presence of a celebrity could work so many miracles.  
  
  ""Something like that,"" I murmured and plastered a warm smile on my face when Denton noticed us. He did a double-take, but left Mena's side. Mena remained at the counter.  
  
  ""Hey, Sheldon."" Denton flashed a smooth grin my way and took the seat beside mine.  
  
  Bryce leaned back and watched underneath his eyelids.  
  
  ""Skipping school?"" Denton managed to condemn and flirt with me at the same time.  
  
  ""I have first period free,"" I lied smoothly.  
  
  ""Really?"" He raised his eyebrows.  
  
  ""Hi."" Leisha stuck her hand out. ""I'm Leisha Summers.""  
  
  ""Hi."" Denton turned celebrity in a flash.  
  
  ""Can I have your autograph?""  
  
  ""Sure."" He winked at me. ""Sheldon, do you want an autograph?""  
  
  I looked at him coolly and murmured, ""I think I gave you my autograph.""  
  
  ""Oh right."" He flexed his back and added, ""I never knew nail marks stung so much.""  
  
  Mena sat beside Leisha at that moment and handed a drink to her brother.  
  
  Denton dropped the celebrity façade and turned into big brother immediately. It was impressive.  
  
  ""Thanks, Mena,"" he said softly.  
  
  She ignored him and gazed at me. ""Hey, Sheldon.""  
  
  ""Hi, Mena.""  
  
  She glanced warily at Bryce. Her eyes lingered a moment and Bryce raised an eyebrow when he looked at me.  
  
  Denton's jaw clenched. He thrust a hand out, ""We didn't meet yesterday. I'm Denton.""  
  
  ""Bryce,"" Bryce grunted as he shook hands.  
  
  ""Did you guys get your friend out of jail?""  
  
  Bryce and I both grinned and enjoyed the startled looks on Leisha and Mena's faces.  
  
  ""Sure did."" Bryce lifted his cup in a salute.  
  
  ""Who was in jail?"" Mena asked.  
  
  ""A friend,"" I answered and switched the topic, ""So, Mena, you're not going to school today?""  
  
  Denton frowned and answered first, ""She's not feeling well today.""  
  
  ""Looks fine to me,"" Bryce commented.  
  
  ""Looks fine to me,"" I repeated.  
  
  Mena gave her brother a forced smile and said tightly, ""I'm feeling fine, but Denton thinks he felt a fever coming on.""  
Coffee's a good antidote,"" Bryce deadpanned.  
  
  Denton scowled his way, but recovered almost immediately.  
  
  Bryce and I both caught it and shared a look. I shifted in my seat and introduced, ""Mena, this is Leisha. Leisha, this is Mena. Mena's first day was yesterday at our school.""  
  
  ""Oh really? I don't remember seeing you."" Leisha said warmly. I enjoyed her naiveté.  
  
  ""So why was your friend in jail?"" Denton said abruptly. I don't think he enjoyed the naiveté.  
  
  I ignored him and murmured, ""Mena, do you have a fever now?""  
  
  ""No,"" she said quickly.  
  
  ""See? Coffee heals anything,"" Bryce said easily, but kept his eyes on Denton, alert.  
  
  ""Look, man, I was concerned for my sister. What's your problem?"" Denton bit out and flexed his hands.  
  
  ""I think I skipped my second day when I started high school too."" I laughed and shifted in my seat, getting comfortable.  
  
  Denton caught the insult and glared at me. ""You're a real bitch, you know that?""  
  
  ""Me?"" I asked innocently, fighting a smile.",1,1749371875.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I stopped eating junk foods. Instead of chips I switched it to papayas, apples, bananas, oranges and common fruits I can find except grapes.

I stopped drinking my fave coffee and switched to green teas (non caffe,) mint teas and chamomile tea, water and cucumber drink.

I stopped playing my favorite intense games. I switched to cozy games - those that makes me yawn games.

I stopped sleeping late at night and opt to sleep for 7hrs before work in the morning.

I stopped being  workaholic, and do what I can always do just for a day. Take holidays and use that leave to pamper myself.

I stopped associating to dramas by the people around me- be it work or some fake friends. I started learning to treasure myself more and those people that who truly loves me.

I stopped scrolling on my phone upon waking up and started light walking, taichi and yoga instead.

I think I stopped alot of things more than I started a new one, but this is now my new normal. I hoped I've given ideas to some people who have the same HBP anxiety like myself. We can do this. We can regain our health back to the way we started this life. I'm looking forward to the new me after this disease.

1l67ck3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1l67ck3/a_perfect_apple_shortcut_for_brewing_using_v60/,A perfect Apple shortcut for brewing using V60 with Tetsu Kasuya method,"**tl;dr**  
I created an Apple shortcut that helps to brew coffee using Tetsu Kasuya's 40:60 method using a V60

Link to the shortcut: [**V60 Brew**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3448c39111444559987a624f4ad34bd2)

# Background:

After starting my coffee brewing journey with a Bialetti Moka pot, I learned that dripping methods like pourover will give you more flavourful coffee especially for lighter roasts. Soon I learned about the V60 brewing method by Tetsu Kasuya (aka the 40:60 method) that won him the 2016 World Brewers Cup. It’s actually an amazing method where you can get different outcomes from the same coffee beans by controlling size and number of pours.

# Challenge:

When I’m brewing my first cup in the morning I would absolutely hate having to calculate the amount of water and the size of pours. That and having to track the brew with a stopwatch.

# Solution:

I spent way too much time on creating and perfecting this shortcut but the end-goal is extremely satisfying. Now I have to simply enter the amount of coffee I’ve ground, and then choose how I want the taste and strength, and it will automatically calculate the number and size of pours, run the stopwatch and track 45 seconds for each pour using laps. 

# How to use it:

This shortcut is created based on this V60 [**guide**](https://en.philocoffea.com/blogs/blog/hario-v60-beginner-brewing-guide).

Simply add this to your Apple Shortcuts, and run it.

It will ask you the amount of ground coffee in grams that you will be brewing. Then you first choose between three options of taste and then you choose between three options of strength of your cup.(so total nine possibilities!)  
Then it will simply instruct you the size of the first pour. After you pour, you confirm it and then it runs the stopwatch. After 45 seconds it will alert you for the next pour and what size it has to be, and so on. It will also automatically lap the times in your stopwatch.

That’s it! Now you can try this amazing method without having to do any calculations in your morning groggy state. Hope this shortcut helps others like me! Let me know if you have any questions :)

**P.S.** Do watch Tetsu Kasuya’s presentation of his 40:60 V60 method that won him the championship [**here**](https://youtu.be/yw849fABP54?si=b016LkTIwJrplcJY).",10,1749371591.0,IndiaCoffee,12,0.92,False

* [Guruwalk Free Walking Tour](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/45627-first-guru-in-taiwan-taipei-old-town-free-taiwan-introduction-tour)
   * Already goes to places like Peace Memorial Park, Zhongshan Hall, Ximending, Red House Theater, Presidential Office.
   * Gives amazing insight on the current state of Taiwan, its history and current day conflicts and interests and perspective of the locals
* Ximending Night Market

Day 2: 

* Full Day Typical Taipei Tour -- Yehliu Geopark, Shifen Old Street, Jiufen, and a Pastry Making activity at the end
   * When someone goes to Taiwan, this is probably their IG story 99% of the time LOL.
   * Personally, I think it is one of the most overrated places I have been. Geopark is just a bunch of weird rocks and there's so many people. Shifen Old Street (the lantern thing) is meh. I just did it for brownie points even though I don't believe in luck or some feng shui stuff. Jiufen has overpriced food and just jampacked by people with one of the worst restaurants I've been to. The guide wanted us to see the houses from the bus but it's literally like Baguio -- to the point that Filipinos at the bus are just smirking, *""We got that back home.""*
   * I still think it's OK if you want to go there. I would suggest getting the tour instead of doing it by yourself if you do not have time and you are with many people. It should be cheaper and easier.
* Night Markets

Day 3: Taichung

* Bullet train from Taipei to Taichung
* National Museum of Natural Science
   * amazing museum with a theater! There are different sections to the museum and some tickets can only get you to specific sections. Mas maganda yung moving dinosaur nila dito kesa dun sa nakita ko sa UK na may santa hat LOL.
   * You can spend half a day here! You hop on a bus from the train station to the museum
* Zhongshe Flower Market / Farm
   * Rented a cab to get here
   * Ito yung pinopost ng kakilala mong nag Taiwan na may piano sa gitna ng mga bulaklak
   * During March, the flowers are in full bloom too! Amazing sights and not too crowded IMO so you can take your sweet time to get the photos you want.
   * There is a hotpot / kbbq style restaurant inside. Sobrang funny kumain dito. Free-for-all buffet style. Hindi ko na maalala pero libre na yata yung entrance mo sa flower farm pag kumain ka dito. Do not quote me on that. But I'd say do it before or after the flower farm kasi mag aamoy usok ka!
* Just get back to the train station before it closes. The stations here are ""weird"" and Taichung is a little bit difficult to navigate.

Day 4: Stroll around Taipei

* Supposed to be a day trip to Tainan but the ticket prices are so high and I was a bit tired.
* Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall, Peace Park, Walk around Taipei 101 (since I don't want to go up there due to *strong acrophobia)*
* Chill day at the parks, night market

Day 5: Maokong Gondola + Taipei Zoo

* Taipei Zoo
   * large zoo with pandas! i think the zoo is pretty good. however, it is quite cold and there were some drizzles. it is at a mountain after all. you probably need a jacket
* Maokong and Maokong Gondola
   * short cable car to Maokong. there are some cute tea and coffee shops at the top. then you can take the bus back to the city. the terrain is rough tho so I'd suggest take the seat if you can (but they are quite limited). it's difficult to stand with all the curvy roads.
* Raohe Night Market
   * arguably way better than Ximending Night Market -- more choices, better food, a little less people.

Day 6: Flight to Hongkong

* I booked a cruise (Aqualuna Victoria Harbour Experience) but ended up not using it.
* I just walked around the neighborhood because I was anxious. Yesterday, I got a call from home that my dog is sick and needs medical attention. So I was just planning which clinic they should bring my dog for a second diagnosis.

Day 7: Hongkong City Proper

* [Guruwalk Free Walking Tour](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/35070-introduction-of-hong-kong-by-hong-kong-free-tours)
   * Brings you to places like St. John's Cathedral, Wellington Street, Man Mo Temple, Central-Mid Levels Escalator, etc.
   * Also has recommendations where to eat. I ate at one restaurant with a wanton noodle soup beside a jampacked Michelin restaurant. Our guide told me it's just as good, if not better.
* Victoria Peak and Tram
   * Lots of people but the tram uphill was pretty quick. Roaming around Victoria Peak at sunrise time is also breathtaking. You can also do Madame Tussaud here.
   * You can take the bus to go back to the city center

Day 8: Lantau Island and Tai-O Fishing Village

* There's a cable car to *Ngong Ping* *Village*. I suggest get the ticket online since it's faster. But the queue is quite long so you need some patience.
* The stairs to the Big Buddha is steep and there's a lot of stairs. I think the view is pretty good from above tho. So it's worth walking. There are some more temples and eateries in there.
* After that, you take the bus to Tai-O Fishing Village where you can ride a small boat that roams around the village. There is a chance to see a pink dolphin based on the posters but they said it was rare.
* Get and eat some food and fish balls at some stalls nearby.
* Get the bus to Mui Wo from Central Pier and take the ferry back to Central Hongkong. 

Day 9: Roam Around the City but...

* I had plans to go to Macau but today is the day my dog will be brought to a vet for some diagnosis. I was very anxious about it so I decided not to go and just roam around the city.
* I went to *Hongkong Science Museum.* The museum is pretty cool and has a lot of interactive spaces. If you have kids or teenagers who love science, I'd say go here. 
* However, while I was at the museum, I got a call from my siblings that my dog was suffering heatstroke due to the vet clinic's negligence. I had a 2 hour call with them while they were attending to my dog til my dog died of cardiac arrest due to this incident.
* It was one of the most devastating day of my life and til this day, I can vividly remember where I was sitting during that two hour call. I rushed back to the hostel while also arranging the funeral service for my dog. They can only hold them for a day at max. I was supposed to have another day tomorrow and fly midnight. But I need to go back home to take care of the funeral service for my dog and arrange it.
* I booked a cab, went to the ATM to get money to pay for the cab, and booked a flight while on the way to the airport. It was the worst airplane ride I had in my life. I think I was just in shock the whole time so I never shed any tears until I went back home to see my dogs with one of them missing. I thought everything was a dream until it hit me.

Day 10:

* I was supposed to go around Hongkong and see places like Chungking Mansions (one of the inspirations why I want to go to Hongkong since I just watched some Wong Kar Wai films and you will notice that some photos have that Wong Kar Wai aesthetic to it). 
* But I was attending my dog's funeral back home.

Things were never the same after this. I didn't travel for almost 6 months (I usually travel every 3 months). And the next airplane rides until now are making me anxious --  a feeling I never felt before. Now, thoughts like plane crashes or not being able to go back for my dogs are haunting me. I also had another dog before die while I wasn't able to go to the vet due to COVID. So now, I try to make sure that I am always around them whenever they need a vet visit.

So yeah, *Hongkong* will carry those memories. But aside from this, I felt like Hongkong is full of facade. I talked to people and they told me I got the exact words they wanted to describe Hongkong. Hidden from the skyscrapers were large wealth inequalities and people struggling, and an impossible cost of living for locals.

But to continue with the trip report...

**Highlights / Notes / Tips**

* I think the best part of the Taiwan trip itinerary was Taichung. I feel like Taiwan is more enjoyable outside Taipei. Probably doesn't help that I have went to Japan twice already so Taipei felt like a downgrade. But it still has its charm
* The Lantau Island escapade in Hongkong is pretty doable and amazing too. 
* Probably the main highlight for Hongkong is that their food is way better than Taiwan. They have overlapping cuisines but Taiwanese food are bland and has less sugar. I think it's just their diet and health considerations. I like my Chinese cuisine/food with more spice and flavor to it. However, they are hella more expensive
* Hongkong has a lot of slopes. It isn't flat. So wear proper shoes because it is more challenging to walk around. You will not notice this at first until your legs start to feel heavier than usual.
* Both Hongkong and Taiwan (Taipei specifically) are great for solo travellers -- Taiwan is cheaper and is easy to navigate with interconnected lines and buses. Hongkong is quite expensive tho and I felt like it is more expensive than Japan and maybe just a little more expensive than Singapore (or atleast on par).
* You need Octopus card for Hongkong and whatever card Taiwan needs (I forgot lol)
* One thing I missed and wanted to do was the spring baths in Taipei. I think you should try it!
* You can skip the Yehliu-Shifen tour. But it's also fine if you want to do it. 
* I think GCash now works in Taiwan/Hongkong but you should double check.
* Late March is quite hot and humid already for both countries. I suggest going slightly earlier (i.e. late February or March). I missed the slightly colder weather which ended the week before my arrival.
* Both are quite friendly to Filipino tourists but they are both fed up with noisy Filipinos so you will see some signages in Filipino. Maybe just pretend you are Thai LOL.
* There is actually a (nonsensical) queue at the bus stations in Hongkong. I didn't know this and one lady just got angry at me for standing at the start unknowingly. She wanted me to go to the back. Funnily enough, when the first bus arrived I was the only one who went aboard LOL.

**Five Pillars of a Great Travel Ratings (I will just combine them)**

* **History, People, and Culture (3/5):** Interesting culture but modernity has replaced a lot of its roots. I think it's more interesting to know what they are up to in these modern times. People are fine. I wouldn't say they are as friendly as Filipinos/Thais/Viets but they are quite cold. Hongkongers can be a little colder.
* **Food (3/5) for Taiwan, (3.75/5) for Hongkong.** I love Chinese food but I think Taiwanese food is bland for my taste. Hongkong has better flavor profiles and more suited to my taste. However, it is quite expensive.
* **Landscapes, Attractions, and Landmarks (2.75/5)**. Hongkong's most popular thing is DisneyLand which I dont really go to as a solo traveller anymore. Many of the attractions are also man-made. I am tired of theme parks when I am travelling solo. Taipei's attractions are also OK. I think Taiwan's scenery is better if you go outside Taipei. I love Taipei's parks tho.
* **Uniqueness and Variety (2/5):**  The two countries are quite similar and the variety isn't that big for me.
* **Affordability (**4.5/5) Taiwan, **(2/5)** Hongkong. Hongkong is pretty expensive -- food, accommodation, activities. However, the flight is cheaper so I didnt give it a 1 out of 5. Taiwan is pretty affordable with cheap flights, stays, and food. However, they are not as cheap as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.",18,1749371470.0,phtravel,2,0.88,False

1l67a4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1l67a4v/i_tried_to_court_a_close_friend_we_went_out_for/,"I tried to court a close friend. We went out for about 4 months, but now we're just friends again.","Problem/Goal: I tried to court a friend who I'd known since college. We had a fight and she decided to end it. We're still in good terms and are still friends. Is it too much to ask if I tried to court her again - not now, but in the future? And how can I make her fall for me?

Context: She and I were classmates during college. We were always part of the same group, during internship, projects, and thesis. As I became close to her I slowly realized she had a great personality. Apparently it was obvious to our friends that I had a crush on her so they were pushing me to confess. After our graduation I had the chance to hang out with her and this continued with us inviting each other. I confessed to her on one of our outings and asked if I can court her. She said she was okay with me, but she couldn't really give me an answer right now. This continued for another 4 months with us going to coffee shops, malls, and walking outside at least once a week. I decided to ask her again if I can court her. Again she said she couldn't give me an answer. This really hit me, I mean, we were already spending time together regularly, so I thought she would have an answer by then. Then somebody in my family passed away, and I was really depressed because it was someone I was really close with. In our group chat with friends, everyone was joking around. Then, out of nowhere, the girl I wanted to court directed a joke at me. I was really offended and messaged her privately about it. She replied, saying she didn’t mean to be hurtful. I thought there were no problems because we were still talking after that. I messaged her again if she was upset about what I said but she didn't respond. I wanted to apologize but she answered me with silence. Her silence added to my depression. I started questioning everything—especially whether I should continue courting her. So I messaged her again, asking why it was taking so long for her to decide if I could court her. Still, no response. The next day, I really lost control of my emotions. I sent her a message asking why she didn’t just reject me from the start. She finally replied and told me to stop having feelings for her. I apologized and even begged her to fix things between us, but she simply said no. We didn’t message each other for two weeks. Then, she messaged me asking how I was. We had small conversations after that, but there were no feelings attached. A month after our fight we went to one of our friend's house. When it was our time to go home I offered to take her home - she accepted. I gave her a letter about my feelings, how I realized how I liked her and how important she was to me now. She responded to me with a chat the next day. She said, she knows that my feelings were real, and she understood that I was emotional at the time. She said she hoped I was okay and she thinks it would be better if we proceeded as friends.",1,1749371307.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

I had the opportunity to study here, and that itself,  living abroad, especially in one of the most open cities like Berlin, was more challenging than the studying itself. I went to one of the most liberal colleges, which introduced me to many new ideologies, cultures, and languages. For that, I am thankful. But it was not during those times that I really understood something deeper, until I met a girl.

We started our relationship by sleeping together on the first day. It was not a date, just a friend’s meeting at a bar. That relationship lasted two years. I had never experienced being with a German girl before. But something unexpected, some kind of lust in me, led me to mess up that two-year relationship. It has been eight months since then. I feel like the dating process has changed, or maybe I am just seeing it differently now. Everything feels much faster. Just hookups. So many types. High expectations, maybe. I have been trying to meet someone, not desperate for sex, but hoping to hang out and take things slowly, because my last relationship started with sex.

This is what I have been going through. I do not know if it is a curse on me or if it is just part of the breakup consequences. I wonder sometimes if I am the only one who has gone through this. I have been trying to talk to people, to approach them. I do have enough confidence to start something, but when it comes to taking it a little further, it does not work.

I work out. I take care of myself and my body. I eat healthily. I am not stuck in the past, but I carry it with me. I’d be glad to hear your thoughts. If anyone in Berlin relates, I’m open to a good conversation, even just over coffee

I studied the glow of the sun as it bounced off of the myriad of photographs along my stairwell. Faces of people I had met and grown up with. Imperfect as they were, memories with them seemed ever more sentimental as my years crept on. Seemingly I was going to fall behind myself, making memories wasn't easy when you were spending all your waking hours studying.

The creaking of steps, the grains of wood –real wood, not that cheap stuff– under my hand as I descended to the ground floor. My books were heavy enough to dislocate my shoulder, but I could manage.

""Put the books down, Judy. We need to talk."" Forest stared me down, he looked ready for battle, crew-cut and all. He sat at the kitchen table, in uniform as he did most days.

""Will this take long?"" I asked. My 18 or so pounds of textbooks and essays shaking the table as I set them down. Forest held his drink steady as I seated myself.

""Approximately 2 minutes."" he tapped his watch.

""Right. This should be good."" I shuffled impatiently.

He twisted his drink around a few times, watching the liquid reach either side of the glass.

""I'm being sent to South America.""

""When?"" I interlaced my fingers, trying to hold the crack in my voice.

""This afternoon. It's unprecedented and under strict confidentiality."" he hadn't looked me in the eyes yet.

""So…non-negotiable, then?"" I searched for a way into his mind, maybe a touch from my hand.

""Six weeks, tops. I promise.""

""I've heard that before."" I began to collect my things, he put a gentle hand on my shoulder.

""31 years I've known you, Judy. You know me too, right? When I'm finished with this one, we can take a break; just you and me."" he smiled. I hoped it looked like I was smiling too.

""I trust you. Just, please come back."" these missions were never easy for me, I'd hoped in time his age would've convinced him of a less taxing occupation. Nevertheless, it wouldn't be long now.

""I love you, Judy Lancaster.""

""I love you too, Forest.""

Mt. Erebus. Year 1966.

""Audio Log. April 17th, 1966. Satellite Units 221-3490 display negative accounts of external activity. Will continue to monitor."" he lowered the recording device and sat back in his chair with a laboured exhale.

""Nothing?"" similarly placed in a chair not 6 feet away was his squadmate Usul, they'd been recording and monitoring 'nothing' for what felt like years.

""Same as last time, and same as every fucking day."" he placed his feet up on the desk. ""And the day before that, and the day before that…""

""And the day before that, right up til' day one…"" Usul reminisced.

""Fourteen months of silence."" he pulled his cap over his eyes. Sleep was the only thing they could really do, besides wager cigarettes and meal vouchers.

""Whattya suppose they're making us listen for?"" Usul leaned forward, fiddling with a deck of cards.

""Don't know, don't care, I don't want to end up like that Antarctica crew up North. The whole place, gone just like that, no survivors, no explanation."" he squirmed, trying to ease into a good sleeping position.

""Better there than in 'Nam, I suppose…"" Usul shuffled the cards sheepishly.

""I could do with some action. Even if it's meaningless capital warfare, I'd run the slog every day if it meant never making back to this shit."" 

A moment of understanding sat between them. As brutal as war was, they'd wagered being killed in battle would look better than a manic overdose of cabin fever.

""Y'hear we're not winning?"" Usul looked for a reaction.

""Yeah, I know. All the more reason we should be there, not watching a bunch of numbers do nothing day in and day out."" he scoffed, tired of his own complaints.

Usul went back to practicing his card skills, only to be interrupted by an unfamiliar resonance from some of the satellite dishes.

""Hey Tags, what's this flashing one mean?"" he pointed to the ever-growing frequency.

Tags stood from his chair and stared at the reading for a few seconds.

""Fuck if I know. Is it extraterrestrial?"" he turned sharply, his tags clicking from the momentum.

""Too strong by the looks of it, but it's definitely not supposed to be there."" Usul smacked his playing cards on the table and made way to the radio relay.

""Hello? Yes, this is Lieutenant Usul of Mt. Erebus satellite array, I'm requesting immediate communication with General Harvey."" he looked at his friend, then back at the dials in front of him.

""I think we got something.""

Vancouver Island University, Canada. Year 2029.

""He'll be alright, he always is."" I massaged the ring around my finger, never bothered to break the habit.

""You almost finished with your thesis?"" Leroy handed me my 3rd coffee of the afternoon.

""I hope so, I think I want to hibernate after all this is over."" I sipped the warm coffee, relieving some of my high-strung symptoms.

""Hey, I have a biology question."" Leroy sat across from me, typing away at some indescribable engineering gibberish I didn't know.

""Shoot."" I said, still flipping through the references I'd picked up earlier in the week. 

""Do you think humans are like…ants?"" he asked half-heartedly.

I paused. The question was so vague, how was I supposed to synthesize a response to cover something of this scale?

""You mean, as in are we influenced by pheromones and controlled by a singular individual who also happens to birth all of our children? It's a little far-fetched."" I raised my eyebrow, as there was bound to be more to this rogue thought.

""Like, in the grand scheme of things…do you think there's a creature out there who thinks we're ants?"" he seemed more direct than before, however it didn't make the scenario less desirable.

""Possibly, if there was something big enough. In that case, sure."" I shrugged. Something big enough to perceive us as that small would be theoretically impossible, but it was interesting nonetheless. Few had tried to describe it before, but it was relegated to the works of fiction, nothing more.

""What about, like, a secret queen?"" he looked up from his typing to see if I paid attention.

""Leroy, I have to finish this thesis by the end of next week."" I gave the expression of annoyance, enough to dissuade any further questions.

""No no! Last question, I swear."" he raised his hands slightly. 

""Fine, last question."" I tried not to stare too judgingly.

""I mean, what if there's a bunch of queens living underground or something. Like the ants we see are just super miniversions of us, but our queens are just hiding where we can't see them. Secretly controlling our actions like a weird pheromone kingdom."" he splayed out his arms, clearly satisfied with his scenario.

""Again, far-fetched. Ant queens can't control all the ants at once, it's more like an ocean of chemicals. All she really does is make waves, literally and figuratively."" I went back to my work, with all I'd accumulated there was not much left to do besides make the final edits to my printed rubrics.

""Like radio waves?"" he pushed, hands fully off the keyboard.

""No more questions Leroy, you agreed. I have to get this done."" I didn't look back after that, my final iteration was more important than a conversation about ant colonies. I preferred bacteria, anyway.

Manaus, Brazil. Year 2029.

""I hate bugs."" Forest swatted another small insect trying to approach his face.

""You'll learn to love 'em, over the rest of the crazy bastards in these woods."" the Sergeant continued to lead the way.

""We're almost there."" the navigator indicated.

""Keep your weapons hot, people! This is not a mission for mistakes."" he held up the party, awating the right moment to strike.

""There! Just past the bush line."" the navigator pinged the location.

Forest could barely make out what was ahead, a clearing of some sort; it looked unnaturally well-kept to be a burn site or sub-terrain boulder.

""Steel your nerves, men. We mustn't fail, for the safety of our own."" the sergeant readied his weapons, alongside the rest of the platoon.

Forest thought of Judy in that moment. Whatever was out here would never reach her, he would make sure of it.
As they pushed the treeline, each one of them fell in line, guns at the ready and awaiting command. 

Forest paused. His gun was poised and on target, yet he peeled his finger away from the trigger.

""What the fuck?"" he told himself internally, but the expression was written all over his face.

Standing in front of him –not two feet from the end of his gun– was a member of a native tribe. A middle-aged man, sage and curiously unphased by the threat of Forest's weapon.

""Fire!"" the sergeant yelled.

Forest didn't even have time to process the instance. The native man's face lit up with a terror of recognition, seemingly less to do with the gun but of who was firing it.

""Vocês são eles."" he gasped. Before the barrage of high-caliber rounds pierces his worn and painted body.

The entire population of this small alcove of people was reduced to ruin within the hour. All houses burned, offspring destroyed, and effigies torn to rubble.

""Burn all the bodies, but do not touch them. Do you understand?"" the sergeant's words felt like shards of ice in Forest's mind.

""Y-yessir."" the ordeal had shaken him, and made his skin crawl. Only this time, it felt like his skin was literally writhing, his whole body was shifting with discomfort.

He ran to the nearest shrub and emptied his stomach of whatever it may have contained.

""Get him out of here."" the sergeant barked.

""You alright, my friend?"" another soldier asked.

""I'll be alright…I think…"" Forest paused briefly. ""Hey, do you speak uhh…Portuguese?""

""Sure, I've learned a phrase or two."" he adjusted his helmet to give his ears room.

""What does 'Vocês são eles' mean?"" he repeated with amateur pronunciation. 

""Hm…that doesn't really make sense. Are you sure that's what you heard?"" he glanced at Forest in mild confusion.

""I'm sure."" Forest replied shakily.

""Heh- well if you're sure, then it sounds like you-"" he was cut off by the sergeant.

""We're done here, let's move people!"" all the soldiers followed suit. Forest managed to get a look at the small plume of black smoke rising above the trees before the disappeared into the jungle.

""Okay, smartass, I actually need the phone so can you stop messing around?"" Usul jutted to his comrade.

""I didn't do nothing! I'm just trying to get these readings sorted."" he turned back to the panel that was now blaring incomprehensibly.

""Ugh! Work, damn you!"" he slammed the phone down in frustration. ""Great! We're cut off, the signal must be interfering with all our equipment!""

""Where's the rest of the crew?"" Tags asked, still looking at the dials.

""Sleeping, what the fuck else would they be doing?"" Usul started to lose his nerve. ""I'll go check anyway.""

""Wait! Look at this…"" Tags pointed to the frequency gauge.

Usul walked over, steam was practically pouring out of his ears. The demeanour dropped immediately upon looking at the monitor.

""Usul, I think…""

""Tags. Tags it's getting closer!"" Usul backed away.

""We're dead…"" Tags mumbled. ""That's-…we're all dead.""

""Don't say that, Tags! We need to wake everyone up! Right the fuck now, Tags!"" Usul ran for the soldiers' quarters. One of the eighty or so personnel must know how to resolve this.

Usul grabbed the fire alarm and pulled it down hard enough for it to snap right off. The siren blared, awakening any poor soldier within earshot.

""Get up everyone! This is not a drill!"" Usul tried to get everyone awake and at the ready. Whatever weapons they had, resources, ammunition, medical supplies. 

Whatever was coming, it was just eighty lackeys and a deck of cards between the outsider and the rest of the world.

""Four-hundred meters from topside!"" Tags called out. The readings were unintelligible at this point, yet he couldn't look away.
""We gotta stop it!"" Usul grabbed one of the long guns and headed for the door, a frostbite mask over his face.

""Usul wait! Your radio!"" Tags threw it from the desk, unable to stop him but ensuring they could still hear from him.

""If you're gonna face this, you need to keep at each checkpoint by name! You can do this Usul, give 'em hell!"" Tags had no idea what Usul would find out there. Nobody did. 

All they could do was pray.

""Forest, is everything okay?"" I spoke worriedly, I tried not to make it sound that way, I tried. ""Please, tell me what's going on.""

""J-Judy, I need to tell you something. Not right now, though."" Forest was tired and audibly dishevelled.

""Please, tell me where you are. I'll come pick you up."" I felt the tears coming down, I was such a crybaby. Obviously he just needed time to adjust back into civilian life. I just couldn't shake the feeling he needed me right then and there.

""Okay. If you want to come get me, I'll be waiting by our favorite spot."" he hung up.

""What is going on…"" I whispered. The tears slowed somewhat, and I grabbed my keys.

""I have to find him.""

""Checkpoint 'HORUS'"" Usul exclaimed over the radio.

""Godspeed, Usul."" Tags whispered.

North Strathcona, Canada. Year 2029.

He handed me an old photograph, two men posing in front of a fishing lake.

""This was my father in '59."" he explained. ""See his arm there.""

Forest pointed to a long scar on his father's arm.

""He got that nasty thing fighting a barbed wire fence when he was 15.""

""Honey, what does this have to do with anything?"" I wanted to make sure he was alright, the photo could hopefully wait.

""Just, let me explain."" he rolled back the leg of his pants on one side.

""See the resemblance?"" he pointed. The wrapping pattern and divets were almost exactly the same.

""Now, this is a picture of my mother, in '58."" he handed over another photo. Her portrait was elegant, minus a star-like birth mark on her jawline.

""And see here."" he lifted his shirt halfway to show his back. His hands were shaking, but he pointed to a similarly –no –perfectly matching star-like birthmark.

""I've seen this mark before, hun. So you inherited a few traits, I just need to know you're okay."" I clasped his hands, hoping to snap him out of it.

""Judy, it's more than that. Swear to me that you'll never repeat what I'm about to tell you."" he leaned intensely, not a waft of irony in his words.

""I…I swear, Forest.""

""Hey! I forgot to tell you before."" the helpful soldier turned to face Forest, the sound of the helicopter's rotors eating through the headphones.

""About what?"" Forest replied.

""The phrase you heard!"" he yelled.

""Oh, yeah! What does it mean?""

'You are them.'

""That's what the strange man said to you?"" I didn't want to display my frustration, but I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

""My father and mother, half and half. Or so it goes."" he began. ""Don't you see, it's wrong. Too literal. I got half of his traits, and half of hers.""

""I..I don't understand. Genetics can recreate things like this, if your mother had a birthmark then-""

""Yes, but a perfect recreation of her birthmark? And born with a scar the same length and pattern as my father. What about your mother? She had an ear surgery, right? Took a part of it clean off."" he leaned further in, so as to not catch attention.

""Forest, you're scaring me."" was this the man I married? Or just some creature from the jungle?

""See, your ear."" he felt it in his hand, contemplating.

""My father never fought in the war. He was stationed somewhere else."" he explained.

""Right, he was stationed in the South Pole."" I tried to follow as best I could.

""That night at the station. They picked up a signal. Something deep inside the circle."" his eyes were wide. ""Never seen anything like it, it just kept getting closer. My dad's friend went outside to strike first…""

""You'd think we would have heard something of that scale, Forest."" I told him. He wasn't listening anymore.

""There had been stories about what happened to a station close to the circle. Crew of 12, lost contact and not 48 hours later the whole place goes up. That was only a few days before the signal started…""

""Do you know what happened to them?"" I asked, sheepishly.

""They got sent home after the airforce was able to reach the base."" Forest seemed distraught by this information.

""It should have stayed in the ice, Judy."" tears began to fall from his eyes.

""Oh no,  it's alright Forest. It's not your fault."" I hugged him lightly, wiping the tears.

""Yes, it is."" he said, drearily. ""I killed them. They were all we had left.""

""The natives?"" I looked up at his reddened eyes.

""They weren't like us, Judy. Everyone we know –even if we can't remember –even if there is no need to be like it once was…"" he paused, looking for a way out.

""What are we, Forest?"" I didn't stop hugging, I wouldn't let go.

""We are they, from that night. It came home with them."" he broke down in tears. ""It looked just like him, they wouldn't have known. None of us knew.""

""That was over fifty years ago, Forest. Your father is gone, but you're still here. I'm here, too.""

""It's everything now. We look like them. Sound like them. Act like them. But for who? We are all of it now, Judy. There is no Forest, no Judy, only that…that…"" he trailed off, he couldn't stop shaking.

""That thing?"" I looked him in the eyes, but he was thousands of miles away.

""Does it matter? Doing it all now? Who are we pretending for, anymore?"" he couldn't bear to touch me anymore, placing his arms around himself.

""When I killed him, they told us not to touch the body. The last real humans, despite everything. I killed them Judy. I wanted to…to make them part of us.""

""If that's true, then you did better than what many of us would, Forest.""

""You're the same as me, Judy. Same as everyone we know. The animals, the germs, the trees…"" he shook at the thought.

""And…now?"" I leaned forward, my tears –if they were even real –on full display.

""How many times do you think this has happened?"" he whispered, convicted, resigned, assimilated.

""Usul?"" Tags said over the radio. The rest of the crew were dead silent, they'd killed the sound of the frequency in order to focus.

An array of static, occasionally broken by the frozen wind.

""Confirm checkpoint 'MARCO'?"" Tags inputted again.

""Usul! Confirm checkpoint 'MARCO'"" he pleaded.

""Please! Tell me you made it to 'MARCO'!""

""MARCO!""

No response. 

Tags put a hand to his mouth.

A loud thud landed on the outside door. The inner wheel turned slowly, until Usul shambled inside followed by a gust of wind.

""Usul! You missed the checkpoint! How did you–"" Tags stopped dead. His stomach turned sharply, the feeling of unease was thick.

He stumbled down the stairs, covered in snow. His gun had been fired, but not reloaded. Patches of snow fell from his body, his arms nearly limp at his sides.

""Usul? Say something! Why didn't you check in at 'MARCO'?"" one of the crew spoke up.

Usul straightened awkwardly, and pulled the protective goggles from his face, then the frostbite mask. His face was all distorted, unfit for the appearance it was attempting to mold itself into.

""Usul…"" Tags said, raising a loaded pistol shakily towards him.

""M-MARCO…""

It inhaled as if to speak, not quite perfecting the sound that a human is supposed to make. Only the faint and somewhat unintelligible formulation of phonetics escaped in a short and nauseating sound.
