Part 21.2- Bear with me ,"This Series is sister to ""Steel Valkyries"", which technically takes place before the events of ""Siren Thesis"", all within a cluster of branches where the Sirens have decided to undertake inland incursions.

Summary

The Commander has found himself at the research facility, along with some of his friends and people from his inner circle within Azur Lane, but no matter how much more information each one brings, more questions are brought up. Especially the questions regarding the misterious bear rigging, which they have yet to ascertain who it belongs to or when they might have arrived to the base. Those questions remain unclear until Chkalov decides to make some time and give a -brief- explanation of what they have been working on.

# Chapter 2: Theoretically explaining.

Just when they decided to go and have a word with the girls from the research department, in order to have them take some sort of break, as well as getting a better explanation out of them, more people started showing up at the research room.

The next one to open the door was Bismarck, getting everyone’s attention as she made her way towards the Commander, politely greeting everyone present.

“Commander, everyone.” She greeted, nodding at the Commander and then at everyone else, before coming to a sudden stop.

“Er, who is this child? I don’t recognize him.” Bismarck stated, looking slightly confused by the presence of the metallic bear that remained seated by the Commander’s left side.

Bismarck got closer to the bear until she got its attention, as it looked at her, she simply stopped, looked at it in the eyes, and rather than trying to reach it, she nodded at it and did nothing more.

Everyone had halted what they were saying or doing in order to take a look at the interaction, to be able to witness the moment in which the spiritual Leader of the Iron Blood made a rigging acknowledge her, it was not something someone was able to simply see just any day.

Even if it was sometimes one of the most mundane events to take place in Azur Lane.

In response to her gesture, the bear simply nodded back, as if greeting her, she did nod back minutely in turn again, being well acquainted with how to treat even the rowdiest of riggings, or the rowdiest rigging owners for that matter.

“Er, we don’t really know.” The Commander said, looking at the bear as well “The girls here seem to be all over the place, we haven’t gotten a straight answer out of them since we arrived.”

The Commander told Bismarck, who in response furrowed her brows.

“I have come as requested.” She said with some manner of discomfort evident. “But now I worry about the girls here though, they seemed to have requested for Z23 to attend as well. As you know, she is on a trip with her friends. I thought this was well known through the base, given her important role as one of your attendants. Yet somehow, they asked for her to be present.”

The Iron Blood leader said, earning a few furrowed brows as well as quizzical looks from those present. Z23 and her friends were well known by everyone at the base, they were a bright and cheerful bunch, their friendship was a reminder that mutual help and trust on each other was possible regardless of their past or which faction they belonged to.

Even some of the Azur Lane human personnel who had some sort of initial doubts against the Kansen had quickly developed a soft spot for the four cheerful destroyers.

As such, it was more or less unthinkable that someone would have completely missed them not being in the base. Especially a multi-factional team such as the one from the research department.

As they were wrapping their heads regarding such a colossal slip from their friends, which only made everyone more concerned about their current state, the door to the room opened once more making everyone turn to see who was the next one to come in.

The one that showed up at that moment was one of the Commander’s trusted secretaries, Helena.

“Ah, Commander, everyone. I’m glad to see you could attend. The girls made it sound like this meeting was rather important.”

Helena made her way towards the group, nodding in acknowledgement to everyone in the room and sharing a quick hug with a few of them as well. She only stopped once she was in front of the Commander, she  had halted her movements as soon as she noticed the bear beside the Commander.

“Er… good day to you” She said tentatively towards the bear, bowing minutely towards it, a polite and neutral gesture that worked wonders on the multinational environment of Azur Lane.

In response the bear nodded back in acknowledgement, then it looked at her, holding her gaze for a couple of seconds, before looking to the side as if content with the exchange.

“Er, ok then. Commander! Here, take a look at this” she said, giving him a clipboard she was carrying.

“This all seemed to be all over the place, so I thought you might want to check on this. The research department sent us two lists of people for this gathering.” She stated as she pointed at the first page on the clipboard.

Quickly looking at the paper, the Commander quickly realized that all the people listed were either people from his inner circle, or people with whom he had developed strong bonds one way or another, as Lieutenant Yannis’s presence indicated.

“Most of the people in the first list confirmed they would attend, with some of them still obviously yet to arrive” She said after looking at those currently present.

“Most were able to make changes to their previous arrangements to come, with the exception of people not currently present on base. Although we were told to try and convince the people there to ‘come back as fast as possible for this’, even though that was simply unrealistic.”

At the mention of that, everyone’s thoughts went back again to the mentioned slipup regarding Z23. Now it was obvious she was not the only one requested to be present that was way out of reach.

“Wait, you mentioned there were two lists of people, Helena.” King George said, one finger to her lips as she was taking mental note of what the Commander’s secretary had said.

“er… yeah… the second list is… a bit different… this is a list of the -must not attend-” she said wincing at the mention of this.

The Commander raised an eyebrow at this, echoing a shared feeling regarding such a statement.

“That- Just… let me take a look at this list.” The commander flipped onto the next page, to look at the second list of people that Helena had given him on the clipboard.

As the commander went over the names, his expression became troubled at first, when he had finished it, he actually seemed to have become somewhat tired.

“This… this is bad, if anyone within the list gets to see it, it would surely mean trouble.”

“I agree, Commander” Helena stated. “There is only one copy of this, I wanted to show it to you, once this endeavor has taken place, I am to destroy this piece of evidence”

“We have taken measures so that the people listed here won’t be attending, we requested assistance from people that can be discreet about such a thing, while helping us to keep them busy as well.”

Helena made such an assurance with a solemn tone that disquieted more than one among those present. Her words had created such a concern, that even the usually composed Enterprise moved closer to the Commander to take a look at the list, to which in turn he simply gave her the clipboard for her to look at it at her own leisure, making a gesture with his hand towards everyone else, indicating that it was not an issue to share it among those present.

“Oh… Yes, I agree. This would surely create some friction to say the least.” She said.

“Care to give us a hint about it, Enterprise?” King George said as she turned to look at the Union carrier.

For her part, Enterprise handed the clipboard to Belfast, who had remained beside King George, which in response nodded minutely and put the document in front of king George while standing by her side, so the two of them could see their contents.

“Seems to be composed of every girl out here that has a… Passionate… personality.” Enterprise said after she found some more tactful words to convey her thoughts on the matter.

“It seems to be composed of every woman in this base that would still openly make a quarrel regarding your marriage with the Commander.” King George said dryly.

“Well, honestly that sounds like a reasonable list to have for most events, just common sense to veer away from the yanderes at this point” Lieutenant Yannis with a dry chuckle.

There was a snort in response at that, it was soon followed by a couple snickers, it was a very unladylike snort that came from an unexpected source, which as a result made more of them laugh back, a result of those currently present being quite comfortable with each other. But aside from that no one seemed to prepare themselves to refute his words.

The Commander simply grunted in response to that. Even after being married to both Enterprise and Belfast there were a few of the girls that refused to treat him differently, some for the better, a handful for the worse.

He had never intended to become some sort of heartbreaker, nor he had pushed any sort of advances on them. He had been clear to them that he had no intention to pursue them in either a romantical nor a physical way, but that hadn’t deterred them, nor it seemed like they were willing to listen to him. From his perspective they all had developed extreme fixations on him as well as some degree of lovesickness. He had personally seen experts as well as talked with their friends and family about various ways to help them.

That was the very least he could do, otherwise he felt like he was robbing them of the opportunity to have a full life, with him being sort of an obstacle by not being part of their lives.

 

“I think we are getting more questions rather than answers out of this” Belfast said, interrupting everyone’s thoughts on the subject.

She had obviously sensed how the subject had troubled him, as per usual he felt quite troubled regarding this particular matter. In such times he always felt blessed by the support of his friends as well as his wives.

“Oh! I think this is more than enough people to give the first explanation.” Chkalov had arrived while everyone was preoccupied with the list of people that Helena had brought, surprising everyone by seemingly appearing out of nowhere.

She stood and eyed everyone without saying anything else, with her hands in the pockets of her coat, she nodded a couple times acknowledging something she had yet to speak of.

“Ideally the little booklets should provide all the information, saving us the time to give an explanation. But that’s unrealistic, as there is always room for some misinterpretation. Waiting for everyone to be present, in order to explain things only once, would be also quite unlikely, especially when time is such an issue. So, I believe our goal is to only explain things twice, thrice tops, with a misunderstanding rate on the minimum.”

Chkalov explained, but it seemed more or less like she had explained things mostly to herself, as her focus had slipped at some point and it looked like she had begun making calculations on how to best solve an issue, in this case, the issue of how to repeat oneself the least.

“Er… care to explain… more in, uh, layman terms?” Lieutenant Yannis said.

“Yes, that’s a great idea too!” Chkalov said excitedly.

“Well, you see, the thing is, we seem to be running out of time. Or rather, things will get complicated the more time we allow to pass” She said as she shook her head with her hand at her temple.

“That fellow over here” She gestured towards the metallic-bear-rigging who had remained besides the Commander. “That’s the praetor cube that Doctor Bethencourt gave to the Commander.”

Her words shocked everyone present, resulting in everyone looking at the bear once again and then looking back at the Northern parliament girl, to make sure she wasn’t pulling a fast one on them.

“Have to give it to him, the doctor is both a genius as well as a madman. He discovered the way to prepare an -adaptative wisdom cube matrix-” Chkalov said as she gestured with her hands as if clomping together several cubes floating in the air onto a smaller space.

“The objective of the praetor cube is to anchor itself to the -concept- of whoever is to be the final user and then function like an external armor that holds various capabilities similar to those of a Kansen.”

“At least that is the simplified version he himself described in his papers. We have gone through those extensively, we did not want to leave anything to chance, especially after the first accident happened”

Chkalov gestured towards the bear again, who in turn seemed content to simply be mentioned.

“What do you mean by that? There have been no reports of any emergencies in the research department” Helena stated, obviously bothered by the idea of an accident having happened within the base, holding her gaze on Chkalov.

“Oh, it was not that kind of accident” Chkalov responded while gesturing vaguely around the place.

“As we tried to analyze the Praetor cube, in order to find out if it was safe to even consider making use of it, and making sure it held no possible backdoors to exploit an easy access to the Commander, the cube started reacting to the equipment we were using as well as to our prodding. In the end the cube absorbed the equipment as well as the table it was on along with anything that was stored in the table’s compartments.”

At that she gestured for them to follow her, leading them closer to the tables in the lab room, grabbing a mug of coffee that was sitting on the table and then she gestured at the area right next to it, one area much more open than the rest. Now that everyone was paying attention to what she was saying, marks of furniture emplacement became evident, holes for where one of the metallic tablets would be safely held on the ground.

“That was a response of the cube attempting to synchronize with its surroundings, in turn absorbing the table along with various gadgets and books that were stored on that table. Most of those were from the motherland, which in turn resulted in it looking as it does right now.”

Everyone eyed the bear, who in return just nodded, as if agreeing with everything that had been said. The bear really looked the part of a Northern Parliament rigging, and after hearing Chkalov’s explanation, it made some sort of sense, if it could adapt to the user, it would reflect some traits of the user in the same way that riggings would show traits and parts of a Kansen’s vessel.

“Given the many possibilities, this was not an -ideal- result, as we could have arranged for a combined influx of influences for it to take shape. But my personal bias is that this is a good outcome, nonetheless. It has the commanding look of a northern Parliament Rigging, as well as the responsiveness of one.”

Chkalov took a sip of her coffee at that, seemingly lost in her thoughts for a second.

“It would have been interesting to see something less ‘organic’, like a rigging from the eagle union, but that would have created issues about compatibility between a living being and a ‘machine rigging’…”

“But I digress…” She said after taking another sip at her coffee “Simply put, the more time that the praetor cube remains untethered to the Commander, the greater the chances for it attach itself to someone else or even worse, to get the wrong idea of who the Commander is, either by simple hearsay or by the treatment it receives by us, which is reflective of the Commander and how he handles situations. Think of it as getting the wrong first impression by not being present, even if it was not his fault”

“Say, if it has come to this, why not ask for Doctor Bethencourt for assistance? He was the creator of this after all.” Lieutenant Yannis said, to which a few of them nodded their heads while others remained pensive on the question.

“Well, there are a couple reasons.” Chkalov said as she lifted two fingers “For starters, since this involves the Commander, we didn’t want to leave such an important role to someone who is foreign to Azur Lane, to us. He created it, as such he could be able to slip by any new backdoor or malicious influence without us being able to do anything about it.”

“The second is that he really doesn’t know the Commander, we are sure he has ways to overcome the problem with synchronizing to the concept of the Commander, but there are guarantees it would lead to the best result either.”

“There is also the matter of our pride as researchers and scientists, but we will not count that towards our main reasons.” She said much more quietly, almost like a secondary thought that had slipped past her lips.

“We made some plans regarding the best way to allow it to synchronize with you, comrade. Due to its high adaptability, our main concern was that it would try to anchor itself with a - *you* \- that does not exist in the real world.”

“Er… can you elaborate on that?” The Commander asked, sharing a confused sentiment among most people present.

“Yes, of course, it is highly convoluted, honestly. The Praetor cube will not really *synchronize* with the user. In order to respond to his movements and commands, it will link itself to the very concept of being part of the person it will be making use of. A solution evidently brought by someone who specializes in the field of bringing forth concepts into existence, really.”

“The problem lies in anchoring the praetor cube to the concept of the person.” She said sighing, putting her fingers on her temple as if suddenly hit by a bothersome subject

“It needs to link itself to the concept of who the Commander is. Here lies the problem, if we establish a wrong concept it will fail to respond, since it will be linked to the concept of a different person who is the Commander yet it is -not- the Commander.”

She said while gesturing towards the Commander, stopping in the middle of her explanation only to take another sip at the coffee, scrunching her nose as she looked at it, placing the mug back on the table.

“I assume you were intrigued by the second list of people we sent.” Chkalov said as she pointed at the paper sheet that had made its way back to Helena’s hands.

“We didn’t come to that list out of spite, nor to spurn anyone.” Chkalov shook her head, obviously somewhat troubled by that idea.

“This is an additional problem we foresaw. If the praetor cube gets the wrong information regarding the Commander, and who he is, the whole anchoring process would surely fail. Since it will be trying to make a connection with someone like the Commander yet different to him. 

“The people we asked to be present today are those closest to Comrade Commander. His friends,” She said as she gestured at Lieutenant Yannis and King George.

“His confidants, his family, his spouses.” Chkalov now gestured towards Bismarck, Helena, Belfast and Enterprise in the same order as she explained things.

“We need all of you present to establish the concept of who the commander is, the actual commander, the one that loves and fights for his friends and family, the one that is a human that makes mistakes, that overworks himself when he is anxious, the one that we can confide with, the one we trust, and cherish.”

Chkalov said the last part, blushing slightly and looking a bit to the side, as if trying to avoid the looks of everyone as she explained herself.

“While the perception of those in the second list is quite positive, it is not exactly who the commander truly is.”

“I see…” Belfast broke the silence that had befallen them “If Akagi was to be present, the Praetor cube would try to look for a Commander that’s greater than life, one that would set all his enemies ablaze and then conquer the world.”

More than one person grimaced at that. It was a spot-on analysis of how Akagi perceived the commander, and what she wanted of him as well. But everyone present was aware that Erick Anderson was much more than a successful commander.

“Er, one question.” The Commander said towards Chkalov, for her part Chkalov nodded in response waiting for him to continue.

“You seemed to have reached an epiphany when I mentioned the bear being a rigging. What was that about? Wasn’t that part of all of this?”

“Mm… Yes, more or less. We found an issue we could not just quite overcome.” She said as she twirled her hand as if trying to dispel that particular issue.

“Doctor Bethencourt made no attempts setting up a way for you to have a -conversation- with the cube, to come to an agreement with the Praetor cube. As such, there are no traces of established commands, such as ways to command the usage of weapons, but the foremost example that comes to mind is the total lack of a way to remove the Praetor cube armor from the user.”

“It seemed like an inconceivable mistake, but the more we thought about it we came to a different resolution. From what we figure, the Doctor’s affinity with wisdom cubes is so high that they simply become subservient to him, he can have any of his wishes be granted by the wisdom cubes, there is no room for dialogue.”

“I mean, I don’t see an issue with that.” Lieutenant Yannis said, while everyone else seemed to be chewing the argument. “Aside from the whole -removing the cube-? Would it become a permanent part of the Commander?”

“Theoretically, that would not be a problem. One would normally wish for their weapons to simply do what one wishes for them to do, or carry a coveted weapon with them all the time. But that is also something that does not align with the values and personality of the Commander, especially if said -weapons- happen to have a will and personality of their own. Also, while the Commander’s affinity with wisdom cubes is particularly high, we are not convinced it is on the same level as that of Doctor Bethencourt, as such it is quite possible he would not be able to have his orders be accomplished properly.”

“That is why the Commander’s misunderstanding came like a revelation. If we modify the Praetor cube’s base functions ever slightly, it can work much like a rigging, being part of the Commander while at the same time being independent of him. Being able to accomplish tasks on his own with only a request by the Commander.”

“Uh…” The Commander said intelligently, echoing everyone’s thoughts on the matter.",1,1734835701.0,Azurlanefanfics,0,1.0,False
1hjpkaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hjpkaz/the_radio_said_my_name_this_morning/,The Radio Said My Name This Morning,"I wake up early, every day, to my routine. Coffee brews, and the radio plays softly. The station—96.7 FM—is familiar and predictable. The DJs laugh, and the music flows. But one thing always stands out.

Every morning, they pause. Then, they say a name.

“David Miles,” they might say. It’s quick, out of place. They don’t explain. Afterward, the show continues, normal as ever.

I never thought much about it. Maybe it was a joke or a community announcement. The names meant nothing to me—until this morning.

As I poured coffee, I waited. The pause came. Then, I heard it:

“Rebecca Gray.”

My hand went cold. I managed to catch the cup as it tilted slightly. My entire name echoed around the kitchen. As if the air itself had stopped, the moment dragged on heavily.

The station went on. Then came typical, happy weather updates. However, I was unable to let it go. I felt like I was being watched, and my chest clenched. Why my name? Why now?

The sensation persisted. My mind was all over the place at work. I kept hearing the voice on the radio. The hours passed slowly, and at last, I went home. My sanctuary, the apartment, seemed different. Long stretches of shadow were accompanied by a dense, deafening quiet.

By 10 PM, I gave in. Something pushed me—urged me—to turn on the radio again. I hesitated, but my fingers moved. Static buzzed, then music returned, slower than usual. The rhythm unsettled me. My breathing quickened.

A pause interrupted the song. I braced myself.

“Rebecca Gray,” the voice said again.

This time, it was sharper. The sound felt closer, like it wasn’t just in the radio. I froze, waiting, listening. The air turned colder. My pulse pounded in my ears.

Then, the knocking started.

It was soft, tapping on the window. My head snapped toward the sound. Nothing was there. I held my breath. The tapping came again, louder this time.

With my pulse pounding, I edged closer. Outside, the grass was covered in the shadows cast by the swaying trees. There was no one, yet the wind whispered. Still, the knocking persisted, steady and insistent.

I stepped back. My legs felt weak. The room darkened, though the lights remained on. The radio crackled, and I turned toward it instinctively.

“Rebecca Gray,” the voice hissed. This time, it didn’t feel human.

The wind howled louder, and the knocking turned to banging, violent and desperate. My chest tightened, and I backed away. The radio buzzed, the music distorting. Shadows seemed to shift, reaching toward me.

“Rebecca,” the voice said, softer now, almost gentle. “You’ve been called.”

The banging stopped. The silence was worse. My name echoed in my mind. I couldn't tell if the wind outside was real or if I was losing control as it shrieked. I fell to the ground when my legs gave out.

They had called me. And I wasn’t [ready](https://unseenofficial.blogspot.com/2024/12/blog-post_21.html).",1,1734835679.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I love animals, litterally all of them-.Dogs, cats, or anything with fur or feathers, they’re all my favorites.

Let's have a little chat. Yes about THE question that comes up time, and time again. ""how do I use the bathroom when concealed carrying?""

There's many jokes to be had and I look forward to reading them but also, it is a legit question because there are serious consequences if you mess it up.

There are many techniques and methods to how people navigate using the bathroom stall when they conceal carry. Some are good - those being any that ensure the gun stays attached to your person. Some are terrible, e.g., putting the gun on the toilet paper roll, on the toilet seat behind you, on the ground - anything that removes the gun for your person is bad news. Literally news - people end up in the news because they forget their loaded gun in public restrooms and there can be some serious charges attached to that all depending on how the district attorney and general public feels about it when it becomes news.

I am a believer that if you have a technique that works well for you and it doesn't remove the gun from your person, great, keep at it. I personally never found a technique that I enjoyed using and I was always frustrated with using the public bathroom when I carried. As someone who worked at an office where I carried everyday, I would be making a bathroom stall trip at least once a day (thanks coffee). 

As well, I hate to admit but will for honesty sake that I unfortunately made the grave error in the past of forgetting my gun in a bathroom. My stomach dropped, my heart pounded, I felt like an absolute idiot. I ran back and quickly recovered it. Thankfully no one found it.

That's when I fully realized how massive of a risk this was and how important of a subject it was to discuss. I also realized that I could NEVER let the gun leave my person again, but I also could not find a technique that worked well for me. 

That's why I created [stallster.com](https://stallster.com)

Stallster is a convenient, complimentary product for your CC that is meant to store your *holstered* firearm on your person while you use a bathroom stall. It allows you to have 2 hands free to navigate the bathroom easily and gives you peace of mind that you'll never forget your firearm because it's always attached to your person.

Stallster easily becomes a regular part of your CC loadout and can fit on your belt, right next to your CC. Since it's made of fabric you'll hardly notice the feeling of wearing it and probably stop noticing it entirely after a few minutes. I spent a long time prototyping it to fit as many holster/firearm combos as possible and hopefully I've manage to design it to fit most. You can check out fitment video examples here: [stallster.com/pages/gun-holster-fit-in-stallster](http://stallster.com/pages/gun-holster-fit-in-stallster)

I'm happy to carry on a full discussion on navigating the bathroom with a CC and want to hear how you all go about doing it. I do genuinely think it is a serious topic to discuss and I don't want anyone to make the grave mistake of forgetting their firearm in the bathroom like I did.

Don't end up as a news article.   
Here's a database I'm creating of news articles of people who forgot their CC in public bathrooms: [https://stallster.com/pages/news-article-database](https://stallster.com/pages/news-article-database)

P.S. I quit my fulltime cybersecurity job to build Stallster 5 months ago. It's really a small operation with humble beginnings. I'm currently just sewing Stallsters out of my apartment and working to find a USA sewing manufacturer to work with so it can scale.

Kevin fished around in Castle’s pockets and retrieved the keys to his truck. Castle’s incoherent moaning picked-up a little while Kevin was searching him.

*I could end up like that*, I thought\*. All it takes is for some other player to gently tap me. Is that what death is like here? Is it worse than oblivion because I’ll stay in that semi-conscious state forever?\*

I followed Kevin into the parking lot. He handed me the Castle’s keys. “Okay, here’s the plan –“

“Woah – you want me to drive this thing? I can’t do that.”

He pointed to his crown, “King.” He rapped on my helmet like he was knocking on a door. “Pawn.”

I sighed and yanked the keys from his hand. “I don’t even know how to drive a -“

“The plan,” he interrupted. “Listen. There are two key elements to the plan. One – you drive this thing north, to Rankate Park. Two – and this is the key part of the plan - make bad decisions. You have to do what you do best which is to make terrible decisions.”

“That’s not even a plan! That’s just … “ I struggled to find the words. “That’s just you insulting me in a parking lot.”

“North!” he said. “Rankate Park! Bad decisions.” Then he spun around and marched back into the E6.

I climbed into the cab of the truck. I’d never been in the cab of an eighteen-wheeler before. The steering wheel was huge, and was mounted on the dash at a weird flat angle. The shifter looked like some kind of puzzle with three reverse gears and a ten or so forward gears. The dash had five times the number of gauges than a regular car.

Castle had positioned the driver’s seat so far back that my feet didn’t event brush the pedals. I fumbled around for a few seconds before I figured out how to slide it forward. A chess piece – a rook - was stuck to the dashboard with a suction cup. I pulled it off and tossed it on the passenger seat. This was my truck now. A pawn’s truck.

I found the ignition and turned it on.

The truck rumbled to life. The deep growl under the hood had a heaviness to it, like I was about to drive one of the Earth’s tectonic plates instead of a vehicle. I said what I’m guessing everyone says the first time they sit in the driver’s seat of a big rig.

“Oh *Yeah*…”

I smirked the smirk of someone about take control of something that could generate far more power than they could control, and put the truck into first gear.

The truck stalled as soon as I eased my foot off the clutch. I messed with the shifter and tried again. Stall. I moved the shifter through its little labyrinth of gear positions to make sure I had it in the first gear. Stall. I honked the horn, just to make me feel like I was in control of something, then I messed with the lever on the shifter. This time the truck slowly crawled forward when I hit the gas.

I steered towards the ramp from the E6 parking lot to the northbound side of the highway. I shifted twice more before I reached the road, but was still only moving about fifteen miles an hour despite being in third gear.

I managed to get the truck up to a normal highway speed with only a few severe gear grinding incidents. I imagined Castle, still writhing and moaning on the floor of the E6 travel store emitting tearful whimpers of pain each time I ground the gears on his truck.

I found the control for the windshield wipers. I figured out how to turn on the headlights. In my button-pushing and switch-flipping I accidentally turned on the sound system. Evil-sounding German industrial metal music blasted into the cab. The relentlessly driving industrial metal filled me with confidence and I shifted through three more gears, getting the truck up to seventy or so. Was this what Castle was listening to when he decided to ram Kevin and I? Soon I was singing along, even though I had no idea what the German words meant.

*""Got vise ish vil kine Engel zine.""*

I passed a sign:

*Rankate park: 2 miles*.

I had almost completed the first phase of Kevin’s “plan.” I started to ponder the second part, where I was supposed to make bad decisions. Is it even possible to wisely make a bad choice? Is planning to have a bad plan a paradox?

The trees surrounding the highway thinned, then were suddenly gone entirely as the highway crossed a stretch of farmland. The rain stopped abruptly. The clouds thinned and the light of the full moon washed away the night's impenetrable gloom. Was this new landscape and new weather a sign that I had I crossed into a new cell on the grid?

Beyond the fields, it seemed the world ended. The road traced a path between the fields into an immense dark void beyond. I let off the gas a bit as I tried to understand what was beyond the fields. Was the void *the black edge of the board* that Kevin told me about at the party?

I drove past another sign:

*Rankate Park: 1 mile.*

*No Beach Access*

I laughed at myself for a moment. The endless darkness beyond the fields was just the ocean. I stepped on the gas again to get back up to highway speeds.

There was movement to my left. Someone passing me? I checked the driver-side mirror and saw nothing but empty highway behind me. I looked out into the field to my left. Something was out there. It was a monster. No, correction, *she* was a monster.

I didn’t think “oh, a monster,” right away, of course. The human brain doesn’t work that way when it encounters something new. The visual system needs a second to grasp what it sees. It hands over its results to the cortex, which has to think things through a bit. Once the cortex ponders it for bit, and understands just how “wrong” what its seeing is, the limbic system takes over. The limbic system needs another half-second-or-so to figure out that “fear” is the right response. Well, in my case, terror was what it dialed up.

At first I thought the large object in the field to the left of the road was a dilapidated structure – maybe a half-demolished grain silo or water tank. But no. It was moving. Not just traveling forward, parallel to the road, but running at the same speed as the truck.

It was maybe twenty feet tall – too large to be any kind of normal animal. As I more fully processed what I was seeing, I saw that it *wasn’t* running, exactly. It was galloping. No not even galloping– galloping is something that creatures with four legs do. This thing had more than four legs. Six? Probably more. It was hard to tell because it was wearing a *dress*.

It – she – whatever - was human-like, in that she was wearing clothes, had legs, a torso, arms, and a head all arranged in the normal vertical way that we humans are organized. Her human-like arms were attached at the shoulders, but there were way too many of them. She had eight arms.

Her head was a grotesque oversized mass. A human head scaled up to hold eight separate faces, each looking out from the eight main compass points. The resemblance to the eight-faced horror version of myself I saw in the reflection of the window and the rear-view mirror was obvious. One difference between her eight-faced abomination of a head and what I saw of my own in the mirror is that she wore an enormous crown of steel spikes. This thing, this *person*, had to be the queen. The black queen.

I startled as the truck drifted over the rumble strip on the right side of the road and onto the shoulder, I overcorrected, sending the truck into the center of the road. The queen also heard the truck hit the rumble strip. She turned her head slightly and sneered at me with two of her faces. Her faces – the two that looked at me anyway - reminded me of the Statue of Liberty. They had a similar dingy tarnish, like she was wearing greenish-grey makeup. Both faces bore the same resting-bitch-face scowl as Ms. Liberty.

The queen turned slightly to her right, smashed through the left-side guard rail, and ran onto the highway. I slammed on the brakes and slid to a stop in the center of the road. The queen continued her strange, arhythmic, loping run, rapidly moving away from me down the center of the road.

The face on the 180-degree rear of the queen’s head looked directly at me and shouted something I could not hear from inside Castle’s cab. She slowed to a jog, and then a complete stop. Behind her, the road opened into a parking lot. A park-sign-brown sign on the side of the road announced that the road ended at Rankate Park.

We stayed there, staring at each other. Me, sitting in the cab, listening to Castle’s insane German Industrial Metal. A hundred yards ahead, at the entrance to the Rankate parking lot, the 20-foot-tall, many-limbed, eight-faced queen stared back at me. Behind her, the paved parking lot ended at what looked like an observation area overlooking the ocean, a hundred feet or so below us.

*…Make bad decisions…*

Kevin’s voice floated through my consciousness. A demented, acid-trip version of Obi-Wan telling Luke to use The Force.

I could try ramming her, I thought. The truck is really powerful, so that might be a good idea. No, I mentally corrected myself, I need bad ideas, not good ones.

We stared at each other for three or four songs. From time to time she would turn her head slightly so that another face would have a chance to glare at me. But other than the dirty looks, she did nothing. It must be my move.

I looked around the cab of Castle’s truck. Was there anything here that could help me? Some clue as to how this weird world behaved? I didn’t see anything other than what I assumed was the usual trucker stuff: maps, coffee cups, a clipboard with some kind of cargo manifest. What kind of cargo was Castle hauling, anyway? Is there, like, an economy here? Was he making a delivery? I grabbed the clipboard and tried to make sense of it. It was just a list of coded and abbreviated items: PT, CF, 1 gross, pallet.

I unbuckled my seatbelt and cracked the driver’s door open. The queen didn’t move. I opened the door and swung myself out onto the footplate. Nothing from the queen. I jumped down to the pavement, still focused on the queen. She turned her head to glare at me with a new face, but was otherwise motionless.

I walked to the back of the truck, and scrambled up the metal bars that functioned as the trailer’s rear bumper. I fumbled with the door handle for a bit, but finally got the door to swing open. I scrambled inside. I had to open the second door to let enough light in to see the cargo clearly. Castle was hauling about ten pallets of Cosmic Fudge flavored Pop Tarts.

I strolled the length of the trailer interior to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. I wasn’t. Just ten pallets of Pop Tarts – all Cosmic Fudge flavored – and pallet jack lashed to the wall.

*Bad decisions*. I needed bad ideas to make bad decisions. I thought. Nothing came to mind. I stopped thinking and just acted. I unlashed the pallet jack from the trailer wall and rolled it to doorway. I slid the tines under the pallet next to the door and pushed it to the edge of the trailer. It didn’t weight much – a gross of crates of Pop Tarts is only a hundred-fifty pounds or so. I maneuvered the pallet so it was hanging off the edge of the trailer, slid the jack out, and then pushed hard on the load of plastic-wrapped Pop-Tart boxes. The pallet of Pop Tarts rolled out of the truck and spilled onto the road.

I worked the pallet jack under the next pallet and did the same thing. I thought I heard a gasp, or maybe a shout from the queen. I worked quickly, pushing the rest of the pallets out of the truck. I expected to see the queen’s huge, eight-faced head appear in the doorway at any moment, ready to take me out. But she didn’t show up. It was still my move.

I hopped down from the trailer and walked back to the cab. The Queen was still in her position by the Rankate Park sign. Still glaring at me.

“What do you think you are doing!” she shouted from the face that was most-directly looking at me. “I’ll have your head for this!” Her voice was not what I expected. I thought she would sound “Queen like” – she’d have a snobby upper-class British accent. But she was American. From Boston, maybe?

I climbed into the cab and put the truck into gear. This time, I knew what I was doing and I didn’t have any embarrassing stall outs. I rolled the truck forward about fifty feet.

The queen began shouting again. I couldn’t hear what she said. I figured out how to turn off the Castle’s heavy metal music and I opened the driver’s window. “What?” I shouted back?

“You pathetic pawn. Just because you stole a truck, it doesn’t mean you’re a rook. I’ll bite your head off!”

I leaned out the window to make sure she’d hear me. “You mean, you’d actually chew on my head? That’s pretty gross!”

“It’s a figure of speech, pawny pants!” There was that stupid insult again. “But this one,” she used three of her arms to point at the face on the left side of her head, “she’s a little bit off, you know. She might actually do it!”

I put the truck into reverse and rolled it backwards towards the pile of Pop Tarts.

“My Tarts!” the Queen screamed. “My Tarts! Stop! You’ll ruin them!”

I smiled and kept rolling slightly backwards. *Your move*, I thought. I had a bad feeling about my plan. But it was a familiar bad feeling. The same feeling I had just before I attended my cousin’s super-formal wedding barefoot. Or when I tried to arm-wrestle the bouncer at O’Flanagan’s. Or when I did a million other stupid things. I was doing what came naturally – making bad decisions.

The Queen launched herself into a sprint directly at the truck. If you’ve got six or eight legs, you can really get some good acceleration. She screamed at me, literally and figuratively, as she rushed the truck.

For a moment, I thought she was going to take me out. And that she was going to do it in a much more violent and bloody way than I did when I took out Castle. I’d have to face oblivion, lying on the road next to the park. But she didn’t take me out. She raced past the cab – the face on the right side of her head spit at me as she passed – and stopped at rear of the trailer.

“My Tarts!” she screamed again.

The truck stopped rolling backwards. I looked in the driver-side mirror and saw the Queen leaning into the trailer, pushing it forwards, away from the tarts, with all the force she had in her collection of sixteen limbs.

I put the truck in a forward gear and stomped on the gas. I rolled forward slowly at first, then faster and faster. In the mirror, the Queen fell behind as the truck moved away from the pile of her precious Pop Tarts.

I shifted gears, then shifted again. I blasted past the Rankate Park sign with the engine screaming. I accelerated through the parking lot, towards the observation point. A sign that said “Viewing area. Caution, steep drop off” was planted directly in front of me.

*Make Bad Decisions*

I flattened the sign and kept the truck rolling forward. Through the safety railing and into the void beyond.

For a moment, the cab stayed level as it flew off the cliff. Then it pitched downwards as the forces of gravity and the cantilever of the trailer the trailer rolled me towards the ocean below. I saw the dark water churning at the base of a rocky cliff. *The Black Edge of the Board*, I thought.

Then I was standing on the ground. I was in park’s viewing area looking out over the ocean as the truck crashed onto the rocks below and rolled into the surf.

I felt dizzy. I took a step back from edge. Eight legs moved me in a coordinated but inhuman motion to where I wanted to be. “Wha….” I began to speak, and heard eight different versions of my voice.

I remembered my conversation with Kevin at the party. Only hours ago:

*“Chess, right?” Kevin had said. “You know what happens when a pawn makes it to the other side?”*

*“Yeah, it turns into a queen. The most badass piece on the board.”*

I’m kind-hearted, open-minded, and love meeting people who can make me smile and keep me intrigued. If you’re someone who appreciates warmth, charm, and enjoys getting to know someone in a real way, I’d love to hear from you!

A little about me: I have a wide range of interests, from exploring the desert landscapes to cozying up with a good book or checking out local art and events. I’m also passionate about cooking (though I’m more into experimenting than perfecting), and love the idea of sharing a meal with someone who appreciates the simple pleasures in life. I’m always up for new adventures, and there’s nothing better than a good conversation over coffee or cocktails.

I value connections that are built on mutual respect, kindness, and trust – with a touch of playfulness. My life as a transwoman has taught me a lot about embracing who I am and savoring every moment. But I’m not just about deep talks and life lessons – I’m also someone who enjoys some flirtation, light teasing, and the thrill of getting to know someone new in a relaxed, fun way.

If you’re looking for someone who is sweet, down-to-earth, and a little bit intriguing, I’d love to hear from you.

About a year ago my gastroenterologist prescribed that I take a PPI (Nexium) every other day to prevent heartburn. Prior to that, I had self medicated for about 10 years with PPIs but in a reactive manner rather than proactively every other day. Since then, my regular heartburn has abated, however I now have a regular scratch in my throat I can't scratch and am constantly clearing my throat. My ENT used a laparoscopic scope on my nose and throat and suggested I now have silent heartburn, or laryngopharyngeal reflux.

In addition to the scratchy throat, the right side of my throat is swollen and my larynx has shifted out of alignment to the left. I'm concerned but my gastro just wants me to start taking pantoprazole to treat my heartburn. I guess I'm not convinced. I haven't had any issues in the past and since going on her regime are when my very noticeable problems started. Any gastros here with a different opinion, or is pantoprazole really my best bet?

That is, until a villain kidnaps your entire time, and you decide to show them all just how much you’ve been holding back all these years.","I didn’t see a purpose in fighting, not when I could be the joker of the group. All my teams ever known is violence. You leave the academy, and you’re told you’re a crime fighting badass, the type that will die for the cause. The grim reality of hero work is the reason they need someone like me. Someone that can remind them that there is a soul hidden beneath those powers. It didn’t matter if I was mocked by heroes and villains alike; I knew what my true power was. The power to make those around me forget about the hardships of life, even if it was only for a moment.

Unfortunately, I had to use my true powers today. It’s been three days since they were taken, and while I remained optimistic that they could free themselves, with each passing day, I was getting more worried. Today, I decided to act. The villains ‘lair’ wasn’t a lair at all. It was a donut shop, one that still served customers their delectable circular treats. If anything, the lair made more sense than the usual castles I came across. Who would ever think about investigating a donut shop? Most cops would avoid it because of the obvious joke headline. ‘Cops investigate donut shop. Find sprinkles.’ Or something more clever than that. It was hard to be witty when you were in disguise.

“One frosted sugar pile!” I said, pressing my cheek against the glass window. My disguise wasn’t an overly deceptive one, only wearing a wig and a pair of sunglasses. If anything, I wanted him to know it was me. That would make this easier. The man behind the counter was old, with a few sprinkles on the edge of his sagging face, most likely from an afternoon snack.

“Is that all, sir? You know we have a hero’s discount, don’t you? Every hero gets a plain donut free.” He smiled, putting on the innocent act. If I hadn’t already seen the man unmasked before, I would have believed he was a normal employee. Most villains couldn’t help but give some vitriol in their words, even while in disguise, but this man radiated nothing but genuine customer service. Which is why I needed to keep up my act.

“Oh, I’m no hero.” He knew I was lying, and that was the point. He needed to think I was stupid, or else he would move my friends.

“Really? My mistake, you look an awful lot like that Dazzler. The hero that can only shapeshift into objects. It’s funny. Everyone says he’s worthless since he needs someone else to wield him when he transforms into an object, but I believe he’s useful. Someone like that can do a lot of good.”

“I just want my donut, dude.” I said, cutting the conversation short. Last thing I wanted was praise from a villain.

He went and collected the donut, putting in an extra plain one with my purchase. After paying, I reached for the bag, only for him to snatch my hand. “Dazzler, I suggest you run along. This is the big leagues, and you're not big league material. I like you, Dazzler, you’re an actual hero. Someone who fights without any grand power. Which is why you should leave this to someone more qualified. Your friends are fine, and when the agency that sends you out pays me, they can go free. This is just business, nothing personal. Now enjoy your meal.” He let go of my hand, and I staggered back, not expecting him to be so upfront about all of this. He really thought that little of me.

I did as he said, leaving the shop, standing outside on the street as I ate my donut, thinking about my next actions. “I should have gotten a coffee.” I mumbled, spitting out a few sprinkles as I did. While eating, I examined the outside of the shop, planning my route inside. “Shouldn’t take me too long to get inside.” After eating, I pulled off my disguise and got to work.

The lie that I could only turn into objects may have been the greatest lie I had ever told. Everyone believed that’s all I could do, not knowing how limitless my transformations were. In a few minutes, I had already snuck into the back of the shop, turning into an ant, mouse and then a pigeon, to get myself into the vents. Then, it was a simple pigeon trot down into the lower levels, where I could see my friends sitting in their individual cells, all looking rather glum. Well, except for Frank, who kept throwing his shoulder into the bars, trying to break them.

“FRANK SHUT UP. How do you still have that much energy?” Alice sighed, her purple hair floating behind her, a side effect of her psychic powers. She looked tired, most likely having wasted a lot of energy trying to bend the bars apart. That must have been why her eyes had lost that usual purple glow they always had.

“What? You think Frank the tank gives up? I’m a freight train, baby. I can run all night.” There was a collective ew from the group as Frank slammed himself into the bars again. The man’s long blonde hair swaying, getting in his face with each collision. Even his Hercules inspired muscles couldn’t bend the bars, leaving them stuck in place.

“We should just wait for help. Maybe Dazzler will come along?” Jill said. Her abilities were always a little strange. In most cases, she could see a few steps ahead of everyone else, like a chess player that knew their opponents’ next three moves. I thought she would have noticed me by now, but maybe it only counted if you could see the opponent in front of you? She adjusted her glasses and sighed, her brown hair falling onto the pillow she was lying on. I always liked her the most, everything from her freckled face to her powers. She felt the most like me. Someone with fewer abilities. There was also a fourth empty cell, which I assume would have been mine.

I turned into a snake and slipped through the vent, dropping onto the ground below them. As soon as my feet? Body? Legs? What did you call the underside of a snake? As soon as my body? Hit the floor, Jill sat up. “Dazzler?”

“What about Dazz? You think he’s here? How would he get past the security?” Frank laughed, his laughter stopping him from ramming into the cell, considering the possibility of me breaking into the villain’s lair. In truth, I hadn’t even noticed the security, most likely taking a route that the villain hadn’t even considered physically possible.

“Maybe he got some help?” Alice mused.

“No, it’s him.” Jill adjusted her glasses. “Just him.” She gasped. “He lied to us. He could transform into anything this entire time.”

I shifted into myself, keeping my head low as I unlocked their cells. My finger changing into a key, cracking open the locks with ease. As they left their cells, they stared at me, expecting something from me. Maybe an apology? “I’m sorry. I just thought it was better if I kept this a secret.”

“WE COULD HAVE USED YOUR HELP AGES AGO. WHY HIDE AN ABILITY LIKE THAT?” Alice slapped the air in front of me, sending a powerful telekinetic slap across my face, one that made my cheek shapeshift to counter the force. The skin bubbling at the spot of impact, reforming to recreate my cheek.

“Look, it’s complicated. I thought everyone needed a clown. I was scared of- OOF.” I groaned as Frank punched my stomach, the impact throwing me into the air, before Alice caught me with her powers, stopping me from hitting the ground. My stomach bubbled again, and the skin reformed, nullifying the impact.

“Heh, I just wanted to try that.” Frank grinned. “I don’t get it. Why would you hide it, though?”

“That’s what he was trying to tell us.” Jill sighed. “I’m not happy about this, but I assume you had a good reason.”

“Well, apart from. Ugh…” I held my stomach, feeling my insides wobble about, before stopping. “Apart from wanting to cheer you all up. I just thought you would think I’m a freak if I told you the truth. I was born as a blank canvas. My poor mother had a baby with no features. This form I took on, I don’t even know if it’s who I really am. There’s a chance I copied some kid I saw when I was little and grew up as them, changing my appearance subconsciously to fit in. My mother thought I was a freak. This was the only way she could look at me. I don’t blame her. This made her happy, and it makes others happy. I like to think this is the real me, that it took time for my features to pop in, but I can’t be sure. I was too young to remember any of it and my mother says she found me like this one day. I’m a freak, I’m sorry. I-“ Before I could cry, Jill slapped me, her slap far softer than the others, keeping my skin from breaking apart.

“You honestly thought we would care about that? How stupid are you? I know you like to play dumb, but I didn’t think you were actually dumb.”

“Jill….”

“How many times have we been there for each other? And you’ve been carrying all that pain and keeping it to yourself? I really want to hit you again. We’re a team, aren’t we? You should have told us how you felt. I don’t care about the powers, I care about you.” Jill’s glasses fogged as she cried. I had never seen her like this before. She was usually so collected and calm.

“I’m sorry, everyone. I’m an idiot.”

“YOU MADE JILL CRY.” Frank tackled me to the floor, pulling me into a tight hug when we landed. “You’re an idiot. I would never hate my bro. You’re you, no matter what.”

Alice walked over to us, giving my head a soft pat. “I can’t believe you held that in all this time. I know I’m not always the most approachable person, but if you need to talk. I’m here for you.”

As I laid beneath Frank, a thought crossed my mind. “Um, we should probably go before he finds out I’m here. Oh, and let’s keep this a secret. Don’t need anyone else knowing about this.”

“It would be handy to have an ace in the hole.” Jill nodded, wiping her eyes.

With that, we broke free from the lair and took down the nefarious villain. As the police took him away, we sat on the counter of the store, eating some donuts. “Ya know, these donuts really do need some coffee.” I mumbled, looking at the other three who wouldn’t have gotten my reference. “Eh, guess you three were locked up when I said that. It was a good reference, though.” I said, as they all continued eating their donuts, ignoring me. “Alright, alright. I get it. Everyone’s a little mad at me. I’ll shout you all dinner the next time we’re out. How about that?”

“With entrees.” Alice said.

“And dessert.” Frank smirked.

“Anything you want Jill? While everyone’s making demands?” I offered.

“A side of no more lies.”

“Ouch…. Ok, fair. I can do that. Hey guys, look. I’m the ace in the donut hole.” I said, holding the donut hole over my eye, watching them roll their eyes, giving me a smile. “Heh, I saw you all smile.”",5,1734833182.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

After trying 6 to 7 weird coffee shots over a few days, I managed to pull a decent shot today. At one point, I was grinding at size 6 based on a YouTube video from the Hot Froth channel. This choked the shot, and when I tried to remove the portafilter, coffee and water burst everywhere. Lesson learned! I didn't give up and tried increasing the size, discovering that a setting of 13/14 works well. I also changed the internal burr dial from 4 to 6, though I'm not sure if this makes any impact. Another thing I learned is not to waste expensive coffee with double shots. Here are my current settings: 

Beans: Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Medium Roast Organic Whole Bean Coffee - Holler Mountain 12 Ounce Bag with Flavor Notes of Citrus Zest, Caramel and Hazelnut

Grinder setting on screen: 16.2 seconds, 1 shot, grind size 13. Ignore the timer on grinder, i am measuring coffee using scale. The only thing i care is grind sizs. 

I'm grinding 10 grams or 10.3 grams and aiming for an extraction of 24 to 28 grams. This is the best shot I've gotten that isn't sour or bitter in taste. It's still missing the caramel and hazelnut notes mentioned on packaging.

1hjorx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1hjorx0/sony_wh1000xm5_vs_bose_qc_ultra/,Sony WH-1000XM5 vs Bose QC Ultra,"I recently got my XM5 (a week ago) and have been with my QC Ultra from one month now, I already compared the Bose with the XM4, and made a general review with my Sennheiser M4, XM4 and XM5, tho i will be focused only in these two in this post, heres what I think about both of them and which I think its better...

\-Build Quality  
The XM5 have been a controversial pair of headphones when coming to build quality, with their broken hinges problems, tho if you take care of them they should take care of you, at least thats what I think, besides that, theyre fully made out of plastic, while the QC Ultra are also mostly made of plastic, their low headband part are made of aluminium, and I havent heard about build problems about them, tho I have heard about their earpads arent durable as they should, tho mines are holding good by now, theyre 1 month old tho so they have a long path to travel still, the Bose takes the W here.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Comfort  
This is subjective, so Ill give my feelings and opinions after using them for short, mid and long periods of time. The XM5 are pretty comfy, with very good earpads, tho their space inside the earcups is more shallow and tight, ""catching"" your ears in a good way, tho their headband is a little narrow, so it kinda feel uncomfortable after some hours, while the QC Ultra have a more wide headband, and a more spacious earcups, this makes your ears feel more ""free"", so this is subjective, but I like more how my ears feel with the Bose, plus their headband doesnt get uncomfortable after a while using them

Winner : Bose QC Ultra (Subjective)

\-Microphone  
Both of them have incredibly good microphones, specially the XM5, coming from a mediocre microphone on the XM4, the QC Ultra have a better mic quality on silent places, tho the XM5 are still good, the Bose are better, but in noisy places, the Sony make an outstanding job, while the QC Ultra does a decent job, it isnt as good as the one in the Sony, both are pretty good, but the Sony mic difference on crowded places is noticeably more than the Bose.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-App and Features  
Sony wins here, hands down, while the Bose App is good enough, with a 3 band eq (you cant save eq presets), different custom modes of ANC / Aware, head detection functions, auto off, etc, Sony have always won here, With their 5 band eq( you can save your eqs), they also give you default eq modes for different types of listenings, speak to chat, auto play, adaptive sound control, Focus on voice transparency mode, ANC and Transparency fully off, that thing when you fully cover the right earcup and transparency activates while lowering music volume if playing something, quick play, etc, etc, etc. Sony clears

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-Battery Life  
Sony claims to have a 30h battery life (ANC on) and a 40h battery life (ANC off), the QC Ultra claims to have a 24h battery (Immersive audio off) and a 18h battery (Immersive audio on), this numbers are what I got and what I researched on my daily use...  
Bose QC Ultra (ANC Max, AAC, High Volume) : 20h-24h  
Bose QC Ultra (ANC Max, Aptx Adaptive, High Volume) : 15h-20h  
Bose QC Ultra (ANC Max, Immersive audio, AAC, High Volume) : 12h-16h  
Bose QC Ultra (ANC Max, Immersive audio, Aptx Adaptive, High Volume) : 10h-15h  
Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Off, AAC, High Volume) : 30h-40h  
Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Off, AAC, High Volume, DSEE Extreme) : 25h-30h  
Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Off, LDAC, High Volume) : 20h-25h  
Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Max, AAC, High Volume) : 15h-20h  
Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Max, AAC, High Volume, DSEE Extreme) : 10h-15h  
Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Max, LDAC, High Volume) : 10h-15h  
In general Sony beats Bose, tho it will depend how you use it and what features you have on and / or off.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-Sound Quality  
They are both bass heavy headphones and have that public focused sound, the XM5 for one hand, have more boomy and punchy bass comparing them to the QC Ultra, but keeping a good clarity overall, this headphones will suit you if you like punchy music like hip-hop and pop, but will maybe lack with instrumental productions and more clarity focused types of music, but they will still be good. The QC Ultra have a more refined and tight bass comparing them to Sony WH-1000XM series, tho it isnt flat at all, its more balanced, but their instrument separation, highs and mids is better than the XM5, their clear and present, so this would fit more if you dont need a super punchy bass, I generally listen to 80s-90s Spanish rock, 80s pop and sometimes chiller hip-hop songs, QC Ultra have better separation, mids and highs, but XM5 have boomier bass while maintaining good clarity overall, I need that boomy bass for my type of music, I enjoy it, so Ill take the XM5, but both are good in their respective ways.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5 (Subjective)

\-ANC  
Probably these 2 are the best ANC headphones out there at this moment, but which is the actual best? well, remember this will change due your head shape and how they fit, because if they dont fit you at 100% their ANC might not be as good as the other, but purely talking about ANC and what I got by testing them in different situations and simulations this is what I got...

Testing them on an Airplane, coffee, office and mall simulation + inside a car and a mall in real life situation, I could tell that the QC Ultra felt quieter, in the Airplane simulation I could tell that the QC Ultra cancelled all the cabin noise, while the XM5 cancelled 85%-90% of it, in the coffee, mall and office simulation I could tell that it was also quieter, tho it was closer, but the QC Ultra was definetely better, the ambient chatter of people was cancelled 100% on the Bose, while in the XM5 was cancelled probably a 90%, while both of them did just as good when cancelling screaming kids and high noises, in real life inside a mall I could only unerstand my dad voice that was just in front of me with the QC Ultra, removing probably 95%-100% of the ambient chatter and muffling those kids and dog barking noises, while the XM5 was almost at the same level, you can feel the Bose are slightly better, take in mind that the QC Ultra make a small white noise, nothing bothering at all for me atleast, while the XM5 are dead quiet, I definetely felt the QC Ultra quieter than the Sony, so Bose wins here.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra 

\-Transparency Mode  
The XM5 did a significantly large jump when it comes to transparency coming from the XM4, they did get it done way better, their transparency is pretty good, its a lot better than the XM4, but Bose did it better here, they are clearer and more natural while on transparency, though not on Airpods Max level, but probably just behind them.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Case  
Bose wins here again, mainly beacuse the QC Ultra fold and the XM5 not, tho I prefer that magnetic space for the cables on the XM5, the QC Ultra is probably one of the smallest if its not the smaller case out there, with their respective space for the cables, so if you want them for traveling the Bose are the right choice, tho the XM5 case isnt huge at all, but its bigger than the Bose.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

Bose QC Ultra winning categories : Build Quality, Comfort, ANC, Transparency Mode and Case  
Sony WH-1000XM5 winning categories : Microphone, App and features, Battery life and Sound Quality

They are both in their respective ways, you wont regret buying either of Sony or Bose top of the line ANC headphones, but you might choose on or another due your priorities, if I had to choose to stay with one I probably would say Bose, because I already have a Sennheiser Momentum 4 for sound, and thats the only main factor that I would choose the Sony over Bose, hope I helped with this! And happy holidays yall! :)

Took me on a PTSD trip in my head to where I got yelled at and treated horribly because of how my mind works. I'm not normal, I know, but I can't help it. Then that argument started to evolve into another one, then one more. 

Finally I broke down and just laid in bed for an hour scrolling TikTok. I got my check a little earlier so I went out and bought some dinner. That made me feel a little better. I came home, ate and watched this movie Obvious Child. Jenny Slate is so hot and just watching that movie helped me cope with the day. I made a banana bread and had my leftover coffee with it. It was still a bit warm and soft when I cut into it. 

The coffee is already making me a little drowsy, coffee doesn't alert me like it does others. So now I'm going to lay in bed and tell a part 2 of my story from when I visited NYC and met up with someone. One of my friends hasn't texted me back yet and she says she's busy prepping Christmas stuff but we're kind of growing apart. I knew her since 2017 so it's sad if we do stop talking.

1hjorbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1hjorbb/please_help_me_figure_on_what_might_be_going_on/,please help me figure on what might be going on with my newborn,"Here’s the revised version with the detail about the lactation consultants (LCs) not being helpful regarding her fussiness:

We had a bit of a rough start, but about a week in, my milk finally started coming in. I pump 1-2 times a day and get around 2-4 oz between both breasts. Early on, my baby slept a lot, so I was only doing about 8 feeds a day and supplementing with formula or expressed breast milk (EBM). Over time, she started needing less supplementation, which gave me confidence that my milk supply was sufficient. Things were going well for a while, with her having plenty of wet diapers and maintaining strong weight gain.

However, over the past few days, she has become extremely fussy during feeds. She starts out okay for the first 10-20 minutes, but when I switch her to the other breast or pause for a diaper change, she gets very upset. She latches but pulls off after a few seconds, becoming tense, arching her back, and turning red while making long grunting noises.

I’ve been waking her to try and continue active nursing because she used to nurse for 30-40 minutes, and I worry she isn’t eating enough now. It’s hard to get her to continue for long after she falls asleep because she usually falls off the breast. I don’t think it’s an issue with letdown or slow milk flow. When I put her on the first breast, she’s fine and often falls asleep or starts sleep nursing after about 15 minutes—so it’s clearly not a fast letdown. The fussiness only starts in the second half of the feed, usually when I wake her up to continue or switch sides. It doesn’t seem to be that the flow is too slow either, because she still gets fussy even when I switch her to the other breast. I’ve tried single-side nursing and alternating, and it happens no matter what.

I’m really struggling to figure out what’s going on because calming her feels like a process of trial and error. I often try multiple things—supplementing with EBM or formula, rocking and comforting, or waiting for her to settle, putting her back on the breast—but I can’t pinpoint one specific thing that always works, they all just work randomly. Her freakouts seem to follow the same pattern, but nothing I do consistently resolves them. I should also add i dont think she cries to the point of exhaustion (although i do hate to see her get so upset at all) but its most like short bursts, our one hour feeding sessions turned to 2 hours but overall she probably doesnt cry for more than 5 minutes altogether but she definitely does tense up and get fussy quite a bit.

Here’s a bit more context:

* She lost 10% of her birth weight early on, but supplementing with formula (1-2 oz after each feed) helped until my milk supply increased. Two lactation consultants (LCs) did weighted feeds during 20-minute nursing sessions and confirmed she was transferring about 2 oz per feed. We gradually decreased the formula and transitioned to just topping off at night.
* Recently, I’ve noticed increased gassiness (lots of burping and farting, plus audible bubbling in her stomach). She also seems to wake up more frequently and takes longer to settle after feeds. Sleep stretches that used to last 3+ hours are now shorter.

One thing I’m worried about is a possible foremilk-hindmilk imbalance. I pumped recently, and the milk seemed very watery, so I’m not sure if she’s getting what she needs. The LCs assured me my diet wasn’t an issue, but I eat a fair amount of dairy, eggs, spicy food, and decaf coffee, so I’m wondering if something I’m eating might be contributing to the problem. Unfortunately, neither of the LCs I’ve consulted with have been helpful in addressing her fussiness or offering any solutions.

Her weight gain is still on track but has slowed a bit compared to when we were supplementing more. While she doesn’t always show hunger cues after feeding, she’ll still take 1-2 oz from a bottle before refusing more. Her pediatrician says she might just be drinking because it’s offered, not because she’s actually hungry.

Despite this, she’s often fussy no matter how much she eats, and I can’t always figure out what finally settles her. Feedings are also taking much longer—what used to take an hour now stretches to two.

I feel like I’m missing something, and I’m considering whether it could be related to a milk allergy, reflux, colic, or something else entirely. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",3,1734832779.0,breastfeeding,3,1.0,False

Bose QC Ultra (ANC Max, Aptx Adaptive, High Volume) : 15h-20h  
Bose QC Ultra (ANC Max, Immersive audio, AAC, High Volume) : 12h-16h  
Bose QC Ultra (ANC Max, Immersive audio, Aptx Adaptive, High Volume) : 10h-15h  
Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Off, AAC, High Volume) : 30h-40h

Sony WH-1000XM5 (ANC Max, LDAC, High Volume) : 10h-15h  
In general Sony beats Bose, tho it will depend how you use it and what features you have on and / or off.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-Sound Quality  
They are both bass heavy headphones and have that public focused sound, the XM5 for one hand, have more boomy and punchy bass comparing them to the QC Ultra, but keeping a good clarity overall, this headphones will suit you if you like punchy music like hip-hop and pop, but will maybe lack with instrumental productions and more clarity focused types of music, but they will still be good. The QC Ultra have a more refined and tight bass comparing them to Sony WH-1000XM series, tho it isnt flat at all, its more balanced, but their instrument separation, highs and mids is better than the XM5, their clear and present, so this would fit more if you dont need a super punchy bass, I generally listen to 80s-90s Spanish rock, 80s pop and sometimes chiller hip-hop songs, QC Ultra have better separation, mids and highs, but XM5 have boomier bass while maintaining good clarity overall, I need that boomy bass for my type of music, I enjoy it, so Ill take the XM5, but both are good in their respective ways.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5 (Subjective)

\-ANC  
Probably these 2 are the best ANC headphones out there at this moment, but which is the actual best? well, remember this will change due your head shape and how they fit, because if they dont fit you at 100% their ANC might not be as good as the other, but purely talking about ANC and what I got by testing them in different situations and simulations this is what I got...

Testing them on an Airplane, coffee, office and mall simulation + inside a car and a mall in real life situation, I could tell that the QC Ultra felt quieter, in the Airplane simulation I could tell that the QC Ultra cancelled all the cabin noise, while the XM5 cancelled 85%-90% of it, in the coffee, mall and office simulation I could tell that it was also quieter, tho it was closer, but the QC Ultra was definetely better, the ambient chatter of people was cancelled 100% on the Bose, while in the XM5 was cancelled probably a 90%, while both of them did just as good when cancelling screaming kids and high noises, in real life inside a mall I could only unerstand my dad voice that was just in front of me with the QC Ultra, removing probably 95%-100% of the ambient chatter and muffling those kids and dog barking noises, while the XM5 was almost at the same level, you can feel the Bose are slightly better, take in mind that the QC Ultra make a small white noise, nothing bothering at all for me atleast, while the XM5 are dead quiet, I definetely felt the QC Ultra quieter than the Sony, so Bose wins here.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra 

\-Transparency Mode  
The XM5 did a significantly large jump when it comes to transparency coming from the XM4, they did get it done way better, their transparency is pretty good, its a lot better than the XM4, but Bose did it better here, they are clearer and more natural while on transparency, though not on Airpods Max level, but probably just behind them.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Case  
Bose wins here again, mainly beacuse the QC Ultra fold and the XM5 not, tho I prefer that magnetic space for the cables on the XM5, the QC Ultra is probably one of the smallest if its not the smaller case out there, with their respective space for the cables, so if you want them for traveling the Bose are the right choice, tho the XM5 case isnt huge at all, but its bigger than the Bose.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

Bose QC Ultra winning categories : Build Quality, Comfort, ANC, Transparency Mode and Case  
Sony WH-1000XM5 winning categories : Microphone, App and features, Battery life and Sound Quality

They are both in their respective ways, you wont regret buying either of Sony or Bose top of the line ANC headphones, but you might choose on or another due your priorities, if I had to choose to stay with one I probably would say Bose, because I already have a Sennheiser Momentum 4 for sound, and thats the only main factor that I would choose the Sony over Bose, hope I helped with this! And happy holidays yall! :)

\-Build Quality  
The XM5 have been a controversial pair of headphones when coming to build quality, with their broken hinges problems, tho if you take care of them they should take care of you, at least thats what I think, besides that, theyre fully made out of plastic, while the QC Ultra are also mostly made of plastic, their low headband part are made of aluminium, and I havent heard about build problems about them, tho I have heard about their earpads arent durable as they should, tho mines are holding good by now, theyre 1 month old tho so they have a long path to travel still, the Bose takes the W here.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Comfort  
This is subjective, so Ill give my feelings and opinions after using them for short, mid and long periods of time. The XM5 are pretty comfy, with very good earpads, tho their space inside the earcups is more shallow and tight, ""catching"" your ears in a good way, tho their headband is a little narrow, so it kinda feel uncomfortable after some hours, while the QC Ultra have a more wide headband, and a more spacious earcups, this makes your ears feel more ""free"", so this is subjective, but I like more how my ears feel with the Bose, plus their headband doesnt get uncomfortable after a while using them

Winner : Bose QC Ultra (Subjective)

\-Microphone  
Both of them have incredibly good microphones, specially the XM5, coming from a mediocre microphone on the XM4, the QC Ultra have a better mic quality on silent places, tho the XM5 are still good, the Bose are better, but in noisy places, the Sony make an outstanding job, while the QC Ultra does a decent job, it isnt as good as the one in the Sony, both are pretty good, but the Sony mic difference on crowded places is noticeably more than the Bose.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-App and Features  
Sony wins here, hands down, while the Bose App is good enough, with a 3 band eq (you cant save eq presets), different custom modes of ANC / Aware, head detection functions, auto off, etc, Sony have always won here, With their 5 band eq( you can save your eqs), they also give you default eq modes for different types of listenings, speak to chat, auto play, adaptive sound control, Focus on voice transparency mode, ANC and Transparency fully off, that thing when you fully cover the right earcup and transparency activates while lowering music volume if playing something, quick play, etc, etc, etc. Sony clears

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM5

\-Battery Life  
Sony claims to have a 30h battery life (ANC on) and a 40h battery life (ANC off), the QC Ultra claims to have a 24h battery (Immersive audio off) and a 18h battery (Immersive audio on), this numbers are what I got and what I researched on my daily use...

You can buy yogurt and strain it to make greek yogurt, yay. Would save me so much money if i could just figure this out.  
I saw someone use paper coffee filters and a wide mesh strainer online, and for them, it peeled right off the coffee filters, no mess or fuss or anything, just a huge lump of greek yogurt.  
Tried this, and for some reason it makes a thick layer underneath, and then when this thick layer forms, the rest cant get through. this is literally always the problem unless i make a sort of trampoline with a kitchen cloth and a stupidly wide bowl, which takes up a crap load of space in the fridge, whey leaks through the cloth and the whole fridge smells of whey. and also the yogurt tastes a little like kitchen cloth.

I literally BOUGHT a greek yogurt strainer with a little lid to try and get around this fuss, and it doesnt work. the yogurt itself goes through the fine mesh strainer part, forms that little layer of thick yogurt, then stops filtering. I put some cloth inside the yogurt strainer to see what would happen, it worked a little better but the same thing still happens and i just kind of want to avoid cloth all together as its such a hassle.  
Any ideas? what the hell am i doing wrong? how do they do it in greek yogurt factories?

Now she uses a Breville barista touch. I was looking this one up, but I noticed that the portafilter has plastic, which is a huge no for us.

On Monday, I’m going to a large espresso coffee e-commerce business with a showroom a few miles outside of Austin. They have Rocket machines, ECM, Rancilla, Gaggia, etc. The budget is not of concern so long as it’s within reason… meaning I would expect it to stay under [$5000] USD.

I need both an espresso machine with a milk heater and a grinder. 
from what I’ve learned, it’s probably impossible to find one that grinds Tamps and makes your coffee all in one without any plastic touching water so that’s fine but I would want one of the best automatic metal burr grinders that also matches the metal espresso maker and milk steamer. We mostly only use oat and almond milk… not sure if that makes a difference.
last thing is that I would prefer to have the ability to hook up to a plumbing line so that in the future when we have a reverse osmosis and remineralizarion system, we can hook it directly up.

So TLDR: 

Looking for the best espresso maker possible with
1. milk heater 
2. no hot liquids touch plastic or aluminum (preferably non plastic at all, if possible) 
3. an automatic burr grinder to match
4. An metal/impressive look (for the fiancé)
5. As easy as possible to use (also for fiance… though I consider myself an aficionado that has done French press, pour overs and moka pot for years.. so I don’t mind the technical fun.
6. Less than $5k or so
7. Plumbing line in OPTIONAL**

I was going to die, but Lilith wasn’t going to be the end of my family. 

I had screamed and pleaded and begged, but she wasn’t going to leave us alone.

I was so fucking done with it.

I was so fucking done with her.

\-

My left sleeve was damp.

I could have got up and grabbed some napkins from the bar, but every time I got up, I came back to my table with another drink and somehow forgot the napkins. I moved on and started wiping my nose on my right sleeve instead. 

That was my problem. I always missed the little things. If I didn’t, my patient would still be alive. 

He was only thirteen.

He had been getting a little worse every session. He seemed more and more frustrated, but he didn’t give me any signs that he would take his own life.

But he did.

All those little comments that I glossed over for six months were little bricks that he was using to build a prison around himself. One that he felt he had only one way out of.

Everyone I talked to said the same thing. 

It happens. 

You need to dust yourself off and keep going. 

Some people are going to do it no matter what. 

Do better next time.

Move on.

Onto the next sleeve.

I was muttering to myself between every drag. The ashtray was two butts shy of a spent pack when she walked over.

“Hi.”

The gorgeous bimbo who was making her rounds finally found her way to my table. She had a small handful of napkins.

“Hi.”

“You seem like you could really use someone to talk to. Can I sit down?” 

The first awkward pause.

“Sure.”

Everything about her looked calculated. The dress, the voice, the hair. All of it made her look like the perfect maneater on the prowl, but her eyes were different. Genuine is the only word that even comes close, but they were even more than that.

All the little bricks I was building around myself were taken down by her eyes. I was lost in them before she even sat down.

“I’m Lilith.”

“Amy.” 

“Nice to meet you.”

“I’m normally a little more put together than this.” That was an understatement. Underneath my sweatshirt were breasts that hadn’t felt a bra or a shower in two days. I had put some deodorant underneath them before I left my apartment because the smell of boob sweat followed me like a cloud.

“I’m sure.” She handed me the napkins and smiled. I wiped my nose and lit another cigarette off of the one I had just finished. I started coughing and grabbed a napkin just in time to catch a nasty bit of something clear and sticky. “My God. You’re really going for it, aren’t you?”

“I’ve had a really bad couple of days.”

“Well, why don’t you tell me about it.” She was earnest, but the question made me laugh. “What’s so funny?”

“It’s… I’m a therapist. I’m usually the one who asks that question. I always ask that one, but I guess I miss the important ones. Fuck! I’m sorry. I’m terrible company right now. I’m so sorry.”

She reached across the table and held my free hand. Her hand was so warm. She studied my face, while I studied hers.

Her brow furrowed and she took a sharp breath. She looked like she understood everything about me, like she could feel everything I was going through.

“You lost someone, didn’t you?” 

My lips were quivering.

Her eyes started to tear up.

“Tell me all about it. Everything. I’ll just listen.” She just held my hand while I spilled my guts as much as I could without violating confidentiality. Outside of the birth of my daughter, I had never felt connected to someone like that. Two spirits coming together with nothing in between them.

But there was something between us. A small omission on her part. A part of her that I was never supposed to see.

There was a little thing.

\-

It’s a strange bit of wonderful knowing that you’re going to die. I’ve heard it from terminal cancer patients. You can breathe a little easier, sleep a little better, because you know how the story is going to end. The only anxiety you have comes from figuring out the tiny details of how you’re going to get there.

I was going to die, but Lilith was coming with me.

I just had to work out the details.

\- 

I had taped black garbage bags over every vent. If Lilith went back into the attic, the plastic wasn’t going to stop her from getting in, but I wanted to make sure she couldn’t see anything. I had tacked up sheets and blankets over every window. It was her turn to wonder exactly what was going to happen next.

I figured Charlie would wake me if Lilith was close, so I was finally able to get a few hours of sleep.

Charlie and I were sitting on the couch plowing through a bag of Funyuns and staring at my dad’s metal thermos. 

It was sitting on the bar in the kitchen; a problem waiting for me to solve.

Maybe she had always wanted a piece of her next to me. I wasn’t sure. I just knew it was something I could use.

“How am I going to do this, Charlie?”

He grumbled a reply and a bit of Funyun fell out of his mouth and onto the couch.

“Well, if you come up with anything, don’t hold back. Just blurt it out. I don’t want to ruin the moment, but we don’t have a lot of time.”

He buried his face in the bag and when he got out of the way, I reached in and grabbed another handful.

It was the first food I hadn’t had to force myself to eat in days. It was delicious. I had made some pasta salad and a tri-tip was marinating in the fridge. I polished off a two liter bottle of Coke, and I was working on my second. I was going to live it up.

“Luring her here should be easy, but how do we get rid of her?” 

We finished the bag, but our stomach’s were still growling. I got up and Charlie voiced his concern.

“Settle down. I’m going to make dinner in a minute, but there’s a tube of Cheez Balls in the pantry. I’ll be right back.”

I eyed the thermos as I walked by; the mess I had made of my mom’s kitchen counter was in the background. So much clutter. I grabbed the tube of goodies and then I froze. There was something on the counter.

I walked back into the kitchen and stared at my mess. Charlie spoke up from the couch and I threw him a Cheez Ball over the bar. 

“I think I found a piece of the puzzle, Charlie.”

The marinade injector I had used on the meat was sitting in a puddle of red wine and worcestershire.

A stainless steel lifesaver. A giant needle that could hold two ounces of liquid.

God bless my father and his obsession with grilled meat.

\-

Charlie had his paws up on my dad’s workbench while he watched me open the thermos and shake the small gob of Lilith out into an empty coffee can.

The thing was very much alive as it crawled around the bottom. It was trying to climb up the sides, but I kept shaking the can to halt its progress.

The marinade injector was full of some lacquer thinner I had found in the garage, and I lowered the needle into the can. I poked the little blob and it attached itself to the end of the needle. I pushed the plunger down and the reaction was immediate. The thing began to writhe and spasm.

I smiled at its pain.

Charlie growled.

I watched the clock on the wall. A young Troy Aikman was holding a football and staring back at me through the hands of the clock.

The reaction only lasted for about five seconds, and then the little thing began moving around as it had done before. I injected it again, but this time, there was no reaction. It shed the lacquer thinner immediately. Almost like it spit it out.

“It adapted. I’ll only have one shot. Five seconds. Not a lot of time.”

Charlie agreed with me.

I pushed the remaining liquid out of the syringe and filled it from a gas can next to the lawn mower. I dribbled it over the thing and then I dropped a match.

Little Lilith raced and jumped around the bottom of the can. A flaming tiny dancer. It finally came to a halt and I watched the fire consume all of it.

\-

“PETE!” I slapped my hands on his window. He screamed as he came out of a dead sleep. 

“HOLY SHIT!”

“Pete! I need to talk to you!”

He slowly climbed out of his car. He shivered at the cold.

“I’m really sorry to wake you, but I need your help.”

“Is everything ok?”

“I need you to do me a favor.”

“What?”

“I need you to take Charlie. I need you to take him and I need you to stay away from my house for a few days.”

“What? Why?”

“He barks whenever she’s around, and I need her to come here.”

“What?”

“Just, please. Take a few days off. Take Charlie. Please. You’re a really good kid, and I don’t want to see you get hurt. Keep my dog safe.”

“I’m supposed to work in two hours. They’re going to want me to come right back here.”

“Cough on the phone. Throw up on a video call. Break a fucking leg. I don’t care. Just stay away.”

“For how long?”

“You’ll know when.”

“Mam, I can’t do that. What about you?”

God, the kid was so nice. Reason wasn’t going to work. I had to hit low, or he’d never leave.

“Pete. I’m not your mother and nothing you do is ever going to bring her back. Understand me? Now take my Dog and go.”

His face dropped. I really hurt him.

\-

It killed me watching him drive away with Charlie. I wasn’t ever going to see him again, and that was the last impression of me he would ever have. Another scar left because of Lilith. I hoped that was the last one.

\-

After the sun came up, I ran outside with a couple of cans of spray paint. Normal people were already out mowing their lawns while the crazy daughter of the Dobkins’ was running around writing things on the beautiful white home in red and neon green spray paint.

I wrote things for Lilith on all four sides of the house. I hoped she was watching.

*“You’ll Have to Come Inside.”*

*“I’m Waiting.”*

*“You Can’t See Me.”*

*“I’m never coming out, so what are you Waiting For?”*

I stood in the middle of the front lawn and decided that I should put one more on the garage door.

*“Jim Was My Soulmate.”*

It wasn’t true, I just knew it would piss her off. I hated Jim because he was a lie, just like her.

I hated her for many things. Defacing my parent’s house was now the latest. The cop in the cruiser across the street was speaking into his radio while he kept an eye on me. I heard a familiar voice coming from my left.

“Amy? What are you doing to your mother’s house?” Homer was standing at the edge of his lawn. 

No coffee cup. 

No Joe. 

I had never seen Homer without Joe. Ever.

“Morning, Homer.”

“Honey, you really shouldn’t do that to your mom’s house?”

“Where’s Joe?”

“Oh, she’s inside. Why don’t you come over and have some coffee with us. You look like you need some company.” He smiled.

“I can’t. I’m waiting on someone.”

“Obviously.” The space between us seemed to narrow. I didn’t like his smile. He was closer to my front door than I was. I left the syringe inside, and I had nothing to defend myself with. I was being too arrogant.

“When do you expect your friend to show up?”

“They should be along soon.”

“I see. Well, I hope you have a good time. Just come on over if you want some company.” 

He didn’t move. I was trying to keep my breathing steady while I walked past him. He kept smiling.

I locked the door and ran for the syringe and put it in the front pocket of my sweatshirt.

\-

Later that night, I had a cigarette on the porch. Homer and Joe never came out with their decaf. I thought about telling the cop across the street, but if it was Lilith, there was no point. They were already gone. 

\-

The smell of the paint thinner, detergent, and gasoline was growing stronger as time went on. I needed to hide the smell.

I started smoking inside the house and burning every one of my mothers candles. I emptied every bottle of perfume she had on the furniture and I was constantly spritzing my sweatshirt pocket with Febreze. It was almost impossible to breathe in the house.

I waited inside. No more going outside. 

I got rid of every clock and threw them in the garage. I made sure no light was coming through the windows. Time didn’t mean anything. There was only this house. There was only the waiting. I thought of Kurt Vonnegut.

*“Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.”*

\-

The only gauge of time I had was the way I smelled. From my pits, I figured it was at least three days. I hoped she was going just as crazy as I was. I didn’t know what was going on out there, and she had no idea what was going on inside, but I had to be realistic. I was going to fall asleep, and I knew that when she finally came in this time, it was going to be for keeps.

A stalker’s game only lasts so long before they decide to end it.

I stayed next to the kitchen. Next to my trap.

I had to stay awake.

Had to stay awake.

Stay awake.

Awake…

\-

Someone was shaking me. She was inside. I had fallen asleep while I was standing next to the bar.

I felt the steel in my front pocket.

“Mam? Mam?”

My eyes shot open. Pete was in his uniform and he was shaking me. His hands were on me. His face was next to mine. He was smiling.

I pulled the injector out of my pocket and drove it into his forearm, but he threw me against the bar before I could push the plunger.

“DADGUMMIT! What the hell are you…”

I had my back to the bar while I slid around it. I was still trying to get my eyes to focus. I was trying to think. I had to get to the oven. He plucked the injector out of his arm. “You thought… oh my Lord, you were gonna…” 

He started walking towards me.

“Ok, now wait a minute. It’s really me. I know what you told me, but I just couldn’t leave you here alone. I hadn’t seen you for a few days and I just wanted to check on you.” 

I made it around the bar and backed up to the counter, but he was still walking towards me. I felt for the liter bottle behind me on the counter, and when I found it, I unscrewed the cap with one hand. My head was pounding. I could smell the gas and soap. I felt like I was in a dream.

“Charlie’s fine. I got him with my girlfriend’s parents. Really good people. They’re regulars over at the First Baptist on Gettysburg.”

“How did you get in, Pete?” I was shaking. This was it.

“Your dad gave me a key.”

“He would never do that.”

“He trusted me. I can prove it to you. The key’s still in the deadbolt if you wanna come take a look. Come here.”

The oven was right behind me, and I was trying to figure out how to get him closer. 

It was Lilith. It had to be.

“Mam. I’m not going to hurt you.” He stood still and held out the injector. I looked him over for any little thing I might have missed. I wasn’t going to take it from his hand.

He put it on the counter and slid it next to me. He backed away into the family room.

“I just wanted to check on you is all. I swear, I’m Pete. I’m not gonna hurt you. I’ll just stand right here.”

I grabbed the injector and started to cry.

“I can’t do this anymore… I’m losing my mind. Why don’t you just kill me and get it over with?”

“Mam, you got to believe me.”

I heard another voice. A shout. Pete’s head moved to the front door.

“What are you doing in here?!” Detective Hopkins walked in and stood in front of Pete, looking him up and down. I put the injector back into the pocket of my sweatshirt.

“Officer Avery! You are not supposed to leave your post!”

“Yes sir. I’m sorry sir, I just…”

“Now, Avery! Out!”

Pete ran out of the house and the detective turned his attention to me. I was shaking. Wiping my eyes.

He was walking towards me.

“My God, it smells in here. I was going to ask how you were, but I think I know the answer.”

If that really was Pete, I was ready to kill him. If it really was the detective, how was I supposed to know? I was suddenly terrified that I was accidentally going to kill an innocent person. I was breaking down. I was finally at the end of my rope.

Lilith had won.

I was laughing and crying. My hand gripped the injector and I thought about using it on myself just to end everything.



Hopkins was trying to calm me down. He was getting closer. All I could do was cry. He was there to take me to the station for more questioning. He threatened to arrest me if I didn’t come willingly. 

He stopped just short of me being able to stick him, but at that point, I wasn’t going to. I didn’t want to hurt anybody.

I was done.

“I’m so tired, Detective.”

“Well, come with me, and we’ll see if you feel a little safer.”

“Ok.”

Through the tears, I saw the little thing. The one thing that helped me pull it back together.

There was no coffee stain on his shirt.

It was something. I could have been wrong, but it helped me get control of myself. 

I had to think of something else, and it wasn’t hard. 

If it was Lilith, I knew what would get her to show her true colors.

If she did show her true colors, I knew how I was going to show her mine.

“I never should have left her.”

“Excuse me?”

“I’d give anything to go back to the night we met. I’ve ruined everything. I could have had a life with her.”

I saw another little thing, but I was looking for it. An almost imperceptible twitch. 

A suppressed smile.

It was Lilith.

“She’s always been my everything. I never wanted any of this to happen. I’m so stupid.” I sobbed and Hopkins moved toward me. I put out my right hand towards him like I wanted him to hold me, while my left was stuffed in my pocket. Hopkins hesitated for only a moment. I figured that Lilith would want to feel my pain. 

I figured correctly.

“Mrs. Taylor, it’s going to be alright.” Hopkins grabbed my hand. He studied my face, while I studied his.

I saw the look of realization. 

Lilith realized that she had been played. His face turned to a scowl and I pulled my hand away before I could be injected with anything.

“Amy, you bitch!” Lilith’s voice.

“MAM?! MAM?!” 

Both of us looked towards the door. Pete had run back in, screaming for me. Hopkins turned back to me as I stabbed the injector into his neck and pushed the plunger down.

Five seconds.

Pete was yelling at me to step back. Detective Hopkin’s face was spasming into a display of pain. I turned my back.

Four seconds.

I turned the knobs on all the burners. Lilith was screaming and flailing. 

Three seconds.

It was half Hopkins and half Lilith. I grabbed the two liter bottle full of food coloring, gas, and detergent and shook it.

Two seconds.

I squeezed the bottle, and all the nasty goop inside covered the suit that Lilith was wearing. It doused her face. I grabbed her by the suit. My hands were wet.

One second.

“Soulmates my ass.” I spit in Lilith’s face. I used every bit of strength I had and spun her around me and into the stove. The side of her face crashed down on it from the momentum.

Lilith erupted in flames, and so did my hands while I held onto the suit jacket.

For just one moment, I could see her eyes before her face was gone. She was afraid.

I felt the sensation of floating backwards, away from Lilith. Pete had pulled me away and ripped the blanket from the sliding glass window. The family room was filled with sunlight. Pete was patting me down. Lilith was screaming.

I only got glimpses through the blanket. Lilith ran through the family room. Pete was praying to Jesus that he could put me out. I was laughing.

\-

When Pete was convinced I was out and the house wasn’t on fire, he helped me to my feet. I could smell my own burned flesh and the smell of whatever the hell Lilith was.

We walked to the front porch. Lilith was lying still on the lawn. I lit a cigarette and offered one to Pete. We both sat on the steps while we watched Lilith burn down to nothing. Sirens were somewhere close.

“How did you know?”

“What do you mean Mam?”

“How did you know it was her?”

“It hit me just when I was about to sit in the cruiser. Nobody calls me Avery. That’s my Dad’s name.”

I kissed him on his forehead.

“You did good, Pete.”

We couldn’t stop laughing as the firetruck pulled up.

It was over.

\-

I was sitting in the hometown dive bar and Charlie was on the seat across from me. I saw a lot of people I remembered from highschool. They were avoiding me. The crazy bitch that killed someone and almost burnt down her parents house.

That was fine. I just wanted to blend into the background. I had sat down in the darkest booth I could find. The bright white bandages on my hands and over my left eye stood out in the shadows. They were the last burns I would ever have to deal with.

I was doing my best to clear their shelf of bourbon. I was in sweatpants, no bra, and the ratty sweatshirt I had killed Lilith in. I had to wash it twice to get rid of the smell of gas and burnt Lilith.

My parents were at the hotel with Jessica while their kitchen and carpet were being replaced. They were safe and Charlie and I were celebrating.

“Where do we go from here, Charlie?”

He cocked his head and grumbled.

“I don’t know either.”

I lit a cigarette and a song came on the jukebox. It was my favorite band, singing Lilith’s favorite song. 



*“All messed up with nowhere to go,*

 *I stare at myself in the mirror alone.*

*It’s hard to make friends when you’re half in the grave,*

*But I ain’t dead yet.*

*And I’ve got something to say*

*Oh-Ohh yeah.”*

I watched the inside of the bar, but I couldn’t see her anywhere. I turned and looked behind me, and when I turned around again, he was there.

“Hi.” He had a deep voice and he was tall. A Carhartt jacket, jeans, and boots. God, he was hot.

“Hi.”

“You seem like you could really use someone to talk to. Can I sit down?”

I smiled and I looked at Charlie. He cocked his head and told me he thought that would be alright.

“Sure.”

Kevin fished around in Castle’s pockets and retrieved the keys to his truck. Castle’s incoherent moaning picked-up a little while Kevin was searching him.

*I could end up like that*, I thought\*. All it takes is for some other player to gently tap me. Is that what death is like here? Is it worse than oblivion because I’ll stay in that semi-conscious state forever?\*

I followed Kevin into the parking lot. He handed me the Castle’s keys. “Okay, here’s the plan –“

“Woah – you want me to drive this thing? I can’t do that.”

He pointed to his crown, “King.” He rapped on my helmet like he was knocking on a door. “Pawn.”

I sighed and yanked the keys from his hand. “I don’t even know how to drive a -“

“The plan,” he interrupted. “Listen. There are two key elements to the plan. One – you drive this thing north, to Rankate Park. Two – and this is the key part of the plan - make bad decisions. You have to do what you do best which is to make terrible decisions.”

“That’s not even a plan! That’s just … “ I struggled to find the words. “That’s just you insulting me in a parking lot.”

“North!” he said. “Rankate Park! Bad decisions.” Then he spun around and marched back into the E6.

I climbed into the cab of the truck. I’d never been in the cab of an eighteen-wheeler before. The steering wheel was huge, and was mounted on the dash at a weird flat angle. The shifter looked like some kind of puzzle with three reverse gears and a ten or so forward gears. The dash had five times the number of gauges than a regular car.

Castle had positioned the driver’s seat so far back that my feet didn’t event brush the pedals. I fumbled around for a few seconds before I figured out how to slide it forward. A chess piece – a rook - was stuck to the dashboard with a suction cup. I pulled it off and tossed it on the passenger seat. This was my truck now. A pawn’s truck.

I found the ignition and turned it on.

The truck rumbled to life. The deep growl under the hood had a heaviness to it, like I was about to drive one of the Earth’s tectonic plates instead of a vehicle. I said what I’m guessing everyone says the first time they sit in the driver’s seat of a big rig.

“Oh *Yeah*…”

I smirked the smirk of someone about take control of something that could generate far more power than they could control, and put the truck into first gear.

The truck stalled as soon as I eased my foot off the clutch. I messed with the shifter and tried again. Stall. I moved the shifter through its little labyrinth of gear positions to make sure I had it in the first gear. Stall. I honked the horn, just to make me feel like I was in control of something, then I messed with the lever on the shifter. This time the truck slowly crawled forward when I hit the gas.

I steered towards the ramp from the E6 parking lot to the northbound side of the highway. I shifted twice more before I reached the road, but was still only moving about fifteen miles an hour despite being in third gear.

I managed to get the truck up to a normal highway speed with only a few severe gear grinding incidents. I imagined Castle, still writhing and moaning on the floor of the E6 travel store emitting tearful whimpers of pain each time I ground the gears on his truck.

I found the control for the windshield wipers. I figured out how to turn on the headlights. In my button-pushing and switch-flipping I accidentally turned on the sound system. Evil-sounding German industrial metal music blasted into the cab. The relentlessly driving industrial metal filled me with confidence and I shifted through three more gears, getting the truck up to seventy or so. Was this what Castle was listening to when he decided to ram Kevin and I? Soon I was singing along, even though I had no idea what the German words meant.

*""Got vise ish vil kine Engel zine.""*

I passed a sign:

*Rankate park: 2 miles*.

I had almost completed the first phase of Kevin’s “plan.” I started to ponder the second part, where I was supposed to make bad decisions. Is it even possible to wisely make a bad choice? Is planning to have a bad plan a paradox?

The trees surrounding the highway thinned, then were suddenly gone entirely as the highway crossed a stretch of farmland. The rain stopped abruptly. The clouds thinned and the light of the full moon washed away the night's impenetrable gloom. Was this new landscape and new weather a sign that I had I crossed into a new cell on the grid?

Beyond the fields, it seemed the world ended. The road traced a path between the fields into an immense dark void beyond. I let off the gas a bit as I tried to understand what was beyond the fields. Was the void *the black edge of the board* that Kevin told me about at the party?

I drove past another sign:

*Rankate Park: 1 mile.*

*No Beach Access*

I laughed at myself for a moment. The endless darkness beyond the fields was just the ocean. I stepped on the gas again to get back up to highway speeds.

There was movement to my left. Someone passing me? I checked the driver-side mirror and saw nothing but empty highway behind me. I looked out into the field to my left. Something was out there. It was a monster. No, correction, *she* was a monster.

I didn’t think “oh, a monster,” right away, of course. The human brain doesn’t work that way when it encounters something new. The visual system needs a second to grasp what it sees. It hands over its results to the cortex, which has to think things through a bit. Once the cortex ponders it for bit, and understands just how “wrong” what its seeing is, the limbic system takes over. The limbic system needs another half-second-or-so to figure out that “fear” is the right response. Well, in my case, terror was what it dialed up.

At first I thought the large object in the field to the left of the road was a dilapidated structure – maybe a half-demolished grain silo or water tank. But no. It was moving. Not just traveling forward, parallel to the road, but running at the same speed as the truck.

It was maybe twenty feet tall – too large to be any kind of normal animal. As I more fully processed what I was seeing, I saw that it *wasn’t* running, exactly. It was galloping. No not even galloping– galloping is something that creatures with four legs do. This thing had more than four legs. Six? Probably more. It was hard to tell because it was wearing a *dress*.

It – she – whatever - was human-like, in that she was wearing clothes, had legs, a torso, arms, and a head all arranged in the normal vertical way that we humans are organized. Her human-like arms were attached at the shoulders, but there were way too many of them. She had eight arms.

Her head was a grotesque oversized mass. A human head scaled up to hold eight separate faces, each looking out from the eight main compass points. The resemblance to the eight-faced horror version of myself I saw in the reflection of the window and the rear-view mirror was obvious. One difference between her eight-faced abomination of a head and what I saw of my own in the mirror is that she wore an enormous crown of steel spikes. This thing, this *person*, had to be the queen. The black queen.

I startled as the truck drifted over the rumble strip on the right side of the road and onto the shoulder, I overcorrected, sending the truck into the center of the road. The queen also heard the truck hit the rumble strip. She turned her head slightly and sneered at me with two of her faces. Her faces – the two that looked at me anyway - reminded me of the Statue of Liberty. They had a similar dingy tarnish, like she was wearing greenish-grey makeup. Both faces bore the same resting-bitch-face scowl as Ms. Liberty.

The queen turned slightly to her right, smashed through the left-side guard rail, and ran onto the highway. I slammed on the brakes and slid to a stop in the center of the road. The queen continued her strange, arhythmic, loping run, rapidly moving away from me down the center of the road.

The face on the 180-degree rear of the queen’s head looked directly at me and shouted something I could not hear from inside Castle’s cab. She slowed to a jog, and then a complete stop. Behind her, the road opened into a parking lot. A park-sign-brown sign on the side of the road announced that the road ended at Rankate Park.

We stayed there, staring at each other. Me, sitting in the cab, listening to Castle’s insane German Industrial Metal. A hundred yards ahead, at the entrance to the Rankate parking lot, the 20-foot-tall, many-limbed, eight-faced queen stared back at me. Behind her, the paved parking lot ended at what looked like an observation area overlooking the ocean, a hundred feet or so below us.

*…Make bad decisions…*

Kevin’s voice floated through my consciousness. A demented, acid-trip version of Obi-Wan telling Luke to use The Force.

I could try ramming her, I thought. The truck is really powerful, so that might be a good idea. No, I mentally corrected myself, I need bad ideas, not good ones.

We stared at each other for three or four songs. From time to time she would turn her head slightly so that another face would have a chance to glare at me. But other than the dirty looks, she did nothing. It must be my move.

I looked around the cab of Castle’s truck. Was there anything here that could help me? Some clue as to how this weird world behaved? I didn’t see anything other than what I assumed was the usual trucker stuff: maps, coffee cups, a clipboard with some kind of cargo manifest. What kind of cargo was Castle hauling, anyway? Is there, like, an economy here? Was he making a delivery? I grabbed the clipboard and tried to make sense of it. It was just a list of coded and abbreviated items: PT, CF, 1 gross, pallet.

I unbuckled my seatbelt and cracked the driver’s door open. The queen didn’t move. I opened the door and swung myself out onto the footplate. Nothing from the queen. I jumped down to the pavement, still focused on the queen. She turned her head to glare at me with a new face, but was otherwise motionless.

I walked to the back of the truck, and scrambled up the metal bars that functioned as the trailer’s rear bumper. I fumbled with the door handle for a bit, but finally got the door to swing open. I scrambled inside. I had to open the second door to let enough light in to see the cargo clearly. Castle was hauling about ten pallets of Cosmic Fudge flavored Pop Tarts.

I strolled the length of the trailer interior to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. I wasn’t. Just ten pallets of Pop Tarts – all Cosmic Fudge flavored – and pallet jack lashed to the wall.

*Bad decisions*. I needed bad ideas to make bad decisions. I thought. Nothing came to mind. I stopped thinking and just acted. I unlashed the pallet jack from the trailer wall and rolled it to doorway. I slid the tines under the pallet next to the door and pushed it to the edge of the trailer. It didn’t weight much – a gross of crates of Pop Tarts is only a hundred-fifty pounds or so. I maneuvered the pallet so it was hanging off the edge of the trailer, slid the jack out, and then pushed hard on the load of plastic-wrapped Pop-Tart boxes. The pallet of Pop Tarts rolled out of the truck and spilled onto the road.

I worked the pallet jack under the next pallet and did the same thing. I thought I heard a gasp, or maybe a shout from the queen. I worked quickly, pushing the rest of the pallets out of the truck. I expected to see the queen’s huge, eight-faced head appear in the doorway at any moment, ready to take me out. But she didn’t show up. It was still my move.

I hopped down from the trailer and walked back to the cab. The Queen was still in her position by the Rankate Park sign. Still glaring at me.

“What do you think you are doing!” she shouted from the face that was most-directly looking at me. “I’ll have your head for this!” Her voice was not what I expected. I thought she would sound “Queen like” – she’d have a snobby upper-class British accent. But she was American. From Boston, maybe?

I climbed into the cab and put the truck into gear. This time, I knew what I was doing and I didn’t have any embarrassing stall outs. I rolled the truck forward about fifty feet.

The queen began shouting again. I couldn’t hear what she said. I figured out how to turn off the Castle’s heavy metal music and I opened the driver’s window. “What?” I shouted back?

“You pathetic pawn. Just because you stole a truck, it doesn’t mean you’re a rook. I’ll bite your head off!”

I leaned out the window to make sure she’d hear me. “You mean, you’d actually chew on my head? That’s pretty gross!”

“It’s a figure of speech, pawny pants!” There was that stupid insult again. “But this one,” she used three of her arms to point at the face on the left side of her head, “she’s a little bit off, you know. She might actually do it!”

I put the truck into reverse and rolled it backwards towards the pile of Pop Tarts.

“My Tarts!” the Queen screamed. “My Tarts! Stop! You’ll ruin them!”

I smiled and kept rolling slightly backwards. *Your move*, I thought. I had a bad feeling about my plan. But it was a familiar bad feeling. The same feeling I had just before I attended my cousin’s super-formal wedding barefoot. Or when I tried to arm-wrestle the bouncer at O’Flanagan’s. Or when I did a million other stupid things. I was doing what came naturally – making bad decisions.

The Queen launched herself into a sprint directly at the truck. If you’ve got six or eight legs, you can really get some good acceleration. She screamed at me, literally and figuratively, as she rushed the truck.

For a moment, I thought she was going to take me out. And that she was going to do it in a much more violent and bloody way than I did when I took out Castle. I’d have to face oblivion, lying on the road next to the park. But she didn’t take me out. She raced past the cab – the face on the right side of her head spit at me as she passed – and stopped at rear of the trailer.

“My Tarts!” she screamed again.

The truck stopped rolling backwards. I looked in the driver-side mirror and saw the Queen leaning into the trailer, pushing it forwards, away from the tarts, with all the force she had in her collection of sixteen limbs.

I put the truck in a forward gear and stomped on the gas. I rolled forward slowly at first, then faster and faster. In the mirror, the Queen fell behind as the truck moved away from the pile of her precious Pop Tarts.

I shifted gears, then shifted again. I blasted past the Rankate Park sign with the engine screaming. I accelerated through the parking lot, towards the observation point. A sign that said “Viewing area. Caution, steep drop off” was planted directly in front of me.

*Make Bad Decisions*

I flattened the sign and kept the truck rolling forward. Through the safety railing and into the void beyond.

For a moment, the cab stayed level as it flew off the cliff. Then it pitched downwards as the forces of gravity and the cantilever of the trailer the trailer rolled me towards the ocean below. I saw the dark water churning at the base of a rocky cliff. *The Black Edge of the Board*, I thought.

Then I was standing on the ground. I was in park’s viewing area looking out over the ocean as the truck crashed onto the rocks below and rolled into the surf.

I felt dizzy. I took a step back from edge. Eight legs moved me in a coordinated but inhuman motion to where I wanted to be. “Wha….” I began to speak, and heard eight different versions of my voice.

I remembered my conversation with Kevin at the party. Only hours ago:

*“Chess, right?” Kevin had said. “You know what happens when a pawn makes it to the other side?”*

*“Yeah, it turns into a queen. The most badass piece on the board.”*

Pawn Promotion. I had been promoted. I was a …

I looked at my arms – all eight of them. I was a Queen.

I came back from a holiday around Europe for my 16th 4 weeks ago and had around 3 days of school to occupy myself (I started and finished 2 assignments that didn't need to be done because I wanted something to focus on; I ended up going overkill for both lol)

Now I have like 5 weeks of basically nothing. Apart from going out for lunch on Christmas and going out to see family on Boxing Day, I have **nothing** to do. I have some basic stuff to do like a game material collection table and finishing off some designs, but nothing that I have will last 5 weeks.

I'm just wondering if there's anything low budget that I can do either at home or going out. I'm going to try and have a serious talk to my mum about going out more since I even like just accompanying my dad to get his coffee down at the beach. I'm not fussy and I can answer any clarifying questions needed. I appreciate all the help I can get, as I just want something to focus on whilst on my Vyvanse (I don't want to not take it as I'm horribly unmotivated and lazy if I do; I just sit and watch YouTube all day which is awful. Going on my holiday made me realise how lazy I am and it's made me want to be more active).",0,1734832028.0,adhdaustralia,0,0.33,False

Lilith was driving me to the edge. I was white knuckled on a rollercoaster with no breaks, and I was starting to go off the rails. No one could help me. 

I screamed and pleaded and begged, but she wasn’t going to let me off.

The only way off was to be with her. To give her what she wanted.

I was so fucking ready to give in.

I still can’t believe I didn’t give in.

\-

Charlie had his head in my lap with his tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth. He was panting so hard, but he was still talking to me. Charlie never stopped talking to me. He kept talking right until the end.

Daddy was driving fast and the old truck was rattling louder than it normally did as we flew down the road. I saw a bunch of other kids playing outside and I wished I was them. I wished I didn’t have to be doing what I was doing.

Daddy kept wiping his eyes. I saw him cry. I don’t know if it was because he was sad for Charlie, or because he knew there was nothing he could do to help his little girl.

\-

I saw our reflection in the glass doors as we went into the vet’s office. I was running to keep up with Daddy, and Charlie was hanging limply in his arms. His tail wasn’t moving. That wooden pocket watch that Daddy had made and painted gold, hung down from the blue ribbon around Charlie’s neck.

With each step, it swung back and forth like a pendulum. The minutes were counting down.

All dogs go to heaven, but those are hollow words when you’re watching them go through hell.

\-

The table. The damned cold metal table. I didn’t want Charlie to have to lay on it, so I took off my jacket and put it underneath him. He kept talking to me. His voice was tired, but I think he was trying to tell me it was going to be ok. He kept moving his head and licking the tears off of my face. His body was shaking.

The doctor told me and Daddy that there was nothing he could do. Charlie was sick. Charlie was old. The doctor left.

Daddy put his head next to mine. His strong voice was breaking while my old dog was dying.

“Baby. We have to let him go. He’s hurting really bad.”

“Can’t we get him some medicine?”

“Medicine isn’t going to help him anymore, baby.”

I put my face up against Charlie’s. I had never known life without my dog. I was eight, and I didn’t want to know life without him.

“Charlie, please don’t leave me.” 

The doctor came back in with a needle.

I hate needles. They do bad things.

I heard Charlie start to bark, but it was coming from somewhere far away.

“He’s barking Daddy!”

The doctor was petting my dog while he held the needle next to his leg.

Charlie was barking somewhere.

“Daddy. He’s better now! Don’t let the doctor do it!”

The doctor pushed that awful needle into my friend. 

Charlie was barking somewhere.

“Daddy, make him stop! Charlie’s better now! I can hear him!” 

I was standing outside of myself. I saw my dad petting my head while I was petting my dog. Charlie’s eyes were locked onto mine. He knew what was about to happen.

Charlie talked for just a second and then he was quiet. He stopped moving. He peed on the metal table.

He was still barking somewhere.

My Daddy whispered in my ear.

“It’s gonna be ok, baby. The sun’s gonna come up tomorrow. You just try and get some sleep.” He kissed my neck just behind my ear.

My neck burned. Charlie was barking. 

Daddy was frozen. I was frozen.

I wanted to scream. I couldn’t move. His lips were setting my neck on fire.

I could hear the dog trying to get in the sliding glass window.

\-

I woke up in pain. Jessica was stirring in my arms. We were sleeping on an air mattress on my parents' bedroom floor. I got up slowly, trying not to cry out in agony. My parents were still asleep. 

I hoped they were still my parents.

I ran to the bathroom, turned on the shower, and ducked my head underneath the cold water and I felt the raised skin on the back of my neck with my fingers. The burning was turning into a dull ache.

I opened the drawer and grabbed the small mirror and held it to the back of my neck so I could see it in the larger mirror.

There was a new burn. Lilith had kissed me while I was asleep. Her lips had burned into me and left me with another scar. 

\-

For two days, I couldn’t sleep. I showed my parents the burn. The cops took pictures of it. They all reassured me that Lilith couldn’t have gotten inside.

I was constantly asking my mom and dad questions from my youth that only they would know the answer to. I second guessed myself over and over, trying to remember exactly which stories I had told Lilith about growing up.

I felt like I had told her everything. She might have had all the right answers.

\-

I was constantly looking for any sign of how Lilith could have slipped inside the house. The winking cop from the cruiser outside kept walking around the outside of my parents house, but he couldn’t find any sign that she had been there either. At least, that’s what he told my father. How was I supposed to trust him?

\-

Detective Hopkins came by on the second day and we talked out on the porch. The sun was just starting to go down and Homer and Joe were sitting on their porch next door, drinking their cups of decaf pretending that they weren’t listening to every word. 

I noticed another coffee stain on Hopkin’s shirt. He seemed different than he was before. His blue eyes were colder. 

“Evening, Amy. You look like you’re not getting any rest.”

“I’m not.” 

“Well, it’s probably best that you try.”

“Looks like you still haven’t fixed that hole in your lip.” His eyes darted down to the stain.

“Son of a bitch.” He moved his tie to the left, trying to cover the stain. There was no smile, just a stone face. “Alright, where do I start? We got the results back from the blood tests.”

“Ok.”

“Nothing. Everything was normal for both you and the deceased.”

“Detective, I’m telling you that she drugged us both with something.”

“Well, the tests say something else.”

“What about my neck? She had to have drugged me to do that, right?”

“Amy, there’s no evidence that anyone broke into the house.”

“Well how the hell did she burn me then?!” 

An awkward pause.

“You don’t think I’m doing it to myself, do you?”

“Listen. I need you to tell me what really happened in that bar. I need you to tell me how that man died.” 

“I told you what happened.”

“Amy, I’m going to figure out what’s going on here very soon. It’d be a lot easier if you were just straight with me. I already know what he died from, I’m just trying to figure out how it happened while he was sitting across a table from you in a crowded bar.”

For the rest of the conversation, it was obvious that I was now a suspect.

Lilith was laughing somewhere.

\-

I couldn’t see a way out. Everyone thought I was nuts, or worse. My life was over.

The second day was over.

I had no idea what she was going to do next.

\-

I tried my best to keep my head clear, but that’s difficult when you think you’re being investigated for murder. I couldn’t trust anyone anymore. I wanted to believe my parents were ok. I even doubted that Jessica was herself.

I was mourning the loss of my daughter and holding her close to me at the same time.

The third and fourth days just began to run into one another. 

No word at all from Lilith.

My body was trying to force me to sleep, and the few times I almost gave in, but the dog would always start barking and slapping his paws against the glass door.

I went through moments when I thought the dog somehow knew when I was about to fall asleep, and that he was trying to help me stay awake. Then I went through moments when I thought it was Lilith posing as the dog, making me stay awake. Trying to drive me crazy.

Either way, I was losing it.

\-

I knew my body was going to betray me. Eventually I was going to crash. I was drinking coffee constantly, and walking laps through the house, but my brain finally lost the battle.

I had fallen asleep at the dinner table and my father had carried me to my bed. The only thing I remember from that night was the constant barking.

When I woke up, there was a new burn on my right calf.

\-

I didn’t say anything to the cops, but it was obvious what my parents thought. They thought I was doing it to myself, they just didn’t know how. My mother had taken out the cleaning chemicals from underneath all of the sinks.

My father put a padlock on the door to the garage.

They didn’t say anything. They didn’t have to. It was only a matter of time before they would make the decision to put me in a hospital.

They both asked me not to tell Detective Hopkins about it.

I had to hold it together. I had to put forward a sane face. I had to figure out some way of ridding myself of Lilith and it would start with the damn necklace.

\-

I took the picture frame that I had made, and the necklace and walked into the backyard.

The dog was out there waiting for me; just staring at me while I threw Lilith’s shit inside of the garbage can. I walked over to him, but he didn’t move. I stopped within a couple feet of him.

“Are you really a dog?”

He walked to me and put his front paw on my leg.

He looked so much like Charlie, but I couldn’t touch him.

She knew about my dog.

\-

I could hear Jessica through the wall, laughing in the backyard. My mom would make the old dog sit while Jessica would go and hide, then my mom would say “sic ‘em!” and the dog would run and find Jessica.

“He’s finding me grandma! I can’t hide!”

They were doing it over and over.

I was in the bath staring at the ceiling. I kept tracing the mark Lilith had given me on my neck with my fingers. I kept staring at the one on my calf. 

I was working out the problem. I needed to make her go away. How could I make her go away? I was accepting the fact that I couldn’t. I had no control.

The white ceiling became the perfect background for the images going through my mind. My memory kept going back to an awful video that Jim had asked me to watch. 

A jar with a crab inside of it was submerged into a tank with an octopus.

The octopus wrapped a tentacle around the jar and slowly pulled it closer, while the crab inside was pushing against the glass, helpless to get out. The octopus climbed on top and all of its tentacles draped down the sides of the jar, while the crab struggled inside. The body of the octopus twitched and undulated while it unscrewed the lid and then discarded it. Its entire body squeezed inside of the jar and descended over its meal.

The crab never had a chance.

My eyes fluttered and I fell asleep.

\-

I saw Lilith standing on the roof of our house. Her body melted and it began to run down from the roof and cover our entire home. I saw my family banging on the windows inside, screaming until the house was completely covered in a milky film that twitched and pulasted.

It devoured everything.

\-

I woke up in the tub; the water had drained. I had no idea how long I had dozed off. My body was numb, but my right leg was burning.

It was high up on my inner thigh; another kiss from Lilith.

I was weeping silently in the empty tub. I couldn’t let anyone hear me. I couldn’t tell anyone.

I stayed there until my head felt clear; until whatever she was drugging me with wore off.

The door was locked. The only window was a small one above the tub that looked out on the backyard.

I wondered how she could have possibly got in.

My eyes moved to the narrow metal vent on the wall just below the ceiling. The paint looked slightly blistered.

I wondered if she was behind it, watching me.

I could hear my father talking to someone in the dining room.

I listened to my mom and my daughter playing with their new friend. They had been out there the whole time, all three of them. 

Unless Lilith was all of them, she couldn’t be any of them. At least, that’s what passed for reasoning in my exhausted mind.

By the time I could move, I knew what I was going to do next.

\-

I tried my best to stay calm.

I had a role to play, and if I was being watched, I needed to sell it.

My dad was sitting at the kitchen table with the winking cop from outside, and they were both having a cup of coffee and talking about the Cowboys. I walked past them and opened the sliding glass door. Jessica was asking the dog to sit in exchange for Vienna Sausages while my mom was laughing. The dog was talking and his tail never stopped moving.

“Jessica. Get back inside the house please.”

“I’m just feeding Charlie, Mommy! He’s a good boy!”

I walked out onto the lawn and snatched her by her wrist and pulled her away from the dog.

“You’re hurting me!” I didn’t listen. My mother was telling me to calm down as I led Jessica back inside.

“You are not to go outside of this house, do you understand me?!” She was crying. “Jessica?!”

“I was just playing with Charlie!”

“That thing is not Charlie! Go to your room!” Jessica was sobbing as she ran down the hall. My mother shot me a look as she walked past me and followed Jessica. I locked the sliding glass door while the bony old dog was doing his best to lick every bit of grease he could out of the empty can of sausages that Jessica had dropped.

“Amy. You need to calm down.”

I turned to my dad. The cop was staring at the floor. He was very young and he looked very uncomfortable.

“Why is he inside?”

“Honey, this is Officer Avery.”

“Um, Pete.” He looked at my eyes, but then quickly looked away.

“I just thought he could use a break from sitting in his car.”

I stared at them both without saying a word until the kid in a police uniform thanked my dad for the coffee and left.

“That was a little drastic, don’t you think?”

“I want that thing gone, Dad.”

“What thing? Pete or the dog?”

“The dog. You all need to stay inside the house. You can’t let anybody in.”

He walked over to me.

“Ok. You wanna know something? I never liked Lilith. I just smiled and nodded my head most of the time because she was your friend, but I could see something in her eyes that made me feel like I was looking at a bad person. Same thing with Jim. I probably should have said something about both of them, but I didn’t.”

“Dad…”

“Well I’m going to say something now. There’s nothing wrong with that dog and he ain’t going anywhere because my granddaughter already went and fell in love with him. Pete’s a nice kid, and if I want to invite a nice kid into my home for coffee, I’m going to.”

“Dad…” 

“You know he comes back even when his shift is over? Sits out there in his car on his own time. Good kid. I love you and I know you’re scared, but that was over the line. If I were you, I’d go in there and apologize to my daughter.”

He walked down the hall and left me.

\-

I walked into the backyard and opened the back gate that led out onto the street. The dog watched me the entire time. I hoped I was right. I needed to be right.

“Charlie.” I whispered. He cocked his head. “He had to name you Charlie, didn’t he? Come here.” I lifted my pant leg and let him sniff at the sore on my calf.

“Good boy. Now sic ‘em! Sic ‘em!”

The dog ran out of the back gate, barking like mad as if he was chasing something. I followed him. 

Pete was watching me as I ran through the front yard like a crazy person. The dog was standing on the other side of the house and looking up. 

He was barking at the metal vent at the top of the house. 

I walked over as if I saw nothing. I tried to only take quick glances at the metal vent and the blistered paint on the outside of it.

“Charlie! Come here!”

I walked him into the backyard. He was yammering along, telling me in his own way what he had been barking at.

I went back inside.

Lilith had been near me the entire time, not posing as one of my family, but hiding in our attic.

\-

“No. No way.” I knew my dad was going to argue with me. 

“Dad please. I need you to go away. I need you guys out of the house.”

“This is insane.”

The dog was in the family room with my mother and Jessica. I insisted that they all stay in the same room. I had convinced my dad to go into the garage with me. There were no attic vents in the garage. I hoped that Lilith wouldn’t hear our conversation.

“I know you and mom are thinking I’m doing these things to myself. I’m not. Right now, I know that all of you are ok. I NEED to know you guys are ok. I need you to drive somewhere. I don’t want to know where you’re going to go, but you don’t come back until I call you. I’ll figure out how to fix this.”

“Fix this? Let’s say you’re not confused. Let’s say you’re right about everything. What are you gonna do? Kill her?”

“Yeah.” He sighed and looked at the ceiling.

“This is crazy… so damn crazy. Ok! If you’re right, how am I supposed to know that it’s you who’s calling me?”

“Because I’ll tell you that I saw you crying when we drove Charlie to the vet to put him down. I’ve never told anyone that. Daddy, please. Please.”

“Ok.”

“Just one thing.”

“What?”

“Take the lock off of the garage.”

\-

They were gone. I was sitting on the front porch having a cigarette and the dog was next to me. It was getting cold and I could see the cop sitting in his cruiser staring at me in the darkness. I had the porch light off, and my mom’s little solar lights on the walkway were barely giving off any light.

A little bit behind the cruiser, Pete was in his own car dressed in plain clothes. He was asleep in his seat when I came out, but he woke up when I closed the front door behind me.

I watched him trying to act like he wasn’t looking at me.

I wanted to be outside. I felt like I couldn’t think inside of  the house. I couldn’t think while Lilith’s eyes might be watching me. I had filled my dad’s old metal thermos full of coffee, and I was halfway through it when my phone vibrated.

“Amy?”

“Lilith?”

“So you figured out where I was. Good for you. Always so smart. Did you feel me looking back at you? I’m not there anymore.”

An awkward pause.

“Nothing to say?”

Another.

“Amy?”

She always hated awkward pauses.

“Amy, you better answer me…”

“Or you’ll do what you sick fuck? Did you follow my family? I don’t think so. I think you’d be too afraid I’d run somewhere and you couldn’t find me. I’m laughing at you Lilith. You’re absolutely pathetic. I can’t believe I was ever so low to have a friend like you. You were nothing but a waste of my time.”

“You’re always thinking, aren’t you?! Guess I’m going to have to be a little more creative now that you’ve got that fucking dog! Maybe you’ll get to watch “Charlie” die all over again. What do you...”

“I’m never talking to you again, Lilith. I hope you’re watching this.”

I closed the call and I dropped the phone on the concrete walkway. I brought my father’s thermos down on it over and over again until my phone was in pieces.

I finally felt like I had some control. For the first time I had hope that I could figure a way out of everything. A way out of her.

For some reason, I got up and walked over to Pete’s car. He looked like hell, and it was obvious that he never expected me to walk over to him because he was fidgeting like a cornered animal in the front seat. He rolled down his window. Charlie stood up and put his front paws on the door and sniffed at Pete.

“You doin’ alright, Mam?”

“For now, yeah.”

“Was that her on the phone?”

“Oh come on Pete. I’m the suspect now, aren’t I? Lilith’s just a myth. You don’t believe me, do you?”

“Yes, I do.”

There was a pause, but there was no awkwardness. It felt good to have someone say that they believed me, although I had no idea why he did.

“Looks like you’ve warmed up to Charlie.”

“How old are you Pete? You look like you’re twelve.”

“I’m twenty three, Mam.”

“Well I’m sure you’ve got better things to do than sit here when you’re off duty. What are you doing here?”

“It’s my job.”

“Not right now it’s not. Why are you always here?” 

“I just want to make sure you’re ok.”

“That’s it, huh? Why did you say that?”

“What?”

“Why did you say you believed me?”

Another pause. He looked straight ahead and bit his lip.

“Uh… I just feel like I should be here.”

“Why do you believe me?”

He seemed to be searching for an excuse, but he must have come up short. He sighed.

“The reason I decided to become a cop was because of my mom. My dad, he… he’s a really bad guy. He hurt her a lot. When I was eight, she took me and ran. He followed us everywhere. Wouldn’t accept the fact that she didn’t want him. 

Had family and friends keep tellin’ her that she was makin’ somethin’ outta nothin’. Tellin’ her she needed to go back. That it was all her fault. My mom got so tired, she eventually gave in and went back to him. He knocked her head against the stove just a couple of months later. He’s sittin’ in prison now, and my mom’s buried out in Seguin.”

“I’m sorry.”

“I guess when someone takes a piece of you like that, you can just see it in other people when they’ve got a missin’ piece too. Everything happenin’ to you, none of it makes sense, but I can see it on your face that you’re tellin’ the truth.”

“Thank you.”

“That’s why I stay out here. Eventually, she’s gonna show back up. We’ll get her.”

“Pete? Make sure your doors are locked and your windows are rolled up. Don’t open up for anybody. I’ll see you in the morning.”

\-

I was in the garage, standing next to my dad’s workbench. The necklace that Lilith had given me all those years ago was in front of me. I had fished it out of the garbage can after thinking about what Pete said. 

*“I guess when someone takes a piece of you like that, you can just see it in other people when they’ve got a missing piece too.”*

I stared at the small point where the two streaks came together. I wanted to sever it.

There was a small gold cap at the top of the stone where the chain was affixed. I took a couple of tools and worked at the top. Eventually, I felt something snap, and that little gold cap unscrewed. A small part of the stone had been hollowed out. Something was moving inside of it.

I poured the rest of the coffee out of the thermos, and I shook the stone over it.

A small drop fell out of the stone and plopped at the bottom of the thermos. It was moving around. I remembered what Lilith had said.

*“There’s something special inside of it.”*

*“What?”*

*“A little bit of me.”*

Lilith wasn’t just a monster, she was more of a disease. One that I had unknowingly carried for almost twenty years.

A disease that had infected everything in my life down to my soul.

I didn’t know it exactly at the time, but I do now.

I was so fucking scared.

I’m still fucking scared.

\-

The Christmas lights. 

Those damned white Christmas lights that we had strung over thumb tacks all throughout our apartment. We loved the way it lit up our walls. Walls that had been touched up over the years with sheens that didn’t quite match the old paint. The lights made those spots shine more than the rest.

The stained carpet was thin, and you could feel the coldness of the cement coming up through it.

Lilith was constantly spraying Febreze because the smell of our neighbors smoking pot would pour through the vents and it drove her nuts.

We had a small tree that year. Most of the decorations on it were made out of construction paper and glue. We also got a box of multi-colored candy canes that we hung from the branches that we would eat as the month wore on.

I refused to let Lilith contribute more than me, so we lived on the cheap. Half and half. 

We loved it that way.

Just the two of us.

It was our second Christmas Eve together. I didn’t go home to see my parents that year. 

We had Bridget Jones on the television, our flannel pajamas on, and we were getting drunk and eating nachos. It was perfect.

She insisted that we open our presents that night. She didn’t want to wait until morning. I didn’t have a lot of money that year. I got her a copy of “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” on DVD, and I made her a frame out of a bunch of mismatched puzzle pieces. On the bottom, I was able to piece together the word “Soulmates”. The picture I put inside was her favorite picture of us.

She loved it. She put it up on the mantle. As far as I know, it’s still sitting there.

She handed me her gift.

“Oh come on!”

“No, seriously, open it.”

“It’s a jewelry box, Lilith!”

“So what?”

“We had a twenty dollar limit! You promised.”

“Well it hardly seems fair that I have to buy you a shitty present just because your’e poor as fuck! Quit being a bitch and be grateful that you have an amazing friend.”

“Whatever.”

“Are you going to open it, or are you just going to stare at it?”

I tore the paper off. The box inside wasn’t like anything I had ever seen in a store. It looked like it was made out of a translucent jade, but the closer I looked at it, I could see that it was made from layers and layers of paper that had been treated with something that gave it its color and made it hard. 

“What is this?”

“Just a box.” She smiled. 

“It’s gorgeous.”

“It’s something I learned how to do a long time ago. I haven’t made one since I was a kid. I’m glad you like it… but… you know, it is just a box. There’s more inside.”

I felt like I was opening some kind of ancient treasure. I pulled the top off and inside was a necklace.

The chain was a white gold and at the end of it was a small stone.

“Oh my God.”

“Do you like it?”

“Lilith, it’s… I mean…” I was dumbstruck. It was a perfect tear drop of Obsidian. I held it up in the white light. The black stone had two streaks running around it that were clearer than the rest. The streaks touched each other at only a tiny point on the front of the stone. Other than that point, there was the tiniest line of black that separated them around the stone.  “You definitely… I… I feel like…”

“Ok, so this is gonna sound a little sappy, but I already committed to it and I’m drunk, so I have to own it. The two streaks are you and me. We’re surrounded by nothing but darkness. That darkness can come between us, but there is always this one point. The one spot where the darkness will never be able to separate us.”

I put my arms around her. I didn’t want to let go. She finally pushed me away. I just stared at her. I wondered what I did to deserve someone like her. I couldn’t say anything. 

It got awkward.

Lilith always had a problem with an awkward silence. She finally broke the moment in the same way she always did when she started to feel uncomfortable; by being crass.

“Oh for heaven’s sake! I can’t tell if you’re looking at me like I’m your mother or you want to fuck me. Either way, you're never getting your mouth on my boobs! Turn around!”

She snatched the stone out of the box and I pulled my hair up. The teardrop rested at the top of my breastbone. It felt warm against my skin, and I said as much.

“That’s because there’s something special inside of it.”

“What?”

“A little bit of me.” I had no idea what she meant. I got up and walked to the small mirror we had on the wall next to the front door. I couldn’t stop touching it. 

“I feel like such an asshole.” I looked at her behind me in the reflection.

“Why?”

“Because you got me this and I got you Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt.”

It was the best Christmas I ever had.

\-

There were Christmas lights on almost every house that I ran by. I had called 911 as I was running. Several people rolled by with their windows down and asked me if I needed a ride. I didn’t answer any of them. I wasn’t in my right mind. I kept thinking that any one of them could be her.

The bar was probably just over a mile from my parent’s house. 

At one point, there was a dog sitting in the shadows on the sidewalk across the street. It watched me as I ran by.

It looked like a dog I hadn’t seen since I was a little girl.

It whined. I tried not to give it a second thought until I heard it running behind me. I worried that whatever Lilith put into my body to paralyze me was also making me hallucinate. It followed me all the way through my old neighborhood.

I was almost to my street when my dad called me.

“Amy?”

“Dad! Are you and mom ok?!”

“Yeah.”

“Where’s Jessica?!”

“She’s right here. Baby, what’s wrong? The police are here.”

I rounded the corner and could see flashing lights in front of my parent’s house.

\-

Nothing was out of the ordinary. Not a damn thing.

It had to have been Lilith on the phone. She had used my daughter’s voice.

I wouldn’t let go of Jessica. She begged me to let her go back to bed while the cops were talking to me, and my mother finally had to pry her out of my arms.

I told them everything. 

I told them about the dead man back at the bar. 

They took me in for questioning. They promised me that they would leave someone to watch over my family.

\-

I was questioned for hours. The same story, over and over again. 

The lead detective was a small guy; rail thin and a large nose. Detective Hopkins was middle aged and his hairline was starting to raise the white flag. 

His suit was crumpled and there was a small coffee stain on his shirt just to the right of his tie. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it while I answered his questions. He started to notice and every once in a while he would reach down and try to cover it up by moving his tie over it. He looked at me like I was nuts. I told him to call the cops back in Louisville, and they would corroborate everything I was saying about Lilith.

Everything about that video.

I asked him if anyone had a few cigarettes that they could spare.

I quit smoking years ago. Lilith hated it. While I was sitting in the interrogation room, lighting one after the other, I wasn’t sure if I was doing it because it was something I used to run to in times of stress, or to somehow spite Lilith in any way I could. Whatever the reason was, it felt good. It gave me something to do besides just stare at the floor.

\-

The door opened and Detective Hopkins walked back in. He had changed his shirt.

“Mrs. Taylor? I have a little bit of news.” He sat down. He had two cups of coffee. He pushed one of them toward me. “Why didn’t you go back to Louisville?”

“I don’t know. I don’t know anything right now, I’m going to be honest.”

“Ok. Um… here’s the deal. This is all very strange.” He took a drink of his coffee. “Your husband is still alive.”

“What? No. He’s not.”

“We have him using his credit card four different times in the last two days. In two of those places, we have him on video.”

“That’s Lilith!”

An awkward pause.

“Whoever it is, they’re obviously following you. Now, no one can explain the video that was found in your home, but it’s kind of hard to deny that your husband is alive. There’s also no trace of this woman, Lilith.”

“Are you fucking kidding me?!”

“Please stay with me, ok? I’m on your side. What I’m saying is, that there is no record of her name anywhere. Obviously she’s been using an alias. If she’s following you as well, there’s just no trace of her.”

“But I showed you the texts!”

“We’re still trying to figure out who that phone belongs to.” 

“No one even saw her at the bar?!”

“No.” 

“I don’t believe this.”

“That wound on your hand. Are you sure the man at the bar didn’t do that to you?” He was concerned. He obviously thought I was disturbed, but the kindness in his voice was there. He was trying to understand.

“I’m positive.”

“We got the video from the motel. It’s clear that man was about to attack you. I got a name on him too. He has a very long history of violence Mrs. Taylor. Most of it towards women. You’re a very lucky woman.”

“Well I’m not feeling so lucky.”

“The reason I asked you is because he has the same type of burn on his arm.”

“I told you how that happened.”

“I know you did. We got a sample of your blood and we’re checking out his while we speak. If you were drugged, we’re gonna know. I’m on your side, uh, can I call you Amy?”

“Yeah.” 

“I’m on your side, Amy. I’m just trying to make sense out of all this. ”

“There isn’t any sense to it.”

“I’m going to give you my card. I’ll be in touch, but if you need anything, you call me. I’m going to have one of my officers give you a ride to your parents house. I’m taking this very seriously. There’s going to be someone watching that house all day and all night. We’re going to figure this out. I promise.”

I was about to lose it. I started shaking. I was holding back tears. He reached forward and put his hand on my shoulder. His eyes were blue. They were kind.

Another awkward pause.

“Do you even believe me?”

“I know you believe it. For right now, that’s enough for me.”

I looked back down at his shirt. He had another small drop of coffee in the same place as before. He followed my eyes and then shook his head.

“I think I’ve got a hole in my lip.”

\-

It was after three in the afternoon when I was finally able to go back home. Two plain clothes cops drove me. I sat in the backseat staring through the window at the town where I grew up. Everything looked different to me, even though everything was the same. There was no comfort being in my old home because there was something out there lurking within it. Something alien and cruel.

The cop who was driving the car kept looking back at me in the rearview. I didn’t like the way he was looking at me, almost leering. I looked at him in the rearview expecting him to keep his eyes forward, but he didn’t. He kept looking at me without saying a word.

When we pulled up to the house, there was a police cruiser sitting across the street. The cop inside was looking down; writing or playing with his phone.

He slowly looked up at me as we parked.

My phone vibrated.

It was a number I didn’t recognize, but when I opened it, the first words were, 

*“I had to get a new phone.”*

I turned off the screen and when I looked back up, the cop in the cruiser was smiling at me. I swore he even winked at me.

The cops said nothing to me as I got out of the car and walked toward the front door. 

My parents' neighbors, Homer and Joe, were sitting on their porch drinking their nightly cup of decaf. They had known me my whole life. Some of the best people I have been fortunate enough to know. They both waved at me; looks of concern were plastered over their wrinkled faces. As I opened the door and waved back at them, I had no way of knowing if one of them wasn’t who they were pretending to be.

Jessica ran over and I picked her up. I started telling her how much I missed her while I pulled the shade on my parents front window. The two cops in the driveway and the cop in the cruiser were all looking at me.

My parents were both standing in the family room. They weren’t saying anything.

“Angel, I need to put you down for a minute, ok?”

“But I missed you.”

“I know baby, just give Mommy a minute. Why don’t you go climb on Poppy, ok?”

I checked all of the locks on the doors and windows, and I made sure all the blinds were closed.

My parents watched me run through their house like a crazy person until I finally made it to the sliding glass window that opened into the backyard. There was a sorry sight looking back at me; a bony old German Shepherd whose tail was moving just as wildly as I was. His tongue was hanging out of the side of his mouth and his ratty coat was covered in dust. He looked like something from my past and I thought I had imagined him the night before.

He started whining at me.

“What the hell is that?”

“It’s a dog.”

“I know it’s a dog Dad, what is it doing in your backyard?”

“He followed you home. Real nice old guy. Doesn’t he look familiar?”

“Dad. I can’t do this right now.” I pulled the shade down on the slider. I stared at the three of them. That’s when the gravity of everything came crashing down. I started blubbering in front of my daughter, or who I thought was my daughter.

“Mommy, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing baby.” I wiped my nose and tried to compose myself. I threw my hands in the air and smiled back at her. “Angel, what music did Mommy play you over and over on the ride down here? If you get it right, I’ll make you waffles!”

“Princess and Frog!” 

“Yay! You got it right!” I put my hands out to her and picked her up. I looked at my parents. I remember praying to God they were both actually my parents.

“Dad… what was the safeword I gave you?”

“Truck. What’s going on?”

“Mom… what was yours?” My mom’s eyes went to the ceiling.

“Oh honey… I can’t remember.Um…”

I swallowed hard.

“Mom! What was the fucking word?!”

“Amy!” 

“Hey! Don’t speak to your mother like that! Or in front of our granddaughter like that!” 

“Mom, please… what was it?” I was pleading.

She was taking too long. I was terrified that Lilith had done something to my mother and it was Lilith I was staring at. I put Jessica down and behind me.

“Oh! Frito Pie! It was Frito Pie.”

I sank to the floor sobbing. 

My parents and my daughter were there with me.

She hadn’t hurt them or taken them.

At the very least I knew that. I finally broke down.

\-

Later that night, I was sitting in the recliner in front of my Dad’s ridiculously large tv. All the lights were off. I had done the monster check under Jessica’s bed for her before she laid down. After I put her to sleep, I did the monster check for myself through the rest of the house.

My Dad was out in the backyard giving that old dog a can of Vienna Sausages before he went to bed. He was always a sucker for stray dogs, and since this one looked like our old dog Charlie, my Dad fell for it hook, line, and sinker. When he came inside, he knelt down and petted my head.

“It’s gonna be ok, baby. The sun’s gonna come up tomorrow. You just try and get some sleep.”

“I love you Daddy.”

He kissed my forehead and walked down the hall.

\-

It was impossible to sleep. I walked to the sliding glass door and cracked it and had a cigarette. The dog just sat there.

“What are you looking at?” 

The dog cocked his head and let out a low, grumbling answer.

“Looks like you got a new home.” 

Another jowl flapping response.

“You really look like Charlie. That’s crazy.”

No answer back.

“Are you Charlie?”

I knelt down and put out my hand to pat his head, but then I drew it back. Something wasn’t right. I threw the cigarette outside and closed the door. The dog cocked his head and whined. I pulled the shade over the door and checked the lock.

I remembered the text message that I didn’t finish and reached into my pocket.

*“I had to get a new phone. I’m glad you’re back home. You’ll never guess who I am now. They were delicious. Better than Frito Pie ;) You’ve only got two days to figure it out, then we’re going to play a new game.”*

\-

I paced the house for hours. I tried to be as quiet as I could, but the dog must have heard me. He was always waiting for me, pawing at the back door whenever I was walking back through the living room.

\-

At one point, I stood in the doorway to my bedroom. I was staring at a life before I even met Lilith. Everything was exactly as it had been when I moved out. My eyes moved over everything, and they settled on my bookshelf.

I started to shake.

The last time I had seen the necklace Lilith had given me was in my jewelry box back in Louisville, but now it was draped over the puzzle piece frame. The picture inside was the same, but my face had been scratched out. 

Lilith had been in my parents’ house. 

I wondered if she still was.

It has it moments where the medication really helps (Omeprazole) and sometimes it doesn’t. Fast forward to this year (2024) and I was diagnosed with Walking Pneumonia at the end of October. They did put me on Prednisone to help with my chest which landed me in the ER because on of the major side effects is digestion issues. It didn’t mix well with my GERD. However, since having Pneumonia it seems my GERD is more sensitive. I have almost cut out all caffeine, coffee or soda since my ER visit which was my biggest trigger but it doesn’t seem to be helping. Has anyone else experience this after being sick ? Will it mellow out eventually or am I looking at adjusting my meds ? I’m at 2 pills a day. ",1,1734831600.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

Hi all, I’ve been troubleshooting my HomeKit setup for weeks. It worked almost flawlessly for 6 months, but now I’m getting errors like “That device isn’t responding” when asking Siri to perform actions. I suspect the hub (Apple TV 4K 2nd gen) might be the issue, but I’m seeing some confusing symptoms:
	•	Apple TV works perfectly for streaming but shows “No Response” for all devices in the Home app (except cameras) across all devices (iPads, iPhones).
	•	Apple TV remote on my phone and my wife’s phone barely connects—randomly allowing typing in the search bar but failing to fully function as a remote.
	•	HomePods can control devices intermittently (about 50% success rate).


Fixes I’ve tried:
	•	Rebooting all devices, plugs, and switches.
	•	Ensuring all software is updated.
	•	Rebooting the network and mesh hubs (no issues detected in diagnostics).

Any ideas on what’s going wrong or next steps to fix this? Is the hub dead? Thanks!",3,1734831427.0,HomeKit,6,0.8,False

'Hello my name is John St James. I was a human being living on Earth in North America in the late 20th century. One day a giant hand appeared from the sky and … well there is no other way to put it . The giant hand shot putted me to a different world.”

“I got to tell you it felt like I got hit by a truck...”

~~~

I go by Kar the merchant now.

The cart wheel hit a rut, the jar from it went from my tail bone to the hair on the top of my head. A low moan escaped from my lips. “Mother-f” I said out loud but stopped and looked around. “Got-ta stop using Earth cursing. It almost got me shunned by the priesthood.” *


I hurt all over, even my hair. GODs! What a hangover. I had finely found a niche as a traveling merchant. I had shied away from the Wizard Warrior thing. Being flung here by a cosmic whatever from Earth had placed me in to a semi dark ages world where magic was real. It also had a gravity of just slightly above ½ of Earths norm, kind of [John Carter] of Mars strength wise for me. It took a full year out in the wilds to learn how to walk with out arousing suspicion by taking 20-30 foot steps or jumping up ten feet as I walked as well as not to break things with my hands. I was also able to take care of my self. I stalked through the wild, learning what and where I could. I was able to learn common tongue from this worlds version of a druid. His name was Quëa.


More tree then human but a nice guy none the less. (Later on after I had learned Elvish it dawned on me that his name meant “Turnip vegetable.”) I learned what plants were useful and how to make poultices, potions and poisons. He gave me some magic beans that allowed me to learn to speak and read different languages. (Magic beans – I know. Right?!) I explored [Plundered] a wizard tower or three. I gathered a few spells, magical weapons and alchemy equipment and (F-ing A) Make that ah – Huzzah! A bag of holding!

So then with my average Army hand to hand, kendo techniques I had learned **  and some -  “SCA”***  skills that I had that were now in the bad ass range because of my new found strength and speed. Basic chemistry and science skills allowed me to pick up alchemy and magic pretty fast.


(*) I was once over heard cursing a singular god and was accused of being an apostate for not referencing the Pantheon of deities. After I straightened that out they of course fined me for cursing...


(**) Kendo - The Korean guy who taught me Kendo used to beat the hell out of me because he said I was a Qualla bear So slow but it was OK.  As long as I fought other westerners I would hold my own but if I came up against an a Asian that I should run ... 


(***) SCA- Society for Creative Anachronism.


Instant Wizard, Warrior, Hero, Villain, Monster. Was I Good, Was I Evil, Was I Lawful, Was I Neutral.
Was I lame, was I a loser!?!?!

 ~~~ 

I started out to try the adventurer rout but learned quickly to keep a lower profile. Yeah you can beat the evil Earl, the evil Earls knights, all the evil Earls retainers. Then what? Odds are you could take over that fiefdom and or fight more soldiers, knights, retainers and if you win, you end up taking responsibility for everyone and every thing. Or knock it all down and walk away and leave nothing but chaos behind you. Mother-fu – Fornicate your sire! 


(Hmmmm -I may keep that one.)


I was lucky enough (Or read that as paranoid enough.) to realize that as a new unknown growing power I would be seen as a threat to the established order and something to fear, something to control or something to destroy.

Things like biting a soldiers sword in half with my bare teeth or back handing a Mountain Troll in to a cliff rock wall and leaving a troll sized outline when it fell forward. Cartoonish, I know.

Knowing what gases are flammable and what plasma was as well as force projection makes a hell of a plasma lance and is also in hindsight quite memorable. That got me all kinds of unwanted attention. 

No less then three groups of knights, two religious orders and a college of wizards showed up looking for me and those were the supposed good or lawful ones I shutter to think of the evil ones. I had to do something and do it quick.

Then I remembered something from my D&D DM days* – how when given great power most people / players didn't think about responsibility SO in a dungeon where the biggest room was 25 meters I would hand out magic wands of Fireballs and Lighting bolts as treasure that had ranges of up to 100 meters unless other wise stated. Can you say back wash? But, but, but, but - motor boat sounds.......


Show me on your character sheet that you limited your attacks to 25 meters or less ….


So the hero John St James had a fiery heroic end leaving no trace as with most of those new to large amounts of magical power in a quizzy magical self made witness protection event. I ARR I ARG It's not a TOOOMOR and I erased YOU! YOU WONT BE BACK! ARR ARG!


So now I was on the right track. No fuss no muss. Meek little me. Okey Dokey!


Yup, I was real smart. Things were working out quite well. I was thinking of finding a medium sized town off the beaten track and opening a store or an Inn. Then living the quiet life. Going out once or twice a year to gather new wears to sell as well as to manufacture by magic a few things out of sight of prying eyes. Yes I would hire some buxom tavern wenches and ... Well that had been the plan.

Then last night I got tired of the small beer, beer and ale, ciders. The wine in this village was little better then vinegar. I had been able to learn how to filter and sterilize water with out calling attention to my self but I didn't want water or tea. Gods of  this world be merciful! Please let me find COFFEE in this world and CHOCOLATE. My stomach growled and a foul tasting burp made its way to my throat. I washed out my mouth with water and spit it out. 


The night before last I was getting bored and being a little drunk I had a bright idea.


I decided to try a little pocket magical moon-shining. Well it worked like the charm it was (Pardon the pun.) and I got drunk off my ass. Magical Ever-clear 190 Prof + M. *  I got blackout drunk and using a Adventurer tag I had forgotten I had. Not being one to waste things. I for some unknown reason took on a quest to defeat a dragon.


So here I am driving this God ... Gods dammed cart off to find a Dragon and defeat it.


I could have still got out of it. Everyone saw I was drunk as a lord so it would have been embarrassing but doable but in my zeal [drunken stupidity] I took 1/2 of the quest money up front for “supplies” and bought beer and ale for the inn for the entire night. I did not have enough gold or wares to pay back the advance.


So here I am – The cart wheel hit a rut again I almost fell off the cart as I leaned over to throw-up trying not to throw-up on Bob. (Yeah I know Bob is kind of a lame name for a horse, he chose it.) I felt like I was going to die but to no small surprise on my part. I lived. An hour or two before sun down I drove the cart to a likely looking camp site and setup camp after I wiped down and curried Bob. I cleaned his hooves and his tack. 


Bob looked at me with those neutral horse eyes. (I said I was sorry you should have tried better to miss the ruts in the road.) I gave him some grain and let him graze. “What? Are we out of apples already?” Bob said. (Oh yeah I forgot to say that I gave Bob one of the Magical beans Turnip gave me by accident and now Bob can talk.)


“KAR wake up, please wake up” “Snort slurp” The camp fire had burn nearly out, it was near or past midnight.


“Yuck, Bob why did you drool on me? What is it?” I said. “There's something out in the woods.” Bob said. “How many times do I have to tell you the wards”  ... I said and stopped.” OH Sh...”  I had forgotten to set the camp wards to alert us and keep things out. There wasn't a single bird or insect sound around the camp. The stars were lost in blackness.


I rolled to my feet and reached in to my bag of holding and pulled out my magic staff. I lit it up with flames and kicked more wood on the fire. Can you see or hear them Bob. I asked. They're all around us whispered Bob. Dam I thought, I can't see anything even with my staff lit up and the camp fire was now blazing.


(* ) 190 Prof + M. Yeah, that's right - follow the cute little invisible animals around and talk to trees. Tho in this land sometimes the trees answer back and the little, cute little invisible animals are carnivores with large sharp teeth...


~~~


The dark out side of the circle of fire light was like a blank black void ...  do I pull my sword, maybe my crossbow ... What to do?!?!?!?


What ever they are they are moving and I can sense it, feel it. I could try a fire ball or a fire lance and start a forest fire. The darkness was pressing in, seemly drawing the breath from my lungs...it's getting thicker ... I need to push it back to – [to attack the dark.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_aJgcVv62Y) I started to giggle, Bob whinnied the horse equivalent of “WTF!”* ... 


Close your eyes and put your head behind my back Bob. I shouted.


I invoked my celestial light spell with the alchemy rune for mercury and added wind and pressure. 


Instant mercury vapor light! I pushed the spells 10 times and the world exploded in to whiteness. Even with my eyes closed and my hands press over them I was blinded for a time.


I heard howls and screams of rage and pain and then nothing. My spells faded away, slowly I could hear the natural sounds of the forest come back. Later I was able to check around our camp and I found nothing. No tracks, no tore up ground; nothing. In the morning after both of us stayed awake for the rest of the night I checked the area again and found nothing. There were some ruins a mile or two a way on a small hill but nothing else. I even cast identify and wizard sight on the ruin for a distance and got nothing ... There had been an oppressive vale over the area before but now nothing.


So another in a long line of unknown WTF's ah WITPOTGs** happened! Naa that doesn't work “What in the Fornication!”  No it's just not the same.  This world drives me crazy some times


“Why are you so morose Kar” Bob asked.


“Hummm, hey Bob?” I said “Do you know any good Horse curse words?”… 


Note from the higher concurrences.


(And so my young-lings it was on this day one hundred years ago the the great darkness that ravaged our land was rend and ripped away by the Great Wizard and his magical steed Bob – and the light of Truth…) Wow even in my own narrative Bob the horse gets top billing, thank the gods I don't have a cat ….  ... .. .^^


~~~


Hey it passed the time ...  ... 

Much later … Are there any apples left asked Bob? Oh for the nine or tenth time NO! I said you ate them all .. You had some too! Bob countered … I had four and you ate the rest of the basket by your self … We would get to a village before sun set. It was a good thing to as I was wondering how to make a gun to shoot Bob after I broke his legs ...  No I wouldn't shoot Bob… I'll invent peanut butter ...  Yeah that should keep his mouth busy so he will shut up … works with dogs  ... 



(*)“WTF!*” What the fornication!?!



(**)WITPOTG! What In The Pantheon Of The Gods!



~~~



We passed through the last two villages a week ago. Bob sweet tooth, tooth's ... were sated via three baskets of apples, pairs and carrots. We met no one of note as we passed through the villages. Every one was going south as we went north. Bob and I kept moving further in to the wilds. I felt a little better about the quest and my ability to possibly complete it. 



I, we …  had not been able to gather any more information on the Dragon then what we had … Bob had come up dry as well, asking questions of other residents in the stables by the inns we stayed in. Bob checked and none of the professional Horses or Oxen C.W.L. '309'* that lived and mooooved in the area had any further thoughts to add to our small amount of facts about the dragon… 



Was the Dragon young, was the Dragon small, was the Dragon big, was the Dragon red, was the Dragon black …  Did it fall from the sky, had it sprung from the earth. … The lack of facts and the wealth of useless information and bovine excrement was not helpful tho the guild had thought enough of the reported sighting to place a bounty and quest on it … Even if it was a case of someone heard someone say Dragon and then ran till they got to a guild office 'weeeee weeeee weeeee' and set the quest. (and then went 'weeeee weeeee weeeee' all the way back home) 



No straw, no sticks and no bricks...no pool, no pets ain't got no cigarettes ...No substantial information.



We had its general location … about a weeks travel will bring us in to it's domain. I had detoured a bit to get up high on a hill and climbed the tallest tree there … I was able to make out a smudge of black smoke where there should be none straight on our current track. We got close. About three four miles. I found a draw a large rut really (two parallel ridges with a deep cut wide center) and a small over hang I parked the cart there. I set the camp wards and I took an extra leather belt and attached it to Bob's blanket and put the same runes on it that I used for the camp and added some to obscure him from sight. “That should keep you warm and safe.” I said. Bob walked over to the basket of carrots and munched one … 'wabrt crunch' Snort slerp'  ...  “who's going to keep you safe?” He said under his breath.



“Yo Bob, pay attention.” I said. “I laid out your grain and fruit, there's lots of grass in this area and there's a small stream about 50 steps to the south. Don't pig out and I will be back in a day or two. You stay here but if things go bad for me you run or hide or do both” … 



Bob just nodded his head and looked at me with those neutral horse eyes. I headed out to scout the Dragon. A minute or two later.




(*) Cartage workers local 309.



~~~


Softly so only he could hear it Bob prayed.

All father. Great stallion. Make him fast and fleet of hoof, let him be accurate, let his blade strike true. 

Make his arm swifter than any who would seek to destroy him. 

Grant him victory over his foes. And do not let death know his name, 

Let not his last thought be ""if I had only."" But rather, 

Let the halls of Valhalla and the endless meadows ring with his name. 

And let him die not but stand atop a mountain of enemy corpses.

SKAL!

“Don't die. Snort slerp” Bob prayed.

Bob the horse was orthodox Viking, who knew?



~~~



She roared in anger, in pain, she wailed in sorrow and humiliation … “Will death not come?” She asked her self. “Will no one come?” “IS THERE NO ONE!” “To end this?” Hunger gnawed at her stomach … She hadn't eaten anything for three moons.* since the shell of rock that had covered her cracked. Waking her and exposing her to the elements for the first time in an millennium**. She slipped in to a fevered dream hoping for release ... 



I moved as quietly as I could taking care to observe as much as I could see. It was a juvenile sized dragon about the size of a large wagon pulled by two large draft horses, may be 35 - 40 feet nose to tail end. Blue in color. I got close enough to hear the dragon mumbling under its breath which may have sounded very quite to her, 'HER” it sounded like a her (a female) but to the rest of the world it was like a child shouting.



“I want my toys. I want to fly to Naedon's domain and play, I want my dinner, I'm so bored, I'm so tired, I'm so hungry.” the dragon said.



I felt that there was magic in the area, spells, wards, a curse; powerful ones on or in the location of the dragon. The dragon seem to be sticking out of a smallish rock mound. There was literally a pressed image of it in the rock behind it. I took a chance and casted identify and wizard sight and there was no back lash and I got a large amount of info back.



(*) Dragons could go many months, evens 100's of years with out sustenance and live. Tho it was hard way to die.



(**) 1,000 years


~~~


The rock mound was 1000 years old built up over time and there was a containment spell or a limiting spell on the dragon and one or two others layered on it that I could not discern what they were for. 



I sensed no malice or malicious intent on the contrary there were what seemed to be threads of protection woven in to the spells and I looked them over more thoroughly. The more I looked at the spells the less sense they made. They had no back lash, no trigger to launch another spell tho I did see one that was a notification spell. It was like a huge multi-layered door way but with nothing behind it. It was a door way, it had a pass phrase, a key ….It was a little past midday and I was still puzzling out what the spells were for. The dragon started to repeat it's litany of complaints and wants. 



“I'm cold, I want a hot drink, I want my toys. I want to go play, I want something to eat, I'm so bored, I'm so tired, I'm so hungry, I'm never going to apologize, never!” she said over and over.........




OMG's! *




It came to me in a blaze of light. IT WAS A TIME OUT! The dragon was in a time out. I could leave and let the guild know that the dragon was stuck where it was. Tho they would more then likely send out a termination squad. Dragon parts were very valuable and a restrained dragon even with the small amount of protection woven in to the main spell would be a easy kill. Hell I could take it out with a thought. A lot of money there, enough to set me up for two or three life times enough to buy a town or a town and noble patent – title. I could be a Count, a Lord...



Yeah RIGHT!



No. I could be an a-hole but not 100 percent an Ahole , ah a dick...


Oh well I said to my self and started walking towards the dragon.


“Heeellllooooooo!! “I yelled and waved.


“Hello there! Dragon, Blue Dragon?” I yelled again.


“Hello there Miss/Ms Blue Dragon.” I shouted.


The dragon sat up startled and it looked like she bumped her head hard on the over head barrier and let of a loud squealing “OUCH!”


The dragon crouched down and pulled its wings in front of it like a wrap and dipped her head behind them.



(* ) OMG's! Oh My Gods!


~~~


“NO! NO! You go away, you leave me alone! I will blast you! I will!' The dragon said shrilly.


A bolt of lightning shot from her mouth and was absorbed mostly by the barrier with bit of blow back right in to her muzzle. She gave a startled squeak and started to cry. A small patch of grass nearby soldered..



There is nothing in this world or the next that compares to a child crying, a female child crying, a Female Juvenile Sized Blue Dragon CRYING!



“NOW, NOW It's OK.” I said. “YOU'RE gonna be fine. You said you are hungry and thirsty?? Her head came up and the crying dropped of to just sniffles. 'You have something to eat? she asked. Peeking over her wings.



I said “Lets see if we can get some thing past the barrier first.” I took out a smoked ham from my bag of holding and tossed at the barrier it passed through and she caught it and gulped it down and said 'MORE!”



“What's the magic word?” I said. A look of total confusion over came her face. Her lower lip stated to quiver and project out. 



I quickly said “The magic word is Please.” “OH My Yes YES Please more meat please.” The dragon repeated. 



I took out a half hunch of beef and tossed it to her and then I got out a barrel and brewed tea in it with a bucket of honey. Another round of meat and tea then a half a dozen pies and the Blue Dragon gave out a small sigh of contentment.



The Blue Dragon had sated her hunger for now and while looking at her claws asked coyly “Can you free me?” She said now looking side ways at me.



“Oh yes I can but I wont, that's up to you.” I said. Her lower lip stated to quiver and project out as before but with a bit of calculated effort. “I'm never going to apologize, never!” She said



“Well that's up to you .”I said. “I was sent out here by the Adventures guild to check on a dragon.” “The adventures guild ….. what do they want?” ...she said. “Well you have been out of the rock mound for a while and more then a few people, travelers have made reports. I said   “I want to go home.”...she squeaked.



I could feel a powerful presence near but unseen. 



“I would think that from what I can see in these spells you should know how to free your self.” I said.



“I don't wanna I don't wanna. I 'm never going to apologize, never! “She said. “Then I 'm sorry its getting late and I need to get back to my horse, feed him and have my own dinner.” I said.



“You have a good evening.” I said and turned to walk away. “PLEASE!” And much softer she said “I'm sorry, please I'm so sorry.” And then very faint and far away I think heard “thank you.”
The spell flashed and unrolled massive threads of light then broke in to millions of motes of light and faded away.



A massive shadow moved over me and the blue dragon was gone. I felt like I was under a heavy gaze not oppressive but firm. Like a mountain.



Without turning to look I said. “Small children do not always do as they are told”...I heard and felt a low rolling rumble of laughter. I then heard. “The line of man has improved some what.” And then the presence was gone.



I breathed out several deep breaths of relief and then It dawned on me. Now how in the world was I going to convince the guild I defeated a dragon. I looked around and on the ground and I saw few small Blue Dragon scales, rare Cristal dragon tears and a smallish scroll....



I picked them up and made my way back to camp just as the last light of the day failed. I added wood to the fire I made a large meal for both of us and I even got Bob a little drunk.


Is this the end of the story? How much will Kar get from the guild for this? The scales and the tears, how much are they worth and what in the wide wide world of isekai is on that scroll. Will Kar lose his plain old merchant life style?”",4,1734831387.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

","I just returned from my first visit to Epic headquarters and wanted to share a few tips with anyone else that might be going to Epic for the first time. 


1. First of all, be prepared to be amazed! 
2. 👖 Dress code. There is no need to dress up. You’ll see everyone dressed pretty casually. 
3. 🚘 Getting to Epic.Despite the many buildings and massive grounds, Epic has one address. If you are going for training, ask your driver to take you to VOYAGER HALL. This is where the training center is. 🦕
5. 🧳 Coming straight from the airport or leaving to? A large self served luggage storage area is available at Voyager Hall. They even have a scale! 
6. 🥘 Yes, the food is as amazing as you’ve heard! Voyager Hall offers delicious breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snacks for trainees. Put a pause on your low carb diet and don’t skip the bread! 🥖 Everyday was different and tasted so fresh and delicious. There are several beverage stations with coffee, tea, hot cocoa, etc so you’ll be well caffeinated to pay attention to your training. Did I mention this is all complementary?! Yes!! 🙌
7. 👕 Go shopping at the Epic store! I bought several Epic swag at reasonable prices. Check out their website prior, to start your shopping list. 
8. 🚎 Getting around Epic.
9. There are several complimentary shuttle services available at Epic to help you get from point A to B  … look for the cars painted like a cow. 🐄 I recommend stopping by the reception at Voyager Hall. Here you can find printed copies of all the areas and they can call a shuttle for you. 
10. 🎠Plan time to do a self tour. You will be blown away at the details of these buildings and artwork. It really is like a theme park but for offices! My personal favorite was Alice. Check out the rabbit hole! 🐰 
11. 🧑‍🌾Enjoy the hospitality of the people of WI. Every person we interacted with was so genuinely kind. 
12. 🏨 There are several great hotels options. I would recommend looking at which hotels offer shuttles to save a few dollars on transportation. You can find a list on the userweb. The hotel I stayed at was not in Verona but offered complimentary shuttle and hotel lounge access when booking it under Epic. Had I taken advantage of all the free food, I could have stayed in Madison and not spent any money on food! 
13. 🏛️Spend some time at the Capital. The capital offers many great eateries and is very walkable (unless it’s zero degrees!) You’ll see lots of young adults from University of Wisconsin - it feels like a college town.  Go to UW. Support the Badgers and pick up some Badgers gear. Campus is beautiful and there was a perfect area at UW Alumnai park to enjoy the view of the lake.  
14. ✈️ MSN airport is nice and modern. (I’m probably not your typical when I say I like airports. There is something about going to an airport that makes me feel nostalgic and peaceful). Lots of charging and seating options - they even have a room that you can attend a meeting from!
15. ❤️ Get reenergized and inspired. I love Epic! ",14,1734831288.0,epicsystems,3,0.82,False

I know my husband knows and my kids make jokes but they dont know how bad it is. I’m at the point where I absolutely can not keep doing this. I woke up with extreme anxiety. Put Kaluah in my coffee. I don’t even like it. Made my heart absolutely race and I was on the verge of a panic attack. So I dumped it out and went upstairs and did some yoga. Felt a little better. Got myself semi regulated by drinking a ton of water and ate. Went to my sister in laws (they’re big drinkers) and managed to not drink. But I’m terrified of Tuesday when we go there for Xmas dinner. When we left tonight they said “you better not be like this on Christmas Eve!!” Insinuating I “have” to drink. I might just pour myself one and not drink it, dump it out and pour another. We’ll see. I’m just not ready to admit any of this. But I can’t have another day like today again. I literally thought my heart was going to explode. 

My blood pressure is bad. I haven’t been to the PCP since 2019. I had never missed a yearly physical until 2020 due to Covid. And then 2021 they would not see me because I had a bad cold. 2022 my pcp retired and I never went and found another because I was burying my head in the sand. I finally made an appointment with a new pcp for first week of Feb. I’m going to try my damndest to not drink, eat better and exercise for January, and hopefully I’ll be on the road to recovery (pun intended) for my physical. I don’t even care if I have to go in BP meds. I just want to be better. 

Anyway, came home and had some tea and took some supplements (dandelion leaf, turmeric, beet root and milk thistle. They’re for blood pressure, liver health, and inflammation). Also drank 120 oz of water throughout the day, and ate fairly ok.

1hjo6vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hjo6vz/our_first_christmas/,Our First Christmas,"The tree casts a soft glow around the living room, bathing everything in warm, golden light. The smell of pine fills the air, mingling with the sweetness of hot cocoa. I can still feel the faint chill of the snowflakes that melted on my skin when we came in from our impromptu snowball fight. My cheeks are sore from smiling. I’m wearing an ugly knitted sweater covered in reindeers and I don’t care how cringe it makes me look.



This is what Christmas should feel like.



Our first Christmas as Mrs. and Mrs. Blake-Oldfield. God, even saying it out loud makes my chest swell. After years of dreaming, waiting, wishing, hoping and *praying* for a love like this, it’s finally here.



Lydia sits cross-legged on the floor before the tree, dark red hair pulled into a loose ponytail, her soft cheeks pink from the cold and laughter. She’s fussing with the ribbons on the gifts, biting her lip in concentration as she tucks and plucks, ravels and unravels, twiddles and fiddles. She always overthinks things like this; making everything ‘just right’. She thinks it’s because she’s a perfectionist. I know it’s because of the years she spent being told she wasn’t enough.



Too fat. Too plain. Too frumpy.



She’s none of those things to me. She’s Lydia. Beautiful, strong and, impossibly, mine. I’d say she’s as gorgeous as the day I first met her, but that would be a lie, because now her innate attractiveness is accentuated by happiness that shines from within.



“You’re overthinking it.” I set my mug of cocoa on the coffee table, get down off the couch and crawl to join her on the carpet.



“It has to be perfect.” She flashes me a sheepish grin. “It’s our *first Christmas.*”



I laugh. She’s so adorable. I lean in to place a kiss on her cheek. “It already is perfect, you goof.”



We’ve spent the whole evening in a blissful blur of traditions: decorating the tree, baking cookies (or attempting to, since I burned half of them) and dancing to Christmas music in the kitchen. When it got dark, we went outside and made snow angels in the yard, then threw snowballs like big kids, laughing until we couldn’t feel our fingers anymore.



And now here we are, placing presents under the tree, stealing kisses and whispering about how lucky we are.



But I haven’t told her yet.



Not about her gift.



The box nestles beneath the tree, wrapped in shiny gold paper and topped with a red bow. It’s the only gift about which I’m not nervous about; the one I know I got exactly right. Even the label turned out well. Usually, my handwriting is a sprawling mess but this one is neat as a pin: *To Lydia, you are my everything and you deserve the world, but until I can manage that I got you this, love from Claire.*



She follows my gaze to the gifts under the tree, green eyes soft. “You’re dying to know what I got you, aren’t you?”



I smirk. “Actually, I was thinking how nice it would be to kiss you on the mouth and not just the cheek.”



“Oh.” Her cheeks pinken further and I can’t help but laugh. “You’re incorrigible.”



“No, I’m in love.” I boop her nose. “With you, *Mrs Blake-Oldfield.*”



“Gosh, it still doesn’t feel real.”



“Oh, it’s real. You better believe it’s real. I’m real, you’re real, our marriage is real and this Christmas is real.” I glance at the gold-wrapped gift. “And your present is real.”



She sighs happily. “But … *do* you want to know what I got you?”



“Not nearly as much I bet you want to see what I got *you.*”



We burst into laughter, leaning against each other like schoolgirls sharing a secret. I don’t tell her that I already know. I know exactly what’s in the box with my name on it.



She’s thoughtful, my Lydia, but she’s terrible at keeping secrets. She tried – oh how she tried – but she couldn’t keep me in the dark. The late-night errands, the stains on her clothes that she thought I wouldn’t notice when I did the laundry, the way her hands and lips trembled when she kissed me goodnight. All were clues that led me to one conclusion.



I reach for one of those hands now, lacing my fingers with hers. She’s trembling again. I hope from anticipation.



“Lydia,” I say gently. “I know it’s Christmas Eve and we promised to wait until tomorrow, but should we open our gifts now?”



Her breath hitches. She nods. “Please.”



She goes first, tearing into the gold paper like a child, her excitement bubbling over. The moment her 

eyes land on the tag, her face softens, kissable lips parting in wonder.



“Claire…” she breathes. “You didn’t …”



I don’t say anything, just watch as she opens the box, hands shaking more than ever. I watch her expression shift from disbelief to joy. Her eyes fill with tears.



Inside the box is his head.



I cleaned it up as best as I could, wrapping it in plastic to keep the blood from seeping through. His face is frozen in that same sneer he always wore; the one that haunted Lydia for years and scared her whenever it appeared because it meant she was about to get hurt. Now it can never scare her or anyone else ever again.



“I … I don’t know what to say,” she whispers.



I cup her face in my palms like she’s some precious glass angel that fell from a Christmas tree long ago. Her wings were broken by that asshole. I can never truly bring them back, but I made him pay for clipping them. 



I wipe away her tears with my thumb. “You don’t have to say anything, love. You’re safe now.”



For the first time, she doesn’t flinch at the sight of him. She doesn’t cower, doesn’t shrink. She just stares at him, then at me, then back at him, mouth curving into a faint smile.



She takes a deep breath. “Open yours,” she instructs, voice steady now.



I don’t hesitate. The wrapping paper is pristine, folded with typical Lydia precision. I peel it away, revealing the box beneath. My breath catches when I lift the lid. I was right.



There he is; the man who turned my life into a waking nightmare. The man who made me believe I would never be free.



My father.



I haven’t seen him in years, but I would recognise him anywhere. His eyes are wide, expression contorted in terror. Lydia’s work is clean and precise. I should have known she would be good at this. He was afraid before he died. Maybe even as afraid as he made me for my entire childhood and teen years after my mother died from ‘falling down the stairs’. I still can’t smell even a hint of alcohol without panicking. Anyone coming into my bedroom without knocking first makes me spiral so bad that I’m barely functional for hours after. 



Lydia never fails to knock. She knows all my triggers, all the little idiosyncrasies that growing up around that pervert left me with. And she loves me anyway. She really is perfect.



“I love you,” I whisper, tears blurring my vision.



Lydia smiles, leaning in to kiss me on my mouth. “I love you, too. Merry Christmas, Claire. Sorry I got you the same gift you gave me.”



“Just shows we really are meant to be together, since we think so much alike.”



She laughs. “Incorrigible.”



We sit there for a long time, just holding each other, boxes in our laps, the warmth of the fire wrapping around us. Later, we will drive into the woods behind our little cottage in the middle of nowhere and bury the skulls where they will never be found. But for now, the tree twinkles, the snow falls softly outside, and for the first time in either of our lives, Christmas feels like it should.



Perfect.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Water is an essential part of our daily lives, yet many people overlook its importance. Understanding the science behind staying hydrated will help you appreciate why drinking water matters so much. Your body is made up of about 60% water, and this vital fluid plays a crucial role in numerous bodily functions.

How Proper Hydration Affects Your Physical Health
-------------------------------------------------

Did you know that water makes up about 60% of your body? Staying properly hydrated is essential for maintaining your physical health, but many people overlook its importance. This article explores how drinking adequate amounts of water can positively impact various aspects of your wellbeing.

### Boosts Physical Performance

When you engage in physical activity, it is crucial to keep your body hydrated. Dehydration can lead to fatigue and reduced endurance, making workouts feel tougher. Drinking enough water helps to regulate your body temperature and lubricate your joints, allowing you to move more efficiently and avoid injuries.

### Supports Digestion

Water plays a key role in the digestive process. It helps break down food, making nutrients easier to absorb. If you are not drinking enough water, you may become constipated, leading to discomfort and digestive issues. Aim to drink water throughout the day and especially during meals to aid digestion.

### Regulates Body Temperature

Maintaining your body temperature is vital, especially during exercise or in hot weather. Water is crucial for thermoregulation. As you sweat, water evaporates from your skin, cooling you down. If you don’t drink enough water, your body cannot cool itself effectively, which may lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Ensure you drink extra water when you are active or in a hot environment.

### Enhances Skin Health

Staying hydrated promotes healthy skin. When your body lacks water, your skin can become dry, flaky, and less elastic. Drinking enough water helps to keep your skin looking youthful and vibrant by providing the moisture it needs. A well-hydrated body can also help with conditions like acne, dermatitis, and skin infections.

### Boosts Cognitive Function

Your brain is approximately 75% water, and proper hydration has a direct effect on its function. Dehydration can lead to difficulty concentrating, reduced memory, and increased feelings of fatigue. Drinking water throughout your day can help keep your mind sharp and improve your focus, making it easier to tackle daily tasks.

### Aids Weight Management

If you're looking to manage your weight, drinking water can be a helpful tool. Sometimes, our bodies mistake thirst for hunger. By drinking a glass of water before meals, you can feel fuller and potentially consume fewer calories. Additionally, replacing sugary drinks with water helps lower your overall caloric intake, aiding in weight loss.

### Improves Kidney Function

Your kidneys filter waste from your blood, and water helps them do their job. Adequate hydration supports kidney health by helping to flush out toxins and reduce the risk of kidney stones and urinary tract infections. To maintain optimal kidney function, aim to drink plenty of water throughout the day.

### Timely Hydration Tips

Here are some simple tips to improve your hydration habits:

Common Myths About Water Consumption Debunked
---------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, yet many myths surround its consumption. Unraveling these misconceptions can help you make informed choices about your hydration. Let's debunk some of the most common myths regarding water consumption and understand the science behind them.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One of the most popular myths is the guideline of drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, also known as the ""8x8"" rule. While staying hydrated is vital, individual water needs can vary based on age, sex, activity level, and climate. The Institute of Medicine recommends about 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) for men and 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) for women, including all beverages and food sources.

### Myth 2: Thirst Is the Only Indicator You Need Water

Many believe that thirst alone indicates hydration needs. While thirst is a natural signal, it may not always be reliable. Sometimes, by the time you feel thirsty, you may already be mildly dehydrated. It's a good practice to drink water throughout the day, not just when you feel thirsty, to ensure your body stays hydrated.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 3: All Beverages Hydrate You Equally

Many people claim that any liquid counts toward hydration, including coffee and soft drinks. While these beverages do contribute to your daily fluid intake, they are not created equal. Caffeinated drinks can have a mild diuretic effect, meaning they might increase urine output. Therefore, it's best to prioritize plain water and incorporate other hydrating options like herbal teas and fresh fruits.

### Myth 4: If You're Not Active, You Don’t Need Much Water

Even if you're not exercising, hydration is crucial for bodily functions, including temperature regulation, nutrient transport, and waste elimination. Your body loses water through sweating, breathing, and even digestion, so it's important to maintain a consistent intake of fluids, regardless of activity level.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 5: Drinking Water Aids in Weight Loss

While no magic potion exists for weight loss, drinking water can support your efforts. Some studies suggest that drinking water before meals may help you eat less, as it fills your stomach, leading to lower calorie intake. However, it’s not a standalone solution. Pairing proper hydration with a balanced diet and regular exercise is the key to effective weight management.

### Myth 6: You Can Overhydrate

Although dehydration is a common concern, overhydration, or water intoxication, is also possible but rare. When you consume excessive amounts of water in a short period, it can dilute sodium levels in your bloodstream, leading to a condition called hyponatremia. It’s crucial to listen to your body's signals and hydrate appropriately without over-exertion.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 7: Special Types of Water Are Necessarily Better

With the rise of bottled water, flavored water, and alkaline water, many people believe these options are superior to regular tap water. However, the benefits are often overstated. For most people, tap water is safe, nutritious, and much more sustainable. Additionally, many bottled waters are just tap water with added minerals or flavors, so don't be swayed by marketing terms.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

- **Carry a reusable water bottle:** This convenient option encourages regular sips throughout the day.
- **Set reminders:** Use your phone or apps to remind you to drink water.
- **Flavor your water:** Add fresh fruit, herbs, or citrus to enhance taste without added sugar.
- **Monitor urine color:** Clear or light yellow urine indicates proper hydration, while dark yellow signifies the need for more fluids.

Staying informed about common myths surrounding water consumption can empower you to manage your hydration more effectively. Remember, knowledge is the key to maintaining good health. Don't rely solely on popular sayings—listen to your body and drink what feels right for you.

Debunking these common myths not only clarifies misconceptions but also encourages healthier habits. Keep the science behind hydration in mind, and you can make choices that greatly benefit your well-being.

1hjo53r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hjo53r/aio/,AIO,My wife of 10 years and I have four kids eight six three and one I got lost and work and sleeping and lost track of family and away trying to catch bills up she then lost love and started looking other places never told me what the problem was always hinted that it was something different then she tells me it's over probably about 4 months ago stays in my house for 3 more months after that during that last 3 months I was going to work coming home from work I would then spend an hour with her she would go to work for her 3 hours of work in that 3 hours while she was at work I would clean the house I would do the laundry I would cat pans dishes the whole nine yards I would set up a bath so when she walked in the door she was literally walked right into a bath I would then roll three or four blunts and go smoke one with her while she was relaxing in the bath and then I would go back to my room and wait for her to get out and we would then smoke again and I would rub her feet her back her neck whatever she may want and that was my day literally for three whole months trying to make everything that I was doing incorrectly better and show her that I could change meanwhile at the very end of that 3 months I catch her talking to another guy I asked her to stop talking to that guy and she wouldn't so I asked again and with this second time it was with the demand that if you can't stop that you needed to leave and two days later she left and took our four kids I've been able to go over a couple times and see them for a little bit and the first couple times the youngest daughter would barely look at me and was kind of almost felt like she was creeped out by me my oldest daughter will not even come up to me runs away from me and my boys are a little bit older and they miss me but they're having fun playing in a new place and having all their toys out and about because they took everything from this house 2 weeks go by with me seeing my kids probably three times for about a half an hour probably and that was basically because I was running stuff over there for them the first time I went over there her mom actually jumped my ass because they didn't have food and she didn't have boots and I didn't have a car I got my car back from the shop about 12 hours later after that and I got a hold of them to be able to take boots over there that I was so much of a butthole for not taking them over there when I didn't even have access to my car and I had the rest of my car loaded up with basically every bit of food that was left in this house I left myself a box of cereal two boxes of mac and cheese a box of Rice-A-Roni and some canned soups and a couple cans of vegetables got it all in the car message them asking if I could come around a I think it was 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon a decent time to drop off all this stuff that I was so mean for not dropping off before when I didn't have access to a vehicle but now I'm trying to and I get told that it is an inconvenience to them to do it right now so I literally end up taking half the food back out of my car back into the house back into the fridge or back into the freezer and have to wait till the next day to be able to go and take them this stuff that I got chewed out for so needless to say I took all this food over there and their boots and all the kids snow gear and all their toys and I literally moved all her stuff out of the house she packed up one time out of the three times that we have taken trips of stuff over there she only packed up I moved everything for the most part and use my car to take the stuff to her use my own gas 2 weeks down the road of dealing with that type of crazy situation she then asked me if she can come over and pack the one time she come over and pack stuff and I had no problem with that I went over picked her up brought her all the way to my house let her pack up everything that she wanted to pack up carried it out to the car and took her home and the whole nine yards so then we get to her house I'm like okay let me take the boys and let them spend the night so they spend the night for the next two nights with me the first night was great I woke up about 2 hours after going to sleep and they were snoring in it so it sound that hasn't been in my house that I have missed so horribly that when it was back I literally stayed up for the next 4 hours just listening to them snore I end up passing back out wake up in the morning and my sons are talking about how their Uncle has been doing this with them and been doing that with them and then took them to go to a Clay pit and walking through the woods and finding rocks and all this stuff letting them do front flips off of them and just constantly keep talking about what their uncle's been doing for him and then one of them slipped and it wasn't their uncle they were talking about they were talking about the guy that was the reason why I asked her to either stop talking or leave while my kids are continuously after that telling me how he plays with both my youngest daughters and I ain't even able to see them but you have another man already inside a house that you just moved into playing around with my children like he's their father in some way or something meanwhile they keep talking and one of them then says something along the lines of I walked in on mommy and so and so kissing and it was weird to then go on and tell me to that this man is also staying the night meanwhile after finding all this out I am sitting at my house and she messages me for her black high heel boots that she so needs so I grab them put them in the car while my boys are literally packing up the rest of anything and everything that's in their bedroom and then she also remembers to ask me because she needs diapers because the $40 that I dropped off last week didn't cover anything diaper-wise or wipe wise I don't know what it went to but so I end up going and getting diapers too anyways and take my boys back to their mom and unload my car of all their stuff but they wanted so badly but it broke me because now there's nothing in my house basically to remind me of anything of my family and I take all this stuff in I give her her boots I give the diapers and I tell her not to be mad at the kids but the kids slipped up and said what you ask them not to she knew we need to talk we talked for a while and she doesn't say anything wrong with what she's doing I'm guessing but I feel like there's no reason at all that another man should already be around my children that you're having another man literally sleep inside the same f****** house as my children that this man is walking my children around through the woods like he's their stepfather already and you have even left my house for you ain't even gone for 3 weeks and then when I try to tell her how I feel that I didn't want any of this to happen I don't want my family to separate I tried working on it so f****** hard I literally started this day love this girl beyond anything it's beyond stupid but like I said to her it's beyond mentally crushing when you haven't seen your kids for 2 weeks and then you finally get some time with them and the whole time you're with them they're talking about another man and how he does all this stuff because he's trying to be so proving and be the good guy in the beginning of the relationship even knowing I know in the back of my head deep down that the dude is a drunk alcoholic abusive piece of s***I even made the comment to where she has no clue how hard it is to have your daughter literally run away from you while your oldest son comes over and then tells you that David and Harley are playing all the f****** time together since you since mommy left you and she sits with a straight face and has no emotion about any of it she feels bad because I hurt and she doesn't want me to hurt myself but beyond that she has no emotion she has no care she has no nothing like she doesn't even think about what she's doing to our kids having another man around that f****** soon when she doesn't even know him and I'm stuck where I can't do anything because I literally spent my whole life trying to please the woman of my child and never focused on myself always been every bit of money on her or our family and never did anything like literally I've had my no license for the last almost 10 years because I've been more worried about putting money into this house and making sure she was happy with iced coffee everyday then I was about me having a driver's license while driving down the f****** road forever fixing and filing my taxes in 10 years that we were together because I was always worried about only her aspect of everything and getting the house Bill's worried about and I was going to fix myself and everything with myself once the bills of the house and she was set open because I was looking out to make sure that her and my family were taken care of before ever worrying about anything to fix me to be an adult or care about my life if I didn't have my family so those who might try to comment go to court take her for custody it's not anything I can do right now so please don't but any other advice or any other comments you want to leave I'm open to reading im

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking primarily for an online friendship, but am open to something slightly flirty if that happens naturally. I am *not* looking for something primarily nsfw, so if that’s what you are looking for, I am most definitely not your girl. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, as opposed to a one off conversation, but that would depend on how well we click! 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. I am willing to share sfw photos, but please done ask unless you are willing to share as well! If my post interest you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

Hi there.
 I’m currently waiting to get some health insurance set up to finally see a doctor and I’m waiting in a lot of pain. I’d love to have a dad figure to call often and hopefully befriend. I deal with a lot of depression and anxiety and take medications for it. I also walk, listen to music, color, clean, do yoga and meditate to manage. However sometimes when you’re in a lot of pain, you just sit still. 

When I’m more lively I enjoy reality tv shows, going out to coffee shops, and going to the gym.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately. Like \*most\* of the women I have seen or known that I want ot be like are arguably very much ""not girly"", tend towards misandry, and if they are cute, are cute in the way where they might cute, are cute in the was where they might also talk about knives and revenge and whatnot(the Nimona precident).

Most of the female artists I listen to (Aston, Ashnikko, Chinchilla, Girli, etc) are very much definitively NOT demure, and the idea of being demure, or stroking mens egos makes me want to barf.

There is so soft side that is more like goddess-core, strong feminine power stuff, and like, yeah, the obligatory catgirl side \*of course\*.

I just wonder wether anyone else relates, or if I'm just hardened by the world, and missing out on a side of my feminine identity that some of y'all beauties could tell me about.

**A Day in the Life: The Sonar Shack and Fire Control Party**

  
*As a qualified undersea warrior, I dedicate this story to our beloved Sonar-men—those vigilant souls who keep us safe beneath the waves and ensure we always find our way back home.  -  E. Ryle TSV*



# Picture this: a quiet mid-watch. The control room hums with the sounds of sonar pings, distant whirring machinery, and the occasional muffled snore from the Diving Officer, who insists he's ""just resting his eyes."" Suddenly, the crisp call comes through:



# ""SONAR, CONN—Contact bearing 187, range 12,000 yards, classification: merchant.""

  
The control team perks up, all eyes on Sonar. The Captain strolls in, coffee in hand, and gives his trademark command: ""Let me know if it's a fishing boat or an underwater Death Star.""



https://preview.redd.it/60fcc707ta8e1.png?width=673&format=png&auto=webp&s=167f6bc111a09527c91ca8f40dcfef75f8e4ec76

  
**The Fire Control Tracking Party: A Symphony of Shadows**

  
The scene shifts to a more intense moment. The sonar screen lights up like a digital fireworks display, the lines and traces weaving like spaghetti, each squiggle a potential threat or ally. Suddenly, a call from Sonar pierces the silence:

""CONN, SONAR—possible enemy submarine, bearing 090, range 8,000 yards, depth unknown!""

Enter the Sonar Supervisor, his hair defying Navy grooming standards, reminiscent of Elvis at his most pompous. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out his trusty comb, and with a flourish, combs back through his locks, transforming into the maestro of this underwater symphony. He then picks up his fictional conducting wand—a broken diving knife handle from a bygone era—and the performance begins.

""Fire Control, prepare to track!"" shouts the Officer of the Deck (OOD), his voice echoing the urgency. The fire control tracking party, a mix of eager young sailors and seasoned veterans, leap into action. They start calculating angles, speeds, and courses, their fingers dancing over controls like they're playing a high-stakes video game.

https://preview.redd.it/bpzy4sqfta8e1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=3af50098ce218ad2c1c474cb9f186adbcfffe693

Meanwhile, the Chief of the Watch, with his hand hovering near the ""chicken switches""—those emergency systems meant for dire circumstances—fantasizes about the moment he might get to use them, though he knows it's unlikely. His attention shifts back to his panel, ready to move water from tank to tank upon command, subtly shifting the boat's buoyancy and balance.

As the OOD barks orders to dive deeper, the helmsman adjusts the submarine's course with a finesse that belies the tension. The Sonar Supervisor, with a mischievous grin, orchestrates the dance of evasion and pursuit, his voice steady:

""Mark contact! Angle on the bow, port 30... steady as she goes!""

  
The sonar team, with their magical ability to see through the ocean's depths via digital waves, track the enemy's every move. They're the silent hunters, their equipment humming and beeping like a chorus, each note crucial in this underwater ballet of cat and mouse.

The Ping Monkey at the broadband console prays for the enemy to make a noise, any noise, so he can justify his existence with a single button press.

https://preview.redd.it/uaw9efhlta8e1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=962b34a6bf0eb40b51f9daca4552c70d8a8948cb

* The Starstruck Apprentice at the narrowband console, eyes wide, watches the Supervisor like he's at a rock concert, ready to learn the secret codes of the deep.
* The Sonar Seagull, the Assistant Supervisor, offers unsolicited advice, floating around like he's searching for the next fish to squawk at.
* The Sonar Moth, mesmerized by the UI console, adds to the chaos with his fascination for the blinking lights, hoping his button presses mean something this time.
* The Sonar Snack, the junior operator, logs everything with enthusiasm, proving that even the smallest cog in this machine has a role.
* The Eternal Nub on standby, still learning the ropes, fumbles but is eager, waiting for the day he's no longer the ""new guy.""

Finally, with the enemy tracked and outflanked, the tension breaks as the Captain declares, ""Well done, team. Let's give them a show they'll never forget."" And the sonar team look to their supervisor with high fives out of ""Top Gun,"" some man hugs, and fist bumps. But the junior gets a little too close, prompting the Sonar Supervisor to put up his hand, ""Easy, shipmate, watch the hair! Anyone seen my can of styling mousse?""

  
With that, the sonar team and control return to the normal hums and beeps, and the submarine slips away into the silent depths, leaving behind only echoes of their presence.

**But then, as the submarine fades into the dream's horizon, reality comes crashing in...…**

https://preview.redd.it/4gvkwc3qta8e1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=83ae3090192a0774a8168bbca2aeff4301b82544

**A Different Kind of Battle**

From the depths of his gaming den, where he has masterfully recreated the ambiance of a submarine control room with an array of screens, a retired Sonar Supervisor, now known in the digital world as ""CaptainSilentEchos,"" dives into nightly battles in Cold Waters. His fingers dance over the keyboard like they once did over sonar consoles, his eyes sharp on the screen, tracking virtual contacts with the precision of his younger days.

By day, he navigates the mundane waters of a defense contracting job, but by night, he's the revered ""CaptainSilentEchos,"" a legend on the servers, leading his squad with tactics forged in the silent depths. His players, unknowingly following in the footsteps of a true sonar master, execute maneuvers with the precision of his past crew.

  
After an intense session, where he outwitted and outmaneuvered virtual foes with the finesse of a real-life sonar duel, the clock strikes 2:30 AM. He leans back, his reflection in the monitor showing a man whose hair has lost the battle with time but whose mind is still sharp, still commanding the digital waves.

And then, his epic journey is interrupted:

**""Wake up, Captain Echofin!** The Kraken’s attacking our living room, and Commodore Sonar Nuggle Bear needs you!"" His wife’s voice, playful yet commanding, slices through the digital silence, pulling him from the depths of his virtual command back to the reality where his true victories now lie.

He steps away from the screen, his hand resting on the mouse, a familiar weight in his fingers. As he rises from the chair, he looks at the framed picture of his family on the wall, a reminder that while the battles in the virtual world may be fierce, they pale in comparison to the battlefields of real life. The true victories aren’t won on the screens or in the depths of the ocean but in the moments shared with the people who matter the most.

https://preview.redd.it/i58qtctzta8e1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf274c29157e01a034c200bf598abb43a147565f

Before leaving the room, he pauses and looks around. In that moment, he recalls the camaraderie of his shipmates, the ones who stood beside him through everything: the long, silent nights in the sonar shack, the stressful and tense days when every decision felt like a life-or-death choice. He remembers the grins and the jokes, the inside laughs, and the shared victories. He recalls the moments when, despite the odds, they came through for each other, no matter what. Those bonds, forged deep beneath the sea, still echo through his heart.

He smiles as he walks out of the room, knowing that though his days of commanding the silent depths are behind him, the legacy of his journey—both in the deep sea and in his home—will always echo in the hearts of those he loves, and in the memories of the shipmates who stood watch with him.

**They’ll never be forgotten.**

I get why you'd add it to coffee or cocoa (to make it less bitter) and honey has a nice taste to it but why do people eat frosting at all? It's just paste, it's only paste, why do people just add flavorless paste to their food? What does it add?

Also soda is just bad carbonated kombucha but everyone acts like kombucha isn't just a straight upgrade from regular soda, I guess because it actually tastes like what the can says it turns them off?

After living my life wondering why people will actually seek out frosting on their food willingly I decided to ask why? Please tell me if I'm just missing something because I really don't get the appeal.

Milkshakes also make sense but they're milky with different flavors  like chocolate, vanilla and strawberry but I don't see where this mystical ""sweet"" is, only that some have more flavor and others people say are ""sweet"" that are actually just bland

Some days before I was diagnosed I felt like I was dying some days (almost fainting, heart palpitations, pain, etc) and wasn’t diagnosed exactly until a few months ago after an endoscopy. I then was in the hospital on Thanksgiving and told I had gastritis along with GERD and IBS. My pain was at an all time worse, my reflux however wasn’t so bad aside from vagus nerve pain and chest pain. 

Well after I was in the hospital I was put on 40mg of pantoprazole for 3 weeks and took mylanta as necessary (I’d say I took mylanta once every 2-3 days on average) I stopped taking my medicine about 5 days ago and went cold turkey. That was definitely rough with the acid reflux the first few days…up until yesterday. 

Yesterday and today are very different, for the first time in a month about I am not having severe pain from acid in my stomach (meaning my gastritis is healing) but am having some acid reflux (the vagus nerve pain is the worse)

 I still have a long way to go but after feeling completely hopeless and depressed I believe I am moving in a very positive direction and hope I can give everyone here hope.

Healing…

Well to begin with, I ate for the past month very bland, all cooked meals (most days chicken rice a starch and vegetable). Obviously have to stay away from alcohol coffee and fatty foods. I have got away with things like skim milk, non fat yogurt, most fruits, wheat bread pb&js, tuna fish, etc. 

I started working out pretty hard, I was doing cross fit but have slowed down to just good workouts with lots of walking and some running. 

Stress is huge, I actually have not stressed about much lately (I’ll tell myself to breathe and calm down to reduce acid building up) and I’ll take warm-hot showers and stretch. 

The diet is most important though in my opinion, you have to keep it pretty strict, that also means passing on events and such sometimes. I’ve felt very depressed over this but it can get better. This weekend I had to cancel 2 things to take time to rest before Christmas and focus on my gut health. That is okay and hopefully your family and friends can be understanding. 

Tonight I had eggs, chicken, potatoes, rice, and a wheat English muffin. Honestly a simple meal for me that wouldn’t trigger anything. I did give in and had a small powered donut and a few chocolate chip cookies (yes I cheat meal once in a blue moon) I’ve had mainly vagus nerve issues tonight and a little stomach ache but not too much pain just brain fog. 

I felt so lost, I thought I was gonna actually die a few months ago. I had to leave work a few times, cry in the car ride home, call people panicking, etc. 

I am obviously still healing, but I do feel like things are a lot better and in a better direction. 

This started around when I tore my acl, I also drank a decent amount on weekends and something else traumatic happened to me shortly after getting acl surgery. I would say all that combined triggered everything. 

There was days I did not want to get up, I would (sometimes still) feel lost, feel like death really. 

However,  Things can get better! try to get off ppi to get your system back to normal, use mylanta as needed (tums, Pepcid etc) and eat home cooked meals, salads, and fruit. 

You got this! Remember clean foods. If you’re out somewhere just do your best to look for healthy choices. I went to nyc last week and packed a wheat pb&j, graham crackers, applesauce, cheerios, grapes. Had a bland salad at a pizzeria (trust me that’s tough lmao) and then had a grilled chicken wrap with no dressing. 

Lastly, stay away from condiments. It’s tough but do able. I still eat salads no dressing now and tuna fish with no mayo, things like that.

To be clear, I wouldn’t wish my job away. I love what I do, am so thankful for the financial security it’s helped us build, and have so much of what I wished for years ago (ability to travel to great places, a C-suite role, opportunities to speak at events, etc). I noticed last week that my W-2 comp will pass $400k this year with my LTIP and bonus from end of year last year, and I would have never imagined that was a number I’d make. 

But gosh, it’s a lot. I took on a new team again three months ago and I now oversee 40 people after being a team of 1 at this startup 4 years ago. I travelled 75 nights this year and have become our CEO’s right hand person for sales activities and networking events to sell our business. I oversee a team expanded beyond my SME role and it seems like there is so dang much to do and I’m wearing 4 hats and working 45-50 hours a week too. The introverted extrovert in me enjoys travel when I’m in the thick of it, but the last six weeks of being home straight (something I haven’t had most of the year) makes me know I will miss this when I head back out for 16 days of travel in January. My 7-year-old is growing up so dang fast and I am so enjoying quiet morning coffees and snuggle time with my dogs and being home. Even though I work remote when not traveling, my days are still 8 hours of calls and they still feel like a blur.

I feel like I’m always rushing from thing to thing, and I’m juggling them all and doing ok but it’s like Groundhog Day - 5 AM workout, walk dogs, get ready and kiddo ready and off to school, sit at my desk for 8-9 hours (often grabbing lunch at my desk), dinner, bath or shower, kid to bed, read a r watch a mindless show, sleep, repeat. 

I think I need to set some better boundaries and lean on my EA a bit more. Maybe I’m just a little tired and burned out. I want to slow down just a little and feel more present and not like life is just blowing by so fast. 

Anyone else living it too? Or have tips?
