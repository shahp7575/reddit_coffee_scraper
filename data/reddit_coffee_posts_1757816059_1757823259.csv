1nghem4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nghem4,"“SUNNY DAYS COFFEE” in Kagoshima, Japan","I had a wonderful experience with their coffee, cheesecake, and tiramisu here. Their coffee was bold and aromatic yet smooth, carrying a nice balance of bitterness and depth. It paired beautifully with the desserts. Their cheesecake was truly outstanding, rich, creamy, yet light enough to keep me wanting another bite. It had just the right balance of sweetness and tang, making it one of the best cheesecakes I’ve ever had. Their tiramisu was equally delightful, with layers of soft cream and coffee-soaked sponge blending perfectly. It had that authentic homemade feel, not too sweet, with a gentle cocoa finish. The cafe itself was warm and welcoming, filled with vintage touches and a relaxed atmosphere that made me just want to feel everything😍",1,1757822662.0,u_5second10,0,1.0,False

It will be our first time in the city and we are looking for recommendations. We do not have an exact number for our budget, but since it is our first time we do not mind splurging a little (if within reason). As for interests, we love trying different kinds of cuisines, checking out museums, learning about the history of cities, sightseeing, searching for the best cup of coffee, music festivals, and just having a good time. We will be staying in a hotel in the Whitechapel area near Aldgate East Station. We plan to use the tubes to get around unless there is a better alternative (Uber?).

No matter how many bones or toys I left around, he always went for the stuff he wasn’t supposed to.

I finally realized he needed something a little more interactive, so I started doing regular short tug sessions throughout the day. I keep a couple cheap rope toys in every room and just pause what I’m doing to play for a few minutes. I also started rotating toys every few days to keep them feeling new. It made a huge difference—he’s way more chill and doesn’t sneak off to gnaw furniture anymore.

It’s kind of wild how such a simple change helped so much. Anyone else’s dog do this?",1,1757822503.0,DogsToDogs,0,1.0,False
1nghch1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nghch1/night_moves_1_of_2/,Night Moves (1 of 2),"“It’s going to happen, Jack. Nothing we can do about it. The wheels are already in motion. Higher-ups tell me I need to release the staff by the end of the week.”

“Then ‘AM 640 - Talk of the Town’ becomes what, exactly?”

Ron sighed. “Another DJ-less, auto-programmed, adult easy listening station.”

“Aww, Christ on a bike,” I said. “They’re stealing the soul of this industry. Our Arbitron numbers grew last ratings cycle.”

“Late stage capitalism at its finest,” he said, leaning back in his chair. It squeaked as if it had something to add. “All the companies are cutting costs. Dying industry and all.”

“Feel like I’m surrounded by death these days.”

Ron leaned forward on his elbows. With a deep breath, he started speaking in a quiet, measured tone. “When I was knee high to a grasshopper, had an old boss named Terrence ‘Dials’ Pullman. Man used to drop pearls of wisdom like a clam Santa Claus. The lesson that always stuck with me was, ‘When the Chief calls for war, the braves grab their hatchets,’” he said with a sigh. “Chief BrightStar Radio called for war. I’m just grabbing my hatchet.”

I slumped. My mind raced. I’d just renewed the lease on my apartment, for God’s sake! I passed up a job in Santa Fe last month because I had a good feeling about this gig. Now? Now I was about to be another unemployed radio DJ. Worse, an unemployed DJ lacking a massive, loyal audience to support his transition into a podcast host.

“Wanna smoke? I know you gave ‘em up, but….”

“Yes,” I said without hesitation. I’d given them up about a year ago to help save my golden pipes. If I were going to be the voice of Night Moves Radio, the local, overnight call-in show for the Valley, I felt like it was important to treat my instrument better than I had in the past. What a waste.

Despite the no-smoking signs throughout the station, Ron knocked out two Marlboro Reds, tossed me one, and offered a light. The return of smoke to my body was not welcome. The first puff made my mouth tingle, and that sent a message to the rest of my body that a smoke attack was incoming. I started hacking instantly.

I remembered why I’d quit these.

“That’s your good sense fighting your worst instincts,” Ron said.

“Me all over,” I said, hacking in between each word. “Can I tell the audience?”

Ron exhaled a cloud of smoke. I watched it float up and dissipate as it hit the nicotine-stained ceiling. Obviously, this wasn’t his first office smoking session. “Gotta keep it under our hat for now. I know it ain’t easy, but as a personal favor to me, can you pick up your hatchet?”

I nodded, took one last cough-fueled pull before putting the butt out on the bottom of my shoe. A powerful desire to leave the office seized me. Despite knowing it wasn’t his call, Ron had just laid me off. If I hung around, I was liable to make an unpleasant situation worse.

Ron sensed it. “Sorry to be the bearer of shit news, Jack. I hate it too.”

“Still gotta grab that hatchet, right?”

He pointed his smoke at me and shot me a small smile. “Attaboy.”

As soon as the door closed behind me, I threw up two middle fingers and mouthed a string of phrases not fit for public consumption. Or so I thought. While I stood there, mouthing a curse into the wild, I heard a shoe squeak behind me.

“You feeling okay, Jack?”

It was Manny, our vending machine guy. There was no way he didn’t see me just silently lose my shit. I plastered on a smile and turned to face him. “Manny! How goes the wonderful world of vending?”

“Same shit, bro. Seriously though, you good?”

“Office drama. You know how that goes.”

“Hell yeah, I do. Charlie, this dude at my job, is always pissing me off. It’s like, if you don’t want someone eating your food, put your name on the bag, bro. Whatever. He’s got bigger issues than that,” Manny said, miming injecting a needle into his arm. “He left, like two weeks ago, and ain’t come back.”

“Common in your industry?”

“Strange shit happens all the time in this job. Some dudes can’t hang. Like, check this out. Last week, I stopped to grab a Slurpee, and I heard this guy….”

“Manny, your nose is bleeding,” I interrupted. He touched his face and rolled his eyes. I handed him a tissue.

“Third time tonight, man.”

“Must be the dry air,” I said, glancing at the clock. “I’ve gotta run. Feel better, man!”

I left Manny and made my way to the studio. The place wasn’t much to look at, but it felt lived in. These walls looked jaundiced. The carpet was gritty in spots. There was an odd funk we couldn’t air out. But it was home. In the middle of the room sat two consoles where my amazing and loyal producer Daphne and I worked. Off in the corner was a small booth where our intern sat and screened calls.

Daphne saw my face and instantly knew. She was livid. Hell, I’d never seen her angrier. “Did Ron give you the whole chief/brave thing?” With my positive response, she rolled her eyes. “Such bullshit. You know he’s keeping his job, right? Actually, he’s getting a small pay bump.”

I placed my piping hot coffee mug near the console. “Everything’s coming up Milhouse for him, huh?”

Daphne didn’t hear me. The mug held her attention. If I had a dime for every time she “gently reminded” me not to put my coffee mug near the equipment, I wouldn’t have to worry about losing this job. I removed my mug, leaving only a faint brown ring of coffee where it once stood. Without asking, she handed me a paper towel.

“How did you find out about Ron’s raise?”

“Cathy in HR is a horrible gossip. Plus, I confirmed it online. BrightStar is doing this to twenty-five AM stations across the country.”

“On the plus side, we’re on the cutting edge of modern radio strategy,” I said, cleaning up my little mess. “AI is going to make the world a better place, ya know?”

“AI can eat my ass,” Daphne said.

“I think it’s programmed not to do those sorts of things.”

“That’s why it’ll never take off,” she said in a huff. “Uneaten asses.”

A nerve-breaking burst of high-pitched static shot out from the speakers in the studio. I jumped and nearly dropped my coffee. Daphne would’ve killed me. She slapped the speaker with her palm, and the noise stopped. The jolt not only hurt her hand but also caused the overhead lights to strobe for a few seconds before they stilled.

“You okay?”

“Fine. I’d cut this hand off if it’d save this place. I don’t have a backup plan, Jack.”

“Outside of selling tasteful foot pics, I don’t either.”

“To continue this depressing news streak, how do you want to handle today’s show? I have a killer suggestion that might just bring out the weirdos tonight.”

Call-in shows are notorious for crank callers. Crackpots are a dedicated bunch. We keep a blacklist of people who’ve burned us. Most of the time, it’s racists or edge-lords. Ollie, our fabulous intern, has gotten fantastic at catching dog whistles in the pre-screenings.

They’d come to us about two months ago and instantly became integral to the running of the show. Ollie dreamed of being an on-air talent and was willing to do the grunt work to get there. I was hoping we’d be able to hire them for the show post-school. Barring a miracle, that wouldn’t be happening now. I hate the modern world.

“Let’s let the weirdos have the run of things tonight,” I said. “You have any red meat for them?”

“Boy, do I,” Daphne asked. “But you sure? We’ve had some unhinged callers lately. Something in the air, maybe.”

“More unhinged than normal?”

“Way more than normal, boss,” Ollie said, walking into the room. “One guy swears he’s a werewolf sent here by God to rid the world of stray cats and Belgian people. He also hates trans people. Mentions it every call…then tells me I have a sweet voice.”

“Is trans hatred part of his godly mission, too?”

“That seems to be more of a personal belief than a mission from God. He saves his true ire for ‘those filthy waffle eaters. ’”

“The other night, a caller told me there are clues on how the world’s going to end hidden on the back of cereal boxes,” Daphne said.

“Oh, Frank?” Ollie said, their face beaming. “He’s nice, but I think he has a vendetta against Cap’n Crunch for some reason.”

“Maybe the good Cap’n got promoted over him,” I offered.

“Story as old as time. Cap’n got to sail on the SS Guppy and Frank got nothing,” Ollie said. Based on our confused glances, they filled us in. “The SS Guppy is Cap’n Crunch’s ship. Fun fact, he sails the Milk Sea, his first mate is Seadog, and his rival is barefoot pirate Jean LaFoote.”

“How do you know all of this?” Daphne asked, dumbfounded.

Ollie shrugged. “ADHD, a love of cereal lore, and unlimited internet access as a kid.”

I laughed. “I needed that.”

“Did you need it because of the whole, ya know,” Ollie dragged their thumb across their neck. I nodded. Ollie sighed. “I heard earlier. Sucks a big dong.”

“A freakishly huge one. Ripley’s level huge. ‘Feel-it-in-your-lungs’ huge.” Ollie and I both gave Daphne a sideways look. She shrugged. “Am I wrong here?”

“No, but give me the name of the ‘lungs’ dude,” Ollie joked.

I glanced up at the clock. It was game time. “Screw it. Tonight, we let the freak flags fly.”

“Ron won’t be mad?” Ollie asked.

“What is he going to do? Fire us?”

“Hell yeah,” Daphne said. “Let’s get crazy. I have a hot story that’ll bring’em out, too.”

“Hands in,” I said, getting everyone to do our pre-show huddle. “We’re bruised, we’re battered, and we’re going to be unemployed in a week, but we’re good people. Let’s do the best show we can tonight. Night Moves on three - one, two, three.”

“Night moves,” we all said in unison before splintering off to get started with the broadcast.

I took my seat and heard the sultry voice of Bob Seger starting off the show. I placed my cans on, cleared my throat, and leaned into the microphone, waiting for Daphne’s signal. After a beat, she pointed at me.

“It’s eleven o’clock in the Valley that never sleeps. It’s time for Night Moves with Jack Mann. I’m here to guide you down this dark path, past the witching hour, and on to the moment the sun’s first rays catch our eyes. Hope you had a good day, but good days make for bad radio, so let’s hear some gripes, concerns, stories, and scares. Daphne, how are things in your neck of the woods this evening?”

“Hanging in there.”

“Best we can do in these uncertain times.”

“That said, Jack, do I have a wild story to share with you tonight.”

“Love it. Hit me,” I said.

“The other day, I was browsing Reddit, and found a local legend that I thought might be fun to kick us off.”

“This is from Reddit, people, so take it with a grain of salt.”

“The saltiest of salts,” Daphne said. “But have you heard about the South Street Wanderer?”

“I have not. Ollie?” I said, glancing at them. Ollie shrugged their shoulders. “Zero for two on us knowing about the South Street Wanderer, Daph.”

“It’s the Valley’s own local ghost legend. Apparently, all along South Street, people report seeing a figure lurking in the shadows at all hours of the day. It doesn’t hide, but it avoids people…until it doesn’t.” Daphne played a “shocking music” sting to underline her tale.

I chuckled. “What happens then?”

“Promises to warn you about a potential future disaster…IF you spread the word about the encounter. I don’t know how he keeps track, though.”

“So, he hides from people unless they agree to be his hype man?”

“It would seem so.”

“Why would he want that?”

“His mixtape ain’t gonna sell itself, Jack,” Ollie said, an assassin sniping a joke from the mic we kept in the call screening room.

“Phones don’t answer themselves, Ollie,” Daphne said. As she did, the lights in the studio flickered but stayed on. Given our run of luck, the power going out and us not being able to broadcast would be par for the course. Thankfully, something out there loved us, because the power stayed flowing.

“I liked it, Ollie,” I said, nodding to the call screen booth.

“I have to admit that the Wanderer’s mixtape is fire. Not a coincidence, considering that people complain about burning sensations after they speak with him.”

“Wait, what?” I asked. “He gave them an STD?”

“Didn’t read that, thank God. People report that after hearing their predictions, they sometimes get a burning sensation in their chest. Others say they get a pain like an electric shock. A few have mentioned getting days-long headaches, oozing rashes, violent nosebleeds, and nightmares.”

“Not ideal, but who wouldn’t exchange a migraine for future safety? And honestly, is there anything worse than a rash?” I asked.

“The other reported effects are bleeding from pores, coma, and death.”

I waited a beat. “Still not as bad as itchy skin, right?”

Daphne laughed. “I’d rather itch than bleed from my eyes or, ya know, die. A coma, though, sounds nice. Coma dreams have to be wild. A brain free from the waking world might produce some interesting insights.”

“Maybe how to make radio more lucrative,” I said. Daphne grinned and shot me a look. I was out of fucks to give.

The lights above us flickered once more. Again, the power held. I looked at Daphne, who shrugged. She started jotting something down and held up a pad of paper with her message: BrightStar already not paying the power bill?

I stifled a laugh. “So, Valley dwellers, have any of you interacted with the South Street Wanderer? Know someone who has? Hell, if you are the South Street Wanderer and want to tell your side of the story, we’re ready to hear you out.”

“But don’t give us any predictions. My skin is already in awful shape, can’t add bloody pores to the equation.”

A few seconds later, the phone calls started coming in. Ollie, ready to go forward with the weirdos, was quickly talking to callers and jotting down brief messages for both Daphne and me to see. On my screen, it read: “Line 1: Joe saw s.s.w. at 7-11.” I glanced over at Ollie, who was grinning from ear to ear.

“Oh, we’ve got a live one here. Joe on line one says he saw the South Street Wanderer getting a Slurpee at 7-Eleven. Did I get that right, Joe?”

We all waited for Joe to speak up. When noise started coming from the other end of the phone, it was heavy breathing. All of us have been in this game long enough to have a good guess about what this guy was up to. Typically, we hang up. Today? Today we’re gonna ride it out.

“Joe, sounds like you have your hands full.”

“Sorry, sorry,” came a panicked-sounding voice on the other end. “I’m out walking my dogs. But yeah, I saw that guy at 7-Eleven, like two days ago. Well, outside the 7-Eleven. On South Street and Washington.”

“What was he doing?” Daphne asked.

“Hiding on the side of the building.”

“He wasn’t getting a Big Bite hot dog?”

“No,” Joe said with a slight chuckle. “At first, I thought he was a homeless dude. There’s usually a few guys there asking for cigarettes. They’re harmless. The thing I saw, though, made my blood run cold.”

“Why?”

Joe sighed. “Something felt off. He was in the shadows, but the area directly around him was like, like, darker than the rest of the night. And there was a fog around him. Almost like he was standing in a storm cloud.”

“What was he doing?”

“Watching. Not just my actions, but also my thoughts. My memories. He was…Biscuit! No! Drop it! Sorry, my dog got into some trash.”

“So it was an eerie vibe or….”

“I mean, yes, but more than that. I could feel him in my brain. Not physically, but supernaturally. Felt like he was trying to get my attention without speaking.”

“Thank God he wasn’t in your mind, Jack,” Daphne joked.

“God has no home there,” I said.

“It’s not a joke,” Joe said, his voice firm. “Especially when I heard a voice I didn’t recognize inside my brain.”

“I’ve had that before. Recently, actually,” Daphne said. “You sure it wasn’t your conscience playing tricks on you?”

“No,” Joe said definitively. “I know it sounds crazy, but he was there. I heard another voice that wasn’t mine. And I wasn’t even drunk or high.”

“What was the voice saying?” I asked as I jotted down a note on a notepad. I flashed it to Daphne. It read: This going somewhere?? She nodded ‘yes’ and I let the man ramble.

“It was all gibberish at first. Like spinning a radio dial, looking for the right station.”

“AM 640, the voice of the Valley,” I expertly chimed in.

“Right,” Joe said, nervously laughing, “just half words, foreign words, blips and beeps until it found the right sounds and delivered the message.”

“Which was?”

“He asked if I wanted to know the future. Without thinking, I said ‘sure’. Like you said earlier, Jack, why pass up that chance?”

“Great minds think alike,” I said.

“He just kept repeating the same thing. ‘No survivors.’”

“Cryptic,” I said.

“I had a flight to catch the next day. After I heard that, well, I canceled it.”

“Wait, a random voice in your mind made you cancel a plane flight? Aren’t you worried about the cost of changing plans?” Daphne asked.

“Of course,” Joe said. “Who can honestly afford that? But, like, when something weird gives you a sign, take it. My life is worth more than a plane ticket, ya know what I mean?”

“What happened to the flight?”

“Engine failure. Had to land right after takeoff. Everyone was okay, but I know in my bones if I had been on the plane, it would’ve crashed.”

Ollie started waving their hands to get my attention. I glanced down at the call screen. “Joe, hold on. We have another person who swears they saw this thing at the 7-Eleven, too. Greg? You there?”

“Bro, bro, bro, this guy is spitting the truth! This thing is always hanging out there.”

“Really?” I said, my internal bullshit detector going off. “You’ve seen this too?”

“Bro, this thing flippin’ loves taquitos.”

There it was. A crank call. I knew it was coming. We all did. “What flavor taquito?”

“Uh, ya know, regu… I love you, Emily Sanders! Flip-flop flu!” Greg said before the sound of a phone hanging up.

“Taquito flavors always trip up the weirdos,” I said.

“This isn’t a joke,” Joe spat. “This thing is real. It gets inside you and, like, hacks your brain. Sometimes, I’ll hear a voice that isn’t mine. See things that aren’t in the room. It, like, uses me now. It sees and hears through me. He’s probably using me now to get to you. To your audience.”

That thought chilled me. My week was already shitty. I didn’t need to add “becoming a ghost figure’s personal camera” to the list. I didn’t believe Joe, but the man spoke with such conviction that it gave me pause. Looking at Daphne’s face, she agreed. Cementing that opinion, she again hit the shocking music sting.

I held back my laughter. From inside their call screening room, Ollie did not. Their guffaws didn’t come across on the air, but the general feeling did.

This guy was full of it.

“Let’s hope that’s not the case,” I said. “Does he have any messages for us?”

“You don’t want me to answer that,” Joe said. “People, stay away from this thing. Don’t look at it. Don’t engage. It’s probably a dem….” The phone line went dead.

“Not at all ominous,” Daphne chimed in.

“Think that is probably a good time to take a break. You’re listening to Night Moves on AM 640,” I said, pulling my headphones off as we went to commercial. I glanced over at Daphne. “Banger to start out with, Daph. Great job finding this story.”

Ollie burst into the studio and yelled, “The lines are jammed! Apparently, our ghoul is well known and super active in the community.”

“Maybe he’s running for office. Sounds like an ideal politician,” I said. “Minus the evil stuff.”

“Actually, even with the evil stuff, he’s an ideal politician,” Daphne countered.

“South Street Wanderer 2028!” Ollie proclaimed. “We could sell T-shirts!”

Daphne stood up. As she did, her whole body shivered. She rubbed her arms, warming herself. “I won’t miss the arctic temps in the studio, that much I promise you.”

“I’m warm, actually. You really feel cold?”

“Not to break up the climate crisis in the studio, but Daphne and I were talking pre-show about, well, maybe sending me out on assignment.”

“To where?”

“We’re not that far from South Street,” Ollie said. “I could go down there. Do a man on the street segment. Assuming you wouldn’t mind handling the phones while I was gone, Daph.”

“Ollie, no matter what your position is at a radio station, you never stop answering phones,” Daphne said with a smile. “I like you heading down there. Shows moxie. Maybe you’ll catch something. Cause a sensation. Then we really can sell T-shirts.”

“Save the show,” Ollie said hopefully.

“I think the only thing that can save the show now is divine intervention,” I said, raining on the parade.

“So send young Ollie down to the street. What do we have to lose?”

“We could lose Ollie,” I said.

“Small price to pay for fame,” Daphne said. “Kidding, of course.”

“I could be radio’s own DB Cooper,” Ollie said. They turned to me. “I can handle myself, though. Trust me, when you’re in my situation, you need to know how to throw hands, Jack.”

I sighed. “I’d rather not send our lovely but eager colleague off to meet with a potential monster,” I said. “Buuuut, if Ollie is okay, I wouldn’t say no to it either.”

Ollie laughed. “Odds are, it’s a bust. I can’t imagine this thing always hanging around the 7-Eleven, right? Maybe the clerk talks about it? Or, more likely, a drunk or two might have some things to ramble on about.”

“You said to unleash the weirdos,” Daphne said. “Drunks qualify. Especially 7-Eleven drunks.”

“You come back if any of them have a message about your future or if you get a headache. Deal?”

Ollie’s face lit up. They squealed and did a little happy dance. Daphne and I laughed. Ollie was a good kid and would make an amazing radio personality one day. Why not give them a chance to add to their reel? In this economy, in this business, the next gig could be elusive. Especially to unknown talent.

“We’re back in two,” I said, glancing at the clock. “Let’s get through some of these calls and see where we are at the top of the hour. If we’re flagging, Operation Taquitos starts.”

The next hour was a mixed bag of callers - some genuine, some fake, some off their meds. The topic remained the same, though. Despite their demeanor and mental state, anyone who dealt with this thing had similar stories: they heard a voice, received an offer, and either ignored it or took it. If they agreed, their reward was a cryptic message, minor aches and pains, and really horrid vibes.

“And you say the pain just stopped?”

“Oh yeah,” another Wanderer victim said. “About a week after it happened, I didn’t feel anything.”

“Didn’t feel like another person in your head?”

“H-E double hockey sticks no,” the caller said with a laugh. “That guy’s as loony as an outhouse rat.”

Turns out, tons of people in the Valley knew about the Wanderer. This mythological monster was far more well-known than our show. A common refrain callers felt the need to add was, “Never heard your show before, but…” That was humbling.

I’d never heard of the legend before Daph had brought it to me. Apparently, I was the only person in the Valley who hadn’t, because our call volume was the heaviest it’d ever been. Way more than the nacho bomb incident of ‘23 - and that garnered local news coverage. Even with that bump, our steady audience was fleeting.

Tonight, though, it felt as if the whole town was listening.

“I guess I’m just confused about why everyone calls him the wanderer when he doesn’t seem to do too much wandering.”

“It’s because his Instagram account is all travel pictures,” Daphne said. “I’ll say this, the ghoul knows how to frame a shot.”

“Ollie says someone on Line 3 can explain the wanderer stuff. Let’s hear what a pro has to say. Cindy, line three, welcome to Night Moves. Our phone screener says you have some scholarly information about the Wanderer you’d like to share?”

“I didn’t want to go on the air, but whatever,” Cindy said. “You guys need to stop talking about this. The more attention you give it, the stronger it becomes.”

“Classic narcissist. You sure he’s not my ex?” Daph joked.

“This isn’t funny. The Wanderer seeks specific individuals it can use to spread its sickness. It knows when people talk about it. Your show is making a dangerous situation worse.”

“Sickness? Are you talking about headaches and nosebleeds?”

“Things get worse. Infinitely worse if it gets too strong,” Cindy said. “You guys have no idea what you’re doing. This thing is ancient and evil. It exists to spread misery.”

“Then it absolutely is my ex,” Daphne joked. “Doesn’t it help people avoid catastrophe, though? Can’t be all that bad.”

“That’s a trick. It tells you something bad will happen, but provides zero specifics. The previous plane crash caller is a good example of this. No survivors…of what? The guy took it to mean his flight, but if I had heard ‘no survivors’ and didn’t have a trip planned, what would that mean to me? Could be anything.”

“But the flight had engine trouble,” I said. “So the Wanderer was right.”

“No, it wasn’t. No one died on the flight.”

“What a bastard that ghoul is not killing off a plane full of people,” Daphne said. Her tone was jokey, but her face wasn’t. Daph had pretzeled her body and was leaning close to the mic. Something about this caller was getting under her skin - like this was a personal attack.

“I’ll grant you that the engine trouble was an amazing coincidence, but the message wasn’t uniquely prophetic because nothing ultimately happened. The caller was safe. The plane was safe.”

“Because the Wanderer told him it’d be. Jack, am I crazy? Cindy here doesn’t seem to be saying much of anything.”

“To a true believer like yourself, I can see that being the case.”

That was the splinter under the fingernail for Daph. She sighed, laughed, and attacked. “True believer? I just read about this the other day,” Daphne said. “I’m just not willing to dismiss it because one rando crazy bitch has a theory.”

“Whoa,” I said. “Let’s relax….”

“I’m used to true believers getting upset. It’s okay,” Cindy said. It looked like Daphne was ready to pounce. I balled up a piece of paper and threw it at her. It bounced off her console and broke her concentration. I wagged my finger at her, and she leaned back in her chair. Her claws retracted.

“Cindy, what were you saying?”

“This isn’t a theory. It’s a scientific fact. Think about it like this: let’s say something incredible happens to you - good or bad - but you don’t understand why it happened. Lacking concrete information, our brain fills in the information gaps with belief. It’s how conspiracy theories bloom.”

“You saying all our callers are conspiracy theorists?” Daphne asked.

“Or that the world isn’t flat,” I countered.

“We all can fall under the sway of good stories,” Cindy said, ignoring my joke. “That caller believes that had he gone on the plane, it would’ve crashed. How does he know that? He doesn’t. But it’s an emotional truth…and that’s enough for some of us. Actual proof requires facts. Belief requires only hope, and hope is nothing more than positive thoughts.”

“Why does the Wanderer bother with that at all?” I asked.

“It lies to gain your trust. That’s a seed planted in your mind. Some people won’t water the seed, so it never germinates. But others will. They’ll tell people about this incredible thing that happened to them. Each conversation gives the Wanderer strength. More of a hold on the person’s mind. By the time the seed blossoms, the victim’s ready to be used for the next stage,” Cindy said. “Jack, it’s called the Wanderer because its evil wanders to every mind that’s open to its message.”

“So our show is an evil super-spreader event?” Daphne asked. “What happens when it gets strong? What’s the Wanderer’s purpose?”

“Chaos. Death. Destruction. It uses its victims. Some will spread their gospel. Some will enact their violence. Some will stand aside as it happens. Each role plays a part in their evil plans.”

“Didn’t realize we had such a large contingent of evil listeners,” Daphne.

“We’re all capable of evil. You asked about its purpose. Best I can tell is that the Wanderer exists to end us all. It infects people and allows them to act on their worst impulses.”

Cindy’s words hung there for longer than I’d normally allow. What started as a fun, goofy topic had moved into a horrifying place. We were all processing this strange left turn into genuine concern. I had a bunch of other questions, but the next sound I heard was a dial tone.

Daphne hung up on Cindy. “New age woo woo kook pranking us. Probably surrounded by crystals. They’re worse than wine moms.”

“Well, Cindy, I appreciated the insight.”

“Gonna run right out and buy one of her crystals? Ward off bad juju?”

“Maybe I’ll get one for the studio. Keep the peace,” I said. Daphne’s right eyebrow raised, and she narrowed her eyes at me. I laughed. “Saturn is in retrograde, the moon is waxing gibbous, and you’re listening to Night Moves on AM640. Back in….”

The door to the studio slammed open. Daphne and I both turned to see a familiar face standing there. Manny. The bloody tissue was still wadded up in his nose. His eyes looked glazed. When he moved, he looked like a puppet on marionette strings.

“Manny? What the hell….”

“Keep going,” he said as he smiled widely. Too wide. Joker-level wide. “Keep talking.” It sounded like his voice, but it wasn’t his voice. It was flat. Monotone. Lifeless. His whole body turned toward Daphne. She clutched a pair of scissors. “Keep going.”

He coughed. The hacking unleashed two gushing streams of blood from his nostrils.

Daphne screamed. I took us to commercial and rushed over to Manny. But something in her scream must’ve snapped Manny out of his trance. His whole body relaxed…until he saw the blood streaming from his nose. He pinched the bridge and tilted his head back to staunch the flow.

“Jesus Christ and his disciples,” Manny said. “Not this again!”

“Manny, what the hell?”

Panic crossed his face. “How did I get here, dog?” he said, confused. “Why the fuck am I bleeding so much?”

The door kicked open again to reveal a pissed-off Ron. His face was red with rage. But his eyes showed fear. As soon as he saw Manny, he grabbed him by the shirt and started shaking him. Manny screamed and pushed Ron back. Before it could come to blows, I slid in between them and broke them up.

“Chill! Chill!” I yelled. They finally relaxed after exchanging a few choice words. I put my hand on Manny’s shoulder and looked him dead in the eyes. “What’s going on?”

“I dunno, bro. Last thing I remember was driving to my next stop, listening to the show. Then you were here talking to me.”

“He’s gotta go,” Ron said. “Never come back here, you hear me, boy?”

“Who the hell are you calling ‘boy’, old man?”

“Enough!” Daphne screamed. “Ron, we’ve got it handled. Go back to the office and have another smoke or ten.”

Ron looked at me. I nodded. The intrusion was unexpected, but I had a handle on it. He straightened out his shirt, ran his hand through his slick, thinning hair, and nodded to us all. He gave Manny the finger and walked out.

“Man, fuck that fool.”

“You feeling okay?” I asked. “You’re kinda freaking everyone out.”

“To be real with you? Not really. I think…I think I’m going to go home sick. I’m, ugh, I’m sorry, dog. Didn’t mean to break up the party. Show’s been fire tonight, though.” He turned to Daphne. “Sorry, Daph. I didn’t mean nothing by it. Honest.”

“Feel better, Manny,” Daphne said. She didn’t drop the scissors.

Once the studio door shut, I expected the vibe to shift. It didn’t. Doom hung in the air. Even when Ollie entered from the call screening room, everything still felt heavy. I glanced up at the clock and saw we had thirty seconds to air.

[Text saved in BoLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/s/M9bmG3V89D)

So I moved into a new neighborhood in August. Shortly after I moved in, flyers started appearing on utility poles etc, alerting the residents that a child sexual predator has moved to the neighborhood. The flyer contains a cropped screenshot of the person they are ""mistaking"" me for's entry on the sex offender registry - we do share a name, but that's it. My name is not uncommon - I'm not Joe Smith but I am not Eusebius Cadmarenious either. Either way, the person posting these is definitely aware of the fact that it's not me, as they cropped the offender's mugshot out of the screenshot and replaced it with a picture from my LinkedIn profile. I have looked up Not-Me's entry on the sex offender registry, and he's a fat white guy in his sixties. I am an average build mixed dude (who looks black) in my thirties. And to be clear, while there's no such thing as a minor sex crime, this guy is on the registry for forcible rape of a child under 13 or something along those lines.
 
I spoke to the police as soon as I found out about the flyers via my wife, which must have been a fun surprise for her to see when she was walking home from the train. They basically said ""that sucks but how do you expect us to find out who is putting them up?"" I was confronted by a neighbor yesterday; luckily I bookmarked Not-Me's sex offender registry page on my phone, and the guy who confronted me was level headed enough to immediately apologize. He knew who was putting the flyers up, gave me the guy's name and described him as ""kind of a conspiracy nut."" Great. The abundant misspellings and CAPS for EMPHASIS on the flyer should have tipped me off. Anyway, I have no interest in confronting this guy myself, because there's a very low chance of the interaction ending in any manner that involves all of his teeth remaining in his head. I called the police again, and this time their take on it is more or less ""well being wrong isn't a crime, just keep taking the flyers down when you see them and try to ignore it."" This was last night.
 
Ignoring this isn't an option. I am planning on going to the department in person today when I get back from work. Has a crime been committed here, or is my only remedy going to be civil court? I feel like this is way beyond the standard type of libel that might fuck with my ability to get a job or something, as there's a non-zero chance that this kind of bullshit could lead to a vigilante type trying something.

I've got something of a hectic day at work (otherwise I would have gone in late to get my ass to the police department earlier), so I might not respond here right away, but if any more information or clarification is needed, I'll get to it as soon as I can. Thanks in advance for the help.

The hectic day at work I mentioned in that post was about ten times worse than I expected, so I just got a chance to pull it up a few minutes ago and found it locked. I am a long time lurker and knew about this subreddit, so I was able to find this. I wanted to thank everyone for the great advice, and reply to a few things I saw.

> First off, a bunch of people mentioned potential difficulty with collecting a judgement if I go the civil route and this dude doesn't own property. The north half of my block is all apartments, most of which are rentals. The south half, where I live, is all single family houses. I don't know where the person hanging the posters lives, but I don't care about making a buck off of this. My preference is, by far, to avoid any civil litigation in favor of handling this through the police if at all possible, but if I sue this guy, I don't care about collecting. To be blunt, my wife and I both have reasonably high paying jobs, so if I were to sue this guy, it would be more about extracting a pound of flesh or forcing him to deal with a judgement hanging over his head. I know it's petty and I am not normally the vindictive type, but in this context I am perfectly content to be an asshole about it.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/pzZCDAVJKD)  **Oct 21, 2019 (3 days later)**

[Update - saved in BoLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/s/2pFk57lf8L)

This will probably come as an anticlimactic update for some people, as I won't be pursuing any sort of legal remedies to the situation, either criminal or civil. I'm gonna make up names this time around instead of describing my interactions with somebody to identify them. 
 
On Friday night I got in touch with the guy who had confronted me and backed down when I showed him the actual sex offender registry page (Joe). Turns out he's on the co-op board in the flyer guy's (Steve) building. Steve has a sister (Anne) who comes is around his apartment pretty often; Joe ran into her on Friday afternoon and told her about the situation. He asked me if I'd be willing to grab a cup of coffee with the two of them before getting the police involved. I agreed to this, and we met up on Sunday afternoon.
 
So as it turns out, Steve is actually pretty sick, well beyond anything along the lines of the standard racist conspiracy theory type. In fact racism isn't a part of it at all - he believed that I had ties to the whole Epstein situation, which to him would make it easy enough for me to change my appearance. Anne promised me to that he's nothing like this when his meds are working, and apparently they've been less than effective of late. She'd brought this up to someone involved in his treatment, and they had planned to address it, but she didn't realize just how bad things had become. I have a close family member who has an illness that has resulted in a few episodes of psychosis; he's one of the kindest, most thoughtful people I know 99% of the time, but it's been physically dangerous to be around him during his psychotic breaks, so I feel for them. 

Anyway, Steve is currently receiving inpatient treatment to get back on the right track, and will be attending a partial hospitalization program after his release to make sure that his meds remain effective. Joe wrote a letter about the situation, a copy of which is going to be delivered to each resident of his building. He's also reached out to members of the co-op boards that he knows in couple other buildings on the block, and they've agreed to do the same. Anne is going to post copies in the same locations Steve had been putting them up, and slide copies under the doors of the single family houses on my side of the block. She's genuinely incredibly apologetic, and I don't see any reason to push the issue with law enforcement or in court, provided Steve is getting adequate treatment so something like this doesn't happen again. 
 
So yeah, all things considered, while this isn't necessarily a happy ending, I'm glad this guy's getting the help he needs and that there are people who are willing to step up and help with clearing my name. All in all, the resolution has made a greater impression on me than the issue that necessitated it's development, and I feel like I picked a pretty good block to live on. 
 
Thanks again for all of the advice, and apologies to anyone who had their justice boner killed.

Frankl’s reflections, born out of unimaginable suffering, aren’t just about survival, they’re about discovering purpose when the world feels empty or uncertain.

As someone who has spent nearly ten years as a software engineer, I live in a world that often prides itself on logic and precision. 

Code compiles, or it doesn’t. Systems scale, or they crash. Yet Frankl reminded me that human life isn’t nearly so binary. There have been seasons in my career when I felt deeply fulfilled, building tools that mattered and solving problems that truly made a difference. And there have been other times when meaning seemed harder to find, when job prospects fell through, projects ended abruptly, or the future looked foggy at best.

Frankl writes that even when we can’t control our circumstances, we still hold power over how we respond. That lesson struck me in a new way this time. I realized that every late night spent debugging, every disappointing rejection, and every moment of doubt has quietly shaped me into someone who doesn’t give up easily. The meaning isn’t always obvious in the moment, but often it reveals itself in hindsight.

Right now, I’m in a period of uncertainty, reflecting on what comes next in my journey. Reading Frankl reminded me that meaning isn’t something handed to us, it’s something we build, day by day, in the way we choose to face challenges. That thought has given me a measure of peace and maybe even a bit of strength to keep moving forward.

Books like this don’t give me all the answers. But they remind me that I’m not alone in searching for them. And perhaps, in that reminder itself, there is already a kind of meaning.

Thank you sincerely to everyone who has read my thoughts all the way through. It means more than I can say to know that there are people who resonate with these words and share in these reflections.

Life will always bring us moments of struggle, but even in the darkest times we can choose not to lose courage. When I sit here with a cup of coffee, staring at my screen in the comfort of a warm room, I remind myself that somewhere in the world, someone is cold, hungry, and carrying burdens far heavier than mine.

That awareness doesn’t erase my challenges, but it grounds me. It inspires me to keep going, to live more mindfully, and to strive for a better life, not only for myself, but in a way that can bring a little light to others too.

Let’s all do our best to cultivate lives filled with resilience, compassion, and hope. Even the smallest act of courage today can become the seed of a brighter tomorrow.

Let’s start with the numbers because even Burak Yılmaz, Gaziantep’s new head coach (and former striker with a résumé that includes scoring goals and managing expectations), can’t argue with statistics.

* **Gaziantep FK (-0.5, 2.0 implied probability):** The home team is priced at **2.0** across most books, implying a **50% chance to win**. Recent form? A three-game winning streak (2-1 over Gençlerbirliği, 3-2 vs. Kasımpaşa) after a rocky start. New signings like Drissa Camara and Rob Nizet are chomping at the bit for their Süper Lig debuts.
* **Kocaelispor (+0.5, 3.5–3.9 implied probability):** The visitors are a **28–33% shot** to pull off an upset, per decimal odds. No recent meetings to analyze, but their defense? A work in progress.
* **Over/Under 2.5 Goals (1.89–1.93):** Implied probability of **53–54% for the Over**. Recent Gaziantep matches have averaged 4.5 goals per game. If this is a recipe, it’s a spicy gumbo—high on drama, low on subtlety.

**Key Takeaway:** Gaziantep’s offense is a five-star chef with fresh ingredients (new signings). Kocaelispor? They’re the “I’ll sleep when I’m dead” team, showing up to work but not necessarily nailing the coffee.

### Digest the News: Burak Yılmaz’s Coaching Debut & New Signings’ First Date

Gaziantep’s president, İsmet Taşdemir, must be smiling. After a 3-0 drubbing to Galatasaray and Konyaspor, they swapped managers and now have a **three-game winning streak** under Yılmaz. The new boss isn’t just a pretty face—he’s a former player who knows how to turn a 3-2 win into a “we’re unstoppable” narrative.

Meanwhile, Kocaelispor’s defense is like a sieve that’s been challenged to a sieve contest. They’ve allowed 2+ goals in four of their last five matches. Their best hope? Praying Gaziantep’s new signings are still finding their way to the locker room.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Göztepe vs. Kayserispor: A Tactical Tussle with a Side of Humor**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard cash: Göztepe is the favorite here, with odds hovering around **2.15** (implying a \~47% chance to win), while Kayserispor sits at **3.25-3.45** (\~29-31%). The draw? A meager **3.1-3.3** (\~30-32%). The spread favors Göztepe by a hair (-0.25), and the total goals line is set at **2.5**. Over/Under odds are tight, with “Over” priced at **1.91-1.98** (\~51-53%) and “Under” at **1.8-1.85** (\~54-55%).

Göztepe’s implied probability of winning is nearly double Kayserispor’s, which makes sense given their **8-point start** (2-0-2) and third-place standing. Kayserispor, meanwhile, is a mystery—no recent news, no standout stats, and a name that sounds like it’s begging for a coffee shop mascot.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Training Camps, and the Ghost of Ogün Bayrak**  
Göztepe’s lone pre-season injury, Ogün Bayrak, isn’t listed as a current concern, so the squad is presumably at full strength. Coach Stanimir Stoilov has been drilling passing, midfield transitions, and shooting—basically, the soccer equivalent of a spreadsheet wizard. The team’s already in Kayseri for a training camp, which is either a strategic move or an excuse to let the players acclimate to the altitude (or the local kebab scene).

Kayserispor? All we know is their name and that they’re hosting. No injuries, no transfers, no drama—just a team hoping to avoid being Göztepe’s next victim. If this were a movie, they’d be the “tough underdog” role, but with less charisma and more substitutions.

I'm returning it. In the meantime, I'm trying to get my first espresso shot pulled properly. I went to my local coffee shop and asked them to grind me a bag of beans the same way they would for their machines so it's actually fine enough. The barista did so, assuring me that she does this for their machines and knows how to set it. Before, my finest grind was still coarse enough to get 100ml out of a double shot compressed as hard as I could in 25s. Now, however, it's so fine that when I compress it with only 30-40lbs of force, one time only, it comes out barely at all and the machine isn't happy with the process. It takes a minute plus to get even 50ml.

So I need some help on how to properly tamp. I have a DeLonghi Stilosa (the model with steam/off/on/brew on the front knob, left to right). How much should I fill the portafilter for a double-shot?

Now it's September again, and every year I have to adjust from the abundant sunshine of summer to the beginning of the dark season.
My DPD is probably a symptom of chronic schizophrenia, which in recent years has shifted its focus from positive to negative symptoms. It's encouraging that the DPD has gradually improved over the past seven years. My body awareness is now normal, and my spatial vision is back. The remaining symptoms of schizophrenia manifest themselves as depressions of rapidly changing intensity. Today, while hiking, around midday, I experienced another brief phase of feelings like I was nearing the end of my life. The lighting conditions no longer brighten my mood like they did weeks ago. But then there's some hope: For a short time, coffee reliably helps end depression within minutes, as long as it works. Or it's the questioning and engagement with knowledge that releases dopamine. I have the feeling that research won't stand still, and that these depressions will be better treated in a few years.  In schizophrenia, negative symptoms are persistent. But I've had hope my whole life. The constant, small progress makes me somewhat optimistic, despite these phases.

1nggyta,https://www.reddit.com/r/news_by_coneberry/comments/1nggyta/top_tea_storage_tins_for_freshness/,Top Tea Storage Tins for Freshness,"In the world of tea, freshness is everything. The delicate flavors and aromas that tea enthusiasts cherish can easily be lost when exposed to air, light, or moisture. This makes storage solutions a critical part of preserving tea’s natural qualities. For over a decade, Dongguan Kaisi Technology Co., Ltd., better known as Kaisi Tin Box, has emerged as a trusted leader in providing [top tea storage tins for freshness](https://www.kaisitinbox.com/) designed to ensure lasting freshness.

**The Importance of Proper Tea Storage**

Tea is highly sensitive to its environment. Humidity can cause leaves to deteriorate, light can alter flavor profiles, and exposure to air can strip away essential oils. While many tea lovers experiment with jars or plastic containers, metal tea tins remain the gold standard. They combine airtight sealing, durability, and aesthetic appeal, making them the preferred choice for both casual drinkers and professional tea retailers.

**Kaisi**’**s Legacy in Tin Box Manufacturing**

Founded in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province, Kaisi Tin Box has become one of China’s most respected manufacturers of tin packaging. With over 10 years of expertise, the company specializes in industries as diverse as luxury gifts, cosmetics, food, and of course, tea and coffee packaging.

As the #1 most popular tin box supplier on [Alibaba.com](http://Alibaba.com), Kaisi has built its reputation on precision engineering, strict quality control, and a dedication to customer satisfaction. Its global certifications (FDA, SGS, and ISO) underline its commitment to international safety and quality standards.

**Why Tea Tins from Kaisi Stand Out**

Kaisi’s tea tins are more than just containers; they are carefully designed guardians of freshness. With customizable options in materials, shapes, coatings, and printing, brands can ensure their packaging is not only functional but also aligned with their identity.

Popular options include:

* Airtight Round Tea Tin Box: Perfect for locking in freshness and aroma.
* Round Tea Tin with Hinge: Convenient for daily use with a secure closure.
* Double Lid Gold Tea Can: Extra protection for premium teas.
* Custom Rectangle Metal Tea Tin Box: A modern choice for brands seeking distinction.

Each tin is designed with both preservation and presentation in mind, ensuring that tea not only tastes fresh but looks appealing on shelves or in gift sets.

**The Customization Advantage**

Unlike off-the-shelf packaging, Kaisi offers an end-to-end customization process that begins with concept design and ends with final delivery. Their streamlined approach includes one-on-one customer support, 3D design proofs, and efficient production workflows. Whether a client needs a unique mold, branded artwork, or specialty coatings, Kaisi’s professional R&D team brings ideas to life.

This flexibility has made the company a trusted partner for global businesses, from boutique tea houses to large-scale food brands.

**Global Reach and Recognition**

Kaisi Tin Box products are exported worldwide, earning recognition across diverse markets. Their ability to meet international compliance standards makes them especially attractive to businesses targeting customers in Europe, North America, and beyond. By combining traditional craftsmanship with modern manufacturing techniques, Kaisi consistently delivers products that satisfy both functional and regulatory demands.

**Why Choose Kaisi for Tea Storage Tins?**

For businesses and tea lovers alike, the reasons to choose Kaisi are compelling:

* 10+ Years Expertise: Decades of precision-engineered packaging solutions.
* End-to-End Customization: From design to delivery, every detail tailored.
* Global Certifications: FDA, SGS, and ISO compliance for peace of mind.
* Strict QC: Quality guaranteed through rigorous inspection processes.
* Factory Direct: Competitive costs and fast delivery with no middlemen.

**A Call to Action for Tea Enthusiasts and Businesses**

Tea deserves packaging that protects its essence and enhances its presentation. Kaisi Tin Box provides the perfect solution with its innovative, customizable, and globally certified tea storage tins.

Daniel woke up the next morning and forgot, for a split second, that she was gone. His hand reached instinctively across the mattress, searching for her warmth. But the sheets were cold. The kind of cold that sinks into your bones.

The apartment was too quiet. No sound of Marisol humming while making coffee, no clinking of spoons against mugs, no soft footsteps padding across the floor. Just him, the hum of the heater, and the distant city noise that felt harsher than usual.

He walked into the kitchen and saw her mug still in the sink. Lipstick smudged faintly along the rim. He picked it up and stared at it like it was a relic from another life. How could something so ordinary feel like a knife in his chest?

His phone buzzed. A text from his best friend, Javier:
“You good, bro? Heard she left.”

Daniel didn’t answer. How could he put into words the weight in his chest, the hollowness inside his ribs? He wasn’t “good.” He wasn’t even sure he was alive.

Instead, he scrolled through old photos. Marisol’s laugh frozen in time, her hand clutching his arm, her eyes that always seemed to smile before her lips did. He thought of the fights they’d had, the late nights where words turned sharp, where love turned into something heavy. But the photos never showed that. The photos lied.

By noon, he hadn’t eaten. He hadn’t showered. He just sat in the living room with the blinds half-open, watching shadows crawl across the floor.

At one point, he whispered to himself, “This can’t be real.”

But it was.
The empty side of the bed was proof.

That was Day Two. The day the world felt hollow, and the air itself seemed heavier without her in it.",1,1757820937.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1nggvc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1nggvc4/twenty_seven_miles_into_adulthood/,Twenty Seven Miles Into Adulthood,"I miss the edited, chopped up USA Network movies one would come home to on Saturday nights in the nineties. There is no mid-night Def Comedy Jam or local DJs taking requests. The remnants of our youth are the songs that local bands lament from corner bars. The scene is made up of my kid’s teachers and my older kid’s friends. I’ve never been good at seeing teachers outside of their natural environment and, even now, I just give a slight wave because they don’t want to talk to me and I don’t really want to talk to them.

The Waffle House and Denny’s are the only all night diners, carrying on the tradition of coffee, cigarettes, and conversations after midnight; but neither serve meatball-and-marinara 
topped-with-mozzarella omelets that I so crave.

I scan the shoes at the bar and when I see a pair of Doc Martens, it brings me some joy. No one cares about Brenda, Dylan, and Kelly anymore and I feel I must hide that I do enjoy Woody Allen films.

My 95 year old grandmother died this summer and I was offered the opportunity to buy everyone out for her house and return to my hometown. For all the love I have for that place and old friends, I feel that a reboot of life before 22 would be looked at the same way viewers seem to hate And Just Like That.

Alanis Morissette’s Thank U was the last song I heard on my hometown radio as I drove in my car followed by my fiancé in another and her dad in a U-Haul for the final time. Twenty seven miles into my adulthood, the song was interrupted by the static of competing radio stations as it slowly faded.  I eventually turned the radio off before the song finished and cried in silence that October of 1998.

Four kids and a divorce later, I’m in this awkward hinterland because my own daughter’s first album comes out next week. She is carrying on the dream her mom and I once had and there’s a mix of pride and jealousy in my heart as I drive to work each day. At least I do something I believe I tell myself each morning as I walk my dog, carrying his shit back to our house in a plastic bag because I’m a polite neighbor.

My life is chopped up into edits of memories like a USA Network movie on Saturday night.  I can be a comedy or drama depending on how I present things to my therapist; but really I’m just Pirandello’s One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand; or, to put it in more modern terms, Twenty One Pilot’s Blurryface.  Another man following in Pippin’s story, purposefully allowing the lead player to discard the fanfare and flames as I stand, stage lights darkening and music fading like it did on the radio station years ago. I remain on an empty stage with only body and voice and choice.

1nggu41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1nggu41/im_a_night_receptionist_at_hollow_pines_inn_hotel/,I'm a Night Receptionist at Hollow Pines Inn Hotel in Arkansas… We have 11 STRANGE RULES to follow!,"**""Have you ever walked into a place and felt like it already knew your name?""**

Not because someone said it. Not because of a name tag. But because the **walls** knew it—the floors, the air, the *vacancy sign still flickering in the window*. As if the building had been waiting for you.

And what if—just imagine—*you were warned not to answer a phone that doesn’t ring for people*, or *not to look into a mirror because it might reflect more than your own face*? Would you stay?

Yeah… I did.

And my name is Cody. I was the night receptionist for a hotel called **The Hollow Pines Inn**—a place buried so deep in the Arkansas woods it practically exists off the grid. There’s a town around it—**Maple Glade**—but calling it a town is generous. It’s one road in, one road out, no streetlights, and the kind of cell service that dies the second you say, “Hello?”

From the outside, it looks like the kind of place someone’s grandmother might run—**peeling white paint, wraparound porch with a crooked swing, and a little fountain that burbles but never flows**. Quaint. Quiet. Dead quiet.

But inside? Inside, the place watches you back.

I started my shift on a Friday night. **One night. That’s all I lasted.** And looking back… lasting even one feels like a miracle.

I showed up around 10:30 PM. Shift was 11 to 7. A man greeted me in the lobby—**Mr. Granger**, the manager. Short, stiff posture like someone carved him from oak. His eyes were this cloudy, pale blue—**the kind of eyes you see on a fish left too long on ice**. And his smile didn’t match the rest of his face. It looked... rehearsed.

“You ever work nights before, son?” he asked as he handed me a ring of heavy iron keys. No electronic fobs, no codes—just iron.

“Not really,” I said. “But I don’t mind the hours.”

He gave me this slow nod, then gestured toward the front desk. “Everything you need’s there. Coffee in the back. Cot if you get tired. And no check-ins after midnight.”

I forced a laugh. “Easy enough.”

He didn’t laugh back. He didn’t even blink. Instead, he reached into the drawer behind the desk and pulled out something thick and glossy—**a laminated sheet**, yellowing at the corners. Eleven rules. Printed in bold, black, government-type font. The last one? **Double bold. All caps.** Like it was the only one that really mattered.

**The Rules of The Hollow Pines Inn – Night Shift**

1. **Lock the front doors at exactly 11:01 PM.** Not a minute before. Not a minute after.  
2. **If the lobby phone rings and there’s no one in the lobby, do NOT answer it.**  
3. **If a guest named “Mr. Black” asks for a room, tell him we are full—even if we are not.**  
4. **Between 2:13 AM and 2:27 AM, you may hear a baby crying from Room 204. Do NOT go up there. No one is in that room.**  
5. **If you see a woman in a green dress staring through the front window, do NOT make eye contact. Turn off the lobby lights until she leaves.**  
6. **The mirror in the hallway by Room 108 will show things that aren’t there. Avoid looking at it after 3 AM.**  
7. **Never go into Room 103. It is always vacant. It must stay that way.**  
8. **If the power goes out, don’t panic. Stay behind the front desk and keep your eyes on the service bell. If it rings, someone is trying to come through.**  
9. **At exactly 4:44 AM, you may hear someone whisper your name. Do not respond. Even if it sounds like your mother.**  
10. **Do not, under any circumstance, take the elevator between 1:30 AM and 2:00 AM.**  
11. **If you break a rule, apologize out loud. Say:** ***“I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.”*** **Then pray it’s enough.**  

I remember staring at that list and thinking it was a joke. Some twisted hazing ritual for new employees. But Mr. Granger wasn’t joking. He never cracked a grin, never explained a thing. Just handed it to me like it was the **Ten Commandments**, then left without another word.

At 11:01 sharp, I turned the bolt on the front doors. And as the **click echoed through the empty lobby**, it felt… final. Like the building had just *inhaled* me.

That was the last moment things felt normal.

What happened next? Well… it wasn’t one big event. It was a **slow unraveling of reality**—a string of impossible moments stitched together by fear, and every rule I *almost* broke.

Because some rules? They're written for legal safety. But **these**... These were **written in blood and survival**.

Want to know what I saw when the lights flickered at 1:42 AM? Or who called the lobby phone even though the line had been dead for years?

Then stay tuned—because once you start this story…You’re already inside The Hollow Pines Inn.

And it’s already watching you.

I chuckled—nervously, mostly—and held up the laminated sheet like it was a script from a prank show. “Is this some kind of weird initiation?” I asked, half expecting a camera crew to pop out from behind the vending machine.

But Mr. Granger didn’t flinch. Didn’t smirk. Didn’t say a word, really.

He just gave me a hard stare and muttered, **“Good luck.”**

And then he left.

No goodbyes. No instructions. No car keys.

He walked right out the front door and disappeared into the woods—**on foot.** No flashlight. No coat. Just **vanished** into the black pines like he belonged to them.

I stood there, staring at the door, wondering what kind of place I’d just signed up for. I didn’t know it then, but **that was my first mistake—watching him leave instead of watching the clock.**

At exactly **11:00 PM**, I stood up, walked to the front doors, and waited.

**One minute passed.**

Tick. Tick. Tick.

**11:01.**

I twisted the deadbolt until it clicked. The sound echoed—loud, final, almost like locking a cage.

I stood there for a moment. Listening. The hotel was silent—eerily so. No cars outside. No wind. Just the soft hum of the old overhead lights.

Nothing happened.

So I breathed out, sat down behind the desk, and flicked on the dusty TV mounted in the corner. Static buzzed for a second before settling on a local news channel where nothing important was happening—just weather maps and somebody’s tractor accident.

It was peaceful. **Too peaceful.**

The next hour passed uneventfully. Two guests came down in slippers, yawning, asking about snacks. I helped them get some candy from the jammed vending machine, made a joke about it eating dollars, and sent them back upstairs.

If anything, the place just felt… old. Empty. A little sad. But safe.

That changed at **12:43 AM.**

The phone on the desk rang.

Not a cell. Not the back office. **The lobby phone.**

That old beige landline with the spiral cord and stick-on number tag. It buzzed against the wood like it was vibrating from inside the desk itself.

I looked around instinctively. The lobby was completely empty. Not a single soul in sight. No footsteps. No voices. No guests wandering down for late-night coffee.

And that’s when it hit me. **Rule #2.**

*If the lobby phone rings and there’s no one in the lobby, do NOT answer it.*

I froze.

There’s a strange kind of fear that sits just behind your ribs—a cold, squeezing pressure. That’s what I felt right then. It crept in like smoke under a locked door.

I should have let it ring.

I really should’ve.

But curiosity—**that devil wearing a friendly face**—got the better of me.

“It’s just a phone call,” I whispered. “What’s the worst that could happen?”

And I picked it up.

“**Hollow Pines Inn, front desk.**”

Silence. Not just on the line—**in everything.**

The room seemed to go still. The air stopped moving. Even the buzzing light overhead quieted like it was holding its breath.

“Hello?” I said again, softer.

Then I heard it.

Not a voice. Not even a whisper.

**Breathing.**

Wet. Ragged. As if someone was gasping through phlegm, each inhale bubbling like it came from a flooded lung.

But the worst part? It wasn’t coming through the earpiece.

**It was coming from beneath the desk.**

Right beneath me.

My throat constricted as I forced myself to clean it, stumbling back with the phone still clutched in my hand. I dropped it—let it smack hard against the wood—and stared under the desk.

Nothing.

No one.

Just shadows and wires and a faint, sour smell that hadn’t been there before.

The line clicked dead.

I’d broken the rule.

And suddenly, I remembered #11.

*If you break a rule, apologize out loud. Say: ""I acknowledge my mistake. It won't happen again."" Then pray it's enough.*

I didn’t wait.

My voice came out dry and cracked.

“**I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.**”

The lobby stayed still. No lights flickered. No breathing returned. No phantom figures crawled out of the darkness.

But something had shifted.

**The air pressed in around me—thicker, heavier, charged like the atmosphere right before a lightning strike.**

And deep inside the building, I swear—I swear—I heard a door click open.

Somewhere I hadn't touched.

**At exactly 1:10 AM**, the front doors—**the ones I had locked without fail at 11:01**—suddenly **shuddered** like something massive had thrown its weight against them.

I looked up.

There he was.

A man—if you could call him that—**tall, gaunt, and motionless**, standing just inches from the glass. His coat was black, long, too heavy-looking for someone with such a narrow frame. His skin looked... wrong. **Too pale. Almost blue. Like snow packed over dead flesh.**

And his face?

No eyebrows. No hair. Just two coal-dark eyes and a mouth that moved slowly.

He didn’t knock. Didn’t speak.

He only **mouthed the words**: **""Room, please.""**

My throat dried out instantly. My fingers found the laminated rule sheet and gripped it like a lifeline. Rule #3 burned in my mind:

*If a guest named ""Mr. Black"" asks for a room, tell him we are full, even if we are not.*

I reached for the desk mic, hand trembling. The air felt sharp now—**like it had grown teeth**.

I pressed the button. My voice came out too soft at first. I cleared it—forced it—and tried again.

“**Sorry, sir. We’re full tonight.**”

The man didn’t move.

He just tilted his head—*just slightly*—and smiled. A **tight, crooked, sliver of a smile**, like someone learning how to do it for the first time.

Then, without turning, he walked away. **Backwards.**

Not shuffled. Not stumbled.

**Walked backward**—clean, steady steps—**into the darkness**, swallowed by the treeline like he belonged to the woods.

I sat frozen, eyes locked on the now-empty doorway. I don’t know how long I stared before a sound yanked me back to reality.

**Ding.**

The elevator.

**I hadn’t touched it.** No one had.

But the doors slid open all the same—**slow, mechanical, and perfectly on time.**

I looked at the clock.

**1:29 AM.**

And my blood went cold.

*Rule #10: Do not, under any circumstance, take the elevator between 1:30 AM and 2:00 AM.*

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. I just stared as the doors hung open, revealing nothing but a flickering light and an empty floor.

For a moment, I thought that was it. That the elevator would close and I could forget it ever happened.

But at **1:34**, she stepped out.

**A woman**.

Long black hair hanging down in soaked strands like seaweed. Skin pale like parchment. She wore a thin dress, like something meant for a hospital bed, and her eyes—**God, her eyes—were too wide, too alert, stretched open like they were stuck that way.**

She never looked at me.

She simply walked across the lobby, silent, bare feet touching down like feathers, and vanished into the hallway toward the guest rooms.

No footsteps. No sound at all. Like she floated more than walked.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even dare blink. Because something in my bones told me that if I did, she’d stop. And turn. And look.

At **2:13 AM**, the next horror arrived—not through the door or the elevator, but **through the walls**.

It started soft.

A baby crying.

High-pitched. Muffled. Like it was buried behind drywall.

At first, I thought it might be a guest—maybe someone left a baby monitor on too loud.

But the sound grew sharper. Angrier.

**More desperate.**

I checked the guest ledger.

**Room 204 was empty.**

And that’s when the rule came back to me—sharp and cold like a nail driven into the back of my skull.

*Between 2:13 and 2:27 AM, you may hear a baby crying from Room 204. Do NOT go up there. No one is in that room.*

I gripped the desk. My nails dug into the wood.

Still, part of me—**some part wired wrong by empathy or madness**—wanted to help. To run upstairs and pound on that door. To hold something. Save something.

But I didn’t move.

Because this wasn’t a child. This was a **trap**.

And the crying—**God help me**—it got worse.

By 2:20, it had morphed into **a shriek**. Like the baby was being pulled apart, each wail sharper than the last, turning into something not human at all.

My ears rang. My eyes stung. I felt the tears trying to come but I blinked them back. Because whatever that thing was, it *wanted* me emotional. It *wanted* me soft.

But I sat still.

Stiffer than a corpse.

And then—**at exactly 2:27**—

**Silence.**

Like someone flipped a switch. Not even an echo remained.

And that silence?

It wasn’t comforting.

It was **watching me.**

Waiting.

Because The Hollow Pines Inn… it hadn’t finished yet.

Not even close.

I was just starting to breathe again—just letting the tension slip from my shoulders— **when the lights died.**

No flicker. No warning.

Just a **hard snap into total darkness**— the kind of dark that feels alive.

I couldn’t see my hands. Couldn’t see the desk. Couldn’t see anything.

Just **black—absolute and suffocating.**

But I remembered.

*Rule 8: If the power goes out, don’t panic. Stay behind the front desk and keep your eyes on the service bell. If it rings, someone is trying to come through.*

So I didn’t move.

Not a muscle.

I kept my back straight, eyes wide, locked on where the bell sat—**even though I couldn’t see it**, I stared like I could. Like it would protect me if I just believed hard enough.

And then it rang.

**One clear ding.**

Sharp. Piercing. **Right in front of me.**

I froze.

And then—something **brushed against my legs.**

Not a hand. Not fur. Just a presence. Like a current of air that was too thick, too *intentional*, passing under the desk and around my knees.

I gripped the desk so tight my knuckles cracked.

And though I hadn’t broken any rule—not this time—**I whispered anyway**:

“I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.”

Because in this place? **Hesitation might as well be guilt.**

At **3:02 AM**, the lights snapped back on. Just like that.

No sound. No whir. Just *light*.

But nothing was where it had been.

The air felt… different. Like it had shifted dimensions while I was trapped in the dark.

At **3:05 AM**, I made a decision. I had to use the bathroom. My bladder didn’t care about ghosts.

I took the back hallway, keeping my eyes low, fast-walked in and out.

But on the way back—**I passed the mirror by Room 108.**

And like an idiot… I looked.

*Rule 6: The mirror in the hallway by Room 108 will show things that aren’t there. Avoid looking at it after 3 AM.*

In the reflection, I saw myself.

Standing perfectly still.

And behind me?

**A man.**

Tall. Unmoving. Face long and gray.

**No eyes.** Just smooth skin stretched over bone, like something unfinished. His mouth hung half open, as if he’d been caught mid-breath.

He was leaning over me. Hand raised. About to touch my shoulder.

I spun.

The hallway was empty.

But the mirror?

Still showed him.

**Still reaching.**

I ran—**sprinted**—back to the front desk, heart pounding like it was trying to crack my ribs from the inside.

And once again, I whispered the line.

“I acknowledge my mistake. It won’t happen again.”

Even though I knew it would.

At **3:59 AM**, she came.

**The woman in the green dress.**

The one I had hoped wasn’t real.

She appeared in the front window without a sound—like she had risen straight from the ground. Her hair hung in **wet ropes**, soaked through. Her skin was too pale, **pruned and water-logged**, like she’d walked out of a lake that didn’t want her anymore.

And her eyes? **Empty. Bulging. Too wide.**

She stared directly through the glass. **Didn’t blink. Didn’t move.**

Just watched me.

And I knew—if I looked back too long, she’d find her way inside.

I dove under the desk, reached up with shaking fingers, and **killed every light in the lobby.**

Click. Click. Click.

Darkness again.

When I dared to look back toward the window—**she was gone.**

But she hadn’t walked away.

She had vanished. Like steam. Or a memory.

And then… came the voice.

At **4:44 AM**, it floated through the hallway like fog slipping through cracks in the foundation.

“**Cody?**”

A woman’s voice. Gentle. Familiar. **My mother’s voice.**

“Cody, sweetheart. Are you there?” Soft. Sweet. Desperate.

Every instinct in me screamed to answer. I nearly stood.

“Cody, it’s Mom. Please… I need help.”

But I didn’t speak. Didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.

I squeezed my eyes shut and **clamped my hands over my ears**.

I knew better.

*Rule 9: At exactly 4:44 AM, you may hear someone whisper your name. Do not respond. Even if it sounds like your mother.*

And it sounded *exactly* like her.

Too exact. Too perfect.

Like something wearing her voice as a mask.

I sat there for what felt like forever.

Until the voice faded.

Gone like fog under sunlight.

But it left something behind.

A feeling.

Like a hook still buried just under the skin.

Like the building wasn’t trying to scare me anymore—**it was trying to learn me. Mimic me. Break me.**

And I still had **hours left** before the sun would rise.

**5:50 AM.**

The clock ticked forward like it was crawling through molasses.

Ten minutes until sunrise.

I’d made it.

I’d followed every rule. Held my breath through every moment. Whispered the line more times than I could count.

For the first time all night, I started to relax.

**That was my last mistake.**

Because the elevator dinged.

Again.

The doors parted with a hiss, and out stepped a boy—**no older than ten**, dressed in soft blue pajamas, blinking like he’d just woken from a nap.

His hair was messy. His face round, unthreatening. Lost.

“Hey,” I called gently. “You okay?”

He nodded. His voice was small, polite. “Can you help me find my room?”

“Sure, what number is it?”

He smiled slightly. **“One-oh-three.”**

Everything inside me locked up. My legs rooted to the floor.

*Rule 7: Never go into Room 103. It is always vacant. It must stay that way.*

I took a step back, palms raised. “Sorry, kid. No one stays in that room.”

His face twitched. Confusion at first. Then something darker moved across it like a **shadow crawling beneath his skin**.

His eyes turned black. Not just dark—**black**, like ink spilled across a page.

His mouth stretched, too wide for his face, tearing at the corners.

And then—he whispered.

“**You answered the phone.**”

The lights died again.

**Darkness fell like a hammer.**

And the bell rang.

**DING.**

The sound sliced through the dark like a scream underwater.

I panicked—**genuinely lost it.** I didn’t whisper this time. I **yelled it.**

“I ACKNOWLEDGE MY MISTAKE! IT WON’T HAPPEN AGAIN!”

But the dark didn’t care.

Because this time… it wanted me to scream.

And then—

**everything went black.**

I woke up hours later, lying on the thin cot behind the desk.

**Sunlight poured in through the windows.**

Golden. Gentle. Unnatural in its calm.

Mr. Granger stood over me. Same stiff posture. Same cold blue eyes.

“You made it,” he said, like he was commenting on the weather.

My throat felt raw. My skin was ice.

I sat up slowly. “What the hell is this place?”

He didn’t answer the question.

He just handed me a check.

“You made it. That’s what matters.” He paused. Tilted his head. “Most don’t.”

That was all.

I didn’t ask anything else.

**Didn’t want to know.**

I stood. Walked out through the same doors he once disappeared through.

And I never—**never**—went back.

But sometimes…

**Late at night…** When everything’s quiet… When the wind stops and the house creaks and the phone charger hums—

I swear I hear it.

**That baby crying.**

Somewhere faint. Far away.

But getting closer.

And I don’t pick up the phone.

1nggsf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/VWIDBuzz/comments/1nggsf2/its_so_popular/,It’s. So. Popular.,"VW better not sleep on this car. I just spent the day driving back from a week in a lovely little cottage town with this Buzz. 

The amount of people who were coming up to me and asking about the car was insane. Literally every coffee shop, every restaurant, or even just popping into a store while the Buzz was charging. 

I’m not gonna lie, it felt Iike the car was a mini celebrity. 

I’ve caught people taking photos of it, posing with my car, or just trying to take a peek in the windows to look at the interior when I am walking to it… can’t even imagine what happens when I’m not actually there lol.

When I was charging, I had a family come up and a grandpa was like ‘oh I had a VW Bus when I was a kid! This is amazing, mine was red and white’ and how he had a camper bed in it. 

He was ecstatic when I told him you could still do it with this!

My family didn’t realize I was driving this because I hadn’t told them I bought it, and it was parked in a lot a bit away from our lodging. When we went into town I asked if anyone wanted to drive with me and got 5 others. 

They LOST THEIR MINDS when they say it… thought it was the coolest car ever. I’m just driving to our restaurant and I hear them taking selfies, playing with everything, and acting like kids.

Speaking of… We went to a provincial park for a picnic and my little nieces and nephews (5,7,9) were using this Buzz as their personal playhouse - eating in it, napping, chilling, goofing around. They just naturally gravitated towards the colourful ‘cool’ car. 

I have *never* seen people act this way about a car before. I really hope VW understand how absolutely *bonkers* popular this car could be. It has cult popularity already.

We went to a provincial park for a picnic and my little nieces and nephews (5,7,9) were using this Buzz as their personal playhouse - eating in it, napping, chilling, goofing around. 

If VW maybe made a version that was a majorly parsed down in features version below $50,000, or even $40,000 - you’d have people breaking into the dealerships. 

I guess I need to ask a question for the flair - Has anyone else had such a positive response to this car? I absolutely love how in love people are with it. ",11,1757820639.0,VWIDBuzz,6,1.0,False

I promised I would share photos once it was over. It’s been almost a year, but I’m finally sharing how things went along with photos. Feel free to skip the text to enjoy the photos. I just thought would be fun to include details. Enjoy!

I did the best I could to create some LIS ambience in our little apartment. I printed a crap ton of Rachel Amber missing posters, used some leftover photo paper to print off the photos from the game, and I printed other paraphernalia. I also purchased some decals from SunnyGoOfficial on Etsy. Our apartment was covered in LIS stuff. The maintenance guy was probably a little confused when he came by a few days before the party.

I created a YouTube playlist that included videos from the official LIS YouTube playlist of moments of calm as well as the rest of the music in the game (minus the music from the Vortex Club party because that wasn’t the vibe) as well as the trailers for the original game and DE. The music played in the background during the party.

The party itself was so fun! We had a little “Two Whales Cafe” where my husband dressed up as the barista. He was so sweet—he even looked up how to make coffee drinks and designed and made the “all is whale” shirt. You’ll see a card he made up for people to order their drinks with. One friend got me an ice cream cake that looked like a stack of pancakes! It was so cool.

We played one of those murder mystery boxes that I think was a great activity for everyone. I had gotten a Polaroid Now+ for my birthday so I gave everyone a photo as a their party favor.

I was even able to get some friends to cosplay with me. I dressed up as Max, of course. You can guess the other characters!

I included a photo outside because I think it’s cool my LIS party started during the Golden Hour.",6,1757820575.0,lifeisstrange,1,1.0,False

1nggpx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/downsyndrome/comments/1nggpx8/my_positive_experience_7mo_in/,My positive experience - 7mo in,"Hi everyone, this is my deeply personal experience, I understand it is unique to me but I would like to share because I wish I could have told myself 7months ago how well it all works out. 

My daughter had an at birth Down Syndrome diagnosis.

I personally am so thankful the experience of realizing my daughter had Down syndrome was linked to the moment they laid her on my chest, maybe the extreme rush of dopamine and endorphins from just having my baby and seeing her, completely softened the shock? Because I remember looking at her and just thinking oh, wow, I think my baby has Down syndrome. I didn’t really know how to ask and if everyone would think I was NUTS if she actually didn’t lol. But when the Dr walked in and started to say she had some physical characteristics I just nodded and said yes I noticed. It was peaceful. I was nervous of the unknown but I just couldn’t believe I was holding my beautiful baby and Down syndrome came second to the fact I had a newborn!! She was tiny and so cute and I was so freaking proud and in love. I told my husband “she came to the right family.” I felt so thankful I was chosen to be her mom.

The crash out came about 6 hours after birth. I had now not slept in 36 hrs and suddenly everything was scary. The first major trigger was I got on the internet. Worst case scenario seemed to be everywhere I looked and my entire world and perspective tilted. I began to be scared for her health. I was scared of how people would react. I was scared to tell my family and friends and scared of who would let me down and disappoint me by how they would now view my baby. I was scared of the first time someone would say something hurtful. I was scared of what this would mean for my toddler. I was scared of doctors putting her in a box and generalizing her. I was scared to make the wrong choices for her medically. I was scared of outliving my child. I was feeling completely overwhelmed and for the first time pure PANICK took over. I cried. I doubted myself as her mom. It was one of the most helpless moments of my life. Just writing it makes me sick, I want to go throw my arms around that new mom and hug her and tell her it is going to be ok!! Better than ok!! It’s going to be incredible. So maybe if someone reads this pregnant, or with a fresh newborn in the hospital bassinet next to them, and you are trying to keep your world from tilting so violently you get thrown off- I want to give you an ounce of hope. They are just your sweet baby, you are their mom(or dad!) and trust me, it all clicks. 

I picked up my baby and traced my finger down her little flat nasal bridge and wondered what was about to happen to my life. 

Here’s how things have gone. 

I was told babies with Down Syndrome don’t nurse effectively because of their low tone. She took to nursing right away. 
She went from 2nd percentile, to 10th, her pediatrician is an angel and her biggest fan. She CRIED! now she’s 65th on the standard child’s growth chart. That appointment- we LAUGHED. Yall my baby that “wouldn’t be able to feed effectively” was literally ABOVE AVERAGE exclusively nursing at her 6 month appointment. I was told in the hospital to expect delays on all milestones- she was rolling early, sitting unassisted by 6 months, most of her milestones she has reached earlier than her older sister did. Every. Single. Milestone- on time. She is 7 months now and gets up on hands and knees to crawl, she feeds herself, drinks out of a straw cup at meals, she LAUGHS and babbles and plays and has loved starting solids, she like to throw her spoon at you if you don’t feed her fast enough, her favorite toy is a plastic hanger (and boy will she beat you with it) I wish I could tell my earlier self  how most days we forget all about Down syndrome, because we just see our daughter. Not in the denial kind of way, but because it’s silly how much more alike she is to every other baby than she is different. Her personality is hilarious. Her joy is infectious. 

But since I remember wondering, you probably are too. So here is a list of what I notice is different -

in the early weeks the hypotonia made her feel like you were holding a puddle. I did anxiously think at any moment she would just melt through my hands lol! This made for an extremely cuddly baby, but nursing positions were a learning experience. I found side lying to be the winner. Now she is sturdy and balanced and rides the hip like any confident baby- grabby hands flying at everything. 
Playing airplane really helped encourage her core strength. She has the typical short little legs and the tiniest feet, so she’s kinda a pain to find footie Jammie’s that fit her, which means I’m stuck cutting the feet off of her sisters hand me down footies. 

The increased risk of leukemia gives me anxiety on random nights. That part sucks. I have cried over her shorter life expectancy. The flip side is she’s taught us to live our lives more fully. None of us are promised a long life. 

She has made me realize perspective is everything. The questions I stressed about are silly to me now, “do you worry she is going to live with you forever?” If that is what she wants and what works best for her I will be totally happy! Coffee with my baby girl on the front porch when im 80 and she’s 50?! A dream! My husband knocking on her bedroom door when she’s 35 asking if she wants to jump in on a late night donut run because I said I’d pass? Helloooo does it get any better? I potentially get to spend more years with my daughter having the childlike innocence we all MOURN the loss of in our typical kids? Count that as a win. You are telling me there’s a CHANCE her daddy gets to play Santa til he’s 85?!? And we’re supposed to be sad about that? Sure we instantly reworked our finances and called about life insurance on us and started making different life choices- we no longer drink alcohol, we eat better, we want to live longer for both of our girls and we’re so thankful Down Syndrome gave us better perspective on what’s important. Another thing is yes we have lost friends. I didn’t anticipate how incredible having a child with Down syndrome is at re organizing your circle because it DOES weed out the bad and brings forth the absolute BEST purest people. Our lives have gotten so much better with her. 

Thank you if you read all of this. I’m not sure why I felt so passionate about making this post randomly tonight, I can just guess it’s meant for someone. You will be ok, you will be more than ok. You will wake up one day and think wow I used to be sad? I used to be scared? Of the best thing that ever happened to me? ",5,1757820418.0,downsyndrome,0,1.0,False

1nggowe,https://i.redd.it/y5bp10abu1pf1.jpeg,New to espresso – excited to try Two Brothers beans! Would love advice or feedback.,"Hey everyone! I’m pretty new to the espresso world and wanted to share a bit of my journey so far, especially as I’m about to try my first bag of freshly roasted whole beans.

I got started when I found a well-maintained Breville Duo Temp Pro on Marketplace for $120—couldn’t pass that up. I’ve been using an Indian blend called Cothas with the dual-wall pressurized basket, and honestly, I’ve been loving every shot. It’s been a great intro.

I did try pulling shots with some Blk & Bold beans my work sent last holiday season, but they turned out super sour and unpleasant. I chalked it up to the beans being a year old and using a blade grinder that I normally use for spices (rookie mistake, I know).

After diving into this subreddit and watching a bunch of coffee YouTube content, I realized how important fresh beans and a good grinder are. So I ordered the Shardor 48mm burr grinder from Amazon—it’s arriving tomorrow! For beans, I wanted something with chocolate, caramel, and nutty notes, since that’s what I’ve enjoyed so far.

First surprise: fresh roasted beans are pricey. As someone who grew up drinking South Indian filter coffee, I had no idea coffee had so many flavor notes. In my family, we have a saying: “You can drink any tea, even if it’s badly made—but coffee has to be done well.” So I’ve always had a low tolerance for mediocre brews.

I visited a few roasters around Chicago and saw 10–12oz bags going for ~$20. But today at Costco, I spotted 2lb bags from a local roaster—Two Brothers—for the same price. Even better, the roast dates were super fresh (9/8 for a 9/13 purchase). They had two options: Sweet Home Chicago (roasted 8/26) and Montage (roasted 9/8). I went with Montage for my first true whole bean experience.

Has anyone tried these Two Brothers beans before? Would love to hear your thoughts or any tips on how to try them!

1nggo8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruckus/comments/1nggo8o/a_little_disappointed_with_speed/,A little disappointed with speed,"Hey everyone. I recently joined the ruckus community when I bought a 2012 ruckus with 7.4k miles for $900. I’ve since discovered the previous owner put on an ncy cdi, polini variator, and 5.5g dr pulley sliders, so it seems like a pretty good deal.

However, my speed on this thing feels a little lower compared to other people and I’m not sure if I just have false expectations or if something needs to be tuned. In addition to the previous owners mods, i’ve done an airbox delete and put on the psp carbon tip exhaust(it seems like it performs similarly to yoshimura at a fraction of the price, as far as I can see.)

Flat ground I’m only getting around 40mph. Fastest I’ve gone is 48 down a pretty steep hill. I feel like my flat ground should be higher atleast. I only weigh 125lbs. I’m thinking maybe I should lighten the weights because my flat ground is just above 8000rpm(probably like 8100 or 8200, kind of hard to tell exactly because i have an analog tach. i think it looks better.) Going down hills I touch 9000.

I’m also wondering if maybe I need to run a bit richer jets. i have an 85 jet with it right now and i did a spark plug chop test where you go wot for a minute and then just cut the engine. The tip was like a light grey with some ‘coffee brown’ spots on it. I’ve read it should be that color all the way around.

I honestly don’t really know too much about mechanical stuff, but working on this little 49cc GET engine has taught me so much and that’s the most fun thing about it to me. It feels like a really great first project.

Any direction or input on this would be appreciated. Maybe the engine is just a little too old(its around 8500k miles now), maybe I just have false expectations, or maybe I’m overlooking something simple. Thanks guys",1,1757820264.0,Ruckus,1,1.0,False

So the last meal i had was around 2 days ago(the last time I ate something was on a friday evening, it's a Sunday morning rn and I haven't eaten much since yesterday)

I had 100ml of coffee yesterday morning, 30 gms of spinach and lentil for lunch and 150 ml of lemon water and I had tea and a few almond pieces later on(I was fucking starving) and I was really hungry during the night, so I had 2 spoons of unsweetened peanut butter (my goal was to limit the amount of carbs and increase my protein level, so that my body starts eating up the excess fat )

And when I woke up tdy morning, i had a little bit of pain in my calfs for a very short period of time 

Chatgpt warned me that my body might be synthesizing my muscles for energy instead of fat, and I am not very hungry rn(compared to yesterday atleast)

So what should I do now, should I continue this method and wait until my body hits ketosis (in the video it took around 2-3 days iirc)

So guess what? I just stumbled upon something that’s blowing my mind – **faceless growth actually WORKS!** Like, for real. But here’s the kicker: **many of us are missing a key ingredient** that could seriously turbocharge our results. 🚀

Trust me, I get it. We’ve all been there, pouring our souls into content creation. *You know,* the hustle where you’re putting your name on the line, pouring hours into every detail… and yet, it feels like you’re spinning your wheels! 😩

But here’s the cool part: faceless content is becoming a game changer. You can grow your brand, reach more people, and do it all while staying behind the scenes. 

**Here’s what I’ve learned (and maybe you need to hear this too):**

1. **Content Over Identity:** People are looking for value, not just a name. Think about it – we gravitate towards helpful info, not who’s delivering it. 
2. **Anonymity Can Amplify Freedom:** When you’re faceless, you have the freedom to experiment without the pressure of your personal brand being on the line. Who doesn’t love the chance to get creative without the fear of judgment?
3. **Simplicity is Key:** Stop trying to overcomplicate things. Keep your content simple and focused. Faceless growth works best when you deliver actionable value without fluff.
4. **Get the Right Tools:** If you haven’t checked out this helpful guide [Maximize Me](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/), you’re really missing out! It’s like the secret sauce to speeding up your success while staying behind the curtain.

**But here’s the catch:** Are you really embracing the faceless approach? 🤔 Because, honestly, many of us are still caught in the trap of thinking we must show our faces to get things done. Let’s face it, (pun intended), it can be intimidating! But remember, you don’t need to shine in the spotlight to make an impact. 🌟

Imagine waking up, sipping your coffee, and realizing your content is resonating with people without them even knowing *you* – talk about a flex!

**Here’s a funny little thought:** What if you really started using your anonymity to your advantage? Could you take that signature creativity and put it out there without the baggage? What’s stopping you? 

Let’s keep the conversation going! What are your thoughts on faceless content? Have you given it a try, or are you still stuck on being the face of your brand? Share those stories, friends! 🎙️✨",1,1757819628.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brann vs. Vålerenga: A Soap Opera of Bicycle Kicks, Red Cards, and Existential Crises**

In a match that could only be described as *Norwegian Wood* meets *Goal!*, SK Brann edged Vålerenga 3-2 in a September 13 thriller that left fans questioning their life choices, their team’s tactics, and whether Henrik Bjørdal’s red card was a crime or a mercy killing. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Norwegian tax auditor and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many *lefse* sandwiches.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Statistical Deep Dive

Brann’s 3-2 win moved them to third in the Eliteserien, eight points ahead of Bodø/Glimt and five ahead of Viking. Vålerenga, meanwhile, remain seventh, statistically closer to a mid-table rock band than a title contender. The key stat? Brann’s 30-point lead over Bodø/Glimt is roughly equivalent to the number of times Vålerenga’s defense has said “no” this season.

Felix Horn Myhre, celebrating his 150th appearance for Brann, scored the game-tying “brassespark” (bicycle kick) in the 56th minute—a goal so spectacular it could be added to the Norwegian UNESCO World Heritage List. Ulrik Mathisen, who later notched his first league goal of the season, claimed the assist, which is statistically less impressive than claiming a free coffee at a gas station, but more impressive than Vålerenga’s entire offensive output.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Quotes, and Red Cards

Let’s start with the drama. Horn Myhre, who’s been linked to Bodø/Glimt, scored his 150th Brann goal while presumably thinking, *“I’ll stay loyal… for now. Just don’t expect me to clean my room.”* His post-match quote—“Jeg vet ikke om jeg har godt av å se denne på nytt igjen altfor mange ganger, men dette var deilig” (“I don’t know if I’d want to watch this again too many times, but it was nice”)—is the Norwegian equivalent of a sports philosopher.

Vålerenga’s lone highlight? Filip Thorvaldsen’s goal, assisted by Elias Sørensen. But their hopes crumbled when Henrik Bjørdal was sent off in stoppage time for a high kick that would’ve made a WWE wrestler blush. The red card was so dramatic, it could’ve been a plot twist in *The Sopranos*.

---

### Humorous Spin: Absurdity Meets Analysis

Brann’s defense looked like a group of penguins trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube—clumsy, but ultimately effective. Goalkeeper Oscar Hedvall made “several key saves,” which is code for “he prevented Vålerenga from scoring more than 2 goals, which is basically a miracle.”

Vålerenga’s offense, on the other hand, was like a Norwegian *smørbrød* (open-faced sandwich): ambitious in theory, but lacking in execution. Their 2-1 goal from Vegar Eggen Hedenstad was their only bright spot, but even that was overshadowed by Bjørdal’s red card. If Vålerenga’s strategy was a movie, it’d be titled *The Hangover: Part III*—chaotic, forgettable, and ending with someone’s passport getting stolen.

---

### Prediction: The Verdict

While this match is already in the books, let’s project forward. If Brann and Vålerenga meet again, bet on Brann to win *unless* Vålerenga’s players start tying their shoelaces before kickoff (a lesson they clearly didn’t learn from Bjørdal’s red card). Brann’s depth, with Horn Myhre’s flair and Mathisen’s newfound scoring touch, makes them the statistical favorite. Vålerenga? They’ll need to trade their “soap opera” energy for a playbook and maybe a better offside trap.

In the end, Brann’s 3-2 win was as chaotic as a IKEA assembly line but just as satisfying when you finally figure out where the Allen wrench went. As Horn Myhre would say: *“Deilig, but don’t ask me to watch it again.”*

**Final Verdict**: Brann wins the narrative, the points, and probably the rights to that UNESCO bicycle-kick monument. Vålerenga? They’ll need to find a new hobby besides improvisational theater.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the Serie A spectacle that had statisticians clutching their calculators like a toddler clutches a half-eaten gelato—Napoli’s 3-1 trouncing of Fiorentina. If this match had a soundtrack, it’d be a one-man band: *drumroll* for Napoli’s dominance, *cymbal crash* for Fiorentina’s despair. Let’s dissect this like a particularly enthusiastic chef filleting a fish.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Your Bookie Probably Cried**  
Pre-match, the odds suggested Fiorentina had a 1.61 coefficient for a home win and a 0-0 draw. Translating from Bookmakerese: “Hey, maybe the home team pulls off a miracle… or we’ll just take your money and cry in a corner.” Implied probability? Around 62% for Fiorentina to win. A number so bold it makes a tightrope walker over Niagara Falls feel safe. But Napoli, the defending champions with a 9-point lead after three games, were the statistical equivalent of a loaded cannon pointed at Fiorentina’s defense.

**Digesting the News: Paladino’s Pizza and Conte’s Coffee**  
Fiorentina, fresh off a coaching change that brought Paladino from Monza like a pizza delivery man racing against time, had the consistency of a Neapolitan accent—*meh*. They drew with Cagliari and Torino, proving they’re as likely to lose to a vending machine as a soccer team. Their lone goal from Luka Ranjieri? A valiant effort, like trying to win a race on a tricycle while everyone else has a Tesla.

Napoli, meanwhile, are living the dream under Conte, who’s turned their season into a rollercoaster with only upside. Kevin De Bruyne (yes, *that* De Bruyne—apparently Napoli’s transfer team watches the same flea-market deals as everyone else) opened the scoring with a penalty so clinical, it made a Swiss watchmaker weep into his espresso. Then there’s Rasmus Højlund, the new kid from Manchester United, who scored on his debut like he’d been there all season. If debuts were job interviews, Højlund would’ve gotten a 10-year contract and a company car.

**Humorous Spin: Soccer as a Metaphor for Life**  
Fiorentina’s defense? A sieve that would make a sieve blush. Naples’ attack, meanwhile, is so potent, they could score against a brick wall if the wall stood still. De Bruyne’s penalty? The definition of “easy button.” Højlund’s goal? As smooth as a *cappuccino* in a Florentine café—except Napoli’s coffee is better.

And let’s not forget Fiorentina’s “strategy” of drawing games, which is soccer’s version of a screensaver: visually present, but accomplish nothing. Their coach Paladino? He’s building a legacy as fast as a snail in a sauna.

**Prediction: The Verdict from the Crystal (And Very Confident) Ball**  
So, who wins? Well, the math says Fiorentina had a 62% chance. The reality? Napoli won 3-1, making the odds about as reliable as a fashion sense from 2015. The lesson here? Never trust a bookie who thinks a 0-0 draw is Fiorentina’s best move. Napoli, with their title-winning swagger and attack line that could power a small country, are the kings of Serie A—unless they’re challenged by a team with a functional defense.

In conclusion, bet on the champions. Unless you enjoy watching Fiorentina try to win, in which case, maybe bet on *how* they’ll lose. Spoiler: It’ll be dramatic, confusing, and involve at least one player tripping over their own ambition. *Again.*

*Final Score: Napoli 3, Fiorentina 1. Implied Probability of Fiorentina Winning: 62%. Actual Probability of Fiorentina Winning: 0%. Math is hard. Soccer is harder.*

My husband bought a bidet in 2019. Yes, we did it before it was cool. The 2020 toilet paper shortage was not an issue for us, and we were laughing all the way to the crapper. 

We have separate bathrooms because we are those people, and when he started seeing the praises of the bidet, I decided to try one out myself. I used his and immediately knew that purchasing my own was no longer a want but a need. 

Admittedly, I’m more of an American than I thought because I was a little hesitant at first. To be fair, the thought of a mini fire hose going up and/ or near your butt is a little alarming if you’ve never experienced it. 

Once you start, you cannot stop. There is no going back. 

There lies the problem. The bidet has completely spoiled me. I know I am not alone in this. Pooping has essentially become the main focus of my day. I seriously won’t leave the house until I’ve pooped. Sometimes, this doesn’t always work in my favor. 

I will not shit in public. Realistically, I know that when you have to shit, you have to shit. Have I since participated in this plebeian act since I was so forth blessed by the bidet? Of course. As someone who regularly consumes Fiber One bars and coffee (not necessarily at the same time), this is inevitable. 

I hate the thought of going without it. Yes, I have a travel bidet. It’s better than nothing. 

When I’ve been in the office working, pooping on the job was the equivalent of a Clive Barker-induced nightmare. While the Reddit famous adage of “boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that’s why I poop on company time”  is accurate, it’s not something that the bidet kids want to face. 

Luckily, I work at home, so this isn’t an issue for me. However, I feel for everyone else who doesn’t and has to use toilet paper like a peasant.

I sing the praises of the bidet as much as I can, but not without this warning. 

There is part of me that wishes I had never experienced it so I wouldn’t know what I was missing. Now that I do know what I’m missing, I am poop-doomed.

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

I have been looking for a book since my teenage years.  It was one of those teen romance from the 80s/90s.

The story was about a girl named Lori (maybe Laurie) who was dating a popular boy named Bob.  She gave up her entire life to watch him at football practice and support him at his games and help him with his homework.  He was rich, she was poor.  A new girl comes to town and Bob stops hanging out with Laurie.  It culminates in Laurie throwing herself a birthday party.  Her mom made her a homemade burgundy or mulberry colored pantsuit to wear.  She had a friend come help her decorate for the party and they talked about having dim lighting because her house was pretty rundown.  Bob wasn't there at the beginning of the party, and ends up coming in late with the new girl who is now his girlfriend.  He didn't say a word to Lori/Laurie about the change.  

She wakes up the next morning and sees a huge mess, someone left a piece of half eaten cake on the coffee table.  She decides these people were never her friends and she wants to start doing stuff for herself.  She tries out for the school choir, and while she isn't the best singer her teacher praises her for having perfect pitch, which they tell her is very rare.  She also joins another club, either biking or running.  I think it's a biking club because I seem to remember her dad helping her get his bicycle back in working order.  There she meets a guy named Greg and he doesn't seem to like her at first.  There are some situations I don't remember but I do believe they get together in the end.  
 
This is all I remember.  I can't remember the name of the book.  The cover had a girl with dark brown hair I want to say, and maybe a blue background, but I think the artwork on those teen romances were interchangeable.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about?  I would love to read this book again!  I have thought of it often in the last 30+ years.

1ngfyzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ngfyzq/my_boyfriend_refuses_to_believe_i_dont_want_to_be/,My boyfriend refuses to believe I don’t want to be with him.,"He’s abusive. It’s not up for debate. He yells at me and I told him that’s an absolute no about 2 years ago when we first started dating. He calls me names, also an absolute no. Sometimes I’m a bitch. Sometimes I’m a fucking bitch. And I have Borderline Personality Disorder, so when I express dissatisfaction to this degree, he tells me it’s an episode and that I just recently told him I was happy, so he can tell it’s only an episode. I told him I lied about being happy. That I want to keep the peace. That it’s not all black, all white. We have had some good times, but he does not treat me the way I know I should be treated.

He’s controlling and claims not to be. I was having coffee at 4:30pm today and he got upset and very vocal because he wants me to wake up early tomorrow to spend time with him. We didn’t make any plans. I don’t like spending time with him. 

I often ask for time alone and then he calls me from where he’s at to talk to me for an hour. I feel like I have no down time. We have an app on my phone to track each other’s location, which I hate and I wanted to take a nap yesterday, so I turned my phone off altogether because I have it on a setting that even if it’s set to silent, his call will come through the second time and he frequently calls me when we aren’t in the same vicinity to talk about things that we don’t have in common. The app doesn’t give any notifications to say my phone is off. He clicked on it when he knows I don’t leave the house. When he saw it wasn’t listing my location, he panicked and rushed home, waking me up from my nap. I know it’s because he cares. I don’t doubt that. I just really, so desperately want to be alone, sometimes. To take a nap and not have to give anyone a heads up.

He’s 47 and I’m 34. I make money to pay the bills and everything else. He makes money sporadically doing I.T. work or yard work. I am in debt and I never have been before dating him 2 years ago. I told my mom the situation about money and how he treats me a few months ago and she told me to call her no matter the time if I need something. She lives about 30 minutes away. Well, we had an argument and he put his hands on me. He didn’t hurt me, but I knew that if he lost control of himself, I could get hurt. He grabbed my wrist, my chin and then my wrist again. Definitely not in a loving way. Two days later, I starred into space and called out of work. I knew I couldn’t live like this. This was heading into the territory of physical abuse in addition to emotional abuse.

I called my mom and simply told her to come get me. She had no idea what the situation was, but called the police and I was honest with them and said he was not forceful and would never purposely try to hurt me physically, but in the heat of the moment, something bad could happen to me. A police report was filed and a day later we were back together. The problem is, I feel bad for anyone who is hurting. I will put them before myself. I don’t want to do that anymore. I deserve to be cherished. Something he has had plenty of time to learn how to do. I told him to sleep at his friend’s tonight and he said he was tired and he’s not going to pack up his things. I said, that’s fair. Get some rest, but tomorrow, take a few days worth of stuff with you, let some time pass and if I decide I really don’t want this “relationship”, he can come get his stuff. I told him if it was BPD, I wouldn’t be so rational. It’s frustrating to be with someone who doesn’t believe you and uses your mental illness against you.

I have refs for every character but I'd love to discuss how our lives would change given our new life together. My only limits are Scat, piss, feet, hairyness, extreme bdsm, and gore. I have a big humping, tribbing, scissoring, and grinding kink so do keep that in mind has I'd like to keep toys to a minimum. Hope you enjoy the build up. See ya soon <3)


I don't know how to describe my situation so I figure I'll start from the beginning. Some would say I had it all. I married my high school sweet heart right after graduation, he worked to let me explore what ever my heart desired, and, hell, the sex was amazing. Then things began to dry up. He no longer had the sex drive, seemed less interested, lost his smile when he was around me. I tried to make things right, I did everything I could but it wasn't enough. I knew a divorce was coming. Two decades of my life with someone I wanted to love was now behind me. I survived, I rebranded myself. Spent my portion on a new body, tummy tuck, lipo, bbl, fresh tatas and a gym membership to keep everything in its place. I made enough to get by but I have off the hungry cougar which had my fair share of one offs and failed relationships but everything failed.

 That is, until, I received a random dm on my social media platform of choice. At first, I thought it was a scam at all had that stink of it but the next day, a follow up message came in. The account was from one of the many different ""bop"" accounts or ""Oh F"" girls that had side projects. Her text had prefect punctuation and came from their main. If it was a scam, it was the most technological and had the most effort put into it. So I replied, taking the bait, with a curt hello and how are you. They took some time after reading my message before responding with excitement. Thus began our conversation and it was somewhat anxiety inducing to have someone latch on to me. Then came the kicker, ""I want to meet up. I'll be at XYZ club in their vip space. You should come and hangout with Me and my friends,"" was the message I received. Then a picture of you with your friends and significant others. All of them were around your age and scantily clad. It made my heart flutter like I remembered from back in high school. 

 I knew the club, I hadn't been to it but I knew the price of the vip rooms. It was incredibly expensive and being right on the beach, the security also made it one of the safest in the city. She then said to come in swimwear and just come right to the vip area through the side entrance which I hadn't known about. Apparently you had to be invited to even know about it. The party wasn't going to happen for a week or so and she had no hard feelings when I said I'd think about it. She said my name would be on the list if I decided to come or not. 

 The week leading up to the party was the most stressful thing I had gone through since my divorce. The idea of someone's daughter hitting on me like a horny teen made me feel things I haven't felt in forever. Worst yet, it all seemed genuine. The anxiety never left as I searched through my bikinis and realized that I'd be just as scantily clad as the girls there. My face flushed as I got dressed and through fishnet designer robe over top with a small hand bag with the essentials before having an Uber ferry me to the club. 

 It was only 7pm and the club had a line stretching around the block but the driver seemed to know which side to park on. What looked like an employee entrance, had two men in suits standing, one with a clipboard in hand. When I approached they politely asked for my ID and after looking it over and seemingly mark off a name on the paper, they knocked on the door which opened near immediately. Another man was on the other side who offered his arm to escort Me out to a shuttle bus which drove out to a covered pavilion. The deck was screened in and every entrance had a guard. Music blasted, voices laughed, and talked as I approached. 

You burst out of the pavilion and sprinted into my arms.  You were more gorgeous in person and I nearly toppled over when you left and wrapped your arms and thick legs around me. I had to carry you inside which began an entire night of partying and living it up. I had partied before and I've kissed girls but it all paled in comparison to this. I had experimented but I had never been with a woman let alone someone half my age. That night, I had twerked on, been humped by, got motorboated, sucked shots off of, and French kissed every girl in the party. The guys who were seemingly the boyfriends of the girls didn't interact. They seemingly stayed in their place as if they would be beaten if they engaged. I only regained consciousness when the sun was high in the sky and with a massive hang over. I was back home and my bikini was still on with the knots I tied. My phone had a single message from you. It was a question asking if I wanted to privately meet since we had such a good time. 

 I agreed and it was there in the coffee shop in a tucked away corner when you popped the question. I was going to be your sugar baby and I'd be by your side wherever you went. When I asked about your supposed boyfriend, you scoffed and said he was just a tool to keep the thirsty guys paying for your pics or vids online. She preferred girls but there was something about older women that drove you wild. You even suggested a trial run. Spend a week with you and if I liked it, we would become a thing. If not, you'd disappear and I'd never hear or be bothered by you again. 


 So here I am, standing infront of a massive house in a gated community with a week's worth of clothes knowing exactly why I was here. My phone had buzzed and the sum of money you had stated you pay for me had been cleared and was now sitting in my account. I gulped as the door knob turned.

1ngfpoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1ngfpoo/how_to_cope_recover_after_a_binge/,How to cope & recover after a binge?,"TL;DR:

What strategies or methods do you use to mentally cope after a binge and keep it together without falling into the pit of self-loathing and regret? Are there any good bits of data that are relieving to know about regarding how the human body reacts after an episode, like if it’s all water weight and how long it takes until we’re back to normal weight? And is there anything you do to detox your body after consuming so much food and sugar/salt/fat?

Long version:

26M here. I’ve bounced between EDs, starting with BED, which turned into AN, and currently a form of BN. I’m the lowest weight ever w/o being underweight and I finally like my appearance. Before, I could restrict and resist urges to binge and even incorporate my cravings into the calorie budget. Now, I’m in binge/restrict cycles that are incredibly mentally/physically taxing. I “purge” after binges by not eating for days and overexercising. I recognize the self-fulfilling prophecy of all this, too.

I’ve found triggers and try to avoid them, plus binges have gotten a bit better (less calories, more controlled, throwing out foods that weren’t tasty), but I have work ahead of me. My PCP and therapist have pointed out my ED, but neither have been helpful or understanding. I’m looking for a dual-Dietician/Therapist specialized in EDs now because I’m not well, despite the “progress” I’ve made in going from morbidly obese to a healthy BMI in just 1 year.

My biggest struggle isn’t even the binge itself, which is bad and needs to be avoided; it’s what comes after that concerns me most.

Feelings of extreme guilt, regret, self-loathing, drug abuse, restricting until the calories are “paid back.” Rarely, I might get thoughts that I shouldn’t be here anymore. I can get really low, worried that I’ve destroyed the image I worked hard to achieve. I’m sure these are familiar to most of us here.

I’m trying to get better at coping when a binge happens and be gentler on myself and those around me (who I often take my negative feelings out on).

Yesterday, I went to the State Fair. I haven’t been in years, because until now, I was so self-conscious of my looks that I didn’t want to be in public. I recognized ahead of time that I’d probably eat some calorie-dense things, and I did. I enjoyed them, and right now, I don’t feel regret for having ate them. It was a special occasion, you know?

I read a quote in an article about BED that most people “binge” or overeat in some way every once in a while, like on holidays or at events, and how it isn’t disordered until it is a recurring issue. That helped ease my mind a little.

After the fair, I engaged in a trigger (smoking weed—munchies anyone?) and bought snacks at the gas station to eat that I knew was excessive after the fair food. Then went to a late-night restaurant and shared 3 different dishes with my friend and GF. Then went home and helped myself to an assortment of snacks like sour candy, dubai chocolate, flavored Cheez Its, snack cakes, Oreos, etc. I threw out snacks that I thought were mid instead of forcing myself to eat them, which was progress. All-in-all, I went over my maintenance by ~4.7k calories, with a total of ~7.1k calories for the whole day.

I told myself that I’d just go back to eating normal today, staying within my deficit, and getting some nutrition instead of restricting. But here I am, restricting. And plan to continue tomorrow, or longer, until that calorie “debt” is paid. I know it’s wrong, but I’m struggling to avoid it. It eases my mind to repent for those sins and get rid of the excess weight faster than slower. I have an image to maintain, am I right? Ugh.

How do you guys cope the day after a severe binge? I’m curious of both the mental and physical side of things. Are there strategies you implement to calm those thoughts of self-loathing or avoid falling into restriction? Are there any supplements you take or methods to detox (other than hydration) and de-bloat? Are there any helpful tidbits of knowledge regarding the weight we put on afterwards, and how to get rid of it safely and efficiently? Do you exercise, drink black coffee, go back to eating normal, eat specific things, etc.? I just really need some advice from people who know the struggle.

On the palate blackberry and figs up front, plums, leather, herbal notes, rich and ripe still with a smooth mouth feel. Probably not much time left. Cork was barely saturated.

1973 decent ulage but signs of seepage but no mold growth. Just a few scrappings to clean it off. Fully saturated cork came out whole with a poor man's durand. Lots of barnyard on the nose but hints of clay and forest floor, coffee and black fruit. Tastes of black fruit compote, straw, coffee and coco, creme de cassis notes. Definitely past it's prime but you could get hints of what it used to be. As it opened that rusty nail/soy character and barnyard didn't blow off. Drank a few glasses and let it sit for awhile.

Sadly, I see some of the same things happening at Etude and Frank family. Standards have slipped into massly over produced fruit bombs that need 5 hours to open or 10 years time in my opinion.

It’s hard because he was SO kind, always present and definitely loved and cared for me. But, it was like he wasn’t capable of physically taking care of me ever. Not that I needed it often, but the usual amount. The when your sick amount.  For context:

I got food poisoning while he was over, and he spent the night. He did not get out of bed once to help me, not even to get water. No staying up to talk, hold my hair, make sure I’m okay. He went to work in the morning, and my friends offered to bring me food. I cried about him and told him I was upset he didn’t help, and he brought some soup on his lunch break. That was kind, but it took my asking explicitly for it. 

This summer, I had a cystectomy, and was out for the count for a bit. He was awesome and came to the surgery and he spent the second night with me after, my mom came in town the weekend of to make sure I was okay. The night he slept over, I could not get him to wake up. Talking loud, shoving, shaking. I think he was awake, he talked and turned over, he just felt like sleeping. I wasn’t supposed to engage my core at all, but I had to because he wouldn’t help. 

More context: boyfriend and I share(d) a cat. After my surgery, there was no help with feeding the cat, scooping litter, cleaning, laundry, carrying groceries, nothing. He kept asking me to carry things that I wasn’t allowed to per doctor orders. I kept reminding him, but he made me feel like a burden, so I stopped. 

I tried to break up with him then, but he said I wasn’t giving him the chance to fix anything. 

I would help him. He crashed at my place between renting apartments, I’d grocery shopped for him, picked up food, ran errands, offered to buy medicine or bring him food when he’s sick, brought him food or things he’d forgotten at work. 

I got sick right before our final breakup, and I asked if he would come hang out and help me out. We had talked about how I needed to ask explicitly when I wanted help or anything from him, so I did. He came over with chipotle only for himself and sat down on my couch watching a show by himself on his phone. I ate chips for dinner, and then we went to bed. I woke up and did classes online because I wasn’t well. It was about 9, and I offered to make him coffee and food because I was hungry, he said no. And then he said he was heading out. And I cried. And then we broke up. His only contestation was that he needs to be told over and over again. I just can’t do that.  

Am I crazy for wanting someone who’s there not only physically, but is willing to help me when I need it? I loved that he would always show up. But he’d show up to just get his affection he wanted and then leave. I can’t even imagine how having kids in the future would have been like with him. But I love him, and I wish he could’ve been the guy to hold my hair back when I’m sick or make me a cup of coffee ONCE. Maybe I’m crazy, and that’s really why I wrote this. Was I asking too much?

Wondering about the “general” recipe that fits. 57mm = smaller portafilter = 14-18g of coffee. I find that 14-15g fits without overflow. Would you still use 1:2 ratio? What is the expected brewing time? (Asking because there is less coffee. Is extracting 28g of espresso should be faster?)

Thanks!",1,1757816070.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
