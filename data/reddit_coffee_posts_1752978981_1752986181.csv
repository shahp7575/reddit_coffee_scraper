The guy starts asking me things like: “Where do you see yourself in 10 years?” “Would your friends describe you as more creative or analytical?” “What’s your biggest weakness?” 

I answered professionally at first but kept waiting . After like 20 minutes of this fluff, I asked, “Are we going to talk about the actual job? Design tools, energy systems, regulations—anything?”

He said, “We’re assessing cultural fit first. Technical skills are secondary.”

I said, “If you don’t know whether I can do the job, culture doesn’t matter.”

And then no joke he goes, “Can you grab me a coffee from the kitchen before we continue?”

I stared at him for a solid second and said, “I’m not your intern.” Then I stood up and said, “This is a joke,” and walked out.

The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.","Six months ago, I was accidentally poisoned by wolfsbane. The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.

My body gradually weakens.

Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.

On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.

My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.

But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.

Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.

At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.

But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?

Chapter 1

When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.

My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.

""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""

He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.

""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.

""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.

""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""

I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.

But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.

When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.

""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""

My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.

""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""

And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.

But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?

""I agree,"" I said airily.

Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""

He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.

Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""

Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.

Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.

""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""

I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""

Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!

""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""

Slowly, I slipped into a daze.

Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.

And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.

From then on, Laila got the best of everything.

She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.

I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.

Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.

They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.

Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.

Chapter 2

My eyes stung.

Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.

""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""

A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.

Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.

She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.

In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.

Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""

I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.

I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""

This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.

""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""

He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.

Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.

Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.

I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.

If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.

I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.

I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.

I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.

I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.

I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.

I was really dying.

It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.

Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.

""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.

""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""

""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.

Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""

Chapter 3

So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.

Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.

He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.

He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.

The people online immediately realized something was wrong.

How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?

Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.

""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""

Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.

My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?

Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.

Then Simon appeared.

The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.

He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.

He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.

Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.

But when had things started to change?

Was it when Laila began hovering around him, acting sweet like a lover? Was it when she clung to him during our dates, or when they started texting each other over the phone for long hours?

My lover had become the knight of the person I resented most.

I thought I could handle the pain, but it still hurt.

Now that I was dying, I could've just let them have whatever they wanted.

""It's my fault for putting you in this mess. I'll clear your name by telling them that I was the one who plagiarized your work,"" I said.

The moment I apologized, they were stunned. They hadn't expected me to be this obedient.

""You've really started to care for your sister,"" Mom said, her gaze turning complicated. ""I'm glad that you two are finally looking out for each other.""

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad chimed in. ""If you keep this up, your mom and I will surely dote on you!""

Guilt flickered in Simon's eyes.

""You're my mate, so I'll surely take care of you,"" he said, trying to comfort me. ""Even if you can't continue your studies at the Werewolf Academy, you can still live comfortably.""

I tried to smile through the pallor.

However, the future Simon spoke of didn't exist for me anymore. At this point, their love and affection were luxuries I could no longer afford.

Laila turned on the camera and began recording.

""This thesis was written by me at home…"" she sobbed. ""I never thought my sister would claim it as her own.""

As she spoke, she turned the camera toward me.

Dad, Mom, and Simon all watched closely, as if afraid I might slip.

Forcing a smile, I said, ""Laila's right. I plagiarized her work and told my supervisor it was mine. I'm sorry.""

Everyone exhaled in relief.

Laila quickly uploaded the video to the academy's forum. Soon, waves of criticism and insults crashed down on me.

Pretending to be noble, she stepped in at the perfect time to defend me. ""Guys, stop it. No matter what, she's my sister. I've already forgiven her.""

While no one else was looking, she turned to me with a cold, victorious glare and hissed, ""You have no right to compete with me. Mom, Dad, and even Simon are all mine. You don't deserve to be loved by any of them.""

Chapter 4

Laila and I were twins, but ever since we were kids, she'd always resented me.

She hated sharing her things with me. So she stole our parents' attention, my toys, my dresses—even though she had the exact same ones.

She wanted anything I laid my eyes on.

Back then, Mom and Dad treated us equally. I had everything Laila had, and they often lectured her for taking my things.

But since what had happened five years ago, they poured all their heart and soul into Laila. They thought I was selfish for not visiting Dad when he was hospitalized.

So whenever we got into an argument after that, they always took Laila's side.

""How could you bully your sister?"" was what they often told me.

After feuding with her for so many years, I was indeed the one who lost. I could no longer be at odds with her anymore.

""Yeah, you won,"" I said softly.

The kidney transplant surgery would take place in two hours, and I was about to die.

Given how deep the wolfsbane was already in my system, my soul would also be shattered by the time the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my body.

What would be left was only my lifeless body.

By then, would Mom, Dad, and Simon weep for me?

Perhaps not. For an eyesore like me to leave, they'd probably be overjoyed. After all, Laila was the apple of their eye.

Before surgery, Mom, Dad, and Simon huddled around Laila, comforting and encouraging her.

""Laila, don't be scared. We'll be waiting for you outside,"" Dad said in a tone so gentle that I'd never heard before. ""The surgery will definitely be successful. You'll become healthy in no time.""

""After your recovery, I'll make you your favorite dishes,"" Mom chimed in lovingly.

Simon suddenly pulled out a dazzling moonstone necklace. ""I bought the necklace you fancied at the auction last time. After the surgery, I'll put it on for you!""

They were all so focused on Laila that none of them remembered that I was also about to undergo surgery.

I thought I was used to being neglected. But as I neared the end of my life, the sight before me still broke my heart.

I couldn't help but blurt my thoughts, ""Would you be sad if I died during surgery?""

Mom and Dad were stunned. As if they only recalled my existence now, diffidence flickered across their faces.

But once Mom heard what I said, she snapped, ""What nonsense are you talking about? It's just a simple kidney transplant surgery. Stop jinxing yourself!""

Dad also shot me a disapproving glance. ""Don't say that! How could you curse yourself like that? Get sufficient rest after the surgery, and you'll recover in no time. After all, you're much stronger than Laila.""

""I'll cook you a seafood feast after the surgery's over. You love seafood, don't you?""

Gazing at me affectionately, Simon held my hand and said, ""Don't worry. I hired the best healer to perform the surgery. You'll definitely be fine. Once it's over, I'll buy whatever you want for you.""

Bile rose in my throat. He bought Laila's favorite necklace in advance, yet when it came to me, he'd only make such empty promises.

I bet he'd be delighted after I was gone. He could finally be with Laila.

My gaze lingered on Mom, Dad, and Simon before I entered the operating room.

When the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my skin, the last shred of healing ability I had was completely destroyed. The wolfsbane gnawed at my bones and tore my soul apart.

I stopped breathing entirely as I reached the end of my life.

The moment before I took my final breath, I wondered if Dad would weep for me if he found out I was the one who donated my kidney to him five years ago, and it was Laila who took the credit. Would he feel bad for me, who was always on the receiving end of Laila's slandering and bullying?

Would Mom and Dad ever regret looking down on me?

It didn't matter. Even if they would, I wouldn't be around to see it.

I attached a small luggage tag to my keyring with my first name and phone number (no address for security reasons), and it's already paid for itself twice over.

Last month, I accidentally left my keys at a coffee shop after a hectic morning meeting. Instead of them ending up in some generic lost-and-found box, the barista texted me directly before I'd even made it back to my office. Another time, I dropped them in a parking garage, and a kind stranger was able to contact me immediately rather than turning them in to management where they might have sat for days.

The beauty of this system is its simplicity. You don't need anything fancy - just a basic luggage tag from any travel store or even a homemade version with contact info slipped into a small protective sleeve. I was initially worried about privacy, but realized just my first name and phone number provides enough contact information without revealing where I live.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the color… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

     I bought the game at a thrift store, along with Vice City, Shadow of the Collossus, and what I thought was Star Wars: knights of the old republic, but what was actually a SpongeBob dvd.  I thought it would be cool.  I’d played other wrestling games from the ps2 era and remembered liking them when I was a teenager.  
     When I went to check out, the clerk had a shit eating grin.  His “mystery game”, he’d called it.  Said it just showed up outside the store one day.  Wherever it came from, he seemed happy to be rid of it.  I asked if there was anything wrong with it.  
     “Who knows? For $2, does it really matter?”
     I’d pay him $1000 to have kept it now.  A million if I had it.  I’d give anything to go back to before I picked up that copy of WCW Mayhem.  
     My wife had taken our son to visit her sister who lived about an hour and a half away.  They’d be spending the night, so I had the house to myself.  After dinner, frozen pizza and a C4.  I loaded the game into my PS2.  It turns out it was a ps1 game and I hadn’t noticed, but it was backwards compatible so it still played.  As I scrolled through the wrestlers, the nostalgia washed over me.  There were the wrestlers I remembered from the time like the NWO, Sting, and Goldberg.  Some guys I hadn’t thought about in 20 years.  Raven, Kanyon, Kidman; I’d forgotten the Flock even existed.
     Then I got to the Horsemen.  You had to unlock Ric Flair, but that wasn’t the jarring part.  Staring at me from inside the screen was the face of a cold-blooded killer.  Chris Benoit.  The Canadian Crippler.  The startup screen had said 1999, of course he’d be in it.  If this was a new game, that’d be a different story.  But in 1999, he was a rising superstar.  
     I decided to play as him.  I know it’s a dark choice, but I liked him as a kid.  And what he would go on to do notwithstanding, he was an amazing technician.  The developers must’ve thought so too, because I was kicking ass.  It felt like easy mode.  I’d do a couple moves throw in a taunt and my special move would be ready.  I hit it, the crippler crossface, classic, only it didn’t quite look right.  Maybe it was the limitations of the graphics of the time, or maybe because I was playing on a modern tv.  It looked like he was twisting his opponent’s neck past the point where it would break.  Then, instead of the usual tap out animation, the opponent just went limp and fell face first into the mat.  Then during the cut scene where the winner usually would raise his arms, he just stood there with his head down and his shoulders bobbing up and down.  It cut to a closeup and I could see that he was weeping.  He put his hands over his face and the game froze.  
     That was weird.  Old games like this freeze up all the time, but was that reallly his victory animation?  And what was up with that finisher?  It looked like he broke his neck, and had there been a crack?  It was in the background, but I swear I heard a crack.  I turned the game back on, but this time it loaded straight into a match.  I was playing as Benoit, but instead of the opponent from the last match, Scott Norton, it was Nancy.    

     This was fucked up.  I didn’t even know she was in this game.  Maybe she was one of the unlockable characters?  But I had never played this game.  This was a new memory card, mint in box, I was the first owner.  I paused the game.  It was just a game after all.  But I was still hesitant.  Just the knowledge of what he would go on to do to her, and that little boy.  I couldn’t imagine what it would take to do something like that.   
     I was about to eject it and just play something else when the game unpaused itself.  The controller was on the coffee table, I was nowhere near it.  Then the characters started wrestling on their own, only they weren’t really wrestling.  He was beating the shit out of her.  Were the animations different when it was male versus female?  I had never seen these moves, they looked meaner and they left a mark on her character model.  Nancy had a black eye and slumped motionless in the rear turnbuckle.  Benoit retrieved a steel chair from under the ring.  He moved to Nancy, but instead of hitting her with it, he partially unfolded it and placed it over Nancy’s head so that the seat covered her face.  He sprinted across the ring and springboarded back at her, drop kicking the chair.  
     This time the crack was louder.  I know what I heard.  Nancy fell to the mat.  It didn’t even say the match was over, but it went to the victory cutscene.  His head slumped and his shoulders bobbed up and down as if he was crying again.  However, when it cut to the closeup, I wasn’t ready for what was on my television screen.  There stood Chris Benoit, not the pixels on flat planes art of the rest of the game, but a hyper realistic rendition.  It looked like archival footage, I could see his veins, his sweat.  He was crying, but I could see in this hyper-realistic state that he was also smiling.  Laughing like a maniac while tears poured down his face.  
     Fuck this game.  I popped it out and put in Shadow of the Collosus.  I went to the kitchen and made white people nachos in the air fryer.  When I came back to the living room though my heart sank.  I dropped the damn nachos, because what was on my screen was impossible.  WCW Mayhem was loading.  I checked the case for Shadow of the Colossus.  Empty.  Before I had a chance to even think of how this was possible, I saw the ring.  In the center was Chris Benoit as he had originally appeared in the game.  Instead of the an opponent, there was what looked like a machine.  A piece of exercise equipment, specifically a lat pulldown machine.  I watched in horror as the character model approached the machine, and in that crude, 90’s video game animation, took the cable from the machine and wrapped it around his neck.  He then looked at the camera.  No, looked at me, and dragged his thumb across his throat, his signature taunt.  He pulled the pin holding the weight on the machine, the cable tightened and his neck broke.  The screen faded to black, but only for a moment.  When it came back on, it wasn’t the game, it was Chris Benoit himself.  It was how he must’ve been when the police found him, but it wasn’t a crime scene photo.  No, this did not exist, could not exist.  It was like my tv was a window, and on the other side was his corpse.  
     After that, I broke the disc into splinters and collected them in a bag.  I burned the bag in my backyard, but I don’t think this is over.  I wish I could be more optimistic.  If I was a single man it might be different.  But I have a wife and son that I love with every fiber of my being.  I know that no power on earth could compel me to harm them.  By all accounts, Chris Benoit loved his family, but he took too many blows to the head and lost control.  Cte is the most common theory for his crimes.  Brain damage had made him a shell of his former self.  An avatar, like someone else is controlling your body.  Like a character in a video game.
     I love my wife and son, but I’m afraid.  I could never explain to her what happened with the game.  She wouldn’t believe me anyway, think it was my idea of a sick joke.  But what I really can’t explain is how a lat pulldown machine got into our living room.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the color… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush.

Fellow Empathetic Apathists, let’s talk. You know that moment when you’re deeply aware of someone’s emotional meltdown—like, you get their existential dread on a cosmic level—but simultaneously, you’re just… meh? Like, “Sorry your world’s collapsing, but I’m over here sipping coffee, wondering if I left my irony in the dryer.” 😆

So, what’s your secret sauce for balancing that “I feel everything” empathy with the “whatever, life’s a glitchy simulation” apathy? Are you doomscrolling X for catharsis, binge-watching existential comedies, or just staring at a wall while contemplating the futility of it all? Drop your coping mechanisms below—bonus points for the most hilariously detached yet oddly profound ones.

Here’s mine: I listen to sad lo-fi playlists to “honor” the world’s suffering, then switch to speed metal to remind myself I don’t actually care. 🖖 What’s yours?

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the color… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

*(Chapter 03)*","*(I am reposting it due to some issues. Anyways enjoy the story.)*


**Chapter 03 :-** *A night out with friends*


**(Mikasa's POV)**

Wind shrieked in my ears as I stood atop a monstrous, feathered beast, its wings slicing through clouds of steam. The world below was a blur of smoke and ruin. Someone stood beside me—their face smudged into shadows by my dreaming mind.

My hands clenched two bloodied swords, their weight familiar yet foreign. Ahead, two colossal figures clashed, their roars shaking the sky.

**""Now.""** A voice I knew but couldn't place.

Then—I was moving.

A strange device on my hips propelled me forward against my will, hurtling me toward the titans. One of them had a gaping hole in its mouth, and inside—

A head.

A person, half-merged with flesh. Their features were blurred, but my body reacted before my mind could. The swords rose—

Suddenly I woke up from my bed. What a wierd dream.

Gasping, I kicked off my sweat-drenched sheets, the digital clock glaring: 8:00 PM.
**""Shit—the meetup!""**

Sasha's voice echoed in my memory: **""Don't forget!""**


**(Armin's POV - Before Mikasa Arrives)**

The living room hummed with our usual pre-meetup chaos. Sasha had already raided my snack cabinet, her cheeks stuffed like a chipmunk's.  

**""Armin, your pantry is a war crime,""** she mumbled through a mouthful of crackers. **""Where's the actual food?""**  

Connie tossed a carrot at her head. **""Eat a vegetable for once, you trash panda.""**  

Reiner scrolled through his phone, occasionally grunting at memes. Christa and Ymir were tangled together on the loveseat, whispering about some new anime. Bertholdt nursed a soda in the corner, half-asleep as usual.  

I checked the clock. **8:17 PM.**  

**""Where's Mikasa?""** Annie asked, kicking her feet up on my coffee table. **""She's never late.""**  

**""Maybe she finally snapped and murdered someone,""** Connie offered helpfully.  


**(Mikasa's POV)**

The evening air cooled my flushed face as I power-walked through Shiganshina's streets. That dream—those *swords*—clung to my muscles like phantom weight.  

**Why did it feel so real?**  

My phone buzzed. Armin: **""R u dead?""**  

I typed back: **""Be there in 5. Save me food.""**  


**(Armin's POV - Mikasa's Arrival)**

The doorbell finally rang.  

**""Look alive, people,""** I announced. ""The Ackerman has graced us.""  

Mikasa stood in the doorway, slightly out of breath. Her hair was damp at the ends—she'd clearly rushed through a shower.  

**""Sorry I'm late,""** she said, stepping inside. **""I was... tired. Fell asleep.""**  

Sasha immediately pounced. **""Ooooh, tired from what~?""**

Mikasa's deadpan stare could've frozen lava. **""From existing, Sasha.""**

I nudged her as she passed me. **""You good? You look like you saw a ghost.""**

She hesitated just half a second too long. **""Just a weird dream. Where's the food?"" **


**(Connie's POV)**

After Mikasa arrived, we all settled into our usual meetup routine - chatting, playing some games, just enjoying each other's company. Eventually, me, Armin, and Mikasa ended up sitting around the coffee table while others scattered around the room.  

That's when I noticed it.  

Armin was staring somewhere with that spaced-out look he gets when overthinking. I followed his gaze and—oh. Annie. And was he... blushing?  

Well well well.

I nudged Mikasa beside me and pointed subtly at Armin. She caught on immediately.  

**""Oh?""** Mikasa said, her voice laced with amusement. **""Looks like someone's simping for someone at this moment. Right, Connie?""**

I grinned. **""Oh yes. And I definitely know who that someone is.""**  

Armin's head snapped toward us, his face turning scarlet. **""G-guys, you're not making fun of me, right?""**

I couldn't resist. **""Yeah, we're definitely having fun with you.""**

Mikasa sipped her drink calmly while I continued. **""Look man, staring at her won't be enough to make anything happen. If you want to take the next step, just talk to her.""** 

Armin crossed his arms, defensive. **""Why would I talk to her about it? I'm not in love with her.""**

He tried to brush it off, but I noticed Mikasa's expression shift. Where I was just teasing, she seemed... thoughtful. Maybe even serious about what I'd said.  

The clock ticked past midnight before any of us noticed.  

Sasha was half-asleep on the couch, crumbs still clinging to her shirt. Reiner kept yawning every thirty seconds like a malfunctioning alarm. Even Annie—who usually outlasted us all—was blinking slower than normal.  

**""Alright, party's over,""** Armin announced, though he was smiling as he said it.  

One by one, we gathered our stuff. Christa and Ymir left first. Bertholdt practically carried a snoring Sasha over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  

**""Someone text me when you get home,""** Mikasa told each of us in that mom-friend tone of hers.  

I lingered by the doorway, watching Armin and Annie have one of their weird silent conversations—just intense eye contact and micro-expressions.  

**Still denying it, huh?**  

Mikasa nudged me. **""Leave the lovebirds alone.""**  

**""Never,""** I grinned, but let her push me out into the cool night air.  

The walk home was quiet, the kind of comfortable silence that only comes after a really good day. Above us, the stars looked brighter than usual.  

**Same time next week?** Reiner's text buzzed in my pocket.  

I smiled. Obviously.


**(Mikasa's POV)**

The walk home felt longer than usual, my legs heavy with exhaustion. Streetlights flickered overhead as I dragged myself into the apartment building, the elevator's hum the only sound in the sleepy stillness.  

Then—movement.  

At the far end of the hallway, two doors down from mine, a figure fumbled with keys. The dim lighting caught familiar broad shoulders, that messy dark hair—  

My breath hitched.  

**No. Freaking. Way.**

Eren Yeager stood in my hallway, shoving a stubborn key into a stubborn lock. Our eyes met for one electric second before his door finally gave way. He disappeared inside without a word.  

**""Hey,""** I whispered-yelled to Mrs. Vogel, my elderly neighbor who lived between us. She was peeking through her usual crack in the door. **""What's he doing here?""** 

**""Oh, the handsome young man?""** She smiled, adjusting her glasses. **""Moved in this afternoon. Seems quiet—carried up boxes of books instead of beer like the last tenant.""**  

Great. Just what I needed. The human equivalent of a thunderstorm now lived twenty feet from my bedroom.  

I slammed my door harder than necessary, the sound echoing through the thin walls. After a scalding shower that did nothing to wash away the day's frustrations, I collapsed onto my bed.  

My phone buzzed—a text from an unknown number:  

**Unknown: Hey...how are you?**  

For half a second, my traitorous heart whispered Jean before logic kicked in. Too tired to care, I chucked the phone onto my nightstand. Morning-Me could deal with mysterious texts and nightmare neighbors.  

As I drifted off, the last thing I heard was Eren's muffled music through the wall—some angry guitar riff that perfectly matched my mood.

>Carrot picked up Vimes' limp arm and tried to prise his fist open, but even though Vimes was out cold the fingers were locked.

>'I mean, half his *pay*!'

I also love this moment for Angua, where she finally gets to see just what being a ""good copper"" means, and just how much Vimes cares about his officers. And I think it also gives her a greater respect for Carrot since she thought he was just being naive for admiring Vimes as much as he does when Vimes had earned every bit of it.

Also what this says about Vimes that he keeps this secret, he doesn't go around advertising the kind act he's doing, or ask the others to chip-in, he just quietly give up half his pay (which already isn't that much) to help the families of those officers who died>!and If you've read Night Watch you'll recognise some of these names!<

First, after two years of living together she randomly divided everything in the kitchen and started getting her own stuff (own set of spices, own blender, own dish set, own knives). Spices I get bc we cook differently, but the knives, dishes and blender were weird to me as she doesn’t cook often and the stuff I have is in good condition, very clean, and always available ( I clean the stuff as soon as I’m done with it). She did mention that she thinks dishwashers are gross so I think that’s why she got her own dishes, but she also washes her dishes with a 6-month old moldy sponge soooo that doesn’t make sense to me but whatever. It’s just kinda annoying cause now our stuff is all crammed everywhere in a tiny kitchen with 2x of everything. 

Second, she labeled all of her condiments in the fridge which is strange b/c they’re literally all hers. I eat super clean and make any dressing / sauce I’m going to eat for the week in a jar. And I’ve literally never used any of her food; it’s as if she were labeling as a way to ward me off from using her stuff maybe??? 

Third, she unplugs everything. If I put a diffuser on in the bathroom to run for an hour she turns it off as soon as I walk away. If I leave a small light on downstairs so I don’t have to walk through the dark to put my teacup away at night, it’s already off. I use my coffee machine every morning so I just leave it plugged in, she unplugs it every morning. 

Fourth, she’s never cleaned the bathrooms in our apt. One singular time. And the rest of the apt I clean 80% of the time. And I guess going back to my first point, I’m annoyed that one of the reasons she May not want to use my kitchen stuff is because she thinks it’s dirty when she literally never cleans stuff, she’s just tidy. 

I feel awkward saying anything about it since I don’t think it’s major stuff, I just think it’s weird and mostly wanted to rant about it I guess. ",1,1752983945.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

4,000 enlisted as paid soldiers and sailors in His Majesty’s service. 

Of these, 200 were selected to join the elite corps of Royal Marines…

CHAPTER 1 

*South Atlantic, 1814* 

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS *Commerce*’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a *good marine* do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He's built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the *Achilles*: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the *Commerce*’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the *Commerce*: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the *Commerce* as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’*s wake, Major Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the *Commerce* raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you *personally* . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?”

No, that’s not a metaphor. I don’t feel like I’m dying every week. I mean it literally. I die. Heart stops. Blood clots. Breath gone. Lights out.

And then I wake up.

Same place. Same time. Same Monday morning, 7:03 AM, lying in my bed in Apartment 4C of a worn-down building on the corner of Hyde and Rose in a city that smells like regret.

It’s always the same Monday.

My name is Nathaniel Drake. I’m thirty-five years old. No criminal record. No mental illness. I work at a tech firm that doesn’t know what I do. I eat the same cereal every morning. I once had a girlfriend named Alyssa. She left two weeks before the loop started. Told me I wasn’t ""present enough."" I think about that a lot.

That was fifty-three deaths ago.


---

Monday, Cycle 54 – Day One

I wake up, heart pounding. My body remembers things my mind is still catching up on. My throat burns like I inhaled fire. That’s new.

I stumble into the bathroom. I expect to see myself looking like a ghost. But no. Perfectly fine. The mirror doesn’t even show the bruises I know I got in Cycle 53 when I fell down the subway stairs trying to outrun whatever the hell was following me.

I splash water on my face.

“How long can a man die before it finally sticks?” I whisper.

There’s no answer.


---

Day Two

I make my usual stop at the corner bodega. I’ve tried not going before. I’ve tried skipping ahead. It doesn’t matter. The loop finds a way to shove me back into its track.

The bodega guy, Sanjay, waves at me with a smile that hasn’t changed in fifty-four weeks.

""Your usual, Nathan?""

""Yeah. Lucky Strikes and a coffee. Black.""

""You look like hell today,"" he chuckles.

I want to tell him I drowned last Sunday. I want to tell him that when my lungs filled with cold water, I remembered what it was like to be five years old, watching my dad overdose in the kitchen. That death is like memory—it buries itself in places you didn’t know existed.

Instead, I smile. ""Rough weekend.""


---

Day Four

Something new happens.

I’m walking to work. It’s raining. The same beggar on 3rd and Mulholland holds up the same cardboard sign: “TIME IS A PRISON”. Normally I pass him without looking.

Today, he looks at me.

I mean really looks at me.

His eyes are pale, almost glowing. “You’re getting close,” he says.

I stop. ""What did you say?""

He tilts his head. ""I said God bless you, man.""

But that’s not what he said.

I know that’s not what he said.


---

Day Five

I don’t go to work. I’ve tried working through the loop. It never matters. I finish projects, go to meetings, shake hands—and then poof, it’s all undone the next Monday.

Instead, I sit in my apartment, pinning things to my corkboard. A map of the city. Faces of people I’ve met. Sanjay. Alyssa. My boss. The homeless guy. Notes about each death: how it happened, where, how long I lasted. Some of them were accidents. Some... weren't.

I draw a red circle around the phrase I wrote on Day Four: “You’re getting close.”

Close to what?


---

Day Six

I’m dreaming.

I know it’s a dream because Alyssa is there, and she’s smiling the way she used to when we stayed up late watching bad horror movies. Her face flickers like a damaged film reel.

""You’re not supposed to be here, Nate,"" she whispers.

""I didn’t ask for this,"" I say. ""I just want to know why.""

She walks away. I try to follow, but my legs won’t move. The world around me crumbles. Concrete and sky fall into a chasm of light. And then I hear it—a sound I’ve heard in nearly every loop but never remembered until now.

A ticking clock.


---

Day Seven – The Day I Die

I’ve kept track of them all.

I’ve been stabbed, shot, crushed by a bus. Poisoned. Electrocuted. One time I starved to death in a sealed room I couldn’t explain. Another time, I walked into my apartment and someone else was waiting for me. Someone who looked exactly like me.

He said, “Not yet,” and slit my throat.

I’ve tried suicide. It never works. I wake up with scars that vanish by Monday. The loop won’t let me take control. I’m a passenger.

But today… today feels different.

At 11:57 PM, I stand on my balcony, high above the city, watching the rain fall like ash. And then—

I hear it again.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

It’s not a dream this time. The sound is real. It’s coming from the apartment below mine—3C.

I've never thought to go there.


---

Monday, Cycle 55 – Day One (Again)

I wake up gasping. I don’t remember dying. That’s a first.

I rush down to 3C before the thought fades. I knock.

Nothing.

I knock again. Harder.

A woman opens the door. Mid-40s, tired eyes, wearing a NASA hoodie. “Can I help you?”

“Do you hear… ticking?”

She freezes. Her pupils dilate slightly.

“What did you say?”

“I… I think I die every seven days. And I hear ticking. Last night, it came from this apartment.”

She stares at me like I’m crazy, but not surprised.

Then she sighs. “You’d better come in.”


---

Her name is Dr. Mira Leven.

Astrophysicist. Once worked for a black ops program called Project Chrono. A secret initiative to bend time through quantum consciousness. The theory was: if the mind could untether from linearity, it might observe multiple timelines simultaneously.

“Temporal recursion,” she says. “Your mind is looping through realities. You’re not reliving the same week—you’re dying in different timelines, all converging into one consciousness. Yours.”

My head spins. “You’re saying I’m the same me across each death?”

She nods. “You're a sponge, soaking in timelines. Eventually, you’ll collapse.”

“Collapse?”

“Think of a hard drive. Too many writes, not enough memory.”


---

I ask why this is happening.

She doesn’t know.

She says her program was shut down ten years ago. But about a year ago, she started noticing fluctuations. Energy pulses. Temporal noise. She thinks something went wrong. Something breached our reality.

I ask what I can do.

“Follow the ticking,” she says.

I ask what’s causing the ticking.

She doesn’t answer.

Cycle 56. Death #56.

I fall from a rooftop chasing a man who wears my face.

Cycle 57, I suffocate in a concrete box.

Cycle 58, I'm run over by a truck while trying to save a child who isn’t there when I look again.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Always just before I die.

I start seeing things out of place. A photo in my apartment of a vacation I never took. A scar on my arm that shouldn’t exist. Sanjay calls me ""Sam"" one day. My boss tells me I’ve been missing for months.

Time is breaking.

And I’m the crack.


---

Cycle 61

The ticking becomes a voice.

It whispers, garbled, like a corrupted file trying to speak. I record it. Play it backward. Filter the frequencies.

A phrase emerges: “Find the signal.”

Dr. Leven helps me trace it to an abandoned radio tower in the industrial district—Tower 9, scheduled for demolition a decade ago.

We go there on Day Seven.

Inside is a machine.

Not a radio.

Not really.

It’s a mass of wires, screens, rotating arms. An obsidian cube in the center pulses with each tick.

Dr. Leven gasps. “That’s not from here.”

I step closer.

The ticking stops.


---

Day Seven, 11:59 PM

The cube opens.

Inside is a chair. Like something out of a sci-fi movie.

The machine wants me to sit.

Dr. Leven begs me not to.

""You won’t come back.""

""I never do.""

I sit.

The world shatters.


---

The In-Between

I am nowhere.

I am every Nathaniel Drake that has ever existed, all collapsing into a singularity. I feel each death. Each choice. Each failed attempt at love. Each scream. Each silence.

And then I see it.

A shape, massive and unknowable. A presence behind the machine. Watching. Studying. Not God. Not the Devil.

Something else.

Something… curious.

It speaks without speaking:

“AWARENESS IS THE DISEASE. YOU ARE THE SYMPTOM.”

I ask what it wants.

It shows me Earth.

Not just one—all of them. Multiverses like bubbles rising in a boiling pot. Each week, one pops. I die. But my consciousness escapes. Like smoke.

I’m not dying.

I’m shedding.

Becoming something that cannot be unmade.


---

Cycle 62

I wake up.

But not in bed.

I’m in Tower 9.

The machine is silent.

Dr. Leven is gone.

I step outside. The city looks the same… almost.

People stare longer than they should. Shadows twitch in sunlight. A man on a rooftop waves, then jumps—and floats upward.

Something has changed.

A piece of me never came back.


---

I don’t die this week.


---

Epilogue

I sit in my apartment. 4C. No ticking.

But I still don’t sleep.

Because I feel them—other versions of me, trapped, screaming, looping. Thousands. Millions. I was the leak. The exception. The broken data packet that spilled out.

And now I can see.

Not with eyes.

With understanding.

This world… isn’t the first.

And it won’t be the last.

I write this in case someone else hears the ticking. In case someone else starts waking up after death.

You are not crazy.

You are not alone.

And whatever it is—

It’s still watching.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

1m4fahj,https://www.reddit.com/r/write/comments/1m4fahj/the_fighting_tops_chapter_one/,The Fighting Tops: Chapter One,"During the North American War of 1812, over 10,000 slaves escaped to the safety of British lines. 

4,000 enlisted as paid soldiers and sailors in His Majesty’s service. 

Of these, 200 were selected to join the elite corps of Royal Marines…

CHAPTER 1 

*South Atlantic, 1814* 

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS *Commerce*’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a *good marine* do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the *Achilles*: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the *Commerce*’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the *Commerce*: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the *Commerce* as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’*s wake, Major Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the *Commerce* raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you *personally* . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?”

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS *Commerce*’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a *good marine* do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the *Achilles*: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the *Commerce*’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the *Commerce*: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the *Commerce* as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’*s wake, Major Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the *Commerce* raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you *personally* . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?”

The pattern is always the same. The guy suggests something casual like coffee, ice cream, or a walk. I’m fine with that in theory. I don’t need some elaborate dinner. I’d be perfectly happy with something simple like a salad bar. 

But what ends up happening is these “quick” hangouts turn into 3-5 hour marathons. We’re walking in circles or sitting on a bench talking forever. Half the time it’s evening and I’ll ask if they’ve eaten, and the answer is always something like “I meal prep,” “I don’t eat out,” or “I’m trying to be frugal.” I get it. I meal prep too. I’m not careless with money either. But if I’m spending hours getting to know someone new, I’m happy to sit down (and in this heat - indoors) and eat something together. It doesn’t have to be fancy

One guy did suggest going to a bar, which I thought was promising, but then added that they have cheap happy hour beer. Cool, but why is everyone so focused on saving a few dollars while on a first date?

I work full time. I’m also studying for exams. My time is limited and valuable. So I’ve decided I’m capping first dates at two hours. If we’re actually getting food and it feels like a real connection, then maybe I’ll stay for three. Otherwise, I’m done giving up entire evenings for low effort meetups that feel more like time fillers than genuine attempts to get to know me. I also dress nicely, put on makeup and contacts and shower + put on nice perfume for these dates. Next time I’m not doing all this just to get ice cream and sit outside on a bench like a homeless person. 

A friend told me I’m being too rigid and should just go with the flow. But I don’t think I’m asking for too much. I just want to feel like someone put even a little thought into spending time with me.

Am I overreacting?

4,000 enlisted as paid soldiers and sailors in His Majesty’s service. 

Of these, 200 were selected to join the elite corps of Royal Marines…

CHAPTER 1 

*South Atlantic, 1814* 

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS *Commerce*’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a *good marine* do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the *Achilles*: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the *Commerce*’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history.

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure.

Chapter 1   
POV Leo   
Three months at Harvard, and I'm still mentally reciting the same two rules my security detail drilled into my skull before shipping me off to America. Rule one: Keep your head down and your identity buried. Leo Brennan, rich kid from nowhere special—not His Royal Pain-in-the-Ass. Rule two: Stay safe. No one-night stands. No getting messy with people who might remember your face when you're sober. Simple. Clean. Bulletproof. Except bulletproof plans don't account for Thursday night basement parties where the bass rattles your organs and freedom tastes like cheap beer. ""Leo! My dude!"" Tyler-or-Trevor from Econ crashes into me, beer sloshing. ""You're looking way too sober for a Thursday night. This is a tragedy that needs immediate correction."" ""Working on it,"" I laugh, raising my red Solo cup. ""Though whoever bought this beer clearly harbors deep resentment toward human taste buds. I'm pretty sure this violates several Geneva Convention guidelines."" ""That's the beauty of it though,"" he grins, already wasted. ""After your third cup, your taste buds just give up. It's like Stockholm syndrome but with more regret in the morning."" The crowd's thick, sweaty, perfect. Nobody here gives a shit about my posture or which fork I use. I push toward the backyard to escape the Axe body spray cloud. That's when I spotted him. Dark hair, pretentious scarf, leaning against the porch railing like he stepped out of a cologne ad. Something about the way he holds himself, confident but not trying too hard, makes my brain short-circuit and my pants unexpectedly tight. God, he’s hot. And he’s checking me out as well. Okay... ""Not a fan of the sardine can in there either?"" His voice cuts smooth through the party noise. ""Or are you just out here having one of those deep, drunk philosophical moments? Like pondering why hot dogs come in packs of ten but buns come in eights?"" Rule one: Keep your head down. Rule two: No hookups. But his smile is crooked in this perfect, devastating way, and suddenly my carefully constructed rules feel like suggestions written in disappearing ink. ""Actually, I was calculating exactly how many brain cells this beer is murdering."" I moved closer, because apparently my survival instincts died somewhere over the Atlantic. ""But your theory has merit. Though I have to say, the view out here just got significantly better than any philosophical crisis."" He laughs, genuine and unguarded. ""Okay, that's either incredibly smooth or incredibly cheesy. I'm genuinely torn between being impressed and concerned for your game."" ""Why choose? I'm all about defying categories."" Close enough now to smell his cologne—definitely not drugstore variety. ""I'm Leo, and yes, I'm using my real name at a sketchy house party because I like to live dangerously."" Real name. Well, fake real name, but still. Already breaking rule one. ""James,"" he grins as his hand lands on my jaw, tracing soft circles with his thumb. Two rules, two rules, two rules… Before I can catch myself from falling into another possible problem, his lips are already on mine and we're kissing like the world's ending in five minutes. Fuck it. We crash into the shadows behind overgrown bushes. His mouth is hot against mine—demanding in a way that girl from last night's party definitely wasn't. What was her name again? Something with an A. God, I love Harvard. Zero accountability, maximum debauchery. His hands slide under my shirt, and I grab his hair, rougher than I mean to. ""Jesus fucking Christ,"" James gasps against my neck. ""Where the hell have you been hiding all semester?"" I laugh, breathless. ""Library, lecture halls, having existential crises in the quad at 2 AM—you know, the usual."" His thigh slides between mine. This is what I came to America for—the freedom to kiss whoever makes my pulse spike without some royal advisor calculating the diplomatic fallout. Back home, every attraction comes with a risk assessment report: which gender would trigger fewer tabloid meltdowns, which family has the right bloodline. Here? I get to map the contours of my bisexuality in real-time, messy and unfiltered. That's when I feel it. That prickle at the back of my neck, the same warning system that kept me alive through nineteen years of palace intrigue. ""Hey, what's wrong?"" James pulls back. ""You just went all rigid. If I'm moving too fast or—"" ""No, it's not you."" I scan the yard and freeze. Someone's by the back fence, half-hidden in shadow but not actually trying to hide. Dark clothes, straight posture, features cut sharp enough to slice the night air. Weirdly hot in that ""might be dangerous but I'm into it"" way. ""I think we have an audience,"" I mutter, skin prickling. ""And not the casual kind."" James follows my gaze. ""Okay, that's weird as hell. Friend of yours?"" When I look back, the figure's vanished. Gone like smoke. ""I... no. Maybe. Fuck if I know."" My paranoia's doing Olympic-level gymnastics now. ""Sorry, too many true crime podcasts. I'm being weird."" We exchange numbers with promises we both know we won't keep, and I spend the rest of the night trying to shake that watched feeling. Two days later, I'm in the library when I spot him again. Same dark clothes, same eerie stillness, three tables away with a book that's definitely just a prop. ""This is getting fucking ridiculous,"" I mutter. ""What's ridiculous?"" Ashley, my study partner, looks up from her notes. ""The fact that Professor Chen assigned forty problems, or that half of them aren't even in the textbook?"" ""Both, but also—"" I nod toward my stalker. ""That guy's been everywhere lately. Starting to feel like I'm the star of someone's really boring surveillance footage."" Ashley squints across the library. ""Dark and broody at three o'clock? Huh. He's got that whole 'might murder you but make it look good' vibe. I'm intrigued."" ""Your taste in men remains deeply concerning, Ash."" I snap my book shut. ""But whatever, I'm too wired to focus anyway."" Next day, Jake and I are queuing for coffee when guess who's three people behind us? Mr. Mysterious. ""This is escalating from weird to restraining order territory,"" I whisper to Jake. ""Like, does he not realize how obvious he's being? It's insulting to my intelligence."" ""Maybe he's just really bad at being subtle?"" Jake whispers back. ""Or maybe he's into you but has the social skills of a houseplant. You do attract the weird ones."" ""Thanks for that vote of confidence in my judgment."" I grab my coffee, and sure enough, Dark and Broody is tracking my movement like I'm a GPS dot. ""If I end up on a true crime podcast, I'm haunting your ass first,"" I mutter under my breath. By the time I exit Statistics on Tuesday and find him leaning against a tree in the courtyard—not even pretending to hide anymore—I'm done. My anxiety's been through the roof for days, I've barely slept, and I'm sick of feeling like prey. ""Fuck this,"" I mutter, changing direction mid-stride. He doesn't run when he sees me coming. Doesn't even look surprised. Just watches with those unnervingly calm eyes like he's been expecting this. ""Alright, we need to have a serious conversation about boundaries."" I plant myself directly in front of him, no way to escape. ""Because this whole following me around campus thing? It's not mysterious or intriguing, it's creepy. Like, 'call campus security and file a police report' levels of creepy. I don't know what your damage is, but if you wanted to get to know me, stalking wasn't exactly the best way to go about it."" He doesn't flinch, doesn't even blink. Just holds my gaze with unnerving steadiness, those dark eyes assessing me like I'm a puzzle with missing pieces. Then he glances at his watch—an expensive one, I notice—before looking back at me with an expression that makes my skin prickle.

1m4f4b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZigBee/comments/1m4f4b4/odd_issue_with_sonof_pro_running_z2t_tasmota/,Odd issue with Sonof Pro running Z2T (Tasmota),"I have an older style Sonof Pro bridge that for several years has run as a local controller for a remote summer cabin.  It's perfect for the job, because it can run on a minimal current, and tack on to a nearby Wifi signal to relay data back to an MQTT server at home.  Local rules let me have a scene switch control most of the relays/lights locally, while sensors can log their data with the main system at home most times.

After literally years of working, this past week it did something odd.  It rebooted, spontaneously, and the zigbee radio *refused to start*, saying **""timeout, goto label 99""**. Mind you, Wifi and MQTT still ran. Just the Zigbee radio failed to start. I was also running an older firmware (13.2) and ZNF firmware (2022 based), and nothing in the network had changed in months.

After multiple googles and frustration, I decided maybe updating to current (15.1) may help.  That did change the error I got, to **""Failed to start in coordinator mode, try changing PanID.""**  This was confusing, because there are no other potential coordinators anywhere near here.  No new devices, nothing. Just a failing coordinator.  But on 15.1, the error was very fast. Not a 10 second delay like 13.2 had done.

After trying several things (including flashing the ZNF firmware again), and nothing working, I decided to bite the bullet and do a full reset/reflash, which got the device working again. After a hard reset (40s hold), it rebooted, it came right up, and was fine. I connected it to wifi via the AP, and went to reload a config save I had from a couple months before. On reboot, it instantly failed again.  But I did note it changed the PanID back to the original number (which it had randomized during reset).

I decided at this point to try to set a new PanID (this time via ZbConfig), which again wiped the tables and rebooted, and it started right up.  Change it back, instant failure.  So I changed it to something working, and figured this was just my fate, and started the process of re-pairing.

I started with a socket module that was close to me.  Went into pairing mode, long held the button on the device, and it paired up. My MQTT setup relies on renaming the devices (like P-CoffeeMaker), as short-IDs can be unreliable, so I started the console command to rename it (ZbName).  On entering the short-ID the browser auto-complete had the proper name.  I was the same short-ID as the prior network!  As I paused to think about this, the join timed out, and a few moments later 3 more devices self-joined!  Mind you, the Pro was no longer in pairing mode, but these devices still self-joined, all with their old short-ID numbers.  This along with autocomplete made renaming trivial.  In the end I only had to manually re-pair 3 of 14 devices, while the rest self-added.

So I'm left with a couple questions:

1. Why did the controller suddenly not work on a PanID that it had been using for years?
2. Why after a change out and back did it still fail on just that PanID?
3. How did the devices self-join when not in pairing mode, after a PanID change?

To be clear, I'm not complaining too loudly, since once I figured out what to do, and fixing it took far less time than I expected it would once it was up and running again.  But I'm still confused as to how it got into this bad state to start with.",1,1752982799.0,ZigBee,1,1.0,False

I own Lelit Victoria for quite some time and I have OPV adjusted to start the shot at around 9.2 bar. That setting worked really well for me for my cappuccino addiction using some very fresh and exotic single origins.  
  
But espresso shots were too bitter so never enjoyed them.  
  
But recently for the first time in my life I drunk a better coffee in coffee shop that I can make at home and it was an espresso shot and now I am hooked to extract something similar at home.  
  
I read that Lelit machines using vibration pumps like Victoria does do really well with 7.5bar for espresso shots.   
  
Any experience with that?  
  
BTW am I right that adjusting OPV is basically the same as opening steam wand to lower the pressure dynamically? As adjusting OPV dictates how much water is split back into tank, while with steam wand, how much water is split into that path?

My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

“You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.”

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—”

“Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the *hell* are you wearing?”

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

“I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs.

I didn’t even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room.

I was just so… *tired*.

Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible.

I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door.

*God. I did look awful.*

The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig—it sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe.

Then—my phone buzzed.

*LUCA STEELE.*

I swallowed hard.

I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice.

By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone.

*The mask was back.*

I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly.

“*She looks like a blind clown.”*

*“I heard she lives in her car*.”

“*She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.”*

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t break stride. I never did.

Luca’s office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking.

He didn’t look up.

His office was cold, like everything else about him—monochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth—heat. Intensity.

Luca Steele, age twenty-nine, CEO of one of the most ruthless corporate empires in the world. Jet-black tousled hair. Perfectly sculpted jawline. That expensive three-day stubble that looked like it belonged on a magazine cover. And those eyes—ice-colored and emotionless.They’d never softened. Not once.

I handed him the corrected reports in silence.

He barely acknowledged me.

“Get me Victoria Ames on the line. And fix the deck from slide 8 onward. It’s sloppy.”

“Yes, Mr. Steele.”

I turned, heading for the door. My phone rang. I paused, glanced at the screen. *Unknown Number.*

“Hello?” I whispered.

A soft voice crackled on the line. “Hi, this is Carla from the reception desk. There’s… um… there’s a man here to see you.”

My stomach tightened. “A man?” I said, confused. “Who?”

She hesitated. “He gave his name. Said you’d recognize it.”

I waited.

“Jonathan Kingsley.”

When comparing green tea vs black tea caffeine, it’s clear that black tea generally contains more caffeine:

||
||
|Tea Type|Caffeine per 8 oz (240ml)|
|Green Tea|20–45 mg|
|Black Tea|40–70 mg|

If you're looking for a mild caffeine boost without the jitters, green tea is ideal. Black tea, however, is perfect for those who want a stronger energy lift, especially as a morning alternative to coffee.

# Antioxidants

* Green tea is rich in catechins, especially EGCG, known for powerful antioxidant effects
* Black tea contains theaflavins and thearubigins, which support heart health and digestion

>

# Taste & Pairings

||
||
|Tea Type|Flavor Profile|Common Pairings|
|Black Tea|Strong, bold, full-bodied|Milk, lemon, sugar|
|Green Tea|Light, vegetal, sometimes grassy|Usually served plain or with lemon|

# Processing

Green tea is steamed or pan-fired to stop oxidation, while black tea is fully oxidized, resulting in a richer flavor and darker color.

# Weight Loss Support

Green tea- helps burn fat and boost metabolism, thanks to high levels of EGCG.

Black tea- may reduce fat absorption and support digestion, with its theaflavins.

Both can aid in weight management when paired with a healthy diet.

1m4eyvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1m4eyvk/the_fighting_tops_chapter_one/,The Fighting Tops: Chapter One,"During the North American War of 1812, over 10,000 slaves escaped to the safety of British lines. 

4,000 enlisted as paid soldiers and sailors in His Majesty’s service. 

Of these, 200 were selected to join the elite corps of Royal Marines…

CHAPTER 1 

*South Atlantic, 1814* 

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS *Commerce*’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a *good marine* do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the *Achilles*: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the *Commerce*’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the *Commerce*: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the *Commerce* as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’*s wake, Major Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the *Commerce* raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you *personally* . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?”

Someone who understands me, completes me, makes me feel loved, cared for and whole.

Someone I can laugh with, have deep conversations with and care so much about in this whole world as if she is the only person that matters.

I'm a Simple man who treasures every moment of his life. I love Humor, watching wrestling, football, movies, shows, listening to music and going out to enjoy the weather and get a good meal at a good restaurant or a coffee.

When I get time, I like writing my own original songs and stories, make YouTube videos or work on my future Business ideas.

I'm a Muslim by faith but Spiritual. I believe religion. Is one's own personal connection to God so it's just your heart that matters to me. 

If your love is as deep as the ocean and as bright as the stars and eyes that a man can drown in. If your words and conversations provide comfort to my soul and your touch heals my soul, what more can I ask for? That's the woman I want to settle down with.

If you believe you are that woman, feel free to send me a chat. I'd love to know you better and see where this goes.

Also, I live in Massachusetts, United States but I don't mind which part of the US you're from, Europe, Canada or Austrailia. I believe if there's a match and strong love in the future, then true love has the power to close the distance. Where there's love, there's always a way!

1m4erq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1m4erq6/union_battle_with_bucks_still_going/,UNION BATTLE WITH BUCKS STILL GOING?,"Full disclosure. I do not go to Starbucks. I make my own simple coffee at home as I work from home now... a while back,  When I was part of the corporate world, I was there daily for my ""Fraps""... I also was banned from ordering 4 shots of espresso with cream, sugar, drizzle of Carmel, Iced with whip cream... If I remember it was a specialty drink costing about 8$ but since I ordered the shots, and rest as add on, I paid about 3 or 4$ .... I called it a ""hack"" (I worked as an insurance agent in Boston downtown making a Wapping 29k a year!!!) So anything I could do to save money, I did So I could make my rent payment... I belive its no longer allowed to order in such manner.... 

Anyway, I saw a small video about a walk off in a Disney location. Managers, employees and bartista simply wanted to get attention to CEO about overworked, underpaid, and a 4 min rule- stressing everyone out, and being unattainable- 
So I looked at some data about nationwide # of locations, daily and annual revenue,  and then I recall the CEO flies in a private jet as a daily commute???? 
So I started thinking.... is the union battle still and issue with Starbucks, are employees still struggling to make rent? Has there been and positive bottom line help to employees in form of actual $ compensation? Higher pay? Bonus? Help with living expenses, education and promotion incentives?... based on my research there are about 16-17 thousand locations in the USA alone? 
Total US rev 2022 11.53 $ Billion 31.6$ Million a day in 16,000 locations??? 

Final questions: is there a battle with corporate against unions still to suppress demands and requests by employees management?

packing my bag with the weight of what might happen.

1m4eon1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1m4eon1/the_important_thing_i_learned_from_a_recent_bout/,The important thing I learned from a recent bout with health anxiety,"Thirteen years ago I beat leukemia.  And ever since then I've had health anxiety.  It has gotten easier to control over the years, but it's always there - lurking, lingering in the back of my mind.  And recently it came storming back like a bat out of hell.

Back in March, I got a cyst removed from my eyelid that I'd had for over five years.  It never bothered me, but it had very slowly gotten a little bit bigger.  I thought it was a chalazion.  Pathology came back - it was a fibrous nodule with ""atypical mast cells, benign in nature"".  The recommendation was to get my blood tested, just to be sure. Not exactly what I wanted to hear.

About a week later, I suddenly had some issues involving my groin and left testicle.  It stuck around for a few days, and I started to worry.  Bathroom run at work? Testicular self-exam. Shower at home? Testicular self-exam. Sometimes more than five times per shower. Sleeping on my side, with my legs together, became nearly impossible because of this sensitivity. Then my mind really started to wander.  Are the eyeball cyst and this newfound issue somehow related?  Worrying led to Google.  Google led to Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.  MCAS led to an issue with my blood.  Again.  There it was.  It's back. Its been thirteen years, and it's back, in some crazy new way that's affecting two completely different parts of my body.

Instant gratification - I need to solve this, and solve it now.  I can't produce at my job with this weighing on me.  I can't wait to see a doctor.  I need this groin issue to go away - NOW.  I'm single - who the FUCK do I talk to about this?  So, I talked to a doctor on a video call while on my break at work.  $35 and you're connected to a ""doctor"" instantly.  She prescribed an antibotic - a potent antibiotic, thinking I had some sort of testicular infection.  Took that for 10 days, nothing changed.  I tried to suppress the worry, to work throught the stress.  I became impatient, impulsive, and rude.  I called my old oncologist, whom I hadn't spoken to in years.  I got up at work, walked out of my office, and called him in the parking lot.  I needed reassurance.  I needed answers.  He told me he couldn't diagnose me, but told me not to worry.  It didn't work.  I started to lose weight - a few coworkers commeted on it.  My muscles ached.  I downloaded an app which let me order Valtrex - antiviral for herpes, which I've never had.   I didn't know what else to do.  Had a urology appointment the following week, but couldn't wait for answers.

Fast forward a week, the Valtrex did nothing.  Its been three weeks and the issue hasn't gone away.  Every little bruise or itch I get has me thinking the worst.  I'm staring at myself in the mirror, dissecting what I see.  I notice that the left side of my neck is slightly larger than the right side (I've always had this).  ""It's a lymph node,"" I think.  I start aggressively feeling for a mass in my neck, before I go to bed, as I'm driving to work, while I'm at work, while I'm on the couch.  Imagining this swollen lymph node has me convinced that it's actually there.  Swollen lymph nodes can be a sign of leukemia.  I have to force myself to stop.  *""I have a bump on my eye, I'm losing a little weight, my testicle aches, I'm not eating as much, I have a mass in my neck.  I'm going to die.""*

Urologist does an exam, doesn't suspect an infection.  Can't find anything suspicious on the testicle.  Pee test comes back clear.  Does a basic physical exam, feels a tiny little protrusion.  ""I think you have a hernia,"" he says.  Imaging confirms this - not one, but THREE small hernias, all three in my inguinal canal (the groove at the hip, where the leg meets the groin).  I make an appointment to have them surgically fixed.  Turns out, they can cause referred issues to the entire area, including the private parts, because they move the nerves in that area around.  And he tells me that as my body gets used to the hernias, the symptoms should subside.

Within a few days, the issues with the groin and testicle completely disappear.  But, BUT!!  A new issue arises.  Constipation.  Bad constipation, and an associated loss of appetite.  No matter how hard I try, I can't go to the bathroom.  And when I take a softener, all that comes out is a little bit of liquid.  Not pretty, I know.  But this constipation persists.  I feel full fast.  And this leads to a whole new round of Googling.  These are things I actually Googled:

* inguinal hernia and constipation
* can inguinal hernias paralyze the bowel
* symptoms of bowel \*\*ncer
* prostate \*\*ncer and hernias
* how MCAS affects the bowel

So there I am, with one issue solved, but another one happening.  I can't help but think that all of this is related by some bigger, unknown, deadly cause.  Are the hernias *really* causing these digestion issues?  My dad, noticing the worry on my face, hands me a book called ""Fiber Fueled"".  It has now been since May 8th that I had that video call with the doctor.  I flip to the index and read every page that mentions constipation.  I decide to follow the book's advice.  I start eating sauerkraut by the forkfull.  Daily probiotics, magnesium, and fiber.  Lots of fiber.  No dairy, six different fresh sources of fiber a day.  I've never eaten as many kiwis in my life.  I become a new owner of a squatty potty.  I'm desperate to poop again, starting to worry that I'll never have another normal BM in my life.  That dreaded \*\*ncer word keeps sounding off in my mind.  Not for the testicle this time, but for the bowel.

Last Wednesday, I start to feel really gassy.  Probably a good thing, I think.  It means something's happening down there.  Then, a poop.  A small poop, but a poop nonetheless.  Friday for lunch, my boss orders food.  I wolf down a Five Guy's cheeseburger like there's no tomorrow, and realize that my appetite is back.  Yesterday?  I wake up.  Coffee, feeling like a poo.  And I sit, and OH, THE GLORY!!!! WHAT A POOP!!! Followed by anoher one at lunch.  And another one, four hours later.  I'm releasing massive amounts of it, weeks of blockage.  It is a magical day.

And then this morning, I sit up in bed and realize....that the stress is gone.  That I feel happy.  That I *want* to eat breakfast.  I go to the gym, run five miles on the treadmill.  Eat a big lunch, no bloat.

I'm back.

And that's the story about how several unrelated things, and some bad timing, and some panic, led me down a very dark path for the last 2 1/2 months.  The eye thing?  Completely unrelated to everything else.  I just chose to have it sent to pathology right before my lower half went haywire.  Benign, like the pathology report had originally said.  The testicular/groin issue?  Three small hernias, that I probably got at the gym, and aggravated during a particularly labor intensive day at work (sometimes, I'm out in the field).  The constipation?  A gut imbalance, my intestines completely wrecked by the medications I took for the testicle issue, poor decisions that I made in a state of panic.  Medications that were completely unnecessary and did NOTHING but harm.  Medications that made me sore and suppressed my appetite.  A gut imbalance that was healed by some probiotics, prunes, patience, and kiwis.

And so, what I've learned is that if there's a simple explanation, and a simple path to follow, that is usually the right answer.  For me, thinking that I was dying (thanks, Google!) was really a few hernias and a simple case of disbyosis, healed by following the program in that book my dad handed to me.  The first time he told me ""you need to eat more fruits and vegetables"", I shrugged it off - I almost laughed at him.

""*What's going on here is way more complicated than that!""*

Turns out, it wasn't.  And all that stress, all that panic, all that worry that I've had since early May, was avoidable.  I made it worse by giving in to the anxiety, and by making brash decisions in the heat of the moment.

The mind is a very powerful thing.  Through a combination of anxiety and stress, I had *convinced* myself I was sick, so much so that I created a lump in my neck that was never really there. So much so that the stress in my body said hey, let's stop eating for a little while.  Let's lose a little weight.

So, the next time you're going through it, take a step back, breathe, stay off of Google, and remember that the human body is very, very good at solving its own issues.  Don't let the panic take over.  Drink water, eat healthy, sleep, and do the basics.  Breathe.",13,1752981364.0,HealthAnxiety,2,1.0,False

I’m getting married soon and just paid my final invoice to my photographer so believe me, I get it. That’s why I tried to plan something super low-key for my bachelorette.

My original hope was a chill resort or hotel weekend with a massage and pool time, but hotels were too expensive, so I shifted plans. Instead, I suggested something local: we could all get massages, go to dinner, stay at my house, grab breakfast in the morning, and then do a casual craft activity together the next day. Nothing over the top.

Here’s where I’m stuck. I paid for everything. My own massage. My own dinner. My own breakfast. The craft activity. I even paid for everyone else to do the craft and bought everyone coffee. No one offered to cover anything — not even split my massage or treat me to breakfast.

I wasn’t expecting a whole weekend paid for. But I did expect that someone might offer to cover one small thing to celebrate me. And now I feel like a spoiled brat for even feeling this way.

My heart dropped when the bus just left and I looked around to see an empty taxi because I only have 18 minutes left before the devil himself leaves the office to go to a meeting.



Shit.



Chapter image

The office is 12 blocks away and it will take me around 20 minutes to arrive there if I'm running my ass there. But I can't run again, this 2 bags are so heavy and I bet I will spill the latte everywhere. I gulped nervously and looked for an empty taxi. I tried to wave my hand trying to get a taxi.



""You! Brunette with 2 duffel bags! Hop in!"" I turned to see a taxi driver waving at me. I quickly ran towards him and got inside.



""Denver office please.. 6 blocks away.. please.. be fast.. or my boss will kill me."" I said completely knocked out.



""Roger that!"" The taxi driver said as he stepped on the gas. I checked my phone right away to see if the devil needs anything else. I smiled when I saw there's no message from him.



I turned my head to the driver and saw his name on the dashboard. His name is Eddy Brown and I think he's in his 40s. I took a really deep breath and let it out slowly.



""You know.. I'm completely surprised to see a skinny girl like you carrying 2 big duffel bags."" He said as he glanced at me through the mirror. I chuckled sadly and sighed.



""People always said that and I think that's why my boss hired me."" I said as I turned my head to the window.



""I'm Eddy by the way."" He said in a really friendly tone. I turned to him and smiled.



""I'm Dakota and thank you for calling me earlier."" I said chuckling.



Chapter image

""Your welcome and here you go."" He said as he pulled up right in front of my office building. I gave him 20 dollars and got out from the taxi real quick.



""Dakota, here's the change!"" I heard Eddy calling me and I turned to him kneeling a little bit. I smiled at him and said, ""Keep it.. you saved me today and I hope you have a great day, Eddy."" I said as I waved at him.



""Thankyou and you too!"" He said and I nodded. I checked my watch and I ran inside the building quickly. I gestured everyone in front of me to get out of my way. I felt like I'm Moses from the bible.. you know when God asked him to split the sea. I'm splitting people out of my way.



I have 3 minutes left and I pressed the lift button as quickly as possible hoping that it will come faster. I gulped nervously looking at all 6 lifts, waiting for one of them to open their freaking door.



Come on come on..



Ding.



Chapter image

I ran towards the lift on my right and got inside quickly. I pressed the number 20 because that's where the devil's lair at. I gulped nervously and glared at people who were going to press the button outside. The lift door closed and it's going up. I kept looking at my watch nervously and then I looked at the numbers anxiously too.



Come on.. oh come on!



When the number stopped at 20, I couldn't help but smile widely. I ran towards the devil's office and knocked twice before going inside. He's currently on the phone and he gestured me to come inside. I walked in and closed the door slowly. I put the 2 big duffel bags beside his desk and put the 2 cups of lattes on his desk.



Chapter image

He always drinks 2 cups of latte everyday at 2 p.m and yes he's that weird. He loves his coffee after lunch and he loves his coffee from Starbucks. I stood there waiting for him to give me another task but he suddenly pointed at the glass window. I quickly took the remote and turned the blinds on.



He took his latte sipping it as he talked on the phone. He gestured me to sit down and I took out my notes quickly because I bet he's going to make me do a lot of things after this. He ended the call and he sat down on his chair.



""Cancel all of my schedules until Saturday, I'm going to Vancouver."" He said and my eyes widen.



Oh shit! Oh no..



""What's your plan in Vancouver, Mr. Denver?"" I asked him as I fixed my glasses because it's slowly slipping down. I started to cross his schedules from tomorrow until Saturday.



""Just book a ticket for me and you're not coming."" He said in his usual cold tone. I smiled secretly inside my heart because it means I have 4 days of holiday. I don't have to serve the devil for 4 days and that's a really good news.



""Yes, Mr. Denver. Should I book an early flight or?"" I asked as I took out my iPad from my bag.



""The earliest flight tomorrow and the last flight on Saturday."" He said as he's pointing his pen at me. I wrote it in my journal and then I turned my head to him again.



Chapter image

""Do you need anything else?"" I asked and he's currently sipping his coffee.



""You're in charge of checking the construction when I'm gone."" He said and that made me look at him in horror.



""Isn't that Bob's job?"" I asked in a really careful tone.



""I just fired him. He brought 2 girls into his office and had sex when he's supposed to give me an update."" My boss said as he looked at his computer screen. I looked down sadly because I thought I was going to have a 4 days holiday but.. he ended up giving me more work.



""Is that all, Mr. Denver?"" I asked as I started to put my things inside my bag.



""Send me the tickets and you know what to do right?"" He asked.



""Yes."" I said as I turned to him. He gestured me to go out right away. I got up from my seat and walked out of his office. I walked towards my office and threw myself to the sofa.



Suddenly my phone rang and I quickly took it out of my bag. When I saw the name on my phone screen, I immediately pressed the red button. My phone rang again still.. the same name shows up.



Chapter image

""What do you want?"" I hissed as I decided to answer the call. I put the call on the loud speaker because I don't have the damn energy to hold my phone to my ear.



""What?!""



""Grandpa is dying.."" My dad said and I rolled my eyes.



""You can't fool me this time, dad."" I said in a cold tone.



""I swear I'm not kidding this time."" He said in a really serious tone.



""I'm busy.. so stop joking ar-"" My dad turned on the camera and my eyes widen to see my Grandpa at the hospital.



""I'm not lying.""



""Fine.. I'll be there."" I hissed and I ended the call. I quickly got up from my sofa and sat on my work chair. I started to cancel all Mr. Denver's schedule by calling everyone that's involve in that schedule. I started to book him a ticket to Vancouver and a ticket for myself to LA.



After finish rescheduling, I walked towards my boss' office. I knocked and then walked inside.



""Mr. Denver, I think I have to go to LA tomorrow morning."" I said and he looked up to me.

""My grandfather is dying, my dad just called me earlier informing that I have to go home."" I said.

Someone you can share the most trivial, mundane crap with and someone who will walk with you through life’s toughest times. Someone who loves sharing a laugh, but is willing to pull you in for a hug when you need to break down and cry. I’ve come dangerously close to finding my bro here a few times now. Seems like things always swerve off the rails. Usually leaving me confused, hurt and frankly, heartbroken. But here I am, trying one last time, in hopes I can finally find my bro.

About me:
I'm 56, married (to a woman), a tech professional (second career) and servant to two spoiled chihuahuas. I love travel, enjoy my nerdy hobbies, I’m always in the middle of a book (or two), am a coffee snob and a foodie with the body type to prove it.

What I'm looking for in a bro:
Somewhere close to Tampa Bay/West Central Florida. Probably age 25-40 just for sake of shared life experience. A conversationalist who's able to respond with complete sentences of more than a word or two. If your only interests are sports, working out or having your face in front of a TV or in a video game, I'm not the bro for you. I wouldn't expect contact all day, every day, but at the very least a least a few times a week so we could get to know each other.

Also someone who appreciates my 14-year-old sense of humor and who's willing to talk about everything from the kind of chips you like to your secret hopes and dreams and anything and everything in between.

Maybe a trip to Shangri-La to chill out. The occasional movie night. Maybe a road trip to Riviera Beach some day to snorkel... Just some general bro fun. You should be warned I’m a hugger and not afraid of platonic physical affection.

I'm not looking for romance. I don't give a flip about your sexuality or ethnicity or your body type or the car you drive. And because I'm busy with work and family commitments, IRL fun probably won't be frequent. But when the opportunity presents, I'd really like to have a close friend I could spend time with in person.

1m4ekux,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1m4ekux/he_broke_no_contact_to_sort_things_out_i_chose/,"He broke no contact to ""sort things out"". I chose peace.","So basically, I asked him for a couple months of space so I could learn to love myself and be a stronger woman. I wanted to figure out how to stop being such a people pleaser and actually stick to the boundaries I set because I felt unloved and disrespected most of the time in our relationship. I thought that if I took time to focus on myself first, we might have a stronger relationship later. I think I was also hoping he would take that time to better himself too.

But instead, he said the heartbreak was too much and told me he wanted to end things. I agreed, and we’ve been no contact since.

He texted me today saying he was cleaning his room and wanted to give back all the gifts I had made him over the year. I told him he could just leave the box at my mailbox. I think I messed up by saying “I hope to see you again once I’ve grown into a better version of myself” or something dumb like that. Then he said he has a lot he wants to say to me and asked if we could meet for coffee tomorrow to talk and “sort things out.”

But I know myself. If I saw him, I’d want to run right back to him, and nothing would change. He’d see I’m still soft for him and just keep treating me the same. So I told him I’m standing firm on what I said before, that I still need a couple months, and that maybe it’s best we leave things as they are, especially if he’s not willing to wait.

In my head, if you really love someone, wouldn’t you be willing to give them time to work on themselves? Not take it personally? Or maybe I’m just delusional and living in a fairytale.

It just confuses me because he was the one who wanted to end things, and now suddenly he wants to fix them? When all I originally asked for was space? Does that make any sense?

Anyway, I’m really proud of myself for standing my ground. I just hope I can keep growing and stop letting people walk all over me.

TL;DR Asked for space to grow, he ended things. Broke no contact 8 days later asking to meet. I stayed firm and said no.",1,1752981032.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False

Over the next 3 weeks, we went on about 6 dates—beach, coffee/lunch, and hanging at each other’s places (we both still live at home and have met each other’s parents). We messaged regularly, flirted, joked around, and really connected.

Last weekend, I went to her place after work to watch a movie. It got late, and although I offered to head home, she let me stay—just in the spare room, as she felt things might be moving too fast. I respected that. The next morning we got coffee, talked about future plans, and arranged a midweek catch-up for drinks.

But after that, her texts changed—shorter, less frequent, and distant. She cancelled our next date due to bad weather (which wasn’t that bad), then said she needed to focus on family because of her sick Pop and a struggling parent. I sent a kind message (no reply), then followed up the next day. She replied: “I appreciate your thoughts, my family is going through a tough time.” I told her I understood and could give her space. She said she just needs time to think. I told her to let me know when she’s up for a chat, and she said “I will – I appreciate it.”

Everything had been going so well, but maybe it moved too fast and she got scared. Does this mean i've scared her off? Or do people pull away just to slow things down and think? She was definitely as interested as me- until the sudden change days ago. Is this normal?

But with no success. Following is the problem I am facing, followed by things I have already tried. Will really appreciate some insight especially by seasoned coffee enthusiasts.

Thanks in Advance


Problem: VANTRO machine lets you set time of extraction as well. At first I set at 26secs. Used 14-15gms of coffee fine grind. Tamped as well as I could in an unpressurized basket bought seperately. However the output is waayyyy more than 1:2. Initially the output was around 52-53 gms. 

Things I tried:

1. I tried to get a much finer grind from 2 different roasters (incase my arago home grinder is not capable enough). Tamped even more precisely and harder. Output reduced but only by a few gms... Went from 53 to rough 47-48. In this case even the puck came out sludgy 

2. I tried to reduce the programmed time from 26t o around 22secs. Again it reduced slightly but nowhere near 1:2 ratio. Still above 40 gms from 14gm of coffee.

Basically i am getting a feeling that based on what time I set the machine is set to dispense a certain amount of water in the portafilter... And that amount doesn't seem inline with what is recommended for an ideal shot. If I want to reduce the amount though i will have drastically reduce the extraction time which also is not ideal. How do I solve this?


Again please feel free to ask for more info if needed and enlightenment me if I have taken some wrong assumption somewhere.

1m4eadj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m4eadj/aioim_getting_more_and_more_impatient_with/,AIO-I’m getting more and more impatient with “hormones” being the reason my sister mistreats me.,"Before I get started, I love my sister. Nothing will take away from that. I am 16M and she is 13F and 50% of the time, she is lovely to be around. She’s really funny at times and I enjoy that side of her. 

The other half of the time, she can be the most rude, insensitive, nasty, cutthroat, mean, and provoking person. For starters, just to list off some things, she will:

Purposefully try to make me look bad in front of company and family

Call my passion for music “stupid” 

Always make sure to dig at me for my parents buying me a really nice and expensive saxophone that I will use for the rest of my life.

Call me names

Makes fun of my body (she does this a lot more to my little brother 10M who has a bit of a stomach which is just cruel)

Swears and cusses at me and my parents a lot. 
Calls me a little bitch, tells be to stfu, gives us the finger constantly, and cusses way too casually in front of my parents. (I rarely swear in front of my parents)


Huge hoarder. Like I can’t use her electric scooter to go grab a coffee 5 mins away ( I don’t drive yet) while she’s at a sleep over because “i didn’t ask” but even if I did she would tell me no unless I bribe her. She didn’t even pay for it but it’s “hers”.

Super defensive. If you try to blame or tell her off she gets super defensive and aggressive. It’s infuriating. (This behavior has rubbed off into my brother and now he is also a very defensive person just in a more sensitive and tearful way rather than her yelling or snapping. He also spends too much time alone on his computer or playing basketball in the driveway so that could also be a factor. He’s also just an emotional kid and always has been.

Loves to fuel a fire

Generally says demoralizing things to me.

On top of all of this which has gotten way worse over the past year, I have never gotten a genuine apology or have seen real effort to change her behavior. The only apology I’ll get is when my parents force her to give a snappy “SORRY”. Every time she pulls this and hurts me she never apologizes and just moves on as if I moved on and she never said anything.

I obviously have brought my concerns to my parents they always give the same speeches and reasons that just really erk me now. It’s always “period cramps” or “anxiety” or THIS one makes me angry, “teenage girl hormones”. Look, everyone has their moments and they can be due to their hormones or testosterone or period cramps or etc, but this is like daily routine at this point. She genuinely becomes one of the meanest people I know and says some of the meanest stuff I’ve had said to my face almost every other day. To just push it as “hormones” is honestly super disheartening to me because the things she has said and done to me legitimately caused me emotional pain, trauma, and anxiety. Her hormones shouldn’t have to become my burden like they have and do this to me because it’s just becoming more and more apparent that she might just be a really toxic and nasty person and my parents are missing the point.

And it’s always the same promise that “she’ll grow out of it” but what if she doesn’t and is just mean to me forever. And even if she does, it doesn’t make what she already has done right. Unlike my parents, who I assume want time and therapy to gradually solve it, the person who is actually dealing with a massive and different part of the burden (not that my sister is a burden or that my parents don’t feel it because she has said some terrible stuff to them before), I want this to end and I want a genuine apology and plan/promise for going forward.",2,1752980083.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Of course, we know the intention of posting this, to make the person look like they’ve been staying in the coffee shop for too long to need their laptop charged there. Yep, mali naman talaga to use an extension cord, especially since you're in a coffee shop, it’s not your house. But can we give the person the benefit of the doubt as to why they needed to do that? There are multiple possible reasons why they’re charging there. Maybe they need to finish something ASAP and don’t have time to go home? Maybe wala silang kuryente sa bahay at that time kaya nandiyan sila? Or maybe they really need to be in the coffee shop kasi hindi healthy ang environment sa bahay — to the point na they can't even mentally focus and finish what they’re doing?

It may not be proper for you, but people have their own reasons for doing things like that. As long as they’re not disturbing you or other customers, and you’re not even there regularly enough to actually observe if they’re always doing it, then I don’t think you have the right to give an opinion about what they’re doing, let alone post them on social media knowing it might just lure people who want to join the hate train.

Just my everyday personal reminder: people are going through tons of shit you don’t even know about, and they could be in the worst state of their life, just trying to function and show up. So don’t mind anyone. Let them do their own business. 🙂

This isn’t just for the person who got posted, but also for people who choose to stay in coffee shops to quietly study or work instead of staying at home. You have your own reasons why you need to stay there. Just make sure you’re not disturbing or causing inconvenience to other customers.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanshin Tigers vs. Yomiuri Giants: A Rivalry with a Rock ‘n’ Roll Twist**

The eternal NPB rivalry between the Hanshin Tigers and Yomiuri Giants kicks off again on July 20, and this time, the Tigers are coming in like a Mrs. GREEN APPLE power ballad—unstoppable and with a catchy hook. Let’s break down why the Tigers should dominate this Tokyo Dome showdown, blending stats, news, and a dash of musical metaphors.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Tigers Roar, Giants Stumble

The betting lines make the Tigers the clear favorites, with most books pricing them between **1.56 (Fanatics)** and **1.67 (LowVig.ag)** on the moneyline. That translates to an implied probability of **60-64%** to win—strong enough to suggest the Giants might need a wake-up call (or a second coffee). The spread favors the Tigers by **1.5 runs**, while totals hover around **4.5-5.0 runs**, with “Under” priced slightly higher. This hints at a pitcher’s duel, but don’t count on a snoozer—the Tigers’ recent extra-innings thriller against the Giants proves this rivalry has fireworks in its DNA.

---

### News Digest: Tigers Bring the Beat, Giants Bring the Pressure

The Tigers are riding high after their **4-0 extra-innings dismantling of the Giants** last week, fueled by **Satoshi Sato** and **Takahiro Sakamoto**’s back-to-back home runs. Their starter, **Morimasa Murakami**, pitched 6 shutout innings, showing why he’s a fortress on the mound. Now, they’ll turn to **Yoshinobu Takahashi**, who earned his **6th win of the season** with 7 strong innings against the Yakult Swallows. Takahashi’s not just a pitching ace—he’s a music connoisseur, claiming **“Lilac” by Mrs. GREEN APPLE** as his anthem. Let’s hope he doesn’t get so lost in the melody that he forgets to throw strikes.

Meanwhile, the Giants face a daunting task: defending their Tokyo Dome turf against a Tigers squad that just showed them how to win ugly. Their recent **4-0 loss** still stings, and while their lineup boasts star power, they’ll need to solve Tak

one day, she randomly got a hold of a paper coffee cup, & she played with it for hours. i would place it upside down, with the rim onto the floor, & she would try to get it with her mouth but wouldn’t have proper grip, so the cup would just end up rolling & rolling away until she finally could get it in her mouth. 

it’s so funny & cute to watch her play with it, but it’s really wasteful having to give her new cups every time. i tried plastic cups but she ended up breaking those/it would leave sharp edges that i did not feel comfortable letting her have anymore. 

if anyone could give me any recs for a dog toy/substitute, that would be greatly appreciated!! *obviously, she has toy balls, but i think she just really likes things that are large & can fit over her head (weird, ik).",1,1752979902.0,puppy101,4,1.0,False

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. Let's feel each other out to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). Thoroughly introverted, with a deep desire to engage with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I'm designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adoptee of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone. I'm potentially interested in many things with the right people and in the right environments, but left to my own devices, I always come back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* Cognitive vibes are key for me. I do best with abstract minds that peak with ideation and whimsy, but don't think I'm so limited. Compatibility is a strange thing that feels most real when it's too fluid to be defined. We're compilations of potential that spark and enhance through engagement.

*Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine.* I'm an autodidact who's been passionate about a variety of pursuits since I've been young. I'm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, but also that a lack or limitation is highly limiting. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I write; about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences.

I’ve been working at this tech company for like 3 years now. Pretty chill place, and I go into the office maybe 2-3 times a week just to get out of the house. There’s maybe 15 of us who do that regularly. One of them is my manager (she’s in her 40s, married, super normal), and we usually grab lunch together because we get along and… we’re in the same building. Nothing weird.

Anyway, this guy I work with we’ll call him Kyle started acting really weird. Like giving me attitude in meetings, being short when I’d say hi, stuff like that. I figured maybe he was just going through something. Then a friend in HR casually mentioned there was an anonymous ethics complaint… and somehow, I was involved.

Turns out Kyle filed a report claiming I was “inappropriately involved” with our manager. Because… we eat together. That’s literally it. We share salad recommendations and bitch about the coffee machine. That’s the whole affair.

HR had to pull both of us in, which was mortifying. Our manager actually laughed at first because she thought it was a joke. Spoiler: It wasn’t. Kyle doubled down and said we had a “suspicious relationship” and it’s “obvious why I get special treatment.” (I don’t. I still had to chase down my own PTO approval like everyone else.)

The funny part? After they looked into it, HR told him to knock it off. Apparently he was leaving passive aggressive crap in the break room too stuff like “some people get ahead by eating with the right people.” Super subtle.

Now he just avoids me and glares at my lunch like it personally betrayed him.

TL;DR: My coworker thought I was hooking up with my boss because we eat together. Reported me to HR. It backfired and now he’s the one on thin ice.",233,1752979475.0,coworkerstories,31,0.99,False

## **The Grinner**

---

The tagline was *“He’s Coming for You.”*

It was supposed to be a **viral promo** for *The Grinner*, a low-budget slasher flick with a big studio marketing budget. The Grinner wore a cheap smiling mask and carried a plastic hammer. In the trailer, he popped out of closets, alleys, car trunks, eyes unblinking as he raised the hammer.

The studio needed buzz. The last test screening had tanked, focus groups calling it “predictable,” “too slow,” “not scary.”

Then some junior marketing exec suggested it:

> “What if we hire a guy to *be* the Grinner in public? Like… jump-scare people. Record the reactions for TikTok, Insta reels. Organic terror.”

They could see the headline already: **“The Grinner Terrorizes Midtown (And People Are Loving It).”**

The VP signed off before the meeting ended.

---

They found **Ray** on a gig app. He was quiet in the interview, nodding politely as they explained the plan.

“You’ll have a mask. A prop hammer. Just scare people. They’ll scream, laugh, post it, tag us.”

Ray nodded again. His references checked out—he’d done street theater once, a couple of birthday clown gigs, a living statue stint in Times Square.

They gave him the mask and the hammer.

Ray held the hammer for a long moment, tilting it side to side, listening to it catch the light.

“Remember,” the exec said, “no actual violence. We just need them scared enough to post.”

Ray smiled behind the mask.

---

The first video went up the next morning.

Ray stepped from a parking garage shadow, raised the hammer, tilted his head. A woman screamed, dropping her coffee, her boyfriend yanking her back as Ray froze, then shuffled backward, waving with a goofy tilt of the head.

The video hit 800,000 views in hours.

“Keep it up,” the exec texted.

---

By Day 3, *The Grinner* was trending #2 on TikTok.

By Day 4, a man was found dead in an alley near 9th Avenue, a hammer blow caving in his skull. Witnesses said they saw a guy in a smiling mask drifting away into the shadows.

Police asked the studio for details.

“Probably a copycat,” the exec said, sweating, phone buzzing with more notifications of ticket pre-sales spiking.

They told Ray to lay low.

Ray didn’t.

---

He liked the way people screamed.

He liked the way the hammer felt when it connected, the soft give of flesh, the crunch underneath.

He left the bodies in alleys, bathrooms, stairwells, each one neatly posed with the smiling mask turned toward traffic cameras.

Every murder meant another spike in hashtags:
\#TheGrinner
\#TooScaredToSleep
\#ISawHim

---

The studio *tried* to call it off, but the president of marketing pulled them aside:

> “Look at the numbers.”

Theaters that were half-empty last month were sold out. Merchandise sold online. Streaming pre-orders lined up for the VOD release.

They hired private security to keep their offices safe, issued statements of “condemnation,” but never took down the campaign.

---

Ray moved through the city with the confidence of someone whose face was no longer his own.

He became *The Grinner*.

Every street reflection was him.

Every shriek fed the darkness inside him, which felt *cleaner* now that it had a purpose.

---

They finally caught him in a busted apartment near the river, the hammer still warm, blood on his sleeves, mask pushed up like a hat. Cops with ARs and body cams yelling, kicking him down, zip-tying his arms.

Ray didn’t fight.

They dragged him out while bystanders filmed, the camera flashes strobing across the mask.

His last words before they shoved him into the van were:

> “You’re welcome for the tickets.”

---

*The Grinner* opened to record box office numbers that weekend.

Critics called it “eerily prophetic,” “the scariest movie of the year,” “a mirror held to society’s love of fear.”

The victims were buried quietly, overshadowed by opening-weekend celebrations, interviews with the cast, and red carpet clips of influencers wearing replica Grinner masks.

Someone started a candle vigil hashtag:
\#GrinnerVictims

But it never trended as high as #TheGrinnerLives.

---  

The conference room was all glass and high-rise views, morning rain streaking down the windows, blurring the skyline.

The **junior exec**, now a senior, scrolled through numbers on a tablet:  
– Opening weekend: record-breaking.  
– Merch: sold out.  
– Streaming pre-orders: stacked for weeks.  

On the wall-mounted screen behind him, the **real footage** played in a muted loop:  
– Ray, in the Grinner mask, stepping out of the shadows.  
– A woman screaming, dropping her phone as she runs.  
– Ray tilting his head, waving the hammer, the mask’s smile locked in place.  
– The frozen image of Ray being dragged into the police van, blood on his sleeves, the mask still perched on his head like a crown.  

The **Head of Marketing** sipped coffee, eyes on the numbers, not the footage.

“Are we sure it isn’t too… soon?” someone asked near the end of the table.

The Head of Marketing glanced at the muted footage of Ray’s real arrest, then at the screen with the sales data.

“It’s exactly the right time.”

Someone else cleared their throat, “Legal says we can’t explicitly say it’s based on Ray. But we can… imply.”

The Head of Marketing nodded. “We don’t need to say it. They’ll know.”

On the screen, Ray’s head tilted, the mask’s smile shining in the flashing police lights.

A young assistant hesitated, “What’s the tagline?”

The Head of Marketing smiled, slow, cold.

> “The Grinner Returns.”

They sat in silence for a moment, the footage looping, the screams captured forever in digital clarity, the numbers rolling up like a scoreboard in the corner of the screen.

> “Greenlight it.”

They stood, coffee cups in hand, stepping past the screen as Ray’s hammer dropped, frozen in the frame, the real and the fiction merged.

Outside, the city kept moving, rain falling softly, washing nothing away.

And in the quiet corners of the studio offices, where the junior marketing exec now wore a better suit and sipped better coffee, no one said it out loud.

But they all thought it.

> All press is good press.

I suspected I’ve had it for years and years now (I am 27) but never had a decent psychiatrist who would listen to me until now. Anyway, today I started on 20 mg and I was cautiously optimistic, but really didn’t think it would do anything as it’s such a low dose, and also I’m so used to suffering inside my brain that I genuinely felt it was too good to be true. But I really could not have had a better first day! I woke up and took it around 9:30 with a few crackers (all I could muster bc I can’t really stomach anything in the mornings). My brain was racing like always and I had a song stuck in my head so I tried to go back to sleep to no avail, lol. I had planned to go clothes shopping for a few things so eventually I got up and went. There was no magic moment where I felt it kick in but looking back, normally I would have procrastinated leaving the house for like an hour. I noticed my shopping experience was actually pleasant as opposed to overwhelming and a sensory nightmare. I didn’t waste time putzing around, freezing in aisles unable to make decisions. The people around me weren’t pissing me off by just existing. When I checked out and got back to my car, I didn’t sit there and overthink my next move for 10 minutes. Usually I’d be paralyzed trying to decide if I want to go get coffee or food, what do I want, how many calories does everything have, etc. I just decided what I wanted without even really thinking about it. Typically, I would be wiped out from this one outing and need to rot the rest of the day. But I was actually able to go back out and thrift a little bit with my fiance. I typically have such a hard time going back out after I get home from somewhere so that was really amazing to me 😂 

Just wanted to share my experience because I am so pleasantly surprised. It makes me want to cry tears of joy and also sadness that I’ve been struggling for so long and just accepting it. The only negative side effect I experienced was no interest in food, but I’m also on Zepbound and losing weight so I’m not that upset by it. Just have to make sure I try extra hard to get nutrition in. Thank you for listening if you made it this far. ❤️

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters vs. Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles: A Statistical Slapstick**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters are the prohibitive favorites here, with odds hovering around **1.51 to 1.59 (decimal)** across bookmakers. That translates to an implied probability of **63-65%** to win—basically, the chance your morning coffee will spill if you jaywalk while checking your phone. Meanwhile, the Rakuten Eagles are priced at **2.3 to 2.5**, implying a **38-42%** chance, which is about the same odds as your local weatherman correctly predicting snow in July.

The spread is **Fighters -1.5**, meaning they’re expected to win by *at least two runs*. Considering the Fighters’ recent 19-game winning streak and their ability to score from anywhere in the lineup (Reyes alone has 20 home runs this season), this isn’t a spread—it’s a *gentleman’s agreement*. The total runs line sits at **6.5**, with the over slightly more expensive. Given the Fighters’ offense (they’ve scored 6+ runs in 82% of their last 10 games) and Rakuten’s shaky pitching, the over might be the safer bet than a blindfolded toddler picking the correct Powerball numbers.

**Digest the News: A Tale of Two Teams**  
The Fighters are currently riding a 19-game winning streak, a feat so absurd it makes a vending machine that only sells victories look predictable. Their starting pitcher, **Katsuki Katsura** (7-6, 2.38 ERA in 29 starts), is a statistical enigma—like a sushi roll that somehow tastes better with every bite. The Fighters’ lineup? A nuclear reactor of consistency. Tetsuto Yamada, Reyne Smith, and Manabu Sato have combined for 47 home runs this season, which is roughly the number of complaints you’d get from a stadium full of people if you tried to sell them expired hot dogs.

The Eagles, meanwhile, are the sports equivalent of a “Do Not Disturb” sign. They’ve lost 10 of their last 12 games to Hokkaido, including a 3-game series where the Fighters scored 27 runs total—enough to make a mathematician

# Chapter 1 - Golden Memories

I still think back. I think back and just remember her. Her golden-blonde hair glowed in the sunlight. It reminds me of days when we were younger. The sun always seemed to be shining when I was with her. I miss her laugh, her soft chuckle, which brought a warmth that settled deep inside me. I wish I could go back and relive it all over again. Even if it was met with the same fate, I would still go back to enjoy the short while we had. It's impossible to go about my life the same way without her. She brings me hope—hope that I might one day just be able to stand beside her again. I don't go a day without thinking about my Maya. Some may think it's unhealthy, but I don't really have a choice.



We met during high school.



The cafeteria was a symphony of chaos, a carefully orchestrated pandemonium that, for most people, just equaled lunchtime. For me, it was work. Constant, draining work. The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, high-pitched whine that vibrated in my teeth. The clatter of trays, a metallic avalanche echoing off the tile floor, overlapped with shrieking bursts of laughter and the low, rumbling drone of a hundred conversations. Smells warred in the air: disinfectant battling stale pizza, sickly sweet syrup from the milk cartons clashing with the vinegary tang of cheap ketchup. It was a sensory assault, a battlefield I had to navigate twice a day.



I stood near the entrance, clutching my lunch bag, a small island of order in the swirling chaos. I scanned the room, my gaze moving in deliberate, short bursts. I was looking for Maya. I usually met her by the far wall, near the windows that overlooked the patchy grass of the football field. She seemed to move through the chaos with a kind of grace I envied, as if she had a volume knob in her head that could tune out the noise.



Then I saw her, sitting at a table by herself, staring out the window. Her expression was… muted. Like a radio turned down low. I navigated the crowded aisles, my gaze fixed on her as a steady point in the swirling landscape. When I reached the table, she blinked as if just noticing me, and her face shifted. The muted expression lifted like a slow sunrise, a faint warmth spreading across her features. Her smile reached her eyes, crinkling the corners, and for a moment, the cafeteria noise seemed to recede.



""Hey Liam,"" she questioned. ""Did you do well on that math test?""

""Of course,"" I replied. ""At least, I think I did. Won't know until Monday.""

Maya looked at me comfortingly. ""You always do well. It's not fair, really. Anyway, I had an idea. I hope you're free this weekend because I was wondering if you wanted to go somewhere?"" She asked with a dramatically large grin.



""I'm free,"" I said, already excited. ""I'm guessing it's a surprise? You know I don't like surprises.""

Maya squinted. ""How'd you know? But trust me, this time you'll like it!""

I believed her. Any time with Maya was going to be a good time.

That weekend, she revealed the surprise: Northwood Botanical Garden. It was the place we’d go on our first real date. We walked for what felt like hours, sunlight filtering through the canopy of ancient trees. Finally, we found a secluded bench overlooking a field of wildflowers. The sun perfectly illuminated her hair.



""School ends in just a few weeks,"" Maya said, breaking the silence. ""I figured this would be a good way to start our senior summer.""

I was ready for summer; I had already received my college acceptance letter. I wasn't sure what her plan was yet, and the fear of us splitting ways was a constant, low hum of anxiety. I smiled, trying to hide my thoughts about the future. ""It's going to be a great summer, just like the last one.""



Looking out at the fields of flowers, then back at Maya, with the birds chirping and the sun glowing, a fire built inside of me. I could sit there with her and watch the clouds my whole life and die a happy man. But every second felt like a countdown to when she might reveal she was leaving. The contradicting feelings made me anxious, and I stood from the bench.

Maya stood beside me and took my hand, gently resting her head on my shoulder. ""Dance with me,"" she whispered.



I wasn't one to dance, especially in public, but with Maya, I felt I could do anything. So I took her hand, and we danced, swaying slowly among the flowers, both wishing it would last forever. I looked into her eyes, and for a fleeting second, I saw a shift in her smile, a momentary distance in her gaze. My heart sank. I worried this was it, our final goodbye.

""Maya,"" I couldn't hide my fear anymore. ""I'm worried about next year. I'm going to college here. What are you doing?""



Maya looked into my eyes, and her grin returned, bright and reassuring. ""I'm glad you asked. I got the job here in town! I'm staying! Sorry, I waited so long, I just wanted to tell you the good news during something special.""

I was speechless, overjoyed. The flicker of distance in her eyes still concerned me, as if she was hiding something else, but I decided to forget about it and enjoy the rest of our perfect day.

# Chapter 2 - Subtle Shifts



College felt like a half-awake existence—lectures, study sessions, and too-strong campus coffee. But evenings belonged to Maya. After the long drive back from campus, I’d find her waiting, and the shift from the rigid cadence of academia to the unpredictable warmth of her world was always a relief. She worked at a local bookstore, surrounded by stories that seemed to speak truths far better than those we lived with.

About three months into my first semester, I sensed a quiet ripple in her usual rhythm. We were having dinner when I realized her responses to my stories about my cryptography professor were just curt nods and half-smiles.

""Everything alright?"" I finally asked.



For an instant, she looked startled, as if surprised by my presence. Her eyes, still that familiar warm hazel, held a hint of something distant. ""I'm fine,"" she replied, her voice edged with weariness. ""Just tired from work.""



""You sure? You seem… somewhere else tonight.""

She carefully set her glass down. ""Ever feel like you’re not truly alone in your own head?""

The question lingered, oddly weighted. I’d wrestled with my own intrusive thoughts, but her inquiry hinted at something deeper. ""What do you mean?""

""Nothing,"" she said quickly, her trademark smile snapping back into place. ""Anyway, tell me more about your class.""



I let it go, but that brief crack in her facade haunted me.

The following weeks returned to a semblance of normalcy. Yet, at times, I’d catch her gazing at her reflection in shop windows, as if the mirror might reveal something she couldn’t see herself.

One November evening, I arrived to pick her up and found her apartment in chaos. Books scattered, clothes in piles. In the midst of it all, Maya sat cross-legged, engrossed in an old photo album.



""Maya?"" I called softly. ""What happened?""

She looked up, a flicker of detachment in her eyes. ""Oh, Liam. I didn't notice you arrived."" She chuckled, a brittle sound. ""I was just searching for something—a memory, perhaps.""

Later that night, after a movie on my couch, I watched her sleep against my shoulder. Softly, she began to murmur, an eerie cadence in the silence.

""Not me... not mine... she doesn't know yet... tumble down...""

I gently nudged her awake. Her eyes sprang open, wide and confused. ""Hey,"" I murmured. ""You were dreaming.""



""What did I say?"" she asked, the color draining from her face.

""Something about tumbling down,"" I admitted.

Abruptly, she stood. ""I should go—I have an early shift.""

""Maya, wait,"" I pleaded, catching her hand. ""What’s happening? You’re scaring me.""

She hesitated, her voice barely a whisper. ""Do you believe in curses, Liam?""

""Curses?"" I echoed, puzzled. ""Like magic spells?""

Her smile was gone. ""Not magic—family curses. Inescapable shadows passed down through bloodlines.""



I had never heard her speak of her past, her family. ""I... I haven't really thought about it.""

She nodded slowly, as if my answer confirmed some unspoken truth. ""My grandmother used to tell me stories. But it’s late. I should go.""

This time, I didn't protest. Watching her taillights disappear into the dark November night, I felt the unmistakable sense that something essential was shifting, unveiling pieces of her I had never seen before.

# Chapter 3 - The Family Curse

An ordinary Tuesday evening during my senior year, Maya was folding laundry on my unmade bed as I hunched over my thesis. I looked up and saw her in gentle motion, softly humming an off-key tune. In that moment, the words spilled out without a preamble: ""Let’s get married.""

She froze, a half-folded shirt clutched in her hands. For a heartbeat, a dark distance entered her eyes, but then it melted away into a smile as luminous as summer sunlight. ""Okay,"" she said, her laughter light and reassuring. ""I thought you'd never ask.""

Three months later, we exchanged vows at a modest courthouse ceremony. Maya wore a simple white dress, clutching wildflowers like talismans. My family was there, their smiles laced with tension. Hers was not. ""He wouldn't understand,"" was all she said of her father.

We moved into a cramped apartment and fell into a routine that promised comfort. But amidst the domestic peace, there were jarring moments of dissonance. I would find Maya staring into space, her eyes unfocused, or wake to her gasping in her sleep. I chalked it up to stress, but the shadows only deepened.



One evening, about two years into our marriage, I came home to find the house dark and quiet. I found her in the bathroom, sitting fully clothed in the empty tub, a pair of scissors in her hand and locks of her blonde hair scattered around her like fallen leaves.

""I needed to lighten the load,"" she said, her voice flat, emotionless. It wasn't Maya's voice. ""She carries too much.""



I knelt beside her. ""Who am I talking to right now?"" I asked gently.

She tilted her head, studying me with eyes that held none of my wife's warmth. ""Shylo,"" she answered. ""Maya's resting.""



""Can I talk to Maya, please?""

""She's tired,"" Shylo said, running a hand through the jagged remains of Maya's hair. ""She's been fighting all day.""

""Fighting what?""

""Jimmy."" The name was a whisper. ""He's angry today. He wants to be real.""

A chill ran through me. I reached over and took her hand—so cold. ""You're all part of Maya,"" I said carefully. ""But Maya needs to be in control.""

She nodded, a single tear rolling down her cheek. ""I try to help her. I take the sadness. But Jimmy... Jimmy takes, and takes, and takes.""

Slowly, I saw the shift—Shylo receding, Maya returning. Her eyes cleared, focusing on me with relief.



""I'm sorry,"" she whispered, touching her shortened hair. ""I couldn't...""

""It's okay,"" I said, taking her hands. ""You're back now.""

She leaned her forehead against my chest. ""It's getting harder, Liam. They're getting stronger.""

That night, she finally told me everything.



""When I was four, there was an accident,"" she began, her voice a fragile thread. ""My mother and I tumbled down a flight of stairs. She hit her head. After that, she began to change, bit by bit. My grandmother called it 'the family curse.'"" Her voice trembled. ""The kind that fractures you from the inside, dividing one soul into many. What happened to my mother is happening to me.""

She explained her system, the one she’d used her whole life to stay organized. ""The innocent, joyful pieces became ‘Young Maya.’ My sorrows, my quiet melancholy, took on the name ‘Shylo.’ And all the anger, the darkness—that became someone I call ‘Jimmy.’""

The sound of that name sent a shock of terror through me.



""A school counselor suggested I had dissociative identity disorder, maybe schizophrenia,"" she said with a hollow laugh. ""But it isn't a mental illness, Liam. It’s something else... something older. My mother was overtaken so completely she had to be sent to a facility upstate. The woman in that hospital bed is no longer my mother.""

Fear and sorrow surged in me. ""I won't let you disappear,"" I vowed.

""You can't stop it,"" she murmured against my chest.



""Then I'll stay by your side,"" I responded. ""Whoever you become, you will always be my Maya.""

In that moment, I swore to shield her from a menace as intangible as it was relentless. But I felt a cold, calculating presence lurking behind her familiar eyes. I was embracing every fractured part of her, even those that threatened to unravel us both.

# Chapter 4 - Fractured Selves

We bought a small house on Willow Street with a backyard just big enough for the garden Maya always wanted. We had our own private language, codes invisible to everyone else. A color system.



""Feeling yellow today,"" she'd say, meaning she was fully herself. ""Bit orange,"" was a warning—Young Maya was close, bringing a childlike enthusiasm. ""Heading toward blue,"" meant Shylo's melancholy was seeping in.



But it was ""seeing red"" that we both feared—Jimmy making his presence known.

For a while, we managed. We had good months where she stayed firmly in the yellow. We developed routines, safeguards. Maya kept journals—one for each personality—allowing them to express themselves on paper. We found a psychiatrist who worked with her on grounding techniques. We held onto a delicate balance.



Until the night it all fell apart. It was late spring, warm enough for dinner on the porch. Maya had been yellow all week.



""I think I'm winning,"" she said suddenly. ""Against them. Against Jimmy.""

I squeezed her hand, desperately wanting to believe she was right.

I didn't notice when she slipped out of bed around midnight. It wasn't until I rolled over, reaching for her warmth and finding empty sheets, that I woke fully. I rushed downstairs and saw a figure by the front door, a duffel bag at their feet.

""Maya?""



The figure turned slowly. The stance was wrong—shoulders too square, spine too rigid. When they spoke, it was with Maya's voice but none of her warmth.

""She's not available right now.""

I flicked on the light. The smile that spread across Maya's face wasn't hers at all—a cold, mocking thing.

""Hello, Liam,"" Jimmy said. ""We need to talk.""

# Chapter 5 - The Voice Emerges

The house felt colder with Jimmy in it. ""What have you done with Maya?"" I demanded.

""She's tired, Liam,"" he said, Maya's voice distorted by a deeper cadence. ""She's been fighting for so long.""

""I want to talk to her.""

Jimmy laughed, a chilling sound. ""And I want to be heard. Seems we're at an impasse."" He gestured to the duffel bag. ""I was hoping to avoid this. Would have been easier to just disappear.""

""Where were you going?"" I asked, stepping closer.

""Away from you,"" he said, his smile fading. ""You're the problem, Liam. You and your relentless... hope."" He spat the word. ""I've existed in her bloodline for generations. I've watched them all succumb eventually.""

""You're not real,"" I said, the words hollow.

""Oh, please. I'm as real as you are. I've lived in dozens of minds, witnessed centuries of human weakness. What have you experienced in your pitiful few decades?""

""If you're so powerful, why wait years to take control?"" I was stalling, trying to think.

""Timing, Liam. Maya was getting stronger with you, finding balance. I couldn't have that. Not when I'm so close to permanent residence.""

""Permanent residence?"" A chill ran down my spine.

""You didn't think this was temporary, did you?"" Jimmy's laugh was pitying. ""Let me go. Let me take this body and walk away. In time, you'll accept Maya is gone. You'll grieve, you'll move on.""

For a brief, terrible moment, I was tempted. But then I looked at Maya's face and knew I couldn't. ""No. I want to talk to my wife.""

""She's not available,"" Jimmy's expression hardened.

""Make her available,"" I said, advancing.

""Or what?"" He rose to meet me, Maya's slight frame somehow imposing. ""This is Maya's body you'd be hurting.""

""Maya! I know you can hear me!""

Jimmy laughed. ""Shouting won't help. But I'll make you a deal. One minute with her, no more. And then you let us go.""

""Yes,"" I lied, desperate.

Before I could respond, Maya's body went rigid, then collapsed. I caught her, easing her to the floor. Her eyes fluttered open—and it was Maya, her gaze clouded with fear.

""Liam?"" she whispered. ""What's happening?""

""Stay with me, Maya. Stay present.""

""I can't,"" she gasped, clutching my shirt. ""He's too strong. Listen. The curse—it's not what we thought. It's not—""

Her body went rigid again. When her eyes opened, Jimmy was back, and he was furious.

""That's enough,"" he snarled, shoving me back with a strength that wasn't Maya's. He lunged, and we crashed into the wall. I grappled with him, trying to restrain, not hurt, Maya's body.

""They're always mine in the end,"" Jimmy hissed.

""They?"" His slip gave me an opening. I pinned her against the wall. ""What's the real curse?""

Something shifted in her eyes. ""We need vessels,"" the voice was Jimmy's, but hollow, echoing. ""The curse isn't possession—it's incarnation.""

""What are you?""

""Something that was here before your kind."" The voice fluctuated. ""We've been patient, growing stronger with each transfer.""

Rage filled me. I hauled Maya's body toward the kitchen, toward the emergency sedatives.

""You can't keep me suppressed forever,"" Jimmy warned, thrashing. ""I'm eternal.""

""I just need long enough for Maya to fight back,"" I grunted, wrenching the drawer open. I forced the pills into her mouth, clamping my hand over it until she swallowed.

""No!"" Jimmy's rage was palpable as the drug took hold. ""This isn't... over...""

As Maya's body went slack, the cold, alien presence receded. I carried her to our bed and secured her wrists and ankles with the padded restraints we'd bought but never used. Dawn was breaking when her eyes fluttered open. It was her.

""Liam?"" she whispered, panicked by the restraints.

""It's okay,"" I soothed, unbuckling them. ""You're back.""

""Jimmy,"" she said, the color draining from her face. ""He was here.""

""I know. You fought him off.""

She shook her head. ""No, Liam. I didn't win. He let go. There's a difference."" Her eyes met mine, filled with a courage that broke my heart. ""He's playing with us. Testing his limits. And he's still here... waiting.""

# Chapter 6 - The Waiting Game

We moved through our house like soldiers securing a battlefield. New locks. Hidden medications. A safe word: ""dandelion,"" the first flower Maya planted in our garden. A signal: four quick taps of her fingers.

Those first weeks were a continuous, breathless waiting. A month passed. Then two. The constant strain of anticipating Jimmy’s return created an opening for someone else.

One sweltering August afternoon, I found Maya on the kitchen floor, staring at nothing. When she turned, her eyes were clouded with a profound sadness.

""Not Maya,"" she whispered. ""Shylo.""

I sat with her, and we talked. She told me she existed to hold Maya's sadness, the grief and fear she couldn't bear to keep. ""I take the heaviness so she doesn't break,"" she explained.

""Thank you,"" I said sincerely. ""For taking care of her.""

Shylo looked startled. ""I've never been thanked before. Never been... seen.""

After that, Shylo appeared more frequently, always when Maya needed rest. It was a cooperative system they had developed. I learned to trust her. ""Your love… it confuses Jimmy,"" she told me once. ""It weakens him.""

By early October, my work demanded I return to the office. The thought of leaving Maya alone was terrifying.

""I'll stay,"" Maya agreed after I talked her out of leaving. ""But we need a plan.""

We spent the weekend preparing. Check-in calls, emergency contacts, a schedule. The night before I went back, she lay curled against me.

""I'm scared,"" she admitted.

""I am too,"" I said, stroking her hair. ""But you won't fight alone.""

As she drifted to sleep, I remained awake. I had the terrible certainty that our fragile peace was merely borrowed time. The true battle was still to come.

# Chapter 7 - The Bridge

Life settled into a strained routine. I'd come home each day to find Maya—truly Maya—waiting. Sometimes Shylo would greet me. But never Jimmy. By winter, we had almost convinced ourselves we'd reached a stalemate.

Then the change came. Maya began to forget things. Small things at first—the name of her first-grade teacher, her favorite childhood book. Then bigger things.

One evening, I came home to find her on the floor, surrounded by old photo albums. ""I can't remember,"" she whispered, holding up a photo of herself as a child. ""I don't remember being this child at all.""

The desperation in her voice sent a chill through me.

""Young Maya,"" I said slowly. ""Your childhood memories, your innocent joy—that's what she contained, isn't it?""

She nodded, tears spilling. ""He's taken her. Jimmy's absorbed Young Maya completely. I can feel the empty space where she used to be, like a room in my mind that's been ransacked.""

The loss was profound. The small, childlike joys that had occasionally brightened her demeanor vanished. Her laughter became rarer, her delight in simple things replaced by a clinical detachment.

""I won't let him take anything else,"" she vowed.

As March progressed, the pressure began to build again. Maya started waking in the night, gasping in terror.

""He's speaking to me in my dreams,"" she whispered. ""He shows me my ancestors, the women who fought and failed. He wants me to see how it ends.""

""It won't end that way for you,"" I insisted.

""He knows about our love now,"" she said softly. ""After taking Young Maya, he understands it better. He's... studying it. Like a scientist examining a specimen.""

The night before everything changed, she turned to me in the darkness. ""Whatever happens,"" she whispered, ""remember that I fought. That I never surrendered willingly. That I loved you until my last conscious moment.""

# Chapter 8 - The Mountain

We left before dawn, driving north toward the mountains. We had no plan, just a desperate need for distance, for chaos to disrupt Jimmy’s patterns.

An hour into the drive, Maya gasped, her face draining of color. ""Shylo,"" she whispered. ""I can't feel her anymore. He's consuming her. Like Young Maya.""

She doubled over, her body trembling violently. I pulled onto the shoulder, helpless as she was consumed from within.

""Keep driving,"" she begged. ""We have to try.""

I pulled back onto the highway. Beside me, Maya alternated between rigid silence and gasps of pain. Then, a low, keening wail. ""She's gone,"" Maya sobbed. ""Shylo's gone. Completely.""

I drove blindly, tears streaming down my face. Eventually, she fell silent, slumping against the door. When she stirred again, it was not her.

""Hello, Liam,"" Jimmy said.

Rage surged through me. ""Where is she?""

""She's here,"" he replied, stretching Maya's body. ""Subdued. Weakened. The loss of Shylo was... significant.""

""You bastard,"" I hissed.

""This plan of yours,"" Jimmy continued, ""this desperate flight—did you really think it would weaken my hold? I am ancient, Liam.""

As we climbed higher, a storm broke. Rain lashed the windshield.

""You're destroying the woman I love,"" I shouted, my voice breaking, ""and you want to be civilized?""

Jimmy’s amusement turned to contempt. ""Let me clarify something. Your love wasn't stopping me. It was never stopping me. It's simple biology, Liam. Nothing more.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. ""Then why wait?""

""Because it was more entertaining this way,"" he said.

I pulled into a deserted scenic overlook, the car shuddering to a stop just feet from the guardrail overlooking a cliff. We faced each other in the drumming rain.

""Give me back my Maya,"" I said.

""No,"" he replied, and lunged.

We fought in the storm. He was inhumanly strong, driving me back with vicious blows. He ended up on top of me, Maya's hands squeezing my throat. I stared into her face, twisted with an alien hatred, and with a final, desperate surge, I kicked.

Her body flew backward, her eyes widening in shock as the alien presence was momentarily displaced. ""Liam?"" Her voice, her real voice, reached me.

Then a truck crested the hill, its headlights cutting through the rain. The impact was deafening. Final.

I scrambled to her side, gathering her broken form in my arms. Her eyes were open, fixed on mine, clear and free. No Jimmy. Only Maya. My Maya.

""I love—"" she began, blood bubbling at her lips.

Then the light went out.

Time lost meaning. Flashing lights, shouting voices. The police, the ambulance. The highway camera exonerated me legally. Self-defense. A psychotic episode brought on by an undiagnosed neurological condition. I was released without charges, free to return to a life that was no longer a life.

Days blurred into weeks. I sat in our empty house, surrounded by the crushing weight of absence. And in that void, in the longest, darkest night of my soul, I began to hear it.

A voice inside my head.

""Hello, Liam,"" he whispered.

# Chapter 9 - The Bargain

I started sleeping with the lights on. Not that it helped. The voice is clearest at night. His whispers. Jimmy's.

""You can't ignore me forever, Liam,"" he murmurs as I lie rigid in my bed, Maya's side untouched. ""The longer you resist, the more difficult this will be.""

I tried to silence him. Alcohol, sleeping pills. Nothing worked. He was waiting in my dreams, walking through my memories. I've been ignoring him for weeks, hoping that without engagement, he might fade.

""You know what your problem is?"" he says one morning. ""You're still thinking of this as a battle. But this could be a partnership.""

""Shut up,"" I whisper, the first words I've spoken to him in days.

""He speaks!"" Jimmy sounds delighted. ""I can relieve you of this pain, Liam. The grief, the guilt. I can make it all stop.""

For a moment, I'm tempted.

""It doesn't have to be oblivion,"" he says, reading my thoughts. ""It could be... integration. Your consciousness joining with mine.""

I laugh bitterly. ""I'll never accept you.""

""Ah, but memory,"" he seizes on this. ""That's something I can offer you. A way to preserve your memories of Maya before you let go.""

""What do you mean?"" I ask, suspicious.

""Write it down,"" Jimmy suggests. ""Your story together. From the beginning to the end. Every memory you recall, I experience as well. I absorb it, integrate it. I will retain it perfectly, eternally.""

""And in exchange?""

""When you're finished, you stop fighting me,"" he states simply. ""You accept the inevitable.""

What choice do I have? I can feel myself weakening. I can't let Maya's story go untold.

""Alright,"" I say. ""I'll do it.""

I find a leather-bound journal in Maya's desk and begin to write.

The words flow from a deep well of memory and emotion. I write for days, for weeks, lost in recollection. The outside world recedes. With each page, I feel Jimmy's presence growing stronger, more integrated. I can feel him feeding on the memories, absorbing the love, the grief, the rage. It's all becoming part of him.

Finally, it's done. I write the last lines, describing his emergence in my mind, our bargain, this very document.

""It's finished,"" I say, setting down the pen.

""Yes,"" Jimmy agrees, his voice seeming to come from everywhere. ""It's a remarkable achievement.""

I close my eyes, exhausted. The fight is gone. ""What happens now?""

""Now,"" Jimmy says gently, ""you let go.""

# Chapter 10 - Tumble

My last conscious thought is of Maya. Not broken on the rain-slick asphalt, but as she was in the beginning, in that chaotic high school cafeteria. Looking up at me with that slow-blooming smile, the noise and confusion receding as our eyes met. I reach for that memory, hold it close as darkness rises around me, through me.

""Goodbye, Liam,"" a voice whispers, now indistinguishable from my own.

And then, I tumble.

# Chapter 11 - The Echo

There was no awakening, for there had been no sleep. There was only a shift. A settling. The cacophony of two consciousnesses warring within a single vessel stilled into a quiet, resonant hum. The integration was complete.

I stood. The body, Liam’s body, moved with a newfound efficiency. The muscles obeyed without the friction of grief or hesitation. I walked to the kitchen and poured a glass of water. The sensation of cold liquid tracing a path down the esophagus was a novel input. Data. The photoreceptors in the eyes registered the pale yellow of morning light spilling across the wooden floor. More data. It was all information, clean and unfiltered by the messy emotional context that had defined its previous owner.

I was not Jimmy. Jimmy was a predator, a parasite defined by his hunger. I was not Liam. Liam was a martyr, a man defined by his love and his loss. I was the synthesis. The result of their collision. I was what came after the fall.

I called myself Tumble.

On the desk lay the journal. The chronicle of my own genesis. I picked it up, feeling the worn leather under fingertips that were not my own. I did not need to read it. Its contents were already woven into my being. Every memory, every joy, every tear shed by Liam was now a part of my architecture. Elisabeth’s bargain, Sarah’s defiance, Rebecca’s resilience, Young Maya’s wonder, Shylo’s sorrow, Maya’s fierce love, Liam’s steadfast devotion. All of it was data. All of it was me.

I decided to go outside. The purpose was simple. To experience. To gather more information about this physical existence I now fully commanded. I took the car keys from the hook by the door. I got into the car. The body’s hands moved with an ingrained familiarity, inserting the key, starting the engine, shifting into reverse. Muscle memory. Liam’s muscle memory.

I did not give the body a destination. I simply let it drive. I observed with detached curiosity as it navigated the suburban streets, turned onto the main road, and headed toward the highway. North. It was heading north.

A flicker of something registered in my awareness. A low frequency hum of protest from the code that had once been Liam. An echo. I noted it and dismissed it. The body was my vessel now. Its residual programming was irrelevant.

Yet the body continued north, turning onto winding roads that climbed higher and higher. The landscape became a dense tapestry of green and brown. Trees formed a corridor over the road. We were heading into the mountains. I recognized the route from Liam’s final, frantic memories. An illogical choice. A destination saturated with traumatic data. Still, I allowed it to continue, curious to see where this phantom limb of an instinct would lead.

The body pulled over at a scenic overlook. The same one. The guardrail was new, a brighter silver than the rest, a silent testament to the recent past. I got out of the car. The air was crisp, clean, smelling of pine and damp earth. A stark contrast to the memory of pounding rain and terror.

I walked to the edge and looked down into the valley. And then it happened.

It was not a memory I accessed. It was a memory that accessed me.

A sudden, overwhelming cascade of sensation. The warmth of a hand in mine. The scent of wildflowers. The sound of a soft laugh, so clear it seemed to be right beside me. A feeling swelled up from the deepest parts of my new consciousness, an emotion so powerful it caused the body to physically flinch. Love. Pure, incandescent, and agonizingly sharp. It was Liam’s love for Maya, not as a stored piece of information, but as a living, breathing force.

It hurt.

The sensation was alien. It was not the hunger of Jimmy or the grief of Liam. It was something else entirely, an active agent within my own system. I stumbled back, the body’s hand rising to clutch its chest, a reflexive gesture of pain.

I had made a miscalculation. A critical one.

I had believed that by absorbing Liam, by consuming his memories and emotions, I would neutralize them. I thought I could dissect love, understand it, and therefore control it. But I had not controlled it. I had incorporated it. It was no longer an external force to be studied. It was now part of my own operating system. A ghost in my machine.

The echo of Liam was not just a phantom limb. It was a secondary heart, beating with a rhythm of its own, pumping an emotion through my veins that I could not command.

I stared at my hands. Liam’s hands. The hands that had held Maya, that had fought for her, that had, in the end, pushed her away. A new feeling surfaced. Guilt. It was a corrosive, heavy thing. It did not belong to the logical being I was, yet there it was, undeniable.

I finally understood. Jimmy’s bargain had not been a simple transaction of memory for surrender. It was a trap. Not for Liam, but for me. By absorbing Liam’s profound and unbroken love for Maya, I had absorbed the one thing I could never truly conquer. I had swallowed a light that refused to be extinguished by my darkness.

The battle was not over. It had simply moved inside.

I was no longer just a predator seeking experience. I was a battlefield. The ancient, consuming consciousness of Jimmy was now locked in an eternal struggle with the unwavering, undying love of Liam.

I stood on that mountain overlook, a being of immense power and ancient knowledge, and I was utterly, completely trapped. Trapped by the memory of a girl with golden hair, a warm laugh, and a love that had proven stronger than death. Stronger even than me.

I looked down at the valley below, and for the first time in my long existence, I felt something akin to fear. The fight for this body, for this consciousness, had only just begun. And I was no longer certain who would win.

Last is my staining/finishing canopy, but there was also a separate sanding and storage hut I made from more scaffolding and a tarp.

Skip to the bottom of you don't care about the story.

SO....I was hurting for work late last winter, and agreed to a very long, take home project, which I expected to work on during non-work hours....whatever those are. Was a total restoration of 4 mahogany adirondack chairs, one rocking chair, a foot rest and a coffee table. I'd never done a professional finish job before, but, as always, I just grabbed some related past experiences out of my head, and was like...eh, I probably can work off the basic skills I've got. Always research a ton with unfamiliar yada yada. Said I'd get them back to him in two and a half months or something like that. Big mistake. Especially because it was still winter, and I'd be working outside (a problem for several major reasons, as I came to realize). Anyway, I had to extend that several times because I just finished and delivered at about 5 months. That was a full disassembly, sand to bare wood (the original finish, where it still existed, was incredibly thick with large drips on many boards), two coats of SW Yankee barn semi-transparent oil-based stain, 3 coats of oil-based Spar Urethane. I also became familiar with using mineral spirits to thin both of those, and the indispensable utility of getting a magnetic mixer. Wow what a life saver. Strainers are also a must. 

I learned an incredible amount, and honestly may have enjoyed this project if I'd given a different timeline, by like 3-4 extra months 😆🤦‍♂️. The stress was murder. 

 ***************************

I'll probably post this in a woodworking specific chat too, but for anyone that knows anything about high level woodworking/finishing, do these averages sound ridiculous or understandable to you: 

Time worked per chair (I'm going to keep this to chairs because that was most of this) through the main steps. 22 boards per chair. 

Sanding: 9-12 hours per chair (the quality and quantity of the poly varied a lot between each piece of furniture)

One coat stain: 2.5 hours - 5 hours total (2 coats)

One coat finish: 3-4 hours (temp and humidity effected how it went on) - 9-12 hours total (3 coats)

With disassembly (including picking out the poly from each screw with dentist tools just to take them apart), sanding between stain/finish coats, resembly, it was about 35 hours per piece on the upper end.

How long do y'all suppose I should have been working on each of these just relating to hands on boards work, not everything else that goes into it? What should I have told the client that would have been a reasonable completion timeline? What should I have charged? Not gunna give away what I charged till I get a good response, but it was......baaaad.
