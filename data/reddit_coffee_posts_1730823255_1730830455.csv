1gkd5gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gkd5gw/my_best_friend_betrayed_and_ghosted_me/,My best friend betrayed and ghosted me ,"First post on Reddit! So, here we go 
I (23f) and my ex best friend (22f) were best friends. We were together almost every day. We go to the same uni and also we have very much in common. Then she got a bf. We started seeing less and less. I understood that because yk I have a bf myself and ofc it was normal. A backed off after a couple of dodged suggestions to go out. After a couple of months she fr started to not chat with my nor anything. I was like ok normal I will give her space. Soon after we all each other near my house. She was crying because she and her bf were in a fight and it was ugly and toxic and he went out to his ex because they are still friends (his saying) my friend was a mess and I tried everything to calm her down she relaxed then went out separate ways. That situation then happened every time I saw her. Nothing more. I tried to help her. They needed to break up fr. But I saw deep down she doesn’t want to break up. Defeated I distanced myself still I suggested every now and then to grab a coffee or just something because after all she lives 10min from my house. I decided to have a serious conversation about how I felt about all that. And she just kind of stoped giving I shit about our friendship. We were friends of 8y. I was there by her side every day. Emotionally even financially sometimes. I can’t accept it smh. I’m depressed. Idk what to do. Why does she doesn’t care after so many years of us being friends. She and her bf are still together they are even physically fighting sometimes. Shit is tough. And at this point they were a year and a half together. Situation is the same with them. We are not friends and I’m lost. If u have some advice. Let me know. ",1,1730830231.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Put me in a coffee shop with good smells, people going in and out, and a view of town, and ***bam*** so much done. I need to be connected to the real world.

Home is like a dark hole even though I love my home. I think being stuck there for too long and the silence becomes consuming, much like my childhood home. Endless days of nothingness. Excessive daydreaming out of boredom to try and disassociate away from the void of numb reality.",1,1730830205.0,HomeschoolRecovery,1,1.0,False

1gkd2x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianAmericanIssues/comments/1gkd2x7/video_how_to_overcome_approach_anxiety_7_beginner/,[VIDEO] How To Overcome Approach Anxiety (7 Beginner Level Techniques),"As Asian men, a lot of us know that approach anxiety isn’t **just** about the fear of talking to someone new—it’s can also include the cultural and social pressures we carry, too. Maybe you’ve felt the extra layer of nerves because of stereotypes or assumptions about how “approachable” we are (or aren’t) or how receptive she is (or not) to us as men of color. 

The truth is, approaching and connecting with women isn’t just for the “natural” extroverts or guys without insecurities. It’s a skill you can learn, and it’s one that can build confidence in all areas of your life.

Here are **7 beginner level tips** that can help you push through approach anxiety and start feeling genuinely comfortable connecting with others:

1. **Start Small and Build Up** Don’t try to go from zero to approaching the most attractive woman in the room right away. Start by talking to anyone around you—whether it’s the cashier, barista, or even someone you pass in the grocery store. This isn’t about flirting or “picking up”—it’s about getting comfortable with initiating conversations. The more you do it, the more natural it becomes.
2. **Desensitize Yourself to Your Environment** Spend time in places where you’d like to meet people—cafes, parks, bookstores. Familiarity reduces anxiety because you start feeling like you belong there. If you know a spot where you can get comfortable, keep going back until it feels like home base. Feeling at ease in a place helps you feel more in control and reduces that nervous “outsider” feeling.
3. **Use Simple, Observational Openers** Instead of stressing over a “perfect line,” make a comment about something around you. Say, “Hey, that book looks interesting, what’s it about?” or “You seem like a coffee expert—what did you order?” These openers are low-pressure, genuine, and allow the other person to open up naturally. For Asian men, observational openers also help sidestep any cultural stereotype that we’re shy or too formal, by keeping things light and easy.
4. **Apply the 3-Second Rule** When you see someone you want to talk to, count to three and go for it. The longer you wait, the more your brain will come up with reasons to hold back. This rule helps you stop overthinking and makes you feel more decisive. It’s a powerful technique for stopping that self-doubt spiral we sometimes fall into.
5. **Get Comfortable with Rejection** Rejection is part of the process, and honestly, it’s a good thing. Every time you face rejection, you’re getting more resilient. Remember, she’s not rejecting *you* personally—she’s just not interested right then. Taking rejection less personally can be especially helpful for Asian guys, since we often feel like there’s extra pressure to prove ourselves. Shake it off, and move on. Every interaction is practice.
6. **Visualize Success** Spend a few minutes every day imagining yourself having positive, relaxed conversations with people. Visualizing successful interactions helps “rewire” your mind to expect good outcomes. This is a useful mental exercise to overcome that extra cultural baggage and self-doubt that can hold us back. When you’re used to picturing success, it feels less scary to make it happen in real life.
7. **Celebrate Small Wins** Don’t measure your success only by numbers or dates. Give yourself credit for taking action, even if it didn’t go perfectly. Every time you step out of your comfort zone, you’re winning. Asian guys often feel like we have to reach some high bar to feel “worthy.” But the truth is, progress itself is success. Recognize each step forward, and confidence will come more naturally.

These steps won’t erase approach anxiety overnight, but they’ll help you make real progress and build confidence over time. If you want to dive deeper with examples and explanations, check out the full video [here](https://youtu.be/UcKN1WgMU6w).

All of this led to a colonoscopy, protonix, mesalamine, and an iron pill every day. The cost of insurance is crazy, and the cost of prescriptions. Ive smoked marijuana all my life. I am 35 years old. I quit at 30 and developed the UC at 32. I starting using marijuana again to ease the symptoms of the UC and it was a miracle almost. I couldn't afford to keep paying for the insurance and the meds every month so i stopped. Cold turkey. I smoke weed everyday im not saying its the weed but it could be. My poop has never looked better. I drink coffee and eat pretty much whatever i want. I avoid straight milk and ice cream and nuts or seeds and heavy amounts  of red meat. No blood in poop for almost a year now. If i get more financially stable ill get checked out. However i feel great and poop looks good. Stomach is ok also. Cheers to this lasting for good and was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience. I know this thing could strike back anytime but ive been good for awhile just wanted some feedback.",0,1730829921.0,UlcerativeColitis,1,0.33,False

Our name is Galeforce, and we've recently started playing the Blue Lions route of Three Houses. We hadn't been playing Three Houses since our unfinished chapter 15 Crimson Flower playthrough (we got interested in another game at the time, I believe? I don't know. I have no idea.), but we still remember perfectly as to what roles each Black Eagle plays in the team.

  
However, we have NO fucking clue as to what to do with the Blue Lions. Why are they all lances? Are we stupid? (Potentially). Do I pick up skills in other classes and reclass back to a main one? Why is Three Houses's class system so open? (We've almost finished a run of Awakening)  
  
Why am I barely invested in any of my BL students, when I cared so much about the Black Eagles even before my first run? I like Felix because he was the only one who survived the mock battle, but that's essentially it so far. I assume I'll like them more once I do more supports, but... haaah.

Essentially: HELP! My ass is NOT invested in the Blue Lions and every time I boot up my file I think about how much I really really really wanna be playing Black Eagles instead. And also, what roles do the Blue Lions generally fulfil? From what I can tell it's like -   
  
Dimitri (Unique Class), Dedue (Heavy armoured Unit or Maybe an Axe-Centered Class?), Ashe (Archer), Annette (APPARENTLY REASON?????), Mercedes (Healer though she's so squishy that she dies whenever I breathe on her), Sylvain (Paladin), Ingrid (Peg???? Knight?????? Or Paladin??), and I think there's a few other people in the house but I can't remember.

I’ve also gotten addicted to a vape so now I’m hooked on the nicotine. Coffee as well. I don’t sleep well. 

I also accidentally fell in love with a summer fling and had a MASSIVE and embarrassing crash out (think bombarding her with texts) after she essentially ghosted me.

My life is fine - the issue is I can’t sleep well. I want to get off the nicotine and caffeine ASAP. I also need my nervous system to reach equilibrium again. What can I do

I have a few new girls I’m texting but I can’t go on dates feeling like this. I already have a date scheduled for tomorrow but I know I won’t be in the right state of mind to be “fun”. I can’t reschedule to next week because I already rescheduled. Anything I can take to speed up the process? I can quit caffeine and nicotine cold Turkey the issue is the brain fog and headaches will last for days.

1gkctre,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1gkctre/im_a_corporate_exec_and_a_burner_im_not/,I’m a corporate exec and a burner. I’m not contributing to Marian’s ask for “gift” donations (brain dump in the body),"
 
I’ll start off by saying I love Burning Man since my first burn back in 2014. Ever since then, I constantly talk to everyone about that magical place where if you take away a lot of societal constructs… people are actually awesome.

I have been a corporate executive for several years in for-profit companies. And despite of stark differences on how for-profit and non for-profit organizations work - at the core there are commonalities like a mission, constraints, and results.  Getting to the point, based on my experience, I don’t believe Marian Goodell is a good CEO. 

2024 was the first year since 2011 that Burning man didn’t sell out; and shortly after that we have been getting pleas for donations. If you have ever worked for tips, sales commissions, or owned your own business you know very well that you can’t make plans for the year based on your take home from your best night, week, or month… it is simply absurd. This shows that Marian has been an adequate CEO in times of abundance, but she simply lacks the skills to lead in difficult times. I find it disrespectful towards the burner community to ask for “gifts” invoking the principles. The financial impact that this recurrent “gift” would have in the numbers provided wouldn’t close the financial gap disclosed; so what is going to happen when they realize that they’ll still come short? How are the burners who are naive enough to donate going to feel that their $20 subscription not only will not get them anything, and will probably be slapped on the face with higher ticket prices?  How many more burners are going to be priced out of Burning Man in addition to all the ones who already haven’t been able to afford to attend?

Many burners have pointed out that The Burning Man Org hasn’t been the most diligent to make sure that the initiatives and projects they sponsor make proper use of those funds. Many others have been spot on to highlight that Burning Man is supporting a wide variety of initiatives in a lot of places. Anyone in a leadership role knows that in times of adversity you need to scale back, cut costs, and go down to the core things that stick closest to the mission. I find it hilarious that Marian is justifying her pleas for help to keep everything going invoking yet again the mission and the principles; I find it disturbing that the board of directors are allowing all of this to happen. It is their job to hire and fire the CEO, they should look for a competent leader.

A large number of burners have said she should take a pay cut. I will respectfully disagree and I would argue that a $300K - $400K CEO is actually quite cheap in the U.S.… you get what you pay for, and it shows. I’m not going to justify the opposite end where CEOs make absurd amounts of money which is equally terrible - the board should really look into bringing someone who has a track record of turning failing organizations around.

I lead based on a few philosophical principles, two of which are “The only constant is change”, and “What got us here is not what will get us there”. As the world spins it brings change and Burning Man is no exception, hence the burner saying “it was better last year”. Burning Man started in the 80s when a group of people gathered on a beach in San Francisco to express themselves - never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined what it would become in the following decades. Imagine telling one of those first burners in the 80’s that Burning Man would have an airport, an ice shop, its own marathon, and that it would cost $575 to buy a ticket. Burning Man has changed and will continue to change and that’s inevitable.  In 2020 Burning Man was cancelled because of the pandemic, yet a group of dedicated, and brave burners met up at the playa and made the best with what they had, no porta potties, no coffee shop, no trash fence; in my opinion they had the closest experience of what burning man was back on that beach in the 80’s and experienced the principles in their most pure form. So a valid question to ask is, do we need the formal Black Rock City to keep the burning man principles alive?  

The talent, ideas, strategies, and efforts that took the principles from that gathering on the beach to modern day Black Rock City had to be constantly evolving to solve countless problems - a testament of resilience, creativity, and determination. Burning Man has the opportunity to really push itself and embrace “Radical evolution” to change the way it operates so that it can continue to exist. “What got us here is not what will get us there” 

Burning Man is one of the best in the world at organizing events. They could easily spin off for profit production houses and donate their revenue toward the nonprofit arm. This is legal and done all the time in the U.S. following strict yet clear rules. This is a common practice amongst nonprofits as ways to secure funding such as The National Geographic Society who operates a for-profit media arm, National Geographic Partners, which includes its magazine, TV channel, and digital content. The profits are used to support the National Geographic Society’s research, exploration, and education initiatives. Other examples include Habitat for Humanity’s ReStores, the YMCA, Universities with for-profit ventures, even The Vatican (yes, let’s go there) with investments that are managed by the Vatican’s Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, and the Vatican Bank, these entities generally invest in diverse financial assets, including real estate, stocks, and bonds, to support the Vatican’s operations. 

With all the options at hand, and with all the talent and experience they have at executing one of the most complex events on earth, they could easily come up with ways to keep not only the event but all the rest of their projects funded while not compromising the values. It would require a lot of hard work, and change… yet the best that Marian can come up with is a monthly gift? I’m keeping my $20.",12,1730829431.0,BurningMan,3,0.77,False

Felt a bit upset and annoyed today. Started a new job yesterday. Another person started at the same time. We were completing online training this afternoon and she saw my surname on the screen. She said 'how do you pronounce that?!?' with a derogatory tone. I told her. Now my name is not awful pronounced correctly but if pronounced incorrectly could be mistaken for a rude word for a man's private parts! After I told her the correct pronunciation she said 'oh I bet loads of people pronounce it the wrong way ha ha' and laughed. Now bear in mind I'd never met this woman before yesterday morning and she has already given off an air of superiority to the others in the team 'oh I could never drink instant' for example so not warming to her. I just laughed it off (name thing) but felt really down after. Don't want to put up with aholes like this in the workplace! Would u just ignore and try to stay away or say anything to line manager?

MumOfOneAllAlone · Today 17:01

Definitely don't bring it up to your manager! Just ignore and see how other people respond to her - she sounds like a bellend but maybe she's just nervous

If it's the former, others will see it too x

Gizlotsmum · Today 17:02

I think maybe you are reading too much into it? I will often ask how to pronounce a name ( or apologise if I am about to attempt to pronounce it and get it horribly wrong). I still find it hard to judge intent if not in person. Maybe she is just trying to get to know people?

I think you're being a bit over-sensitive. All the guidance I've ever seen is that if you don't know how to pronounce someone's name, you should ask them. Until you've heard someone quite a bit, it's not always easy to tell what is just their normal tone and what is trying to convey something. And the comment afterwards was just small talk - maybe not the best, but she might just have been trying to be friendly.

It sounds like she might not be ""your type"", but give her a chance - you can probably rub along together even if you are never going to be friends - but you won't if you go running to your line manager after one clumsy attempt at small talk.

Nobody said you've done anything wrong and the responses are positively mild for AIBU.

OP, the workplace is generally rife with wankers. Her quip was possibly nothing but a bad, ill-thought-out joke. You're hyper-focusing on it, and it's a waste of time.

Sounds like she’s going to be a pain in the arse, but your manager should figure that out for themselves! If you were established and she was new, then I might say something, but I don’t think you’re in the right position to do so now.

I certainly wouldn't mention her behaviour to my new manager if I was you! I would just ignore, be nice, give her the benefit of the doubt about being nervous. If it turns out she is horrible then others will pick it up, but I wouldn't complain in a new job (especially for something which isn't a massive issue, just not very nice).

","I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for three years now, and we’re really happy together. However, there’s this one issue that keeps popping up, and it’s driving me crazy. My husband has this “friend,” *Laura,* who’s been in his life since before we met. He mentioned early on in our relationship that she once tried to hook up with him at a party before we got together, but he turned her down. I didn’t think much of it at the time and just brushed it off as past history.

The problem is, Laura still acts… *off.* She constantly texts him, especially late at night, with messages that feel a little too flirty for comfort. Things like, “Thinking about you, hope you’re doing well” or sending him “miss you!” texts when they haven’t seen each other for a week. She even invites him out for one-on-one coffee dates or drinks, and I can’t shake the feeling that she still has feelings for him.

I’ve tried to be understanding and not let it bother me. But every time her name pops up on his phone, I get this sinking feeling. I talked to him about it and told him it makes me uncomfortable, but he says I’m just being insecure and that Laura is “just a friend.” He insists that there’s nothing going on, and that I’m overreacting.

I asked him if he’d consider cutting ties with her or at least setting some boundaries, but he got defensive and said it was controlling of me to even ask. I feel like my concerns are valid—if she tried to hook up with him before, and she’s still sending these kinds of messages, it’s not just “friendly” behavior, right?

Now he’s upset with me, saying he doesn’t want to “lose friends” over my insecurities, and I’m left wondering if I’m really being too controlling here. I don’t want to be that wife who tells her husband who he can and can’t be friends with, but at the same time, I feel like there are boundaries that should be respected.

This is our living room, and it's just not quite right. The couches and chairs and still in great shape so we don't want to replace those, but I was thinking that switching out the rug to something with a bit more warmth and texture might give the room some life.

I like the style of the two Loloi rugs I've included pictures of, but it doesn't have to be that style or brand. (We are also switching out the rectangular coffee table for something round, similar to the picture)

This week, we will do a **Pour-over Workshop** at **LAMILL Coffee in Anaheim**. I'm a big fan of light-roasted specialty coffee and have always been curious about pour-over brewing techniques.

When I stopped by LAMILL Anaheim for the first time, I got to talk to LAMILL's store manager and head barista trainer. After having a fun good conversation, we decided to host a coffee pour-over workshop on Friday 11/15 at 5 PM after their operation hour. It's going to be a private workshop for a small group of 8 people.

LAMILL is a long-time local specialty coffee roaster that was started in 1998. The company's name combines ""LA"" for Los Angeles with ""MILL,"" referencing traditional coffee milling processes. The company became particularly well-known for providing coffee services to the Four Seasons Hotel in Baltimore and Michelin-rated fine dining restaurants.

LAMILL's Head Barista Trainer and Anaheim Store Manager will guide us through. They are passionate coffee professionals who love sharing their knowledge and contributing to the local coffee community. They will introduce pour-over essentials and show us how to repeat the quality coffee experience at home! This is a rare opportunity to learn daily coffee techniques from fine dining coffee professionals. It's going to be a very fun and engaging workshop for coffee lovers. I'm so excited to make this happen ☕️

I just made myself a cup of instant coffee with one teaspoon, took only two sips (about a third of the cup) and went to file my fingernails, while standing. By the time I reached the third fingernail, I started feeling surges of heat and pain in my head. It started to feel like the top of my scalp was burning, while dull pain began to develop in my right hemisphere, as if it were turning into a metal orb, which is how my migraines present. It also feels like my brain is expanding in my skull, which I don't always get.

I had to sit down immediately, and then lie down. Now I am afraid to turn my head in bed, whereas this it morning, I walked for two hours without any serious discomfort. Ever since my viral infection in late August, I have had a constant baseline headache, but now I'm having a full-blown episode. Is it possible for just two sips of coffee to have caused such horrible symptoms so fast? 

I am confused because for the past few weeks, I have been drinking a whole cup of coffee with one teaspoon over a two-hour period without any symptoms. On the other hand, on Sunday before last, I drank a different kind of coffee at a different time of day, namely in the morning instead of in the evening, and that afternoon, I had my worst migraine yet, which also suggests that coffee is a trigger for me, except that that time, my symptoms were delayed by a few hours.

In that regard, it's sort of like Urban Fantasy and one of the most defining tropes of urban fantasy is the method by which all supernatural stuff is obscured to normal people in order to keep the ""normal world"" recognizable to audiences. This is the statute of secrecy from Harry Potter, the masquerade in VTM, or the veil from SCP. What's interesting is that the MCU doesn't seem to have this either. At least not with Kamar Taj. 

In Doctor Strange, Kamar Taj is just a place you can go in Nepal. They have electricity, WiFi, and seemingly no barriers to not telling the outside world they exist. One of the former students of Kamar Taj tells Strange about it with no real hesitation or concern. How on earth has this place not become world famous or at all mentioned before now if nobody was even attempting to keep it secret. This isn't like Wakanda, Ta Lo, Kun Lun, or the Eternals.

I'm very close with my family (I'm an only child, their only real hope, lmao, the pressure is real) and they're really stressed about me getting married. Coming out to them isn't an option as it would break their hearts. I have a long-distance girlfriend (white, Jewish, very supportive and open-minded, aware of my search for an MoC/Lavender Marraige)

I'm looking for someone who's either in the same situation as me (has a long term partner, is gay and unable to come out, etc) and is interested in forming a mutually beneficial, supportive, and trustworthy bond with me! I'm ideally interested in someone who's willing to live with me, be an outward couple to family, but is otherwise my platonic best friend! I'm possibly interested in children in the future and would be interested in co-parenting along with my girlfriend. I want someone who's kind and open minded, communicative, thoughtful, and fun to be around. Marriage doesn't have to be about sex and romance, we can be two roommates who love to hang out. In exchange for your support of me, I can promise that I will be open-minded, thoughtful, and mindful of your personal life, as well! I think of it as platonic polyamory.

**Some Non-Negotiables:** Please be a *citizen* in the states; I've already met someone for an MoC and it was great until my parents really put their foot down and expressed they don't want someone who's trying yo treat me of a greencard or a Visa, lmao.

3. Reward yourself – I started making my mornings more enjoyable, like having a nice coffee or listening to a favorite playlist. Giving myself a little reward for getting up helps make it less of a struggle.

My partner and I have been together off and on for the last fifteen years. We are both in our mid thirties and have been divorced from other people. I've helped her raise her two children from her marriage. We both have a lot of mental health issues - personality disorders, addiction, codependency, suicide attempts, you name it. 

We lived together for a few years before and during covid and at some point I felt (rightly so) like I was being taken advantage of. I am not good at relationships or confrontation or anything so I began ""acting out."" Going to the bar, staying out all night, cheating. Looking back I think this was in the hopes that SHE would end the relationship and I wouldn't have to. 

Fast forward to now, a few years later. We live separately, she has never once wanted to end our relationship. I have tried. We have taken breaks, but it's that codependent and trauma bond type thing where we are just drawn to each other. I am trying through therapy (couples and individual) to figure out where to begin to start untangling this mess of a relationship that is wrought full of insecurities, dishonesty, anxiety, etc. And she absolutely refuses to admit that we shouldn't be together. So in my head I am thinking ""this person loves me despite everything, I should try to make it work.""

I struggle now because I wonder, besides locking myself in my house and only leaving for work, how will I ever be able to have a viable social life outside of this relationship? Something simple like coffee with a coworker - whether male or female is something people who are single or in stable relationships would not think twice about. However this would cause an uncomfortable conversation and would be something I have to over explain and try to be mindful of insecurities and whatnot. (and I admit her insecurities and reactions are 100% valid)

 I take accountability for my terrible actions and choices in this relationship. I have suggested so many times that we should just try to stay in each other's lives but not in a relationship capacity because it just feels like an insurmountable hole I will be digging myself out of forever. I'm not looking for a ""leave"" or ""don't leave"" from anyone.. I guess just some insight would be helpful. I feel like I'm drowning.

The lines looked clean but the tank of water was dirty and grimey.

After scrubbing it many times and using boiling water I cleaned it up and used a cleaning tablet and performed the cleaning cycle.

The milk auto frother was in need of a good cleaning too.

Compared to my philips 3200 this has much more customizable milk foam options with the adjustable knob or a manual wand to steam with.
It was rather difficult to get a good milk foam with the wand. It just heats up too fast without much micro bubbles and if I raise the tip of the wand too much it makes too many large bubbles.

It still tastes less clear than my philips and it might be the settings. I set the grinder to go finer and increase powder quantity for a single shot. The milk texture is definitely better and closer to what my gaggia new baby semi manual machine produced.


I also need to figure out the milk ratio. It definitely gives me a hotter drink which is nice as I prefer it to not be luke warm.

She has one son (my husband) and she has spent the majority of her life controlling him and telling him what to do, even in early adulthood. The level of control is ridiculous, she even told me I could paint my walls any other colour than white as that’s what they’ve always done( I told her that was her taste and we are different).

She once let herself upstairs in my house and sorted through my clothes, she actually through out some clothes without asking! This was all done whilst I was out but husband was here. I came home, absolutely fuming and told her she’d overstepped the mark and she needs to learn what boundaries are. The same evening, I realised my son’s picture of his footprints as a baby had been put in the bin, tea and coffee poured all over them, so completely irreplaceable! I know she did it out of spite but I’ve no proof. It wasn’t me and wasn’t my husband as she was the only other person to have been here. Hubby wouldn’t ask her about it and said that she had probably done it by accident and he didn’t want to upset her by asking!! I told him that I was his wife and I was upset so surely he should call her out on it…he never did! I mentioned it and she denied all knowledge. 

Recently my nephew has been asking for a drum kit! My husband told him not to buy one as he has one in his old garage from when he was a kid. We text the MIL to say we were popping around to get it and she refused to let my nephew have it! She said ‘oh we spent a lot of money buying that for you’ and ‘I thought your son would want it so I’m keeping it for him’ I am aware again, that this is out of spite! I’ve now purchased one for my nephew, and if my son ever wants one, he can have that one. I’ve told her she may as well throw hers away or sell it, as I’ve bought one now anyway. She is absolutely fuming with me, won’t talk to me (which I’m quite glad about 🤣) and said that it was her dream to give it to my son and that I’ve ruined that! I’ve explained she ruined it herself by not allowing my nephew to have it for a while but she can’t understand. 

I actually hate her, I could be sat here all day writing all the controlling and domineering things she’s done to our family in the past. Has anyone ever been able to get past this issue with their mother in laws. She seems to think it’s her way or the highway, she can’t grasp that her son is now a grown up, married man with his own two children. It’s like she still wants to control every aspect of his life. Hubby can’t see it and always says ‘she’s trying to help’. How can I make him see that this behaviour ain’t right.

We had our fun but nothing formal happened. It wasn't until after we graduated and we reconnected through some mutual friends that we started to seriously fall for each other. Sara had gotten a job at the city's hospital and I was working for real estate firm. Our families seemed to really like us together and we took the next step in buying a condo together and before we knew it, I popped the question. Being from a well-off family, I was able to afford a decent sized ring that Sara really liked. It was a fairy tale.

The whole time we were dating and after our engagement, Sara told me that she was upset that her childhood best friend hadn't seen her in so long. It had been so long that I haven't even met you. Sure, tons of FaceTime.. but that didn't count. Sara was so excited that you agreed to be her bridesmaid but knew that you'd have to eventually travel here to Raleigh in order to get your dress fitted.

The wedding... I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy the process of planning the wedding. It's just that.. To me, a wedding was just a party amongst friends. By the time we were a few months out from the big day, she had already blown the budget. I had agreed to pay for part of the wedding along with her dad. Regardless, the pieces were starting to fall into place. One missing piece, your dress was being taken care of this weekend when you were visiting.

It's the morning that you're getting here, a Friday, I was planning on taking a half day at work. I'm drinking coffee and looking at some mail. Long story short, there's a bill for a wedding expense that I didn't know about. I find out that Sara had gotten a ""separate"" wedding budget from her father. We both leave for work pretty upset. She's upset that I'm not giving her a dream wedding and I'm upset at the thought of her deceit.

A few hours into my workday, I get a text from Sara. ""Sorry about this morning, I want to talk about this tonight. I'm stuck here for longer. Are you able to sneak out of work and pick her up from the airport? :) <3 xoxo""

I see the text and I don't really have an option. The ""her"" is you and I'm on my way to pick you up now...

Hey all! So I had started this idea for someone else that doesn't want to play anymore but the idea is the your character is my fiance's childhood best friend and we haven't met yet. There is plenty of room for you to provide background. Our characters haven't met in person, only via some FaceTimes with Sara where I was in the background. I wrote this in first person but happy to do third person too! Girls, lots of sneaking around in this one. Let's play!

I am detailed, interested in a natural and realistic development. I am very patient and I love to write! I also love references for our characters.

I have years and years of playing experience. I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play. Looking for a good mix of play and smut but I don't want the role to be smut heavy, I do enjoy amazing storytelling.

Interests: bareback, oral, anal, unprotected , creampies, lingerie, heels, shorts, short skirts/dresses, long slender legs, rough, light hair pulling and spanking, oral (giving and receiving), mutual attraction/teasing/seduction.

Limits: scat, gore.

I really hope to hear back from you to discuss the role more! I desperately want a long term play. You can respond to my start or we can discuss the roleplay first. You pick. I have lots of other ideas too, like my style but wanna try something else - just hit me up.",1,1730826576.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Now it's time to look at an espresso machine, I'm not going to go for 1000 for espresso machine ; I'm just not happy with that price. I've looked around a bit, and I've seen the bambino Plus and the Profitec Go Matt Black recommended (it's a bit expensive....).

My buying ideals are: I like things to last, support and reliability, I don't like excessive random quality. I really appreciate that it doesn't take me too long to get ready, when I go to work in the morning I wake up at 4:50 and I'm out the door at 5:15.

I don't know if it will be of any use. When I was a child I managed coffee machines in bars and I have worked as a bartender occasionally, but I have not received any training nor have I approached specialty coffee until now.

I’m looking for spring break options that are family friendly for my husband and I and our two kids (5 and 8 yo).  We would like a swim out room so the kids can swim while we sit out with them and drink our morning coffee.  Instead of having to pack a bunch of stuff and trek out to a pool constantly.  Xcaret is on my radar but I’m reserving that for a few years from now when they can do the excursions.  My husband and I went to Arte a couple years ago and loved it.  Also would like to keep costs below 1k per night.,0,1730826492.0,cancun,2,0.5,False
1gkbmw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/1gkbmw5/rate_this_power/,Rate this power,"For those who are aware of Fate/Stay night, I’m basing this off of Assassin’s Tsubame Gaeshi and Coil’s power. 

On Superpower wiki, this power is called Concurrent Possibilities. 

The ability to perform multiple actions at the same time, all from the same starting point. You can step forward, jump to the side, and duck, all at once. 

Once you activate this power, you can perform several different actions (suggest to me a max number of possibilities for a balanced power). When you stop using the power, all possibilities converge and you choose one living possibility to continue on from, not unlike Coil’s ability to choose his actions. 

Unlike Coil, all of these actions are real, and so affect the world around them. For example, if you break a window in one possibility, but choose another possibility to continue from, that window will still be broken, for you still broke it.

Killing you in one possibility removes the option to continue from that point, and you have to choose another.

The different possibilities do not share any sort of connection, and do not know what is happening to their other possible selves. 

Example of short term power use: 
-in a fist fight, you activate your power and throw a right hook and a roundhouse kick at the same time. Your opponent blocks the punch and gets hit by the kick. 

Your opponent recovers and tries to stab you. You activate your power and dodge both left and right. The left one gets stabbed, so you choose the right dodge to be the final possibility. The you that dodged left vanishes, as does the blood on the knife, for even though it stabbed you, you were not there. 

Example of longer term power use:
-in an attempt to get away from a group of gang members, you run down an alley. You come to a split where you could go left or right, and activate your power. 

A version of you runs in each direction, making the ones chasing you split up to follow you. The one that went left found the street and came across a patrolling hero who helped them. 

The one that went right hit a dead end and was beaten to death. The one that went left does not know that, but deactivates their power now that they are safe. The one that went right vanishes. 

Example of an interaction:
-you activate your power and drive to work while staying at home. The one at work does all the paperwork that needs doing, drinks all the coffee, and accidentally crashes your car on the way home. 

You deactivate your power, remaining at home all day. Your car has not been crashed, though what your other self crashed into is still damaged. The paperwork has been done, but there is no record of you ever stepping into work to do it, and the coffee pot is empty, despite no one drinking it. ",7,1730826446.0,WormFanfic,2,1.0,False

Thank you guys for everyone who commented on the post.

So, without further ado, here's an update: The next day after posting I sent my SIL a text asking her if we, (my husband, her, and I) could meet to talk things in person, and she agreed. So, after dropping the kids off, we met for coffee.

I don't want to get into much detail in case someone near me reads about this, but, it turns out that someone told my SIL that they had offered to pay for a nanny and that we turned down the offer (which is a blatant lie), so she felt hurt and lashed out on me, thinking I didn't want to attend her ceremony, and that we were refusing help out of pride.

We cleared the air, and in an amazing turn of events, instead of simply confronting the person about their lie, my husband called said person in front of my SIL and said we would be more than glad to take them up on their offer to hire a nanny. It was a fun call (my husband is brilliant and I love him for his resourcefulness). 

We've taken steps to ensure we don't take advantage of anyone, or endanger our kids because of possible retaliation or pettiness so, the nanny will **only** take care of them before my mom is able to arrive and take over, which will be around 2 hours max, and once they're asleep, my mom will watch them and sleepover at our house. We're very grateful to my mom, so we'll treat her to some chilaquiles and frijoles de olla the next morning :) 

I don't think there will be another update to this (hopefully), but it was nice to find out that her reaction wasn't uncalled for, just a misunderstanding caused by a lie.",70,1730826220.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,13,1.0,False
1gkbi0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1gkbi0m/proposal_helphow_to_set_up_my_surprise_when/,Proposal help—how to set up my surprise when living and working from home together??,"Hi Everyone,

I'm so very excited to propose to my girlfriend, who actually has already proposed to me since we've decided to queer up the entire genre of proposals and allow ourselves both the excitement of being the one to ask / getting asked!!

Her proposal was absolutely beautiful and caught me by surprise (and was recorded), and she also was able to set up and decorate our house since she had me out of the way with a friend. I'm trying to also provide that element of surprise for her, and would love to do that labor of setting something up for her.

Here's the thing, though: we both work at least partially from home and spend all of our free time together, which makes hiding things hard, lol. She's had time alone to plan since I go into the office a couple days a week, but it's tough for me because I'm never at home without her, since she is working from home right now.

  
I have an idea to propose to her in the building we have dance class at every week (and where we already booked our wedding venue lol, bc we are classic u-hauls) because it has become such a special place for us and is truly a beautiful place. This would require me getting out of the house without her being suspicious, though. Can you all let me know if you think this could possibly work / what other things I could do to try and pull it off?

**Option 1**

* Ask our dance instructor to send a ""fake"" text to just my partner and I that our dance class will take place earlier the following week for a special Christmas dance (he's already on board, and he routinely tells us about dances last minute so it wouldn't be so suspicious)
* Even though this is a day I normally work from home, tell my partner I have a late event in-person from 3-4:30 but that I'll be home for dinner and for us to get ready for the dance (I do occasionally have evening in-person events like this, so it's not unheard of, and I can even tap into some colleagues to create a fake calendar invitation in case she were to see me open my calendar)
* Leave around 2:45 to head to ""the work event,"" but really go to the building and set up and decorate a room that I rent. I can put out tea candles, maybe some fairy lights and petals, and set up a tripod with a camera so that I can record her reaction (or, alternately, I can ask some friends to be there and then come in to capture it for me, which is what my partner did). I also can have a speaker there ready for us to dance ourselves to some of our special songs on our playlist. I was thinking I could ask some friends if they would be free to help me decorate, in case it takes longer than I was anticipating (and since I need to get home in time with the event)
* Go home by 4:45 like I would if I were at an event, have a quick dinner, get ready and changed for dance
* Act like we're going to the dance but as we enter the building, steer her toward the room I've set up
* Walk her in, let her take it all in, alert her there is no dance and then make my speech/get down on one knee. Either have the tripod/video rolling from when I left earlier, or at this point ask friends to sneak in and get some shots
* Afterward, do a couple dances with the speaker I've set up
* Then, clean up the room and actually get ready for our dance class that is happening that same evening (or we can skip it if she doesn't feel up for it)
* After dance class, take her to the coffee shop we had our first date (right around the corner), and order her a hot chocolate and give us a chance to bask in the proposal and recap all of the planning (what we did after she proposed, lol we love re-groupong like this)

My goal is to catch her off guard since our dance teacher is telling us to come sooner, when really it's just giving her an excuse to get all dressed up and I will use my work event as an excuse to go and decorate the room I rented. This might cost for a few hundred dollars in terms of renting the room and buying some equipment, but honestly, she's more than worth it and I'm more interested in just creating a magical experience for her.

**Option 2**

Another option that my dance teacher suggested is that he can schedule an actual dance, and at the end of it, he can shoo the others away, play our favorite song, and record as I get down on one knee and ask her. This feels lower-key but definitely more doable with less things to hide. We're not doing rings at this point since we are going to order after I propose, so all I have to do it have something to say and try and get someone to record the event. It would also be free, but I could still take her out for hot chocolate afterwards. 

**Option 3**

Yet *another* option is to actually combine 1 and 3 and have my instructor actually schedule the dance as planned, and instead, I just lead her to the special room I set up and we can still go to the dance for part of the time after the proposal (and maybe commission some friends to help clean up, if they could, or we could get it as we are heading out). We also can just skip it if we like and as we feel.

What are everyone's thoughts?? I really want to make this special for her, but I'm just so paranoid about her finding out lol. I really want to make option 1 or even option 3 happen because I love the idea of setting up a special space for her, and I just can't do it at home since we are constantly together and after her proposal of sending me away for the day, I'm afraid of tipping her off.  I'm also lowkey nervous about solely relying on my dance teacher, which is why I think option 3 might work out really well. 

It's been driving me crazy trying to actually solidify my plans, so any insight would be appreciated!!",2,1730826115.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

My first ever dog is going soon. I’m so scared because I’ve never had a dog die on me before.

She was my first puppy. She was only 8 months old when we got her; fidgety, nosy, and funny. She was a Cocker spaniel, so beautiful; covered in these coffee brown patches, mixed with splotches of white and darker chocolate brown shades. She has freckles all over the white splotches of her fur; I remember rubbing my hands over her soft hair as I pet her.

As a puppy, she would sleep on my chest in my bed every night; she’d put her big chubby paws on the side of my bed, watching me patiently, waiting for me to pick her up. 

When I cried after fights with my parents, or when I felt lonely or depressed, she laid with me, letting me cry into her fur.

She loved to eat, always happy to get snacks and her food during the day. When she saw birds or squirrels, she’d jump up and slap her paws together in attempts to catch it. It was cute and funny since she never caught anything anyway; it was like her way of showing excitement.

As time passed, she got older; she lost her eye sight and she can’t hear pretty much anything anymore. Now, she has a tumor on her stomach, and she’s crying from the pain…

I’m not home to see her be put to sleep. I’m too scared to go see her because I don’t know it would do to me to see that. I love her so much, even though she often was overwhelming in her last years from all the care she needed. But that wasn’t her fault; she was just a very sick dog in her senior years.

I’ve known for the last 5 years that her time was probably coming soon, and I especially knew it this year; she started suffering dementia and nothing was helping. Now, it’s time. But I’m terrified.

I don’t understand death at all. My aunt died of COVID during the quarantine and I still hurt over that even though sometimes I still wish she was alive and that it never happened..being autistic makes it really hard for me to process these things. Being bipolar makes the pain even more excruciating.

I can’t stop crying. My heart hurts so much; all I want is for her to be immortal. I don’t want her to die, I just want her to be a puppy again so she can sleep on my chest one more time.

any comfort is so appreciated, dad…

Life has felt painfully lonely lately and it's been taking a toll on my mental health. I have got all these thoughts, ideas, and stories inside but no one to really share them with. I miss the simple pleasure of chatting over a cup of coffee, talking about things like tech, politics, sports, movies, or the stock market. Just talking to someone, you know? And, honestly, I am willing to pay a handsome amount for someone’s time if it meant a genuine connection (25-30k per month).



I am not looking to pour my heart out or vent. I want companionship even if a temporary. Someone who might enjoy discussing ideas, sharing experiences, or learning from each other. I am 37 M and separated.  While I have been fortunate enough to find professional success (I sold one venture and currently run another), I feel a deep void on the personal front. Success feels hollow without people to share it with.



If you are someone looking for a chance to learn and grow professionally/ academically or just have a good chat without judgment feel free to DM me. I have been around long enough to offer some career guidance, maybe share a few life skills, and I genuinely enjoy seeing people grow. More than anything, I would love to find someone to help me keep my own balance and avoid slipping deeper into this loneliness.



Before anyone jumps to conclusions or downvotes, please understand mental health struggles are very real. I have been betrayed and cheated on 3 times and it’s hard to trust in relationships again. But at the end of the day, I am just human. I crave for just a casual chats or a few laughs over coffee. 



what I am looking for: a buddy to share coffee, hugs, maybe travel a bit and have conversations that go beyond the surface.



what I am not looking for: Not looking for any sexual or romantic relations



If this resonates with anyone out there or maybe you are feeling the same way or just open to new connections, I would be happy to connect.

# Welcome to your new Mod Free Origins SMP

We are are a Minecraft SMP Origins Server for 1.20-1.21 with custom tailored plugins that promotes a crossplay experience for both java and bedrock players without the need to install any mods. With heavy inspiration from the original Origins mod, we are inspired from the original mod  with additional new twist for the origins such as a Blazeborn's new heat gauge mechanic or Shulk capability to levitate enemies on hit.

We promote a friendly nontoxic environment and focus development to promote player to player interactions to create memorable experiences. We do not allow griefing, stealing, or harassment. We do offer a supporter rank for those wanting to show appreciation but only provide small QOL changes to avoid P2W advantages and to keep the server fair to all.

# Why Play Origins Reborn?

*Processing img w804v9xwyarc1...*

We offer a unique Towny experience via custom plugin integration to encourage both roleplay and teamwork within a low inflation player driven economy. Towns are encouraged to be a center point of activity for both town members and guests with new mechanics such as the Tavern and Market systems.

*Processing img 2743wr0yyarc1...*

Enhance the vanilla experience with the famous Brewery Plugin with over 20 new drinks ranging from brews, coffees, teas, liquid orbs of origin, and more.  New coinvent recipes have been added to allow megabuild  projects to be more obtainable. We plan to continue to add more Quality of life changes over time.

*Processing img ai0w71gyyarc1...*

While PVP is not the primary focus of the server, players may join an optional PVP bounty system. The bounty system allows players to receive bounties and hunt others for monetary reward, but at the risk of losing some yourself.  Opted out players have defenses to discourage unwanted PVP.

*Processing img 80lgf26dxdcd1...*

We strive to have compatibility for as many players as possible. This means anyone can join even without mods, and allow players from Mobile, Console, Bedrock PC, and Java to play. We do not support cracked clients though, so you would need access to a Minecraft account

I have an appointment in a few days with the an Allergist but in the meantime I’m trying to figure out what caused it. Any help/info is appreciated. 

Here’s the list of what I ate within a couple hours of the reaction. 

- Peanut butter - eat frequently 
- salted pistachios - eat these everyday and never had an issue. 
- rotisserie chicken from supermarket 
- Tortilla 
- franks hot sweet and sour sauce
- Some kind of McCormick dry seasoning - never had before. 
 - coffee with milk - I drink milk in coffee or other forms frequently 
- Diet Coke

That’s everything that I can recall. My first thought was it’s gotta be the nuts but I find it hard to believe I developed such a bad allergy overnight as I eat pistachios pretty much every day and peanut butter / penuts frequently. The last time I had peanut butter was like 2 or three days ago. 

Also I should probably mention that there are a couple immediate family members of mine that developed an allergy to shell fish in there 20s after the they had no issues eating them prior to that. I would have thought that would be my problem but nothing I ate has shell fish in it (that I know of) and I do t really see how any of it could have been contaminated. I guess the chicken could have been somehow but seems unlikely to me. 

I’m worried about eating anything now as I have no idea what caused the reaction.  Does anyone have experience with developing food allergies later in life? Any advice is appreciated, thank you 🙏. ",3,1730825391.0,FoodAllergies,3,1.0,False

Hey Reddit,

I never thought I’d find myself posting here, but life has thrown me a massive curveball, and I need to share my story. I’m (30M), and I’ve been married to my wife, Emily (28F), for two years. We met in college, fell in love, and tied the knot soon after graduation. While I know that marriage can have its challenges, I truly believed we had a solid relationship. That is, until everything came crashing down.

Chapter 1: The Discovery

Last week, I came home from work a little early. I was excited to surprise Emily with dinner. As I walked in the door, I noticed the house was unusually quiet. I called out to her, but there was no response. A sinking feeling started to grow in my stomach as I made my way to our bedroom.

When I opened the door, the sight before me shattered my world. There was Emily, tangled in the sheets with my younger brother, Ryan (24M). They both froze, eyes wide with shock, and I felt my heart drop to my stomach. I stood there, speechless, as the reality of betrayal washed over me.

Chapter 2: Confrontation

After what felt like an eternity, I finally managed to find my voice. I yelled at them to get dressed, and I demanded an explanation. Emily started to cry, saying it was a mistake, that she was lonely when I worked late, and that she never meant for it to happen. Ryan, on the other hand, looked like he was about to pass out.

I kicked them both out of the house. I couldn’t bear to look at either of them. I felt a whirlwind of emotions: anger, betrayal, sadness, and disbelief. How could she do this? And with my brother, of all people? 

Chapter 3: The Fallout

In the days that followed, I was a mess. I barely ate or slept. I reached out to my closest friends for support, and they were there for me through it all. I couldn’t help but feel like I’d lost two people who meant the world to me. 

I confronted Ryan over text, and he apologized profusely. He claimed it was a moment of weakness, that he never meant to hurt me. I didn't respond. I didn’t know how to process the fact that my own brother had betrayed me in the worst way possible.

Chapter 4: The Decision

After a week of solitude and soul-searching, I decided to meet with Emily for a final confrontation. I needed closure. When we met, she was full of remorse, begging for another chance. She claimed it was a one-time mistake and that she loved me. But the trust was shattered. I told her I couldn’t be with someone who had so easily thrown away our marriage. 

As for Ryan, I told him that I needed space and that our relationship would never be the same. I’ve since cut ties with him, and it’s been painful, but I know it’s what I need to do for my own sanity.

Chapter 5: The Road to Healing

Fast forward a few weeks, and I’m still reeling, but I’m slowly starting to heal. I’ve thrown myself into work and picked up some hobbies that I had neglected. I’ve also started therapy, which has been incredibly helpful.

In the midst of all this turmoil, I’ve come to realize something important: I deserve better. I deserve someone who values loyalty and love, and I’m determined to find that person again someday.

UPDATE:

Hey everyone, I just wanted to thank you all for your support and kind words. It’s been a tough journey, but I’m finding strength in myself that I didn’t know I had. I’ve started going out with friends more and even met someone new—just a coffee for now, but it’s nice to feel a spark again. 

As for Emily and Ryan, I haven’t spoken to either of them since that fateful day. I’m moving on, and I feel lighter every day. Life is too short to dwell on betrayal. Here’s to new beginnings!

***Saturday:*** 

Woke up with my partner around 8am. Went to the cafe beside my house and sat and talked with him until 11am. We just blabbered on and on for three hours and people watched. The weather outside was sunny and chilly and the fall leaves and pumpkins were perfect. Almost cartoonishly perfect. 

Then we went back to mine, where I made us brunch. Then we napped until 2pm. Then we got in the car, the weather still beautiful and blustery and bright, and went to pick up sandwiches on our way out of town. We ended up driving to a national park, where we went on a 10km hike through the woods. It was so yellow and golden, and we watched the light change from sunny to sunset to light blue. 

On our dark drive back into the city, a storm hit. We watched the dark clouds roll in across the corn fields. Getting back into town, we decided to stop at a warm, crowded, steamy Thai restaurant for dinner. We had to wait forty minutes for a table and we played word games the whole time and were killing ourselves laughing. Then we had dinner sitting at the window. We drove home and watched a scary movie in my bed on the projector. 

***Sunday:*** 

We woke up again around 8 am, but this time it was super rainy and cloudy. Another, yet different, prototypical fall day. Because my bedroom was still set up with the projector, my partner decided to put on a movie (which we literally never do in the mornings. It was like a special treat haha) and he put on the godfather, which I'd never seen. 

We watched the first 90 minutes and I was AMAZED. I was obsessed. Then he turned it off and was like ""and we can finish it tonight"". But because I was so obsessed we decided to have a ""godfather"" themed day. So we went to the cafe beside my house again, got coffees to go, and walked a 45 minute walk through my beautiful neighborhood to our favourite brunch place. We had eggs benedict. We stayed there for two full hours. 

Then, we walked through the farmer's market to get stuff for dinner. Then we popped into my favourite vintage store and he bought me a cozy scarf just as a random present/surprise. Then we meandered through Little Italy and went into this old-school bakery from 1955 and got pistachio cannolis and ate them outside with our freezing cold hands. 

Then we went home for our couple's therapy session on Zoom with our therapist and really successfully worked out a kink we had in our communication over a disagreement from a couple weeks ago. 

As it was starting to get dark, we realized that we forgot to get gluten-free pasta (I am newly diagnosed celiac) at the market. He flicked on some lights in my living room and lit some candles and said ""you go get the pasta from the store, I'll tidy up around here and do the dishes and chop the garlic"". 

So I went to the grocery store (I love supermarkets at night for some reason) and talked on the phone to my friend to catch up while I browsed the aisles, knowing my best friend ever was waiting for me at home. I think that was my favourite part of the weekend, being at the grocery store and knowing I had a full night ahead with him still. 

When I got home, he was playing jazz in the kitchen and singing along to it. He'd cleaned my apartment and done all my dishes and was preparing things for dinner. We danced a little bit in the kitchen and he poured me a glass of wine. He kissed me on the head. We made tomato sauce together. And I forget what we were laughing so hard at but we were in stitches basically the whole time. We facetimed his mom and my friend. 

We ate our pasta and then went into my room to watch the last 90 minutes of the godfather. He paused it every three minutes so I could ask questions. He always does that because I need to talk through every scene of every movie. He says it is one of his favourite parts of watching movies with me. That makes me feel so adored. 

***Monday*****:** 

We are in a long distance relationship, so he was going to drive back to his city on Monday morning. I decided to go with him to be his date to the premiere of his TV show. However, on our way back to his city, he asked if I wanted to stop somewhere along the drive for another hike. We did. It was supposed to be an hour long detour, but it ended up being a five hour long detour because our hike was so so so beautiful. EVEN BETTER than the hike from Saturday, can you even believe it? 

Then, our car broke down as we were driving in the night back to his city. He said we can make a fun adventure out of it. So we got a hotel in a small town and spent the night. Something stressful turned wonderful. 

**Tuesday morning** we got back to the city after sitting in the pouring rain in rush hour traffic for three hours. A busy freeway with billions of cars rushing through rush hour in the rain. But inside our car we were talking and drinking our coffees and at peace. And happy. Just happy. That's all. And then that evening went out for sushi and to his premiere. 

It was hands down the best weekend of my life, even though it doesn't seem like much. A lot of walking and talking was basically what it was. But doing it alongside him is thrilling and hilarious and just feels like my heart finally has a home. We are not a new couple. But it feels like we are!

1gkb1mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1gkb1mf/genderqueer_in_a_sexuality_crisis_any_advice/,genderqueer in a sexuality crisis— any advice?,"when i was 10 or 11 i remember saying to my friend, “if i could’ve chosen my gender from birth, i’d choose no gender at all”. this was the beginning of my queer journey but jump to the middle of 6th grade. i go to an arts school, have a queer friend group, and in a very embarrassing way i realized i was a lesbian. 

then tragedy struck (puberty)

puberty was the lowest point in my life because all i really wanted was to have control and be me. this and the blossoming dysphoria played into me coming out as nonbinary in 9th grade. when i started telling my friends, one of them said “then i guess you’re not a lesbian anymore.” (she was straight so she didn’t really have a say in this) but since at that time i didn’t know that nonbinary lesbians were a thing, i just assumed that she was right and i couldnt be a lesbian anymore.

i went between labels and names and at around 16 i stayed as a gay transmasc for around 2 or 3 years, started testosterone shortly after turning 18, but it always felt like something was missing.

i knew for a fact i wasnt a woman, but i struggled with my attraction towards men until 19 where i came out to two of my friends as bi. but i still felt like i suppressed everything because i was tired of confronting something new and having to come out over and over again. it came to the point where i wasnt able to relate to gay media the way i did before. the months were going by and overall i was too depressed to do any self reflection.

but a little while after turning 19 i finally got a job at a local coffee shop, which was my inevitable entrance towards an environment with other queer people. as time went by i’d get closer with my coworkers, and i’d slowly start to drop my mask, and it became harder to put off coming to terms with my identity. i cared less and less about my gender, and i realized that gender to me was how i defined it. ive identified as genderqueer ever since, but my attraction to strictly women/non-men was creeping up on me more and more. 

i remember around 2-3 months after starting my job i was on a closing shift with a coworker of mine (who i will call C). we share a lot of the same interests, and i recently went to a drag show with her, and from the start i always felt some sort of connection with her. back to the closing shift— at work we’re able to put on almost any music we want as long as it’s appropriate, so when i went to turn off the music for the night she goes “dont worry they’ll definitely know it was me”. the music in question was a 90s lesbian rock playlist which i am still digging through spotify trying to find. but something hit me that day. 

trying to decipher the feeling further at work i realized how less attracted to men i am then i thought i was. even though they’re visibly attractive, inside i dont feel much. the feeling is all too familiar to my younger lesbian self. so i started looking into more lesbian media, and that old feeling was there again. i remember seeing a thread by a butch artist in where they talked about the feeling of coming full circle with their identity just like i did, and it lingers in my mind. at that drag show i went to with C, the host asked for the lesbians in the crowd to shout. C did, yet i looked down in silence. for the rest of the night i felt this emptiness within myself, and it felt like the peak of all my confusion and doubt i had been dealing with for so long. 

despite all this, part of me still says that i’m attracted to men. maybe it’s the fact that im genderqueer that confuses things. maybe im scared to admit that i was wrong about my past, or that im coming back to where i started. overall, i just dont know what to do, and i’m hoping that this can reach anyone with a similar experience

This weekend I was struggling though and had some sugar and it felt like I took drugs, like brain high, warm fuzzies, ton of energy.

Back to keto during the week, I did an hour if hard yardwork after work and feel great the next day.

I know some people take longer to go in and out of ketosis and feel bad on the transition, but for me it's amazing.

A couple weeks ago I was going right to bed after work, and now I'm kicking ass and taking names. 

I used to make fun of it but now start may day with butter in my coffee, meal around 10:30 then another around 7pm. I'm doing chicken with lots of added fats because I want to avoid the heme iron in red meat. 

I've been adding a tiny bit of fermented soybean paste to my meals for the probiotics, it's like half a spoonful and shouldn't break me ketosis but I haven't bought test strips to check.

The people we love/d who have been sucked into the cult are going to cause us stress regardless of the outcome. Not to mention our own stress about who will win. Here are mindful grounding techniques I use when I'm panicking. Hope it helps. 

**Square Breathing:**
-Slowly exhale all of your air out. 
 -Gently inhale through your nose to a slow count of 4. 
 -Hold at the top of the breath for a count of 4. 
 -Gently exhale through your mouth for a count of 4. 
 -Pause and hold at the bottom of the breath for a count of 4. 
 *Repeat steps 1 to 3 until you feel re-centered. 


 **5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique**
**Name 5 things you can see**
Take a moment to spot five things in your immediate environment. Whether it's a basic office chair or a cherished family photo, the goal is to really see the details—like color, form, and texture. By diverting your focus to your sense of sight, you disrupt the cycle of anxious or stressful thoughts.

**Name 4 things you can hear**
Close your eyes and listen to the ambient noises around you. They could be anything from a fan humming to birds singing, or people talking in the distance. Identifying these sounds helps steer your mind away from inward worries and more toward the world around you, anchoring you in the present moment.

**Name 3 things you can feel**
Concentrate on the sense of touch to further ground yourself. Become aware of three things you can feel. They could be the fabric of your clothes against your skin, the texture of an item you're holding, or the solidity of the floor under your feet. 

**Name 2 things you can smell**
Take a deep breath and identify two distinct smells around you. They could be the welcoming aroma of fresh coffee or the clean scent of hand soap. Tuning into these smells helps shift your focus from looping thoughts to your immediate surroundings, reinforcing your connection to the present moment.

**Name 1 thing you can taste**
Finally, focus on your sense of taste. You might want to take a sip of water,, or simply focus on the lingering flavor of toothpaste in your mouth. Centering on this final sense completes the cycle and firmly brings you back to the present moment.

(If you don't know what that is, it's a civilian organization that helps military families. Their website can provide more information.) In my situation, they have a space designated for active duty military and/or dependents in the DFW airport. I was so thankful to have a lounging space. I felt a lot safer and cozier than if I were to find a random area in the airport. *Spouses, you don't need your AD spouse to get in.* You can show up as long as you have your ID. All amenities were free, from what I saw.

They offer a few amenities:

- Basic Snacks: Bagels, Hot dogs, french toast (breakfast) and other things like apple sauce, juice, soda, coffee. Really basic, but it's nice to not have to pay for those things. 

- Lounges: People were sleeping on these couches. They also have beds or cots, apparently. I didn't use it because I only had to wait a few hours.

- Tech: Computers, TVs, charging stations.

- Library: has kids/adult books, magazines, etc

- Basic hygiene items: Toothpaste/brush, wipes.... that's all I can remember RN.

- Play area for kids: It's small, but it's definitely better than having to pray that your takes kid doesn't just run off. It felt very safe, compared to the rest of DFW. 

- Volunteers: They have people who can direct you to your location, help you find cuisine/hotels etc. Super helpful and kind.

 - Critiques: Cannot leave bags there (TSA's fault, not USO). Was kinda stinky. A little intimidating if you're not used to being surrounded by military men. (I say men because it was literally 95% active duty men there, not including volunteers. Volunteers were about 1/2 and 1/2.) Not enough lounging spaces, so you might have to wait a bit. A little cramped right when it opens at 8, but it cleared up quickly.

i matched with this girl 19f who we’ll call sofia. sofia initially texted me first and we established what it is we wanted from each other. i told her that im open to almost anything except for hookups. she told me pretty much the same thing so we started talking more. everything was going so well. we were flirting and bouncing off each other’s energy, it was great. i eventually got her number and got on ft for the first time. not quite a face to face interaction but it was the closest thing we had for now. we played some games and i thought everything was going well. it got late so we hung up and went to bed. the next day she became distant and ended up blocking me with no explanation.

i get out of my feelings and move on and i match with someone else who we’ll call carla. again, carla 18f was the one to text me first. she asks me what im doing on the dating app and i tell her straight up that im kinda looking for a girlfriend either short or long term. she told me she was just trying to meet people on her college campus/nearby but she was open to the idea of dating. conversations are going exponentially well and im really starting to like her. we eventually meet up and before i ended up getting there she told me she’d have to leave at around 7pm bc she had things to take care of. she didn’t end up leaving until 9pm so i took it as a “well maybe she likes me too” not even 2 days later she stops replying to my messages and the energy in the conversations just aren’t there anymore. so i give up

about a week ago i met with a third person who we’ll call mia. mia 20f and i instantly connected bc of our shared love of spider-man. we made flirtatious jokes about being peter and mj and miles and gwen. it was around halloween time so i showed her my miles morales suit that i bought. i wasn’t wearing it until she told me that she wanted to see it on me so i put it on and she called me “hot” and that she desperately needed to find a gwen suit. i know that for the most part she was joking but it was okay. yesterday we finally got the chance to meet up and thought it went well. we got coffee and just talked for a few hours. when i left she told me to text her when i got home and once i did that she liked the message and i haven’t heard from her since. that was 16 hours ago.

i am severe adhd and am probably on the spectrum and i made it very clear before talking to all three of them and they told me they understood. i’m not sure if after a while i just became off putting or what but it sucks not being able to connect with people. i don’t hold any hatred towards anyone just a little bummed. especially with carla bc i really really liked her.",1,1730824610.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

As I was getting off the flight, a woman (25ish F?) behind me asked for help getting her luggage from the overhead. I don’t know the full details but she has some type of muscle weakness in her hands/ arms. I helped her out, helped her take her stuff off the plane and made my way solo through the airport in search of coffee. We semi-awkwardly both ended up at the same coffee place, smiled and waved, and then also semi-awkwardly made it to the same shuttle for an adjacent terminal. We broke the awkwardness with some chit-chat, found out we were on the same flight to Boston with an annoying 3+ hr layover, and I offered to help with her luggage again. 

We ended up hanging out at the gate and had an honestly great time talking. We had a lot of time to burn, so I feel like we got to know each other pretty well. She talked about our pets (snake, cat and dog for her, and cat for me), her job in graphic design, our Halloween plans. She’s in town this week to see a friend in grad school and scope the city out to move here in the near future from Tampa. We eventually boarded the plane to Boston and walked together through Logan where she sat down to wait for her phone to update the Uber app. 

This is where things went a little off the rails. We were both initially heading to the same ride share area, so when she audibled I got a little in my head, thinking that her Uber update was just an excuse to kind of end our time together.  She asked for my Snapchat, I told her I didn’t have one, and then we kind of awkwardly said goodbye. 

Not looking for anything romantic here; just an honest friendship with someone I connected with. If she or her friend see this, I hope they DM and we find a chance to meet up sometime if you move to the city! She told me her first name, so I’ll know you’re legit if you message me.

1gkavop,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkavop,My Marble Tables Have Finally Arrived! Looking for Some Accent Chair Ideas,"Hey everyone! After a long wait, my custom marble tables are finally here! I designed both the dining table and coffee table myself. For the dining room, I was inspired by the Mario Mangiarotti M1 Skipper table and went with a sleek Black Marquina marble, paired with Cesca chairs I purchased directly from the original owner's son. They're made in Italy, 1970—so cool to have pieces with that kind of history.  

For the living room, I chose a Calacatta Viola marble coffee table with subtle grey veining instead of violet, which blends in nicely with the space. My favorite piece in the living room, though, is a brass-on-Nero Portoro lamp by Walter Von Nessen. It’s an original found at a small shop in Cleveland and still stamped with the Nessen Studio, Bronx, NY 1948. Which I think is pretty neat!

Two extra Cesca chairs are holding down the living room while I search for the perfect accent chairs to contrast the Mario Bellini inspired  boucle couch (I went with the one from Rove Concepts). I’m tempted by leather Wassily chairs but would love other ideas! If my budget was unlimited I’d die for a Percival lafer anything. Also, I'm debating a rug in the dining room and welcome any suggestions there.  

Fun fact about the house: it was allegedly designed by architect Jack Portman for Don Everly in 1967 and later belonged to Erin Everly, who lived here with Axl Rose in the early '90s. I'm considering replacing the big pendant globe in the dining room with a wasabi-style pendant, but it feels like such an original piece of the house’s history that I’m hesitant.

I posted on a mid-century modern subreddit for suggestions, but it turned into a judgmental pile-on. Many people couldn’t help but let me know that my rug is hideous and a total disgrace to planet earth pretty much. I’m not here for that— just for creative, positive input to help make this home truly unique! 

This is our first home together after 12 years of medical training for my husband (M35) and I (F29) grinding in finance.

(Spoilers),"Itachi, one of the big fan favorites in Naruto. From his mysterious and violent past, his association in the Akatsuki, and his relation as a big brother to sasuke are all interesting character traits that made him appealing from
His first appearance. 


Most people here know about the Uchiha Massacre. It was an event where Itachi (rectonned to have also been partaken by Obito) killed all the Uchiha as they were planning a coup against the leaf. 

During this attack, Itachi kills his and Sasuke’s parents. 

What happens next is the point of this post. 

After forcing his brother to watch his parents die, he puts him in an illusion that forces him to rewatch their deaths for 24 HOURS if I remember correctly.

 Later on in the story sasuke confronts Itachi again, and again, Itachi makes him rewatch the massacre and killing of his parents, but for an even longer period of time.

The entire twist about Itachi that was introduced later was that he was acting on the orders of Danzo and Hiruzen. He asks for Sasuke to be spared and taken care of. obito is also seen taking some of the blame as he helps Itachi do it. Itachi’s best friend says passively it probably is the best thing to be done to keep the peace. 

Whenever I bring up this event, people always say the same thing that even though it was evil, the Uchiha would’ve destabilized the region and resulted in more deaths- this is something I do agree with. The Uchiha were one of the strongest clans in the leaf and a war between the Uchiha and the Hyuga+ the leaf would’ve made it ripe for outside attack. 

Kishimoto did a good job explaining why the coup happened and involved enough political intrigue for the decision to have a kind of realistic film over the event, as opposed to it being grimdark cruelty. 

However- if this was the case and Itachi is a good guy like we’re told- we see him crying as he kills his parents…

Why the fuck did he put Sasuke in a mind torture chamber? There was literally no reason for him to ludovico his brother at the most impressionable age of his life with the haunting images of his parents being killed. 

And what annoys me most is that as the story continues, kishimoto obviously agrees because neither Itachi nor Sasuke *ever* bring up that specific point and interaction between them again. They bring up the overall massacre, but Sasuke never is like “but the worst thing is that he made me rewatch it multiple times” when he confronts Itachi and fights him in shippuden he’s not angrily asking Itachi why he made him suffer beyond what was suffered already. Kishimoto kind of… makes the specific act of the massacre that has the highest level of evil coalesce into the overall massacre itself. 

So instead of Sasuke being damaged by what he suffered from Itachi’s mind abuse, Sasuke is now kind of more angry at the massacre happening-

Which is perfect, because when obito is like oh it was danzo’s order not Itachi’s, Sasuke should’ve been like “okay the order went out but Itachi still made me watch my parents die in hell for three days straight” not 

“Oh okay konoha needs to die now.” 

And of course you can be like “who’s to say he doesn’t blame everything on danzo, including the genjutsu hell?” And that’s the thing about writing- you have to approach events like this as someone reading it outside of the author. 

Because you need to write out reactions of your characters going through the things you write about. It really doesn’t make sense that Sasuke never talks to at the least, Itachi about his reasoning as to why he would do that to younger brother. 

Ofc to this question people will say “oh Itachi did it because Sasuke had to become strong to protect konoha” but it’s like.. damn Itachi that’s a very severe overreaction to that goal, when if you believe hatred is the pathway to strength, then maybe you didn’t have to make it even worse by forcing Sasuke through more mental trauma. 

Then that excuse even kind of flies out the window as we find out Itachi has very little agency in this decision to begin with, so we can read Itachi’s statement to Sasuke and even his future reasoning as a lame excuse, as Sasuke becoming stronger wasn’t the primary reason to begin with.

I’ve always maintained that I’m fine with the political recton, but I think more focus should’ve been put towards how flawed Itachi is as a character. Instead of making him this overt nice guy, focus on showing him as someone who as sociopathic tendencies and while he’s capable of love, due to the fact he was a killer from the age of 4, show that Itachi uses violence and death and fear to interact with the world around him as opposed to like, again, making him a loving older brother who got put in a bad spot. 

It’s because of this that it’s so jarring seeing Sasuke in shippuden with edo Itachi, as I think that was a good time for Sasuke to really ask Itachi why he did what he did to Sasuke personally- not to their clan or parents, but why Itachi took the extra step of forcing him to see their parents get murdered for days on end. 

It could’ve been a thing where maybe fugaku put Itachi in a genjutsu during Itachi’s youth and forced him to watch something horrific for three days in order to harden him (cycle of abuse) or SOMETHING- because I think it’s unfair to the narrative and the characters involved to have such a big specific action taken, then kind of brushed under the rug because of how evil it is compared to the fan reaction of said character. 

It’s a similar thing with the Deep- the deep is a *rapist*. While he does get his comeuppance with the gill thing, I think the overall marketing of the deep outside the show and how he’s kind of this comic relief character slightly now within the show belittled the fact that his first big moment in his arc was raping starlight. 

I haven’t watched the show since season 2 so maybe he apologizes for it? Idk. 

I just wish more authors and writers took the time to really focus on the emotional reactions characters have to the things other characters do to them beyond the “oh u did bad thing to me!” Have some nuance, have manipulation and gaslighting be used, do something to really cement the trauma for said characters which makes their turn against that trauma feel even more worthwhile. 

It would’ve been amazing in Boruto if Sasuke and Naruto had a convo about Sasuke’s abuse from Itachi, and how a part of Sasuke’s own distance from Sarada was a fear that he would justify hurting her psychologically the same way in order to secure her life in the future. Maybe have Sasuke talk about how he battles with his feelings towards Itachi, dancing between loving him and hating him, due to what he’s done.

Instead after the edo tensei Itachi is seen by most characters as an overall good person, despite the fact no good person, even one under evil orders, would take the time to specifically give their younger sibling a mind based illusion where they are forced to see their eldest sibling murder their parents for at least a day- on two separate occasions.

1gkap09,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1gkap09/i_am_ok_i_have_learned_not_to_care/,I am OK. I have learned not to care.,"I have posted with throw away accounts over the years expressing my frustration from being in a dead bedroom marriage and looking forward to retirement and divorce.  Me M58 and wife F59.  The origin of our dead bedroom stems from our dislike of each other.  We had an active sex life, but my wife would always seem to use sex as a reward / punishment for what was going on in our relationship.  I gave up asking or trying to initiate sex knowing that would be turned down and only cause frustration and bitterness.

In my previous post I have talked about my commitment to my kids and the financial hardship we would face if we needed to support two households after a divorce.  As my kids college graduation dates get closer and the prospect of them being able to go out into the world (close to debt free) and get decent paying jobs to suport themselves and me being free of my wife -  I am getting excited.

I have learned not to argue with her - I don't care.  If she says it's night when it's day, I have learned to say OK.  I have learned to tune out to her gripe sessions and truly have become mindfull of everything I do.  Anything she complains about me doing I have never done again.  Dish in sink - haven't in years as she went on a rage about it once with me.  She leaves dishes in the sink all the time - I don't care. Kids leave a dish in the sink - I wash it or put in dishwasher hopefully before she notices.  Both kids away in college / grad school and only come home on breaks so its a little less stressfull ensuring the bear isn't woken.

I have projects I work on in the basement - I enjoy puttering around the house or mowing the lawn until bed time every evening.  I rarely visit with friends or family as she always has bad things to say about them and I feel guilty tuning her out and not defending them.

I get up at 5:00 am on weekends and go fishing (just sit at the lake and watch the sun rise with my coffee and dog) home by 9:00 as she gets up around 10:00 and if I am not doing some kind of yard work / home project she will go off on me. 

I feel like I am at the end of a long prison sentence and I am getting excited about how life will be.  I plan on buying a large RV and two large boats.  We live near a nice lake and have a vacation home on the coast, both are perfect for boat living.  Rather than fight over ownership of our properties I would like to transfer to my kids via a living trust. My plan is to live on the boats and RV for a few years and travel with my dog.

There is no going back to any type of real relationship with my wife as I have learned I really don't like the person she is.  She talks bad about everyone, complains about everything.  I am by no means the perfect husband and take full responsiblity of where my marriage has ended up.  I am very proud of my kids - both scholar athletes in long term healthy relationships.  I have been able to talk to them as their mother goes off on them over little things (glad we got through the spilling drinks phase when they were younger).  I have explained that she does love them and she just came from a family that argued and complained about everything.  

The lack of sex and intimacy with my wife has strengthened my relationship with myself and with my kids.  I just wanted to share that I have learned to be at peace without sex with my wife.  I have learned to truly take care of myself - emotionally and physically.  I am not seething with anger or sexually frustrated anymore.  If by some chance she asked for sex - I would definitely be down for it.

1gkaozq,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1gkaozq/im_out/,I’m Out,"It’s been a long road and while I appreciate the things I have learned, the Orthodox Church is not the more mystical, less legalistic and accepting church it was made out to be. 

I grew up evangelical but became an atheist in high school. In early adulthood I had an experience and started a spiritual search. I was intrigued by Christian mysticism, something the evangelical church dismissed. After learning about the Jesus prayer, I had to learn about this “ancient church.” The Orthodox Way was the first book I read and I was enamored with the emphasis on love, the subtle universalism, the saints, the lack of penal substitution.  

After years of reading I worked up the courage to go to an Orthodox church and immediately enrolled as an inquirer. But something was off. The converts were weird. No one looked you in the eye, no one talked to you, everyone carried themselves with a “humbler than thou” type of attitude, and they all dressed like Russian peasants even though we were in a Greek church.

The services were long and repetitive. During the service I couldn’t help but ask if God really cared how many times a prayer was repeated. Kissing the Bible. People reaching out to touch the priest’s robes. Kissing the priest’s hand. I was starting to feel like I was in a cult. 

One day I met with my priest. I asked him why we fast. He said “I don’t know, because we’re told to.” I was thrown for a loop. I thought this was a church with reasons for everything? 

Then one day my priest could barely give a sermon on Jesus healing the hemorrhaging woman. Stuttering. He couldn’t just come out and say it. I looked around at the women in the room and felt embarrassed. The prudishness was killing me. The hatred for the human experience. 

Eventually I was ready to be baptized. My Godfather was picked at random, someone I barely knew. We met for coffee and all he could talk about was the “tyranny of pronouns.” I was tired of the politics. At this time I started to see Josiah Trenham and Peers. My stomach turned. I couldn’t take my girlfriend to this church, I wouldn’t take my kids. To this place?

Then the priest couldn’t baptize me. It had to be on Pascha, no other day. But I travel for work. I was going to be gone. He didn’t care, couldn’t help me. He had the keys to the kingdom and he was shaking them in front of my face. 

Then I moved. I found a new priest in a new city. In the catechism class they laughed at the homeless. People raised their hands to ask questions they already knew the answers to. All dressed like peasants. I couldn’t take it. Found a new church. They said I’d have to do catechism all over again. That was it. 

They act as if they own God. As if you weren’t truly baptized if you didn’t get dunked three times or the incantation wasn’t said correctly. 

Is God that small? 

The obsession with control. The obsession with sin. I could go on forever but this post is already long enough. 

We spend so much time focused on sin that there is no room for love. 

I’ve since found an Episcopal church, couldn’t be happier. It doesn’t have the smells and bells, but it’s raw and the people there care for each other and their communities. There’s no purity tests. And I, a baptized Christian, can take communion! Thank God for that. ",18,1730824093.0,exorthodox,13,0.95,False

Hello everyone, I recently purchased a new home. It's newly renovated and in a prime location. However, the previous homeowners left the house a mess; apparently, they were in a rush and left a lot of their crap behind. While tossing out their stuff, some notebooks, scraps of paper, and other junk fell out of a box, and you can say curiosity got the best of me. I decided to read through some of it. The first couple of notepads were filled with notes and electrical stuff—I guess the previous owner was an electrician or something. However, right before I was ready to call it quits and toss it all out, I came across a notebook with a short story in it. I noticed that throughout all the notebooks and pads, there were random jots and blurbs. Some of the writing is rushed and hard to read, but as I piece this story together, I decided I'd share it here! It’s all a mess though; a lot of writing was probably done in the spur of the moment. Sadly, we never got to meet the sellers at closing, so we won't be able to give this back; they apparently had already left the state before we closed.

Anyway, I'll be releasing the story as I compile it. Let me know what you think, and if you think you know the authors, please let me know! I’d love to return their work. Anyway, here it is!

Chapter 1: The Dream

My cheeks twitched slightly as the black haze of sleep started to lift. A soft groan left my throat as I stretched my neck to a more comfortable position. I heard my wife moving as well—the comfortable shuffling sound that bed sheets make. She just couldn't seem to get comfortable though, as the grogginess cleared up and sleep was leaving me entirely. “Are you okay?” I mumbled, putting my arm around her, annoyed that my sleep was ruined. My waking ears kept twitching as they focused in on the sound. It was a soft shuffling sound—swish-pull-step-swish-pull-step. Maybe my wife Selene was going to the bathroom, I thought, as I gently tightened my arms around her warm, tender frame.

My eyes jutted open, and my body tensed; I felt my skin crawl as my brain shocked itself awake. My mind began spinning with realization—even if she was shuffling to the bathroom, our master bathroom is right here. Right in front of the bed. That isn't much of a walk. And she's lying right next to me. In my arms. Gently snoring. Not moving a single inch. My ears zoned in. Was this a mouse? An animal? No... No, this wasn't a mouse—it wasn't any kind of small animal! I don't have to be an audio expert with perfect hearing to know that this noise is not animalistic at all.

After a few seconds, I realized we were being burglarized. Someone was in my home right now at this very moment. My home is a ranch—everything is one floor. Selene and I are first-time homeowners and have been living here in perfect suburbia for five months—a stark contrast to our chaotic environment in the city. The house is practically open-concept, with a hallway from the living room leading straight to our master bedroom. Admittedly, most sounds breaking the silence tend to scare us in our newfound environment. Our refrigerator loves popping out random ice cubes like mini gunshots, and Selene's been having it the hardest with random noises. This wouldn't be the first time something crazy has happened to us.

And now I heard what sounded like shuffling in the living room.

The creak and groan of our wood floors matched with the constant slow footsteps. It sounded like someone was searching around for something in short distances—an item that kept eluding them. I heard the pillows on the couch bump around and the coffee table move as my ears continued to zone in. My heart started to pound heavily, and I felt a tightness around my chest.

Slowly, and as quietly as possible, I leaned over to my nightstand and opened it to grab my handgun. As panic continued to swell in my chest, my wife started shifting and waking up, whether due to me or the intruder I don't know, and I quickly shushed her with my hand over her mouth. She's feisty and immediately gave me an angry look, probably more upset to be jarred awake. Selene tends to jump to conclusions without thinking— a headstrong woman with a strong personality, but she's also an amazing partner and knows exactly what to do when I'm serious. She motions to speak, but stays quiet once she notices the gun in my hand.

""There's someone in our living room, or at least I think,"" I whisper as lowly as I can, slowly and quietly heading over to unlock the bedroom door. I carefully opened the door, leaving it slightly ajar to avoid making noise, and made my way down the hallway. My wife was sitting on the bed with her phone in hand, probably calling the police.

In hindsight, I should have stayed in the bedroom and let the police handle this situation; however, I can be quite a brave idiot.

My heart was pounding hard as the warm sensation of blood rushed to my face. Growing up in the city, I found myself in many dangerous situations, but I never could have realized how much more terrifying it was to have an intruder in your home in the early morning. As I crept closer, I saw the hunched back of a figure wearing a black tank top and baggy black shorts. My coffee table blocked the view from his calves down. The figure had pale white skin—seemingly Caucasian, maybe even albino—and its bent-over frame had its hands in the crevices of my couch. It wore either a tight black beanie or maybe it had a thick buzzcut; the distance was too far to be certain. I wondered what it expected to find in my couch; certainly it wasn't looking for dust bunnies or loose change.

Slowly walking closer, I aimed my firearm at the intruder; the floor creaked under me. He stood up quickly, startled, his head whipping in my direction to look directly at me as the rest of him slowly turned around. As he turned, everything about him seemed to shift, almost shimmering in the light streaming through the bay window blinds, as if he was made out of fine silver-colored sand. His pale skin tone shimmered to a tan tone, and a tattoo morphed on his chest and arms, mimicking the same tattoos on my upper body. I froze, staring at my doppelganger. His body was no longer albino in a black outfit but instead was shirtless, wearing sweatpants, with my messy bed head and hairline—and holding something...

I faced myself. I was holding a firearm, and he was holding what I perceived to be a firearm, but something about it looked off. I took a step. He—I?—took a step. I walked toward him. He did the same. I stopped a short distance away, and he mimicked me. My chest pounded as my reflection's face grew slightly red. I can only imagine that was how I looked. My breathing was calm yet heavy. So was his, but without the sound of breaths being taken. I took a step backward, aimed at him, and he mimicked each movement until he backed into the coffee table and fell.

I took this opportunity and fired off six bullets into him, five making their mark. I almost feared I might feel the pain myself.

My wife ran down the hall to see the scene unfolding. “Please tell me you're seeing what I'm seeing,” I pleaded. My wife confirmed my sanity. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what the hell is that? What the hell is this? What is going on?”

“CALM DOWN,” my mirror image screamed, and I fired two more rounds into him.

The silence stood heavy in the air.

“That was not your voice,” my wife stated as we watched blood pour out of him—more like sand flowing out of a vial than liquid. My body lurched forward as my name, “CASSIAN!” screamed out. My neck was punctured by two rows of teeth, and my doppelganger was standing back up.

Fear immediately struck my heart as I went to grab the being behind me and—BEEP BEEP BEEP—my morning alarm was going off. My heart was pounding, my body soaked in sweat. My wife groaned, “Turn off the alarm, Cassian.” I turned off the alarm and stood up—the pounding in my chest dissipating as I realized that all I went through was a vivid dream. I checked the magazine to my firearm and counted fifteen bullets. All was well… Just a horrible dream. I went to the bathroom, washed my face, and wrote every detail I remembered down as my wife woke up. I began telling Selene about the dream as I jotted it down in my brown notepad. Reliving it through speech actually helped with jotting everything down.

“That's got to mean something; maybe we should play the lottery?” Selene joked as she went to shower.

Ahh, Selene. She believes in astrology, mythical things, and that rocks and essential oils can influence a person or put them to sleep, but she won’t believe me.

We got prepared for work. I normally work remotely, but today I was heading down to Philadelphia for a survey. As I put my coat on and made my way toward the kitchen to make my morning coffee before heading to my car, I decided to take a moment and stare into the living room. Everything looked utterly normal. Nothing changed. No evidence of an attack.

Nothing.

Until something shiny caught my eye…

And that, my friends, is what he has written down on the first page of this notebook. The next pages seem to be notes jotted down for an office in 16th and Market Street; no idea where that’s at though. If you'd like to hear more of this story, let me know; I think it's kind of creepy because I can personally visualize it a bit since, ya know, I live here and obviously this house was his inspiration.

Edit: Hey, I decided to peek around the living room, and I noticed a hole in the floor—it looks to be patched by some wood putty and revarnished.. refinished? I don't know. Maybe I’m being paranoid, but could bullet holes be that easy to fix? I never owned a gun before, I only know about them from movies. Maybe it’s actually just a knot in the wood, and I’m being paranoid. I think I’ll be reading a bit more of these journals in case this is something else. I don't know; let me know what you think.

1gkak8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/1gkak8v/unknown_anxiety_or_stress_spiked_me/,Unknown Anxiety or Stress Spiked Me,"So i was talking with an old work friend. Use to be a customer but we remained friends after he left his company. He called me about a possible project opportunity (im unemployed currently). So naturally I was excited but nervous because this person can be really fast in how he talks and assumes a lot without going into detail. In regard to IT related projects details matter. Anyways, then in addition to that we started talking about my old job and old feelings came up. Context i had to quit due to unprofessional behavior from upper management. No i am not a diva. It’s one of those you take it on the chin one too many times at a certain point it’s unprofessional and unacceptable behavior. That said, i realized I was feeling unable to breathe easy or that out of body feeling. That happened but i didn’t put two and two together. Then, once I am off the phone i look at my sugar and it’s skyrocketed. First time
This has happened since being diagnosed. Where it’s clearly related to the conversation. Because my overnight and morning bs was normal. 

Anyways figured I would share this story as an example of anxiety or stress that you don’t realize in the moment might cause a huge spike. 

Now I need to go for a walk. 

Morning Food: All I had was coffee. This spike is not normal at all. 

EDIT: my friend and I had a great conversation overall. He wasn’t the issue. I am learning more about myself and realized that I get anxious about things i don’t have all the information or potentially previous experiences that have happened that were less than ideal. I am a 32M and a new father just recently. My daughter is amazing perfectly healthy and barely any trouble at all. Maybe that’s part of it.

1gkah1e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkah1e,Review week 11/5/2024,"Marked spoiler to avoid comments about my toppings. 

Review week 11/5/2024

Peanut butter blossom 🌸 8/10 - my review is altered because of the frosting, I think the teeny tiny dollop we are made to put on there is really stupid. Give me alllll that fudge frosting! Love the gooey peanut butter cookie that’s rolled in sugar for a nice texture on the outside. Very rich! 

Butter cake 🧈 2/10 (not pictured) - it’s basic yellow pound cake with a gross layer of butter on the top. The vanilla bean whipped cream and sugar crystals are the only good thing about this. Didn’t like it the first time either so I only tasted the batch we made. 

Strawberry cupcake 🍓 8.5/10 - this is one of my favorite fruity cookies! The strawberry cream cheese frosting tastes like strawberry cream cheese straight from the tub! This reminds me of school days when I’d eat an untoasted blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese. The cookie itself isn’t as fluffy as last time though. Not so ‘cupcakey’ which is sad. 

New York Cheesecake 🗽 6.8/10 - ehhh nothing spectacular about this one. Love the cream cheese frosting and graham cracker cookie though, it’s just not WOWING me, yknow? That’s why I like the fruit toppings on the other cheesecake cookies. My cookie was a little more underdone than usual too, and I love the medium-rare cookies! But it was very gummy. 

Original M&M 🍪 7/10 - this may be a ‘boring’ cookie, but it’s still delicious! Sometimes simple is best. The thing about m&m’s is they stay crunchy after baking, so there’s this amazing crunch when you take a bite. I prefer the peanut butter bases to the original cookie (it’s exactly the same as milk chocolate chip), but still a solid cookie. 

Oatmeal raisin 🍇 6.5/10 - warm, homey, would pair well with a cup of coffee for a quick breakfast treat. I wish there were more raisins in mine. The reason this has a lower rating is because I can easily make or buy these at home or in store. Tastes just like a Costco oatmeal cookie… that being said, a rich brown sugary taste with hints of cinnamon. ",2,1730823538.0,CrumblCookies,9,0.58,False

I'm looking for an app to move from AITA, and Flighty looks like a promising candidate. As far as I understand, it has a few missing features:

1. Import historical flights from AITA
2. Timeline (helped me to plan my next actions)
3. Fun stats / achievements & Leaderboard (I love gamification, it engages more)
4. Connections / social features (invite for a coffee etc.) 

If you have been using Flighty after AITA, how has your experience been so far and what are you missing the most? Does Flighty worth the money they are asking for?
