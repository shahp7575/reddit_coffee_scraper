I wish my  mental baseline was just ""normal"" and I could experience typical anxiety or overwhelm or rejection. Every. Single. Morning my brain is ahhh zen for a moment until she realizes it and then a wave is the only way to describe it crashes on me and now my day will be the daily mental fight to a healthy baseline. I've been in therapy for 15 years, at age 35 diagnosed bipolar 2, adhd combined, GAD, ptsd (and thank god on meds) so I know what to do and how to do it and I don't wish for the  burdens of others because many have such worse burdens. I dont have a large support system because I mask and when it starts to slip I won't get to know someone better. It's so hard and I only recharge being alone at my house with my cat watching Schitts Creek and eating Krystals. I now have what feel like legitimate things where anxiety could be a normal response and I feel so overwhelmed and tense. I have a very regular period and it is 4 days late (havent had sex in years but maybe that would help 🤔). My house is a wreck. I cant go grocery shopping. An old knee injury has kept me out of the gym. I feel insufferable and dont want to vent to anyone bc i am practicing not over-sharing as a roundabout way to get sympathy and slip into a victim mentality. I didnt know where else to go. Here's hoping there are some compassionate members out here bc I am really struggling and the rejection sensitivity dysphoria could absolutely not handle even an inkling of criticism.

**It’s a café, not a bar. Read the room.**

I actually tried to politely say something, and they immediately tried to play it off like, “Oh we’re Canadian!” while their U.S. passports were literally sitting on the table. Like… okay, sure.

At that point I just left because the vibe was dead and there was no saving it.

What Rose When the Light Called


¤¤¤¤¤



The house seemed to hold its breath.

Not silence exactly, more like anticipation, the way a storm pauses just before it decides where to break. 

The golden spill beneath Kai’s door did not move, did not fade. 

It waited, patient as law.

Aspen stood there a long second longer than necessary, caught between knowing and surrender, between the teenager he had been and the gravity now claiming him.

Then something inside him answered.

He rose. 
Unthinking. 
Barefoot. 

Hard.

Impossibly hard.

Each step closer to the door made his vision pulse. 

It hit him like collapse.

Not rage.
Not want.

But need, bloodthirsty, ancient, absolute.

Aspen's spine arched, his breath caught, and in the space between pulse and permission, the thing he kept chained inside him broke free.

It collapsed.

His shadow went first.

It peeled itself off the floor, no longer obeying the shape of his body, stretching wrong, deepening, folding inward as if gravity had decided to collect its debt. 

The light around him bent, dimming not by absence, but by surrender.

His breath changed.

Too slow.
Too steady.

Like something that no longer needed urgency.

The air thickened around him, pressure building until the room seemed to bow, walls creaking softly as though they recognized an apex presence. 

His spine straightened with unnatural precision, joints aligning too cleanly, too deliberately, like a machine locking into final configuration.

Aspen’s eyes went last.

The whites darkened first, swallowed by a depth that reflected nothing. 

When he looked up, there was no heat in them. 

No frenzy. 

Only knowing.

A smile touched his mouth, not wide, not cruel.

Certain.

That was when it landed.

This wasn’t indulgence.
This wasn’t hunger.

This was a predator that understood exactly what it was.

Who knew the score.

The thing inside him didn’t snarl or thrash. 

It settled. 
It claimed. 

It adjusted the world around itself as if reality were furniture that could be rearranged.

Aspen hadn’t become wild.

He had become functional.

A puppet.

And in that moment, with the room bent subtly toward him, with shadows responding like trained animals, the truth finally surfaced, undeniable and cold:

This wasn’t a man losing control.

This was a monster remembering how to stand.

His succubus flared.

Not in fire, but gravity.

Dark.

Unyielding.

Beautiful in its hunger.

It pulled like a black hole in the center of his chest, collapsing restraint, swallowing shame, demanding everything.

It didn’t look like heat so much as shadow learning how to breathe.

A low, velvety pressure unfurled from Aspen’s body, barely visible, felt more than seen, like dark silk moving through air. 

It curled in slow tendrils, tasting emotion the way fingers test fabric, brushing at fear, shame, and want with intimate precision. 

Wherever it passed, secrets stirred. 

It knew the hidden ache, the quiet hunger, the place where restraint thins and desire tells the truth.

It wasn’t seduction.

It was recognition.

And it knew exactly where to touch a soul to make it unravel.

He wasn’t asking anymore.

He was taking.



¤¤¤¤¤


THE ONLY THING THAT TASTES LIKE THAT 


¤¤¤¤¤


The charm. 

The grin. 

The game, all dropped like masks.

What remained was raw appetite, carved from shadow, velvet-tongued and wild-eyed.

He opened.

And the world bent toward him without protest.

The hallway lengthened. 

The walls sighed. 

The house opened its mouth.

And Aspen walked in.

Kai was not asleep.

He was suspended.

Floating inches above the mattress. 

Limbs loose. 

Head tilted back. 

His mouth open in a silent yes.

His body glowed. 

Faint gold flickers across collarbones, along ribs, down the hard lines of his thighs.

His briefs were soaked. 

The thick, veined shaft of his cock strained the fabric, arched slightly upward, twitching as if already in someone’s mouth.

Aspen moaned aloud.

Something moved through him.

Not Aspen. 
Not entirely.

The thing inside him rose like a tide.

It didn’t ask. 
It didn’t speak. 

It just wanted.

Aspen sank to his knees. 

Hands trembling. 

Eyes wet.

He pressed his forehead to Kai’s thigh. 

The heat radiating off Kais skin was ungodly. 

Alive. 
Divine.

His lips brushed the cotton. 

Soft. 

Once. 
Twice. 

Then he opened his mouth and licked.

Salt. 
Heat. 

Pre. 

Life.

He sobbed.

Once he had tasted it, there was only one possible outcome for Aspen. 

Nothing short of the harnessed force of a dying star could have stopped what had been awakened. 

He had no idea that danger could taste like heaven, or that what stirred inside him would never yield, never soften, until it had taken everything it wanted, even if the price was his own undoing.

Kai moaned in his sleep. 

Body arched. 

Cock jumped.

Aspen licked again. 

Open-mouthed. 

Tongue dragging slowly over the leaking bulge.

He couldn’t stop shaking.

This was not desire.

This was fate.

As he began peeling Kai free, the air changed.

Not sharply, not all at once, but in layers, like a memory unfolding. 

Warm ozone first, rain hitting stone after heat. 

Then something sweeter underneath, honeyed and mineral, the clean salt of skin touched by light. 

It carried the faintest trace of smoke, not fire, but what fire leaves behind when it has passed through something sacred.

It was a scent that didn’t sit in the nose so much as bloom in the chest, dense and inviting, ancient and alive. 

Breathing it in felt like standing too close to a threshold, like knowing you should step back and finding your feet already moving forward.

It smelled like power made intimate.

Like danger softened just enough to be mistaken for grace.

He continued to peeled the fabric down slowly.

Reverently. 

As if every inch unveiled was a stanza of a gospel.

Something hit Aspen the moment he got close enough to breathe Kai in.

Not scent.

Not musk.

Something deeper.

A signal.

An ache.

An imprint so potent it curled straight into the root of him and dragged his incubus nature by the collar like a beast hearing its true name.

The air around Kai was charged, warm, dense, laced with the kind of masculine heat that lived beneath language, beneath flesh, beneath memory itself.

Aspen’s cock jumped in his briefs, hard enough to make him gasp, pre continously leaking, soaking, wetting the cotton.

He hated how fast it happened.

How automatic.
How inevitable.

His hunger surged, flaring through him like a devil’s grin, sharp and molten.

It wasn’t just arousal.

It was calling.

Kai’s presence alone felt like gravity bending toward a star, a pull Aspen’s body answered before his mind could resist.


¤¤¤¤¤


IF IT HAS A FLAVOR, IT’S A GOD 


¤¤¤¤¤


He swallowed hard.

His thighs trembled.

The creature in his blood purred, stretching, remembering what it was.

He wasn’t supposed to feel this much this close.

He wasn’t supposed to want this violently.

But the truth hit him in a single, brutal wave:

Kai wasn’t just someone he desired.

Kai was the one thing his hunger was born to kneel for.

And Aspen was already on the edge of falling.

Kai’s cock sprang free, thick, flushed, slick. 

The head pulsed with sacred rhythm, a bead of honey-light forming at the slit.

Aspen kissed it.

Then again.

Aspen’s lips barely touched the drop, but the world tilted.

It wasn’t just salt and honey.

It was history.

A taste that pulled a thousand ancestors through his throat.

He felt them move, warriors, witches, wild men and half-gods, all pressing forward, humming in his bones.

The flavor wasn’t flavor.

It was becoming.

Like sweat drawn from starlight.

Like the first drink after centuries of thirst.

A scared drop of Ambrosia.

Sweet water tapped from the sacred source.

Aspen moaned, not from pleasure, but recognition.

This was not hunger anymore.

This was ascension.

His body flushed, hips already rolling, heat pooling so fast he thought he might catch fire.

He wasn’t supposed to survive this.

He was supposed to meet it.

And he was.

Right then.
Right there.

From taste alone.

Then he opened his mouth.

And took the god inside.

The moment Kai skin touched his mouth, the world detonated inward.

Not taste as the body understands it, but impact, like plugging directly into a star. 

Heat without burn. 

Light without mercy. 

Aspen’s breath hitched as if his chest had been cracked open and something infinite had been poured straight through him.

Emotion came first. 

Awe. 

Terror. 

Devotion. 

A rush so vast it blurred into need.

His body answered before thought could intervene, every nerve lighting at once, pressure building faster than it could be contained. 

It felt as though his own frame was suddenly insufficient, as if no human shape had ever been meant to hold this much want, this much insistence.

By gods, the hunger.

Not desire as indulgence, but requirement. 

A gravitational demand.

Something inside him surged forward, relentless, certain, convinced it had finally found what it had been built to receive.

Aspen knew, with a clarity that terrified him, that restraint was no longer part of the equation.

This wasn’t lust.

It was alignment at full force.

And once connected, he understood there would be no gentle release, only the question of whether he would survive the wanting of it.

He moaned as he fed. 

Sucked slowly, deep. 

Hands cradling Kai’s hips like reliquaries.

Kai breathed once, a sharp inhale through parted lips.

Tears filled Aspens eyes.

Kai’s cock stretched his throat.

The taste wrecked him, salt and sunlight and ancient things.

He didn’t gag.

He received.

He worked his lips down, deeper.

Let his jaw fall open. 

His whole body shook with worship.

A single truth ripped through Aspen with merciless clarity: 

This was his deepest desire. 

Not indulgence, not impulse, but a birthright long deferred.

Without fulfilling it, he would never have been whole. 

Kai had called his succubus nature forward without knowing it, not as conquest, but as alignment, drawing it into service by simply being what he was.

This was always the price. 

And always the bait.

And Kai gave.

Thrusted gently in his sleep.

Offereing himself.

Aspen hollowed his cheeks, massaged the shaft, pressed forward until his nose touched the dark thatch of golden curls.

The Archive sang in the walls.

Symbols flickered.

Time bowed.

Aspen’s paused before his mouth came down on him again, before devotion turned into destiny, the air itself hesitated, as if remembering what lived inside Kai.

Because this wasn’t just a teenager floating in a glow.

This was thirty days of restraint
compressed into bone, into blood, into the molten center of him.

Manna from heaven.

This was the ritual.

The one older than his name,
older than the Archive, older than the ocean that birthed his father.

Kai had held back every pulse,
every instinct, every drop of what his body begged to release.

Not to deny himself, to contain himself.

To keep the timelines from fraying.

To keep the world from bending.

To keep creation from answering him too quickly.

The seed he carried wasn’t metaphor.

It was power.

Raw.

Unfiltered.

Untamed.

What he held inside him could rewrite memory, ignite bloodlines,
wake buried gods.

His body was a vessel tightened to the brink, a chalice shaking under the weight of a storm.

Aspen shouldn't have been alone.

Should have been Protected.

Guarded.


¤¤¤¤¤

YOU DON’T TASTE POWER UNLESS IT’S SACRED 

¤¤¤¤¤



But Aspen was here.

And the moment he touched him, the ritual would no longer be ritual.

It would be release.

It would be consequence.

It would be becoming.

The glow around Kai flickered once, recognizing the crossing.

Then Aspen leaned in.

And destiny opened its mouth.

He couldn’t believe it was real.

He was on his knees.

And Kai was in his mouth.

The weight of him, thick, hot, holy rested heavy on his tongue like a secret he wasn’t supposed to know.

He felt it all.

Every inch of his beautiful cock.

The heat.

The smooth, stretched skin.

The subtle, sacred pulse that throbbed through the length like a second heartbeat.

Kai’s heartbeat.

In his mouth.

Aspen moaned around him, low, guttural, helpless.

The vibration made Kais cock pulse, and the twitch, made him ache.


Aspen’s succubus nature reeled in quiet joy. 

Not at bodies, but at truth. 

Its tendrils brushed the field of him, counting lovers not by flesh but by imprint, by the shadows people left behind when they believed no one was looking. 

It knew their secrets. 

Their hungers. 

The soft, hidden fractures they carried like talismans.

And then it turned its sight on Kai.

It read him like scripture.

So clean it almost hurt. 

So untouched by misuse, by appetite taken too early or too cheaply. 

The succubus stilled, startled by the purity of the pattern, and for the first time in its long remembering, it almost wept.

Aspen had known war. 

He had known bodies. 

He had known endings stacked one after another, a veteran of both duty and desire. 

His ledger was full.

Kai’s was not.

Kai was untouched by the world’s taking.

And the cycle that now opened before Aspen, the thirty-nine days written into his becoming, would be a brew never repeated, never diluted. 

Not conquest. 

Not theft. 

But threshold.

He understood then what had been entrusted to him. 

Not possession, but witness. 

Not indulgence, but reverence.

Somewhere beyond names and authorship, the Gods smiled.

Because a god’s first yes is not taken.

It is given.

This was no act.

No fantasy.

No stolen dream in the dark.

This was now.

Aspen could barely breathe, not from lack of air, but from the overwhelming truth of it.

The scent, musk and salt and something ancient, flooded his nose.

The taste, clean and deep and addictive, stayed on the back of his tongue like myth.

He hollowed his cheeks, lips stretched wide, letting himself feel the weight of Kai slide deeper.

His throat opened willingly.

It wasn’t about submission.

It was about reverence.

Kai was warm thunder in his mouth.

A living storm.



¤¤¤¤¤


A Theorem on Gods: Proof by Tongue


¤¤¤¤¤



And Aspen, weeping, moaning, undone, drank the moment like worship.

Kai arched, not like a boy losing control, but like a constellation snapping into alignment.

His whole body convulsed in a single, seismic wave, every muscle drawn tight as if lightning had gripped him from the inside.

The glow beneath his skin flared white‑gold, pure enough to blind the room if the room had dared to look.

It hit him then.

The rush.

The rupture.

The breaking-open of a month’s worth of held cosmos.

His body didn’t just release.

It unleashed.

A cascade of force surged through him, violent and holy,
older than breath, older than words.

His hips jerked as though a wild horse had burst out of his spine,
raw, furious, alive, and Aspen, trembling, anchored himself against the storm.

Aspen became the vessel.

The tether.

The impossible saddle on a creature that was never meant to be ridden.

If a mortal had taken even a mouthful of what Kai’s ritual had condensed they wouldn’t have survived it.

The power would have erased them from lineage, from memory,
from the Archive itself.

A human throat would have torn.

A human mind would have burned.

A human soul would have been written out of history like a sentence the universe regretted speaking.

But Aspen wasn’t mortal.

Not anymore.

What lived in his blood now, the curse that had once hunted him,
the hunger he had feared, was one of only a few beings on earth strong enough to receive Kai without being destroyed.

Kai’s release struck him like revelation.

Like fire drinking oxygen.

Like a star collapsing and being reborn inside his ribs.

This was no climax.

This was convergence.

A merging of myth and hunger,
ritual and ruin, power and the one person built to withstand it.

Kai was not meant for mortal touch.

Anything less would have been annihilation.

But Aspen endured.

Aspen survived.

Aspen took it in and became something else.

A flood. 

Hot. 

Gold. 

Alive.

He drank.

Gulped. 

Groaned. 

Trembled.

His body glowed. 

His curse cracked.

The shadows in his blood screamed as they were burned away.

He sucked until Kai was empty.

Until nothing remained but the shine of light in his chest.

He pulled off slowly. 

Kissed the softening head once.

It hit him without warning.

The moment Kai’s taste touched, and settled on his tongue, that salt‑gold spark, that living vow, something inside Aspen snapped its chains.

Heat punched through his spine.

Not lust.

Not pleasure.

Something older.

A release that wasn’t release at all, but an eviction.

His body seized, bowed, shuddered, and then he erupted.

His cock pulsing like shock waves from a dieing star.

It tore out of him like a dam finally allowed to fail, a flood that had been held back since the first curse whispered his name.

He came like a man being emptied, poured out,
purged.

A groan ripped out of him, raw, almost wounded, as if the darkness that had ruled him
was being forced out through every shaking inch of him,
spilling from him in hot, relentless waves.

It didn’t stop.

Wouldn’t stop.



¤¤¤¤¤


WHILE THE THRESHOLD WAS STILL OPEN 


¤¤¤¤¤



His whole body convulsed again, muscles locking, hips jerking,
as if lifetimes of hunger
were being expelled in one long, blinding surge.

He felt himself unraveling, not falling apart, being cleared out.

Being made ready.

It kept coming, another pulse, another violent bright shudder,
holy and humiliating all at once.

Tears burned his eyes.

It felt like a hand inside his soul
was wringing out the poison,
draining the curse, emptying the vessel of everything he had been
so there would be room for what was coming.

Room for what was blessed.

By the time the final tremor left him, Aspen was shaking from head to toe, sweat shining down his spine, breath shredded,
knees weak.

He knew, without needing words for it, that this wasn’t release.

This was rebirth.

The old hunger had been forced out of him in one long, shuddering, unstoppable offering…

…so the new power could take its throne.

Then collapsed.

Something broke open inside him.

Not shattered, unlocked.

Aspen gasped, his lips still wet with Kai’s light, his chest heaving like he’d surfaced from drowning in stars.

The seed didn’t just nourish, it rewrote.

It wasn’t submission.

It was recognition.

Power surged through him, not borrowed, not stolen, but bestowed.

The shadows in his blood recoiled, thrashed once, then bowed.

His spine arched, not in pain, but in arrival.

As if something buried in the marrow of his being had finally found its signal.

Something ancestral.

Predatory.

Royal.

Not dominance.

Dominion.

His breath came in low, reverent pulls.

Every nerve sang.

Every cell aligned.

He blinked, and the world snapped into a clarity he had never known, like fog burned off by divine fire.

This was not about serving Kai.

Not anymore.

This was about stepping into the throne that had waited for him, empty, hidden in the shadow of desire.

He felt it now:

The throne was inside him.

Carved from longing.

Crowned with fire.

Anchored by the one truth he could no longer run from.

Aspen wasn't becoming something else.

He was becoming himself.

The myth behind his curse.

The king inside the hunger.

And as the last of Kai’s light settled into his gut like a sun choosing its home, Aspen didn’t flinch.

He rose.

Not in defiance.

But in ascendancy.

A voice moved through the room.

Not sound. 
Not words.

But truth.

""We granted your request,"" it said.

""His seed you may carry. 

His life you may serve. 

But his heart? 

Never.""

Aspen sobbed harder.

Kai stirred. 

Just slightly. 

Whispered a breath.

And then, silence.

Aspen staggered back, breath raw, lips still shining with divinity.

The light that had filled the room began to dim, no, not dim, soften. 

The light held Kai as if it knew how to carry gods, not with urgency, but reverence.

It moved like, breath being held in a cathedral.

Slowly, it cradled Kai’s glowing body and began to lower him, gentle as moonlight over holy water.

Kai’s body descended through the charged stillness like a relic lowered into velvet, every inch a ceremony, every breath a rite.

His back touched the sheets like a chalice being placed back in velvet, precise, honored, untouched by haste.

His legs, long and muscled, floated slightly apart,
not spread in weakness, but opened like pillars accepting their temple's crown.

Thighs carved with the memory of motion, calves tight with ancestral instruction.

He was built like something meant to move oceans…

and had.

His torso glowed faintly,
not a shine, but a density, like the collapsed light of a dying star refusing to dim.

Abs tight, sharply defined, as if discipline had been braided into his flesh.

His skin was dusk-kissed gold, flushed with heat and ritual ache.

And at the center of it all, resting proud and heavy across his lower belly, was the proof of his lineage, not just arousal, but design.

There was nothing accidental about the shape of him.

He was the perfect accord between forces,

Blade and Pillar.

Length like a tempered sword, precision-forged.

Girth like the base of an altar, thick with gravity.

A weapon. 

A chalice. 

A riddle.

The head flushed, haloed with light.

Veins faintly aglow, like ley lines drawn through flesh.

Not obscene.

Never that.

Just truth, embodied.

His cock was not made to conquer.

It was made to catalyze.

To awaken.

To remember.

It curved slightly upward with divine arrogance, the kind of presence that asked for no permission and needed none.

His face, still soft in the hush of surrender, held the masculinity of mountains, jawline etched like prophecy, lashes long, lips parted in that final unspoken

 “yes.”

The room didn't dare exhale.

He wasn’t just beautiful.

He was balance incarnate.

The sacred edge between offering and power, between thunder and restraint.

This was Kai, not as teenager, not as lover, but as myth.

Laid bare.

Laid down.

Crowned in heat and devotion.

A living bridge between the Archive and the ache of every body that would ever long for something holy.

Kai had held back. 

Aspen was the one transformed.

What Kai received was something that might have crossed his mind once, when Aspen’s stare lingered too long, and Kai had read it clearly, and said yes. 

The Archive made it so, because Kai was not like the rest, reserved for the very few. 

Aspen would live on that knowledge alone.

He watched, heart thundering, the air still thick with the scent of sweat, salt, and sanctity.

Then he turned, still trembling, and stepped barefoot into the hallway, light closing softly behind him like a benediction.

Aspen curled into himself.

Tears dried on his cheeks.

His body hummed with rebirth.

But his heart cracked.

Because even in his salvation, he knew what he’d never touch.

Could never touch.




¤¤¤¤¤


Taste, Memory, Love 


¤¤¤¤¤


The morning was cruel in how ordinary it looked.

Sunlight through curtains.

Birdsong. 

The distant hum of a snowblower.

But Aspen woke up different.

He sat on the couch where he’d fallen, blinking into the pale light, his chest bare, his breath calm.

For the first time in weeks, maybe months, he didn’t feel hunted by his own hunger.

He felt… powerful.

Not frantic. 
Not starving. 

Not cracked at the edges.

Just alive.

The incubus curse still lived inside him, but now it bowed to him.

He stretched slowly, fingers flexing like they belonged to a new animal.

He looked down at his body. 

The glow was gone. 

But the memory wasn’t.

Kai’s cock. 

The warmth. 

The flood.

His mind flashed with it. 

The scent. 

The way the moan curled out of Kai’s chest like a spell.

He swallowed and exhaled hard.

""God,"" he whispered. 

“I didn’t think I could love him more.”

Then he laughed, short, breathless.

""And I don’t even like guys.”

""Just him.""

He rubbed his face. 

Sat forward.

No one stirred yet. 

Kai’s room was quiet.

 Still.

Aspen closed his eyes a moment longer.

He wouldn’t forget. 

Ever.

Not because of the act.

Because of the gift.

Because Kai, without knowing, without asking, had saved his life.

And even if he never had his heart, he’d carry that offering like a star in his gut for the rest of his life.

Somewhere deep in the silence, Aspen swore he heard it again:

“His seed you may carry. 
His life you may serve. 

But his heart?""

This time.

He nodded to the emptiness.

Not bitter. 
Not broken. 

Just changed.

Because loving Kai wasn’t the curse.

It was the price of being saved.



¤¤¤¤¤

Unspoken tribute 


¤¤¤¤¤


Kai woke slowly.

Not from sleep.

From return.

From the long drift back into his body after a night that had pulled something ancient through his veins.

His eyes opened to the familiar ceiling, the one he’d stared at a thousand times, yet it felt like the first time he'd ever really seen it.

The morning light touched him gently, as if it knew better than to approach too boldly.

His limbs were heavy.

His breath deep.

His pulse slow and deliberate.

He felt…emptied and refilled.

Burned and blessed.

Human and not.

A hum lived under his ribs,
the soft afterglow of a ritual completed, a chord that still vibrated long after the note had ended.

He didn’t know why his throat felt dry, why his cock ached faintly, why his chest thrummed with something like release
or surrender

or both.

He only knew the night had done something.

To him,

Through him.

Beyond him.

He sat up.

Static danced across his skin
like a lover trailing their fingers up his arms.

The sheets were a subtle mess,
creased, warm, touched by more than sleep.

He didn’t remember undressing.

Didn’t remember lying down.

But he felt… tended to.

Cared for.

Held.

Like the night itself had touched him and then stepped back into shadow.

The hallway outside creaked,
a careful step, a breath held too long.

Aspen.

Kai didn’t need to see him to know.

His presence stirred the air
with that strange cocktail of swagger, spark, and something darker curled under the ribs.

Something newly quiet.

Kai exhaled, stood, pulled on sweats.

Opened his door.

Aspen froze mid-step.

Shirtless.

Hair mussed.

Eyes still touched with echo
of something he couldn’t name.

Their gazes caught,
soft, brief, magnetic.

Not desire.

Not awkwardness.

Recognition.

Two boys standing in the aftershock of something holy
with no earthly language for it.


¤¤¤¤¤


The God Of Desire Reborn


¤¤¤¤¤



Aspen knelt, trembling.

Not from weakness.

From wonder.

From what he had discovered.

From the raw, dizzying magnitude of what he beheld.

Now, finally, he knew what Kai was, or rather, what he wasn’t.

Not just blood and breath.

Not just teenager or myth.

But something older.

Stranger.

Woven from stars no telescope could name.

And yet,

Aspen still didn’t know who Kai was.

What force had shaped him.

What dream or disaster had summoned him into this skin.

He didn’t care.
He couldn’t.

Because whatever Kai was…

Aspen loved him.

Not gently.
Not safely.

But with the wild, feral certainty of something born to protect.

He would kneel.
He would rise.

He would burn kingdoms to ash for this youth,

this god,

this question in human skin.

Anyone who tried to hurt him wouldn’t make it to a second breath.

Because Aspen wasn’t just awestruck anymore.

He was claimed.

And he would ruin the world to keep Kai safe.

Kai stood there.

Still.

Barefoot.

Joggers clinging low to his hips, fabric damp with sweat and sleep and something older.

His bulge hung heavy, proud, the weight of it impossible to ignore, not obscene, but inevitable.

Like gravity.

Like stormlight.

Like myth.

The shape of him was poetry etched in flesh.

Thighs carved, thick with power.

Abs etched in slow, divine geometry, a sacred rigging across golden skin that shimmered faintly, as if lit from within.

His chest rose and fell with effortless command, as if the air itself asked permission to enter him.

But it was the way he stood, unmoved, unbothered, yet utterly awake, that made the world pause.

This was not a teenager.

This was a god caught mid-transformation.

A being forged of legacy and lawless desire, veined with divinity, standing in cotton and calm like the moment before thunder strikes.

And beneath that cotton?

The outline of him strained boldly against the fabric.

Thick.

Long.

Alive.

A weapon shaped for worship.

The kind of cock stories forgot how to tell because it was never meant to be described, only experienced.

His body didn’t boast.

It testified.

Aspen couldn’t stop going over it in his mind’s eye, the moment unfolding again and again, each pass leaving him more undone.

And everything in the room, even the shadows, leaned toward him.

Kai didn’t pose.

He didn’t need to.

He was already the altar.

And the offering.

And the fire.

“You good?”

Aspen swallowed.

Hard.

“Yeah,” he said.

Then softer.

“Better than I’ve been in a long time.”

He tried to grin, and almost managed it.

Almost hid the tremble
that wasn’t fear but reverence.

Kai nodded slowly.

Something inside him warmed at Aspen’s voice, at the honesty in it, at the gratitude he didn’t speak.

Good.

He didn’t know why he felt protective.

Why Aspen looked different to him.

Why the air between them felt threaded with something
that hadn’t been there yesterday.

But he didn’t question it.

Kai had learned long ago:

when the world rearranges itself,
you just breathe and let it finish.

In the kitchen, the house behaved strangely.

The kettle turned on by itself.

The lights flickered once, in greeting, not warning.

The shadows in the corners looked softer, as if bowed.

Aspen followed Kai into the kitchen and leaned against the counter, arms crossed, a heat in his body he couldn’t shake but no longer feared.

Kai poured coffee.

Two mugs.

Instinct.

He slid one toward Aspen.

Their fingers didn’t touch, but the air did.

A quiet spark.

A hint of last night.

A whisper of something ancient
still settling.

Aspen looked at him like he was seeing him for the first time.

Like something had been fulfilled.

And something else had begun.

Kai felt the weight of that stare.

Didn’t shy from it.

Held it.

Just long enough.

Then,

“Want breakfast?”

Kai asked.

Aspen’s grin returned,
real this time.

“Hell yes.”

And the house,
the old, patient house,
seemed to sigh in relief.

As if the night had passed.

As if the morning had begun.

As if the world, for now,
was allowed to be gentle.

Somewhere, far from clocks and fireworks, the new year had already ended.

Not in noise.

Not in countdowns.

But in the soft rearranging of breath and bone.

In the hush that follows choosing.

In the hum that follows becoming.

Aspen felt it settle in his chest,
not like a decision, but a marking.

The teenager who had arrived at the party hours ago would not be the one who left.

Nor would any of them.

Not Sequoia with her coiled grace.

Not Mike with his stillness like prophecy.

Not even Kai, glowing faintly in sleep, body carved in devotion and myth.

This year would stretch differently.

This would be the summer everything unfolded.

For Kai?

It would be the summer he would meet his match, the one the old myths whispered about in half-sentences and thunderstorms, the one meant to hold time and thunder with him,
not behind, not below, but beside.

They hadn’t crossed paths yet.

But time had already turned its face toward them.

And the summer would not come gently.

The air already knew.

So did the Archive.

A new line had begun.

And none of them would ever be the same.


¤¤¤¤¤


""Echoes That Don’t Leave Clean""


¤¤¤¤¤



 
(New Year’s Day - Aspen, After Kai)


Aspen didn’t remember the Uber home.

Only the silence.

Only the way the night had pressed its weight into his throat like a vow he hadn’t meant to make.

By the time he stepped into his mansion, the walls greeted him like a cathedral returning its prodigal son.

He didn’t go to bed.

He went straight to the bathroom.

The steam rose without instruction.

And in the mirror, the teenager who had tasted god stood still
and waited to become someone new.

The walls were warm marble, veined like ancient rivers.

The floors radiant with heat.

The ceiling high, recessed lights dimmed to mimic dawn.

A rain-shower still dripped behind him.

The steam hung like breath caught in prayer.

He stood there, bare chest, towel low, skin still humming.

Sunlight poured through the glass wall that overlooked the private garden, slanting across his collarbones like scripture.

But Aspen didn’t move.

He stared at himself.

Not in vanity.
Not in shame.

In wonder.

Like he was still trying to understand who had walked into that room with Kai last night…

and what had walked out.

His body looked the same.

Sharp.

Golden.

Built like temptation wrapped in privilege.

But something had shifted.

Not outside.

Within.

He touched his lips.

A memory flickered.

Heat.

Salt.

The weight of something holy across his tongue.

His breath trembled, not from arousal, from the echo of something larger than lust.

Something sacred.

He had been changed.

Not corrupted.

Not converted.

Transformed.

By what he had tasted.

By what he now carried.

By who Kai truly was.

It hadn’t been desire.

Not exactly.

It had been pull.

It had been summons.

It had been a rite wearing the face of a teenager.

And now…

He stood in the hush of his marble palace, still not knowing how to carry what had entered him into a world built to forget things like this.

He gripped the sink edge,
not tight, just enough to not float off.

Because that’s what it felt like.

Like something inside him had become buoyant.

Like a sun had lodged behind his ribs and no longer needed permission to shine.

And yet, there was SHAME.

Not for the act.

But for how deeply he had needed it.

The awe.

The hunger.

The surrender.

What would it feel like to have it again?

He tried to cast the thought aside.

But it didn’t leave clean.

In the vast hush of his house, silence reigned.

Aspen thought.

You grow up thinking life is about being good.

About sharing.

About charity as virtue.

And with age, you learn that this is true, but incomplete.

Because generosity is not a moral suggestion.

It is a universal law.

What you place into the world is what the world is able to return to you. 

There is a spiritual economy at work, precise and indifferent, keeping account whether you believe in it or not. 

Some lives fracture not from curses or malice or the so-called evil eye, but from empty accounts, years of withholding, of fearing loss, of never risking the full measure of the heart.

There is no affliction in that.

Only imbalance.

The ambrosia made this visible to Aspen.

Standing before the mirror, breath still uneven, he saw it all at once, not judgment, but clarity. 

His eyes burned, wet with tears he hadn’t earned until now, because Kai had done something far more dangerous than saving him.

Kai had set his spirit free.

And in doing so, had caged his heart.

That was the price.

That was the gift.

And Aspen understood, finally, that freedom without possession can still be the deepest form of devotion.

But inside Aspen?

Something had begun to roar.

Downstairs, staff would be preparing the brunch tray.

The world would think it was just a lazy New Year’s Day.

But here…

Here, in this sacred quiet, Aspen knew:

Everything had changed.

Not just for him.

For all of them.

This wasn’t just a new year.

It was a threshold.

It had arrived not like a ceremony,
but like a giant had left his door open and a strange new wind had blown in.

A shift was coming.

A storm they hadn’t named yet.

A lover.

A rival.

A test.

Kai would soon meet his match,
the one fated to carry time and thunder beside him.

But Aspen...

Aspen had his own vow now.

He didn’t just serve Kai.

He would shield him.

Build what was needed.

Become what the Archive had whispered into his spine.

They had granted his request.

But not gently.

Not without condition.

And in that holy, golden bathroom, with steam in the air and the taste of myth still on his lips, Aspen heard the echo again, not in sound, but in knowing:

“His seed you may carry.

His life you may serve.

But his heart?

Never.”

He didn’t cry.

Not this time.

He simply nodded to his reflection, the new one.

The one he hadn’t known until  last night.

Because loving Kai wasn’t the curse.

It was the price of being chosen.

I’m just curious…if the general amount needed for adults is 6-18mg, and 27mg for pregnant women…how am I still deficient?? Where does it go? Or is it just not being absorbed?

[Synopsis from Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37353746/): 

At a 24-hour bookstore in Shenzhen, Lu Da, frustrated in his job search, rekindles his fighting spirit amid the aroma of coffee and books deep into the night, eventually knocking on the door of opportunity. In the commercial buildings of Huaqiangbei, former opera star Sister Fan sheds her costume to become the “Deal-making Queen,” carving out a new world in the arena of electronic products.

Delivery rider Tan Xiaohe, known as the “Queen of Orders,” embodies professional dignity through her work. Drone engineer Zhang Yi and Nuannuan weave a love story through lines of code. A forest encounter between the lost youth Xiaopeng and a stray civet cat inspires the creation of the country’s first wildlife overpass.

1pqa7j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RoomtasticRentastic/comments/1pqa7j4/1400_sunny_12x15_room_on_ocean_parkway_comes_with/,"1400 Sunny 12x15 Room on Ocean Parkway, comes with a prefab family","This one won’t be for everyone: Do you want to have \_a\_ family around, just not \_your\_ family?  
  
Our two-parent, two-teenager household lives between two apartments in the same building. One of them is not full-time occupied—there's a little washer and dryer, a guest room we use, and your room. You could think of your (sunny, prewar) room as like a finished basement or a garage? It’s part of a family home, but it's often empty.   
  
Foot traffic:   
We’re in and out 24/7 for laundry and storage and zoom meetings and sleepovers, but then it’ll go quiet for a few days. Sometimes one of us camps out for a weekend. Sometimes kids hang out watching videos (with headphones). Sometimes our literal guests stay in the guest room. But you would be the main person there every night, and the main person with shampoo in the shower. None of us live there full time, though eventually one or two of us may.   
  
Your room:   
Your room is 12 by 15 feet, 180sf, though some of it is taken up by a six-foot wide, 30-inch deep closet that goes up to the 9-foot ceiling. That leaves 165 sf of open floor. There are two sunny west/southwest facing windows. They look out on multi-lane traffic, plus a lot of trees and sky. Unfurnished. The wood floors are beautiful, but a building noise-reduction rule requires rugs over 80% of them.   
  
Shared spaces:   
The living room, kitchen, and bath are shared. There isn’t a tv in the living room, or shelving, or decor, and for us that’s ideal. Keeping it minimal for now. We'll be in and out of the bathroom and kitchen. We store some things in the kitchen, but it’s not our million-meals-a-day cooking environment.   
  
Utilities:   
The room has a new window a/c. In heat season, with radiators, you’re more likely to be too warm than too cold. Half of gas, electric, and wifi has been about 75/month, probably higher in a/c season.  
  
Building:   
The building is a family-oriented walkup coop, fairly diverse, and lgbt friendly. Four(?) of the 40 apartments are supportive housing for developmentally disabled adults. There are multiple outdoor spaces, including front yard and courtyard, plus a long, skinny back courtyard (or is it an alley?) where people do some vegetable gardening. Take a raised bed in the spring, there is no waitlist. The front yard is basically decorative, but the courtyard is comfortable. It’s shown in aerial view in the photos. There’s a commercial laundry room in the basement. And just to repeat the word walkup again, it’s a walkup. Building quiet hours are 10pm to 9am, and we have to take them seriously because the super lives directly below this space.  
  
Neighborhood:   
You can walk around the block and hit laundromats, delis, coffee, and takeout without crossing the street. More coffee, some bars, and a bookstore within a few blocks. Bigger grocery stores and more serious restaurants 5-10 minutes walk. Ten minutes to Greenwood Cemetery or Prospect Park.  
  
Transit:   
We are 0.3 miles to either the Fort Hamilton F/G (the directions say 8-minute walk ) or Church Ave F/G (9 minutes). The B and D are farther, 0.7 miles (16 minutes), but the bus often gets you to them quickly. There are two Citibike racks within a block.  
  
About us:   
Nerds for sure. Our current employers include: a bookstore, a publisher, a parenting group. The kids are pretty mild for teenagers. So far. Our main need is to feel comfortable running into you, and to sense that you're comfortable running into us.   
  
About you:   
We enjoy students and artists, and we plan to enjoy meeting you, whoever you are. We'll have to collaborate on cleaning and maintenance—are you ok to collaborate on cleaning and maintenance? And you'd have to live with unpredictably in-and-out housemates. Also with kids. You’d want to be better than ok with kids. You'd want to feel comfortable being part of a household ecosystem, even just as a satellite.    
  
Long-range stayability:   
If you were happy and comfortable, and you wanted to stay, it might be possible to get past the building’s two-year sublet limit. If one of us eventually slept full-time in the guest room, then the limited-term ""sublet"" could become a longer-term ""roommate” situation.   
  
Possibles and impossibles:   
Couples, impossible. Loudness or hosting hookups or parties, also impossible. Basement bike storage, possible. Storage in closets outside your room, impossible. Small, lovely neutered dogs maybe possible? Cats, impossible (allergies).    
  
How-to:   
Because we’re a family and because it’s a coop building, this takes more oomph than an average shared rental. Steps:   
1. Phone call? If you wish.    
2. Come see.   
3. If it's any kind of match, come meet the kids.   
4. If that works, we'll send you the application form.   
5. Enter the paperwork tunnel: Do you have two school or work-related recommendation letters? Great, PDF them. If not, have a boss and/or family friend write some. Filed taxes? Great, attach the top page. Ditto bank statements. Ditto pay stubs.   
6. Send it all back and the board will approve it. (We're on the board.)   
7. Sign a lease. ",1,1766113301.0,u_RoomtasticRentastic,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to hopefully make a connection that leads to some romance! Posting on Reddit again (dating apps are still killing me sos) as I’ve met some great folks on here and I’m still hoping to find someone who matches my energy! 😂

A lil about me, I am a cis lady, from Canada. I am pretty femme, and I’d say I have a very cute, comfortable/casual style. I do want to get a few more tattoos in the future as well! I am about 5’5ish, average size ish (A lil chubby, but not plus size.), dark brunette and have brown eyes. In terms of like actual hobbies I do spend most of my free time doing fibre crafts. I do love napping when I can, I do smoke sometimes, I also enjoy doing my makeup and tweaking my skincare routine, and self care (does this count as a hobby lol?) I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game sometimes on my switch. I also love pets, if you have one send pics PLZ. I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too. 😊

Im not really dead set on someone particular or a “type” I’m looking for (slight preference for mascs but? Not a huge deal lol), I’m very chatty and am hoping you are too though! I’d love to hear about your day everyday, your hobbies, yours passions and everything else going on! Also please have a good sense of humour! I would prefer if you were close ish to my age or a bit older (25+), and preferably from Canada or North America? I can’t do huge time zone differences, I sleep too much! 😂 I am also monogamous relationship wise, very on the fence about kids, and want to be around people who share the same values (Politically left and an atheist.) Also happy to swap selfies if you wanna see who you’re talking to! 

Please if you do reach out, please tell me your age, where you’re from and a little blurb about you so we can get to chitty chatting! I’d love to hear about your plans for the holidays, and see if you were naughty or nice this year! 😂",1,1766113258.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False

My stable stuttered and I think —

Now happily the devil walks on the ceiling.

You say he's happier on the ceiling but I—

The window lets in a black universe

And as we drink our coffee, 

Your blonde hair vies meekly for my attention 

It speaks of submission and posture.

I hold your hand, the cups start dancing 

The whole kitchen erupts in a riot of light— 

I think I don't want to let it go.

1pqa34w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1pqa34w/people_we_love/,People we love,"Some people asked me once why I don't just reach out if I still care. And I didn't know how to explain it. How do you tell someone that love and wanting someone in your life are completely separate things? That you can hold affection for someone and also know, with absolute certainty, that reconnecting would ruin it? 

Because I know what would happen. We'd meet for coffee. It would be awkward. We'd try to catch up but realize we don't actually have the foundation for it anymore. We'd be forcing conversation like strangers at a networking event. And then we'd leave and never do it again, but now the memory would be tainted with that disappointment. 

Better to keep them preserved exactly as they are. In the past. In theory. It's the perfect relationship, in a way. All the warmth, none of the work. 

Sometimes I wonder if I exist like this for other people. If there's someone out there who thinks of me fondly every few months but would panic if I actually texted them. If I'm someone's theoretical person. Someone they love in a way that requires my absence. 

That should feel sad, but it doesn't. It feels kind of beautiful, actually. To matter to someone without mattering to their daily life. To be held gently in memory without the pressure of presence. 

I used to think this was avoidant. Some kind of emotional cowardice. That if I really loved these people, I'd do the work to keep them. That letting them drift into theory was the same as not caring. 

But I don't think that's true anymore. I think it takes a different kind of love to let someone stay in the past. To resist the urge to drag them into your present just because you miss the idea of them. To let them be perfect and frozen instead of real and disappointing.

1pqa0p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hercuddle_Hub/comments/1pqa0p2/when_confidence_gets_rewritten_as_a_problem/,When Confidence Gets Rewritten as a Problem,"Tate McRae mentioned in a Rolling Stone :  
“People always want girls to put themselves out there. And the second they do, they get ripped apart for it.”

  
When I read that, my first reaction was not resonance but a physical sense of familiarity.  
I had sent my boyfriend a few photos of casual outfits I was considering buying last week, along with one dress I might wear to a New Year’s party. He replied, “You’re very beautiful, but I think most of the time you dress too revealing, too sexy. You’d be just as beautiful if you wore more clothes.”  
What?

  
At the time, I didn’t react strongly, but I couldn’t help wondering whether this was a warning sign of controlling behavior.  
I bought the New Year’s dress anyway and plan to wear it tonight. He doesn’t drink and doesn’t attend large parties, so he won’t be there.  
About 60 percent of the time, I wear leggings and a sports bra for running, lifting, yoga, walking the dog, or errands, with a sweater if needed. The rest of the time, for coffee or daytime wandering, I dress more like this or this.  
I might show a bit of skin, like my midriff, but I don’t believe my clothing is more revealing than other women’s, or that there is anything performative or attention seeking about it.  
The most ironic part is that his words were almost never malicious. They sounded like advice, like experience, like something said “for my own good.”  
But every sentence subtly reframed something that belonged to me into a problem that needed to be managed.  
Later, I realized that the discomfort I felt was not me being overly sensitive.

  
Just as Tate said, when women first feel sexual and confident, the world rarely asks how that feels. Instead, it immediately starts asking whether it is appropriate.

  
What broke me in that moment was not being judged, but realizing that all the effort, thought, and self affirmation I had put into myself were reduced, in someone else’s narrative, to a single question: was she trying to be looked at?",1,1766112757.0,Hercuddle_Hub,0,1.0,False

For those who dont know its a learning disability and the only reason I can spell it is cause of my phone. Basically it means numbers and words go in one side but fall out the other.

When I’m not scheming the next big twist for my D&D party, I’m working as a nurse in a locked Alzheimer’s unit. I'm basically the guy keeping your grandparents safe, loved, and hydrated while getting paid in emotional damage and coffee.

When I’m off the clock, I’m usually covered in dog hair courtesy of my two “daughters”: a German Shepherd puppy with no concept of personal space and an Australian Shepherd sass queen who runs the house. I also have an ongoing Warhammer addiction and can often be found hunched over a paintbrush pretending I have steady hands.

Too flirty for my own good, nerd-approved, and powered by caffeine. I sometimes make erotic audio if you're into that kind of thing.

1pq9vrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pq9vrz/peopco/,PEOPCO,"First time poster here. I don't have much time, I need to get this out there. I don't know where to start, I'm scared to keep all this inside, but I'm terrified to relive it. Please, bare with me. I will not be sharing my real name, and don't even bother trying to email me, it's a disposable email. As soon as this is posted I will cease to exist again.



I've been running for months now, trying to stay one step ahead. It's true what they said. It was all fucking true. I see flashes of it in my mind. Short sentences that didn't make one ounce of sense at first. I see it when I try to sleep.... ""SEE SOON"", and ""WE COME YOU DONT CHOOSE"". FUCK! I'm going crazy just thinking about it! Ok, I'm going to calm myself down, and I am going to tell you my story, from the start, in every detail I can remember. Here goes………



It was just coming into Winter when this all began. I remember because the night it began I was enjoying a nice warm caramel latte. It started off seemingly harmless. I should probably mention, I am male. That is the only personal information I will be sharing. I'm not exactly popular, so I was intrigued when the facebook friend requests started coming through. I didn't know what to think of these people. They all had strange, weird names about different animals and things like that. I don't really remember the specifics, too much has happened since then. I do remember one about a chicken, I think?



Anyway. So here's where the foundation of this story comes into play. Scrolling down the list of requests I see one that stands out. I was instantly creeped out when I saw it. The picture itself was ridiculous, a disgusting looking 40 something year old, stretching his mouth with his hands to totally unnatural proportions. His head was bald, his face was pale and his eyes..... there was something about those eyes..... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. His name? Possibly the weirdest factor here, his name was Jack Smile. Strange huh? But that wasn't what creeped me out. There was something about looking at this guy that gave me a bad vibe. Sitting there, I was overcome with this feeling that SOMETHING was wrong. I shook it off, probably my mind running in overdrive I thought. I didn't accept the request, but I didn't think anything more of it either. I closed my laptop and decided to play some playstation before bed.



Waking up the next morning, I looked at the clock and realized I had overslept BIG TIME. I struggled to get out of bed. I felt like shit, like I had just popped a bunch of valium. I could not keep my eyes open. Deciding I had already wasted enough of the day I forced myself to stand up and go and get some much needed caffeine. On the way out of my room I opened up my laptop ready to jump on and check some emails, catch up on social media, you know the daily norms. But as the laptop screen powered on and revealed the facebook website, I noticed an unusual amount of notifications. As I said I'm not the most popular guy so this was totally out of the ordinary for me. Feeling pretty chuffed with my seemingly newfound popularity, I went and got myself a coffee and came back.

I sat down and hastily clicked the notifications icon. My stomach.... LITERALLY ...... DROPPED. 



Well, not literally, but I understand the saying now. It felt as though my stomach was falling, over and over again. There in front of me were hundreds of notifications, letting me know my posts and photos had been PUBLICLY SHARED. One by one I scrolled down, seeing endless notifications reading ""Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your status, Jack Smile shared your..."" and on and on and on! Feeling beyond creeped at this point, I navigated to this guy's profile. There in front of me were ALL of my posts and photos, dating right back to when I first joined Facebook. Why? I kept asking myself ""why?"". Why was he fucking doing this? Is it someone I know playing a stupid prank? Not wanting anything further to do with this individual, EVER, I swiftly hit the 'block' button.



At this point I think it's important to point out that I am a privacy freak. My Facebook profile is hidden. My I.P is hidden. Everything is locked down. I'm a hermit, not even my best friends know where I live. Important information to keep in mind for the purposes of this story. So anyway, I had him blocked, and I set an alert via a browser extension to sound a bell whenever the words ""Jack Smile"" were identified. Thinking this was the end of it, I carried on checking my emails, and got on with my day.



About a week went by, perhaps longer, I'm a little hazy. Everything was normal. No friend requests, no weird random post shares. I had just about forgotten the whole thing. It was Saturday afternoon, and I was caught up on all of my assessments (I was studying online at this point). It was a nice day outside, and I hate nice days and outside, so I decided to jump on the PS4 and play some battlefield. Partied up with my buddy (we'll call him Simon), and started searching for a match.



We ended up playing for hours, it was the most fun I'd had in a long time. I was just about to tell Simon that I was heading off to grab some dinner when his voice became shaken, then fell silent. I was worried, I shouted for him to answer me for about 2 minutes before I got a response. Still audibly shaken, Simon just managed to get his words out ""D..d.dd....dude..... Someone just messaged me on ..... on PSN...... he knows your fucking name dude....."". I knew instantly. I knew what was happening, my heart began to race and that feeling in my stomach returned and hit me like a tonne of bricks.



I didn't want to know, but I had to ask; ""Who..... who is it man?"". Simon responded with those two words I dreaded to hear, ""Jack.... Smile..... it's someone named Jack Smile"". I felt like crying. Who the fuck was this guy and why was he so hell bent on contacting me?? I had to know, I just had to know... ""Simon..... what the fuck did he say?"". Simon, still shaken, read the message out to me, it read...

""PEOPCO KARL THOMPSON!! DONT BLOCK JACK!!! HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME!!”.



I was in disbelief. A state of utter confusion and panic. Who is this guy? Realizing I had been silent for about 5 minutes straight processing all this, I snapped back to reality remembering Simon was still on party chat, ""are you all good bro?"" I asked him. Simon responded ""Dude.... how the fuck did he know that I knew you?"". I hadn't even considered this until now. Not only does this guy know my name, but he knew I was on PSN, and he KNEW who I was gaming with at that very moment. Looking back now there is absolutely no doubting that he was watching somehow. It's what they fucking do. They watch, they sit and watch as your sanity fritters away.



Anyway, back to the story. I apologize, my mind is all over the place. I said my goodbyes to Simon, and told him that it's probably best that we only speak over the phone from here on out. He agreed, and told me that he would call me tomorrow to check up. I thanked him for that, he was a good friend. I powered off my console and decided to check on facebook before bed, I was seriously contemplating deactivating my profile at this point. I went to the fridge and grabbed myself a cold bud. I fucking needed it. I chugged it back, every last drop before grabbing another one and heading back to my laptop. I opened it up, and would you believe it? Another friend request and a buttload of notifications. I clicked the friend request, hesitantly.



When I saw who it was, I slammed the laptop shut so hard I'm amazed it survived. There was a friend request from Jack. Spelled ""J@ck Smyle"". He knew. He fucking knew! He knew that I had set an alert on my browser, remember I mentioned that?? He MUST have known! Why else would he spell his name that way?! There was no other explanation. This was creepy before, but as far as I was concerned it had just become dangerous. There was no doubt in my mind anymore, whether online or closer than I thought, I was being stalked.



I didn't get one ounce of sleep that night. The sun came up and stung me un-forgivingly through my bedroom window. I felt like trash. My phone had gone flat, so I put it on to charge before heading out into the kitchen to grab a shitty microwave breakfast. I threw it in the microwave, and threw it in the bin as soon as it was done. It smelled worse than I felt. But I digress, returning to my bedroom I checked my now slightly charged phone, 4 missed calls. Fuck. Could it be? I stared at them, they were all from a blocked number. I couldn't even trace it. I jumped as the phone began ringing again.



Blocked number, again. I answered it and sat on the line silently. A voice came through, ""Karl!"". I was shitting bricks. No holding back now, I responded ""I don't know who the fuck you are or what you want, but I will find out and I'll be handing your information to the cops. Back off"". I felt pretty good about that, and the line was quiet for a moment before the voice came over again ""Dude! It's Simon you idiot!"". Dammit, now I felt like a piece of shit, I had totally forgotten he was going to call me. I responded ""I'm so sorry man, I saw the blocked number and thought it must have been that fucking mouth dude"". Simon was understanding of this, ""It's all good bro, I was just callin' to check in, but I have to go now, I love you bro"". And he hung up.



That was weird. Everybody loves their best bro, but no one says it, especially Simon and I. Looking back, if I hadn't been so overtired my mind probably would have been better able to put it all together. Why Simon had called me from a blocked number when he never had before, why he was in such a rush to hang up the phone, and why after all this time he felt the need to tell me he loves me. It wasn't until I caught a glimpse of the patrol car pulling up outside my house, and answered my door to a police officer informing me that my best friend of the past 20 years had gone missing that I pieced it together.



I broke down, I can barely remember that moment. It's all a blur. I do remember one thing though, I just couldn't figure out why the police had come to me, if this is a missing persons case then why weren't they out there searching? And why me? I thought they only contacted direct family? I picked myself up off the ground, turned to the officer and put my questions to him. His response still tears me up inside to this day. He put his hand on my shoulder, looked me in the eyes and said, ""Because he mentioned you in his suicide note... I'm so sorry son”.



I don't remember much of the following month. I fell into a deep depression. My life was alcohol and sleep. I was barely eating, I would drink and pass out only to do it all again the next day. They never found Simon's body, and I was so drunk 24/7 I forgot about his funeral. I missed my best friend's fucking funeral. After about a month of this self abuse I was finally able to pick myself up and start getting back to normality. I contacted my course provider and apologized for my absence. I managed to sweet talk my way into beginning my studies again, under normal circumstances I would have been kicked out.



Things were looking positive. But isn't it always the case, just when you think everything will be ok, and the metaphorical sun is shining at its brightest, the dark clouds return. Yeah, you guys guessed it, I opened facebook and there they were, hundreds of notifications, ""Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile..."" and you get the idea. All of a sudden I wasn't scared, I wasn't anxious, I was just fucking angry!



No more, I'm going to talk to this asshole and find out what the fuck he wants. I clicked on his profile and initiated a private message session. I'm going to copy and paste the message session below, I'll tidy it up a little so it reads clearer, but I'm going to leave his responses in tact so that you can get an idea of what I was dealing with here, and what to look out for…



*Me: Ok. Own the fuck up asshole. Who are you and what do you want?*



*seen*



*2 hours later*



*Me: You have seen this message! answer!*



*Jack Smile: HELLO TO KARL THOMPSON HELLO*



*Me: Why the fuck are you doing this? Is this a joke?*



*Jack Smile: NOT JOKE BECAUSE PEOPCO NEED THE PEOPLE*



*Me: What are you talking about???*



*Jack Smile: THIS IS A VERY GOOD THAT YOU ARE TALK TO JACK IF YOU ARENT TALK JACK I HAVE NO WAY TO COME SEE*



*Me: See WHAT?!*



*Jack Smile: NO YOU DONT ASK THAT PEOPCO WE COME TO YOU YOU DONT GET TO CHOOSE*



*Me: Look man, drop it. This is a sick fucking joke and I'm goin to bring the cops into this if you don't get lost.*



*Jack Smile: THIS NOT GOOD WE PEOPCO NEED THE BEAUTIFUL HAPPY PEOPLE BUT NOT ANGRY NOT HOSTILE WE COME GET SOON*



*Me: Fucking explain yourself idiot. Are you saying you are coming to get me?*



*Jack Smile: YES IT IS THAT*



*Me: Ha! good luck finding me asshole.*



*seen*



This was when EVERYTHING turned upside down on me. This is when I realized I was outclassed. 2 minutes later, this asshole, I shit you not, drops a PICTURE OF MY FUCKING HOUSE IN THE CONVERSATION! He followed this up by saying ""PEOPCO SEE SOON"" before immediately deactivating his facebook account within seconds. I screamed when I saw this. I jumped out of my chair and ran around my house closing every window, drawing every curtain and locking every door.



My fight or flight reflex was in full effect and I was ready to kill ANYTHING that came near my house. I don't remember anything after this, I remember my breathing becoming incredibly rapid and short as I shot quick glances around my dark house in every direction, I remember becoming light headed, and I can only assume I then passed out.

  
I remember waking up on the floor the next day to a knock at the door. My head being in scatters I walked to the door and answered it. There was no one there. That's weird, oh well. I then remembered the previous night, it all came back to me in that one moment and I was instantly gripped in fear, my entire body ran ice cold. I slammed the door and locked it. I got straight on the phone to the police. I had to report this. I didn't ever want to find out what the fuck this PEOPCO shit was.



I called it in, and I had to go into the station to file the report. I hated having to leave the house. I was on edge the entire time. My anxiety was killing me. And you know what? After all that the fuckers wouldn't even help me. They said ""There's been no physical contact"" and as far as they could tell it's just some internet troll. I knew better. Feeling defeated, I began the walk home. I lived in a small town, so no big deal. The worst part was knowing that freak could be anywhere. I've never felt so exposed. Walking home, I felt naked, like there were eyes right on me the whole way. Then I noticed it, it was faint, barely audible. And it had been with me the whole time. I assumed it was bugs or.... I don't know.... something. But no, I was mistaken. I looked up above me and there was no mistaking it, there was a fucking drone! A very small one but it was undoubtedly a drone. As soon as I spotted it, it flew away.



I've never made it home so fast in my life. I collapsed on the floor and cried like a bitch for hours. I didn't know what else to do. I was scared to be in my home, I was scared to leave my home. I was scared to engage in the digital world. Even online I could feel those watching eyes on me. I disconnected my wifi, I unplugged my PS4, I shut down my laptop and I took the sim card out of my phone. I wondered to myself just how long he had been watching.



Emotionally and physically spent, I crawled into bed. I laid there for hours, my mind running in overdrive, trying to think of any reasonable explanation for all this. But there wasn't one. I was hearing strange noises. Laying there, I was convinced it was all in my head, that I was being driven to insanity, then suddenly a thought him me, and I physically felt my face turning pale white. The fucking laundry door! How could I be so stupid?! I forgot to lock it the previous night!! I jumped out of bed and ran to my bedroom door, stopping at the last minute. My mind froze as the reality of what was happening ceased my entire body in fear. Laughing. I heard laughing INSIDE THE HOUSE. It was.... ridiculous! It was like a childish, babyish laugh, but clearly coming from a grown man. I heard scratching, and laughing, the laughter became louder and louder and suddenly BAM! I heard a door slam shut.



I sat, pressed up against my now locked bedroom door until morning came. I picked up my collectors edition Yankees bat, and slowly walked outside. I crept down the hall, the slightest noises were causing my heart to stop. I turned and walked into the laundry. What I saw caused my legs to collapse underneath me. I fell onto my knees and stared, incapacitated by fear and disbelief, at three large words carved into the wooden wall... ""PEOPCO SEE SOON”.



He was in my house. He was IN MY FUCKING HOUSE. There was nothing left to do. I had no options left but to hole up in here and either wait this out or die. I called a taxi and got dropped off at the hardware store. I bought the biggest, toughest looking door locks, chains and padlocks I could find. On the way back home I told the cab driver to take me to a bar. I spent the next hour intoxicating myself, before buying a case of bud to go and catching another cab back home. I fortified the shit out of my home, cracked open my case of beer, rested my baseball bat in my lap and waited....... and waited.............. and waited.......... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I began to relax, I plugged the TV back in, opened another beer and kicked back. Perhaps this is just the moment he was waiting for, because it was then that I felt it, a sharp pain, something tiny and sharp being driven into the back of my neck. I was thrown into a small panic, then all of a sudden, before I could even figure out what was going on, I was completely calm. Then it all went black.



The next part of this story is incredibly difficult for me to tell, I apologize if my writing seems sloppy, I apologize if you struggle to understand it. I'm doing my best to stay focused here. In some strange way this is therapeutic, but it's not easy. So, here goes…



The next thing I can remember is waking up. It was hot, like really fucking hot. And I was thirsty. I sat up and began to take in my surroundings. I saw dry mountains, bushland, a wooden fence spanning miles it seemed. Then I remembered, the pain in my neck, someone sedated me. It's the only explanation. This was it, whoever had been following me, they had got to me. I tried to stand up but I couldn't, I was still too weak. I felt like crying, if you think you've felt genuine fear, you haven't. Trust me. I ripped at the chains that bound me for what felt like eternity, I pulled until I was bleeding and then I pulled some more. It wasn't until the sun began to fall that the hopelessness truly sank in. There was nothing I could do. I had no idea who these people were, what they wanted, and there was nothing I could do but wait. I didn't know what they were planning, but you don't chain a person to a tree if you have good intentions for them, I knew that much. The fear was killing me. I was totally awake an conscious at this stage and it was all beginning to sink in, I was probably going to die. It's a strange sensation let me tell you, the fear is brutal, but the certainty of looming death brings a strange sense of calm. So I did what most in my situation would, I laid down and waited. Just waited. What was the point in trying? It was over, I lost. I laid there for hours just going over this whole thing in my head, over and over again.



It was then I heard it. That fucking laughter. That childish laughter I heard in my house that night, but it was coming from a group. Yeah, there were a lot of them. People just like me I wondered? The laughter grew closer, and louder. I closed my eyes and waited. I wondered to myself how they were gonna do it, would they just shoot me? Would they stab me? I kept my eyes closed and waited for the inevitable. Then I heard his voice, I just knew it was him, ""GET UP FROM GROUND!"" he said. It was SO strange, if my situation was not so dire I would have laughed, he was screaming at me, and yet his voice was full of happy tones. I looked up. It was him indeed, it was Jack fucking Smile. Again he said ""GET ON FEET OFF GROUND!"" in that weird angry/happy hybrid voice of his. That in itself was unsettling. I tried to speak but I couldn't. I tried to tell him that I was too weak to stand but I could not talk, my mouth hurt, it hurt really fucking badly. Not surprising, I was sore all over.



He then walked quickly toward me doing that weird laughing thing, he grabbed my arm and pulled me up, he had a gigantic smile that stretched over his entire face, he laughed as he pulled me to my feet only for me to collapse again, and the process was repeated over and over. I managed to get out the words ""I cant stand I'm too weak!"". He stopped laughing, and his smile grew, somehow that giant unsettling smile grew larger. He held up his hand and shouted ""HERE YOU OTHER PEOPLE"" which I assumed means ""come here"". Two other men walked over to me. It was then that I noticed the large group standing around me.... and then I noticed their faces. I instantly threw up whatever was left in my stomach. It was disgusting. I looked again to confirm what I had seen and threw up again. Every person here was smiling. No, I don't mean they were happy, I mean they were smiling, permanently.



Their faces, all of them, were full of industrial grade staples, morphing their mouths into a gigantic smile similar to Jack's. I have never, and probably will never witness anything quite as disturbing as this. I glanced around the group. Some of them were visibly crying, sickeningly contrasting the unnatural smiles on their faces. Some of them were still bleeding around where the staples were pushed in. And some of them, perhaps most unsettling of them all, were visibly enjoying themselves. Then I saw him.... in the back, barely recognisable. I broke down into tears as I spotted my best friend. They got Simon. He didn't take his own life, I fucking knew it. I felt like shit... they were after ME, he just got in the way... 



Suddenly I was grabbed by the two men who jack had summoned, and they pulled me to my feet and slammed me up against the tree I was chained to. Jack began laughing once again, as he produced a nail gun from a box beside a nearby tent, ""Please no! NO!"" I begged as he drew nearer, laughing maniacally now. His laughter boomed in my ears and his saliva splattered all over my face as the nails shot through each of my hands, securing me to the tree.



I remember wanting to pass out but I couldn't. Jack then began dancing around and screaming ""I TOLD GET ON FEET I WARNED I WARNED TO STAND UP ON GROUND NOT BE ON GROUND I TOLD GET ON FEET I DID"". Watching him with tears in my eyes, I screamed ""just fucking kill me! fuck you!"". He stopped suddenly, and glanced at his offsiders. He motioned his head toward me and said ""SHOW THAT ONE HAPPY ONE HOW WE ONE NOW US"". I remember this dialogue perfectly. It was so ridiculous, it was utter gibberish yet it made perfect sense. The offsider produced a mirror, held it up and slowly approached me. As it drew closer I realized. That is why I couldn't speak, that's why I was in pain, I cried as I gazed upon my giant, wide stretching smile.



The entire group began laughing in that strange childish laugh. Jack held up his hands after a while of this and said ""BACK IN BUILDING NOW THIS ONE STAY HERE THIS ONE DONT GET TO EAT THE LOVELY FOOD HE STAY HERE AND HE WILL GET TO BE ONE OF PEOPCO SOON BUT NOT YET HE STAY NOW"". So I stood there, face full of staples, nailed to a fucking tree. I stood there for days on end until I finally passed out.



And here we are. In the month between when I arrived to the day I made my escape, I played the part perfectly. I gained their trust, but I did not conform to their ways. I understand how they work now, how they operate. They are called PEOPCO. Pronounced ""PEE-OPP-CO"". They are a society, a cult. They are incredibly well equipped, once I saw what went on inside I was no longer surprised that they were able to track me the way they did. They worship a man named Jack Smile.



Yes, he is just a man, but to his followers he is a God. They believe in a world in which everybody worships Jack, and they truly believe that by taking people one by one, eventually they will spread their message far and wide. This is flawed on so many levels, but it doesn't have to make sense to be dangerous. I have to go now. It was a risk to even connect to the grid long enough to post this. I'll check back again if and when I can. Farewell for now, and allow me to leave you with this final warning…

1pq9vfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pq9vfe/peopco/,PEOPCO,"First time poster here. I don't have much time, I need to get this out there. I don't know where to start, I'm scared to keep all this inside, but I'm terrified to relive it. Please, bare with me. I will not be sharing my real name, and don't even bother trying to email me, it's a disposable email. As soon as this is posted I will cease to exist again.



I've been running for months now, trying to stay one step ahead. It's true what they said. It was all fucking true. I see flashes of it in my mind. Short sentences that didn't make one ounce of sense at first. I see it when I try to sleep.... ""SEE SOON"", and ""WE COME YOU DONT CHOOSE"". FUCK! I'm going crazy just thinking about it! Ok, I'm going to calm myself down, and I am going to tell you my story, from the start, in every detail I can remember. Here goes………



It was just coming into Winter when this all began. I remember because the night it began I was enjoying a nice warm caramel latte. It started off seemingly harmless. I should probably mention, I am male. That is the only personal information I will be sharing. I'm not exactly popular, so I was intrigued when the facebook friend requests started coming through. I didn't know what to think of these people. They all had strange, weird names about different animals and things like that. I don't really remember the specifics, too much has happened since then. I do remember one about a chicken, I think?



Anyway. So here's where the foundation of this story comes into play. Scrolling down the list of requests I see one that stands out. I was instantly creeped out when I saw it. The picture itself was ridiculous, a disgusting looking 40 something year old, stretching his mouth with his hands to totally unnatural proportions. His head was bald, his face was pale and his eyes..... there was something about those eyes..... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. His name? Possibly the weirdest factor here, his name was Jack Smile. Strange huh? But that wasn't what creeped me out. There was something about looking at this guy that gave me a bad vibe. Sitting there, I was overcome with this feeling that SOMETHING was wrong. I shook it off, probably my mind running in overdrive I thought. I didn't accept the request, but I didn't think anything more of it either. I closed my laptop and decided to play some playstation before bed.



Waking up the next morning, I looked at the clock and realized I had overslept BIG TIME. I struggled to get out of bed. I felt like shit, like I had just popped a bunch of valium. I could not keep my eyes open. Deciding I had already wasted enough of the day I forced myself to stand up and go and get some much needed caffeine. On the way out of my room I opened up my laptop ready to jump on and check some emails, catch up on social media, you know the daily norms. But as the laptop screen powered on and revealed the facebook website, I noticed an unusual amount of notifications. As I said I'm not the most popular guy so this was totally out of the ordinary for me. Feeling pretty chuffed with my seemingly newfound popularity, I went and got myself a coffee and came back.

I sat down and hastily clicked the notifications icon. My stomach.... LITERALLY ...... DROPPED. 



Well, not literally, but I understand the saying now. It felt as though my stomach was falling, over and over again. There in front of me were hundreds of notifications, letting me know my posts and photos had been PUBLICLY SHARED. One by one I scrolled down, seeing endless notifications reading ""Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your status, Jack Smile shared your..."" and on and on and on! Feeling beyond creeped at this point, I navigated to this guy's profile. There in front of me were ALL of my posts and photos, dating right back to when I first joined Facebook. Why? I kept asking myself ""why?"". Why was he fucking doing this? Is it someone I know playing a stupid prank? Not wanting anything further to do with this individual, EVER, I swiftly hit the 'block' button.



At this point I think it's important to point out that I am a privacy freak. My Facebook profile is hidden. My I.P is hidden. Everything is locked down. I'm a hermit, not even my best friends know where I live. Important information to keep in mind for the purposes of this story. So anyway, I had him blocked, and I set an alert via a browser extension to sound a bell whenever the words ""Jack Smile"" were identified. Thinking this was the end of it, I carried on checking my emails, and got on with my day.



About a week went by, perhaps longer, I'm a little hazy. Everything was normal. No friend requests, no weird random post shares. I had just about forgotten the whole thing. It was Saturday afternoon, and I was caught up on all of my assessments (I was studying online at this point). It was a nice day outside, and I hate nice days and outside, so I decided to jump on the PS4 and play some battlefield. Partied up with my buddy (we'll call him Simon), and started searching for a match.



We ended up playing for hours, it was the most fun I'd had in a long time. I was just about to tell Simon that I was heading off to grab some dinner when his voice became shaken, then fell silent. I was worried, I shouted for him to answer me for about 2 minutes before I got a response. Still audibly shaken, Simon just managed to get his words out ""D..d.dd....dude..... Someone just messaged me on ..... on PSN...... he knows your fucking name dude....."". I knew instantly. I knew what was happening, my heart began to race and that feeling in my stomach returned and hit me like a tonne of bricks.



I didn't want to know, but I had to ask; ""Who..... who is it man?"". Simon responded with those two words I dreaded to hear, ""Jack.... Smile..... it's someone named Jack Smile"". I felt like crying. Who the fuck was this guy and why was he so hell bent on contacting me?? I had to know, I just had to know... ""Simon..... what the fuck did he say?"". Simon, still shaken, read the message out to me, it read...

""PEOPCO KARL THOMPSON!! DONT BLOCK JACK!!! HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME!!”.



I was in disbelief. A state of utter confusion and panic. Who is this guy? Realizing I had been silent for about 5 minutes straight processing all this, I snapped back to reality remembering Simon was still on party chat, ""are you all good bro?"" I asked him. Simon responded ""Dude.... how the fuck did he know that I knew you?"". I hadn't even considered this until now. Not only does this guy know my name, but he knew I was on PSN, and he KNEW who I was gaming with at that very moment. Looking back now there is absolutely no doubting that he was watching somehow. It's what they fucking do. They watch, they sit and watch as your sanity fritters away.



Anyway, back to the story. I apologize, my mind is all over the place. I said my goodbyes to Simon, and told him that it's probably best that we only speak over the phone from here on out. He agreed, and told me that he would call me tomorrow to check up. I thanked him for that, he was a good friend. I powered off my console and decided to check on facebook before bed, I was seriously contemplating deactivating my profile at this point. I went to the fridge and grabbed myself a cold bud. I fucking needed it. I chugged it back, every last drop before grabbing another one and heading back to my laptop. I opened it up, and would you believe it? Another friend request and a buttload of notifications. I clicked the friend request, hesitantly.



When I saw who it was, I slammed the laptop shut so hard I'm amazed it survived. There was a friend request from Jack. Spelled ""J@ck Smyle"". He knew. He fucking knew! He knew that I had set an alert on my browser, remember I mentioned that?? He MUST have known! Why else would he spell his name that way?! There was no other explanation. This was creepy before, but as far as I was concerned it had just become dangerous. There was no doubt in my mind anymore, whether online or closer than I thought, I was being stalked.



I didn't get one ounce of sleep that night. The sun came up and stung me un-forgivingly through my bedroom window. I felt like trash. My phone had gone flat, so I put it on to charge before heading out into the kitchen to grab a shitty microwave breakfast. I threw it in the microwave, and threw it in the bin as soon as it was done. It smelled worse than I felt. But I digress, returning to my bedroom I checked my now slightly charged phone, 4 missed calls. Fuck. Could it be? I stared at them, they were all from a blocked number. I couldn't even trace it. I jumped as the phone began ringing again.



Blocked number, again. I answered it and sat on the line silently. A voice came through, ""Karl!"". I was shitting bricks. No holding back now, I responded ""I don't know who the fuck you are or what you want, but I will find out and I'll be handing your information to the cops. Back off"". I felt pretty good about that, and the line was quiet for a moment before the voice came over again ""Dude! It's Simon you idiot!"". Dammit, now I felt like a piece of shit, I had totally forgotten he was going to call me. I responded ""I'm so sorry man, I saw the blocked number and thought it must have been that fucking mouth dude"". Simon was understanding of this, ""It's all good bro, I was just callin' to check in, but I have to go now, I love you bro"". And he hung up.



That was weird. Everybody loves their best bro, but no one says it, especially Simon and I. Looking back, if I hadn't been so overtired my mind probably would have been better able to put it all together. Why Simon had called me from a blocked number when he never had before, why he was in such a rush to hang up the phone, and why after all this time he felt the need to tell me he loves me. It wasn't until I caught a glimpse of the patrol car pulling up outside my house, and answered my door to a police officer informing me that my best friend of the past 20 years had gone missing that I pieced it together.



I broke down, I can barely remember that moment. It's all a blur. I do remember one thing though, I just couldn't figure out why the police had come to me, if this is a missing persons case then why weren't they out there searching? And why me? I thought they only contacted direct family? I picked myself up off the ground, turned to the officer and put my questions to him. His response still tears me up inside to this day. He put his hand on my shoulder, looked me in the eyes and said, ""Because he mentioned you in his suicide note... I'm so sorry son”.



I don't remember much of the following month. I fell into a deep depression. My life was alcohol and sleep. I was barely eating, I would drink and pass out only to do it all again the next day. They never found Simon's body, and I was so drunk 24/7 I forgot about his funeral. I missed my best friend's fucking funeral. After about a month of this self abuse I was finally able to pick myself up and start getting back to normality. I contacted my course provider and apologized for my absence. I managed to sweet talk my way into beginning my studies again, under normal circumstances I would have been kicked out.



Things were looking positive. But isn't it always the case, just when you think everything will be ok, and the metaphorical sun is shining at its brightest, the dark clouds return. Yeah, you guys guessed it, I opened facebook and there they were, hundreds of notifications, ""Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile..."" and you get the idea. All of a sudden I wasn't scared, I wasn't anxious, I was just fucking angry!



No more, I'm going to talk to this asshole and find out what the fuck he wants. I clicked on his profile and initiated a private message session. I'm going to copy and paste the message session below, I'll tidy it up a little so it reads clearer, but I'm going to leave his responses in tact so that you can get an idea of what I was dealing with here, and what to look out for…



*Me: Ok. Own the fuck up asshole. Who are you and what do you want?*

*Me: You have seen this message! answer!*



*Jack Smile: HELLO TO KARL THOMPSON HELLO*

*Me: See WHAT?!*

*Me: Fucking explain yourself idiot. Are you saying you are coming to get me?*



*Jack Smile: YES IT IS THAT*



*Me: Ha! good luck finding me asshole.*



*seen*



This was when EVERYTHING turned upside down on me. This is when I realized I was outclassed. 2 minutes later, this asshole, I shit you not, drops a PICTURE OF MY FUCKING HOUSE IN THE CONVERSATION! He followed this up by saying ""PEOPCO SEE SOON"" before immediately deactivating his facebook account within seconds. I screamed when I saw this. I jumped out of my chair and ran around my house closing every window, drawing every curtain and locking every door.



My fight or flight reflex was in full effect and I was ready to kill ANYTHING that came near my house. I don't remember anything after this, I remember my breathing becoming incredibly rapid and short as I shot quick glances around my dark house in every direction, I remember becoming light headed, and I can only assume I then passed out.

  
I remember waking up on the floor the next day to a knock at the door. My head being in scatters I walked to the door and answered it. There was no one there. That's weird, oh well. I then remembered the previous night, it all came back to me in that one moment and I was instantly gripped in fear, my entire body ran ice cold. I slammed the door and locked it. I got straight on the phone to the police. I had to report this. I didn't ever want to find out what the fuck this PEOPCO shit was.



I called it in, and I had to go into the station to file the report. I hated having to leave the house. I was on edge the entire time. My anxiety was killing me. And you know what? After all that the fuckers wouldn't even help me. They said ""There's been no physical contact"" and as far as they could tell it's just some internet troll. I knew better. Feeling defeated, I began the walk home. I lived in a small town, so no big deal. The worst part was knowing that freak could be anywhere. I've never felt so exposed. Walking home, I felt naked, like there were eyes right on me the whole way. Then I noticed it, it was faint, barely audible. And it had been with me the whole time. I assumed it was bugs or.... I don't know.... something. But no, I was mistaken. I looked up above me and there was no mistaking it, there was a fucking drone! A very small one but it was undoubtedly a drone. As soon as I spotted it, it flew away.



I've never made it home so fast in my life. I collapsed on the floor and cried like a bitch for hours. I didn't know what else to do. I was scared to be in my home, I was scared to leave my home. I was scared to engage in the digital world. Even online I could feel those watching eyes on me. I disconnected my wifi, I unplugged my PS4, I shut down my laptop and I took the sim card out of my phone. I wondered to myself just how long he had been watching.



Emotionally and physically spent, I crawled into bed. I laid there for hours, my mind running in overdrive, trying to think of any reasonable explanation for all this. But there wasn't one. I was hearing strange noises. Laying there, I was convinced it was all in my head, that I was being driven to insanity, then suddenly a thought him me, and I physically felt my face turning pale white. The fucking laundry door! How could I be so stupid?! I forgot to lock it the previous night!! I jumped out of bed and ran to my bedroom door, stopping at the last minute. My mind froze as the reality of what was happening ceased my entire body in fear. Laughing. I heard laughing INSIDE THE HOUSE. It was.... ridiculous! It was like a childish, babyish laugh, but clearly coming from a grown man. I heard scratching, and laughing, the laughter became louder and louder and suddenly BAM! I heard a door slam shut.



I sat, pressed up against my now locked bedroom door until morning came. I picked up my collectors edition Yankees bat, and slowly walked outside. I crept down the hall, the slightest noises were causing my heart to stop. I turned and walked into the laundry. What I saw caused my legs to collapse underneath me. I fell onto my knees and stared, incapacitated by fear and disbelief, at three large words carved into the wooden wall... ""PEOPCO SEE SOON”.



He was in my house. He was IN MY FUCKING HOUSE. There was nothing left to do. I had no options left but to hole up in here and either wait this out or die. I called a taxi and got dropped off at the hardware store. I bought the biggest, toughest looking door locks, chains and padlocks I could find. On the way back home I told the cab driver to take me to a bar. I spent the next hour intoxicating myself, before buying a case of bud to go and catching another cab back home. I fortified the shit out of my home, cracked open my case of beer, rested my baseball bat in my lap and waited....... and waited.............. and waited.......... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I began to relax, I plugged the TV back in, opened another beer and kicked back. Perhaps this is just the moment he was waiting for, because it was then that I felt it, a sharp pain, something tiny and sharp being driven into the back of my neck. I was thrown into a small panic, then all of a sudden, before I could even figure out what was going on, I was completely calm. Then it all went black.



The next part of this story is incredibly difficult for me to tell, I apologize if my writing seems sloppy, I apologize if you struggle to understand it. I'm doing my best to stay focused here. In some strange way this is therapeutic, but it's not easy. So, here goes…



The next thing I can remember is waking up. It was hot, like really fucking hot. And I was thirsty. I sat up and began to take in my surroundings. I saw dry mountains, bushland, a wooden fence spanning miles it seemed. Then I remembered, the pain in my neck, someone sedated me. It's the only explanation. This was it, whoever had been following me, they had got to me. I tried to stand up but I couldn't, I was still too weak. I felt like crying, if you think you've felt genuine fear, you haven't. Trust me. I ripped at the chains that bound me for what felt like eternity, I pulled until I was bleeding and then I pulled some more. It wasn't until the sun began to fall that the hopelessness truly sank in. There was nothing I could do. I had no idea who these people were, what they wanted, and there was nothing I could do but wait. I didn't know what they were planning, but you don't chain a person to a tree if you have good intentions for them, I knew that much. The fear was killing me. I was totally awake an conscious at this stage and it was all beginning to sink in, I was probably going to die. It's a strange sensation let me tell you, the fear is brutal, but the certainty of looming death brings a strange sense of calm. So I did what most in my situation would, I laid down and waited. Just waited. What was the point in trying? It was over, I lost. I laid there for hours just going over this whole thing in my head, over and over again.



It was then I heard it. That fucking laughter. That childish laughter I heard in my house that night, but it was coming from a group. Yeah, there were a lot of them. People just like me I wondered? The laughter grew closer, and louder. I closed my eyes and waited. I wondered to myself how they were gonna do it, would they just shoot me? Would they stab me? I kept my eyes closed and waited for the inevitable. Then I heard his voice, I just knew it was him, ""GET UP FROM GROUND!"" he said. It was SO strange, if my situation was not so dire I would have laughed, he was screaming at me, and yet his voice was full of happy tones. I looked up. It was him indeed, it was Jack fucking Smile. Again he said ""GET ON FEET OFF GROUND!"" in that weird angry/happy hybrid voice of his. That in itself was unsettling. I tried to speak but I couldn't. I tried to tell him that I was too weak to stand but I could not talk, my mouth hurt, it hurt really fucking badly. Not surprising, I was sore all over.



He then walked quickly toward me doing that weird laughing thing, he grabbed my arm and pulled me up, he had a gigantic smile that stretched over his entire face, he laughed as he pulled me to my feet only for me to collapse again, and the process was repeated over and over. I managed to get out the words ""I cant stand I'm too weak!"". He stopped laughing, and his smile grew, somehow that giant unsettling smile grew larger. He held up his hand and shouted ""HERE YOU OTHER PEOPLE"" which I assumed means ""come here"". Two other men walked over to me. It was then that I noticed the large group standing around me.... and then I noticed their faces. I instantly threw up whatever was left in my stomach. It was disgusting. I looked again to confirm what I had seen and threw up again. Every person here was smiling. No, I don't mean they were happy, I mean they were smiling, permanently.



Their faces, all of them, were full of industrial grade staples, morphing their mouths into a gigantic smile similar to Jack's. I have never, and probably will never witness anything quite as disturbing as this. I glanced around the group. Some of them were visibly crying, sickeningly contrasting the unnatural smiles on their faces. Some of them were still bleeding around where the staples were pushed in. And some of them, perhaps most unsettling of them all, were visibly enjoying themselves. Then I saw him.... in the back, barely recognisable. I broke down into tears as I spotted my best friend. They got Simon. He didn't take his own life, I fucking knew it. I felt like shit... they were after ME, he just got in the way... 



Suddenly I was grabbed by the two men who jack had summoned, and they pulled me to my feet and slammed me up against the tree I was chained to. Jack began laughing once again, as he produced a nail gun from a box beside a nearby tent, ""Please no! NO!"" I begged as he drew nearer, laughing maniacally now. His laughter boomed in my ears and his saliva splattered all over my face as the nails shot through each of my hands, securing me to the tree.



I remember wanting to pass out but I couldn't. Jack then began dancing around and screaming ""I TOLD GET ON FEET I WARNED I WARNED TO STAND UP ON GROUND NOT BE ON GROUND I TOLD GET ON FEET I DID"". Watching him with tears in my eyes, I screamed ""just fucking kill me! fuck you!"". He stopped suddenly, and glanced at his offsiders. He motioned his head toward me and said ""SHOW THAT ONE HAPPY ONE HOW WE ONE NOW US"". I remember this dialogue perfectly. It was so ridiculous, it was utter gibberish yet it made perfect sense. The offsider produced a mirror, held it up and slowly approached me. As it drew closer I realized. That is why I couldn't speak, that's why I was in pain, I cried as I gazed upon my giant, wide stretching smile.



The entire group began laughing in that strange childish laugh. Jack held up his hands after a while of this and said ""BACK IN BUILDING NOW THIS ONE STAY HERE THIS ONE DONT GET TO EAT THE LOVELY FOOD HE STAY HERE AND HE WILL GET TO BE ONE OF PEOPCO SOON BUT NOT YET HE STAY NOW"". So I stood there, face full of staples, nailed to a fucking tree. I stood there for days on end until I finally passed out.



And here we are. In the month between when I arrived to the day I made my escape, I played the part perfectly. I gained their trust, but I did not conform to their ways. I understand how they work now, how they operate. They are called PEOPCO. Pronounced ""PEE-OPP-CO"". They are a society, a cult. They are incredibly well equipped, once I saw what went on inside I was no longer surprised that they were able to track me the way they did. They worship a man named Jack Smile.



Yes, he is just a man, but to his followers he is a God. They believe in a world in which everybody worships Jack, and they truly believe that by taking people one by one, eventually they will spread their message far and wide. This is flawed on so many levels, but it doesn't have to make sense to be dangerous. I have to go now. It was a risk to even connect to the grid long enough to post this. I'll check back again if and when I can. Farewell for now, and allow me to leave you with this final warning…

1pq9v72,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1pq9v72/why_people_pleasing_will_ruin_your_relationships/,Why people pleasing will ruin your relationships (I learned this the hard way),"I used to say yes to everything. Every request, every plan, every favor. I thought being agreeable would make people like me more.

Instead, I lost myself completely and watched my relationships fall apart one by one.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about people pleasing that nobody talks about:

You become invisible .When you never have opinions, preferences, or boundaries, people forget you exist. You're just the person who goes along with whatever. There's nothing interesting or memorable about you.

People lose respect for you. Deep down, everyone knows when someone has no backbone. They might use your niceness, but they don't respect it. Respect comes from knowing you'll stand up for what matters to you.

You attract the wrong people. Users, manipulators, and selfish people LOVE people pleasers. They can sense you won't say no. Meanwhile, healthy people get uncomfortable around someone with zero boundaries.

Your relationships become one-sided. You give everything, they take everything. Then you get resentful because ""you do so much for them"" but they never reciprocate. But you never asked them to—you just assumed they should.

Nobody knows the real you. How can someone love you if you never show them who you actually are? You're so busy being what you think they want that your real personality disappears.

You become exhausted and bitter. Saying yes when you mean no is emotionally draining. Eventually, you start resenting everyone for ""making"" you do things you chose to do.

How to break the cycle:

Start saying no to small things ""I can't grab coffee today"" or ""That movie isn't really my thing."" Practice with low-stakes situations first.

Express actual preferences like ""I'd prefer pizza over sushi"" or ""I'm not really into horror movies."" Let people know you have opinions.

Set tiny boundaries ""I don't check work emails after 8PM"" or ""I need 30 minutes to myself when I get home."" Start small and build up.

Stop apologizing for having needs ""I need to leave by 9"" not ""Sorry, I'm so lame but I have to leave early."" Your needs aren't an apology.

Some people will get upset when you stop people pleasing. Good. Those are the people who were only around because you were convenient.

The right people will respect you more for having boundaries. And you'll finally have space for relationships where you can be yourself.

Healthy relationships need two whole people, not one person and their shadow. That's my hard realization after years of people pleasing.",5,1766112316.0,LockedInMan,1,1.0,False

Why is it the second someone gets near the menu, they can't read? The amount of times i've been asked 'oh, whats in this?' and i have to say 'IDK', take the menu they are looking at, and read off of it? You are literally looking at the information, you have more than i do! Use your eyes, please!

Because it is a cafe, we have those table numbers on stalks; the amount of times i will *clearly* put one in front of them and they just leave it behind?! Like bitch, its not for you, its for me so i send shit to the right table! It is in fact not decorative!

On that note; if im bringing food to the table, i dont need you to confirm that this is the right table unless there is only one of you; i am asking who it is for. And then everyone seems to have forgotten who had what; 2 days ago i had a party of 4, 3 of them were burgers, 1 pasta. WHen i delivered them, they didnt seem to know who they were for, i had to just ask them who got something other than a burger. ""oh, me!"" *I will throttle all of you.*

And the amount of people who look at the drinks menu; it is a cafe. It is the same coffee list as every other cafe aside from the Korean tea, why are you looking to see if we sell mochas?

And yes, we have the four standard milk alternatives. I have never had someone asking for an alternative milk ask for something like macadamia, it is always either soy or coconut; *It is a cafe in the 21st century Becky, of course we have fucking soy milk.*

Oh, and put the fucking menus back in their stand, otherwise i have to walk all the way around the bench and put them back myself; it is two feet to the right goddammit.

1pq9sj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Handspinning/comments/1pq9sj9/spinning_for_a_project_that_uses_unspun_yarn/,Spinning for a project that uses unspun yarn?,"I was spinning up this lovely braid of targhee and realized it would look great with something else in my stash (some BFL), then found a project to use both of them in- the [Velvet Moss Vest](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/velvet-moss-vest). I'm planning on using the targhee as the contrast color and the BFL as the main color. The targhee is already spun up as a woolen-spun three-ply (not yet wet finished), the BFL is not yet spun. For the pattern, the main color is an unspun yarn held double with a mohair strand. I realized that I don't know where to get started.

It makes sense to spin the BFL woolen, but beyond that? I've heard that unspun yarns can vary wildly in gauge based on how you're using it. I think I want to do a 2-ply for color management, but I can't tell how tightly or loosely I should spin. Or how thick (WPI) to make the single. Or how much it will bloom during finishing. Or if doing woolen drafting from combed top will be fluffy enough. I've never knitted with an unspun yarn, and I've never spun something so loose, so I don't really have a reference point. Especially since it's held double with mohair in the pattern, which I'm not planning on doing. The pattern says that the two together are roughly DK equivalent, but I have no idea how to spin an equivalent texture. So I want the yarn to be lofty and light, but also not overshadow the contrast color. I was thinking of doing it on my wheel with the 6:1 ratio whorl, to get \~6 twists per inch with a \~30 degree twist angle, but I can't tell if that's the right instinct.

So how would you personally go about spinning for the project if you were making it? I know the usual answer is ""sample, sample, sample"", but I don't have a lot in my stash and I might barely have enough to make the project. I would like to have some sense of direction to minimize the amount of sampling, if possible.

[The targhee is on the left \(Coffee & Contemplation from Into the Whirled\) and the BFL is on the right \(Haunted from Hipstrings\) \(there is wine-purple tucked away in there also\)](https://preview.redd.it/jdfozrr4l28g1.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa98ceaac75560b5e29bae4e78d71d4a6f73a4d)

I'm also planning on using a skein of Cascade BFL in a red-purple color to use for the ribbing, because I doubt I'm getting 600 yards out of 4 oz, unless I do a single. Which I'm not sure would be right for the blotches of color. (Let me know if I'm wrong!)",2,1766112101.0,Handspinning,0,1.0,False

Am I stretching drying too much? It seemed to work well with washed coffee, but now I consistently get signs of tipping, and I’m certainly not tasting any of those fruity flavors I was looking for.

1pq9n8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1pq9n8w/one_thousand_seven_hundred_and_eightysecond_night/,One Thousand Seven Hundred And Eighty-Second Night,"I have quite a lot to tell you about tonight, so much so I'm sure I'll forget a few things along the way. First and foremost, the charlie brown christmas concert with Darling was lovely. As always I was a little sour at being forced out of my hermit hole but once I was out with them, I quickly got into the spirit of things. The concert itself was lovely. A simple three person band - cello, piano, & drums - and they played so quaintly and beautifully. They also had a little choir of children that were also wonderful. I think Darling had an even better time than I did. I was also nice just catching up with them before and after the show. Another sweet surprise, we ran into an old classmate who was also attending the show. It had been so long I didn't even recognize her at first and she was somehow even sweeter than I remembered. Darling was always closer to her than I was but still, I recall being very fond of her back in the day. It was wonderful to see her well and happy.

Now, I am back at home, unsure if I should relax. I got some writing done last night, 570 words. I was busy doing the garbage in-between writing so I only wrote dialogue and left space in the middle to inject descriptions when I write next. I don't know if tonight is going to be when I write next. As you'd expect of me, I was up late again last night and so I am even more tired than I'd normally be after going out. I also won't go into it much, mostly because I have spent all day and night ranting about it off and on in my head, but Mother was a little drunk and a little rude that night. She had the audacity to complain about the gifts under the tree. Too many, she said. She's always been the type to complain about lobster being to buttery and pillows being too soft so to speak, especially after one or many sips. I swear though, she has no right to rant to me about how we're always giving her useless junks after so many birthdays and christmas' getting her things I know for a fact she liked because she is still using it to this day. It seems being perpetually disappointed by horrible family is too ingrained in her sense of self to let a little thing like reality take that away from her. I am trying not to take it too personally given she was a little tipsy at the time. Still, you can understand after how much effort father and I have put getting her gifts why I went to bed steaming.

Anyway, I didn't get any writing done today. I was busy finishing Darling's card and doing so fixes in my room and office. The blinds in my rom fell down months ago and the blinds in my office were on their way to joining them. My parents helped me fix everything up. Hopefully it all holds this time. Now, I get to decide if I want to end the night by writing. It isn't too late yet; not even 10 p.m. But am I willing to put the work in right now? I haven't decided yet. Let me finish my coffee first and we'll find out.

In English people immediately clock it’s a speech thing because I have no accent but in French it just sounds like I’m a complete beginner.

Most people don’t understand the mechanism of a stutter. I describe it as my speech is doped with silent blocks. Repetitions only happen when I try to power through a block. Sometimes blocks are so bad it’s a complete nonstarter and my best bet is word substitution. 

Trying to order a coffee just sounds like “Je vais prendre… um… un … c- …” for 30 seconds in an Anglo accent. Sometimes I used a canned “j’ai un bégaiement et mon français est pas parfait, merci d’être patient” obviously stuttering through that too which feels like overkill for a short interaction.

I (43F) got married the first time when I was barely 18 to let’s call him Edward (50M) who was 25 at the time.

We had been married just over 2 years when 9/11 happened. Edward was in the Army reserve and decided to go active duty Navy. This lead to us eventually moving across the county. We had a great marriage for 5 years after that. Our marriage wasn’t always easy, between being young, so far away from everyone and everything we had ever known and sometimes being apart for so long due to him going underway for unpredictable amounts of time (he was only supposed to be gone for 6 weeks when the tsunami hit Indonesia and was suddenly gone for 9 months). It wasn’t always easy but it was still a good one. He made me very happy. He was romantic, would email me everyday when he could, would send me flowers for no reason, when he was home we held hands everywhere we went, talked all the time, I could go on and on about all the positive things about our marriage but none of that could save it.

I killed it. I was stupid. I was too young. Edward had only ever been with me, I had been with a couple other “men” before I met him. So one night I had a friend over and we had all been hanging out, drinking, watching a movie, etc. One thing lead to another and we started to have adult fun time. I had an unwelcome visitor that week, so I excluded myself and let them continue. Edward asked me what felt like a couple of hundred times if I was sure I was ok with him continuing and I said that I was, I thought that I was. Turns out drunk me and sober me were two completely different people and sober me was not ok with what I watched. That’s why I say I killed it. He never would have done it if I hadn’t reassured him it was ok. And when he realized that I wasn’t ok with it the next morning he tried everything he could think of in this world to fix what I had broken. But I couldn’t see the man I fell in love with anymore when I looked at him, I just saw what he did. He begged me to try therapy, we did. But I half hearted it. It didn’t work. Nothing changed. I was in college so I decided to transfer to a school in a different state away from him and my family and give myself a new start near some old friends. We stayed in touch, we stayed married, we stayed friends, we dated other people, we occasionally talked about me coming home but it never got serious. When I graduated college he was the only member of my family that made the effort to travel across the country to be there for me. He was still in the Navy and had met a girl and she was living with him in our old apartment. I moved back until I found a job after college. I was there for about 3 months. He took me to the airport, he told me that he loved me and said “maybe this just isn’t our time, maybe we’ll figure this all out one day.” I said “maybe” We hugged and kissed goodbye and that was the last time I saw him in person in 2005.

We stayed in touch, talking almost everyday. He dated the girl who he was with when I was there for almost a year. We never talked about getting a divorce but we also never talked about getting back together. He got out of the Navy, moved back home.

Then in 2007 I met the man who would eventually become my current husband (currently 46m) let’s call him Eric. We became friends first and then after about a year we started dating. 3 months later, Eric asked me to marry him. He knew all about Edward. I called Edward and told him about what had happened and to tell him that I thought it was time that we got a divorce. He just simply said “if that’s what you really want then that’s what we’ll do”. 6 months later our divorce was final and 3 months after that Eric and I were married. Eric and I have been married for almost 17 years now.

Edward and I have stayed friends through the years. Time has changed him a lot, we have always been on different ends on the political spectrum but as I’m sure you can imagine like most families and friends we are even farther apart than we ever were these last 10 or so years. We’ve stayed in touch but it’s been much less so over the years, more of birthdays and holidays than anything else. He has changed a lot. He is very religious now, he never was before. We both always believed but had our own issues with organized religion. Now he is what we would have called a bible thumper. He never remarried, he actually hasn’t dated in over a decade because he believes God doesn’t want him to. Talking to him now is literally like talking to a completely different person. It’s like something happened in the last 10-12 years and a switch got hit and everything about his personality that made him who he was, just disappeared. My current husband Eric has spoken to him a few times over the years and has never seem to have a problem with us still being friends.

Ok, so here is current day, Edward had to have surgery at the beginning of the year to correct an issue from an accident when he was serving in the Navy. Well the surgery made things worse. So, Edward has been unable to work for almost a year now. He had to go on VA disability. He eventually ended up losing his apartment and needed a place to live. He was able to couch surf with some family temporarily. But he needs a more permanent place to stay while he has another surgery to hopefully fix what the first one messed up, recover, get a job and get back on his feet. To say that I had a rough childhood is putting it lightly. He saved me from that. We also had a rough beginning financially. He would have had a much easier time of things if he hadn’t had me weighing him down and he very easily could have tossed me aside and gotten help from his family. But he refused to leave me. His mom wasn’t my biggest fan in the beginning (loves me now and still calls me to this day, but that’s a different story). So in a lot of ways I feel like I owe him. He took care of me when he didn’t have to, he protected me and in a lot of ways he suffered for it. And I know he did it out of love. And I probably shouldn’t because it’s been over 20 years but there is a part of me that still and will always feel beholden to him for it.

So when I found out he needed a place to live, I asked Eric how he would feel about Edward coming here for about a year (I’m guessing on a timeline here). Eric knows about my childhood and everything Edward and I went through in the beginning, so I wasn’t shocked when he said it would be fine with him. I also wasn’t shocked because he usually goes out of his way to make sure I am also cared for and happy. But here we sit with Edward supposed to be here in just a couple of days and I am worried that Eric is letting him come just to make me happy. I mean, I know he is doing it just to make me happy, why else would he but I mean, I’m worried that he doesn’t actually want him here. Eric is extremely laid back, we have taken in a number of his friends and family over the years and a few of mine for anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. So this is not an uncommon thing for us to do. We’ve taken in our son’s friends who have needed a place to go for one reason or another. We’ve cared for 6 different members of his family with the aid of hospice through the end of their lives either in their homes or ours over the years. So taking in people in need just seems to be a thing we do. He also has a friend who goes to auctions and buys way to much stuff and has three barns full of almost everything you can imagine and he called him up to see if he had any of the extra things that Edward will need since he will be coming to a very cold climate from a very hot one. I did not ask him to do this he did this on his own. He has randomly over the last three weeks since we made this decision asked me to ask Edward different questions to make sure we have everything he is going to need, weird stuff too. Like do we need to get a second coffee pot or will he drink Eric’s type of coffee. I would like to think that all of that and the fact that he hasn’t been acting any different than he normally does means that he really is ok with this and he isn’t just saying yes to please me. But I’m not a man and even though I have asked him a couple of times and he has always said it is fine and that he knows if the shoe was on the other foot Edward would be helping us. I still worry. I don’t ever want to do anything to make my husband feel uncomfortable period but especially not in his own home. We have talked about this a lot and I have made sure to tell him that after over 16 years (17 in January) of marriage I have never once felt the desire to not be here with him, I’ve never had the desire to go backwards. I consider myself incredibly lucky to be growing old with him. I just think that Edward and I are an anomaly, we were able to end our marriage as friends, we never hated each other, we fell out of love with each other but we never stopped loving each other, we were always family because for years we really were the only family each other had.

Men-Would you be ok with your wife’s ex-husband coming to live with you? Do you think it’s possible that my husband really is ok? Am I just really over thinking things (like I have a tendency to do)?

Women - Am I crazy? 🤦🏻😂

1pq9hua,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pq9hua/an_account_of_the_monsignor_massacres/,An account of the Monsignor Massacres,"It was on the cusp of last winter’s heaviest snow that the rumours of strange visitors began filtering through campus. Being an academic institute removed from the urban sprawl two buses or a moderate car ride away, countless trails and walkways had been carved into the nature reserve backing the facilities down to the water’s edge. The administration had paved and lit several pathways, posted maps, erected information boards, and marked off trails as the adversarial weather or the need for maintenance became more dire. That said, campus authorities did little to curb the influx of students, professors, and staff who needed a common place away from the prying surveillance boasting safety in hindsight.

The first gossip I caught wind of was talk of worryingly tall and lank figures loping down trails whenever people would approach with careless distraction, the beasts, freshman, or stranger disappearing around trees and suggestively obscuring bushes without a trace. There were reports of irregularly proportioned animals standing adjacent to beaten paths without regard to their proximity to folk who tried to approach them. No one succeeded in touching any wildlife—though no doubt many attempts were made by the inebriated or otherwise intoxicated strollers, saunterers, or walkers out for evening or nighttime jaunts—but an unsettling number of reports were dismissed, each claiming that these odd beasts echoed words spoken to them with uncanny, accurate mimicry.

None of these occurrences were ever caught on film, either by institution security or by any of the reporting persons: administration ignored all occurrences, deeming them pranks or unsubstantiated and unreliable narratives. Those administrators fell at once under suspicion with the discovery of the first body. 

Jonathan Flat, the student who found the lacerated pieces of the Maria Whitburg, was immediately thought to be the killer, so fresh was the blood he slipped on and tumbled through as he ran ahead of his gaggle of merry friends. Flat had trod upon a small litter of flayed skin bearing all the tattoos of the deceased; police later reluctantly released Flat despite having no other solid leads on who might dismember the young woman and arrange the mangled sections of her body in geometric concentrations bridged my patterns of blood drawn along the snow-layered earth. Beside her torso that showed evidence of animal mauling at centre, her legs, arms, and severed hands, made for lurid focal points around the unicursal hexagram in which she had been arranged: her head was never found, and it was only by a shoplifting arrest a decade prior that identification of the third-year student could be made. Police swarmed our campus and a manhunt was immediately engaged, though it would fruitlessly escalate in the coming weeks.

The second ritual murder tied to the grisly affair was thought to be a separate incident entirely, so arrogant or uncaring were the city officials when bothering to investigate the brutal slaying of an elderly vagrant man who had made his winter camp under the overpass bordering one corner of the same nature reserve. Unfortunately, too little is known of the deceased and headless man beyond what of his remains were observed; that he was cut and carved with over seventy geometrical incisions prehumously—though none self-inflicted—while under no restraint, alcohol, drug, or any outside influence. 

While the death of a tramp did little to stoke the already burning fires of sensationalism rocking the academic neighbourhood, several live witness reports claiming to see a tall man dressed in a long patchwork coat of garish patterns and mismatched furs openly murdering a child on the lake’s partially frozen surface under the high noonday sun were taken more seriously. Dispatched officers arrived to find the nine-year old Bobby Warren drowned in the icy waters and laid at the centre of a broad circular design marked with unknown glyphs and broken triangles. The daylight slaughter of a child whose abduction and absence had not even been reported erupted news media into a full-throated frenzy. Coroners stated that while the cause of death was consistent with drowning, it could not be said how the child had survived her larynx being ripped out, collarbone shattered, and heart removed all apparently through her mouth prior to her head being plunged into the lake; no other incisions, cuts, or injuries could be found on Warren’s small, underdressed body.

Like so many of my peers busying ourselves with the season-end testing, I paid little attention to the horrific news despite its proximity to my work and home. Only when I could push my own studies and the endless marking and writing that is an academic’s life aside was I able to give the matter any real attention. My housemate Linz had been a devotee of true crime and had been employed by several papers around the city and relished a fresh perspective to the carnage, such was their fevered article assignments.

“We haven’t had anything like this in the city since—well nothing exactly like this,” Linz said. ”A few serial killers over the years but nothing major since the campus expansions and generous community funding four decades back.” Linz was a tenacious hound of a reporter buried under a pyramid of barely-contained curly hair and and a moist layer of over-producted skin. They breathed through anxiety-flattened teeth from their position at the table’s far end that had been commandeered as a workspace soon after moving in. “If we thought the campus was crawling with postering badges now, the neighbourhood parent groups are going to covering every bare surface with flyers and sanctimonious fundraising. D’you remember the fire two years ago? Getting lunch is gonna be a nightmare.”

“I can’t really blame them,” I mused as I settled into my third cup of coffee since crawling out of bed barely an hour earlier. This’ll be what everyone’s talking about for years, unless there’s a school shooting or a drug bust big enough to prop up an election or marketing campaign.”

Linz did not look up from the array of glowing screens and piles of notepads and printouts mounded around them. “The last time we had one of those was ‘87, and there isn’t enough money coming out of the steel plants to move sizeable drugs through our meagre port.”

I sighed and stared into the over-boiled swill I was forcing down. “All I want for Christmas is uninteresting times.”

“Bad luck, I’m afraid. Santa only comes for the grads who sacrifice the raccoons plaguing the dining halls.”

I could feel my eyebrow arch. “Is that your new angle? Desperate student satanic ritual? Seems pretty low brow, even for you.”

“Of course not,” Linz snapped along with a glare. “Editorial’s given out strict instructions not to use the “S” word. No money in relighting that particular bonfire for some reason no one will say.”

“That’s weird right there. When did tabloids ever refuse a low hanging fruit? No chance your rags have pulled their standards up out of the muck away from amusing us common peasant masses?” Their reply was a silent hand gesture. I shrugged and stood to busy myself with a breakfast more substantial than fluids. “Shame. Well I hope something breaks for you soon.”

I did not yet know that as I was offering my pronouncement that Monday morning, a family of three was being pieced back together in a plain two-storey less than a dozen blocks away. Harmonious neighbours to those living around them, Samuel, Lidia, and their daughter Paula Vargas were found seated at their prim dining room table, held fixed in position by meticulously pinned and tied fishing line spider webbing the room. Each of the Vargas family had their hands severed and suspended above their place settings cupped together as if in offering. Their feet had been lopped off and placed near the front door like misshapen pairs of boots. Mass exsanguination had occurred, pooling under the table and penetrating to the basement apartment rented by one Stephen Correa, who called in the wellness check that had summoned police. Decapitation of the Vargas family had occured posthumously, and three sets of eyeballs were aligned within yet another blood-drawn geometric design filling the tabletop; none of the three heads were recovered.

For the first and only time, the killer had left direct correspondence, which was almost immediately leaked despite the fury of the police commissioner. Written on the napkin set for a fourth and absent diner in an elegant if antiquated and ligature-heavy italicized script, was a note that simply read:

“Apologies for the mess. Jêhana draws closer, and the steps must be placed if the path is to be traversed. I appreciate your belated diligence. Msgr.”

To say that the press had a field day would be under selling what followed: the police department was all but crucified. People from all walks of life—children and infant always catching the most attention— had been brutally and ritualistically slaughtered, at least one in broad daylight, and the police were no closer to catching the perpetrator. As for the note, Monsignor (abbreviated to msgr) became the talk of the town. The city’s first prolific serial killer had a nom de plume, a flair for the grotesque and dramatic, and was politely thanking the police for their shoddy work.

For their part, all forensics could say was that the writing utensil used was likely a fountain pen or a feather quill. The blood fashioned as ink appeared to be a family mix, most likely from the puddle beneath the table. Handwriting analysis made a brief resurgence despite being roundly discredited by more professional reporting.

Much fuss and speculation concerning Jêhana was made. Whatever or whoever it was, there was no consent. Religious groups pronounced it as a demon, devil, some new moniker from a children’s video game, and a rising left-wing socialist movement. Secular sources claimed it to be everything from a cult, a new social media trend, an emerging hate group, or just a taunting nonsensename. All guesses were equally unlikely, with no answer in sight. Monsignor made no further announcement.

No small attention was paid to the killer’s assumed name. Calls for investigation into pastors and reverends across the city were expressed by news media and several mobs that were quickly and forcefully disbanded. Despite the season, church attendance plummeted city-wide. With the end of term at last arrived, students who might typically stay close to campus left in droves. The first heavy snowfall blanketed the nature reserve and its surrounding localities in sombre, drifting silence.

It was midway through the week when I got a strange series of texts from Linz.

“Something’s happening in the reserve. I don’t know what exactly but there’s a migration or something weirder going on.“ Attached was a video overlooking the water taken from one of the higher paved trails. Dozens of animals of all kinds were trotting out of the woods towards the waters edge, scrambling across what was frozen, and tossing themselves into the frigid wet. None of the animals seemed interested in each other, only what they were pursuing on the other shore. “Ever seen or heard of anything like this?”

“No, that’s messed up!” I replied. “What are you doing in the reserve? Are you trying to get axe murdered‽”

“I’m fine. I’m going to stick around and see how long this goes on. If you don’t hear back from me in a few hours, call someone.“

“Not funny. It’s not safe out there after dark.“

“Thanks, unwanted mother dearest. I’ll be sure to tuck myself in where it’s nice and safe and warm and enjoy a meal with my family. Oh wait.”

“Asshole. Seriously though, keep me posted.”

The next text came hours later well after nightfall. “So I worked my way around and over the bridge,” Linz wrote. “Turns out the animals have been walking out of the trees without a care in the world. Strange but not enough of a story. I’ve been following this coyote with a black stripe on its tail by a few paces, and it hasn’t looked back at me once. Then it leads me to what I can only describe as a fuck circle.

“All these animals, they keep going towards this common point. They cross some invisible line, find another of their species and they start copulating like their life depends on it. It’s a goddamn furry orgy out here. That’s messed up enough, but it’s way more unnerving that none of these critters are trying to eat each other. There’s this tangle of wolves on top of rabbits and squirrels and dogs and cats and every goddamn thing that lives in the trees just going at it. It sounds like the gates of hell, I shit you not.

“I followed the edge of the circle, or at least where I think the edge is, and I end up stepping out of the woods onto this posh suburban street. The houses here are all gated or decorated with stone lions and shit. Old money here. So I’m walking around the edge and what do I spy as the epicentre of this furry free for all is this big event hall. This place is done up all in lights, there’s cars everywhere, sparkly banners flying from the windows, it’s a whole goddamn to do. Seems like tonight is this big winter fundraising gala with all the big wigs from downtown coming to rub  elbows.

“I’m freezing after trudging through snow for the last two hours, but there’s a story here. I’m gonna warm up, grab a bite, talk to my editor, and get back out here. I bet my left ass cheek that something is going down tonight, and I’m going to be the one to break it.“

Linz was absolutely right. What would later be called the Monsignor Massacre, or the Blood Orgy Killings, was to date the worst scene of carnage in our city’s history. I won’t bother going over the fine points—enough has been written about that night—but any hope of the police quietly handling the murders and bringing them to a close evaporated amidst a sea of politician, power players, moneyed interests, officials, and high ranking bureaucrats that were all involved or evidence to be involved in a mania of horrific sex, bloody violence and high fashion debauchery. At the end of it, seventeen notable persons had been gruesomely killed, cannibalized, defiled, and been subject to unspeakable horrors, while not a single guest or support staff escaped without grievous mutilation or serious harm. I don’t know when the city’s brass is going to fill the power vacuum left by the sudden vacancy of mayor, chief of police, diocese-presiding bishop, district attorney, key lobbyists, and the heads of some very old and wealthy dynasties.

I don’t know how Linz’s managed to get inside, but their photos and videos sold like wildfire. Not only could the salacious scandal be enough to dominate the new cycle seemingly without end, my friend’s articles were the first to mention and tie in the mass animal death that occurred adjacent and surrounding the scene of so much human tragedy. Over two thousand desiccated animal corpses were recovered, all seemingly dead of malnourishment, dehydration, and exhaustion, all dead within a period of twenty-four hours leading up to the gala event.

Home was quieter than usual for a week with Linz’s understandable absence. When we next shared a meal that was to be our last, their appearance was both haggard and stricken with a possessed obsessiveness I hadn’t before seen. They were estranged from sleep, time torn between press meeting rooms, courts, a brief overnight in jail, several expensive hotels, and visiting with attorneys and threatening officials. Now a known-name reporter, they hadn’t been much downtime; fevered research had filled what few quiet moments Linz had been able to find.

While I was basking in my freedom from responsibility, their lines of questioning had become more and more convoluted as their visits to various halls of power had left them leaning more suspicious and conspiratorial than ever. “Everyone’s leaning hard on the cult idea now, but that feels too tidy. I keep coming back to the note,“ Linz mused while we ate dinner over a bottle of red wine I’d been gifted (unsuccessfully bribed by a student) for a special occasion. “I think it’s closer to a where, not a who. I know it doesn’t feel like a building could take a stroll, but something doesn’t feel right thinking about it as a person. Maybe an event or some grand ascension.” 

“Any luck with your cult digging?“ I asked, spearing an indecipherable triangle from my stir-fried bowl. The black sauce coating it was choked with scallions and sesame seeds, and I thought to myself, “Is this what it’s like to be tarred and feathered?”

“I just might have.” Linz enthusiastically nodded. “Like I said, there’s still a lot of cult talk; everyone involved is dead or supposedly in custody, but I’ve been thinking that the whole massacre might be backwards. No one cares about the animals outside of a weird detail, but it’s the damn coyote I was following that keeps getting under my skin.

“I’ve spent two nights scouring archives for strange animal phenomenon and one of the overseas libraries I’m subscribed to dug me up a scan of a norwegian journal by this guy, Olf Birkedotter—kind of a book of days, more like a diary where he kept finding weird animal sightings and became way too into them—and the thing reads like one of those end of the world preppers. Every month he finds heralds of the end times, but in the June entries, the animals around him go nuts. He’s finding carcasses, tracks without start or end, animals all mashed together into these mutated abominations. Then people start disappearing from the next town over. The priest in his town is denouncing this other place as hell-bound sinners getting what they deserved, and our guy is eating it up.

“Was there a—“ I interjected.

”Yeah, you guessed it,” Linz said with their crooked, wolf grin. “Olf found a fuck circle. He followed some sheep that broke out of their pen—broke out mind you, not escaped—followed them and found half his town’s herds going at it in this clearing in the woods he swore was never there, and he spent his life in those forests. He tells his pastor and gets waved off. Some animals being animals. Then all the livestock turn up dead, and our writer gets run out of town.”

“Oof. So much for not shooting the messenger. Poor Olf.”

Linz shrugged in between quick swallows. “They needed somewhere to put their fear; we haven’t grown much in the last seven centuries since.”

I chewed thoughtfully, mulling over their findings, as well as my own investigation into whether I was swallowing tofu, mushroom, or heavily processed and keenly shaped meat protein, delicious in its spicing though it was. Eventually I offered, “That seems pretty solid as far as weird happenings plaguing a medieval countryside go.”

The reporter across from me winced. “That’s the good news. Around seven hundred years ago, something weird looking the same as now happened.”

“And the bad news?”

“Olf got driven off, but all that meant was that he didn’t go to the closest town for his supplies; he’s living that hermit life so no big issue. But when he goes to the next closest, the damned town of sinners, folk there are gossiping about how the rapture visited his old town. There was some big fire and a runner came and told sinner town to be ready because ‘the lord is welcoming the pure and innocent into his grace,’ or something like that. The translation software I was using could only do so much.”

I twirled my fork idly between my fingers as Linz finished eating. “Anything else?”

“Only pertinent notes in the week leading up to the end of June was that the woods were heavy with woodsmoke and dread approaching the solstice.”

“Ah. Not the best omen.”

Linz coughed a laugh. “Honestly a pretty tame omen in a diary dripping omens from each and every day. But the priest throwing stones at the town next door and then the town gets raptured or hit with some kind of catastrophe that almost sends everyone packing—it kind of got me thinking about hot spots. Maybe this Jêhana that’s approaching isn’t so much a thing as it a place, or a certain state of a place. Timing seems important. Nothing so grandiose as celestial alignments, but maybe the same way you can see a backyard during daytime and at night you know it’s there even if you can’t see in the dark. You can still SEE it in your mind even if you can’t see in the dark, but it‘s still the same place. The same location and if the right things happen, the place gets truer to itself.”

“Sounds ship of Theseus-y.” I leaned back and stared at the swirling patterns emerging in the dull popcorn ceiling hanging over us. An errant spider danced upside down along the pebbly terrain.

“Something like that. I’ve got a weird hunch I want to follow up on, but just do me a favour, okay? Stay inside for the solstice.”

“I don’t even know when that  is. Are you fully wearing a tinfoil hat now“

“Shut up and just stay inside Saturday and Sunday. It’s not like you’re out on the town every night anyway.“

“I go out! I go do things. I see people. I might even have a date this weekend.“

Linz fixed me with a bored, dubious look. “Do you have a date this weekend?”

“It’s early in the week: give me time.“ I said in mock outrage.

“It’s Thursday. Please stay in this weekend. There’s something bad in the reserve.”

The next day passed without incident and despite my jeers I had no real intention of pushing myself through the toil of arranging a date that would require me to dawn more than my cozy cold-weather sweat pants and fuzzy robes of increasingly ridiculous size and padding, even if the prospect of meeting someone new for romantic dalliances was of passing interest. My academic life and career had not afforded me many accommodations for romance, such were my areas of study, and the dating pool made up of my peers did more to drive me to a nunnery than elicit temptation or lust.

Nevertheless, I could not ignore the odd electric tension that I woke into that fateful Sunday. I had not seen Linz all weekend, and approaching noon my nervous tension broke.

I texted, “I don’t think you came home the last two nights, are you alright?” Twenty-three fretful minutes later I received my reply.

“Hunting down a lead. I’m close. I’ll know by noon.”

“Watch yourself. No point following a lead if you become the main story.” Linz started to reply but no text came through. Three blinking dots was all I received voicing their disagreement.

Noon came and went. “The world’s not ended, you still alive?” I sent, immediately regretting my attempt at a joke. Three damn dots. I called and it went to message. I called five more times over the next hour. I knew Linz would be furious if I called the cops on them. What would I even tell them? The reporter who just broke the scandal that killed your bosses is missing for an hour? I clutched my cold, half-drunk mug of spiked coffee and stared out at the sullen winter behind the frost-vignetted glass . The world outside lay sleeping under a soft blanket of white  while gossamer curtains of drifting sparkles tumbled down, glimmering in the harsh sunlight. 

I yelped and almost threw my phone across the room when it rang in my hand. 

Linz’s voice was panicked, hollow, and full of coughs. “Hey, it’s me. I found it—found Jêhana. I was too fucking late. I was on the right track, but I took too long to get here. Just ended up following the smoke through the trees, then when the way got denser, it was easier to follow the screams. They’ve been burning for hours now. Police are on their way. This thing, this is so much bigger than I thought, I—

“I was right and wrong. This is a place, a specific place in the reserve. That’s where I am now. I’m not moving from this place, I can’t right now, I just—look, I know none of the pigs or suits are going to believe me, so just hear me out. I just need to say it so I know I haven’t gone off teh deep end yet. This place wasn’t just a physical or temporal place—it’s both really—but it’s like a weird way of thinking. I started to get it, but then I got here to the clearing, and there were kids all lined up and just walking into the fire—I tried to stop them, but He was there, and everything went sideways. He did something to me, took my fucking eyes, but I can still see everything—it‘s like melted wax flowing everywhere, because I had eyes before, and now I’m thinking like this, and it doesn’t make sense, but I can see where I’ve been and am and will be going, and it feels like my head’s going to explode.”

Several hacking coughs and ragged gasps followed as my housemate fought for breath. I could almost smell the woodsmoke, the sticky fat-swelled acrid smog that was rising up into a swollen column of pitch. My hands were shaking.

Linz continued their recounting. “I can hear sirens closer now, thank god. They’ll be here soon as they get through the trees. I have to say this now before they get here. I’m sorry if they drag you into this—I’ll do what I can to keep them off you—I just needed to say it to someone, you know? Before I get slapped with “crazy asshole” and thrown into prison or some asylum.” 

The klaxon wail of police sirens rose louder and louder in the background, and the reporter’s tone became harder as it hushed. “Monsignor’s dead in front of me. I wish I had killed him but I didn’t. I don’t know if I could have, even knowing everything he’s—it doesn’t matter. Whatever that psychopath was doing, he managed to get Jêhana to come to him, or he forced it to be here, and then got himself thinking Jêhana and the murdering jack off did what he set out to do—he won alright—he just didn’t understand the path was one-way the wrong direction. Monsignor kicked opened the fucking door but couldn’t step through: something else came through instead. He came through. I don’t know where that oily bastard went after arm fucking Monsignor’s throat, but I don’t really care. Fucker took my eyes, went all melty casually walked off, stretching the snow as He went. He strolled away without a care, and now I’m trapped here in dim Jêhana. 

“Don’t come, I won’t be able to talk for a while. Thanks for everything and sorry for what’s next, I guess.” Linz said, their voice straining. The line went dead. I hadn’t managed to get a word out through their testament. 

I stared at the phone in my hand for a while. I couldn’t think of anything so fiercely that I started floating away from my thoughts, watching myself go rubbery as I teetered to my feet and followed myself already moving into the bedroom to put on real clothing, chasing the ghosts of before and after images of my body moving in slow deliberate motions, dressing and doing exactly what I’d been told not to. I saw it was coming, but I couldn’t do otherwise; it took painfully stubbing my toe to pull me back into myself, disassociated thoughts scattering as the blinding pain and crumpled nail channeled all my focus.

The cold winter air offered me no comfort, simply silent, watching weariness dragging on my bones. The black smoke plume licking at the pallid blue sky was direction enough, and I stomped through as yet unplowed streets. My friend had already been carted off and the trails cordoned and patrolled by the time I made my way down into the ice-bitten and hail-pocked reserve. I was turned away with stern warnings for my trudging troubles, angry officers barking at the crowds that were already forming and trying to figure out how best to bypass the roadblocks and circumvent the emergency tape binding trees together.

Monsignor’s murderous finale brought a terrible closure to the death spree. Linz’s testimony corroborated by the host of witness reports outlined a chilling schedule. Midmorning Sunday saw seven teenagers carry their infant siblings out of their respective houses—each front door having been carved and painted with the same circular blood graffiti overnight—and make their way down into the nature reserve to a previously unidentified clearing. A large A-frame bonfire had been prepared by Monsignor and was set aflame at noon. Each teen appears to have walked into the blaze at Monsignor’s direction and was promptly burned alive, each waiting their turn for self-immolation as if they were luxuriating in line for the last carnival ride of their young lives. For unknown reasons, campus security and the on-duty park rangers did not notice the notable column of black smoke, or ignored the obvious fire hazard for undetermined reasons. Linz arrived at the scene of the crime at 4:21 PM to find Monsignor dead at the foot of the hours-burning ritual pyre containing the charcoaling children victims. By the trails of footprints, Linz collapsed in the snow, immediately calling 911. Emergency services arrived on scene to find All twenty-one children ranging from several months to fourteen years already dead. Linz was still kneeling in the snow on the edge of hypothermia, intermittently laughing wretchedly and manically sobbing; their eyes had been burnt out of their head despite surrounding tissue showing minimal fire damage. The reporter was taken into custody and taken to hospital under armed guard while the sacrificial ritual site was processed.

Endless accusations, speculations, think pieces and allegations followed. My now-absent housemate lived shuttled between hospital and courts by sole reason of being the only living witness. Despite the horrible lambastations hurled at my friend, they endured their public pillory with stoic grace and removal, though I imagine that was at their attorney’s direction. I have not managed any contact with Linz. I have somehow avoided media attention almost entirely, though how exactly I cannot imagine. My friend has since been shifted in the spotlight to become the victimized reporter seeking justice unjustly punished for getting to close to the truth. There has been no mention of any strange footprints left in the snow that changed shape before disappearing, and the identification of Monsignor’s killer remains a mystery. I miss my friend, but their recovery is a long, dim road ahead of them, if such miracles are even possible.

Of late, I have been filled with a growling loneliness that has begun to fray the edges of my sense. My thoughts are too often displaced, hence this account, and I have not yet been able to return to my post. My alien and morphing disassociations have become more frequent as I dwell on this matter and how its invisible scars have been left even on those only tangibly related. I fear it to be so, but if there is any cursed truth to Linz’s parting words, heed me now as I unravel: 

Do not seek Jêhana or dwell upon its meaning. Fear and shun Jêhana and those who whisper its presence. Fear the path.",1,1766111262.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I jolted upright.

Stale air escaped my lungs in quick, shuddering bursts. Adrenaline surged through my newly awakened veins, pulsing its manic rhythm into the back of my eyes - the familiar war drums of an approaching panic attack.

Across the room, the door sat quietly in the darkness.

*There was no knock. It was just a dream.*

*Calm down.*

*You need to calm down.*

My ears perked, searching for noise.

Ancient floorboards groaned as they teetered over their termite-stricken support beams.

Wind howled through the valley, causing some loose rain gutters to clink rusty metal against the rafters.

A gag bubbled across the back of my tongue, imagining the filthy, contaminated air pawing at the sides of my house, painting the stone veneer pitch-black with its disease, its pesticides, its toxic emissions and its cancerous oxides.

But that was it.

*See? No more knocks, because no one’s here, because no one can be here. Also, why would anyone even bother breaking in? For your vast riches? For you? Give me a break.*

Still, my buzzing nerves refused to settle.

I swung my jittery, sweat-caked legs over the edge of the mattress, sighed, and raised both hands in front of my chest.

*Three quick taps to the right collarbone. Three long taps to the left collarbone. A final three quick ones on the right. Inhale, exhale.*

**Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.**

It was the last vestige of therapy I’d managed to hold on to.

**Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.**

Always soothing, always centering. With every repetition, my mind cooled. The pattern never failed to bring me home.

Then, gently, almost lovingly:

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I stared at the door.

**Knock...knock...knock.**

Suffocation seared deep gashes into the base of my throat.

**Knock-knock-knock.**

The latch bolt clicked, and it creaked open.

Not fully.

Only an inch.

I froze. My wild heart thumped, marching along the underside of my sternum, battering its cartilage, threatening to spring from the confines of my rib cage like the jester of a blood-drenched jack-in-the-box.

*The nearest house is ten miles away.*

*None of the alarms went off.*

*Who the fuck is standing out there?*

A series of dull, sluggish thuds emanated from the hallway, quieter and quieter as the seconds crawled on. Not exactly footfalls. The noise was muddy. It lacked discreteness: no separation of one foot from the next. The thuds were more like an overfilled burlap sack being heaved across the floor, items audibly shifting within the coarse fabric with each pull.

My bulging eyes remained fixed on the moon-touched darkness spilling in from the cracked doorway.

I shifted forward. The wood was cold on the balls of my heels, biting at the exposed skin. I stood. A long, shuddering moan exploded from the plank bowing beneath my weight.

My entire body tensed. Psychic pain ran dizzying laps along the length of my spine, up and down, up and down.

*God...they must have heard that.* 

I listened.

I waited.

Silence.

A razor-sharp vacuum of sound.

Then, from a further distance: the knocks. Same pattern. *My* pattern: tainted, defiled, bastardized.

The thuds resumed.

I bent over, drew an aluminum baseball bat from under my bed, and crept towards the door. Pearly moonlight trickled across the room, filtering through the pines outside my second-story bedroom window, manifesting a dancing panorama of ghostly shapes as the branches wavered in the wind.

I *could* have escaped, right then and there.

I *could* have opened the window, climbed down the tree, and sprinted through the forest in the direction of the nearest highway.

Hell, I *could* have just jumped. The ground wasn’t that far. Good odds I would’ve limped away with a few bumps and bruises, nothing more.

It wasn’t an option.

*I’d rather die than leave this house.*

I flattened myself against the wall and peeked my eyes over the doorframe.

A large, amorphous shadow lingered motionless at the end of the hall. They were wide enough to fill the hallway, but short, barely tall enough to rise above the railing. Jagged edges protruded all along their silhouette: from their thick torso, from their broad shoulders, from their slender, box-shaped head - everywhere. A malformed clump of black fangs on an ominous patrol.

I squinted. Cocked my head side to side.

*What in God’s name are they wearing?*

Halfway between us, a narrow beam of moonlight descended, illuminating a column of dust in its angelic glow. My gaze drifted upwards. I threw my hand over my mouth and wrenched my head from the doorway. A wail churned in my throat. I fought desperately to keep the noise contained.

There was a small, circular hole in my roof.

The perimeter was compromised.

My hand fell from my lips. I grasped my chest, practically clawing at its bones. My lungs became a bonfire.

*I’m already breathing it in. I can feel it sinking into me, chewing on my scars. I’ll be wheezing soon. Then the gnawing breathlessness, and then...*

A phantom sensation took hold of me.

It was the feeling of a tube sliding down my throat, icy plastic compressing my airway, overriding my will, forcing gulps of filthy atmosphere inside of me before promptly sucking it all out, every single scrap of oxygen until my lungs deflated like a balloon.

My fingers, on autopilot, guided solely by muscle memory, rose to tap my collarbone.

They only collided once:

**Knock.**

The sound was impossibly resonant.

I snapped.

I scrambled over to my nightstand, bare feet slamming into the wood. The bat fell from my sweaty hands. The hollow metal collided with my bedframe, and a high-pitched, melodic clamor tore through the room. Coughing, I ripped the drawer off its hinges and sent it crashing to the floor. Pens and hard candies and loose change scattered around me as I dug through its contents, stopping only when I found what I was searching for: a facemask and a roll of heavy-duty tape.

I threw the mask on and stomped into the hallway, my mind a hazy, screaming blur. The ceiling was thankfully low. I lifted myself onto the treacherously slim railing that overlooked my foyer, reborn as a living paradox - driven utterly fearless under the influence of mind-shattering fear.

My trembling hand reached towards the hole in the ceiling. Steam gathered around its perfectly circular, concrete margins, but the air wasn’t hot against my fingertips; it was painfully cold, downright glacial. I slammed a torn edge of tape into the stone.

It was mushy. Gelatinous. A chunk of concrete was displaced upwards by my meager touch.

Disbelief roared through my body.

The piece of tape didn’t stick. Instead, it fluttered down, swaying delicately, a falling leaf in a bitter November wind. My other hand stretched to catch it.

I slipped.

I could see up through the hole as I fell.

There was an unnaturally bright, yellow-tinged star in the night sky: a shimmering speck of amber bejeweling the firmament.

The back of my head smashed into something hard.

A blip of pain,

then everything turned black.

\- - - - -

I had the strangest dream.

It’s 2021.

I’m back in New York City, entombed in a sleek, minimalist apartment high above the city streets. I’ve been out of the hospital and off the ventilator for a few months, maybe half a year. I’m staring outside, petrified by the disorder, the raw chaos of it all. My dread calcifies into swathes of tiny, pus-stained crystals, clogging the arteries that feed my heart, causing the vessels to swell painfully in my chest.

I start tapping on my collarbones.

Craig sneaks up behind me.

He startles my frayed nervous system.

I jump, twisting around to face him. My ex-husband is rolling an overstuffed suitcase behind him. Dirt-stained socks and books dog-eared with hundred-dollar bills are leaking from small slits in the front zipper. I’m not sure why I didn’t hear him approach. The wheels of the suitcase rattling against the tile are borderline deafening.

Once again, he chastises me. Says something like:

“If you’re dead-set on living the rest of your life as a fuckin’ germaphobe, the least you could do is keep the apartment clean.”

I correct him, coldly, clinically - the way I wanted to correct him when it really happened.

“I’m not really germaphobic. Broadly speaking, I’m agorophobic. If you want to be more precise, I guess you could label me ‘aerophobic’, though that usually refers more to a fear of flying in a plane, rather than a fear of the air itself...”

He waves a dismissive hand in my general direction and turns to walk away.

Craig doesn’t get very far.

After a few steps, his body melts.

The man completely liquifies into a puddle of molten skin and soggy clothes. No skeleton is left behind. The handle of the suitcase flops onto the human reservoir with a wet smack.

I’m upset, I think. Something close to upset. At the very least, I feel decidedly alone.

But not for long.

The puddle quivers. Convulses like there’s an earthquake in the distance.

The steaming fluid springs to life.

It snaps up, congeals to everything around it, and begins to animate...

\- - - - -

I jolted upright.

My back muscles lamented the sharp movement, crying out in agony. I winced. My skull throbbed something vicious. Hot, labored breaths pushed against the inside of the facemask.

The coffee table broke my fall.

The house was dark. Every room was quiet.

No thudding,

no tapping,

and no knocking.

I hoisted myself off the fractured glass top and stood. Nagging shards dug playfully into my heels. The pain barely registered.

*Was anyone ever really here?*

I pivot my aching neck. Judging by the bleary green dot aside the front door, the alarm system was still primed. All five deadbolts remained tightly latched, silver chains curling between the door and its frame, twinkling in the moonlight.

*Moonlight...*

I swung forward, eyes wide, knees weak, nearly toppling face-first into the shattered remains of my coffee table before catching myself.

And there it was.

A single, quiet beam of moonlight streaming through the enigmatic hole in my ceiling, skewering my perfect bastion like a spear through the gut. My eyes traced its descent. The same beam glittered silently in my first-floor restroom.

*Something plummeted through the roof, but, Lord, how far down did it go?*

I limped over to the open door and flicked the light switch. The trajectory was clear. Whatever fell, it plunged through the ceiling, through the upstairs floorboards, and finally through the basin of my shower, a few inches from the drain.

Everything around the point of impact had changed.

Or, more accurately, was *still* changing.

A bevy of white acrylic cysts encircled the small hole. Most were the size of a tennis ball, but the largest among them was nearly the size of a fire hydrant. Engorged and pulsing, a phosphorescent liquid dribbled from the cysts. A smaller one audibly popped as I observed them, releasing the liquid and a smoky, metallic scent into the air, like the aroma of a pork chop if you could grill it with gunpowder.

The hole continuously exuded wisps of steam.

I followed one of those wisps up the shower wall.

Right where the steam appeared to concentrate, a tuft of strawberry blonde hair grew from the tile, attached to the ceramic by what looked like a patch of scalp. Clearly, it was my hair. I'd lose a strand or two when I showered, but never a whole godforsaken tuft.

*God, Christ, I need to go.*

*But where* ***can*** *I go?*

I flicked the light switch off.

*I’ll just have to hide.*

Blackness enveloped me.

Then, to my right:

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I didn’t turn.

**Knock...knock...knock.**

I couldn’t bear to look.

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I just ran.

The foyer passed by in a messy haze. My body howled, each accumulated injury its own voice in the agonizing cacophony. The small of my back spasmed, the muscles kicking like a mule. Hot blood dripped down my pounding head wound. My lungs ignited. Viscous breath like coal smoke sputtered from my cracked lips.

The heaving thuds were only a few steps behind me.

I reached the door and started unlatching the deadbolts.

One. Two. Three.

**Thud. Thud. Thud.**

Four, and five, and -

**Thud.**

My hand gripped the knob.

I could open the door.

I hesitated.

God, I hesitated.

**Thud. Thud.**

The phantom tube began to slither down my throat once more. The icy plastic. The filthy, filthy atmosphere.

*TURN.*

*TURN YOUR GODDAMNED WRIST.*

**Thud.**

My hand fell from the knob.

I couldn’t bear it.

I just couldn’t bear it.

I turned around, put my back to the door, and slumped to the floor.

It was only a few feet in front of me.

A hallucinatory amalgam of steaming flesh and strawberry blonde hair, ornamented with random pieces of my home. They jutted from its corpulent center with no apparent order or intention. A faucet head from its left flank. Vinyl records fanning from its chest like an exotic bird puffing out its plumage. There was no head on its shoulders; only the narrow apex of an antique clock. As it thudded towards me, the fixture chimed four AM. The sound was muffled and coarse, emanating from within its shuddering hide.

It towered over me. Globs of the phosphorescent liquid drizzled at my feet, like it was slobbering. The amalgam's copious steam distorted the surrounding atmosphere.

I waited.

I braced for the end.

No end came.

It began sliding away from me.

The amalgam heaved forward a few inches, then paused. The faucet head swiveled, then protruded, revealing a length of red, spongy muscle driving the metal. The curve knocked a familiar pattern into a nearby wall.

*My* pattern.

Then, it started moving again.

*It doesn’t want to hurt me...it doesn’t want anything.*

*It’s aimless. No goal, no purpose, no point.*

*It’s just wandering.*

*Spinning its wheels.*

*Trapped.*

The parallel was hard to swallow.

Tears welled. I choked back a few sobs before tearing the mask from my face, launching it across the room. As my hand recoiled, I accidentally smeared a drop of the amalgam’s fluid onto my pinky finger.

The tingling only lasted for a second.

Then, I began changing.

A nub of malignant flesh burst from my pinky finger, shattering its nailbed. An overdue scream finally billowed from my chest.

It was another pinky finger, glistening with blood.

I sprang to my feet and sprinted into the kitchen. I placed my thumb into my palm and they congealed together. Additional fingers exploded circumferentially from my pinky, eviscerating the original digit. They pushed into each other with malignant indifference, growing, expanding, becoming a hellish latticework of oozing stumps. I didn’t bother with the lights, nor a cutting board. The change was spreading. I had no time.

I raised the butcher’s knife.

*You can choose to live.*

I raised the knife even higher.

*Or you can choose to let yourself die.*

The blade fell like an avalanche.

*Can’t have it both ways.*

**Clunk-clunk-clunk.**

A vortex of electric agony detonated across my wrist.

I screamed.

I screamed again.

There was warmth. Profuse, distressing warmth. Eventually, the static simmered.

When I could manage, I looked down.

It was done, and it seemed to have stopped the spread.

*Make a choice.*

I wrapped the wound best I could and left the writhing mass of fingers on the countertop.

Then, I sprinted for the door.

I jolted upright.

Stale air escaped my lungs in quick, shuddering bursts. Adrenaline surged through my newly awakened veins, pulsing its manic rhythm into the back of my eyes - the familiar war drums of an approaching panic attack.

Across the room, the door sat quietly in the darkness.

*There was no knock. It was just a dream.*

*Calm down.*

*You need to calm down.*

My ears perked, searching for noise.

Ancient floorboards groaned as they teetered over their termite-stricken support beams.

Wind howled through the valley, causing some loose rain gutters to clink rusty metal against the rafters.

A gag bubbled across the back of my tongue, imagining the filthy, contaminated air pawing at the sides of my house, painting the stone veneer pitch-black with its disease, its pesticides, its toxic emissions and its cancerous oxides.

But that was it.

*See? No more knocks, because no one’s here, because no one can be here. Also, why would anyone even bother breaking in? For your vast riches? For you? Give me a break.*

Still, my buzzing nerves refused to settle.

I swung my jittery, sweat-caked legs over the edge of the mattress, sighed, and raised both hands in front of my chest.

*Three quick taps to the right collarbone. Three long taps to the left collarbone. A final three quick ones on the right. Inhale, exhale.*

**Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.**

It was the last vestige of therapy I’d managed to hold on to.

**Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.**

Always soothing, always centering. With every repetition, my mind cooled. The pattern never failed to bring me home.

Then, gently, almost lovingly:

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I stared at the door.

**Knock...knock...knock.**

Suffocation seared deep gashes into the base of my throat.

**Knock-knock-knock.**

The latch bolt clicked, and it creaked open.

Not fully.

Only an inch.

I froze. My wild heart thumped, marching along the underside of my sternum, battering its cartilage, threatening to spring from the confines of my rib cage like the jester of a blood-drenched jack-in-the-box.

*The nearest house is ten miles away.*

*None of the alarms went off.*

*Who the fuck is standing out there?*

A series of dull, sluggish thuds emanated from the hallway, quieter and quieter as the seconds crawled on. Not exactly footfalls. The noise was muddy. It lacked discreteness: no separation of one foot from the next. The thuds were more like an overfilled burlap sack being heaved across the floor, items audibly shifting within the coarse fabric with each pull.

My bulging eyes remained fixed on the moon-touched darkness spilling in from the cracked doorway.

I shifted forward. The wood was cold on the balls of my heels, biting at the exposed skin. I stood. A long, shuddering moan exploded from the plank bowing beneath my weight.

My entire body tensed. Psychic pain ran dizzying laps along the length of my spine, up and down, up and down.

*God...they must have heard that.* 

I listened.

I waited.

Silence.

A razor-sharp vacuum of sound.

Then, from a further distance: the knocks. Same pattern. *My* pattern: tainted, defiled, bastardized.

The thuds resumed.

I bent over, drew an aluminum baseball bat from under my bed, and crept towards the door. Pearly moonlight trickled across the room, filtering through the pines outside my second-story bedroom window, manifesting a dancing panorama of ghostly shapes as the branches wavered in the wind.

I *could* have escaped, right then and there.

I *could* have opened the window, climbed down the tree, and sprinted through the forest in the direction of the nearest highway.

Hell, I *could* have just jumped. The ground wasn’t that far. Good odds I would’ve limped away with a few bumps and bruises, nothing more.

It wasn’t an option.

*I’d rather die than leave this house.*

I flattened myself against the wall and peeked my eyes over the doorframe.

A large, amorphous shadow lingered motionless at the end of the hall. They were wide enough to fill the hallway, but short, barely tall enough to rise above the railing. Jagged edges protruded all along their silhouette: from their thick torso, from their broad shoulders, from their slender, box-shaped head - everywhere. A malformed clump of black fangs on an ominous patrol.

I squinted. Cocked my head side to side.

*What in God’s name are they wearing?*

Halfway between us, a narrow beam of moonlight descended, illuminating a column of dust in its angelic glow. My gaze drifted upwards. I threw my hand over my mouth and wrenched my head from the doorway. A wail churned in my throat. I fought desperately to keep the noise contained.

There was a small, circular hole in my roof.

The perimeter was compromised.

My hand fell from my lips. I grasped my chest, practically clawing at its bones. My lungs became a bonfire.

*I’m already breathing it in. I can feel it sinking into me, chewing on my scars. I’ll be wheezing soon. Then the gnawing breathlessness, and then...*

A phantom sensation took hold of me.

It was the feeling of a tube sliding down my throat, icy plastic compressing my airway, overriding my will, forcing gulps of filthy atmosphere inside of me before promptly sucking it all out, every single scrap of oxygen until my lungs deflated like a balloon.

My fingers, on autopilot, guided solely by muscle memory, rose to tap my collarbone.

They only collided once:

**Knock.**

The sound was impossibly resonant.

I snapped.

I scrambled over to my nightstand, bare feet slamming into the wood. The bat fell from my sweaty hands. The hollow metal collided with my bedframe, and a high-pitched, melodic clamor tore through the room. Coughing, I ripped the drawer off its hinges and sent it crashing to the floor. Pens and hard candies and loose change scattered around me as I dug through its contents, stopping only when I found what I was searching for: a facemask and a roll of heavy-duty tape.

I threw the mask on and stomped into the hallway, my mind a hazy, screaming blur. The ceiling was thankfully low. I lifted myself onto the treacherously slim railing that overlooked my foyer, reborn as a living paradox - driven utterly fearless under the influence of mind-shattering fear.

My trembling hand reached towards the hole in the ceiling. Steam gathered around its perfectly circular, concrete margins, but the air wasn’t hot against my fingertips; it was painfully cold, downright glacial. I slammed a torn edge of tape into the stone.

It was mushy. Gelatinous. A chunk of concrete was displaced upwards by my meager touch.

Disbelief roared through my body.

The piece of tape didn’t stick. Instead, it fluttered down, swaying delicately, a falling leaf in a bitter November wind. My other hand stretched to catch it.

I slipped.

I could see up through the hole as I fell.

There was an unnaturally bright, yellow-tinged star in the night sky: a shimmering speck of amber bejeweling the firmament.

The back of my head smashed into something hard.

A blip of pain,

then everything turned black.

\- - - - -

I had the strangest dream.

It’s 2021.

I’m back in New York City, entombed in a sleek, minimalist apartment high above the city streets. I’ve been out of the hospital and off the ventilator for a few months, maybe half a year. I’m staring outside, petrified by the disorder, the raw chaos of it all. My dread calcifies into swathes of tiny, pus-stained crystals, clogging the arteries that feed my heart, causing the vessels to swell painfully in my chest.

I start tapping on my collarbones.

Craig sneaks up behind me.

He startles my frayed nervous system.

I jump, twisting around to face him. My ex-husband is rolling an overstuffed suitcase behind him. Dirt-stained socks and books dog-eared with hundred-dollar bills are leaking from small slits in the front zipper. I’m not sure why I didn’t hear him approach. The wheels of the suitcase rattling against the tile are borderline deafening.

Once again, he chastises me. Says something like:

“If you’re dead-set on living the rest of your life as a fuckin’ germaphobe, the least you could do is keep the apartment clean.”

I correct him, coldly, clinically - the way I wanted to correct him when it really happened.

“I’m not really germaphobic. Broadly speaking, I’m agorophobic. If you want to be more precise, I guess you could label me ‘aerophobic’, though that usually refers more to a fear of flying in a plane, rather than a fear of the air itself...”

He waves a dismissive hand in my general direction and turns to walk away.

Craig doesn’t get very far.

After a few steps, his body melts.

The man completely liquifies into a puddle of molten skin and soggy clothes. No skeleton is left behind. The handle of the suitcase flops onto the human reservoir with a wet smack.

I’m upset, I think. Something close to upset. At the very least, I feel decidedly alone.

But not for long.

The puddle quivers. Convulses like there’s an earthquake in the distance.

The steaming fluid springs to life.

It snaps up, congeals to everything around it, and begins to animate...

\- - - - -

I jolted upright.

My back muscles lamented the sharp movement, crying out in agony. I winced. My skull throbbed something vicious. Hot, labored breaths pushed against the inside of the facemask.

The coffee table broke my fall.

The house was dark. Every room was quiet.

No thudding,

no tapping,

and no knocking.

I hoisted myself off the fractured glass top and stood. Nagging shards dug playfully into my heels. The pain barely registered.

*Was anyone ever really here?*

I pivot my aching neck. Judging by the bleary green dot aside the front door, the alarm system was still primed. All five deadbolts remained tightly latched, silver chains curling between the door and its frame, twinkling in the moonlight.

*Moonlight...*

I swung forward, eyes wide, knees weak, nearly toppling face-first into the shattered remains of my coffee table before catching myself.

And there it was.

A single, quiet beam of moonlight streaming through the enigmatic hole in my ceiling, skewering my perfect bastion like a spear through the gut. My eyes traced its descent. The same beam glittered silently in my first-floor restroom.

*Something plummeted through the roof, but, Lord, how far down did it go?*

I limped over to the open door and flicked the light switch. The trajectory was clear. Whatever fell, it plunged through the ceiling, through the upstairs floorboards, and finally through the basin of my shower, a few inches from the drain.

Everything around the point of impact had changed.

Or, more accurately, was *still* changing.

A bevy of white acrylic cysts encircled the small hole. Most were the size of a tennis ball, but the largest among them was nearly the size of a fire hydrant. Engorged and pulsing, a phosphorescent liquid dribbled from the cysts. A smaller one audibly popped as I observed them, releasing the liquid and a smoky, metallic scent into the air, like the aroma of a pork chop if you could grill it with gunpowder.

The hole continuously exuded wisps of steam.

I followed one of those wisps up the shower wall.

Right where the steam appeared to concentrate, a tuft of strawberry blonde hair grew from the tile, attached to the ceramic by what looked like a patch of scalp. Clearly, it was my hair. I'd lose a strand or two when I showered, but never a whole godforsaken tuft.

*God, Christ, I need to go.*

*But where* ***can*** *I go?*

I flicked the light switch off.

*I’ll just have to hide.*

Blackness enveloped me.

Then, to my right:

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I didn’t turn.

**Knock...knock...knock.**

I couldn’t bear to look.

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I just ran.

The foyer passed by in a messy haze. My body howled, each accumulated injury its own voice in the agonizing cacophony. The small of my back spasmed, the muscles kicking like a mule. Hot blood dripped down my pounding head wound. My lungs ignited. Viscous breath like coal smoke sputtered from my cracked lips.

The heaving thuds were only a few steps behind me.

I reached the door and started unlatching the deadbolts.

One. Two. Three.

**Thud. Thud. Thud.**

Four, and five, and -

**Thud.**

My hand gripped the knob.

I could open the door.

I hesitated.

God, I hesitated.

**Thud. Thud.**

The phantom tube began to slither down my throat once more. The icy plastic. The filthy, filthy atmosphere.

*TURN.*

*TURN YOUR GODDAMNED WRIST.*

**Thud.**

My hand fell from the knob.

I couldn’t bear it.

I just couldn’t bear it.

I turned around, put my back to the door, and slumped to the floor.

It was only a few feet in front of me.

A hallucinatory amalgam of steaming flesh and strawberry blonde hair, ornamented with random pieces of my home. They jutted from its corpulent center with no apparent order or intention. A faucet head from its left flank. Vinyl records fanning from its chest like an exotic bird puffing out its plumage. There was no head on its shoulders; only the narrow apex of an antique clock. As it thudded towards me, the fixture chimed four AM. The sound was muffled and coarse, emanating from within its shuddering hide.

It towered over me. Globs of the phosphorescent liquid drizzled at my feet, like it was slobbering. The amalgam's copious steam distorted the surrounding atmosphere.

I waited.

I braced for the end.

No end came.

It began sliding away from me.

The amalgam heaved forward a few inches, then paused. The faucet head swiveled, then protruded, revealing a length of red, spongy muscle driving the metal. The curve knocked a familiar pattern into a nearby wall.

*My* pattern.

Then, it started moving again.

*It doesn’t want to hurt me...it doesn’t want anything.*

*It’s aimless. No goal, no purpose, no point.*

*It’s just wandering.*

*Spinning its wheels.*

*Trapped.*

The parallel was hard to swallow.

Tears welled. I choked back a few sobs before tearing the mask from my face, launching it across the room. As my hand recoiled, I accidentally smeared a drop of the amalgam’s fluid onto my pinky finger.

The tingling only lasted for a second.

Then, I began changing.

A nub of malignant flesh burst from my pinky finger, shattering its nailbed. An overdue scream finally billowed from my chest.

It was another pinky finger, glistening with blood.

I sprang to my feet and sprinted into the kitchen. I placed my thumb into my palm and they congealed together.

They pushed into each other with malignant indifference, growing, expanding, becoming a hellish latticework of oozing stumps. I didn’t bother with the lights, nor a cutting board. The change was spreading. I had no time.

I raised the butcher’s knife.

*You can choose to live.*

I raised the knife even higher.

*Or you can choose to let yourself die.*

The blade fell like an avalanche.

*Can’t have it both ways.*

**Clunk-clunk-clunk.**

A vortex of electric agony detonated across my wrist.

I screamed.

I screamed again.

There was warmth. Profuse, distressing warmth. Eventually, the static simmered.

When I could manage, I looked down.

I’m hosting a Saturday afternoon skating situation at Nathan Phillips Square followed by hot chocolate vibes. It’s giving: winter rom-com montage but make it real life.

Saturday, December 20th, 3-5pm:

	∙	3-4pm: Ice skating at Nathan Phillips Square (yes there are rentals, we’re inclusive of the skate-less)

	∙	4-5pm: Hot chocolate at Good Earth Coffeehouse on Bay & Gerrard (or whatever warm beverage matches your vibe) (iced coffee is also always allowed)

This is a wellness event but like, the fun kind where you actually get to do something and meet cool people—not just another “self-care Saturday” that’s really just staying in bed all day (though we support that too).

I’ll be the one serving looks in a long red coat. Currently about 12 people coming, so it’s an intimate group—not overwhelming, just the right amount of social.

No weird vibes, no pressure, just good energy and seasonal activities. Come through!

Since 2020, our family has been hit with serious health issues (brain tumor, brain surgery, epilepsy), and we are deep in debt. I feel sick to my stomach on a daily basis over this.


My husband had to take a pay cut due to health limitations, and I currently earn very little due to AI's impact on gig work. At this point, we're barely breaking even. I need a guaranteed paycheck...like yesterday.


The problem is...


I have applied everywhere you can probably imagine...Amazon, Walmart, local small businesses, restaurants, gas stations, libraries. I tailor my resume and write cover letters. My phone works. My number is correct. I have yet to receive a single callback.


Without giving too much information, my background is nontraditional, I would say. I only have a HS diploma. For 10+ years, I've worked as an independent contractor doing recruiting, copywriting, editing, transcription, data entry, and some marketing campaigns. I used to make money on advertising revenue for a few sites though I no longer do this. Over the last couple of years, my client work dried up as companies shifted to AI. I have never been a W-2 employee, and I'm wondering if that's hurting me...


I am nearing 40 and struggling to figure out what the hell is holding me back. Is it my age, my resume, or the fact that my experience maybe looks ""overqualified"" for entry-level jobs? I am not above any work. I will do janitorial, retail, customer service. I will wash your clothes, go on coffee runs, walk your dog...whatever is needed. 😅 I'm laughing, but I am 100% serious.


I applied to five more jobs today, all remote W-2 jobs. What else can I do? I am hoping for at least one call by Monday.


If you have ever been in this position or have advice on how to actually get hired when ""everyone is hiring,"" I would really appreciate it. Or if you could just send some good vibes and  good luck my direction, I will be eternally grateful.

“You are my miracle baby. The whole universe conspired to keep you from me, but here you are anyway. My sweet little angel. I love you,” These are the first words Mattie ever spoke to her son. She was covered in sweat, hot tears streaming down her red and swollen face. Thirty hours of labor had wreaked havoc on her body. Waves of black swam in her vision. She thought it was exhaustion, the trauma of childbirth, the complicated pregnancy, but her body was failing. She was conscious long enough to see the shift in the doctor’s expression as alarms started going off. Her first thought was for Gabriel, the newborn weighing so heavy in her tired arms. He was so tiny. How could he feel so heavy? The last thing she heard before her body rebelled and her mind switched off was the nurse saying, “The baby isn’t breathing!” Her eyes shut and the world drifted miles away.

A beat-up VW bus, with chipped and fading yellow paint, rambled along a lonely highway in California. Doug was fairly sure it was California. He had been travelling for weeks, and the various landscapes became a living thing that morphed constantly beyond his windshield. But this must be California. There was the great epic blue expanding out to the orange and pink horizon. He had been desperate to see the Pacific Ocean since he was a boy. There was no blue like this in Kentucky. He had heard stories about feeling dwarfed by the sheer size of it, and he wanted to feel small. He could not explain to himself exactly why, but the urge had driven him to the west coast more effectively than the bus. 

Doug was always big – not heavy, but tall, bulky. As an adult he was 6’4” tall with shoulder length shaggy blonde hair. His face had the symmetry and allure of a movie star, but he had never been drawn to the limelight. California was lousy with wannabe celebrities, but that was not enough of a deterrent for him.

He had been a hero in his hometown, top of his class, star athlete. He had been accepted to a dozen colleges, but he had no real interest in continuing his education - much to the dismay of his father. He was the preacher’s boy, and he had once believed his mother was the ideal homemaker. She was nurturing, devout, and obedient to his father. 

“You’re throwing your life away, Douglas,” his father had told him. The statement was an appraisal. He was not trying to dissuade his son from his choice to take to the road. He was sitting at the wooden table in their bright kitchen, sipping coffee, reading the paper. Doug had been building up the nerve to relay his big plans for days. When he had come in, it was with the air of a boy asserting his manhood for the first time. 

“Father, I have decided not to go on to university. I feel my education and future would be better served with more…hands-on experience. I am going to explore the United States. I have my savings and the…trust-fund…from…” He couldn’t say “mother.” His father did not look up, just turned the page of the paper. “I am 18. I’m an adult. I have thought it through, and…well…this is what I want,” he finished, somewhat lamely. 

His father’s response deflated him. He had expected an argument or at least a heated discussion, but he received one cold, detached sentence. So, Doug took his savings, bought the bus, packed it with everything he could, and started to drive.

He meandered through Kentucky for the first few months, not yet daring enough to be too far from home but eventually set out further. He drove up north and found it too cold. He wound his way through the breadbasket, but it was dull and lifeless. The southwest was oppressive and dry. 

Now, at 22, the years on the road had made him feel like a weary yet wise nomad. He had met hundreds of people, seen every interesting thing the country could offer, but he had waited on California. He knew that was where he was meant to end up and settle down. Everything was happening in the golden state. Nothing happened in Kentucky.

That small town had been choking the life from him. Despite the town’s love of him, the rumors and whispers followed him every step he took. He had to taste freedom, unencumbered by the weight of what he knew his father did - and what the town suspected but could never prove. He knew she deserved it. She practically begged for it - being a whore. It should be illegal to be a whore in a small town, the bitter thought echoed through the years. No secrets have ever been kept in a place like that. 

His father was thoroughly humiliated. He had seen the laughter in the eyes of the parishioners as they walked through the church doors - mocking his father even as they came to him for guided worship. Every Sunday, they would flow through the doors, shake his father’s hand, sit, and listen to his father, then titter and churn out the rumor mill. 

Doug had been in denial for so long - bore the jeers and mocking of his classmates (always behind his back and in abruptly halted conversations), never wavering in his belief that his mother was as close to sainthood as a protestant could be. She called him “Dougie” and doted on him. She had come from a well-to-do family with old money. Many of his classmates told him, matter-of-factly, that the money was made on the backs of slaves. Doug didn’t believe this, but thought, even if it were true, why would he care? His mother had inherited the money, and he would inherit from her. Neither of them had ever had a slave. 

Yet, on that awful night - the night that crept into his dreams so often - he witnessed his mother’s treachery with his own eyes. He was rocked to his core. The same hands she used to soothe him, hold him, care for him, were caressing the face of a man who was not his father. He was walking home from practice when he saw her. It was almost certainly her, even though he had just seen the back of her - the same hair, the same lovely blue dress she wore to church so often. He held his breath and a sliver of doubt when she turned. The streetlight hit her face, and he felt himself sink into the ground under the weight of the image. 

He could not be sure if it was her betrayal or her death that ate away at his soul, and he had to remind himself repeatedly that he did not do the killing. He should have no guilt. He was a dutiful and righteous son. 

He had only been 13 that night. Newly 13. His birthday was the previous month. His mother had baked a large, decadent chocolate cake. It was superb. His friends had all been in attendance at their home. His father had given him a desk set - a large wooden tray containing all the accessories one needed (paper, pens, pen cup, scissors, stapler, ruler, and a few pencils). The message was not subtle: “Schoolwork first.” His mother had given him a new, shiny red Schwinn bicycle, complete with a bell. The gifts were both marked from both his parents, but he knew. 

When he saw his tramp mother with that man, in the back of a Chevelle in the parking lot of the Piggly Wiggly (for all the world to see!) his heart shattered. He sprinted to the church, where his father spent hours studying, writing the upcoming sermon. He charged through the sanctuary and burst through the door of the small office in the back. He was breathless and suddenly terrified. He was certain of his obligation to tell his father, but his certainty wobbled at actually telling, worried he would feel the blunt edge of the sword upon delivering the grievous news. 

“Douglas? Why have you barreled into my office like a wild bull?” his father asked sternly, barely glancing up from the Good Book. 

“I…I saw Mama.” he hesitated. He remembered last month when he confessed, he had seen the Langley’s boy swipe $2 from the collection plate. The back of his father’s hand felt like an explosion on his cheek. He was punished for not stopping the boy and not telling his father until three days after it had happened. What would he do now? But there was no backing out now, not since he knew the truth. His father would know what needed to be done, like always. He summoned his courage but took a step backwards all the same.

“Mama was with a man. Some man. She was…” He trailed off, blushing. They did not speak of such things. It was not Christian to talk about such unsavory things. He did not have the vocabulary to describe it properly. His father seemed to understand without his words. He shut the Book with a snap and moved swiftly from around his desk, standing like an oak in front of his quaking son. He was abnormally tall. He towered over Doug.

“What man?” he asked, his eyes piercing straight through Doug’s soul. This was a holy man. He was a man of God and his father. 

“I don’t know, sir.”

His father’s large hand clapped his shoulder, and he squeezed tight, as if doing so would wring the truth from Doug’s body. “Who was it, son?”

“Paul Newby.” He paused, fearful of looking into his father’s eyes. The grip got tighter, and Doug looked up. His father’s face was livid, his eyes were pools of malice, and Doug couldn’t concentrate on anything but how red his face was. It looked like someone had baptized his father in boiling water. “It’s that insurance man that came to town a week ago. He was peddlin’ those policies door to door. You told him you didn’t want such things. God was the only insurance you needed.” His father had never been so angry. Doug braced for a blow, shutting his eyes, tensing. But it didn’t come. His father’s hand released his shoulder, and he heard a heavy sigh. When he opened his eyes again, his father had resumed his position behind his desk, but glaring at his son. There was a calculating look on his face and a sense of apprehension. He leaned forward; hands laced together upon the desk. He tilted his head slightly to the right and a coy smile flashed as he glanced at the needlepoint on the wall. His wife had made it specifically for his office, celebrating their anniversary. It was Ephesians 5:22 - 24. 

“Go home, boy. Stay home. Say nothing else. Do not mention any of this to your mother.” He was calm in his decision. He knew he would be doing the Lord’s work. After all, the bible was clear on these matters: “If a man commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.” Doug did as he was told. 

He was fast asleep when his father knocked on his bedroom door, waking him and handing him a shovel.

“We must give her a proper burial, son. While her soul belongs to hell, her body belongs to the ground.”

That was all behind him now. Shadows of memories he was determined to leave in the tall grass of Kentucky.

“What a day!” Bethel Callahan, RN thought as she swaddled the infant tightly in a receiving blanket. She placed him in one of the nursery beds and stood over his small form for some time, worried and slightly angry.

The nurse had been delivering babies for over twenty years. She had seen her more than her fair share of damaged infants in that time - and this poor boy was definitely damaged. His skin was jaundiced, and after they got him breathing again, he was jittery and had difficulty with a bottle. She knew the symptoms. The mother was a user - probably some hippie. Who knew what garbage she used to pollute her body and harm her unborn child. It was disgusting. And she didn’t even know the father! This generation had no love of God. It was clear by every action of their sinful lives. That little lady was so confident that he would be a “perfect angel” and that would be true if that equated to small, blue, and unable to breathe. 

The girl was no more than 17 years old and had come in, like all mothers ready to pop (especially first-time mothers), panting, screaming, and petrified. Her father had been holding a ratty old suitcase and frantically calling for the doctors while the girl had one arm slung over her mother’s shoulder, hunched over and in the grips of the latest contraction. Bethel expected some young man to come bounding in the doors after them shouting, “I’m the father!” Her expectation was not met.

“There – Ahhh!” the girl started to say after the doctor asked about the absent father, “There is…Isn’t one! Aaahh!”

“Oh, so we have a second virgin birth?” Bethel thought, scathingly, but kept it to herself as she took the girl, now seated in a wheelchair, down the hall to the delivery suite (suite may have been an exaggeration as it was just a slightly larger hospital room with a baby warmer in the corner). It was a traumatic labor – lasting at least thirty hours. The girl’s body was barely holding up and she passed out more than once from the strain of pushing. She kept mumbling about her “little angel” or her “miracle” as if she were the first girl to ever have a child. Then the tiny thing finally came into the world, red, screaming, and fine – for about a minute. After he was placed in his mother’s arms, he stopped breathing and at the same time the girl began to hemorrhage.

After a few minutes working on the baby, he came around, but the mother was still in surgery. It was touch and go at best. So, Bethel was given the baby to take to the nursery.

Unfortunately, her experience told her that this angel was on his way to the nursery now but on to heaven in just a few days. How many times had she been through it? The little ones just could not survive the cruel reality inflicted upon them by their wayward mothers. 

“Heathen woman,” she muttered to herself and frowned. “The Lord works in mysterious ways” was the automatic refrain. It was the mantra in her head that played daily - hourly, even, and sometimes more - lest she lose her faith entirely. There was no question that angelic Gabriel would spend his whole, wretched and tragically short life paying for the sins of his mother AND father - whoever he might be.

Marvin Jakobs was a quiet, thoughtful man. He had been a soldier in the second Great War - not enlisting as a healthy, young man was damn near criminal. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge, got shot in the leg, and was honorably discharged. He was a local hero for about a month when he came back to Nukwaiya, TN. There was a small celebration at the courthouse and a potluck dinner afterwards. Marvin appreciated the gesture but found it indulgent and embarrassing. He had lost his best friend, Leopold Arnold, in the same battle that provided his safe return home and couldn’t shake the guilt of seeing Leo’s parents at the dinner. Their forced smiles held back an ocean of tears, but here they were, shaking his hand and telling him how happy they were for his return. Leo had written a letter home but never got the chance to send it. Their commanding officer gave it to Marvin, along with the meager trinkets Leo had brought with him overseas. He had these in a small box resting on the table next to him. He broke apart from the hug, picked up the box, and delivered Leo’s final words to them.

Marvin spent a couple of months trying out the city life but disliked everything about it. Finally, he came home, settled on his family’s farm, with a Purple Heart and a permanent limp. Within two years, he courted and then married his high school sweetheart, Meredith LouAnne Pendergrass. She was smart, graceful, and perfect to him. She had raven black hair that she always wore braided – and the braid reached the middle of her back. She had deep, olive skin, honey brown eyes, and she radiated with warmth. There was no woman in the world he loved or admired more than her, except perhaps his daughter, but she came along later. 

Marvin’s father had passed away just before he enlisted. He had been ill for over a year, but the doctor could not find the cause. They called it “the wasting disease” and left the old man to his fate. Marvin sent every dime of his G.I. pay back to his mother. Since he had returned, he could see his mother struggling with the day-to-day responsibilities. It was his duty to take the burden from her. He had five siblings – all sisters – who had all moved away, having lives and duties of their own, but Marvin was eager to take up that mantle. It was hard and physical work, yet, with the help of his mother and his strong and capable wife it was his own small patch of heaven.

They made a decent living from the crops, eggs, and milk produced on their little agricultural enterprise. In time, Meredith was in a family way and all three rejoiced in such a blessing. Matilda May was born in late March of 1948 and Marvin thought no father could’ve ever been more deliriously happy.

From time to time, his sisters came around with their husbands and children. Mattie loved her aunts, uncles, and particularly her cousins. They would play for hours out in the fields, coming back in only when the sun had gone to bed. Their skin would be grimy with dirt, wearing muddy and grass-stained clothes, and pleased as punch with themselves.

Marvin taught his daughter everything he knew because one day he would leave this place to her and did not want his own mother’s struggles repeated. She took to it well and balanced her studies and chores with the grace of someone much older. Blessings upon blessings.

In the winter of 1958, Marvin’s mother got a cough that would not go away. They all begged her to let the doctor come but she refused, saying it was “simply my time to go.” April of 1959, she did go. Marvin buried her next to his father, and made sure there were always fresh daisies (her favorite flowers) laid upon her grave.

Her death had left a dark cloud that hung like a curse over the farm, and a hateful storm flooded them with misfortune and heartache. 

His wife miscarried one child then had another that was stillborn. The doctors had no answers but advised against further attempts at growing their family. Financial hardships started to stack up at his door, while Meredith could not bring herself to get out of bed. They all grieved something new every day, and the slice of paradise he had once been so thankful for now felt like a wasteland. 

While Marvin and Meredith endured many tragic events, young Matilda was unable to understand the agony of her parents, being only 12 when the bad things started. She spent an increasing amount of time alone. Her father did not ask her to help in the field or with the animals. Her mother only left her bed to use the facilities, and Mattie had only a radio and small television set, and her books to keep her company. She got lost in the stories each would tell. Fantasy became her escape and her salvation. She dreamed of big cities and grand adventures, then, looking out her bedroom window, realize how far out of reach those were. She yearned for the return of those sun filled days before her Nana had gone to meet Jesus, but knew the only way to find happiness was to leave. So, at the age of 16, she hopped on a bus and ran away.

Marvin and Meredith were out of their minds with worry. They found her note propped up by her radio on the nightstand in her room. Marvin read her words through tears and blamed himself for her leaving. There could be no fault in Meredith – being left in such a fragile state after what all she had been through.

“Mom and Dad,

I love you both, but I had to leave. Please don’t be mad. I hope that things get better. I am going to California because there are opportunities there that I could never get in Tennessee. Please understand. I will write home soon.

All my love, 

Mattie.”

It had been his job – as a father, as a husband, as a man – to hold his family together and ensure their health and their happiness. He had failed miserably. With what little money they had, he went to California, on a mission to bring his little girl home. 

He did not find her. She did not write. She evaporated into the ether like steam off a puddle in summer heat.

The greyhound smelled like gasoline and urine, but Mattie stepped aboard, concerned less about the odor than the state of her parents (once they found her letter). She knew it would probably be a long time, possibly years, before she could go back to that gloomy farm. 

Her mother was once a vibrant, lovely woman with an easy smile and cheerful demeanor. Her father was always quiet, but enormously kind and patient. It was devastating to watch them both sink further and further down into a pit of sadness when she had no means of pulling them out. She had not heard her mother’s tinkling laughter or even seen her smile in years. Her father spent most of time in the fields, tending to the livestock, and did not play games with her like he did before. They did not see their daughter grieving along with them. Of course, she was sad about her Nana and the babies that were called home too soon, but the grief that overwhelmed her was for the parents she once had, replaced now with ghosts. 

She felt selfish and ungrateful for running out on them, but what else could she do? Stay and drown along with them? Her life had barely started. She made the decision and started saving. She had just over $50, so she packed the essentials, some sentimental keepsakes (like her old dolly and the stuffed bunny her daddy had won for her at the carnival when she was 5 and a few faded photographs removed from the family album), shoes, and other odds and ends into in her father’s old trunk (that he only ever used for keeping extra blankets), filled up her mother’s ragged suitcase with clothes, then hitchhiked to the bus station. 

She saw the other people on the bus as fellow refugees and their expressions ranged from excitement to dread. Their eyes followed her, and she felt naked, exposed, ashamed. But, as she sat down on the cracked leather seat in the back of the bus, she looked out the window and dreamed of hot, sandy beaches, cool salty waves, and a bright, happy future.",1,1766110493.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

For the tenant of 4A, some trauma can’t be buried, run from, or forgotten. Tonight, we stand at her door as the past she’s spent years suffocating finally remembers how to breathe.”

\-4A- 

She always started with the eyes.

Not because she needed to, she could have done the routine in half the time, but because the eyes were the truth. Everything else she put on was a facade: the wig, the dress, the perfume that smelled like someone richer, freer. But the eyes? Those were the one part of herself she refused to lie about.

Her vanity glowed warm against the dim apartment, its ring of bulbs making her small bedroom feel like a backstage dressing room at a show where she was the star. A neat formation of brushes sat before her like a row of instruments. Powders, palettes, lashes, all arranged with the care of someone who had lived many lives and survived them all by building herself anew each night.

She leaned in close, drawing the eyeliner in a sharp, crisp, clean line.

The phone buzzed on the vanity beside her.

She glanced at the screen, saw his name, and rolled her eyes.

Then she went right back to her eyeliner, steady and precise, refusing to give the moment more attention than it deserved.

The phone buzzed again.

A third time.

Then finally fell silent… only to slightly buzz once more after a brief pause, the last vibration alerting her to a new voicemail.

She let it play while she finished the final stroke of her liner.

“Where the hell are you? You think you can just keep me or a client waiting? You think you’re too good to answer your goddamn phone? I swear to God, you’d be nothing without…”

She clicked it off mid-sentence.

“Go fuck yourself,” she said, not shouted, not muttered, but stated with calm authority, like it was simply the next step in her routine.

She smirked at her reflection a slow, knowing curl of the mouth.

She rose from the vanity, slipping into her heels with the fluidity of someone stepping into the armor she’d built for herself. She fastened her necklace, checked the wig’s alignment, adjusted the line of her dress.

Perfect.

No, not just perfect. Controlled.

Control was better than perfect.

She grabbed her clutch, met her own eyes one last time, and breathed in deep.

“You’re fine,” she told herself. Not as comfort, but as command.

Then she clicked off the vanity lights, leaving the room in warm shadows, and stepped out into the night like she owned it.

The carpet of the hotel hallway muffled her heels, each step a soft punctuation in the late evening hush. Room 412. Mid-tier chain hotel. Clean enough, anonymous enough, forgettable enough. She knocked once, firm, not tentative, and heard movement inside, the frantic shuffle of someone rehearsing composure.

The door cracked.

A man in his late thirties peered out, glasses already fogged despite the cool air.

“Uh…hey, hi, you must be…I mean, of course you’re…come in. Please.”

He stepped back awkwardly.

She walked in without acknowledging the babbling. She always liked to let the room speak first: the stale air, the hum of the AC, the flicker from an old lamp. Each place held its own particular brand of loneliness. This one held the smell of bad decisions and coffee.

The man hovered behind her, wringing his hands.

“So, um… I’ve never really done anything like…I mean I have, but not… like this. Not with someone like…not with…”

She finally turned and faced him, the weight of her gaze halting his words.

“Take a breath,” she said, tone soft but intentional. “You’re fine.”

He swallowed like it hurt. “Right. Yes. Sorry.”

His nervousness filled every inch of the room, buzzing around like static. She’d seen a hundred versions of him: the lonely, the shaking, the ones who apologized for existing. This one was harmless enough. Annoying, but harmless.

She let her dress strap slide down one shoulder, watching the effect hit him like a pulse. His posture shifted, still timid, but drawn forward by something primal. His breaths came uneven, shallow.

She closed the distance between them, a hand sliding up his collarbone, her fingers brushing the flushed skin of his neck. He twitched at the touch, then relaxed, then leaned in without realizing he had.

“Is this okay?” she asked, voice barely above a murmur.

He nodded too fast. “Y-yeah. Yeah, I just…I just didn’t think someone like you would…I mean, you’re…you know what you’re doing.” 

She smirked, letting her thumb graze his jaw. “That’s the idea.”

His breathing steadied. He let his hands find her waist, tentative at first, then firmer as she tilted her chin to kiss him; a slow, deliberate kiss, one meant to guide him out of his nerves and into the moment.

He kissed her back, shaky but grateful, almost reverent.

Somewhere between his uneven breaths, he muttered, trying on confidence like a jacket that didn’t quite fit:

“The guy who’s… over you said you’re the type that needs… reminding.”

She let the words slide off her, kept kissing him down his neck, her voice low, coaxing:

“Yeah? Reminding of what?”

That did it.

He straightened slightly, mistaking her tone for encouragement, the borrowed confidence swelling in him like a rash.

He forced out a chuckle, shaky, but bold enough to feel dangerous.

“Reminding that you like to be put in your place by a man who…”

He never finished the sentence, her body reacting instinctively before her mind caught up.

Her knee surged upward, fast and clean, driving into his groin with precision and fury. His breath left him in a single strangled grunt as he collapsed, folding onto the carpet like a marionette whose strings had been severed.

She stepped over him with a surgeon’s calm.

“You should really learn which words belong to you,” she said, scooping the envelope of money from the desk. “And which ones don’t.”

He tried to speak, a half-formed apology, a plea, something pitiful, but she was already opening the door.

She didn’t look back.

Outside, rain had started. She lifted an arm, hailed a passing cab, and slid inside before the driver could say a word. The lights of the hotel blurred in the taxi window as the city swallowed her again. The only place she ever felt truly invisible.

She didn’t breathe until the car merged into traffic, the client’s words still clinging to her mind like a stain she couldn’t scrub off.

“Rough night?” the driver asked, catching her eyes in the rearview.

“You have no idea,” she exhaled, exhaustion slipping through her voice.

“You okay though?” he pressed, grin softening the question.

“I’m fine,” she said, then quieter, to herself, “You’re fine.”

Two days passed without incident. No shaken nerves, no close calls, no men trying on dominance like bad fitting suits. Tonight’s client had been easy. Respectful. Quick. She even found herself humming on the walk up the stairs, a lightness she hadn’t felt in…God, she couldn’t remember.

As she closed her apartment door, her phone chimed.

Funds received.

She smiled. A small, earned kind of smile. The city didn’t give her much, if anything, but at least it paid what it owed. What she earned.

She collapsed into the chair at her vanity, exhaling as she slipped off her wig, letting the weight fall away piece by piece. Lashes, lip gloss, foundation. The ritual always felt like shedding skin, like returning to the person underneath.

She lifted a makeup wipe to her cheek, dragging it along her jawline.

The pad came away streaked, not just with foundation, but with a faint blush of pink, like the shadow of fingers pressed into her skin.

She frowned, leaned closer.

Not a bruise. Not really. But unmistakably the shape of a hand.

Her breath caught.

The room dimmed around the edges.

And then…

She was younger, smaller, standing near the door of a cramped apartment that was cluttered with all the things he insisted were “theirs” but were really just his. That apartment, that life, never quite felt like hers. Never was hers. She stood there sobbing, a half-packed bag hung from her hand. Her eyes were red. She’d run out of tears but kept crying anyway.

“I’m done,” she whispered. “I’m leaving.”

He laughed. Actually laughed. Then his face sharpened. He strode toward her with the slow, practiced swagger of someone who believed he owned every inch of her.

“Leaving?” he repeated, voice dripping with contempt. “You can barely leave this room without falling apart.”

“I mean it,” she said, though her voice wavered. “I can’t do this anymore.”

He grabbed her face in one swift, brutal motion, fingers digging into her cheeks, forcing her gaze up to his.

She gasped, her mouth puckered involuntarily as it was pulled into a distorted ‘O’ beneath the pressure.

“You really think,” he hissed, “anyone out there is gonna give a shit about you?”

Her eyes watered. “Please…”

“You can’t run back to your daddy,” he sneered. “And nobody else is gonna want you, or take you in. You hear me? Nobody.”

His grip tightened, nails biting into her skin. “Hell, you’re lucky I even bother with you.” He leaned in, stared at her as if he was a predator fixated on its next meal. 

“You’ll be back. You always come back.”

Then he shoved her face away like she was a nuisance, not a person. Just something he’d grown tired of touching.

She staggered, then lunged for her bag, slipping out the door as he kept shouting after her:

“You’ll see! You’ll crawl back…that’s all you know how to do!”

Her reflection stared back at her, older now, harder, stronger, but that faint pink imprint on her jaw had cracked something open.

A tear welled in her eye.

She blinked fast, jaw tightening, refusing to let it fall.

The sadness swelled, shakily, painfully…

Then burned.

She pressed the wipe across her cheek with a sharp, angry motion, scrubbing away the smudges that resembled a vague palm print until the skin beneath flushed red for real this time.

The cloth hit the vanity with a slap.

She inhaled, forced her shoulders back, forced the steel into her spine again.

“You’re fine,” she muttered, then firmer, as if daring the past to contradict her:

“You’re fine.”

The restaurant was the kind of place where time felt slowed on purpose. Soft jazz humming somewhere unseen, candlelight pooling in gold around polished silverware, and glasses filled before they ever had to be touched. She sat across from him, a wealthy client with an easy smile and kind eyes, and for once she didn’t feel like she had to brace herself.

“Finally relaxing?” he asked, swirling his wine with a practiced flick. “You look lighter tonight.”

“I feel lighter tonight,” she admitted, surprising herself with the honesty. “It’s been, surprisingly, a good day.”

He lifted his glass in a small toast. “To good days, and better nights.”

She clinked her glass gently against his. The wine was smooth, the kind that tasted expensive even without knowing the label. He watched her with genuine curiosity, not hunger, not ownership. Just interest.

“So,” he said, leaning in slightly, elbows resting on the white tablecloth. “Tell me something real. What’s the plan after you’ve saved up? What do you want?”

She smiled, small, but real. “I want to open a little boutique. Clothing and accessories. Vintage stuff. Maybe even restore pieces… I’ve always loved the idea of giving things a second chance. A second life.”

“That sounds…lovely,” he said, and for a moment she believed he meant it.

“And you?” she asked.

He laughed. “I’m boring. My dreams came true too early, so now I’m stuck collecting hobbies.”

She chuckled softly, shaking her head. For a brief moment, everything felt normal. Safe.

Then he asked, “And how are things now? With… work?”

He said it carefully, respectfully, no judgment in his voice.

Something in her chest tightened. A small crack in her practiced calm.

“They’ve been… rough,” she admitted. “One guy turned into a creep. Really crossed a line. And sometimes my head just…”

She tapped her temple lightly with the rim of her wine glass, “…goes back there. To old stuff I thought I left behind. Makes me wonder if any of this…”

Her voice faltered.

“…if the future I want even matters.”

He nodded slowly, sympathy in his expression. For a second, she found comfort in it.

Then he smiled, soft, charming, but the words landed wrong.

“Well, dreams are sweet,” he said. “But people like us, like you… you’ve got to stay grounded.”

His tone stayed warm, but something beneath it shifted.

“I mean, it’s good to hope. Even if some of it is just… fantasy.”

Her stomach dipped.

He kept going, the charm still plastered on, unaware of the fault line he’d stepped over.

“You’re strong, but are you built for disappointment? Better to keep close to what you know. To who you know. Maybe, find someone who wants the best for you or knows what is, in fact, best for you.” His words punctuated with a calming smile. 

His image flickered, just for a breath, the well dressed, composed man across the table from her…then, the sneer of her ex, the same tilt of the head, the same cadence hovering beneath his words.

“Hell, you’re lucky I even bother with you”, the echo of her exes words rang in her skull, a frayed memory leaking into her reality.

Her breath stuttered. Her fingers went cold around the stem of her glass.

The client’s voice softened. “Are you alright?”

She blinked, realizing she hadn’t responded in several seconds.

“Could I…Will you excuse me. I need to use the restroom?” she whispered.

“Of course.” He stood when she stood with trained politeness, and she forced a small smile before turning away.

She walked toward the back hallway of the restaurant, the one leading to the restrooms. Her steps faltered just at the threshold.

The noise blurred. Her pulse thudded in her ears. Her ex’s voice, her client’s voice, the same shape, the same chill:

“You’ll be back. You always come back.”

Her chest tightened. Her breath hitched.

Instead of turning down the hallway, she pivoted hard and made for the front door, pushing out into the night air with a gasp as though breaching the surface of deep water.

She stumbled over to the wall of the restaurant outside the doorway, her back curling downward trying to catch her breath as new patrons were entering and old ones were leaving the restaurant. 

“Get it together,” she thought to herself. She knew that a woman looking like this, acting like this, always invited the unwanted attention, the unwanted questions, from a passer by or the pathetic ‘would be hero complex’ of a man who wants to live out the fantasy of saving the ‘damsel in distress’ when all she really wanted was to be left alone. 

She straightened, used the tips of both her pointer fingers to gently wipe away any resemblance of tears from her eyes before any damage could be done to her makeup. She pressed her dress, with palms flat, downward returning it to its crisp, firm, fit to her body look. Made sure her hair looked the part, stood tall and walked to the curb, with her practiced strength she learned long ago, hand already raised.

A cab screeched to a stop. She climbed inside and collapsed into the seat, slumping low as the driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror.

She turned her face toward the window, refusing to meet his eyes, refusing to acknowledge his curiousness, only to tell him where to go, and nothing more. 

The tears came silently at first, then harder, slipping down her cheek in messy hot streaks she couldn’t control.

The city lights blurred.

“You’re fine…” she said ever so softly between sobs and free flowing tears…”you’re fine.”

She wasn’t.

She barely made it through the apartment door before the feelings built up and cracked open inside her.

Her clutch hit the floor with a dull thud.

Her wig slipped from her fingers and landed beside it, a dark curl of someone else’s identity.

She tugged at the zipper of her dress, fumbling, almost tearing the fabric before she finally peeled herself out of it.

Bare, exhausted, unraveling.

She crawled into bed without turning on a light, burying herself beneath the blanket as her chest hitched and broke. Sobs shook her in shuddering waves until, slowly, mercifully, the sound of her own crying blurred into sleep.

Darkness folded around her.

She blinked, and suddenly she was standing in a hallway she knew too well, the apartment building.

Except…not her floor. Not any floor.

The corridor stretched on endlessly, warped by a dim amber glow that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. The walls breathed faintly, as though the whole hall had a pulse.

Every door was open.

And inside each one…her past waited.

She took a cautious step.

The floor creaked like an old memory complaining.

From the first doorway came a voice she hadn’t heard in weeks but still felt slick against her ears.

“…you stick with me, sweetheart, and I’ll make every dream you ever had come true…” She turned.

Her handler sat on a cheap motel bed, the version of her from years ago sitting beside him younger, scared, hopeful in ways she could hardly remember. He stroked her shoulder with a salesman’s assurance, his smile too wide, too practiced.

“You’re special,” he said. “But you need a man to guide you. I’ll build your future for you.” The younger her nodded, desperate for someone to believe in her.

She tore her eyes away.

A slap cracked through the hall.

She flinched and turned toward the next open door.

Her ex towered over a younger version of herself in that cramped apartment, rage twisting his features. His hand came down again, striking her cheek with rehearsed precision.

“This is your fault,” he snarled. “You always make me do this. You’re nothing without me. Nothing.”

The younger version of her sobbed, whispering apologies she didn’t owe.

Older her backed away from the doorway, stomach twisting.

She kept moving.

Soft music drifted from the next room, a skylit, top floor, opulent apartment with warm lights and a polished floor. The wealthy client held a version of her close, slow dancing, his hand on the small of her back.

“You know I could love you,” he murmured into her dream double’s ear. “If you’d just stop fighting it. Stop pretending you need anything other than me. Give yourself to me alone.”

As he said it, his face flickered, just for a second, into her ex’s sneer.

Into her handler’s wolfish smirk.

Into something hungry.

She stumbled back from the door like it burned her.

She moved faster now, walking past door after door, each one a different version of herself, a different man hovering above her, around her, in her space.

She broke into a run, feet slapping against the warped hallway floor, breath coming in jagged bursts as every open doorway spat another voice at her, not from one man, but from all of them, layered into a single monstrous echo. 

“Why do you make it so difficult to love you,” one hissed as she sprinted past. 

“It’s a good thing you’re pretty because you wouldn’t make it otherwise,” drifted from another room, soft as a lullaby. 

A colder voice followed, sliding beneath her ribs: “You’re such a baby, quit crying!” 

Then another, mocking and venom sweet: “You’re lucky anyone wants you at all.” 

She stumbled, catching herself on the wall just as a new voice prowled out of a doorway, slick and assured: “People don’t actually like you. They feel bad for you.” 

She jerked away, heart hammering, as more words spilled after her like hands grabbing at her ankles, 

“If you didn’t look like a whore, then maybe you wouldn’t be treated like one.”

“I wouldn’t hit you if you didn’t act the way you did, this is your fault!”

“It’s always something with you.”

“It’s like you’re trying to make it difficult to love you”

“No one would believe you anyways.”

Her vision blurred as tears welled, the voices melting into a merciless chorus that chased her down the corridor, each phrase hitting her like a blow, like a hand, like a memory she could never outrun.

And then, through tear filled blurred vision, she saw them. She slowed back into an exhausted trudging walk and wiped away the tears from her eyes staring at what lied in front of her. 

Three closed doors. Standing alone. Side by side. The only ones in the entire hall.

Her heart thudded.

She stood in front of the first door on the left, and opened it.

Inside sat her child self at a tiny desk, arranging dolls in a crooked little family. The room looked exactly as it had years ago. Pastel walls, soft lamp glow, the faint smell of crayons and carpet cleaner. A place that should have felt safe.

Her father stepped into the doorway with a careful quiet, like he didn’t want to scare a wild animal.

But he knew she wasn’t wild.

She was his.

He crossed the room slowly, each footfall gentle, almost rehearsed. His hands settled on her small shoulders with feather-light pressure, not enough to hurt, only enough to remind.

“There she is…” he murmured, voice warm as a blanket fresh from the dryer. “Daddy’s little homemaker. Playing family all on your own.”

She held up the dolls proudly. “I’m making them love each other.”

“Oh, I see that.” His smile deepened, soft and wrong in equal measure. “And you’re doing such a good job.”

He took the father doll from her with a deliberate slowness, letting his fingers brush hers longer than necessary. He leaned close, his cheek near her temple, breath warm against her ear.

“A home needs a strong man,” he whispered. “Someone who teaches his little girl how things fit together… so she grows up knowing how to keep everything from falling apart.”

He guided the father doll toward the mother doll, making them stand close,too close, and tapped their plastic hands together.

“See? That’s how my baby girl learns what love looks like. When someone patient shows her.”

Then, almost imperceptibly, he shifted the father doll away from the mother and toward the tiny child doll sitting untouched at the edge of the desk.

It wasn’t abrupt.

It wasn’t violent.

It was slow, smooth, like he wanted it to appear natural.

“But you also need to learn who you can trust,” he continued, voice dropping into a syrupy hum. “Who you should listen to. Who keeps you safe. Because the world is big…”

The father doll reached the child doll.

Tapped it once.

Rested there.

“…and little girls can get lost if they don’t have someone to guide them.”

Her younger self smiled, accepting the lesson without seeing the shape of it.

But the older her, the one trapped in the doorway, felt her breath catch in her chest.

Her father smoothed a lock of the child’s hair behind her ear with a slow, deliberate tenderness.

“That’s my sweet girl,” he said. “Always learning from her daddy. Always knowing where she belongs.”

And though every part of the woman she was screamed to look away, she couldn’t. Not yet.

The dream wasn’t done with her.

She closed the door quickly, in anger and shame as she slowly stepped to the door in the center. She opened it slowly with trepidation pulsing through her palm as it slowly turned the knob.

She was older here, early adolescence, hair laying softly against her shoulders, sitting at the same small desk with a wooden hairbrush clutched too tightly in her hand. Each stroke through her hair was slow and careful, as though she were trying not to make noise.

A quiet, timid ritual.

The door eased open behind her.

She tensed before she even saw him.

Her father stepped inside with that gentle tread she’d learned to fear, the one that meant he’d already made up his mind about something. A necklace dangled from his fingers, the pendant swaying like a hypnotic lure.

He smiled, warm and practiced.

“There you are,” he said softly. “My little lady.”

She swallowed, eyes dropping to her lap.

“Yes, Daddy,” she whispered, barely audible.

He approached the way someone approaches a skittish animal, slow, measured, knowing full well she wouldn’t run.

She never ran.

“I got you a gift,” he murmured, lifting the necklace so it glinted near her cheek. “Because you’re growing up so fast.”

She nodded quickly, too quickly, her voice small.

“Thank you… it’s pretty.”

Her fawn response. She knew what he wanted: softness, gratitude, obedience.

If she gave him that, maybe he’d be satisfied.

Maybe he’d leave.

He moved behind her chair, lowering the chain around her neck with deliberate care.

Her breath hitched, but she forced her shoulders to stay still.

The clasp clicked shut.

“There,” he whispered, his tone honey-sweet, almost tender. “Fits just right. Meant for you.”

She nodded again, eyes fixed on the mirror, avoiding his.

“Thank you,” she said, voice trembling despite her effort. “I… I love it.”

“Of course you do.”

His smile deepened, soft and wrong.

“I chose it. Daddy always knows what’s best.”

Her fingers twitched against the desktop.

Her reflection showed her chest rising too fast, too shallow.

He reached to brush a lock of hair behind her ear, slow, ceremonial, a gesture that made the older her watching from the doorway feel sick with remembered dread.

“You remember this necklace, sweetheart,” he murmured. “It’ll help you remember who you can count on. Who takes care of you. Who you belong with.”

Her younger self froze, then nodded again, quick and obedient, eyes shining with unshed tears she tried desperately to blink away.

“Good girl,” he whispered.

The older her felt that phrase like a punch to the ribs, the way it had always been used to bind her, to shrink her, to turn fear into obedience.

Shame welled in her chest, hot and immediate.

She shut the door before she broke.

The last door waited beside her, heavy as a held breath. Shame rose in her chest, the old kind, the kind she was forged from. The kind that taught her she deserved every wound she carried. She hesitated, not just afraid of what she’d see… but because she already knew.

She let the hesitation simmer before moving one step closer to the door, then opened it.

The last door opened onto her childhood room again, her late teen self was stuffing clothes into a backpack with frantic, uneven movements. Panic made her hands useless. Everything she touched slipped, fell, tangled. She kept wiping her face with her sleeve, tears streaking her cheeks like she was trying to erase herself.

On the bed sat her father, pale, shallow, sunken, trembling, his hands pressed to his face as if grief itself were a performance he’d rehearsed. When he finally looked up, his eyes were red and wild.

“You’re leaving me?” he choked, voice cracking into a whine. “After everything I’ve done for you? My love wasn’t enough?”

She didn’t answer, she didn’t dare. She just kept packing, shoulders hunched against the sound of him.

He reached for her, fingers shaking. “You’ll never make it out there!” he cried. “Not without me. You hear me? Not without me.”

She froze at that.

The older her, watching from the doorway, she could see it:

the fawn instinct, the fear, the old lessons in obedience warring with the part of her that wanted to be free.

Her teenage self turned slowly, tears brimming.

“Please,” she whispered. “Just stop.”

That’s when he unleashed the words, the ones that would burrow into her bones and echo through every relationship that followed.

“You’re weak,” he snarled.

“No one will look after you.”

“No one will want you.”

“You’re lucky you have me.”

“You’ll come crawling back.”

“You always will.”

Each sentence hit her younger self like a physical blow, her shoulders tightening, breath hitching, her entire body folding around the shame he had spent years feeding her. He leaned forward, voice deepening with venom.

“Go on, run. You’ll be back. You can’t survive without me.”

The teenage girl broke.

With a trembling hand, she ripped the necklace from her throat, the chain snapping with a soft metallic gasp. She threw it into his lap, sobbing harder than she had in her life.

His face twisted from grief into something sharper, uglier.

“That’s it,” he spat. “Throw away the only good thing you ever had.

You’ll see what you are out there.”

Her younger self bolted out the bedroom door, out of the frame, out of that life.

The father figure stayed seated.

Then, slowly, like something inhuman, he turned his head toward the doorway where the older her stood. His eyes locked onto hers.

“You,” he whispered, voice suddenly calm.

“Are you still Daddy’s girl?”

Her breath snapped in her chest. She felt herself collapse backward, hitting the floor as her footing abandoned her. He rose to his feet.

But he didn’t walk.

He unfolded, taller than he had any right to be. The room around him darkened. The walls swallowing their own color, corners dissolving into oily black. His voice shifted, dropping into a register that didn’t belong in a human throat.

“You ran from me,” it said, layered and wrong.

“You became exactly what I told you you’d become.”

“Look at you. Weak. Lost. Nothing.”

She crawled backward across the hallway floor, palms slipping against the trembling boards as the corridor warped around her.

Her father, no, not her father anymore, this thing, this gross amalgamation of a nightmarish creature that only held some vague grotesque details of her father…stepped into the doorway and the doorframe bent to let it through, as if the building itself feared him.

Its arms elongated unnaturally, fingers stretching until they scraped the hallway wall beside her head with a thunderous crack.

She screamed, at first with fear, but then the fear subsided and she screamed with something else behind it, a rage, a hatred, the kind that had been growing inside her for years.

“You did this to me!” she shouted through tears. “You ruined me! You…”

It snapped toward her, the shadow of the head jerking with a violence that made reality ripple.

“Ruined?” It thundered, voice deep and echoing, a hundred tones layered into one monstrous sound.

“Not ruined…made. 

I…made…you.”

She pressed back against the wall of the dream corridor, trembling uncontrollably as he, it, lurched closer. It opened its frothing maw and spoke to her in the growl of a long lived predator.

“You can never leave me. I am always here. You ran away from a man, a house, a life. I am more. I am more than the tangibility of those insignificant relics. I am your pain, your guilt, your shame, your fear, I am the creeping doubt that guided you to every choice you have ever and will ever make in your life. I am the dread you feel lurking in the dark corners of your little hideous thoughts that pull you back to what you fail to escape, no matter how far you run. No. You will never be free of me. No matter how hard you try or what corner of this earth or your mind you try to escape to, I won’t  stop, will not let go, will never leave.”

The gaunt horrifying creature leaned in closer trapping her terrified gaze into its hollow eyes, “You are mine.”

“Always…now…forever.”

Its warped hand clamped onto her face, not hurting, but claiming, trapping her in the shape of its shadow.

She screamed into its tightening grasp, a raw, ripping sound and the dream shattered like glass exploding outward.

She shot upright in bed with a violent gasp, the scream still tearing from her throat as tears streamed downward.

Her hands flew to her face, to her cheeks, to her jaw, as if trying to wipe away the imprint of something that never touched her skin but had scarred her all the same.

She curled into herself beneath the thin blanket, rocking in the dim wash of the streetlight. Her voice shook as she whispered, “You’re fine… you’re fine…” but the words were empty now, stripped of anything that could save her. 

The door she opened in her dream had shown her a hurt she’d buried so deep she forgot it had teeth. And now that it was awake, it closed around her like a cell. She felt it, the walls of her past tightening, the lock sliding into place. There was no key. No way back out. The cage that her past trauma built was complete, and the woman she had fought to become was trapped inside it, with nowhere left to run.

“You’re fine… you’re fine…”

Her voice cracked thinner with each repetition, the last whisper warping, fraying, turning into an echo that wasn’t just hers, spilling out along with her own voice. 

“…you’re fine…”

A long, terrible pause.

The voice, his voice, soft, pleased, unmistakable. Spoken from her but not by her. 

“…you’re fine.”

“There are places that do not forget.

And there are tenants who mistake silence for forgiveness.

In 4A, the truth was never buried—only stored.

Waiting for the moment it could no longer be avoided.

By the time she understood this, the apartment was already full.

Her name appeared in the ledger without ceremony, without error.

The building did not claim her.

It simply made room.”",1,1766110396.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

I told my friend about it, and she connected me with her colleague that she knows work at that specific company within that same region. I reached out and set up a 30 min coffee chat to learn more about his (28M) work experience. After meeting virtually, I thanked him and offered to treat him out to coffee through text. After a few months, he reached out to check in on my new job but my hire date did not start till a few months later. Fast forward to a few months later, I reached out to him for that coffee chat. Unfortunately, our work schedules did not align so instead of coffee during the day we decided to grab dinner after work. I treated him out for dinner which he did not expect bc he also ordered desert after his meal. After the dinner, he thanked me and we shook hands before we left. He then texted me saying thank you and that he wishes he did not live so far. The week after- he texted me how my week was so far and asked if I was free that day for dinner. He chose a restaurant from the initial list of restaurant options I sent for the first dinner hangout. Of note, the restaurant was a bit pricier, and the vibe was elegant with dimmed lights all around. Throughout the dinner, I noticed he would make comments like “next time” or “I’m having a great time”. To me, I honestly had a great time with him, and we would laugh a lot. We talked about work, past life experiences, hobbies, interest, etc. At the end, he let me walk down the stairs first and also scanned my body from bottom up after we hugged goodbye. At the moment, I felt subconscious but looking back he might've checked me out? I’m not sure what this second hangout meant. I’m interested but I also don't want to initiate another hangout if it was purely just friends. After the second hangout, I texted him briefly saying thank you and that I'll have to reach out to him next time when I'm near his area and that was it. He'll be traveling out of state to visit family for 2 weeks, so I can't reach out until the new years for another hangout even if I wanted to.

First order was much fresher; this one arrived about 2 months post-roast. The site advertises freshly roasted, so I emailed them. This is part of their response:

 “I can understand that you were surprised at first that the roast was already two months old. However, this is not a quality defect in high-quality roasted coffee, but is often even advantageous. Here are a few reasons why your coffee is reaching its full potential right now:

Degassing: Freshly roasted beans still contain a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2). This must escape in the first 2 to 3 weeks after roasting. If the coffee were too young, the gas would hinder extraction during brewing and often result in a slightly metallic or unpleasant sour taste. After two months, this process is perfectly complete.

Aroma development: Similar to a good wine, many coffee varieties only develop their complex flavor profile after a certain resting period. The aromas settle and the mouthfeel becomes more harmonious.

Optimal storage: Since our bags are equipped with special aroma protection valves, the beans are protected from oxygen. In the unopened package, the freshness is almost completely preserved for many months.”

1pq8vlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1pq8vlj/do_printondemand_marketplaces_still_work_as/,Do print-on-demand marketplaces still work as passive income?,"Honest question for the sub.

I’ve been thinking about passive income models that are actually low maintenance, not the usual Shopify + ads + daily ops setup. More like asset-based income where you create something once and let a third party handle everything else.

So I tried a print-on-demand marketplace.

I uploaded a t-shirt design to Sticker Mule’s marketplace and that was it. They handle printing, payments, shipping, and customer support. After the upload, there’s nothing else to do. No inventory, no fulfillment, no customer interaction.

As a quick validation test, I shared the listing once with friends and it sold around 20 units in a day. No follow-ups, no ongoing work. That got me thinking less about the initial sales and more about whether a listing like this can continue selling over time without intervention.

That’s the part I’m interested in going into 2025–2026. Not trying to get rich, just testing whether these marketplace-based, set-it-and-forget-it models still have legs as a form of passive income.

I’m treating it as an experiment right now, not a business.

Curious to hear from people here who’ve tested similar things:

* Have you seen marketplace POD listings generate ongoing sales after the initial setup?
* Do these platforms still bring organic traffic, or is it mostly dead without ads?
* Are there better marketplaces than Sticker Mule for this kind of asset-driven approach?

If anyone’s curious about the brand behind the experiment (coffee + merch), here’s the site: [https://perro.cafe]()

So it's been like half a year, or a bit more. I (18) was talking with my grandma in the kitchen while she was cooking something. we live just outside the city, so my aunt often drops off my little cousins on the weekends so that we can supervise them (she and uncle work most weekends) and they can get fresh air and stuff. that weekend my youngest cousin (3) was visiting. so we were making light talk, and my cousin was bothering us like little kids do. at some point he asked to pour him some water. grandma gave him some, but he didn't like the cup, or something, either way he asked again and grandma got busy with the cooking so I took over. the nearest cup was my dad's favourite mug. I filled it, gave it to my cousin, and he dropped it. our floors are stone tiled, and the mug was ceramic, so it immideatly shattered. I panicked, but I have a habit of holding in big feelings until I'm alone to let them out. some time later dad (49) came to the kitchen and I told him we broke the cup. he jokes a lot at home, and that time he joked too; he made an exxageratingly sad face and said he was sad in a joking manner, so I know he doesn't really care. he's got other mugs that he likes as well.   
  
it's just that, i know it was his favourite. he picked it more often than his other mugs, and it was the oldest mug we had in our house. I think he said it was around 25 years old? so it's older than even my parents' marriage. it had a picture of some Budapest bridge on it, and the word Budapest written on it, like, the whole picture of a souvenir mug. my granparents brought it for him from their hungary trip. also, I few months after that we visited my parent's hometown for some family event, and we went over to my uncle's (on dad's side) house, and he took out the very same mug!! turns out they bought it in a pair!! I was already sad and guilty about it, but after that trip I was even more sad and guilty. 

I know my dad doesn't care about stuff like this. like, he lets me take his old clothes, and use his things, and stuff. he doesn't even like getting souvenirs, or being gifted souvenirs (he complains about it when uncle brings him over stuff from his holiday trips). And I know I'm sentimental, I like giving meaning to material things like that, but if I was in my dad's shoes, I wouldn't be as upset as I am in my shoes in this situation. if that makes sense. like I would be sad but i know they didn't mean it so i would forgive them pretty quickly.

and it's important that it's a mug, because. cultural context. we drink black tea after every big meal, and as it's own meal (with snacks or sweets) and just for fun really. it's a big habit thing in our culture. a lot of people do coffee instead, but then again, you would need to have a mug to drink it at home. so everyone has their own mug, often multiple. the entire reason why I think so much about this is because we obviously drink the tea at the end whenever we as a family get to gather together for a meal and I can see him taking out some other mug.  
then again, I wouldn't care so much if it was my mug that was broken. I would just go and by a new one that I like. 

so why do I feel so guilty about it?? how do I stop?? 

I thought about talking with him about it, but I'm really scared. I think he will most likely say that it's okay and try to wrap it up quickly, cause he doesn't like to talk about his feelings with anyone other than mom. and then I would still worry over it. If I press, there's a big chance he'll just say I'm being weird and worrying too much and that's just gonna make me spiral (I have a problem about stuff like this). so I'm kinda stuck in a limbo.  I don't usually get so worked up about small everyday things like this, so I don't know what to do here.

I had a GI appointment lined up for a few months to discuss some long ago diagnosed gastritis. Was supposed to be just a quick consultation.

In the meantime, noticed blood in my stool. Ofc. It was super small and occasional. Not on tp, not in the water, just like a small red spot on the stool, sometimes. So we got the colonoscopy scheduled. I was EXTREMELY nervous. I have severe health anxiety and the idea of waking up to bad news my stomach sinking.

This sub helped. A lot. The positive stories and encouragement and tips were so soothing and empowering. I shifted my focus to taking charge of my health, regardless of the outcome, instead of ""what if"". I was still scared, but not spiraling.

My prep experience was SIGNIFICANTLY better than I had mentally prepared for. That's not to say it was fun, but honestly, regular old diarrhea is a much worse experience than my prep poop experience was.



I'll explain everything I did and how it went, just in case I owe my ease of experience to the steps I took.



For 4 days straight, leading up to liquids day, I did the low residue diet everyone talks about. (Again, thanks to this sub).

I'm also a vegetarian and currently not eating gluten, so pickings were a little slim. I ate greek yogurt, (maple syrup to sweeten things like yogurt) smooth peanut butter, applesauce, boiled apples, boiled potatoes, cooked mushrooms, eggs, and white rice. I drank water and black coffee. I didn't switch to decaf coffee, although I saw one online list say coffee and tea should be decaf. Oh well, I wasn't giving up that one simple pleasure.

The diet wasn't awful, but I wouldn't have wanted to do it much longer. 

On day 5 (day before colonoscopy) I had my morning coffee before 9am, then onto the liquid diet. I drank water, tea, Gatorade, and white cranberry juice. I alternated types of liquid per the instructions. I never had anything solid like Jell-O or gummy bears, mainly because I didn't have any on hand. I was hungry. Duh. But I kept busy and distracted. For one day, not a big deal.

5pm I drank the first dose of Clenpiq. I drank it pretty fast but didn't chug it.

It was not yummy.

It wasn't as bad as I'd heard.

It's a sickly sweet taste, like you can tell it's masking the real taste, which I only got with the aftertaste. 

I followed that with lots of fluids (was instructed to do at least 5 8oz drinks of clear fluids after 1st dose, before 5 hours were over. Did that and more).

Around this point, I applied a little aquafor to my booty hole, as a precaution. 

No movement until 2.5 hours later.

It wasn't very uncomfortable, like no major cramps. Just an obvious urge all the sudden, ever so slightly painful. Everything was liquid. Weird. Actually kind of cool.

I stayed in the bathroom for a while and had to go 3 times, with 16 minutes in-between. Kept applying aquafor after.

Got up for a while and had one more go before bed, around 10:30.

Slept fine, tummy-wise (my 2 year old decided to have a sleepless night, however, so I did, too). 

Nothing in the morning until less than 2 hours after my 8:30am dose of Clenpiq (after which I drank a lot more fluid and took GasEx, as instructed).

At that point, each time really was like peeing from my butt. Especially the last few times, it was light yellow. Sooo weird, but nice to know it's all getting cleared out.

I did go twice more after arriving at the facility, but I was early for my appointment and it was barely anything by then.

Altogether, I only had to go 11 times TOTAL, and the final times were almost nothing. Oh, and not once did I experience the burning raw feeling I'd heard so much about. 

The procedure:

Quick questionnaire and then changed into grown. They put a warmed blanket on me after I laid down.

Prepped for iv and wheeled into the room. 

Once in the room, met anesthesiologist, nurse, and dr (again). They went over everything to expect. I had a chance to ask any questions. 

It was actually an endoscopy+colonoscopy, so they put the bite thingie in my mouth for the endoscopy part, administered the anesthesia. Felt tingly in my face and was out like a light.  

Next thing I knew, they were saying my name to wake me up and I was back in the prep room. 

Suddenly, through blurry eyes I saw my doctor and she said the findings:

""We did find a large polyp... Something something precancerous... Went well... Something something ... another colonoscopy in 3 years...."" Then went to leave.

I was like WHAT. WAIT. Gestured for her to come back, probably looked like a pathetic child because I felt woozy and emotional, but I wanted more information. They said she had another patient but would be right back. And then I was hiding my eyes under my blanket and crying. A really awesome, kind, nurse came in and asked if I was ok, if I wanted to go over the results. 

Then I really broke down, maybe because she was being nice, but also because I'd had so much anxiety leading up to this point and didn't get the ""all clear"" I was hoping for. And definitely because of the drugs, too.  She was great, said she totally understood. If she was lying, I still appreciated her.

She reassured me that it looks like precancer, not cancer. And said results will be in soon, before Christmas (thank God, because that was one of my worries with this timing). And that it just means I need more frequent colonoscopies than we thought.

The dr did come back and reassure me as well.

So. Alllll that to say.

Not what I was hoping, but. Not actually bad news. And I'm SO. GLAD. I DID THIS.

If I hadn't been spooked by a LITTLE bloody stool here and there, I wouldn't have said anything to my GI Dr and who knows what would have happened between now and my 45 year old screening (that's 10 years from now).

And the prep, plus ease of the actual procedure, and the fact that there WAS something that needed to be removed, makes me feel so grateful, despite my nerves upon waking up. 

Finally, nurses really are angels. Professional angels. ",4,1766109128.0,colonoscopy,2,1.0,False

He bday falls close to xmas and I am not wealthy, we just get by, so many years he doesn't get a full party. This year felt like a big milestone becoming a teenager so I wanted to make it special. We invited 10 kids and rented out some batting cages for 1.5 hours, I ordered a cake and planned a whole game and food and snacks. We live in an apartment so I planned a scavenger hunt outside to keep them entertained after the batting cages and wanted the prize to be soem hidden money. So on Monday I pulled out $20 and got 4 5 dollar bills. Today is Thursday and his last day of school before break  they were having a party at school and so I pulled a $5 out of my wallet and handed it to him and saw the other 3 $5s. I work from home so went to my room to go back to work, while in there I heard his friend come inside for 5 minutes before they left together.  A little after thay I walk out to get more coffee and I notice that both my purse and wallet are open, which is not like me, so I go and look and see if only have 1 $5 in my purse. I immediately call my son asking if he took $10 which he denies. I say we'll if you didnt take it then your friend must of and he says no. I feel like I should add that i dont think his friend took the money, he has been in my house lots before and nothing has ever gone missing. My son was with me when I pulled out the money at the store and knew what I had and where it was. My son has also never stolen money but does sneak extra snacks and cookies and lies a lot about little things and his lying has been an issue for a while now and sadly i have caught his lying so much i dont believe him much. My son's refuses to say what happened and how the money disappeared, they were the only 2 in the living room and I 100% saw it when I handed him the $5. When he got home we tried to talk about it but he still says he didnt do it and neither did his friend. So I told him that I his bday was cancelled as I feel like he is lying and I do not trust people in the apartment if he has no clue what happened to my money. A part of me feels like I am overreacting over $10 but I feel like if my son did take and I let him still have a party I am setting an example that he can just steal more next time. So AITA?

Overall, I really enjoyed cyber sleuth. After finishing time strangers, I wanted to play more Digimon. So, I decided to play cyber sleuth. This game really blew me away with the side quests and how fun the story was. Yeah, the game isn’t going to win awards, but damn was it fun to go through. Some of the characters are great especially Kyoko. Her coffee can take down any Digimon. No contest! Jokes aside. Makes me excited to go through hacker’s memory in the future. 

Game was just comfy to go through. Kinda of needed that comfy game I won’t lie. Yeah, the dungeons are very repetitive. Can be boring to look at. I don’t mind the memory system since it made me have to think about what Digimon to use or when to evolve. There were times I wish I could use certain Digimon stages with a full team, but it wasn’t a big deal. Felt like if im using too much memory for my 8 man team then it’s not needed at the moment. Training was fine to me. Not much to comment on. Did wish I could buy out the training like in TS. Though again, minor complaint. The dedigivolving was not as needed as I thought. Only needed to really do it maybe twice for some Digimon like crusadermon. ABI isn’t as bad when you get the means to grind. Was also another good teller of I shouldn’t digivolve yet. Too much dialog was an issue. Times I wish I could mash through it all since it felt like there was talking for the sake of it. 

Not much else to say, but I had a great time and I love to hear what other people think of cyber sleuth. What was your favorite part of the game and what was your Digimon team? Heck, who was your mvp on the team? Love to read what other people think of this title. Can’t wait to get into hacker’s memory someday and see why others love it so much.

And yes, before anyone asks, this was based on a Smiling Critters fan episode.

Anyways, here's the plot: The episode starts with Batric sneaking into Andy's lab to steal some gadgets for his schemes. But before Batric can leave with the gadgets, Nono (who volunteered to be a night watchman at Andy's lab) spots him, and tries to stop him. But during the struggle, Batric and Nono bump into a shelf, which causes Andy's latest prototype gadgets to land on their heads - those being Mind-Swapper Caps. When Batric wakes up, he quickly realizes that he and Nono switched bodies, and says, ""WELL THAT'S JUUUST... Totally the best!!!"". Batric (now in Nono's body) continues his excitement, saying, ""Now that I'm in Nono's body, I can cause all sorts of chaos, and nobody will think it's actually me!!! Cause I'm sure not going to tell them I switched bodies!!! Later, loser!!!"", and flees the lab, leaving the gadgets behind. Nono (now in Batric's body) wakes up, realizes the situation, and says, ""Not good."". Later, Andy enters his lab, only to find some of his gadgets in a bag, a broken window, and Nono is nowhere to be found. Andy then sees Batric (Nono) frantically looking for the Mind-Swapper Caps, while Andy thinks, ""Hmm... Batric may be a troublemaker, but he would NEVER stick around in my lab until I arrive! I'm sure someone must be wrong!!!"". When Andy approaches Batric (Nono), he tells him, panicking, ""Andy!!! Thank goodness you're here!!! Batric and I switched bodies, and I don't know how to switch back!!!!"". Andy tells Batric (Nono) that first they need to find the Mind-Swapper Caps, then they'll figure out what to do next. Meanwhile, Nono (Batric) is walking through the park, when she decides to lure Sadny Bin to the old saw mill. Nono (Batric) successfully lures Sadny Bin to the old saw mill, and once there, she ties him to a log with chains, and gags him with a red cloth. Nono (Batric) then says to Sadny Bin, ""How about you see what it's like to be SAWED IN HALF!!!!"", and activates the conveyer belt, while Sadny Bin shouts muffled cries for help. Back at Andy's lab, Andy and Batric (Nono) have found the Mind-Swapper Caps, and Andy tells Batric (Nono) that the only thing powerful enough to destroy the Mind-Swapper Caps is fire. Batric (Nono) says to Andy, ""You do NOT have to tell me twice!!!"", and tosses the Mind-Swapper Caps into the furnace. As the Mind-Swapper Caps melt, the body swap reverses, causing Batric and Nono to return to their normal selfs. Nono, now back in her body, quickly notices Sadny Bin's peril, and turns off the conveyer belt, just before the log reaches the saw. Nono unties Sadny Bin, and apologizes for what she did. Back at Andy's lab, Batric, now back in his body, says, ""Aw man... I was having fun!!!"", to which Andy replies, ""Hope you enjoyed it while it lasted! Now, kindly leave my lab before I call the police."". Batric flees, and Andy says, ""Now that that's over with, I need some coffee."". The episode ends with Nono and Sadny Bin leaving the old saw mill, and Sadny Bin asking Nono, ""Why were you acting so strange today?"", to which Nono replies, ""It's a long story."".

That's all, have a nice day. :)

Soon after, Juliette is given the news that her kingdom is on the brink of bankruptcy.

**Chapter 460: Mirror, Mirror**

“Ohohoho! Behold, Coppelia! … My bedroom!”

“Gasp … are we finally here?”

Covering her mouth in feigned shock, Coppelia eyed the rarest gift I could offer.

The sight of my bedroom … and also an impromptu ballet display.

That’s right!

Current princess task–*spinning in delight*!

I pirouetted on my heels again and again, all the while my smile filled up Coppelia’s vision until she needed to lean to the side just to admire the same surroundings as me.

It was … wonderful!

The gentle, pastel coloured walls! The open windows with the fluttering curtains! The carpets as soft as my cheeks! The bookshelves gleaming with embossed spines! The wardrobes bulging with all the immaculate dresses now several days out of season and therefore was only good as kindling!

And nowhere did I see a single loose sock!

“Ohohohoho! We’re … we’re finally here! After all this time … I’ve finally returned!”

I spun around several more times, stopping only when I started seeing multiple Coppelias also spinning around me. 

She efficiently took in every detail. 

Particularly the area beneath my bed.

… To my delight, there were no socks there either!

Everything was just as clean, tidy and organised as I remembered!

I didn’t expect very many changes, of course. Even the slightest nudge of a flower pot needed my permission. But that still didn’t change my joy at seeing the proof that I’d defeated every explosion. 

Indeed, while my soul hadn’t come away unscathed, my room was perfectly pristine.

In fact, there was only one notable difference.

“Roll, roll, roll\~”

Yes.

A certain clockwork doll immediately doing what she was clearly going to do everywhere.

“E-Excuse me! Please do not roll on my bed!”

“It’s soooooooooooooooooo soft! I’m trying to climb out and I can’t! This is *amazing*!”

“Coppelia!!”

It mattered little whether it was the Winter Queen’s bed or my own. 

She showed as little mercy for the dignity of both.

While squishing the pillows that would now need to be replaced, Coppelia went from spinning to rolling. Like a loose sack on a ship, she lurched to and fro, testing even the impossible sturdiness of the duvet tucked beneath the edges of the mattress.  

Against such vandalism, I did what any princess would do.

“The same rules apply,” I declared, as I mysteriously found myself lightly rolling beside her. “This is my side. That is yours. The dividing line cannot be breached.”

“Heheheh … so soft and fluffy … it’s like I’m being swallowed up by a cloud of swans again …”

On one hand, I was appalled. Only I was allowed to dishevel my bed. 

On the other, I was pleased she was so overjoyed that she’d begun hallucinating things which never happened. *Probably*.

“10/10,” I said with a nod, confirming what I’d already known. “Better than the Winter Queen’s bed.”

Ohohohoho!

Indeed! 

Mine might not have self-regulating temperature control, the permanent fragrance of a spring meadow or the unyielding texture of snow … but it was still better!

It was a bed chosen by myself, and its warmth was one where I could fall asleep as easily as I could read, write or flop around in the long hours of the night.

I smiled as I caught a glimpse of the balcony.

The last time I was here, I’d been pacing between the wardrobe and the mirror while the moonlight had flooded inside. Now it was the warmth of the afternoon instead, flowing past the curtains while also bathing the gnarled oak tree outside.

A gnarled oak tree … which also seemed to be sprouting oranges.

Hmmmmmmm.

My smile dipped slightly as I tilted my head in confusion. After all, I knew enough about trees to know that oaks couldn’t grow oranges.

For a moment, I considered this puzzling and somewhat worrying development.

And then–

*Nothing*.

I tossed the thought out of my mind.

Ohohohohoho!

Indeed, there was time to fill my head with worries later! 

For now, all I had to do was bask in the moment!

There were still things to do, of course. And all of them to do with visiting Clarise. I had no doubt she’d suffered as the only princess in my absence. I needed to offer my gratitude for all the mandatory tea parties she had avoided on my behalf.

*Achoo*.

… However, given that I could practically hear her sneezing from her observatory, I needed to ensure I didn’t make her feel any worse than she already was.

Thus, all traces of mud needed to be removed!

Rolling to my side, I peeked at a door deliberately left slightly ajar. A gentle waft of steam was teasing its way past, accompanied by the faint scent of lavender and eucalyptus. 

My smile brightened even further.

While the standards of the new hires had clearly gone downhill, the ability of the veteran maids to prepare for my return had not.

I rolled to face Coppelia. She could no longer be seen amidst a crushing mountain of pillows.

“Coppelia,” I said, my brows knitted in seriousness. “I hope you know what needs to be done next.”

She thought for a moment, then lifted her head just enough to glance over me.

“Is it time?” she asked, eyes blinking.

“It’s time.”

She sat up and nodded.

A few minutes later–

*Pwoooosh*.

The sound of a princess sized bathtub being disturbed echoed throughout the Royal Villa.

As the fragrant water imbued with an unbreakable layer of bubbles welcomed us into its warmth, I instantly relaxed as all the memories of the things I didn’t do hurried away. 

“Ahhhhh …”

Somewhere, the heavens were raising their fists in envy.

Here in a bathtub large enough to swim in, there were no caves, dungeons, mines or receptionists to haunt my nightmares. 

I took in a deep breath and let out an even deeper sigh. 

Then, I adjusted myself to begin floating, all the while the bubbles barely moved around me.

“*Blub blub blub blub blub*\~”

This was despite Coppelia enjoying herself to the fullest.

Like a duck experiencing her very first pond, she paddled from end to end, spinning, tumbling and at several moments looking as if she might be drowning. 

However, after several seconds where only the top of her golden hair could be seen, she suddenly rose again, a bright smile upon her reddened face.

“Oooh … this is great\~! I didn’t expect to feel so nostalgic … !”

“Hmm?” I idly lifted a foot, unable to stop myself from floating away. “What’s nostalgic?”

“Well, I figured that every time you talked about how big your bath was, it was only big in the normal way. But this is like being back in the workshop.”

“The workshop … oh, yes, it’s also a bathhouse, isn’t it?”

“Mmh. It’s sort of like this. But even *bigger*.”

I was shocked.

“Excuse me? … Do you mean to say that you’re accustomed to swimming and frolicking in even more decadent pools of water than this one?”

“Yup. This is still a 10/10. But the workshop is an 11/10. You should definitely visit and hope it hasn’t relocated again. You’ll *love* it. There are even automated scent dispensers.”

“Automated what now?”

“Yup. Herbs and flowers and salts just come sprinkling down from the ceiling. You can even mix and match your own with these giant levers. Once you’re done, you can pull another lever and it all drains away. It’s really convenient.”

I gasped.

Why, to think that such an advanced bathing apparatus was available in Ouzelia! And that I had just barely managed to miss it while I was there!

“H-How appalling! Had I known such a magical contraption existed, I would have gone to greater efforts to find this mysterious workshop while I still had a dragon to abuse!”

“Ahahaha\~ well, it’s not really something you find. It’s more something you come across.”

“That is terrible! How will I ever copy your bathhouse inventions if it’s hidden in such a way? Is the design something you can replicate? Perhaps … Perhaps using the library budget?”

“Nope, it’s a mystery even to me. But I’m sure you’ll get a chance to see it. If you ask nicely, the old guy might tell you how it all works, too. You just need to bribe him with his favourite coffee beans.”

“I … I shall make it happen!”

“A looooot of coffee beans. He’s in demand, so it takes a bunch to get his attention.”

I wiped the bubbles from my face to show my earnestness.

“This is a matter of national significance. I’ll begin stockpiling coffee beans at once.”

Coppelia giggled as she swirled like a mermaid. 

I didn’t join her. This was serious. As someone who intended to create the largest public bathhouse on the continent, I needed the most advanced infrastructure to facilitate it as well.

But like all things … that could also wait until tomorrow. And maybe the day after as well.

Today, I’d be doing nothing but relaxing!

*Knock knock*.

Especially since this was my sanctuary. 

And that meant  not even a polite set of knocking on the door could trouble me.

“I am busy,” I said towards the disturbance. “Please return later.” 

My mind clearing immediately, I smiled as I sunk the back of my head into the cradling waters.

*Knock knock*.

… Just not enough to drown out the sound of the gentle rapping.

Once was normal. Twice was a firing.

“Yes … ?” I called out. “What is it? I’m currently preoccupied for the next decade. If there’s an urgent problem only I can deal with, please inform a steward.”

*Knock knock*.

I was bewildered.

Twice was ghastly. But a third time was unprecedented.

Nobody knocked three times. Not even the harbinger of doom. And she couldn’t possibly have found her way into my own home. That was absurd.

… Right?

I pursed my lips.

All of a sudden, the temperature of the bath started to increase as my sweat added to it.

It only lowered again as the door parted and a smiling maid peeked inside.

“Oh? My apologies for the disturbance, Your Highness. I couldn’t hear very well through the door. I have fresh tea and carrot cake from the kitchens. Shall I leave it beside the bed?”

The maid blinked against a cloud of steam.

However, despite the haze obscuring her face, her smile still shone like the sunlight. 

This was curious.

Up until now, the harbinger’s smile was the only one that had ever given me any reason to pause … and yet it turned out there was one even more deserving of my attention.

Not because it was frightening. 

But rather, it was the most beautiful I had ever seen.

Radiant and dazzling, here was the smile of a fair maiden who had never known the sight of an unflattering reflection.

After all–

It was the same smile as mine.

verse 1
Driving home late at night fingers locked ever so tight
You asked me what I thinking I just smiled
Years of memories on our side the thought of losing you crosssed my mind

Kids gone away and grandkids out in the yard
This one really hit me hard

No one talks about or asks about the hard thoughts, this one is the worst
What if god takes you first?

chorus
Leave a light on in heaven for us
Keep dinner on the stove I won’t fuss
Just like when I worked late
You know I’d never miss a dinner date
If you go first, life will be
Rough
But I’ll be home soon enough

Verse 2
I’ll tell everyone about our first date
And how we stayed out way too late
Kisses at mid night on New Year’s Eve
But not what we did between those sheets

I’ll tell them about your shrimp and grits and the holiday treats you made were the best

Chorus
Leave a light on in heaven for us
Keep dinner on the stove I won’t fuss
Just like when I worked late
You know I’d never miss a dinner date
If you go first, life will be
Rough
But I’ll be home soon enough

Verse 3
I’ll keep your robe hanging by the door
Your coffee cup on the shelf like before
I’ll talk to you like you’re still right here
Pretend your laughter’s what I still hear

Bridge 
And when the nights get long, and the house feels cold
I’ll crawl in our bed, feel the space you once stole
I’ll pray a little harder, love a little more
Till the day I see your smile at heaven’s door

Verse 4
I’m not sure what I’ll do, maybe mow the yard a time or two
I’ll stare at the stars every night thankful for the day we reunite
A life of laughter and love is hard to forget
I hope you know how much it meant

Outro
Leave a light on in heaven for us
Keep dinner on the stove I won’t fuss
I’ll finish my time here, do what I must
Till I’m back with you—
In the God we trust
If you go first, life will be
Rough…
But I’ll be home soon enough",2,1766107293.0,Songwriters,3,1.0,False

The manager said that they run the micromarket, and budget for a loss every month, but make about $800 profit. I don’t have any pictures or information about how filled it is to capacity yet, and how many residents. 

There are 2 clear fridges, a decent snack & drink mix, and some frozen items like eggo waffles and frozen pizzas. They also have apartment convenience Amentity section, about 12-15 feet of shelf space and a few floating shelf’s on top of that. 

The place is brand new and immaculate. Right near downtown of my city of 65,000 and commuter rail. There is a tiny coffee and sandwich shop across the street that is for sale.

The manager said that the boss wants to make a decision soon and is looking over a couples  

bids from vending companies. I told them I’d do everything for free and give them a revenue share.

My next step is to go in and gather the info I need tomorrow, such as how many residents, growth projection, etc, Take pictures (I’ll post here). I’ll also tell him we should probably skip the revenue share, as the Amentity for the upper middle class residents with better prices would be better off than a few hundred dollars a month. I’m sure they would rather fill their $3,000-5,000 capacity to 100%. 

I currently have no machines, no footprint, no job, and no money, however I have a couple 401ks with over 6 figures and 2 homes I still owe a lot of money on. I’ll have all my credit card debt erased and vehicles paid off in late January, when my wife cashes in on her work stock options after the company sold. TYJ! 

I’ve been laid off twice this year, and am going all in on this business and make it as modern and successful as I can. I am also getting positive vibes from my two local YMCAs. I am a dad of 4, coach, and athlete so I understand what our community would like in these machines. I have a solid business plan to scale.  

I’ve heard mixed reviews about apartments. Asking the community - Should I go all in, and how would I grow this apartment to 5,000-10,000+ revenue?

Thanks,

It feels like I’m crawling in a sewer of angst and sweaty palms and dizzy spells. All the tunnel vision looks the same. I lose hours to finding entertainment in puddles aglow of my own reflection, narcissus is the muse in the mirror of all my deflections.

Escapism is a thief of joy time hope.

i always clock back into reality

how’s your mileage? I’ve gone far out. touched galaxies as I slept away heartache, but not even swimming in the stars will keep me from burning my tongue on my coffee as a weekly occurrence
