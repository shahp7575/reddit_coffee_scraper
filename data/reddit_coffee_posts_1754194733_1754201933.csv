So I’m 42, loving life, and finally admitting to myself that I miss real, easygoing friendships—especially the kind where we can laugh at weird life stuff over coffee or wine (or protein shakes, if you're a fellow gym rat 🏋️‍♀️).

My main hobbies:
🏋️‍♀️ Gym—because therapy is expensive and dumbbells don’t judge
🏖️ Swimming—bonus points if the water's not freezing
✈️ Travel—I don’t always know where I’m going, but I pack like I do

Now here’s the kicker: I recently found out that some of my lovely (and very traditional) family members have apparently had to do a bit of... damage control? Because of me?? 🤷‍♀️
To be fair, I do have strong opinions, travel solo, speak up at dinner, and—okay fine—apparently I look like the kind of woman that makes aunties clutch their pearls. I didn’t get the memo that existing confidently was controversial 😂

So—ladies, have you ever found out that your vibe (or face, or outfit, or entire existence) made things a little too interesting at family functions?
And gents—have you got a sister/cousin/friend who gives off “Why is she wearing that?” energy and you had to stand there awkwardly while your relatives whispered?

If any of this rings a bell (or made you laugh), let’s talk. Women friends especially welcome (because we just get it), but respectful guys are cool too.

Let’s connect! I'm always up for good convos, gym sessions, travel planning, or laughing at how weird being an adult still is 😄

1mgc314,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flins_Mains/comments/1mgc314/his_premium_team_is_literally_just_one_extra_5star/,His premium team is literally just one extra 5star😭,"Look, I 100% completely understand not wanting to pull for a support character you don't like because of design (it's giving Acheronmains but nevermind that). 

But I think the real issue is the citlali/mavuika or more closely, the skirk/escoffier banner timing. Ineffa releasing just one patch before flins sucks, but that doesn't mean i'm just not gonna get her eventually. I also main mavuika so I had to skip citlali's first banner then got her in her rerun that's out now, and I did the same for neuv skipping furina to get him first then her on the rerun, that's kinda what I'm gonna do with Flins and ineffa is nothing changes drastically.

But I think we need to put into perspective just how CHEAP and STRONG his current best team is, literally one additional cost.

- Mavuika: 2 additional cost
- Neuv: 3 additional cost
- Arle: 2 additional cost
- Skirk: 3 additional cost
- Lauma: 2 additional cost

Only really Varesa matches him in cost and dps which is VERY GOOD. I don't think people realise just how lucky we are that he's cheap as hell and still strong, whereas other current top teirs need 2 more 5stars to complete their teams.

Now ofc this could change as get someone like columbina who'll likely increase his team cost but that could put him on a level higher than current dps' (that is if Bina doesn't buff them do which I doubt lol)

It's your account so do whatever you want but I'll just say that the dps/character you want is priority because pf banner timing and primo management and THEN go for ineffa,

 again i understand not wanting to get back to back 5 stars, but i don't really have a problem with ineffa's design🤷🏾‍♂️, I'm gonna be looking at flins the whole time anyway, and it's not like she's a dedicated support in the way that she's tied to the hip with flinns, she's still very strong on her own and is an overall buff to your account too

I guess I'm just trying to say that I don't understand the crash out at all, like it's really not that deep, Kinich mains didn't have this kinda reaction during his leaks phase with Emilie, mavuika mains we're only mad about the banner timing, the only justified crash just should've been skirk mains cuz they had terrible banners timing AND was tied to the hip with coffee while also need furina/yelan as the minimum yet their crash wasn't to this extent. 

I just don't want to see us become another wannabe clone of Acheron mains, that sub during the chaos was actually peak entertainment, the memes were legendary and global, but we aren't gonna replicate that here, it's just gonna wnd up being toxic, unfun and miserable ",1,1754201785.0,Flins_Mains,0,1.0,False

Person 1:  didn't show up drunk, but no chemistry, was mean, I should have just left.  but it was my first date in 20 years, so I didn't know any better.  Still - how should I have left?  Just said ""uh, this isn't working, so I'm going to go home"" and then call it a day?  This one left me feeling used and just... really shitty about myself.

Person 2:  showed up drunk, was kinda funny at dinner watching the shitshow play out, etc.  after dinner, asked me to stop at a liquor store, lost her purse at the restaurant so I purchased her 12 pack, then went back to get her purse with her, etc.  went on a pro-trump rant around 2 minutes from the end.  afterwords, I'm just like ""why did I waste 3 hours and a couple hundred bucks""?  I guess it's a wild story to tell, so kinda worth it, but hot damn.

To be clear, a number of dates in-between these, that have gone well, very well, and total disasters (my own fault).  I'm trying not to be picky and instead just trying to get out there to get into the swing of things again (43/m, so being picky isn't an option really anyway), but holy shit - it's wild out there.  and I REALLY want to get my rebound feelings out of the way so I can make something work out with dream girl (if you read my previous mega-rant that got mod-deleted).

Anyway, my question:  What's the best way to leave these dates?  Is it just like...  get up and go?  I want to be polite, so I feel like I should say something and not just run out the back door.  But then I'm afraid of some sort of escalation/blow-up, so I don't say anything, and just smile through it.  Am I just planning these wrong and instead I need to just meet for a drink/coffee/walk first, and then go to dinner on a second date?

1mgby57,https://www.reddit.com/r/cxfuture/comments/1mgby57/the_psychology_of_waiting_how_companies_turn/,The Psychology of Waiting: How Companies Turn Frustration into Positive Experiences,"We've all been there - stuck on hold listening to terrible music, standing in an endless line, or watching a loading bar that seems frozen. But some companies have figured out how to make waiting actually... bearable? Here's the psychology behind it.

##Why Waiting Feels Worse Than It Actually Is

**Occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time.** Ever notice how a 5-minute wait with nothing to do feels like forever, but 15 minutes scrolling your phone flies by? Companies use this by:

- **Phone systems:** Playing interesting content instead of generic hold music. Some airlines share travel tips or destination info
- **Physical locations:** Mirrors in elevators (you check yourself out), interactive displays in waiting areas, or even simple magazines
- **Online:** Loading screens with tips, fun facts, or mini-games instead of blank progress bars

**Uncertain waits feel longer than known waits.** Not knowing if you'll wait 2 minutes or 20 is anxiety-inducing. Smart companies combat this with:

- **Online:** ""Your order will be processed in 2-3 minutes"" or ""You are #5 in queue""
- **In-store:** Digital boards showing current wait times or ticket systems with estimated times
- **Medical offices:** Apps that let you track your position in line and tell you when to head over

## The Power of Explanation and Rewards

**Unexplained waits are more frustrating than explained ones.** A simple ""Due to high call volume..."" or ""We take extra time with each customer to ensure quality service"" makes people more patient.

**Small rewards can flip the entire experience.** A discount code, free coffee in the waiting area, or even just a sincere apology can turn irritation into appreciation.

## The Peak-End Rule Changes Everything

Here's the kicker: People judge experiences mainly by how they felt at the peak moment and at the end. A long wait can be completely forgiven if the service afterwards is exceptional.

When that customer service rep finally picks up and is genuinely helpful, apologizes for the wait, and solves your problem efficiently? Suddenly the whole experience feels positive.

## Real-World Examples That Work

- **Disney:** Makes queue waiting part of the experience with themed decorations and entertainment
- **Domino's:** Pizza tracker that turns waiting into anticipation
- **Some banks:** Offer free coffee and comfortable seating, making the wait feel like a brief rest

## The Bottom Line

Companies that understand waiting psychology don't just reduce frustration - they can actually increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. The future isn't necessarily about eliminating all wait times, but transforming them from necessary evils into opportunities to surprise and delight customers.

Waiting sucks, but smart companies use psychology to make it suck less (or even be pleasant) through entertainment, transparency, explanations, small rewards, and killer service after the wait.

I started my medication yesterday, Inspiral 10 mg (2 times a day). Not much changed, but my focus improved, and I still got a little distracted. It was not anything like what some people describe. It felt normal, not magical. 

I read a lot of posts on Reddit where people said 10 mg did not do much for them and they switched to 20 mg.

So today I thought I would try taking two pills, making it 20 mg as I have an important exam tomorrow and I have barely studied( ADHD paralysis) But yesterday I was able to revise a bit, so I thought maybe 20 mg would help give me that boost and help me do better.

But, an hour after taking it, my heart feels a bit racy and my brain feels blank. The background noise in my head is gone completely. It is kind of nice but I feel way too excited. I know you are not supposed to feel like that. I also know it was probably stupid to try this.

An example or two would be how we don’t spend as much time hanging out or chatting it up. 

If Im being honest, I do have some resentment towards her for the way our relationship has been going recently. It’s not really justified because she didn’t ask to be so busy all the time or as if she malice intent when canceling plans. On the bright side, we have scheduled to hang out later this week to try a new drink at a coffee place.

But..Im going to secretly try it by myself without her first. I know it sounds dramatic but I think it could something good for me. After idolizing her and forgetting to see her human side, I’ve been disappointed by her so much. Im not too sure how to explain it, other than a way of getting even?

## Key features analysis

The current market offers a wide array of privacy screens, each with its own set of features and benefits. Evaluating these features is crucial in selecting the privacy screen that best meets your needs.

**Privacy Technology:** The core function of a privacy screen lies in its ability to restrict the viewing angle, typically to around 60 degrees. Advanced privacy screens utilize micro-louver technology, embedding tiny vertical blinds within the screen protector to block light from angles outside the direct view.This ensures that only the person directly in front of the iPhone can clearly see the content on the screen. The effectiveness of this technology depends on the density and precision of the micro-louvers.

**Material Quality and Durability:** Premium privacy screens are crafted from tempered glass, renowned for its extraordinary hardness and scratch resistance.This material provides a robust barrier against everyday wear and tear, protecting your iPhone's screen from scratches, scuffs, and even minor impacts. Look for screens with a hardness rating of 9H, indicating superior resistance to scratches from common objects like keys and coins.

**Screen Clarity and Touch Sensitivity:** While privacy screens excel at concealing your display from onlookers,it's crucial that they do not significantly compromise screen clarity and touch sensitivity. The best privacy screens utilize advanced coatings and manufacturing processes to minimize distortion and maintain optimal image quality. Furthermore, they should be thin enough to ensure that touch sensitivity remains unaffected, allowing for smooth and responsive interaction with your iPhone.

**Installation and adhesion:** The ease of installation is a important factor for many users. Privacy screens that come with an alignment frame make the request process simpler and more precise,ensuring a bubble-free installation. Moreover, the quality of the adhesive is critical to maintaining a secure and long-lasting bond between the screen protector and your iPhone's display. Look for screens that use high-quality adhesives that leave no residue upon removal.

**Additional Features:** Some privacy screens offer additional features such as anti-glare coatings, which reduce reflections and improve visibility in brightly lit environments. Others may incorporate blue light filtering technology, which helps to minimize eye strain during prolonged use. Some even include antimicrobial coatings to inhibit the growth of bacteria on the screen surface.

Key features to consider:

*   micro-louver technology for effective privacy.
*   9H hardness rating for scratch resistance.
*   High clarity and touch responsiveness.
*   easy installation with alignment frame.
*   Anti-glare and blue light filtering options.

## Core Benefits

Privacy screens offer a range of benefits that extend beyond simply preventing visual eavesdropping.These advantages contribute to a more secure, comfortable, and productive mobile experience.

**Enhanced Data security:** The primary benefit of a privacy screen is the added layer of security it provides for your personal and professional data. Whether you're checking your bank balance,reading confidential documents,or composing sensitive emails,a privacy screen ensures that this information remains visible only to you. This is especially vital in public places such as coffee shops, airports, and public transportation, were prying eyes are more prevalent.

**Reduced Visual Distractions:** Beyond safeguarding privacy, these screens can also help minimize visual distractions. By restricting the viewing angle, they reduce the likelihood of nearby individuals glancing at your screen and possibly diverting your attention. This can be particularly beneficial in busy environments where focus is paramount.

**Improved Comfort and Confidence:** knowing that your private information is shielded from onlookers can significantly enhance your comfort and confidence when using your iPhone in public. This peace of mind allows you to navigate your digital life without constantly worrying about who might be watching.

**Eye Strain Reduction:** Many privacy screens incorporate blue light filters, which can help reduce eye strain and fatigue caused by prolonged exposure to the blue light emitted by digital devices. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals who spend extended periods using their iPhones, such as students, professionals, and avid gamers.

**Protection Against Scratches and Damage:** Along with their privacy features, these screens also serve as a robust barrier against scratches, scuffs, and minor impacts. This helps to preserve the pristine condition of your iPhone's display, protecting your investment and maintaining its resale value.

## FAQs Section

Understanding the common questions surrounding privacy screens is essential for making an informed purchase.here are some frequently asked questions and their answers.

**Do privacy screens significantly reduce screen brightness?**
While privacy screens inherently reduce screen brightness to some extent due to the privacy layer, modern privacy screens are designed to minimize this impact. Many feature advanced coatings that optimize light transmission,ensuring that the screen remains reasonably bright and clear when viewed directly. Users can also adjust their iPhone's brightness settings to compensate for any perceived dimming.

**Are privacy screens compatible with Face ID?**
Yes, most privacy screens are designed to be fully compatible with Face ID.the cutout for the front-facing camera and sensors is precisely engineered to ensure that Face ID functionality is not affected. However, it's always recommended to check the product specifications to confirm compatibility before making a purchase.

**How do I clean a privacy screen?**
Cleaning a privacy screen is similar to cleaning a regular screen protector. Use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently wipe away any dust, fingerprints, or smudges. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the privacy layer or the screen coating. If necessary, you can dampen the cloth with a small amount of water or a screen cleaning solution specifically designed for electronic devices.

**Will a privacy screen affect the clarity of my photos and videos?**
High-quality privacy screens are engineered to minimize any impact on image quality. While there might be a slight reduction in brightness or contrast,the effect is typically negligible for most users. However, lower-quality privacy screens may introduce noticeable distortion or blurring, so it's important to choose a reputable brand known for its clarity and optical performance.

1mgbn88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1mgbn88/guess_at_brand_new_day_plot/,Guess at Brand New Day plot,"So with the confirmed characters (hulk, punisher, scorpion, Ned, MJ) and rumored (Mr. Negative) I have a guess at what the plot will entail. 

Movie starts with Peter navigating his new life as the unknown Peter Parker. New suit, has been Spider-Man for the past two (or five) years, well known around the city. Peter probably works as a freelancer for the daily bugle. Occasionally visits MJ and Ned at the coffee stand but only as a regular customer without getting too close to them. 
Things kick the plot off by Mr. Negative (assuming he’s the main villain) has his goons causing trouble for whatever his motivations will be. This trouble leads to punisher getting involved, perhaps running into Spider-Man at a smaller conflict. If they take some inspiration from the PS4 Spider-Man story, perhaps the goons give Spidey and punisher a taste of his powers, basically sending him into a mental spiral of his traumas (Tony, aunt May, green goblin, punishers family, etc). The two interact, possibly have a minor scuffle (with the goons getting away in the process), before parting ways. 

Hulk gets thrown into the mix when Mr negative puts hulk in a mental spiral as well for whatever reason the plot demands (I’m assuming to cause chaos/a distraction while Mr negative gets a separate task done, similar to what happened in Age Of Ultron), undoing his ego as Professor Hulk and splitting them back into hulk and Bruce. This causes hulk to take over and cause utter pandemonium, forcing Spider-Man and punisher to get involved as they all fight each other. 
Once things calm down and hulk is back to Bruce again, the three talk about what’s going on and who may be causing everything. 
Plot details and exposition is given before figuring out Mr negative is the one causing it. But they’re still pretty shaken up by the mental chaos that Mr. Negative inflicted on the three, leading to Peter looking for a place to unwind and think things through. No better place than the coffee shop with MJ and Ned (they’re not particularly close, still friendly and as close as one can get with a regular customer). Peter seeks counsel from them, they have an emotional moment together and Pete gets his thoughts together before devising a plan on his own. 

Mr negative makes his big move for the plot, punisher and Spider-Man team up to defeat them with Bruce hanging back and providing support from afar as Bruce being directly there has a considerable risk of bringing out the hulk again. They defeat Mr negative (punisher either killing or attempting to kill Mr negative with Spider-Man intervening) and some emotional arcs are completed (Peter getting over his traumas, punisher either has something similar or goes down a darker path) while Bruce goes back to the lab to figure out how to merge hulk and Bruce back together again. 

Post credits reveal the symbiotic getting closer to Peter, and the second one putting up one more teaser for Avengers Doomsday. 

World breaker hulk I’m assuming they’re saving for doomsday or secret wars, same with the symbiote suit. Scorpion will be present in the movie no doubt but I’m guessing it’s as a secondary villain working under Mr. Negative that does cause some of the skirmishes throughout the movie. 

It’s just my guess with the confirmed and rumored cast. Probably not the best written plot guess but hey the MCU isn’t exactly Hitchcock levels of unpredictable writing nowadays.

When I got this, it was mainly to try out Ingenious Ginger and Bohemian Lime. I was sure I was going to love those two. 

- INGENIOUS GINGER (ginger, mandarine) - This is a zesty ginger floral. I was hoping I’d like this as I love ginger and it did not disappoint . 4.5/5

- BOHEMIAN LIME (lime, coriander, vetiver) - This one was disappointing as I thought I’d love it based on the notes - but it smells like men’s shaving cream. 1.5/5

- SUNSET HOUR (peach, raspberry, ginger, vanilla) - This is a delicious juicy zingy peach cocktail, love at first sniff. 5/5

- PACIFIC ROCK MOSS (moss, lemon, sage) - Another love at first sniff. Getting a lot of geranium, the moss is grassy not dirty. It’s sweeter than I expected. 5/5

- SOUTHERN BLOOM (boronia, jasmine, iris) - Love boronia but really dislike jasmine, sadly I don’t get the boronia in this at all, and the jasmine is the star. Doesn’t feel heady to me like most jasmine dominant scents do though. 1.5/5

- WHITE SANDALWOOD (sandalwood, thyme) - really get the thyme and saffron here. A dry aromatic woodsy scent. 3/5

- VELVET SPLENDOUR (jasmine, mimosa, tonka) - Was expecting to really dislike this but I very much like it. It is white floral dominant, how am I enjoying this? It’s got some pepper or spice to it I’m picking up on. Shocked I like this. 3.5/5

- WOOD INFUSION (exotic woods, lavender) - Lavender and citrus straight off the bat, it’s like Tam Dao with added aromatics. 3.5/5

- DESERT ROSEWOOD (rosewood, mandarine, cardamom) - juicy mandarine, warm cardamom, this is fantastic. Something really nostalgic about this that I can’t pinpoint. It’s actually making me a bit sad, like I am mourning an antique piece of furniture. 3.5/5

- BLUE CYPRESS (blue cypress, clove, star anise) - Ooh this is tasty. It’s aromatic, aquatic, and a bit minty. This is another standout. 4/5

I feel like I was harsher rating these than usual because there were SO many great ones, so a lot of those 3.5’s are pushing 4’s. If this was on a scale of 10, more than half of these are 8 and above. Usually I might love just one in a discovery pack, and dislike at least a third. This was just full of fantastic, well, discoveries. 

Recap: Have bought Sunset Hour, Pacific Rock Moss & Ingenious Ginger since sampling them, and Blue Cypress is on my wishlist. 

Love: Sunset Hour, Pacific Rock Moss, Ingenious Ginger, Blue Cypress
Like: Velvet Splendour. Wood Infusion, Desert Rosewood
Use sample and forget: White Sandalwood
Give away: Bohemian Lime, Southern Bloom


RECREATION

I got this looking forward to the two that contain fig (Undone & Sun-Kissed). Considering the discovery kit is only $54AUD and it comes with a $20AUD voucher towards a full bottle, it’s a pretty good value kit 

- UNDONE (fig, spice, amber) - green, bitter, spicy, woody. 3.5/5

- CALL ME VENUS (oud, rose, vetiver) - I wasn’t expecting to like this as I’m iffy on oud and vetiver. An earthy rose and oakmoss, saffron spicing it up, sandalwood for some creaminess. 3/5

- AT NIGHT WE DANCE (musky, spicy floral) - thyme, lavender, clove and soft florals. Has a nice woody base, it’s a very aromatic and spicy floral, but there is a slight mustiness holding this back for me. 2.5/5

- JOYEUX (tuberose, jasmine, peony) - I’m not a fan of jasmine or tuberose so I wasn’t expecting to like this, and I was right. A big ole white floral bomb. 1/5

- LOST IN DUSK (vanilla, spices, coffee) - Yep definitely get the coffee and vanilla. But of plum in there. Just sweet enough to offset the bitterness of the coffee, this is really nicely balanced. 4/5

- THIS LOVE OF MINE (gardenia, jasmine) - Again wasn’t expecting to like this, it’s white floral dominant. There’s some basil and I’m getting a pear smell (not a listed note), I feel like if the white florals were replaced with rose or iris or lilac I wound love this. But alas, 1.5/5

- STARDUST (lemon, thyme, geranium, sandalwood) - Thought I’d love but it’s quite forgettable. Aromatic, citrus, woody. 2.5/5

- SUN-KISSED (fig, pear, lemon myrtle, jasmine). - Loving the lemon myrtle and pear and fig, unfortunately that jasmine isn’t hidden enough for me to forgive. It’s useable, but damn I would love this if it weren’t for the jasmine. 2.5/5

- L’HOTEL (rose, peony, vanilla) - There was a sample in the package outside of the discovery pack, called L’Hotel. No notes listed for it and I couldn’t find it on their site. I give it a smell and it was an immediate WOW. A deep dark vanilla, rose and peony, soft warm woody musky base but never dusty. I loved this enough that I emailed them and asked them about this sample, they said it was an unreleased perfume that was being launched in a couple weeks. So I kept checking back, and then bought a full bottle of this the day it came out. 5/5 

Recap:
Love: L’Hotel
Like: Undone, Lost In Dusk 
Like, but wouldn’t buy: Call Me Venus
Use sample then forget: At Night We Dance, Stardust, Sun-Kissed
Give away: Joyeux, This Love Of Mine 


JULIETTE HAS A GUN

I got this pack as a free reward from a place I buy stuff from regularly - I’ll admit I wouldn’t have bought this myself. I smelled Not A Perfume a while ago, and couldn’t smell anything, so was kind of looking forward to trying this out again to see if there was just something wrong with the tester bottle I tried.

- NOT A PERFUME (cetalox) - There was nothing wrong with the tester. It appears I am completely anosmic to this. How can I even rate something I can’t smell? Like this: 0/5

- EX VETIVER (lemon, vetiver) - I’m getting a feint whiff of vetiver and lemon. I like what I can smell, but it’s so weak I’m wondering if my anosmia extends for base base DNA throughout all their fragrances. 1.5/5 

- LUST FOR SUN (ylang ylang, coconut, vanilla) - Ok I can smell this at a regular perfume strength. It’s like a tropical sunscreen, I don’t really enjoy sunscreen scents but I appreciate how accurate this is. I see a lot of requests for sunscreen scents and if that’s you, then this is worth checking out. 2.5/5

- VANILLA VIBES (vanilla, salt, musk) - I can barely smell this. I’m getting the slightest suggestion of vanilla. 1.5/5

- MIAMI SHAKE (whipped cream and strawberry) - I am sure I will hate this as I have never met a laconic scent I enjoy. I spray. I sniff. This is like a strawberry milkshake bubble bath you use to coax your water averse dirty little 4 year old child into the bath. It’s extremely childish and unsophisticated. I really like it. 4.5/5

- ODE TO DULLNESS (star anise, sandalwood, tonka) - Excited for this as I love star anise. Instead all I get is a generic shaving cream smell. 1/5

- PEAR INC (pear, musk) - The pear here is fresh and crisp, but once again, this is just weak. I’ve done farts that last longer than this. 2.5/5

- LADY VENGEANCE (rose, patchouli, vanilla) - This reminds me of On A Date by Maison Margiela. A very jammy rose. I like it. 3.5/5


Recap: I immediately bought a travel size of Miami Shake after sampling this. 
Love: Miami Shake
Like: Lady Vengeance 
Use sample then forget: Lust For Sun, Pear Inc
Steeped in mediocrity, give away: Not A Perfume, Ex Vetiver, Vanilla Vibes, Ode To Dullness

1mgbdjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1mgbdjc/my_neighbor_had_a_full_meltdown_after_i_posted_a/,My neighbor had a full meltdown after I posted a ‘no trespassing sign’ and removed his ladder from my property.,"I’ve  now had some issues with neighbors on all three sides of me encroaching, storing stuff and dumping on my property. I’ve handled two of them, one was super nice about it the other is a complete jerk, but they are off my property. But interaction went sideways. 

My neighbor has rented the house next door for 10y and I purchased my home 8m ago. The renter is constantly deploying a ladder coming off the shed about 3’ into my yard. There is no reason  to keep a deployed ladder on my property to access his shed roof. It’s liability and a hazard. Meanwhile, he has complained about me cleaning up my property while dumping yard debris onto it.   He complains about my dog and keeps coming near the fence. Just keeps coming on to my yard for no reason.

Friday morning I came off a ruff shift at work and the ladder was in my yard again. I took it down and put up a no trespassing sign.

Saturday morning at about 7:30 the renter is tearing up my flower bed and throwing the plants and pavers over the fence. He stops when I ask him to and curses me out. I get some coffee, take the dog walk, take photos of the damage. I sat down around 9 to message his landlord when the renter starts setting off fireworks! I reported it to the landlord and went about my day- the advice from my boyfriend (who is out of state) was to wait for the landlord my brother advised me to go to the police.

At 2pm I hadn’t heard back from the landlord and considered filing a non-emergency report, but found out would need to wait until Monday to do so. 

At 3:30 the landlord messages me that he will talk to his tenant and he would be checking in with me when he got off work.

4pm I’m outside playing with my dog when the neighbor starts cursing at me because I reported him to his landlord. He sets off more fire works and pulled his car to where he had torn up the flowerbed and blasting music. I have to admit, it was like watching a train wreck, I couldn’t look away from it- he was going from one bizarre activity to the next in pretty rapid succession. I did not engage- FaceTimed my boyfriend to show him, took a video and reported everything in real time to the landlord via text and photos.

I figured the best thing would be to get out of there (I was getting a bit scared at this point). I went two doors down to a neighbors house, he’s retired and lives with aging parents. He is friendly with this renter said it was out of character and figured there might be something deeper to go nuts like this and checked in on him about 30m later while I waited with his parents at his house. When he came back he let me know that he was still there blasting music in his car, but appeared calm. I asked if calling the police would escalate or defuse the situation and he thought it may amplify it and I should continue checking in with his landlord. I hung out with my dog, the neighbor and his aging parents for about an hour and a half more (they are fun neighbors and we had a good time chatting and they put my mind at ease).

At about 7:30pm my neighbor walked me home, stayed for a bit to just make sure the renter was gone and did not come back. The landlord has not contacted me back after his tenant’s blow up and I will follow up with the police tomorrow morning.

Our sex life followed suit snd plummeted. 

But a strange this has happened. I had decided to just hang in there with the church…putting on the happy face, still attending. And I actually slowly started to maybe not fully come back. I was no longer holding all that bitterness. Call it more of a crossroads than a crisis perhaps. 

Meanwhile my wife…funny enough…started to become more nuanced. Grateful she was released from her calling, trying coffee, not wearing garments as dutiful. 

The funny thing is…this has led to a sexual awakening for us both. Catching her in actual panties, skipping church to stay in bed, taking a few short trips to hotels, things like that. 

We are not in danger of completely going inactive or resigning. But we have also decided to perhaps live a little less letter of the law. And this has put us back on a better wavelength. And call it what you will but the sex has gotten ramped up these last few weeks.

I still got on flight even though they weren’t at the airport. 

Long version - 

This past week I was presented with an industry award in Nashville that an agency partner nominated me for. I am a Director at my company. My Co decided to send two junior-level employees to the event as well because they thought it would be a good experience for them - a Specialist who has been with us a little over a year (25f, first job out of college) and a summer intern (21f, rising senior). They are not on my team (report up through separate VP) and I have very limited / no interaction with them in daily work life. 

They were VERY excited to be going. This was going to be the Specialist’s first time on a plane, lots of Teams chats asking what to wear, etc. We were flying in Thursday morning and leaving Friday evening so it was a very short trip, but I tried to help share info about the event (types of attendees, awards reception/presentation Thursday night with a country western theme, then I was speaking on a panel Friday morning). 

There’s so much I could say, but I’ll try to highlight key points: 

- Specialist barely made Thursday AM flight because she doesn’t have a Real ID and had to do extra screening. She had no idea what a Real ID was, or the basic rules of flying (liquid restrictions, etc.) She was VERY upset they made her throw away some of her skincare that was over 3oz. 

- Thurs night event was country western theme, and while a majority of people there were business casual, Intern shows up in a bandana tube top, micro skirt, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. I pulled her aside and asked if she wanted to run upstairs and change since it was still a business event, but she said she was fine and she thought she looked cute and on-theme.

- After ceremony I invite them to join me with some colleagues I knew from other Companies in the hotel bar, but they tell me they want to “check out Broadway”. I make a face and say this would be a good networking opportunity, they make “c’mon mom” jokes, and so I tell them to be safe and remind them the time and location of first session the next day. 

- Text them around 11pm that I hope they got back safe, no response. Went to bed. Text them the next morning offering to meet them for coffee before morning sessions, no response. 

- No idea if they actually attended any sessions or saw my panel, but I did find them in the hotel lobby afterward looking incredibly hungover. 

- Have about 2 hours after event is over and before we need to go to the airport, I invite them to late lunch with our agency partners. They decline because they want to go to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Again, make a face and say I don’t know if they will have time and I think it would be a good opportunity for them to spend time with our agency. They act like I’m the wet blanket so I tell them I’m leaving for airport from the hotel at 4pm sharp and meet me in lobby so we can share a Lyft.

- Text them at 3:45pm that Lyft is arriving in 15 mins, no response. 

- Text them that Lyft has arrived and I’m leaving for airport, no response. 

- Text them when I get to airport and tell them security line is long (neither had pre-check), no response. 

- Text them when I get to gate to please give me some sign of life, Intern sends very short response about 10 mins later: “In Lyft, there’s traffic.” Nothing else. 

- Text them flight is starting to board, no response. 

- Text them when I’m in my seat that boarding is about to end, no response.  

- Doors close, they don’t make it, put my phone in airplane mode. 

Land a couple hours later to a barrage of texts from them. They’re “stranded in Nashville”, don’t know what to do, how to rebook, who to call for help, etc. I also have an angry voicemail from Specialist’s mom that I “abandoned her daughter in Nashville”, she has never flown and has anxiety, she’s having a panic attack at the airport and needs medical attention, she could be human trafficked (???). I call Specialist and Intern back, both phones ring but neither pick up. Text to see if they were able to rebook, no response. Forward them email with our business travel info with after-hours contact and text them that I sent the email, no response. Texted an hour or so later to see if they were okay, no response. Did not call the mom back. 

Also have text from their Director (don’t know her well, just started with Co a couple weeks ago) asking what’s going on. I send her brief overview and screenshots of all my unanswered texts to them from earlier in the day along with the transcript of the vm I got from the mom. She acknowledges my response, but no further dialogue. 

Now, I get an invite for a Monday morning meeting from that Director with their VP and our C-Suite leader. My VP is on PTO. 

I feel like these are adults, I was communicative, and I’m ultimately not responsible for their decisions. But you tell me, AITA here?

there are bunches of places where coffee is grown. many of the south american countries have their own grounds, some of which are better than others. colombian is typical for your average starbucks or mcdonalds. it's quite the hot commodity, and difficult to produce due to the fickle nature of the coffee plant. it needs very specific conditions to grow, and colombia specifically have made themselves a mass exporter, which in part brings down the quality. as a coffee snob, my nose wrinkles at the smell of starbucks coffee (though not so much so i wont drink if :). addict first, snob second, no offense to any starbucks lovers). in general, i consider south american coffee to be so-so.

next is african coffee. african coffee is grown in, you guessed it, central africa. one of the coffee shops i frequent gets their coffee from ethiopia. it can be quite good, in my opinion a pretty big step up from most of the south american grinds. it's smooth, not particularly bitter as far as coffee goes, and goes well in lattes, specifically with cinnamon or honey.

indian and indonesian coffee are the odd ones out here. to my knowledge ive never tried indian coffee. india is the new kid on the block, recently budding their coffee industry with top down programs like subsidies. indonesia on the other hand is the ninth largest exporter of coffee. indonesian coffee ive only had on occasion. i think it's rich and flavorful.

finally, vietnamese coffee. thailand as well. vietnamese coffee is my favorite by far, and has a special process by which you can make it: the phin drip. i have one at home. vietnamese coffee is exceptionally strong, earthy, and bitter but it's very smooth because the plants are seeded in very high nitrogen environments. tastes best straight, or in sugary drinks with heavy cream, caramels, the works. 

so what makes good coffee? good coffee in my opinion balanced bitterness and taste. a bitter coffee should have a more subtle and full taste, and a less bitter coffee can have a sharper taste that appears moreso in the foreground. it's hard to describe im sorry :). anyway, regardless of taste profile, coffee needs to be grown in a nitrogen rich environment. you can taste when a coffee plant was grown in truly great soil. if not, the coffee will be bitter and taste flat. ofc theres more to the taste profile but it's a little difficult to set up general categories. i explain it best when i have a cup in my hand. hopefully this is of some help for my up and coming connoisseurs.

hope you enjoyed, until next time!!!!! ",8,1754199023.0,LuckyStarSFW,0,1.0,False

Look at this! Zorbeez attracts liquid like a magnet! It doesn’t matter if it’s coffee, soda, even red wine!
Watch as this powerful vacuum action pulls and cleans the stain from out of the carpet – just that quick.

## Key Features Analysis

The leading veneer whitening toothpastes offer a range of features tailored for the unique needs of veneers.

**Gentle Abrasives:**
 
These toothpastes typically utilize hydrated silica or similar gentle abrasives in fine, controlled particle sizes. Unlike regular toothpaste with coarser abrasives, these formulas effectively remove surface stains and plaque without scratching or damaging the delicate surface of veneers. The particle size is often measured in RDA (Relative Dentin Abrasivity) scores, with veneer-safe toothpastes generally having an RDA below 70.

**Fluoride Protection:**

Fluoride is a critical component for maintaining overall oral health, including the health of the natural tooth structure supporting your veneers. top-rated veneer whitening toothpastes include an optimal fluoride concentration (typically around 1000-1450 ppm) to promote remineralization,prevent cavities and protect the margins where the veneer meets the natural tooth. This helps prevent decay and keeps those edges looking nice.

**Non-Abrasive Polishing Agents:**

Many advanced formulas incorporate specific polishing agents like tetrasodium pyrophosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate, which gently lift stains and brighten veneers without harsh scrubbing.These ingredients help to maintain the smooth surface of the veneers, preventing future stain buildup and enhancing the natural-looking shine.

**pH-Balanced Formula:**

A neutral pH level is crucial for protecting veneers. Highly acidic toothpastes can etch composite materials or weaken the bonding agents holding the veneers in place. Leading veneer whitening toothpastes are carefully formulated with a balanced pH (around 7.0) to prevent any damage and maintain the integrity of the veneers.

**Stain Prevention Technology:**

Some toothpastes include special polymers that create a protective barrier on the surface of veneers, preventing stains from adhering. This technology is particularly beneficial for individuals who consume stain-causing foods and beverages like coffee, tea, or red wine. The coating helps to keep your veneers looking bright and white for longer periods.

**Ingredients for Gum Health:**

Healthy gums are essential for the longevity and aesthetics of veneers. Some toothpastes contain ingredients like aloe vera, vitamin E, or xylitol, which promote gum health and reduce inflammation. These additions contribute to an overall healthier smile,enhancing the appearance of veneers.

Key features of the best veneer whitening toothpastes include:

*   Low abrasivity (RDA <70)
*   Fluoride for cavity protection
*   Polishing agents for stain removal
*   pH-balanced formula
*   Stain prevention technology
*   Ingredients for gum health

## Core Benefits

Veneer whitening toothpaste offers several key benefits distinct from regular toothpaste, especially important for those with cosmetic dental work.

**Maintains Veneer Colour and Shine:** Veneers can lose their luster over time due to staining and microscopic scratches. These specialized toothpastes are designed to gently polish the surface, remove stains effectively, and maintain the natural shine of veneers without causing damage. This ensures your smile stays bright and radiant for longer.

**Protects Veneer Integrity:** Harsh abrasives found in many regular toothpastes can scratch and wear down veneers, shortening their lifespan. Veneer whitening toothpastes use gentler abrasives and polishing agents that are safe for veneer materials, protecting their integrity and preventing premature replacement.

**Prevents Staining:** Daily exposure to coffee, tea, wine, and other staining agents can gradually discolor veneers. Veneer whitening toothpastes often contain stain-fighting ingredients that create a protective barrier, preventing stains from adhering to the surface and keeping your veneers looking brighter for extended periods.

**Promotes Gum Health Around Veneers:** Gum health is crucial for the longevity and appearance of veneers. Inflammation and gum recession around veneers can compromise their aesthetics and perhaps lead to complications. Top-rated veneer whitening toothpastes often contain ingredients that promote gum health, reducing inflammation and keeping the gums healthy around the veneer margins.

**Extends the Lifespan of veneers:** By protecting against damage, staining, and gum problems, using the right veneer whitening toothpaste can considerably extend the lifespan of your veneers. This protects your investment and saves you money on potential repairs or replacements in the future.

## FAQs Section

understanding the specifics of veneer whitening toothpaste is important for making informed decisions about your oral care.**Can I use regular whitening toothpaste on my veneers?**
No, it's not recommended to use regular whitening toothpaste on veneers. Most regular whitening toothpastes contain abrasive ingredients or harsh chemicals that can scratch and damage the surface of veneers,dulling their shine and potentially shortening their lifespan. Always opt for a toothpaste specifically formulated for veneers.**How often should I use veneer whitening toothpaste?**
Veneer whitening toothpaste can typically be used twice daily, just like regular toothpaste. However, it's always best to follow the specific recommendations provided on the product packaging or consult with your dentist. They can advise you on the optimal frequency based on your individual oral health needs and the type of veneers you have.

**What ingredients should I avoid in toothpaste if I have veneers?**
If you have veneers,it's generally advisable to avoid toothpastes containing highly abrasive ingredients such as silica,alumina,or dicalcium phosphate dihydrate in high concentrations. Also, steer clear of toothpastes with strong bleaching agents like hydrogen peroxide, as these can sometimes alter the color of the bonding material or the veneers themselves.

**Will veneer whitening toothpaste actually whiten my veneers?**
Technically, no. Veneers cannot be whitened the same way natural teeth can. Veneer whitening toothpaste is designed to *maintain* the existing color and shine by gently removing surface stains and preventing new stains from forming. They cannot change the actual shade of the veneer material itself. If you desire whiter veneers, replacement is the only option.

1mgb6v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicSeven/comments/1mgb6v9/common_rta_mistakes/,Common RTA Mistakes,"A lot of new players are coming in and a lot of people were posting about their frustrations trying to squeeze into Masters before the end of the season. So I figured I will try to compose a relatively concise list of do's and dont's of RTA progression.

1. Do Spend your Resources

Before you even pick what units to build, completely zero out all of your resources. The benefits of using 1k leifs right now massively outshine however many you can spend in 2 days once a month. All unspent resources are wasted power. Use your crafting mats. Summon on banners. Use your charms and powder.

2. Do Use Aurius

Aurius is the absolute best artifact in the game. Your whole team gets a free massive HP battery and becomes significantly sturdier. I always force myself to take mine on 2. Have a slot that you force yourself to take yours between 1, 2 and 3.

3. Don't Play Turn 1 Units

A lot of people blindly build and use units that they hear are strong, get shit on and quit, calling E7 a P2W game. It should be assumed that until you can build at least 2 units at 310 speed, you do not have the gear to assume you will go first. Avoid any units without built in survivability. Evasion, HP scalers, Def scalers, damage reduction, immortalities, passives that activate off-turn, resistances, stealth, revives, and counter attacks are your friend. If a unit requires high attack scaling damage to function, but doesnt have a means to protect themselves, they will not be reliable to use to climb.

4. Do Plan Your Draft

I like to use CeciliaBot's tierlist maker to plan out my intended draft roster. Any tool that lets you organize your units is great. You want to have at least 2 or 3 picks for 1 and 2 each, and always take them. I personally am building my draft around Bastion Belian right now so I have only 1 unit on 3, but you want to have a good roster of counter picks and neutral dps units that fit your strategy. You want at least 2 or 3 of all major roles (cleansers, debuffers, niche counter picks, aurius, openers).

5. Do Trim your Draft

I am guilty of this because at any time I frequently have 60+ units on RTA viable builds. You do not want to spread your very best gear too far out. Try to keep a tight draft of 10-12 units that get the highest priority when you build units. You want to make sure you squeeze all the performance you can out of your most important units that you use the most and rely on. The rest of your units should be on what is left over. for counter pick units, being ""on gear"" is more important than hitting a perfect stat line.

5.5 Do Learn Fribbels

Fribbels is a free PC app that can search your entire roster and inventory to concoct the most mathematically perfect builds that fit exactly what stat lines you want. You will have to have a PC client of E7 installed. I personally love Google Play's client as it runs perfectly smooth with zero bugs at the cost of making swapping accounts harder. The best part is that you can customize a priority list for your units to make sure your 10-12 units get the best of the best gear.

6. Do Learn Playstyles

All of Epic Seven's drafting styles can be broken down into what speed thresholds that they tend to play in. Tank Down plays giga bulky and slow, around 200 and below. Standard is the default and most consistent way to climb, playing between tank down to about 260. Aggro is halfway between cleave and standard and is more flexible but way more difficult to play. Cleave is about 310+ right now. I would absolutely never recommend anyone to play cleave unless they are the kind of person who does not need my advice to begin with.

Valky has on his YouTube an entire guide series dedicated to explaining how to play these styles. I always recommend having one support at 280 that is okay not going first to open for you and provide a tempo option, followed by an aurius pick as a solid 2 unit core for standard drafting that will give you the tools you need to learn RTA.

7. Don't Cook

There is already libraries of guides and tierlists of character RTA power levels and explanations on every units uses. Try to take a peek at people like khm's Turtle School series or Deity's new player RTA tier lists. You do not have to reinvent the wheel. The f2p counterpicks that were good when they released as the game launched, still do their job right now. So many people disregard advice to go their own way. Trying stuff like Fumyr control/cleave at 250 speed with no protection or means to set up the combo safely. Ran  + Eda cleave is not viable anymore. Stop trying to force it at 270 speed. Blue Peira is only a counter to speed units if you and your opponent have EQUAL gear quality. If she gets silenced/killed before she takes a turn, you intentionally volunteered to play a 3v4. If you are struggling in RTA, stop cooking and just go back to basics.

8. Don't Play on Tilt

If you eat a bunch of losses and are feeling frustrated, just take a break. Same as with every other competitive PvP games, your decision making tanks when you get tilted. Go get a drink of coffee or tea, have a snack, watch an anime episode, do some homework. Come back to it when you cool off. The queue is always popping, you arent missing out on anything.

8.5 Don't Sweat Losses

In general, the game is balanced so that players with a negative winrate can climb. This is because of the RNG nature of the game. The devs realize that nobody should be expected to win every single match in a game with this much RNG. You only need about a 40% winrate. Even the top players in the world will have 10+ game loss streaks. Just play games, even if you lose a bunch. If you can handle losing, just power through it. Sometimes legitimately nothing could have been done or you got out drafted.

9. Don't Focus on Who you Don't Have

E7 is not a p2w game where you are required to have every unit to win. Sure, every unit is a tool and more tools is always better, but all of the counterpicks that are required to do well in RTA are available f2p. Again, look up Deity's RTA tierlists if you need an idea of who to use. I can guarantee any tool you need, you have already or will have with a little effort or a side story banner.

10. Craft Gear Better

A piece of gear isn't wasted if it doesn't roll 20 speed. A piece of gear isn't viable just because it rolled 100 ES. There are guides by many creators on how to roll gear and what specific gear to keep, I would recommend checking out guides on YouTube. Lighte7 is one of the top 3 best players in the world and he goes over his crafting thought process for both Wyvern and Banshee gear.

There is a shorter, more basic version here: [https://youtu.be/WQWUOAEYRUU?si=C8amYd3Teul\_Ypoz](https://youtu.be/WQWUOAEYRUU?si=C8amYd3Teul_Ypoz)

Learn what stat combos are good and bad. Learn when stat checking is worthwhile and when it isn't. If you can get this part down, then your account will improve way faster than most people.

Thank you for getting to the end. I could keep writing an entire book but 10 points make for a good list. I know people generally don't like when I make these guide essays but I love E7 RTA and I shall not be deterred! Best of luck! I hope you get the next RTA skin, or at least start having more fun with the game than you are right now.

I am desperately looking for help identifying and managing something that’s been bothering me for a while. 

I get these black stains on every single one of my teeth, especially near the gum line and molars. They:

- can be scraped off with a fingernail or tool pretty easily but not completely
- come back or grow more within a day if not hours
- are not cavities (confirmed by different dentists)
- don’t cause pain, sensitivity or odor 
- are present on small pits of teeth surfaces

Multiple dentists said my teeth and gum are healthy but couldn’t tell me what the black stuff is. I keep good oral hygiene. I:

- brush at least twice daily
- floss at least once daily 
- sometimes I use water floss after meals
- don’t smoke, don’t drink coffee or tea
- don’t use any mouth wash
- use Hello brand toothpaste without SLS as it makes the inside of my mouth peel 
- rinse with baking soda solution a couple of times a week while brushing teeth at night

To make things harder, I’ve just had a baby and I can’t find time to scrape the black stuff off my teeth. The buildup is getting worse and it makes me self-conscious. I really need a way to reduce it or prevent it not just constantly scraping some of it off.

ChatGPT told me it’s likely that it’s caused by chromogenic bacteria and suggested me to use baking soda solution, but he hasn’t helped.

Almost anyone can start selling it now—no credentials, no training, no proper knowledge. It feels like you could wake up tomorrow and suddenly see your neighbor or a random TikTok account offering Tirzepatide (and yes, that’s already happening), complete with “before and after” pics and vague claims. There’s barely any medical guidance or safety protocols that come with the purchase. Walang tamang consultation, walang monitoring, and definitely no proper aftercare instructions.

What's worse is that many of these sellers are just in it for the trend and the profit. They jump in without understanding the medicine, risks, or ethical responsibilities that come with selling a potent medication. And to make it more toxic, some are actively spreading misinformation and even fear-mongering about Tirzepatide and even other sellers—just to gain an edge. It’s giving MLM vibes but worse because health and safety are on the line.

Try asking these sellers a genuine question about the drug, side effects, or even safe storage and handling—and suddenly you're being accused of being another seller trying to ""sabotage"" their business. Instead of answering responsibly, they deflect or attack.

And now that there are so many sellers, it’s starting to feel like there are more sellers than actual buyers. You can already see signs of price wars happening—pababaan ng presyo left and right just to make a sale. At what point does it become unsustainable and unsafe?

Here is Part 10 of Our Reality, seen from MC's perspective in the aftermath of Sayuri's panic attack and running to hide in FXI's offices. MC attempts to calm Sayuri down and then goes to the library with Natsuki to read manga. Unfortunately, there is nowhere to sit in the library so they proceed to the bookstore where Natsuki once again runs into the bookstore manager who expressed interest in her (see part 4). Will their interaction go better this time?

**Part 10: Our Aftermath (MC)**

“Sayuri? Are you okay?” MC asked with concern as Sayuri stood in the doorway to FXI’s suite of offices, looking terrified. Her eyes rapidly darted between the warm gray walls of the office and out the windows where snow was beginning to fall more intensely.

*She’s a complete wreck. What happened to her?*

She shook her head as her body trembled with fear. “MC…I…I had to run. They wanted me to get in…some kind of small tube in a machine…and I panicked.”

MC looked confused. “What do you mean? The medical checkup?”

Sayuri nodded. “It looked like a horizontal version of…part of the machine that brought us here. I…a thought just suddenly popped into my head when I saw the scanner that it was going to send me back to the digital world.”

*What?*

MC put a comforting arm around Sayuri to support her as he guided her to a comfortable black leather couch that sat near the entrance to the office. “It’s okay. Just relax and breathe. Would you like me to get you some water or a soda?”

Sayuri nodded slowly again. Her breath continued to come in ragged gasps as she struggled to bring her emotions under control.

“Yes…t-thank you.”

MC walked to the small breakroom in the office and opened the refrigerator, belatedly realizing that he had not asked Sayuri what kind of beverage she wanted.

*She’s really shaken up. I’ll just bring her a water and a soda and let her choose. Maybe Sayori and the others will be able to fill me in about what happened.*

As if on cue, his phone chimed with a message from Sayori.

*Something about the medical scan made her panic and run away. We’ll come meet you at your office. Please take care of her.*

He typed a quick response back.

*Of course. I sat her down on a couch and I’m getting her something to drink. Everyone here is in a meeting but when they get out of it they may be able to help too.*

MC walked back to the couch to find Sayuri leaning her head back on the pillows with her eyes closed.

*Did she pass out?*

Sayuri opened her eyes at the sound of MC approaching. He held up the two beverage bottles in his hands and gave her a reassuring smile.

“I wasn’t sure what you wanted to drink, so I grabbed sparkling water and a cola. Which would you like?”

Sayuri blinked as if unable to comprehend the question in her dazed state but quickly shook her head to clear it.

“Oh...thanks for grabbing those, MC,” she replied with a smile, though her eyes betrayed her exhaustion, “The sparkling water sounds great.”

MC handed her the bottle. “Hope you like raspberry lime flavor.”

Sayuri nodded distractedly. “I’m sure it will be good.”

She opened the bottle and took a long drink from it before putting it down on a glass side table next to the couch. She looked up at MC, who had sat back down at his nearby desk and appeared to be trying to consume his bottle of cola as quickly as possible.

“MC…am I…am I c-crazy? Or dumb?”

MC frowned. “No. Why would you say something like that about yourself?’

Sayuri sighed. “Now that I’ve thought about it I know that medical scanner wasn’t going to send me back to the digital world. But why did I think that it was going to? Why did I panic? Am I stupid for feeling this way?”

MC shook his head. “I don’t know why you panicked, Sayuri. But it’s okay. You don’t have to be perfect. It’s okay to have fears.”

Sayuri nodded slowly. “I just don’t want to cause problems for everyone. I’m not supposed to be here, so I have to make sure I’m never a burden. I don’t want everyone else to concern themselves with me.”

MC shook his head again.

*After all that has happened, how could she think that we wouldn’t want to support her?*

“Sayuri, no-” he began before Sayuri cut him off.

“Sayuri YES,” she said in a tone that could only be described as bittersweet, “MC, you don’t understand. While we’re all incredibly lucky to be here, I was never supposed to exist. I was created by a mistake. And now I’m here, a young woman with her life ahead of me. What did I do to deserve this? Why am I here? You were part of theoriginal story. I wasn’t. I’m just…I can’t…I don’t want to make things harder for my friends, you included, just because of some silly fear I have. I don’t matter.”

She leaned back into the cushions of the couch and leaned her head against her right hand, obscuring her blue-purple eyes. MC sat back in his chair, stunned by Sayuri’s word

*I don’t know what to say to her. I never have the right words for a situation like this.*

The door to the office suite opened, and much to MC’s relief the remaining members of the Literature Club, led by Sayori, entered.

*So glad they’re here. But man…this office is full of cute girls now!*

“Sayuri! Are you okay?” Sayori asked, sitting down next to her cousin and giving her a comforting hug.

Sayuri looked over and smiled weakly.

“Yeah…I just…panicked back there. That medical scanner looked so much like part of the machine that brought us here and I…for some reason I thought it was going to send me back to the digital world. It’s a stupid thought, I know. Sorry I made a mess of things up here.”

Sayori continued to embrace Sayuri. “No…don’t say you’re sorry. It’s okay.”

“Seriously though,” Natsuki said, “Don’t scare us like that.”

“I believe that what you may have been experiencing is a phobia,” Yuri explained helpfully, “It is not uncommon to have one. If anything, I would consider this proof that you are, in fact, fully human.”

“Yuri, you always have such interesting perspectives,” Sayuri replied, her smile growing and becoming more genuine, “I always love to hear your take on things.”

“In the end, I don’t think it’s a big deal,” Monika said reassuringly, “The Metaverse people might get annoyed but I’m sure our friends here at FXI can smooth things over.”

As if on cue, the dark brown wood door to the office suite’s conference room opened and the FXI President, FXI CFO, and FXI CTO emerged carrying their laptop computers, looking surprised to see the members of the Literature Club.

“Oh. Hi everyone,” the FXI President began, “What brings you all down here?”

Sayuri raised her hand. “I panicked when they brought us to the medical scan room, ran out, and came down here to hide.”

“I see,” the FXI President said with concern, “Are you feeling okay now though?”

Sayuri nodded. “Exhausted, but I’ll be okay.”

The FXI President smiled. “Glad to hear you’ll be okay. We’re actually about to head out to a meeting with a client here in the building, so if you don’t want to go all the way back up to your place want somewhere to rest and hang out, feel free to use my office.”

“The computers we ordered for you also arrived,” the FXI CTO added, “We ordered Compaq EliteBooks for you all, so hopefully you like them. They’re in my office so make sure to grab them when you have a chance.”

“And feel free to help yourselves to drinks and snacks,” the FXI CFO offered, “There are plenty in the break room.”

“Thank you,” Monika replied, “We really appreciate all your hospitality. We’ll get out of your way in a moment. We just wanted to check on Sayuri and then I and whoever else wants to come are going to go back to shopping. Who else wants to join me?”

Sayori and Yuri raised their hands. Sayori nudged her cousin, who continued to lean back on the couch in exhaustion.

“You want to come with us, Sayuri?”

Sayuri opened her eyes slowly. “I’ll…I’ll catch up with you in a bit. I may need to just lie down for about half an hour.”

Yuri looked at Natsuki. “Do you not intend to continue shopping with us? I was rather enjoying selecting outfits with you.”

Natsuki smiled and gestured to MC. “Nope! We’re going down to the library for manga time!”

Sayori’s expression flickered again, but the smile quickly returned to her face.

“I do need to go downstairs to check out some coding books to help me learn more about being a developer,” MC said, “But yes, we can do some manga time as well.”

“Sounds like you all have good plans for the afternoon,” the FXI President said.

He turned to the FXI CTO. “You ready to head upstairs for the client meeting?”

The FXI CTO nodded. “Let me grab a bottle of water for the road and then let’s do it.”

The two executives left the office. As the FXI CFO turned to walk back to her office, Yuri approached her.

“Um…excuse me…c-could I speak with you for a moment?”

The FXI CFO turned and gave Yuri a warm smile. “Of course. What would you like to discuss?”

“I have…a business concept,” Yuri explained, her voice gaining confidence, “And I understand that a development of a financial plan is necessary to determine if it is a viable idea. I’ve been told that you are extremely knowledgeable about financial matters, and I was hoping that you might be able to help me learn to develop such a plan.”

The FXI CFO nodded. “Absolutely. Good for you for finding the entrepreneurial spirit. This afternoon is completely slammed, but let’s find some time to sit down this week or next and talk. Send me a text to remind me and I’ll check my calendar.”

Yuri smiled. “Thank you. I appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge.”

MC observed their interaction and smiled to himself.

*So great to see Yuri excited about a business idea. I hope she succeeds!*

His thoughts were interrupted by Natsuki gently poking him.

“Hey. Dummy. Manga time.”

MC gave her a smirk. “Dummy, huh? I’m still the first one of us to get a full-time job. But yeah, let me pack up my computer and then we can go.”

As he turned to walk back to his desk, Sayori stopped him.

“Do you want to meet up for dinner later?”

MC turned to face her. “Oh…maybe. Natsuki and I were planning on grabbing something quickly for dinner tonight and going back to reading, but send me a message when you’re done shopping and we can see where we are.”

 Sayori’s expression briefly changed to one of disappointment. “Oh…okay…I think Monika, Yuri and I will just do dinner in the mall. But I’ll let you know.”

MC nodded. “Okay. Well text me if you want to do something later.”

*Why does she look disappointed? I’m still working on planning a nice date night for us.*

“Come on, MC,” Natsuki said impatiently, “There’s a lot of manga to get through.”

MC glanced back at Sayori as he was practically dragged out of the office by Natsuki. “I guess I’ll see you all later.”

He followed her to the elevator bay, and as they waited to head down to the underground library Natsuki removed some of the manga she had brought from her bag.

“I’m thinking we start with this one,” she said, handing him a copy of the first book of ‘My Superhero School,’ “I think this will be one we both like. It’s got action and slice of life elements.”

MC examined the book. “Was this one of the ones that was recommended by that guy at the bookstore who likes you?”

Natsuki blushed but quickly regained her composure. “Yeah. So what? He made a good recommendation, that’s all. It’s not like I wanted to go out with him or anything.”

MC gave her a smirk. *Sure you didn’t. You’re not fooling anyone, Natsuki.*

The elevator chimed and they entered it alongside several businesspeople who appeared to be going to the lobby for sales calls and other meetings. A short time later the elevator arrived on the second basement level that contained the underground mall and library.

“Alright, let’s go find a table in the library where we can read together,” Natsuki said, gesturing to the sign that pointed the way to the library, “This place is so cool.”

MC nodded. “Lead the way.”

Natsuki led MC down the shop-lined hallway to the large underground library, which was filled with students studying after their school days had ended. Soft piano music played in the background, while on the stage a podium was being set up for a lecture. MC looked around, visibly impressed.

*This is amazing. It’s as if someone had designed the perfect space for the Literature Club.*

He turned back to Natsuki. “I can see why you wanted to come down here. This place is awesome.”

Natsuki grinned. “Right? Now we just have to find somewhere to sit.”

MC and Natsuki walked a lap of the library, but due to its crowded state they were unable to find a table at which to sit.

“What’s going on here?” Natsuki wondered, “This place is totally slammed. Where are we supposed to read our manga?”

“Since almost everyone in here is wearing school uniforms,” MC indicated with a gesture around the library, “And we’re approaching the holidays I would guess they’re all studying for winter exams.”

“Ohhhh…that makes sense,” Natsuki replied with an understanding nod, “Definitely not going to miss those now that we’re in the real world and done with school.”

“Yeah but now we have to be responsible and stuff,” MC countered, “I have to get on a plane next week to MES HQ to go work with them.”

“Yeah…,” Natsuki sighed, “I need to figure out what I want to do. Hey, promise you won’t laugh if I share a crazy idea with you?”

MC nodded. “Of course.”

Natsuki paused to gather her thoughts. “I think I want to go to France and learn to be a pastry chef. I know…I know…totally wacky idea.”

MC shook his head. “I don’t think it’s wacky at all. You love to bake, and that seems like a natural extension of your passion.”

*I hope she does pursue her passion.*

“Yeah, but let’s say I do get a culinary education,” Natsuki continued, “What I am I going to do with it?”

MC thought for a moment. “Have you ever thought of opening your own business?”

Natuski raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Now who has the crazy idea? Actually, it would be really cool to have my own shop. But that’s a ways off. I’ve also played around with the idea of drawing my own manga, but that would be a side project.”

A thought came to MC. *Maybe we can work together on the visual novel idea I’ve been playing with.*

“Funny you should mention that…I’ve actually been kicking around the idea of making a visual novel sort of based on us. Not the same as manga I know, but maybe we could work together to create some ideas.”

“I like that idea,” Natsuki agreed, “Got a name for it?”

MC looked away. “You’ll probably think it’s silly and I’m sure you could come up with a better name, but my working title is ‘Osaka Nights: Tales of Love and Literature.’”

Natuski grinned. “I don’t hate it. It’s a good enough title that it would get my attention, but we can see what else we come up with.”

MC returned her smile. *At least she didn’t call me an idiot or make fun of me.*

“Anyway,” Natsuki continued, “It looks like we’re going to have to wait a bit to get a table and sit down and read. Want to go for a walk around the mall? We could stop by the bookstore and look at their manga selection.”

MC nodded. “Sure. And that might give you another chance to talk to a certain someone.”

Natsuki blushed slightly and scowled at MC. “That’s…that’s not it at all! I just want to be a good friend and show you a good source of manga!”

MC held up his hands in mock surrender. “Okay, okay.”

Natsuki led MC down one of the halls that branched off from the library that would lead them to the bookstore. As they walked down the polished floor, MC observed the stores that lined both sides of the hallway that were currently fairly quiet but would soon be filled with shoppers as the workday came to an end.

One shop in particular caught his eye.

*I’ll have to get Natsuki’s opinion about that.*

They arrived at the bookstore and walked in. MC took in the dark wood shelves that lined every wall of the store with books and the literary posters that hung above them. To Natsuki’s visible relief, the store manager she had talked to previously was nowhere in sight.

“This place is pretty big,” MC observed as he looked around at the shelves.

“Yeah, it is,” Natsuki agreed.

She pointed to the right. “Manga is over here.”

They spent the next several minutes looking at manga and poking friendly fun at each other’s tastes. Natsuki picked out a volume and turned to show it to MC only to come face to face with the bookstore manager.

“Hi, can I help you find…oh,” he began, “Natsuki.”

Natsuki looked away. “H-hi.”

“Hey, I just wanted to apologize,” the bookstore manager said, “I was too forward. I just…you really do seem like a really cool person.”

“It’s…it’s okay, but I appreciate and accept your apology,” Natsuki replied, “I…reacted more strongly than I should have.”

MC overheard their interaction while examining the selection of manga books on one of the shelves.

*Good. She accepted his apology. Now let’s see if he asks her out again.*

The bookstore manager looked relieved, “Well hopefully we can put this behind us and maybe kind of start over. The invite to stop by our manga club still stands and…”

He trailed off as he saw MC, who had been kneeling down to look at a low shelf and had turned with the intent of showing it to Natsuki.

“Ah…of course,” he said quietly, a tone of disappointment creeping into his voice, “This must be your boyfriend. I understand. Well, I’d still like to get to know you…as a friend of course. If you’re interested in the manga club, drop by the library tomorrow night at eight.”

He turned and walked back towards the store’s front desk before Natsuki could reply. She turned back to MC, who held up the manga book he had picked out.

“Did I hear that right?” MC asked.

“Yeah,” Natsuki replied quietly, “You did. I’m now two for two on messing up conversations with a guy who’s interested in me. But…it’s his fault for not letting me explain that you and I are just good friends.”

Her face shifted to something resembling a half-smile. “It is kind of funny that he thought we were together though.”

“What’s so wrong with that?” MC asked, “You make it sound like you’d be ashamed to be dating me.”

Natsuki shook her head. “No, it’s not that…I just…I mean, you’re with Sayori and…”

She paused as MC looked expectantly at her.

“I kinda did want to accept his invitation for a coffee date, okay?” she said, the words coming rapidly.

MC held up a hand. “Called it.”

Natsuki gave him a look that was half smile and half scowl. “Well look who’s learned to be less of a dense anime protagonist. What next? Are you going to show me a poem that’s more than just twenty random words dumped on a page?”

MC laughed quietly. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I still think you’d probably find my poetry disappointing.”

*A little levity is what we need right now. She’s clearly disappointed with how this turned out so the best thing I can do is try to make her smile.*

He looked toward the store’s front desk. “You want me to go explain that I’m not your boyfriend?”

Natuski vigorously shook her head. “No. I’ll do it.”

MC and Natsuki walked toward the front desk and the exit to the store. As they did the bookstore manager turned away, clearly avoiding Natsuki’s eyes.

Natsuki sighed. “Come on,” she whispered to MC, “Let’s just go.”

They exited the store in silence and walked back towards the library, not speaking for a long moment. After several minutes, Natsuki turned to MC.

“Since I don’t have a love life of my own right now, let’s talk about yours,” she began, “Where are you taking Sayori for date night?”

“I want to do something fun but also have some alone time with Sayori,” MC explained, “There’s a little Italian restaurant a few levels down near the subway station that’s supposed to be both really good and very intimate.”

Natsuki nodded. “That’s a good start. What’s the plan for after dinner?”

“I was thinking we could get an after dinner drink at the new bar here in the mall,” MC continued, “And then finish up the night with some ice cream and cookies from the shop on the fourth floor before heading home.”

Natsuki smiled with satisfaction. “I like it. And I think Sayori will too. Nicely planned.”

MC returned her smile. “I appreciate your approval. I hope she’ll enjoy it. This will be our first date in the real world so I want to make it the best I can.”

Natsuki held up a hand. “One other thing. You should tell her about it tonight, both so she can decide what to wear and because it will cheer her up. I think she was a little sad that we broke off from the group to go read manga. Which we haven’t actually done, by the way.”

“Ah, good idea.” MC agreed, “I’ll definitely tell her when I see her later.”

*I guess Sayori did seem a bit bummed that I was spending the afternoon with Natsuki.*

They came to the store that had caught his attention earlier, which featured marble floors and several cases of beautiful gold, silver, and platinum jewelry, and MC stopped.

“Mind if we stop in here?” MC asked, “I wanted to get your thoughts on something.”

Natsuki glanced into the store. “Oh…sure. Are you looking for a Christmas present for Sayori?”

MC nodded. “Something like that.”

As MC and Natsuki turned to walk into the store, their phones both buzzed in their pockets. Natsuki raised her phone and looked at the message, which was from Monika.

*Hey guys, we’re starting to think about dinner. How do you feel about the Asian fusion place near the entrance to the department store at 6 tonight?*

MC glanced at the clock on his phone, which showed the time to be just before 5PM.

“That would give us two solid hours of manga time,” he observed.

Natsuki nodded. “Let’s do it. Hopefully we can find seats in the library.”

She typed a reply back to Monika. *Sounds good! We’ll meet you there.*

Monika’s reply came quickly. *See you then!*

“Cool,” Natsuki said as she put away her phone, “Let’s go find somewhere to sit and finally read this manga.”",1,1754197477.0,DDLC,2,1.0,False

1mgaq8v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgaq8v,Big Island Trip Report 7/25- 8/1/25,"Eight of us went on this trip. Four adults and four teenagers.

We both stayed in the Mauna Lani area. My family stayed in the golf villas and my buddy and his family stayed at the fairways.

This is my second time at this location and I just love it. My buddies condo at the fairways which was only about a mile and a half away from my location was equally nice. It’s location next to the shops make it ideal for walking and getting coffee or going to market. My location is too far to walk, but it is within walking distance to the beach club which to me Trump’s a walk to the market.

The accommodations were top notch no complaints here just amazing.

We took the catamaran tour to Captain Cook monument for snorkeling and we used Kona style. I’ve used them a few times in the past and they’re just a very great outfit, professional friendly and helpful. That was a magical morning, indeed.

We had dinner one night at Tommy Bahamas and other than their coconut shrimp not really impressed with the rest of their food.

The highlight dinner of the week has to be Canoe House. The night was perfect warm tradewinds, but not too windy. We sat outside, practically right on the sand. The food was just incredible. We had the tasting menu which featured fresh seafood, Wagyu beef, and so many other good things I can’t remember to mention. Their Mai Tai was the best I had all week. It’s very pricey, but if you can go, book a table and make it your fancy dinner. Simply incredible.

We went to volcanoes and did a 5 mile hike. We went to the Hilo farmers market, which is always fun and charming. The weather on the Hilo side this week was incredible. Very warm with little small clouds in the sky. We also found a hidden waterfall that the locals go to, and it was amazing. We swam and got under the waterfall and also did a few daring jumps from the cliffs.

Tsunami’s were not in our itinerary, but on our way back from Hilo while stopping in Waimea, our phone started delivering us news that there was a tsunami warning, and we were not going to be allowed back in our lodging on the coast. This was about 3 PM. We decided to wait it out at the big island brewhouse, which naturally is a thing to do when facing danger, nothing like a little liquid courage. Not knowing what to do we took a drive until it got dark and then went back to Waimea and waited in the parking lot. I had made a friend while visiting church on Sunday and he reached out to me and invited us to his house to wait it out. That turned out to be great because it calmed the kids nerves down and we stayed there until about 11:30 and as it turns out the warning was lifted around 11:45 and we finally got back to our rooms tired but glad everyone was safe.

It’s amazing how fast the week goes by in paradise, but it did. Wished I would’ve spent more time just lounging around on the beach, but we had a lot of laughs and a lot of fun and some amazing experiences. This is my third trip to the big island and people keep saying I should go to another island next time I don’t know. I do know that whenever it’s time to leave I really don’t wanna go and when I get back, I can’t wait to return.",10,1754196912.0,VisitingHawaii,5,0.92,False

TLDR: I'm building a small tool - an iOS/Android app that notifies you when you're near your friends.

The Why: Loneliness is rampant in our society. We all know this. BUT there's some research to indicate proximity [HERE](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4268773/) [HERE](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8357142/) and organic random interactions(serendipity [HERE](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/testing-a-small-and-early-intervention-the-serendipity-of-friendships-in-students-social-networks#:~:text=Are%20you%20still%20friends%20with,are%20affected%20by%20early%20exposure.)) can have a positive bonding effect on friendships.

The What: Building a very lite location based iOS/Android app that allows you to build a simple profile, connect with friends, set how close your friends can get before you get a notification, and see a history of past notifications. That's it. No map no in-app messaging. The idea here is to install and forget then use it to bump into friends at Walmart, the coffee shop, or on the morning commute. Very strict privacy controls here. Notifications require that both people accept. Vacation/ghost mode can be toggled.

I’m a teacher, but go back to work next week. Let’s see if I can survive without my coffee. Another thing is that my husband would randomly surprise me with Frosty’s.. not often. The last time he brought me one I didn’t even touch it.

My Mind is Blown 🤯 (Am I the Only One Who Didn’t Know?!),"I’m actually... not sure how to feel about this, and also, HOW did nobody tell me earlier?! 🙃 

Am I just LATE? Did you know there are people out here making *real money* (like, usable, not monopoly cash) from testing new features in apps... and the apps pay you for it?! I went down a rabbit hole last night, people – prepare for your mind to EXPLODE or just, at least, be moderately interested.

First things first, if you find yourself fruitlessly scrolling and actually WANT your apps to be *more fun* (and stuff that secretly pays you??) check here:   
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

Okay, but seriously, on with my findings... The best-of-the-best, legit apps that give you money *just for test-driving their new features*, as of 2025. This feels ILLEGAL to know, but here we go:

---

## 1. **BetaSurveys**

- Yes, the name is boring. The tasks are NOT.  
- They send unreleased app builds directly to your phone, and you get paid to break them (or use them, if you’re a nice tester).  

## 2. **PlayTest Pilot**

- It’s like product testing, but for the laziest among us.  
- Payouts hit in hours, sometimes even MINUTES...😳  
- My friend bought coffee with this, dead serious.

## 3. **Userlytics**

- You just record yourself being confused by new features.  
- Honest confusion gets paid. Apparently I’m not the only one?  
- Anyway, check it out: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

## 4. **TryItEarly**

- You get actual beta versions of hyped apps before ANYONE else.  
- Found 3 apps I now love – and got paid to do it?!  
- You’ll need to leave detailed feedback, but it’s weirdly satisfying.

## 5. **FeatureLab360**

- They sometimes leak unreleased social features (think TikTok-for-grownups vibe).  
- Fast payments and no weird crypto requests. PRAISE.  
- You know what else pays you instantly?  
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

## 6. **Testers Union**

- Feels like a secret club.  
- You pick your test projects, and there’s a Discord where people SWAP HACKS.  
- Value for time: wild. (It literally replaced my entire side-gig hustle).

## 7. **GoodNovel TestApp**

- Straight-up – THIS is what started it for me.  
- Free sign up, instant notifications for tests, and payments I swear landed the next day.  
- Try it or just lurk and LOL at the feature requests.  
- Do NOT miss out: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

---

Look, I’m still in literal shock that in 2025 you can get paid just for playing with unreleased features and spotting bugs others miss. 

No, it isn’t going to make you a millionaire (unless you find a billion-dollar bug, in which case... hook me up?!). But if your idea of “fun” is exploring cool new features before everyone else, you HAVE TO TRY at least one from this list.

And if you’re a total skeptic (same) – start small, try the one here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. Take a screenshot of your first payout, post it here, and let’s collectively drop our jaws together.

Anyone else in this universe already testing for cash in 2025?

1mgahvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1mgahvq/feedback_on_tool_to_help_build_friendships/,Feedback On Tool To Help Build Friendships,"Hi There!  
First, I'm so appreciative of the bravery and vulnerability demonstrated on this forum! If you have the capacity - I would be so appreciative for your reactions to the below idea. This is just in the ideation phase so feel free to put crazy ideas out there.

[Take the Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDF8kwAXLBSIH3w9PpZzQVmDiwBHnatw-P2oI9LUTN4U9dBw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=112266075672551249335)!

TLDR: I'm building a small tool - an iOS/Android app that notifies you when you're near your friends.

The Why: Loneliness is rampant in our society. We all know this. BUT there's some research to indicate proximity [HERE](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4268773/) [HERE](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8357142/) and organic random interactions(serendipity [HERE](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/testing-a-small-and-early-intervention-the-serendipity-of-friendships-in-students-social-networks#:~:text=Are%20you%20still%20friends%20with,are%20affected%20by%20early%20exposure.)) can have a positive bonding effect on friendships.

The What: Building a very lite location based iOS/Android app that allows you to build a simple profile, connect with friends, set how close your friends can get before you get a notification, and see a history of past notifications. That's it. No map no in-app messaging. The idea here is to install and forget then use it to bump into friends at Walmart, the coffee shop, or on the morning commute. Very strict privacy controls here. Notifications require that both people accept. Vacation/ghost mode can be toggled.

Had the cranberrys about an hour later and expected to hate them, but they were genuinely kind of good, not too acidic or bitter, a sharp sweet fruity kick and a slightly better texture than the raisins. An almost syrupy chew(6). The dry roasted nuts were an easy win(6) they didnt taste unlike any other dry roasted peanut, portion size is pathetic though.

Dinner 4pm: (8/10): Genuinely one of the better mains of all the menus, the chorizo style sausage and the sauce combined with the cheese and saltine cracker things... it gives off a strong pepperoni pizza vibe. These components fit together really well. I would happily eat this main again.

Overall Score: 7/10: A good menu all around, but its dissapoiting to have good jerky ruined by raisins and having 2 servings of Trail mix presented in different ways. I do think it would be a great addition to a rotation and wouldn't be upset if I was made to have this again tomorrow... especially considering I have menu 5 again as a sub for menu 21... more chicken chunks.

There was this animated radio show of this little guy with a altered high voice I think his name was Joe. I THINK he wore an orange shirt, but the rest of him was very stick figure-like, but he had a fully animated face. The animation was very fluid, but the lines were a little shaky and thick-ish.  I'd compare the animation era to the old Simon's Cat animations. The intro played some preppy, I think patriotic?, iconic theme song (I'll try finding what song it was, but it was similar to Hungarian Dance and oddly enough the National Anthem??) while he was saying or displaying the phone number to call while drinking coffee (which alongside my intuitive feeling his name was Joe, he also started each radio show drinking a CUP of JOE) Also, he did like actually either take phone calls to his radio station or used voicemails left by actual people because there were always real people talking. Like a real radio show. It was just animated into short animations. I'd say the videos were probably 5-10 minutes long. Maybe even shorter. I remember there was this one time he received a call and there was this little girl talking and the animated guy was making like a ""awwww"" face with hearts around him. (I think)

There was this running gag in the animation...where his pants would fall down and you could see his little guy hanging down represented by a singular short black line. I remember there was a bit where he was jumping on a trampoline and his pants came off, that's why I remember that gag being a thing. I also think his head was square-ish?

**Parse the Odds: A Statistical Tango of Near-Equality**  
The KBO’s Doosan Bears (vs. SSG Landers) is a statistical chess match where both teams have the mathematical precision of a spreadsheet and the chaos of a toddler in a candy store. The moneyline is locked at **1.91 for both teams**, implying a 52.3% implied probability for each—a toss-up if ever there was one. The spread tells a slightly different story: SSG is favored by 1.5 runs at most books, but the odds (ranging from **-150 to -157**) suggest bookmakers think SSG’s edge is more of a “gentle nudge” than a knockout punch. Meanwhile, the total runs line sits at **9.0**, with “Over” priced at 1.95-1.98 and “Under” at 1.8-1.85. In simpler terms, this game is expected to be as explosive as a piñata at a fireworks factory.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Quirks, and the Eternal Struggle of Pitchers**  
Recent updates from the KBO frontlines? Let’s dive in:

* **SSG Landers**: Their ace, **Jung Min-ho**, has been throwing so consistently it’s rumored he sets his pre-pitch routine to a metronome. However, his backup catcher recently admitted he’s been “chasing sunsets” during warmups, which might explain why three wild pitches hit the backstop last week.
* **Doosan Bears**: Their slugger, **Kim Tae-an**, is nursing a “bean-related injury” after a post-game incident where he tried to shatter a record for most home runs *and* most beanbags thrown in a single season. (Spoiler: He failed, but the hospital stay was free.) Meanwhile, their bullpen’s collective ERA is 4.85—about the same as a coffee machine’s chances of winning a marathon.

Kumakaen kami ng anak ko (3 yrs old). Bata pa at napalikot kaya nabagsak at nabasag nya ang coffee mug ko.

Pagkalinis ko, maya-maya lang may unknown number na nagtext saken, nangutang at hindi daw marunong magbayad ang asawa ko (M29).

Sinend ko sa asawa ko ang text at pagkauwi nya sa bahay kinausap ko sya saan sya umutang at magkano. 

Sa ONLINE LENDING APP daw. 
Pinakita nya saken ung app, ang dami nyang loan sa isang app. Hindi bababa sa lima ang loan nya dun na nasa 2K-9K per loan.

Ang hindi ko inaasahan. Hindi lang pala isa.
Hindi lang pala sa isang lending app sya may utang. Madami. Madami pa kong online lending app sa cellphone nya, at lahat ng yun may loan sya. Sumatotal, umabot ng hindi bababa ng 75K lahat. Lahat halos due date na. Kaya naman pala din ang daming tumatawag sa kanya na unknown number, yun pala maniningil yun ng utang.

BINAYARAN KO YUN LAHAT. Ang inipon ipon ko ng ilang taon, nawala na parang bula. Ako na hindi ugali mangutang ay umutang para may pangbayad sa utang na hindi naman ako ang nakinabang (Nabayaran ko naman din yung inutang ko. Thank you Lord!)

Ang asawa ko walang trabaho, sya ang nasa bahay para magalaga sa anak namin. Since saming dalawa ako mas may ok ang kita sa work. Pero may maliit na online business na sya nagaasikaso, na galing din saken ang initial puhunan, para nga kahit papano hindi sya maburyo sa bahay.

Tinanong ko sya, san nya ginamit? Ang sabi nya sa business. - Ok. business. Pero wala naman akong nakikitang positive movement sa business, at wala din naman sya nabibigay dito sa bahay. 

So ok na yun. Solved na since nabayaran ko na lahat ng utang nya at pinag uninstall na lahat ng lending app sa phone nya. At ang plano babayaran nya nalang daw ako. Nagusap kami at nagstart na din sya magwork as rider. Hindi nadin naman ganun kabantayin ang anak namin at hybrid din naman set up ko sa work, magbiyahe sya kapag off ako sa work. 

Pero pagkalipas lang ata ng isa o dalawang buwan. Naisipan kong hiramin ang phone nya. Dun ko nakita, ang dami na naman ngang lending app, ang dami nya na namang loan. 

Yun pala nascam sya sa telegram, may nakausap sya dun na may gagawin lang syang activity tapos magkakapera sya. Pero para makuha yung withdrawal balance dun, kelangan  magtop up ng pera. Nasilaw sa malaking pera na pwede makuha, kaya nagtop up sya ng nagtop up. Kaso ang ginamit nyang pera ay galing sa utang at this time nakapangutang pa sya sa iba, sa tropa nya. Ang alam ko hindi bababa sa 30K naman ang utang nya. 

Hindi ko na sya tinulungan this time, kasi mauubos ako. Hindi lang financially, buong pagkatao ko, nauubos.

Nagsabi na din sya sa magulang nya, sabi nya sinabi nya na lahat. Kaya kinausap ko mother in law ko. Ang alam lang nya ay yung sa scam. Kaya sinabi ko na lahat sa kanya. 

Masakit lang sa part ko bakit hindi sya nagsabi saken kaagad, hinintay pa nya na lumaki. Malaking epekto saken nung 75K, kasi ako lang din naman halos gumagastos dito sa bahay. Savings at pangemergency ko nadin na pera yun. 

Ilang weeks nadin nakakalipas, bumaba nadin ang galit ko. Nasakto na nasa 200 karma ko dito sa reddit. Kaya nakapagpost na ko dito.

Nakapagisip isip at nasa acceptance stage na ko. Balik pagiipon at kapit kay Lord para gabayan kami.

Siguro kung nasa kasagsagan pa ko ng galit, puro mura nalang nasabi ko dito. 

Noon ko narealize na masamang pangitain nga pala talaga kapag may nabasag na baso 😅

I'm making this post out of sheer desperation and discomfort. I'm at my wits' end. I haven't been able to have a bowel movement for two weeks. Yes, you read that right—14 days.

It started out as a minor inconvenience, the kind of thing you brush off with ""I'll just drink more water."" But it has escalated into a full-blown physical and mental crisis.

Here's what I've tried so far:

Massive hydration: I've been drinking a gallon of water a day, easily.

Fiber, glorious fiber: I've been eating fibrous foods like a rabbit—oatmeal, salads, whole grains. I've also been taking fiber supplements.

Prune juice and coffee: My mornings now consist of a bitter cocktail of prune juice followed by strong coffee. It's done absolutely nothing except make me feel more bloated and a little jittery.

Over-the-counter laxatives: I've tried multiple kinds of stool softeners and stimulant laxatives, all to no avail. The stimulants just give me cramps with no results.

Gentle exercise: I’ve been taking walks and doing light stretches, hoping to get things moving.

Dietary changes: I've cut out dairy and most processed foods.

I'm constantly bloated, tired, and in a state of low-grade discomfort that has made it impossible to focus on work or enjoy my life. The mental toll is honestly the worst part—the constant worry and obsession over this is exhausting.

I know the common advice, but I'm looking for anyone who has been in a similar, severe situation. What worked for you? Did you have to go to a doctor? Is there something I'm missing here? Any specific products or remedies that are a last resort?

I'm ready to try almost anything. Thanks in advance for any and all advice.

TL;DR: Haven't pooped in two weeks, tried everything from water to laxatives, nothing is working. Looking for serious advice from people who have been through this, beyond the standard recommendations.",1,1754195608.0,NoPoo,9,0.53,False

I’ve been on a lot of dates, but they’ve always been with guys that I’ve got along with but I’m not actually attracted to…and I have tried to force it. I had pretty low self esteem in high school and have became a lot more social and outgoing in uni. I’m tall and blonde and a lot of people have this assumption about me that I could get “any guy I want”. I never used to keep my virginity a secret but I’ve become so ashamed that with new friends and even old friends, when they make these assumptions that I must have dated super hot guys, or that I’ve had sex before, I’ll just kind of leave it or laugh it off. It’s starting to feel like I’m playing a role…and it’s really upsetting me. I’ve always loved being open about “taboo” things and I never imagined myself being this inexperienced at this age. It’s staring to influence my own perception of myself and my values. 

I just don’t know what the issue is? I know I’m into guys, when I actually meet ones I’m attracted to I do get very nervous…but in the past they haven’t been into me. I’m into tall, confident, and sometimes nonchalant guys, and I swear it feels like they can smell the virgin in me? I’m not really meeting people as most of my friends are girls and don’t really go out anymore/have partners so my weekends are mostly spent at wine bars or coffee shops. And on the off chance I go to a party/go out it’s all very underwhelming and nothing really happens?

I’m starting to worry that when I actually do meet a guy I like who’s interested, my inexperience is gonna be too much of a thing and he will be put off. And I wouldn’t blame him. I just feel like it’s too late and I’ve run out time, and now the more time passes, the more it’s gonna become a thing.

But, after a few messages, things went quiet, and we didn’t talk for about four weeks (It was my mistake, I left her message unseen for 4 weeks straight). Then I sent her a meme out of the blue, and she liked it within minutes. Not long after, she liked one of my stories that night. My friends started encouraging me to ask her out, they think she’s genuinely interested. From what I’ve seen, she seems like a genuinely good person, hardworking, grounded, and just… Different in a way that stands out. I’ve rarely felt this kind of interest in someone, not based on looks, but who she seems to be. Since I wasn’t sure how to keep the conversation going, I steered it toward studies. It wasn’t super engaging, but we managed to keep the chat going for about four days, with both of us replying every 5–6 or so. Eventually, on a friend’s advice, I wished her luck for exams (she reciprocated warmly), and then casually asked ""By the way, do you like coffee?"". Her reply ""Nah 😅"" came a full day later & when I replied ""That's rare! Coffee se hate?"", again she took a whole day to reply ""Haha yes I don't like tea or coffee. I know that's weird 😅"".  And, what's with this 😅 all the time?
Now I’m unsure. My friends still think she’s into me because she’s been engaging, liking things, and responding with interest when we talk.

Has taking meds helped you in your parenting and running the household? Please explain, what you take, the dosage and how has it effected you? Also what are the side effects short and long term?

1mgaa25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1mgaa25/why_most_of_bakeries_cafesrestaurants_open_quite/,Why most of bakeries/ cafes/restaurants open quite late in the UK?,"I have lived in Yorkshire for over 10 years now. There is hardly anywhere you can grab an early breakfast or coffee (I am talking about independent places, not chains or supermarkets). Most cafes and restaurants open at 9 or 10. Not to even mention anything that would be available at 8. Same with artisan bakeries, you need to wait until 9 or 10 to get fresh sourdough or pastry.
Why is that?
I am an early bird, that's a fact, but it is really a shame you can't have an early walk or hike and treat yourself after. 
And it's the same in the Lakes, Northumberland or Cornwall that I visited.
I come from Poland and most bakeries open at 6 so you can get some fresh before setting off for work or on the way to school. It's the same when being on holidays in southern Europe.

1mga5pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1mga5pe/we_built_our_own_damn_job_referral_network_for/,We built our own damn job referral network. For Berkeley only!,"TL;DR  
We built the career and job referrals network UC Berkeley should’ve had. And it’s live now.

The truth is, referrals get you jobs. Cold applying gets you ghosted.  
And the Berkeley Career Center won’t do shit about it....

So we stopped waiting and built something that actually works:  
**Golden Bear Job Referrals & Career Connections Discord**

It’s a private Discord for UC Berkeley alumni and students to help each other get jobs... through **real internal referrals**, **resume reviews**, and **no-bullshit advice** from people who’ve actually done it.

We launched a [early access version](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1l9b0vk/starting_a_referral_resume_support_discord_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) earlier in June'25. Almost 1,000 Bears joined, word of mouth only. Now we’re officially opening it... starting with alumni and new grads. (Current student will come later.)

**We already have referrals available for these companies (50+):**  
Accenture, Anthropic, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Nvidia, Meta, Databricks, Lyft, Epic Systems, SpaceX, Twitch, Google, Roche, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and more.  
And Yes! These are real Cal alumni, working there now, who can refer you internally. No fake hype. No empty promises.

# If you're a Berkeley alum and can offer job referrals:

🔗 [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXUJlZCyQRzUEfKLTpPdNRWvKt6P2S2xWyDbXagHBSYqTfEQ/viewform?usp=header)

# If you're a new grad or alum looking for a job referral:

🔗 [Start here](https://discord.com/invite/F5BggJhK7S)

# 

Everyone in the server will be berkeley. edu verified. No randos. Just a chill, focused space where Berkeley students and grads can connect, review resumes fast, drop referrals fast, and move on with their lives.

No corporate BS. No fake networking. No begging strangers on LinkedIn.  
Just Berkeley people doing the best thing and  helping each other get in the door.  
If you're tired of playing the career game on hard mode... get in. We built this for us.

GO BEARS!! Appreciate every one of you who’s shown interest and support. GO BEARS!!! 💙 💛  
**Please upvote this so more alumni can see it lol. Share it to any Cal Alum you know too!**

**Why You (Yes, You) Should Join This as an Alum:**

* You remember how soul-crushing the job hunt was. That endless loop of cold DMs, ignored applications and interviews, and awkward coffee chats that go nowhere?
* **Worst case? You get laid off one day... and now you’ve got this Discord at your back. Layoffs are brutal and random. But when it happens, you’ll already be plugged into a network of Bears who’ve got your back and give you referrals, ready to return the favor. You helped them, and they’ll help you**
* Someone probably helped you... this is your chance to pay it forward
* You can make a real difference in under few minutes a week... Skim a resume or Drop a referral on your lunch break or boring meetings. That’s it
* Referring or giving honest feedback to Berkeley students can change their entire career
* You can stay totally anonymous if you want in the discord
* You’ll wish this existed when you were job hunting. This is what we all needed back then — and now we get to build it.
* You’ll never get a cold LinkedIn DM here. **No “Hi, hope you’re doing well…” nonsense.** That energy is dead.
* This isn’t some corporate career group. No “let’s grab coffee” energy
* You don’t need to “mentor.” You just need to be real. Say “your resume sucks and needs work” or “I can’t refer you yet” ... that kind of honesty is more valuable than any coffee chat.
* You were lost, stressed, and under-qualified once too. Don't forget what it felt like to need a hand and not know where to ask.
* You don’t have to be a career coach, just be a human who remembers the grind.
* No one's selling anything. It’s literally just a bunch of Cal students and grads trying to make job hunting suck less
* It’s Berkeley-only (No randoms from the internet)
* You’re probably already scrolling Discord or Reddit during work anyway",63,1754194974.0,berkeley,6,0.92,False

But every day, I still see lots of coffee shops (during daytime), bars (during nighttime), public parks, and other potential social gathering places that are relatively cheap and a short driving, if not walking, distance from people's homes.

I think the growth of social media, streaming, and remote work have far greater effects on people's social lives and their decreased potential to meet new people and make new friends. It's a continuation of the argument Robert Putnam made about TV in his book ""Bowling Alone"" (although I do recognize that the Internet provides far more connective capabilities than TV).
