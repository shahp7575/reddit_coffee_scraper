I had been working on a big report for several days—a really detailed project with a mix of printed data, handwritten notes, and diagrams. It was one of those assignments where everything needed to be perfect, and I’d already put in hours of work.

On the day I was finalizing everything, my coworker—let’s call him Alex—came over to my desk to ask me something. He was holding this giant cup of coffee and talking animatedly, waving his hands around. I don’t even know how it happened, but before I could react, he knocked his coffee over.

It spilled all over my desk, completely drenching the report I’d printed out and destroying my handwritten notes. It wasn’t just a small spill either—it was a disaster. The coffee soaked through multiple pages and turned the entire thing into a soggy mess.

Alex immediately started apologizing and said, “Oh no, I’m so sorry! It was an accident!” I get that accidents happen, and I didn’t yell or anything, but I was visibly upset. I told him this was a ton of work that I now had to redo. He apologized again but didn’t offer to do much beyond saying, “Let me know if I can help.”

Since I had to start from scratch on a lot of it, I asked Alex if he could help me retype some of the notes or stay late to help me recreate what was lost. Alex kind of hesitated and then said something like, “I’m really busy today, but I can try to help later if I have time.” That response really frustrated me because his mistake cost me hours of extra work, and I felt like he should’ve taken more responsibility for fixing it.

I ended up redoing the whole thing myself, but it was exhausting and stressful, especially since I had to push back another project to make time for this. I haven’t said anything else to Alex about it, but the whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth.

Am I wrong for expecting Alex to step up and help fix the mess he caused, even if it was an accident? Or should I just let it go because accidents happen?",1,1735778499.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

# But Behold, a New, Experimental God

**\[Recording - Evidence From a Gas Station, 11.9 Miles Near Pineways\]**

**Nick Kerry:** “We’d like to buy all this, please.” *He carries groceries, and places them on the cashier’s desk.* *A newscast plays softly over the background.*

**Cashier:** “Alright, let me check that out.” *He scans the barcodes.* “Windy day, eh?”

**Nick Kerry:** “Right. Can we just get on with it? I,” *he eyes a car outside, where the fugitive known as CLARISSA WEYHOUND is waiting,* “need to be going.”

**Cashier:** “Right-on! That’ll be a 105, please. Cash, card, or blood?”

**Nick Kerry:** “I’ve already paid.”

**Cashier:** “What?”

**Nick Kerry:** *The sigils inscribed on his skin shift.* “I’ve already paid.”

**Cashier:** “Oh! I must’ve forgotten. You hear about that fugitive? Nick or whatever- stay safe, okay?”

**Newscast:** “Displayed here is the image of the fugitives Nick Kerry and Clarissa Weyhound. If you see, hear, or receive any information on them do not hesitate to contact the Department of Justice.”

**Cashier:** “Hey, you look just like him!”

**Nick Kerry:** “No I don’t.”

**Cashier:** *He raises a pistol from underneath the desk.* “Stay right there!”

**Nick Kerry:** *Sighs.* “Might as well.” *He drops the groceries. He looks at the cashier.* “Drop the gun.” *The cashier drops the gun.*

**Cashier:** “What the hell? I’m gonna tell the cops, I’m gonna-”

**Nick Kerry:** *Slides over a knife.* “Pick up the knife.” *He does.* “Praise your name, muse of the blind, that Eyeless Scribe.” *The markings shift upon him.* 

**Cashier:** “Okay, please- I won’t tell, just go, please.”

**Nick Kerry:** “It’s too late for that. Raise the blade to your mouth. Cut off your tongue. Praise be the muse of the voice.” 

**Cashier:** *Raises it.* “No, no, no-” *coughs, and NICK KERRY takes the tongue, and the sigils of the EYELESS SCRIBE emerge.* 

**Nick Kerry:** “I pledge this sacrifice in your name, great Scribe. Remove your eyes. Lay bleeding, and die.”

🝓 *- Agent Mabel Song*

I pause the video. I’ve seen enough, and I close out the department app. I’m on the right track, and I’m on the scene of recent sacrifice, police from the border town of Pineways on-scene.

I sigh. It’s far too early to deal with this, and I haven’t had coffee in two days. I haven’t had a meal sit right with my stomach since the encounter with the angel and its shaman the days before.  
  
There’s an early fog here, and sighing after taking a drink that’s just too cold, I exit my vehicle. The Pineways police department are all over the scene like rats to a corpse, chattering and shaking their heads.  
  
“Miracles Division,” I introduce, flipping up my identification. “Mabel Song.”  
  
An officer greets me. “Arby’s right over there.” She points over to a moustached man at least a decade older than me poring over the corpse in the center of the gas station.  
  
“Mabel Song,” I introduce, extending a hand. 

He shakes it, takes a swig of his thermos- and I can smell sweet coffee. “Arby Sayer,” he replies. “You have all the resources of the Pine district at your service.”

“Oh,” I gasp, “really?” Usually there’s a lot more pushback whenever I’m in the outer territories, especially this far up near the border.

“Yeah, why?” Arby affirms. 

“Usually there’s a lot more pushback,” I confess, shrugging. “I had to deal with a case in *Maiqiyun* up north of the city and I could swear the local authorities were working against me.”

He lets me through the tape and I’m looking at the body. “Like I said, anything you need.”  
  
The body is less organized that the sacrifice I’d encountered earlier. “Do you happen to have any spare coffee?” I request, and surprisingly, Arby shouts at an officer, and produces a cup.  
  
It tastes novel. “Hazelnut coffee, a Pineways classic.”  
  
I direct the attention back at the case. “The sacrifice itself should be typical, especially since we have video feed,” I consider.  
  
“How does he compel people to do things?” Arby asks. “I’ve never seen any god quite like it.”  
  
“Journalism god,” I answer, “usually there’s regulations and dampeners on how much they can compel and suggest people to answer. But out here and on the run- this makes it more of a threat.”  
  
“Interesting,” Arby remarks, “I’ve had what little headphones we have distributed to the men. Anything else we should watch for? What about the woman?”  
  
Ah. I’d almost forgotten there were two of them on the run. “Clarissa Weyhound. We think she engineered the Miracle attacks. Worshipper of Mae’yr- the extremist sect, the one that wants a total crusade.”  
  
“My officers are posted at every possible road to the border we can think of,” Arby informs, nodding. He e-mails me a map with every location of his people being tracked. They’re about thirty minutes away, in and around the town of Pineways. “I have them in groups of three, some of them with \*hellhounds\*.”  
  
“Satisfactory,” I compliment. “Tell them to shoot to injure on sight. We cannot let them cross the border. We will prevent an international incident.”  
  
Arby relays the message. He gets confirmation, and his people on the app begin to check in, each group popping up a notification with a message regarded text. All except one group. “Mason, your team hasn’t replied,” he states, then repeating again.  
  
There’s no response from his device. I check the vitals option of the officers. “Looks like they’re still alive.” We rule out bad signal- all our transmitters are consecrated to prevent loss of signal. “Weird.”

Arby notices something I don’t. “Their vitals are all exactly the same.” And they are, each heartbeat and status exactly at the same number, only hovering and changed by mere decimals. “Something’s happened.”

I tap on the map and zoom in. “We need to get there- now. Where is this?” 

“Winifred’s Mark,” Arby tells, examining the map. “It’s where the pines meet the field, just past Pineways. From there it’s about an hour’s walk to the border.”

“Let’s go- now!”

Arby takes four of his officers from the scene and he gets into his car. I follow in mine close behind, and we race to the scene, speeding way over the speed limit. We arrive in record time, half of the thirty minutes it should have legally taken us.  
  
But these times call for despearate measure. We park on the side of the road, and we enter the pine.   
  
“Okay, ready yourself,” Arby murmurs. “We’ll fan out.”  
  
Me and Arby stick together, and the four split into groups of two. We trace the dots on the map quietly, and we approach our objective. The sun is rising, casting glass shards of light against our field of vision.  
  
Arby strays out a hand, and we stop. “The ridge- up ahead.” I see it- there’s a man on the ridge, the man Arby knows to be Mason. He has his pistol in hand, and he’s looking at our direction.  
  
The ridge separates the pine forest from the fields, and the golden field provides a stark contrast. “He’s not moving,” I comment, “he’s been frozen.”  
  
“I have Mason on sight,” Arby informs, speaking into the communicator. “Agent, how do we proceed?”  
  
I check back to the map. The other two are somewhere nearby. “Approach your officer- I’ll cover you if he tries anything.”  
  
“Please, don’t kill him,” he prompts, and I nod.   
  
So Arby walks through the brush, and I aim my gun. I switch out the experimental bullet for a more precise, seeker kind. “Mason!”Arby shouts. “You okay-”  
  
Mason practically swivels before I can react and fires. Arby jumps back in time and I shoot- the bullet striking his knee- and yet, he stands. My position’s been uncovered- and he fires again, and again.  
  
“Over here!” Arby shouts, and I jump behind the rock he’s taking cover in.   
  
I watch Mason speak into his transmitter, and it shows up on our phones. “Team, I have sight of the terrorists- I’m on the ridge- I just shot at the two of them.”  
  
“What the hell?” Arby swears, looking back at him.  
  
I see two other figures approach Mason, and I see them converse. “They’ve been compelled,” I realize, “Nick’s convinced them the police are the terrorists they’re looking for.”  
  
Arby tells his officers to come to our aid. And then, before they move- the three officers on the ridge begin to fire- and the latter two begin to walk down. I fire two times, but they ignore the pain of the bullet, brainwashed.  
  
“Arby- how good are you at physical combat?” I ask.  
  
Arby shoots at a branch, trying to stop their advance. “Quite good, why?”  
  
“Your officers,” I check the map, “aren’t going to get here before they kill us. I can shoot the guns out- and then you need to fight them while I take out Mason.”  
  
“Understood.”  
  
And the plan is set, I burst off, then turn, aim and fire twice. Arby launches himself from the brush and tackles the two hypnotized officers. Mason aims at Arby- but I fire back at him- though the sunlight is too bright for me to aim.  
  
He starts shooting at me now, but I have tricks up my sleeve. I engage a card from my pocket with a sigil inscribed on it. I crush the seal and blood leaks into it- then I toss it at the shooter.  
  
The card explodes in light, and I take the distraction to leap up the small ridge and tackle Mason. His gun goes flying- so does mine- but I have him. He fights, and while I attack- it does nothing, he has been convinced pain is not real.  
  
I can’t win this- he’s a lot bigger than me. But I have an idea- I reach for the experimental god’s bullets and push them against his skin- and that’s enough.  
  
The blood touches it and it’s done- he breaks out of the spell and screams, the pain now finally affecting him. I should have thought of this earlier. I turn to Arby who is, despite all odds, is managing to hold his ground.  
  
I have an idea. An experimental one.  
  
I take another sigil-card out of its casing and break the seal with the god-bullets, crumpling it around the metal. I toss it downwards, and it explodes in- silence.  
  
The effect is as intended, crossing the silent deity and whatever god’s in use to produce the flash cards. The two officers drop to their knees, in pain, Arby looks at me with a question in his eye.  
  
I turn back to Mason, find a first aid card, snap and fold it in two, and place it on him. Moments later, I offer the same treatment for the other two officers, on Arby, then onto myself.  
  
Relief hits me as the blessing begins to operate, healing my wounds and making me feel \*good.\* I can see why people get addicted to the stuff- a highly intoxicating blend of some pleasure-angel and ground-up bones of a saint.  
  
We gather the three together, and Arby’s officers arrive soon after. Arby fills them in. I question the recovering trio.  
  
“The man told us he was an agent,” Mason explains, wincing at the healing, “and he said there were terrorists than were coming. I don’t know why we believed him.”  
  
“God of Journalism,” I answer. “Usually makes people more gullible. You three are lucky he didn’t sacrifice you. Do you remember where went.”  
  
One of the officers points over beyond, into the fields. “Do you think they could’ve crossed the border,” Arby asks, wondering aloud.   
  
“Where’s the nearest border station?” I ask, and Arby locates it on the map. It’s only a short distance. “Unless they’re poking a hole in the warding wall,” I reason, “Nick’s going to compel the guard to let him cross.”  
  
“Let’s go after them,” Arby decides, getting up.  
  
A thought forms in my mind- I cannot let them cross the border. I cannot let them cause an international incident. Because once they’re over the border- we’re going to have to notify Tanem’s own department of justic.

And if the two of them- radical Machiryans cause trouble across the border- the blame comes down to us and that’s a whole international incident. And my superiors have ordered me to ensure no international incidents happen.

“Stay here, in case they come back,” I order. “I’m going after them.” 

Arby nods, and he tells me to wait. He beckons for a hellhound to come over, and he feeds the recent smell of the encounter to the dog. “If he’s within a ten mile radius, Sunny will find them.”

“Thank you.”

And the two of us are off. Sunny leads me through the fields, bounding. She’s on the trail- they’re nearby.

And then I see them, right outside a border station. “Stop!” I declare. And then I fire, two shots.

Nick manages to get out of the way- but the other shot hits Clarissa right on her chest, and she falls, clutching at the wound. Nick fires back, but drop down into the fields.   
  
The dog rushes through and leaps at Nick, beginning to maul him. I get up and run- and Nick is struggling- but then shoots the dog, and she yelps, falls over, and dies. I aim at the terrorist.  
  
“Lower the gun,” he orders- but it doesn’t work. I’m wearing the headphones, and they filter out the effects of his voice. “Drop it.”   
  
“It’s over, Nick,” I snarl. It’s- and then he fires before I can finish, and I’m too surprised to react. The bullet grazes me and I yelp- and he takes the opportunity to rush me, knocking me to the ground.  
  
The headphones come off. I slam my fist into his face, and he topples over. “Stop!” Nick orders, and I feel physically unable to hit him. “Good. Raise your gun to your head.”  
  
But I’ve planned for this. I crush my left hand, and the healing spell rushes through me- complete with experimental god-bullet. I raise my gun at Nick, “Not this time-” and I fire, and a the bullet lodges itself, as he tumbles to avoid it, somewhere in his ribs.   
  
“In the name of Machiryo Bay, you’re under arrest,” and I scramble to find my handcuffs.  
  
And then a crane, ablaze, attacks me. Clarissa Weyhound is injured, but she’s using what last energy she has to conjure up the construct. I’m burned and I scream, and I set my sights on Clarissa.  
  
“Go!” she shouts, and Nick hears her, and he’s rejuvenated. “I’ll hold her off!”  
  
Nick says soemthing- convinces himself he’s not in pain and gets up. I try to aim- but the Crane strikes at me, burning me again- but for the healing spell to cure me. I fire again and again- but Nick passes by her, gives her a look, and speaks to her.  
  
I fire- the bullet hits again. She’s immune. I fire at the crane- and it dissolves. She launches a knife at me, and I dodge it- and then a burning flock of tiny birds. I fire twice, and yet she persists.   
  
“Stop or I’ll have to kill you!” I growl. But she doesn’t. “Please! Stop! There’s nothing you can do-”  
  
I get closer- and she takes the final step for me. She invokes the name of her god Mae’yr and casts the sacrifice upon herself. And then she’s being transformed, exarchified- into an angel.   
  
But I’m done with it. I ready the experimental bullet- and fire.  
  
The halfway angel disintegrates. I rest myself, kneeling, panting. I look around for the other terrorist. He’s gone.  
  
I set up an emergency line to my superiors. “This is,” I pant, tired, “Agent Song of the Miracles Division. Clarissa Weyhound is dead. But I believe,” I look to the border station in the distance, a moments walk away, “Nick Kerry has crossed the border.”  
  
A moment passes. There’s static- and then a voice. “We cannot be held accountable if he causes an incident on the Tanem side. Cross the border. Find and kill him before this devolves further.”  
  
“Okay,” I answer. “How do I proceed. What’s the role I have to play?” 

There’s a pause, and a room of people argue. “You’re not going with an identity,” the voice begins, “it would cause too much attention if you’re found to be an agent tasked with hunting one of our own. You’re going to cross the border illegally, and neutralize the target.”

“How do I do that?”

There’s talk again, and then a new voice makes her way, a voice I’ve sure I’ve heard on the radio, someone from Sacred Dynamics. Gwen Kip, was it? “I’m sending you the sigils of the experimental god we’ve given you. We’ve tested this before- find a quiet spot on the warding wall and draw the marks onto a piece of paper, then splatter it with blood.”

I understand. “What do you mean we’ve tested this before?” I question. The marks pop up on my phone.

“Doesn’t matter,” the original voice shoots back, “is your task understood?”

I sigh. “I understand.”

So that’s how it is then. It’s time to cross the border. It’s time to kill a man.

\*\*Prophet Lark: “\*\*Hey.”

**Orchid Harrow:** “Hello? What are you doing here- you’re not, you aren’t here to kill me, are you? Because my office is recorded all day.”

**Prophet Lark:** “No, I’m not. I just, I want to know how you do it. I just, I want to say I respect your position and despite what I’ve said in the past, I think you’re an inspiration somewhat.”

**Orchid Harrow:** “Uh… alright? Look Prophet, we’re running against each other, so you must have a reason for being here.”

**Prophet Lark:** “I don’t,” *she breathes deeply,* “I don’t want to run. I never wanted to run. I just want to bring people back into the faith and drive us towards a future that isn’t how it is now. We’re sacrificing people for the blessings, but we don’t put effort towards our sacrifices, towards *why* we sacrifice.”

**Orchid Harrow:** “You don’t want to run? That’s pretty big for someone on the radio who calls for fighting for faith and freedom after the miracle.”

**Prophet Lark:** “My aide writes the scripts, I don’t mind it- at least, I thought I didn’t. I’ve never cared for politics, please. I want to teach people of the Riversky path and her teachings. The values of pursuing what you want to believe, despite it all. Josie- my aide, told me going on the radio shows is a boost to the temple I run, the people I take up as prophet for.”

**Orchid Harrow:** “Then resign. What’s stopping you?”

**Prophet Lark:** “It’s too late in the cycle to resign- and Josie- she won’t let me. I asked her, I told her- but she tells me it’s for the good of the people. I don’t want to do this and I don’t have anyone else to talk to. I know I don’t know you but- I respect your cause. While I would prefer the New Faiths burned and reduced- I can empathize with your idea of less, more respectful sacrifice.”

**Orchid Harrow:** “Okay. So what? You want to lose on purpose? Just post something too faithy on social media.”

**Prophet Lark:** “I, uh, don’t know how to use social media. Josie does everything for me and- I just, I can’t with her. I can’t trust her anymore. She really wants me to happen but-” *the prophet begins to cry.* 

**Orchid Harrow:** “Prophet, are you okay?”

**Prophet Lark:** “I really don’t know. I had to do something terrible- no, someone terrible was done- to me? I just. I don’t want to win this- Josie, really, because I can’t. I just want to bring people into the faith but she’s already drawing up plans for councilor in case I win, plans I want no part it that are too political.”

**Orchid Harrow:** “Look I don’t know how I can help you. Your stunt on Baron All the other day wiped out all my gains in the northern suburbs. But it looks like your assistant is the problem- why don’t you just get rid of her and get a new one?”

**Prophet Lark:** “Because I can’t. I don’t have anyone else in my life. She’s been my friend since childhood- the elders say every prophet must have a rock, and she was my rock- until, well, I don’t want to talk about it. But the faithful who come up and ask for my blessings, my help only see me as a messenger of god, not as a person. Not someone they can go out and befriend. And it’s hard for me- I’ve never been a people person- but I don’t want to be alone.”

**Orchid Harrow:** “This is a lot, Prophet. But I think I’m starting to understand you better. I think-”

**Josie Koski:** “Prophet? Prophet! I’ve been looking for you!”

**Prophet Lark:** *Sighs sadly.* “I really have to go now but please, please talk to me. I don’t have anyone else and I need something. Please. I’ve seen your shows, your broadcasts- I respect you.” *Walks away.*

**Orchid Harrow:** “That was… interesting. Poor kid.”

*☈ - Cameron Bell*

I have not seen daylight in a few weeks now. I’ve gotten the hang of counting the days- some of the other misfortuned prisoners in the labor camp have developed a system. The temple guards change every three hours, and it is by that metric they count the days.

Everyone is reserved, quiet, but they all share a bond, a form of camaraderie that’s communicated in the deep silence of the empty. We murmur and sing quietly, consecrating the goods and feeding the angel gears of an industry powered by real human sacrifices.  
  
Every moment spent is a sacrifice to my potential. Every brick, mortar, and stone consecrated are seconds of my future offered up to a god I do not know. I wonder, as I read the pages and make holy a river of oil, how many years my life will be cut short, offered up to an alien god or angel.  
  
I have seen it happen.   
  
It was about a week ago. I don’t know the woman’s name, but I do know from what whispers I’ve heard is that she’d been imprisoned, carted off from one Gospel-Pyramid to another for ages and years.  
  
She consecrated the running, thick, oil- and then it happened. She’d sacrificed her final minute, her time sacrificed in the future finally reaching out for her.  
  
The God that took her was one I recognized. Of all things, it was something small. A god of taxi cabs and transportation. Our city’s deity of the subways. Of all things, it was a god of the goddamn train station. Not some oil god, not some construction deity.  
  
It started with the sounds. She’d begun to hear the sounds of the railway, the subway, the great public transit of the city. And then she began to see the Signal-Angle, a light in the distance, getting closer, and closer.  
  
She begged and prayed for an extension- even begging the guards to find another sacrifice in her place, someone else to take. But what can those deprived of anything do?  
  
She gasped her last- and her body began to twist, contort on its own. The sacrifice was self made. Autosacrifice, a contract to a god finally fulfilled.   
  
Her skin folds and rivets into a perfect, human map of the rail system, depicting the moving, live locations of every single train in the Machiryo metropolitan area. And then she gasps, and it's as if a train hits her- and then she bursts into flames- and she’s gone.   
  
It happened so fast. I don’t think it hurt. I suppose that’s one mercy I may have coming for me- stars above know I’ve used the transit systems many times.   
  
This method of supposedly painless autosacrifice has been so effective the old Cathedral of the Locomotive has been shut down. I remember it being a pretty big deal a very long time ago.  
  
All the scriptures, all the saint’s relics moved into a storage unit attached to the headquarters of the Machiryan Transit Authority. There’s no need for singing praise and chosen sacrifice anymore.   
  
It’s a fact of business, I suppose. A transition from an Old God to a New God. It’s no longer ‘what does this represent? How can we get there on time?’ to ‘How many \*other\* people can we get there on time?’, ‘How can we expand?’.  
  
I suppose it’s how it is. We all pay a tax to the transit authority- it is government sponsored. It’s about a minute of our future time a year.  Not much, but it adds up. I think about what I can do with a minute of my time.  
  
I could sacrifice that false-faith justice agent. I could get a good, truly decent dinner. I’m hungry. They don’t feed us very well.

There’s a man I come to know a bit better, a man that sticks out among the others. He has the same tattoo that we all have, the experimental god that nullifies any chance of us attempting to utilize our own gods.

But he also has the tattoos of an apple tree. He’s a member of the Free Orchard, I think. But he’s more than that. 

He’s a storyteller. A small group of people, friends, mostly, but occasionally, I observe, strangers gather around him after the work is done in the common areas of our sleeping quarters.

He sings and tells folk stories, stories I had never heard of. He’s sweet, and he tries his best to uplift the mood.

I approach him after. I gesture to his tattoo. “You’re a member of the cause.” I comment.

His eyes widen, and he shakes his head. “No, not anymore.”

“What do you mean?” I ask. “Are you not one of the Orchard?”

He steps back. “You,” he’s nervous now, and he’s jittery, “really can’t say that around here. And please- especially not around me.”

An old man interrupts us. He looks like he’s bound do be claimed any day now. “Ha!” he laughs. “Boy thinks he’s still gonna get out of here!”

“I will, Leon, I will,” Paul promises, waving his hand to shoo him away. “My rehearing’s in a few days. I’ve worked enough here.”

“What do you mean?” I inquire, curious.

“Don’t you know?” I tell Leon I’m new. “We aren’t getting out!” he shouts. 

Paul shrugs. “I’m a model prisoner,” he affirms. “I plan on getting out.”

“That’s what you said two months ago!” Leon argues, laughing as he does, laughing at the inevitably of it all. “That’s what you said a year ago!”

“Leon, I can feel it,” Paul snaps, anxiously laughing, “this time, for sure.”

“I don’t understand,” I comment, confused. “What do you mean we aren’t getting out.”

Paul gives the elder a look. “Leon- don’t you *dare-*”

But to my benefit, Leon goes blabbering on either way. “Paul’s served twice his sentence,” he informs, quietly. Paul sighs and remains quiet. “What is it you did?”

“You met Nick?” Paul questions. I nod, and I explain how I got involved. “He does that. He finds people that are angry. That Journalist-God really helps you get convinced of it all.”

This was true. “But I believe in the cause. The New Gods have gone too far- and with or without Nick, I would’ve done *something.*”

“That’s what everyone says,” Paul posits, sitting down on a bench. “We all say we’re going to act. We’re going to shoot an executive. We’re going to fight for change. But we don’t. It’s not that we’re scared. It’s just a lot. So much stress already, all the time. But Nick?”

“Yeah?”

“Nick’s determined. I don’t know if its him, or his god, but he makes things happen. His god doesn’t force people to do anything- it just raises the questions they want answered, makes them speak. And once you say something out loud, you can’t really put it back inside, can you?”

“This is,” I murmur, “true. So why are you here? And what do you mean you’ve served twice your sentence?”

Paul scratches his chin. Leon rests a hand on his shoulder for assurance. “Let me be clear- I don’t blame Nick. I would’ve tried either way.” He sucks in a deep breath. “Pipeline sabotage.”

Leon cuts in. “*Attempted* pipeline sabotage.”

“Yes, well, you don't have to rub it in, old boy,” he shakes his head in joking annoyance, “but I’m glad. Makes my sentence lighter.” I’ve heard of this- an extremist team arrested attempting to blow up one of the outer oilfields in the Grace. There was a small firefight- two died on each sides. “The others are in the other prisons. I dunno what happened to them- last I heard Nash got sacrificed.”

“My condolences,” I offer.

“I didn’t really know them well. I suppose you don’t know the others in Kerry’s group. Benefits of a decentralized network. You can’t kill an ideology. But I’ve been good. I can feel it. They’re going to let me out soon.”

“That’s the hope fairies talking, kiddo,” Leon jests. “He’s served twice his sentence and every time his appeal comes around it’s always a month or two more. It never ends.”

“Don’t you see?” I hiss. “They’re suppressing us. Leon- why are you here- how long?”

He shrugs. “It’s been too long,” he whispers, “my daughter must be all grown up now. I wonder if she’s a professor. She always wanted to do that.”

“He used to work for the subway, before it expanded,” Paul explains, “he was part of the union that went on strike. One of many protesters arrested. I’m surprised the old man hasn’t been god-claimed yet.”

“No god’s claiming me yet!” Leon shouts, defiant. It comes out of nowhere. He looks at my face and laughs. “I suppose, maybe, they forget about me. Even gods have clerical errors.” He laughs a bit, but he sighs after. “I’m tired of this. But there’s nothing better to do- come on Paul, tell us a story.”

“Not now,” Paul decides. “I need to prepare for my hearing.” He steps away to return to his cell, but he pauses, and turns to me. “Don’t bring up the Free Orchard. Those days are past me.”

He walks away. “He says that,” Leon begins, “but he wants to fight back. All his stories are the folk kind. The kind that tells you to reject the false and fight for your rights.” he starts listing off stories now. “The \*Crane Devouring,\* the \*Quail on the Rock,\* the \*Princess and the Shepherd.\*” he sighs. “He’s too optimistic. But the stories are his way of fighting back, whether he knows it or not.”  
  
“Do they really keep us here forever?” I ask, worried.  
  
He shrugs. “There was a woman once, she left,” he begins. He sighs. “Turns out she was transferred up a level up the prison. She was transferred back two years later, and then an angel took her. Some obscure god of the old country, the ones you pray to when you’ve got nothing left. She turned into some monster- made everyone hungry. Ever since then they’ve strengthened security from standard dampening sigils to experimental ones.”  
  
I take a moment to process it. “So this is it, then?” I ask. “Is it over?”  
  
“Maybe,” Leon murmurs, wrinkling his face. “We live on in our own ways.”  
  
Leon yawns, and decides to head off to bed. I think about it a while, and I do the same. I attend Paul’s story the next day- he tells a tale I’m unfamiliar with, a tale he says was told by one of his cousins as a child across the border. 

A tale about a Quail God. It satisfies me. The vengeance of the angel’s prophet is one I hope to wreak upon my enemies. I get to know Paul a little bit better. Not by much though, but I do know one thing: he’s hopeful.

Two days pass. Paul goes for his appeal. His sentence is extended by a month. The last time, they claim. No reason offered. Leon isn’t surprised.

There’s something in his eyes now, something in the way his stories are changing. He tells a different version of the Quail on the Rock. This time, the Prophet kills the final prophet of the Salamander. 

“You coming here,” he says, approaching me during mealtime, “is a sign. I’ve stayed here thinking it’ll be fair long enough. And to think of it- I would’ve cooperated, stopped, been placated if they’d let me go.”

“What are you thinking?” I ask, in between bites of turkey.

“You’ve reminded me,” he starts, “that the Free Orchard is still out there. That means the problem isn’t fixed yet. That means,” he sighs, as if his thoughts are not yet fully formed, “I still have work to do. And I’ve reached my limit.”

“So what are you going to do?” Leon asks. “Kid, I’ve been telling you this for ages.”

“I know, Lee,” he groans. “I don’t know what I’m going to do. But it’s going to be a folktale one day. I’m going to show the people to fight, is to be remembered.”

“An industrial god will not wipe out the memories of our people,” I affirm. “They  are a blight on this earth.”

“I suppose so,” Paul agrees, hesitant, still wanting to believe, deep down, that he could stop, go back to work, and hope to be freed. But he shakes his head. “I have faith.”",2,1735778307.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

Where do I start?

Back in 2022 I (22F, at that time was 20) started seeing this guy Z I worked with. We went out on a couple of dates, all was going well. One day we slept together and in the morning, I know I was acting weird but I was so on guard from previous times that he was going to completely lose interest after we slept together. After I leave I then do kind of shut down for the next couple of days waiting for the moment he tells me he’s no longer interested - so I understand I didn’t deal with things correctly here. Well well well, three days later he lets me know that he doesn’t think we are the right match. 

Two months later he’s in a relationship. 

My issue is, I’ve never been as infatuated and seemingly “into” someone since him. Like I would genuinely be imagining our life together and we weren’t ever even officially together. 

Since then I’ve been out with a few people but even ended things because I don’t feel my feelings are developing at all. 

Recently I met someone called A (24m) and we live about 2.5hrs apart so don’t get to see each other much. But he’s never been in a relationship before so I think he’s very eager for this to turn into one. I do like him a lot and we get on but the thing that’s holding me back is I feel he lacks a lot of motivation which is really important to me. He even asked me to be official and I said I want to get to know him better first so things aren’t off the cards. But he’s so nice and literally tells me I’m perfect. 

Two weeks ago Z messages me catching up on what we’ve been doing, jobs, life etc and then he also says that he realises he didn’t handle things right those couple of years ago and if i can forgive him if I’d like to meet up for a coffee. 

I told him I’m seeing someone and (he was always a bit too confident) asks me how serious and that if needed he will wait for me!

I wouldn’t meet up with Z while still seeing A, but I feel now I know Z wants to see me it’s really clouding my judgement with A. Still after all these years I can safely say I’m into and attracted to Z and he has that motivation in life! But am I putting him on a pedestal? 

Do I try things properly with A and if not see Z? But I feel my judgement is always going to be bias now I know Z wants to see me again ",1,1735778296.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False

It started on January 2, when he sent me a message. At first, it was just casual talk between two strangers sharing crazy interests. I wasn’t paying much attention until I discovered he’s a huge fan of Attack on Titan—my favorite anime. From that moment, something about him drew me in, like we’d known each other forever.  

By January 4, we met for a friendly coffee date, not realizing how life-changing it would be. The moment we met, I felt this strange and wonderful feeling, like I had just found home.  

Things moved quickly, but it felt right. On January 7, just three days after our first meeting, he asked me to be his girlfriend—inside a church! That thoughtful gesture melted my heart. By February 4, I couldn’t hold back anymore. I said yes. It felt special to make it official on 02-04-2024, a Sunday, at the same church where he first asked me to be his girl.  

Now, a year later, I’m still amazed at how love found me in the most unexpected way. Who would’ve thought a random Reddit message would bring me my favorite plot twist—and the man who turned my prayers into reality. I love you so much, my wolfpup. 🤍  ",6,1735778204.0,love,1,0.88,False

I just tried one in a shop and was pretty wowed by how nice it is. A few things really jumped out:

The grind adjustment dial is so buttery smooth across the entire range and feels really well built. I stood there just rotating it back and forth for a few minutes. Makes my DF64 Gen 2 feel like a children's toy.

The burr access is SO easy. Upper burr locks into place and can be removed with a simple smooth twist. This looks like it makes cleaning and swapping burrs a breeze, and the tolerances feel really lovely and tight. No play anywhere. 

Even though it's pricey, it's cheaper than a P64 and actually seemed like really good value considering how incredibly well it's engineered.

I've also read that a ketogenic diet is the way to go, but there are certainly a number of detractors out there on keto. I'd really be interested to hear what you know in relation to sugar and cancer, and what might be suitable sugar alternatives? ",1,1735778161.0,pancreaticcancer,0,1.0,False
1hrh3b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1hrh3b9/the_world_outside_the_window/,The World Outside the Window,"I never thought I’d end up here. In this apartment. With a window that feels off. At first, I thought it was just a place to crash while I sorted my life. Freelance work. Some design projects. A little space to breathe. But the window. It was huge. Too big. And the view? Perfect. Too perfect.



I know the city. I’ve lived here long enough to know every street. Every corner. But the view? It didn’t feel right. The skyline was the same. The glass towers. The lights. But the streets? Empty. No honking. No yelling street vendors. Just stillness. Silence. Like a photograph.



The first few days, I convinced myself it was just my head. Maybe too much coffee. But the more I stared, the weirder it got. The people below weren’t walking. Not really. They were stuck. In a loop. The same woman. The same guy in the suit. Same kid. Same thing. Over. And over. They never stopped.



At first, I thought I was losing it. Maybe I was working too much. Staring too long. But every time I glanced outside, the same thing happened. And it started to creep me out. Not the people. Not the city. It was me. I felt like I was the glitch. Out of place.



It wasn’t real, I told myself. I couldn’t help but stare. No matter how hard I tried to ignore it. Something about it called me. Like I was in the wrong story. Like I was waiting for it to fall apart.



It wasn’t just the people anymore. It was everything. The pigeons showed up first. Weird, right? A pigeon fluttered at the window. Staring at me. Beady eyes. I thought it was just a bird. But it didn’t feel like just a bird. It felt like it was trying to communicate. I know it sounds insane. But I swear, it seemed like it could see through me.



Then more showed up. Hundreds. On the ledge. Not moving. Just staring. At me. I thought about calling someone. But what would I say? “Hey, so... there’s a bunch of birds staring at me”? Yeah, no.



But they wouldn’t leave. They stayed. Watching.



I started to feel trapped. The more I stayed, the more I felt like I wasn’t in control. The walls seemed to close in. The air thickened. Every time I tried to get out, something pulled me back. To the window. To the city. To those people.



And then, it happened.



The reflection.



I was standing there, looking out, when I saw it. The reflection wasn’t me. It was me. But it wasn’t. Older. Eyes hollow. Hands trembling. The figure pressed its hand to the glass. Right where mine was. And it smiled.



It wasn’t a normal smile. It was wrong. Hollow. It felt like a warning. But I couldn’t move. I was glued to the spot. Staring at this thing. It looked like me. But it wasn’t.



“You’re still here,” it whispered. Its voice wasn’t real. It was my voice. But wrong. ""You opened the door. Now you’re part of me.""



I blinked. Gone. Just me. The empty city. Nothing more.



But it stayed with me. That smile. That voice.



I started digging. I had to know. If I stayed here, I felt like I’d disappear with it. The walls bent. The room felt smaller. I tried to leave. But each step felt like walking through molasses. The window kept pulling me back. It was alive. It needed me to stay.



I couldn’t stop looking. The people outside—if they were even people—stopped. Frozen. Staring. Eyes dull. Empty. Like mannequins. Stuck.



I had seen movies like this. Read stories. But this wasn’t like those. I was losing track of what was real. The more I tried to ignore it, the more the city felt like a stage. A performance. I was just a part of it. But I didn’t want to be.



Then, the reflection came back.



This time, it wasn’t a trick. It was talking.



“You know it’s too late now, don’t you?” It laughed. Same hollow laugh. Same cold eyes. “You looked. Now you’re mine.”



I couldn’t breathe. I wanted to scream. To run. But I was stuck. The window wasn’t just a window anymore. It was the city. And I was stuck in it. The more I looked, the more I realized. This wasn’t a city. It was a prison. Perfect. Hollow. A trap. And the reflection was me. Was I really in the apartment? Or was the apartment in me?



I couldn’t tell anymore.



Then, it hit me. There was no escape.



The apartment. The window. The city. None of it was real. I had created it. I built it. Out of isolation. Out of my need to stay disconnected from everything. The reflection wasn’t trying to get me to leave. It was pulling me in. Into itself. To swallow me whole.



I tried to turn away. But the reflection grinned. Its eyes stayed locked on mine.



And the window? It never stopped waiting. Perfect. Endless.



And I realized, too late, I’d never [leave](https://www.reddit.com/user/elliot-barnes/comments/1hqs24b/hi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).",1,1735778150.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

Let’s face it—kids have the energy of a caffeinated squirrel and the attention span of a goldfish. 

When you’re fresh out of ideas (or just fresh out of patience), here are 10 low-effort, zero-budget ways to keep them entertained while you sip your coffee and *pretend* you have it all together.

# 1. The ""Who Can Stay Quiet the Longest?"" Game 🤫

A classic. Just declare it a competition and watch the silence roll in like sweet, sweet music. Add a prize if needed—like bragging rights or an extra cookie.

# 2. Build a Pillow Fort 🏰

Tell them they’re architects and the couch cushions are their building blocks. Bonus: once the fort’s up, it doubles as a jail for their wild sibling (or you, hiding with snacks).

# 3. Cardboard Box Olympics 📦

Got an empty box lying around? Hand it over. Within five minutes, it’s a spaceship, a racecar, or a secret lair. The possibilities are endless—and so is your break time.

# 4. Sink or Float Science Lab ⚓

Fill a bowl with water and give them random household objects. Their job? Test which ones sink or float. You get 20 minutes of peace; they get a crash course in physics. Win-win!

# 5. Animal Charades 🐒

Tell them to act like their favorite animal while you guess (or pretend to). The catch? You have to keep a straight face while they squawk, roar, and crawl like maniacs.

# 6. Hallway Bowling 🎳

Line up water bottles in the hallway and grab a ball. Instant bowling alley! No shoes required, and the only “gutter balls” are when the toddler throws it at the wall.

# 7. Mirror My Moves 🕺

Stand in front of them and do goofy moves: wiggle, jump, wave your arms. They have to copy you. When they’re tired, let them lead while you *strategically sit down*.

# 8. The Laundry Basket Express 🚂

Plop them in a laundry basket and push them around the house while making train noises. Bonus: this counts as cardio for you!

# 9. Treasure Hunt Xpress 🗺️

Hide random objects (even socks) around the house and give them clues to find them. No time to write a list? Just call it “find everything I didn’t clean up.”

# 10. The Floor Is Lava 🌋

No setup required—just declare that the floor is lava, and suddenly every chair, couch, and table becomes a life raft. Watch them scramble like their lives depend on it.

✨ **Pro Tip:** The key to these activities? A big imagination and absolutely zero effort on your part. Your kids will have a blast, and you’ll finally get a chance to sit down (even if it’s just for five minutes).

Basically we just finished a movie together and it was about 5pm so I asked him if he wanted to go get a coffee and grab lunch because I was getting hungry, he said yes. He was laying down so I gave him 10 min after asked him if he wanted to go and he said in one more minute. 15 mins later I asked again and he said one more min, this went on for over an hour until I got a little frustrated and said “babe if you’re too tired and don’t want to go it’s ok, just tell me so I’m not sitting here waiting” because the truth is, I wouldn’t be upset if he just wanted to relax but at least let me know so I don’t ask every 10 mins if he’s ready to go you know? Just communicate 
Anyways he got upset with me and “well I keep saying one more minute cuz maybe I’ll want to go next time” I said well that’s not fair to me to wait it seems kinda inconsiderate to me (still talking nicely ) but than he went off saying he just wants to relax 
I told him that’s ok and I’m not sure why he’s upset with me I approached it nicely I don’t want that attitude 
And that’s when he said I was annoying and he didn’t want to go anymore and went to bed 
It really hurt my feelings because he made a big deal out of something that didn’t have to be, I was super frustrated with him for making me wait but still approached the situation nicely because I didn’t want to fight and he got upset. I have zero problems if he didn’t feel like getting up to grab a coffee and if he just wanted to relax and nap that’s ok but come on he didn’t have to get mad at me and call me annoying he could’ve just said he didn’t feel like going? 
Anyways after I asked him if he’s just gonna sleep the rest of the day (it’s 6pm) he said yea so I asked if he wanted me to go home and he said he doesn’t care. 
I don’t see him everyday next time I would see him would be in 3 days so I hate to leave on bad terms but it doesn’t seem like he cares and he just wants to sleep lol.

1hrgwnh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrgwnh,Not sure what to paint walls & what colour bedding should be ,"I added the second picture as it gives a better perspective of the space 

I love earthy tones but I’m struggling to find ideas on Pinterest. I want dark relaxing colours but I don’t want it to be too green! I have a few colours in mind but I’m so indecisive and my bf keeps telling me he doesn’t care so I need someone to give me their input 😭 I plan on adding some brown drawers at the sides of the bed and a brown dresser against the wall at the foot of the bed (it fits a wardrobe with space to walk). And some ceiling hanging clothes hangers above. I also plan on adding some either mustard or coffee coloured curtains (depending on the colour of the walls) and a shelf/ curtain rode to then hold some plants, personal pieces and a mood lamp. 

On the other side opposite the window and behind the bed I’m not sure. My bf is an artist so maybe some of his art work. I really want to add a tv or a projector still not 100% but if a tv not sure where 😫. Sorry for the awful pictures it’s difficult as the room is small. ",1,1735777632.0,DesignMyRoom,6,1.0,False
1hrgwmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hrgwmm/vent/,Vent ,"So I just got the confirmation today that my ex is dating the girl I suspected he was. We broke up in june… he met her not even a month later. I wanted to move on so I gave his stuff back to his friend hoping he would return mine but he never did. So in september I messaged him and he said he would give me my stuff back and asked if I wanted to meet up for a coffee and to talk. I found this weird since I knew he was seeing her, and I was not in a place yet to meet up with him so I said that I didn’t intend to meet up with him but that I would think about it. So I did, and almost a month later I said that we could meet up so he could give me my stuff. He said he would message me when he was in my city to do that.

Guess what, he never did. So I had to ask him again once and for all that he didn’t need to meet up with me, he could send it by mail or give it to a friend of mine but that I didn’t want to delay this anymore. He said that he did come to my city but forgot to bring my stuff and blah blah blah (excuses), that he wanted to talk to me but he understood if I just wanted to get it over with. 

We ended up meeting a month ago. It was really weird. I realized I didn’t love him anymore, i didn’t feel anything, except a bit uncomfortable. He, on the other hand was borderline flirting with me…He lied just to have an excuse to tell me he now has a job, asked me if I regreted the relationship  and if my family hated him. When I told him we couldn’t have any kind of relationship, even a platonic one because it would remind me of the bad things that happened he said very suprised “ of the bad ones ???”.

Why would you meet up with your ex if you have a girlfriend ? Thats just weird to me. When we broke up he said he missed me very much and would do for a very long time, well after 2/3 weeks he was already after her lol. Also said he needed to focus on himself. 
I got the ick after what I saw today, it was the kick I needed to move on forever. It hurts to feel disgust towards a person you once loved, but people show us who they are and there is nothing we can do but accept it.",1,1735777631.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1hrgvxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hrgvxr/aita_for_banning_my_fils_parents_from_ever_seeing/,AITA for banning my FIL’s parents from ever seeing our children again?,"I (33F) found out about a week before Christmas  that my FIL’s parents “diddled” him (that’s how he put it) and his older brother when they were kids. It was mentioned super casually as I was driving him home from a doctor appointment that requires a mild anesthetic, so I tried to keep that in mind, but everything we had been talking about beforehand was fairly normal, albeit a little gushier than usual, such as telling me how thankful he is for me and my family and whatnot. 
Anyways. I brought it up to my husband that night and it was really upsetting for him. He said he had suspected because his grandparents always “creeped him out” and he wasn’t allowed to be around them alone. 
I told him that we cannot allow our children (9F, 3M, 1F) around them ever again. He pushed back at first and explained how much upset that would cause and I said TOO DAMN BAD, this should have happened a lot time ago. He tried to make all these points of “they’re old” “it happened so long ago” “we don’t even know what happened” “our kids don’t need to be ALONE with them” and then I hit him with: if we DONT do this, then we are normalizing it further. Because someday, our children will find out, and whatever decisions we make around it will be the example they live by. 
He agreed. And apologized and immediately acknowledged that it’s a scary decision to make because it’s going to cause a ripple. 
We talked to my MIL and asked her if she knew anything about it. She immediately turned around, walked into the kitchen, told us to take a seat and asked if we wanted coffee or tea. After some tears, apologies, anger, and some really amazing coffee, we learned the truth which was horrifying and I won’t get into the details obviously. But we found out that my FIL’s older brother didn’t die in a car accident. He took his own life. 
That was it for me and my husband. We pulled the plug. My MIL was so upset but said she understood and would try her best to explain to her husband. We told her that wasn’t her job and that we could explain if he wanted. 
My husband didn’t have the heart to reach out, so I did it. I know some of you may have a problem with this, but if you knew us at all, you’d understand this was the best choice. I first spoke to his father and reminded him of what he had told me about being abused and he got really quiet on the phone to the point where I said “hello?” And he said “DONT. You. Ever. Tell ME that I was abused” and freaked out. Telling me I didn’t know anything and how his parents did their best and they were just young and dumb and drank a lot and hadn’t found Jesus and blah blah blah. I let him go on and on while my husband listened absolutely mortified. Once he stopped I just cut right to the chase and said “I can no longer allow your parents to see my children” and he hung up on me. 
My MIL called the next morning and said they weren’t coming to Christmas and how sorry she was. Around dinner time that day my SIL sent me this long text about how her and her husband wouldn’t be coming over either because she felt it would upset her father even more and make him feel like she was picking us. I tried calling her right after but she sent me to voicemail and I explained that it doesn’t need to be a side-picking thing at all. 
So our Christmas was just my husband and our children this year.. and though it was a good day, we really felt the emptiness. I kept telling him we made the right decision, and that peoples reactions to our boundaries don’t change the boundary we’ve laid. But I can see on my husbands face how sad he is.. and there’s a tiny piece of me that feels like I’m being this crazy control freak who just blew up my husbands entire family RIGHT before Christmas. 

So… AITA?

(Di namin alam bakit) 

Everytime na nagta-travel kami or solo laging mix yun ng booked tour at DIY (basta as long as walkable lang sya or madali lang mag commute) pero pag alam kong malayo and para maiwasan ang scam etc., nagbo-book ako lagi sa KLOOK.

So ito lang yung mga binook namin sa KLOOK/Online:

-Elephant Care (feeding,trekking,bathing)
-Wake up Call

Sa FOOD!!!
Must try ang Khao Soi nila. Ang sarap nito for me!! 

And FOR US, mas masarap talaga kumain sa nga carineeria style/street food nila kesa sa mga mahal na resto. Pero if maselan tyan nyo, sa resto na kayo para sure. 
Mura lang naman mga food sa Chiang Mai, kumain kayo sa mga kainan na makikita nyo puro locals talaga yung kumakain kesa puro tourist kasi ibig sabihin nun masarap talaga. 

Few tips and reminders:
-BOOK IN ADVANCE. Di namin akalain na mabilis ma full yung mga airbnb/hotel. Lalo na yung mga Elephant Sanctuary. Naka chamba lang kami ng 1 night.
-If gusto nyo makakita ng elephants, mas okay talaga sa mga sanctuary kasi mga rescued elephants sila. And please!! Wag nyo suportahan yung mga sinasaktan yung elephants, naka chain, sinasakyan etc. 
-Activities in Elephant Sanctiary are optional lang. Pwede naman na room lang yung i-book nyo then dun na kayo mag decide if mag avail kayo ng activities. 
-Must try talaga yung Cooking Class lalo na kung love na love nyo ang Thai Food. Magandang bonding rin with friends, jowa or kahit mag isa ka lang. SUPER NAKAKABUSOG. Luto nyo,Kain nyo. 
-Respect Locals and Be Friendly. 
-If tamad na kayo mag lakad lakad, you can book via BOLT APP/Grab. Mura lang din naman fare nila pero mas cheaper lang talaga sa BOLT. 
-TRY NYO TALAGA YUNG THAI MASSAGE. MAPAPA NEW YEAR, NEW ME kayo after! Hahahhahaa 

Ayun lang. sana naka help kami sa mga nagbabalak magpunta ng Chiang Mai this 2025!!!

1hrguri,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1hrguri/taking_flight_chapter_61_a_night_at_spudsys/,"Taking Flight, Chapter 61: A Night At Spudsy's","The roads of Bricktown have fallen silent around Spudsy's Family Diner. Tari and Rufus are taking a seat alongside Ragatha and Kinger as a noticeably bemused blonde girl comes up to their table. Her cheerful voice sounded much too forced to be genuine. 

Lizzy: Hello. Welcome to Spudsy's. May I take your order?

Tari: One Veggie Burger, please. 

Rufus: Bangers n' Mash with a side of slaw. 

Ragatha: I'll have the kosher style double hotdog with a milkshake.

Kinger: One grilled cheese, Please. 

Lizzy: Alrighty! 

Lizzy keeps up the smiles as she writes down their orders, and immediately drops the act when she's far enough away. She heads over to the front desk and hands the order over to a chill green eyed lad beside the cash register. She pulls out her phone and pulls up her Tumblr. 

Lizzy: Four orders for table three. 

Thad: Gotcha. Four more coming up, Ellis!....... Ellis?

He heads into the kitchen and finds a man-shaped mass of orbs manning the fryers.

Thad: Yo, Orbsman. You seen Ellis? 

Orbsman: [HE SAID HE HEARD SOMETHING IN THE BACK ROOM AND WENT TO TAKE A LOOK.]

Thad: Well, could you take over for a sec? We got 4 more orders.

Orbsman: [WILL DO, SIR.]

The ring of a bell signals two new customers, Uzi and Noah, come inside. Kinger is the first to notice.

Noah: Hey Kinger! 

Kinger: Oh! Fancy seeing you guys here.

Uzi just casually smirks as the two make their way to an adjacent table. That's when Tari notices a familiar white suited gentleman come in, accompanied by another familiar young man. She immediately recognized them both.

Tari: *gasp* PIETRO! DAMIEN!

Damien glances over to the blue haired girl shouting his name and eagerly waving at him. She hops out of her seat and hurriedly runs up to him, much to his confusion.

Damien: Oh......um, hey there!

Tari: It's great to see you again, Damien. You too, Pietro!

It took a moment to click for him. 

That's when it clicks.

Pietro: Oh. One of Damien's friends. 

Tari: Yes! We met on that cave expedition. The one with-

A leather glove swiftly clasps itself over her mouth. He speaks to her with a hushed tone.

Pietro: Yes. The one with the ruins.

He takes a quick look around. 

Pietro: No need to let EVERYONE know. Understood?

Tari nods, and Pietro retracts his hand. 

Tari: Sorry about that. It's just...... it's been a while and I was wondering what you've been up to.

Damien: Well, there isn't much on my end. Apart from the appointments, I've just been laying low and taking it easy.

Tari: That's great to hear. I'm glad you're doing well. 

Damien: As well as I can be

Tari: What about you, Pietro? Been doing anything super sneaky lately. 

Pietro: I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. 

Tari gives a little chuckle at his ""joke."" Lizzy puts on another fake smile as Pietro approaches the register. 

Lizzy: Hello, sir. Is there anything you would like to order?

Pietro: Just a coffee, light on cream. Bill it to- 

A blood curdling scream echoes from the back of the building. Tari and the others fall dead silent. Even Lizzy was somewhat surprised.

Lizzy: *sigh* Excuse me for a minute. Orbsman will arrive with your orders shortly. 

She ushers everybody back to their seats before rushing off towards the back of the building. She finds Thad with his hand on his chest and his back against the wall with the look of sheer dread on his face. 

Lizzy: Let me guess. Another spider? 

Back in the dining area, Uzi nonchalantly browses the menu while Noah tries to strike up a conversation with Pietro across the table. Damien is just staring out the window. 

Noah: So there are these symbols you'll encounter as you go through the dungeon. The symbols stay the same with each reset, so it's good to have it written down for future runs. 

Pietro: (Mon dieu, is he still going?) 

Tari and the others meanwhile are enjoying their food and striking up a conversation of their own.

Ragatha: So Tari, I heard you were invited to a friend's family reunion. 

Tari: Not exactly. There was this huge misunderstanding and we more or less ended up......... breaking into their house. Don't worry! Things got sorted out pretty quickly, though.

Rufus: Y'know, that reminds me of a time me and my parents snuck into a party once. Heh......  Turned out to be a funeral. My dad had to make up this story about how he and the guy served in the army so we wouldn't get arrested. 

That's when Tari notices something going on in the kitchen. Thad sifts past the frycooks with the look of sheer dread on his face as he returns to his station behind the register. Lizzy isn't too far behind. 

Lizzy: Just suck it up and make the announcement already.

He lightly taps the microphone. The high pitched squeek rings out from speakers across the building. 

Thad: Uh, attention all customers and staff. Within one hour, we will be closing the main dining area for cleaning and maintenance. Future orders will need to be made at the drive through, and alll current in-progress orders will be labeled as ""to go"" at no additional charge and will include a free Kid's Toy. Thank you for eating at Spudsy's, and we hope to see you again soon. 

Noah: *GASP* I didn't know they had kids toys! 

Uzi: But you're not even a kid.

Noah: Oh yeah. Maybe I can ask for an adult toy instead? 

The comment got a chuckle out of Damien and nearly made Pietro choke on his coffee. Tari wasn't laughing. She could feel something wasn't right. Ragatha had the same feeling, and even Kinger was a bit off-put by the announcement. Out back, a bemused Lizzy watches a frantic Thad pace back and forth in a panic. 

Thad: Okay. This.......this is really bad. Really. Really. REALLY bad. I don't know about you, but I did NOT sign up for this! I'M FREAKING OUT, MAN!

She gives him a slap across the face.

Lizzy: Get a hold of yourself, you dunce! Panicking isn't gonna fix anything. 

Thad: We need to call the cops. 

Lizzy: And have them close down the only job we could find in this dump? 

Thad: THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO!?

Lizzy: Quiet! The last thing we need is people overhearing this! 

Thad: Right!..... Sorry. 

Lizzy: *sigh* Look. Here's what we're gonna do. You simply just man the drive thru and give us cover while I go grab the manager. Absolutely NO ONE is to suspect anything wrong.

Kinger: Why not? 

The two jump at the sight of Kinger just standing there beside them.

Lizzy: Excuse me, what the hell are you doing here!?

Kinger: I heard you guys from upfront. It sounded like you two need a little help.

Lizzy: THAT'S COMPANY BUSINESS, NOW SCRAM!

Lizzy acts fast as she pushes Thad towards the backdoor. Ragatha and Tari arrive just as Lizzy slams the door behind her, followed by the clicks of various locks and pins to make sure it STAYS shut. 

Tari: Huh....... I wonder what that was all about. 

Ragatha: Yeah, me too. 

Back inside, Lizzy shoves Thad over to the Drive Thru window as she makes her way into the main office. A middle aged man sits behind the desk with a glass of Jack Daniel's in his hand.

Nick: Let me guess. Someone threw Harry into the deep-fryer again?

Lizzy: Ellis is dead.

Nick: What do you mean he's dead? Did he fall down and crack his head open or what? 

Lizzy: I MEAN Thad found a fresh pile of mincemeat with Ellis's name tag on it. 

She proceeds to pull out said nametag, freshly caked in blood, and tosses it onto the desk. That's when Nick starts taking this seriously.

Nick: S***........ did you clear out the dining hall?

Lizzy: Yep. And I have Thad covering for us on drive thru duty. 

Nick: *sigh*

He opens a drawer and pulls out a gold plated Desert Eagle, along with a fresh magazine.

Nick: Alright, let's have a look.

I did notice though that when he would message me he’d talk like 98% about him and would pop in a “how was your day?” Once in awhile but it was majority just him talking to talk. He didn’t really try very hard to get to know me I felt.

I’m worried this is what it’ll be like tomorrow when I’m supposed to meet him, I also just kinda wanna be home since I’ve been working a lot and wanna enjoy a free day, and would like to not be talked at in a cafe for a few hours.

I'm currently trying to make an ELO system for a marble racing tournament project, and my next goal is to have the group of each marble automatically show up in the B column whenever you type their name in any of the 4 groups (column F, H, J, or L).

For example, when I put Apocalypse in Group C (column J), I want it to automatically show that in cell B2, right next to their name.

However, when I try to do that by using this function:

    =ARRAYFORMULA(
      IF(
        ISNUMBER(MATCH(F2:F13,""Apocalypse"",0)),
        ""A"",
        IF(

It leaves a bunch of blank cells and throws the ""C"" all the way down to B5.

It's like it's copy-pasting all of Group C, shifted it to the left, and deleted all of the names except for the one name I asked it to find.

Is there a way that I can have the ArrayFunction result stay in just one singular cell (B2), rather than covering all of (B2:B13)?

1hrgowh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1hrgowh/honua_kai_review/,Honua Kai Review,"Just coming off a stay at Honua Kai and wanted to give a thorough review for anyone considering as a location. 

The good:
- The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The pool area is quite large with a lazy river sort of situation on one side, a water slide and kids pool in the middle, another large pool on the other side with an adult pool up top. 
- The beach is quite lovely and each unit is equipped with chairs to take out and sit on. I don't believe Maui allows anyone placements of lounge chairs from resorts on public beaches, hence the chairs. 
- The location is next to any food truck lot with lots of options, a 5 min drive to Whalers Village and about 10 mins to Lahaina and Napili areas. 
- Each unit has a full kitchen, washer / dryer and bathtub which is brilliant if traveling with kids.
- There's a cute little store in the lobby of one building that offers gifts, a small selection of groceries and coffee. 

The not so great: 
- The pool chair situation is absurd. Each day it got worse and worse, with people coming down to claim chairs before 6am. These chairs sat empty for hours, as late as 10am. Given we have small children, we were actually up early and ready to use the pool by 7:30/8am with not a single chair available. The resort does nothing to stop this besides put up some signs as empty threats. I was told by another guest they stayed at the Westin condos next door last year and didn't have this issue. 
- There is a sewage treatment plant across the street that stinks at night.  
- There is a garage under the building for parking, but generally fills up by 7pm. There are also no shuttles that service this property. 
- We had to pay $100 for each use of housekeeping which we learned after arriving. It was not included, even for long stays. Check your listing to confirm what's offered for your stay. 
- We had several issues with our unit during our stay from clogged sinks to a water heater that had been leaking and was in fact replaced while we were there. We were without water for several hours. Our unit owner was nice about making some concessions, but what's unclear to us is of this is deferred maintenance by the owners or the Maui Rentals is not keeping the units up to standards. The oven un our unit also needs replacing as evidenced by the fact it took 25 mins to preheat. 
- Our unit shared a wall with a service elevator. It rumbled from 7am to 10pm each day. If we could have moved units, we would have. No listing I saw mentions this, so unless you are partially deaf or never plan on being in your room, recommend avoiding rooms that end in 30 and specifically asking your host if there is an elevator adjacent to your unit. Same goes for the trash room (also loud and smells terrible). ",2,1735777005.0,MauiVisitors,0,1.0,False

I said I'd make a post asking for some advice because I'm trying to improve my life and its a bit rough to do! I'm sure there's a lot of people who feel the same so if this post doesn't fall into a pit hopefully you all gather something from it! And if this is a bit long winded I apologise, I'm not sure how much to write but questions are at the end :)

I'm 24M, soon to be 25 in a couple weeks and I've had mabye not a great time of it. I was kid of a quiet kid in school but had a decent size friend group. I taktd to and kissed my first girl at 17 and soon after that I became enfatuated with her, she rejected me then kissed one of my best friends which was pretty heartbreaking.

I spiralled, left my last year of school before college, had to repeat it then got into my college! (Electronic Engineering) But along the way picked up a nasty drug habit which spiralled into 3 years of drug induced psychosis from my first year of college all the way through to 2021 when I went to rehab and got sober for a couple months. This was an unbelievably bad experience and broke me to the suicide attempts, I would hear people degrading me everywhere I went, made it impossible to socialise and missed out on the whole college experience. After rehab, I went on a couple dates, lost my virginity then soon relapsed after again.

A couple weeks after relapsing I then met a mutual friend who I think is without question the most beautiful and sweetest woman I've ever met. She was interested in me and i told her friends i wanted to ask her on a date but I was slipping back into psychosis and couldn't make it yo work on time let alone start dating, so I held my tongue, but kept thinking about her.

I quit my psychosis causer (Weed) on Jan 1st 2022, and all other drugs on Jan 1st 2023, graduated college, got a job, everything going amazing! I was still thinking about the girl who  I kept in sporadic on/off contact with since we met, even said I'd like to take her for coffee while she was living abroad for a year! She came back, we decided to go for coffee and just before hand  asked to make sure it was as friends, I crumbled told her what I though and she said she wanted to stay friends (did not go for coffee). This upset me a lot and I'm not quite over it over a year down the line.

I have also come to the stage this Christmas where I need to move out and distance myself from my best friends because of their drug addictions and behaviour

The TLDR and my questions (apologies for the length).

I've gone through some pretty bad shit, drug addiction, unhealthy enfstuation with women  and lived like a degenerate for years. I have now gotten to the stage where I am sober for 2 years today, exercise every day, read / play music in my spare time and have a couple good, trustworthy friends. 

But because of everything I've gone through I'm still left with very few friends, underdeveloped social skills and still have an unhealthy relationship with my romantic feelings, and am not very happy. 

But I do have a desire and proven drive to live the best life I can, which is what I am asking advice on.

How have you guys pulled yourselves up to be the people you want to be?
What habits did you develop? What did you do to surround yourselves with the right people? And what helped when the effort of improvement felt like too much?

I hope all of you find the courage to make the changes you want this year! Merry Christmas  and remember, someone loves you!

* Halved the recipe and did these as slice and bake. So easy!
* I added the full amount (not half) of lemon extract AND lemon zest - I guess this means I quadrupled the lemon flavouring? I think they could have been more lemony still. 🙈 Maybe the folks at King Arthur just have really sensitive taste buds?
* Tried pricking a couple but decided I didn't like it so only a couple cookies got fork pricks.
* This was my first time making shortbread and I thought they turned out well with a nice short texture! I appreciated that they weren't too sweet. If I made them again I'd gussy them up with some white chocolate drizzle since they're a little plain as-is.

Basic bread:

* I 1.322'd the recipe after adding my ingredients to the flour measurement of water. 🙄 This is what I get for baking before coffee lol. I added more of everything to fix my proportions and carried on....
* I added softened butter in small pieces to my shaggy dough instead of adding it to my flour, which just felt wrong to do.
* Water temp \~105F, which is warmer than was recommended but more in line with what I would typically use for an enriched dough. HOWEVER I think it caused problems in the final loaf, see note below about wrinkling.
* Used \~50% bread flour instead of just all-purpose, and ended up having to add even more all-purpose than the top end of the flour measurement in the book. Since bread flour absorbs more water this surprised me! I've seen others mention how sticky the dough seemed so I think maybe the flour measurement is a bit light.
* Kneaded with my stand mixer to the windowpane test - with the extra flour the dough turned out lovely, very soft and smooth. I thought the proofing guidelines were accurate. Added an egg wash for shine and baked my (slightly larger) loaves for 35 minutes.
* They wrinkled significantly as they cooled - my oven spring was great so I don't think they were overproofed, and I think they seem well baked, not underbaked. When I was googling for more information about water/dough temperatures I found[ this article by King Arthur ](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/05/29/desired-dough-temperature)where they mention that too-warm water can cause loaves to wrinkle! [News to me](https://media.tenor.com/ZiLugTiVQNgAAAAM/the-more-you-know.gif), so definitely something I can apply to future bakes.
* I bake a lot of bread but haven't really made white bread loaves, so this was fun to do! My shaping technique needs finesse but the texture was great. [Fresh out of the oven and paired with some browned sage butter it was hard to stop eating!](https://imgur.com/O20aKN0) Would definitely make again. :)",13,1735776550.0,BakingSchoolBakeAlong,1,1.0,False

I'm trying to decide whether I should try it with either of my two grinders or if there was a good inexpensive manual grinder that this community might recommend.

Hello there,

I’m a 40-year-old guy living in Bellevue, Washington, and I’m ready to meet someone who’s as driven, curious, and open-hearted as I am. By day, I’ve built a stable career in tech, created a warm and welcoming home, and carved out a life filled with purpose and little joys. But what I truly crave now is to share that life with a partner who not only matches my ambition but also dreams of building something meaningful together—love, trust, and a life full of moments both grand and quietly beautiful.

In a world that constantly pulls us in every direction, I want us to have a space where we can truly *exhale*—where you don’t have to wear your professional mask, where you can lean into trust and feel cherished. To me, love is about creating that sanctuary together, a place where our connection grows deeper with every conversation, every quiet glance, and every small, thoughtful gesture.

I’m especially drawn to those with a slender or petite figure who prioritize fitness and a balanced lifestyle, as health and well-being are values I deeply respect. But more than anything, I’m looking for someone who shares my passion for growth—whether it’s exploring a new hiking trail, laughing over an impromptu kitchen experiment, or savoring a cozy morning with fresh coffee and a warm breeze drifting in from the garden.

Speaking of home, mine is a reflection of my heart: clean lines, quirky art, and a little backyard garden where herbs and flowers thrive under the sun. There’s a guitar leaning in the corner, waiting to strum out a tune, and a fluffy cat who’s mastered the art of napping in sunbeams. Home, to me, is a space we can share—where conversations flow easily, where laughter feels effortless, and where we create daily rituals that turn the ordinary into something special.

Looking to the future, I see love as the foundation for building a life filled with purpose and connection. Whether it’s raising a family someday, celebrating each other’s career milestones, or simply growing old side by side, I’m here for the big dreams and the quiet moments in between. I want us to be a team—lifting each other up, encouraging growth, and always remembering to pause and appreciate the love we’ve built.

In private moments, I’d love for us to create a rhythm of connection and trust—a quiet understanding where you feel safe to let your guard down and truly be yourself. Love, to me, is both a gentle power exchange and a deep partnership—one where vulnerability is celebrated, communication is open, and intimacy feels natural and fulfilling.

If you’re someone who dreams of a relationship that’s equal parts love story and power partnership, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me about your passions, your hopes, and what kind of love story you’d like to create.

Let’s write our next chapter together.

          I went out for donuts + coffee this morning. Hung out by the car for a while soaked up the sun n thought of many things, what went wrong between us being 1, more so whats wrong with me the greater picture… if we will ever meet again if its possible for us. I know u hurt me, but u just beat me to the punch. I wouldve hurt u too, I wasnt ready… Thats why i dont hate u n i wish u the best. Im sorry if u were always waiting for me to let my walls down too. I wish i couldve been more brave the last time i was there, just asked + confessed my feelings, told u how badly i burned inside for u. Its just so complicated for us… always waiting for the other to cave. You were pushing me away so cold, so i did what I always do I played with ur emotions further drove the knife deeper n left. I see my effect on u. I know i make u lose yourself n thats why u act out especially when u dont know whats going on in my head. You think im plotting against u, n when i start to see this I take advantage n act like a brat. Im sorry my love. We’re so alike. So pure at heart we just dont know it, we dont trust each other so we test our love + drive our selves apart. So moody the both of us. 

         Im starting to take all the signs I see now as signs from my angels that I did the right thing in saying goodbye to u. Although some are a downright struggle to deny they are u + ur pure heart reaching for me. Im sorry i treated u so unfairly n thought u were like the rest of the men iv met with ill intentions. The men that just use me n toss me out like a piece of trash, u wanted my whole heart but i just didnt know. I knew deep down ur heart was pure that u were a soulmate n i still chose to come at u with such hesitation. For now I will work on myself n fight these haunting thoughts of my past in hopes i can open my heart more to a future with you. If our story ends here with ur silence n me having unplugged the phone… im thankful u opened my eyes to the idea that i can be softer + softer + softer hehe the way you loved my legs.

1hrg5mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1hrg5mn/migraines_almost_guaranteed_on_flights/,Migraines Almost Guaranteed on Flights,"Whenever I take a long-haul flight (for me it’s anywhere between 5 to 14 hours), with few exceptions, I’ll get a migraine. I’d like to list the potential triggers and get your suggestions on what to do:

Dehydration: sometimes I tried to hydrate more than usual, but it didn’t help much; I tried drinks with electrolytes once, they seemed to be fairly effective, but such drinks are not easily available at an airport outside of North America.

Dryness: this could be a trigger for me. Anyone tried Humidiflyer? Was it helpful?

Air pressure: a potentially big trigger for me. I read that taking off and landing lead to a great change in pressure, but my migraine usually starts about halfway through; on my last trip, I put on a good pair of earplugs, it went well but it could just be the triptan I took many hours before (for a migraine induced from a previous flight)

Sleep/tiredness: alas, don’t always have the fortune to choose the perfect time to fly for sleep syncing. And I think the airlines kind of dictates our rhythm here - when to serve meals, dim/brighten up the lighting etc. Even if you decide to skip meals, the smell, oh that food-in-plane smell will wake you up/be triggering. What do we do here?

Food: I fly economy and the food… at the risk of sounding privileged… is just horrible. Cold items usually go down easier, probably because it smells a lot less. Caffeine is neither beneficial/triggering for me, methinks, but I’m a coffee snob, their coffee is undrinkable imo, again what do we do? I can’t possibly be bringing my aeropress/v60 and ask for boiling water? Their tea is slightly better, but it’s not the same…

Stress: frankly, this isn’t always easy to control; I usually make extensive preparations before a flight so that the process is as smooth as possible and, fortunately, I often fly solo and so don’t have to worry about others; I don’t usually feel stressed, at least outwardly, but who knows? What else can we do to reduce stress? Essential oil sometimes makes me feel slightly better, but only for a short while. I’m a backpack kind of guy (as opposed to using a carry-on luggage, I just find it easier), and I’m beginning to suspect that the heaviness of it might tire/trigger me, anyone had a similar experience?

Noise and lighting: these are out of my control, but they alone are rarely a trigger for me.

1hrg0lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hrg0lr/a_goodbye_note/,A Goodbye Note,"I miss you right now. 

I miss you through the pictures I go through. The synapsis from the hippocampus to my amygdala ache working overtime on memories of you.

Like how long it took you to inch your hand into mine while watching a movie I could no longer focus on. 

Or when you forced my long term foot insecurity out of me when we intertwined our feet those few times. Albeit, that will never not be a bit odd to me, but I was at peace with you, and if I only hold toes with one person in my lifetime I’m glad it was you. 

“A new core memory…” 
I was working. My face resting in a pinched manner, and I remember feeling the tension of work settle in my shoulders and my forehead. 
I had been working in this coffee shop for hours at this point, and decided to post an instagram story telling people to “Pull up if you’re cool.” 
The irony of it all kills me. I had never done something like this before, and you didn’t have Instagram, but by pure coincidence you were indeed cool enough to “pull up.”

I do not believe in coincidences.

I don’t have the proper words to describe the way your hands both shocked me, and soothed my nervous system. Initially I had jumped, and then without needing to turn around, I knew it was you. For how little time we had dated each other, I’m still stunned on the other end of our relationship at how familiar you were. I’ll miss sinking into you.
I swear the adoration I felt was steeping into you through my eyes. Like a tea bag, and I promise I'll never stare at you so lovingly again. I know it would make things weird between us if I let that continue, but your touch was perfect.

When you gently tapped me, three times in a row.
Tap.
I.
Tap.
Love.
Tap. 
You.

You could never say it out loud, but it showed in all you do. Those three little taps.
The special attention you’d give me that I lack now. Your eyes barely meet my own.
You were so intentional and attentive. 

Like when I tried to speak. 


I’ve never been good at talking. It feels like words get locked in my throat, especially when it’s something important I have to say, but you knew somehow!
I would just be living and you could tell what I was saying through lips tied shut by an unseen force. The empathy and understanding you had for me was powerful. Powerful enough to make me realise I’ve never had someone hear me and not just nod their head carelessly while saying “Hmm. That’s hard.” You resonated.
This thought alone is enough to make me nauseous.

And how is it that the worst first date I will ever have had turned into my favorite??
I would have run through the rain with you any day. 

I envy the future we never got to have. I never knew you fully unreserved. Something had always been held away from my reach, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to earn it with time. 
Your love. Your trust. 

In truth I could never withhold love from you. It’s so easy to do. 
My trust was a different story though, and I know you felt it when I was anxious. One bad relationship turned the way I think into a ball of bent sparking wires asking questions about you that couldn’t have been evoked by your actions.
I had prepared myself for you to leave me, and I was proven right in the outcome, but completely wrong in my reasoning. 
But, thank you for working through that with me. My trauma and trials, even if you did so without a cognitive recognition of what you had been doing. Now I know what I’m up against for the next one.

The next one I’m not sure I want yet. 

Who knows. Maybe God is calling me to life-long celibacy and I just haven’t been listening hard enough. 
This is the second time someone has told me that “God told me to break up with you,” and at first this wasn’t a plausible option. God hadn’t told me anything about this, all He said was that I “can make my own decisions.”
And the way this person, my fiance, decided to convey that our break-up was an order from God only after he listed the reasons he had decided we weren’t working out wasn’t lining up with my perception of God. 

Now, I know you. 
I know the way you act and think and process. I’ve observed you long enough to read you like a book, and what I was reading was immediate obedience. 
Your lines were full of respect and assurance that only God could have made certain in your heart. The days after, I saw your sulken grey face, and knew this decision was just as hard for you as it was for me; the victim of your maturity.

This is the second time, and God I’m listening now, I get it.
“Some decisions aren’t for you to make.” I hear you loud and clear…

God is with me, and teaching me, and growing me in a billion little ways through this. I have praised him through all of it and He never left my side, but that didn’t stop me from crying out;

“God it hurts!!” 
“But God, I’m going to miss this one, please!”

The damage is done, so instead I will thank you 1,000 times for breaking up with me. I really appreciate you being obedient to God, even if I no longer know what his plans are for me. I admire your maturity, among many other things about you, and if I kept going I could write a novel about it.

You’re truly beautiful inside and out, and I pray your wife will see you like I do, tenfold.


And just know that while my heart is bruised, I could never take you back when God is the decider of us. Don’t doubt his command. He spoke, and you acted in obedience. This is the truth, but if you ever need a friend I’ll be around.

Signed sincerely,
{the little nickname you gave me.}

I opted for Moka Pot simply because it's the best in terms of cost:benefit for espresso drinks and is close enough. I've watched videos and recipes and made my own thinking to make Moka Pot produce coffee closer to espresso, and I've made a conclusion very close to the Voodoo method.

It's still not espresso and is not your conventional beverage from a Moka Pot, but the Voodoo method allowed me to make espresso drinks just as good as the drinks I make using my espresso machine. I'm not exaggerating, not even in the slightest. The brews I make with this method is consistently amazing (sparing the first couple of tries).

Why Voodoo method and not the normal way? Personally, I like espresso drinks, but not espresso itself on its own. I end up having the drinks like it's been diluted with some water with the normal way, so I use Voodoo method to reduce that. Besides, the preparation is the same anyways, the only difference being the way it's brewed.

Analysis:

Moka Pot coffee has the concentration between espresso and drip coffee. This is because the coffee gets more watery the more it brews in the Moka Pot, so the first parts are the strongest. The problem is, the stronger parts also happen to less extracted and more acidic. How can have coffee that's more concentrated, closer to espresso, yet still balanced? By making adjustments to increase extraction early and not use the water completely.

The Voodoo method's creator begins by boiling water before brewing, making water hotter from the get go and extract quicker. Once the first few acidic drops come out, he turns off the heat source (or add little heat for some pressure if it's too slow). This allows him to continue extracting but slowly just to have less of that acidic part.

After this stage (which he calls pre-infusion, lasting 30-60 seconds), he brews it with a controlled pressure until a certain amount (he suggest 3x weight of the ground coffee, but I personally stick to 120ml with my 6 cup regardless regardless of the weight). Just eyeball it. Rinse the bottom of the Moka Pot with cold tap water to stop brewing. Because he doesn't use all of the water, the beverage is more concentrated but still balanced.",1,1735773987.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

We would still talk a lot at work, and we would get to know each other more and more, she would flirt with me here and there and even got me a little treat with a note saying ""I looked very handsome"". But every time I proceeded to ask her to hang out, she would never give me a yes, told me she wasn't ready, didn't want to hurt me, etc. I really like this girl and really wanted to spend time with her outside of work, but her situation makes a lot of sense and probably wouldn't wanna date anybody myself right after a 5-year relationship, but I was hoping she was interested in me enough for at least coffee. She doesn't initiate contact over text and could go an entire weekend without talking to me (If she wanted to see me, she would not hesitate to reach out and I would set a date) 

I just quit my job, and we said goodbye to each other yesterday and we just gave each a nice hug and I was seriously bummed out because I liked this girl and her sweet personality and knowing more and more about her each day, and I will probably never see her again ... I promised myself never to reach out to her again and if there were any interests on her end or she misses me, she could reach to me right? 

Would appreciate advice and thoughts on this situation, and lmk if you have any further questions !",1,1735773947.0,CoreyWayne,0,0.99,False

Hope the NYE celebrations went well. I decided to make this post as I'm looking to expand my social circle in 2025. I've been too busy with work in 2024 so looking forward to meeting new people.

I'm an avid coffee drinker and big into snuggles and cuddles. Hoping to find somebody on here that would love to grab a coffee (on me), walk around downtown a bit and then snuggle up under the sheets while watching a tv show and keeping each other warm in this weather. I love being the big spoon but would also be open to trying out other positions. Bonus points if you enjoy head pats and scratches.

About Me: 27M, working professional with a few side hustles, average build, and hygienic. In my free-time, I enjoy trying out new restaurants, cafes and also going on walks around DT Toronto. I am also big into movies and tv shows whenever I have down time.

About You: I'm not picky at all. Just looking forward to meeting somebody who is chilled out.

Interested? Message me via chat and I would be happy to answer any questions and share SFW pics.",0,1735773862.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

For most of my life, I was trapped in the grip of addiction. I started drinking when I was 15, and by my late teens, hard drugs became part of my identity. The substances helped me escape, but they also took everything that mattered—my time, my relationships, my dreams, and my self-worth.

On December 31, 2022, I hit rock bottom. It was the worst blackout I’d ever had. That night, I became someone unrecognizable—violent, destructive, and out of control. I had seizures as my body rebelled against me. I woke up the next day overwhelmed by shame, guilt, and condemnation. I knew I couldn’t continue down this path. I was at a crossroads: end my life or leave the liquor behind and never look back.

In the second half of 2022, I had already been trying to quit drinking. I’d confessed to my doctor that I might be an alcoholic. I was prescribed naltrexone, attempted to swap alcohol for coffee, and made countless promises to myself that I wouldn’t drink. Every evening, I declared that tomorrow would be different, only to find myself with a drink in hand the next day. But January 1, 2023, was different. I finally had enough, and I was ready to change.

At first, my biggest reason for quitting wasn’t even for me. I wanted to be better for my boyfriend at the time. I thought that if I could fix my issues, I could fix us. But as the time went on, my reasons began to shift. Every time I felt the pull to drink, I would think about the chaos of that New Year’s Eve and other nights I barely remembered. I thought about the years I had wasted, the dreams I had abandoned, and the traumatic moments I endured because of my addiction—like being sexually assaulted while under the influence.

Quitting wasn’t easy. I often found myself sitting outside liquor stores, tempted to walk inside. But I held on.

Spring 2023, I was hospitalized. I don’t even remember the reason. I was given opioids during my stay, and these were my first drug of choice. I struggled to control myself and began abusing the pills. One night, alone at home, I overdosed. I knew better than to take a hot shower after using, but when you’re chasing that high, all you want is to relax deeper into it. That night was terrifying and became the last time I ever touched drugs.

In May 2023, I lost my job. Everything felt like it was falling apart, but I stayed sober.

In September 2023, I took full custody of my 9-month-old niece. Her parents, both struggling with alcoholism, weren’t able to care for her. Taking her in gave me a sense of purpose and a reason to keep going.

January 2024, I celebrated one year of sobriety. It was a monumental milestone, but life still wasn’t easy.

A few days before my birthday in February 2024, my relationship with my boyfriend came to a devastating end. He disappeared—physically, emotionally, and financially. I was left broker than ever, heartbroken, and raising my niece alone. Her parents were still battling their own demons, and I was determined not to let her fall into the same cycle.

By March 2024, my boyfriend told me he was moving out and I had seemed to hit a wall in my job search. The job market was brutal. The day he left, I received a call offering me a position I had interviewed for. I wouldn’t start for about 4 weeks, but it was a lifeline.

My ex paid the rent through April, when our lease ended. Due to our past disturbances, they refused to renew my lease. But understanding my situation, they allowed me to extend it by 30 days, giving me until mid-May to leave. By the grace of God, my first paycheck came just in time.

In May 2024, I was living in the apartment alone and working at my new job. I began paying off debt and saving, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to secure a new place by the time my lease ended. Right before I had to move out, my ex reached out and, despite everything, offered to let me stay at his new place temporarily. I accepted, though it still makes my head spin when I think about it.

From May to August 2024, I lived with him. It was a hard time, and one day, Spirit told me to leave. I had no home or plan, but I packed up and walked away. I lived in my car, then stayed with a friend who opened her home to me. I am so grateful to her, though it was still a trying time.

During this period, I managed to keep my work-from-home job, but my bond with my niece began to fade since I no longer had a home. Her father had started getting his life together and was able to take her back. I visited her as often as I could, but it broke my heart. She was my reason to push forward, and I wanted to build a home where we could start fresh. It took a while for me to get out of debt, save some extra money and raise my credit score again, in order to get a nice place. 

I was approved for my apartment in September but it wouldn’t be ready for a month. 
In October 2024, I moved into a beautiful new apartment in a new city. It was a fresh start—a chance to rebuild. But my brother and I had a falling out, and as punishment, he said I couldn’t see my niece anymore. That loss still aches, but I’ve spent the last three months grieving, processing, and healing.

I’m learning to love myself as a single woman, rediscovering who I am without the weight of addiction or unhealthy relationships. I am reigniting my passions and embracing new dreams.

Now, on January 1, 2025, I celebrate two years of sobriety. I am sober, grounded, and living in my body for the first time in my life. This is a new world for me—a world of purpose, healing, and boundless possibilities.

Cheers to the journey. Cheers to growth. Cheers to life.

Happy New Year!

I totally understand not wanting to chance a bad experience again. However, just wanted to post this as a reminder that every pregnancy can be very different. 

Example—my first was filled with lots of anxiety (which I do tend to feel physically with tachycardia, nausea, frequent and loose stools, etc) but when I wasn’t anxious I felt great. No to minimal fatigue, minimal morning sickness. It was great. I had no concerns about the physical issues many complain of with pregnancy. For reference, I was 30. 

I’m now in my late 30s, and this pregnancy is so far doable but harder physically. I almost considered not doing another pregnancy because of my anxiety around the prior pregnancy and newborn period, though. 
Physically, I’m still having daily nausea in the second trimester. Still fatigued every day. Can’t enjoy coffee like I used to. It could be age, but I’m pretty healthy and fit otherwise. I have a supportive family who are helpful, and my one kid has been very understanding and doing things on her own when I’m too tired. 
On the flip side, with motherhood no longer being new to me, my anxiety has been minimal thus far, which is really nice.

I just wanted to post this as a reminder that prior pregnancy experience doesn’t guarantee the same next time. 

Might be helpful for others to share their experiences too—maybe it would help those on the fence about going through the crazy body changes of pregnancy again.

1hrffvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/1hrffvg/i_tried_68_different_chocolate_chip_cookies_from/,I tried 68 different chocolate chip cookies from around the Twin Cities over the past two years.  Here are my rankings.  What are your favorites?,"I tried 68 different chocolate chip cookies from restaurants, stores and bakeries over the past two years.  I initially started with just cookies you could find at a restaurant, and then I expanded it to grocery stores, gas stations, bakeries, and places that are known for their cookies.

Here are my favorites for each category:

* Best overall cookie:  Insomnia Cookies oatmeal walnut
* Best buy-in-bulk cookie:  Costco
* Best fast food cookie:  Chick-fil-A
* Best sandwich chain cookie:  Potbelly
* Best coffee chain cookie:  Scooter's
* Best gas station cookie:  Casey's
* Best MN-only cookie:  Lund's and Byerly's Warm Ooey-Gooey
* Best room-temp (non-warm) cookie:  Mississippi Market
* Most controversial (I'm guessing?):  Jimmy John's

Criteria:

1. The cookie was sampled as-served (i.e., eaten warm if served warm).  Many cookies were requested to be served warm, if possible.  Many of the warm cookies would be ranked significantly lower if they were allowed to cool down (they usually become quite hard).
2. The cookie needed to be from a place with multiple locations in the Twin Cities.  This just made it easier for me to limit my locations.
3. The cookie needed to have a traditional chocolate chip base - no double chocolate cookies, gluten free or vegan cookies.  This was also to limit my locations.
4. No limited time flavors.  My original intent was to find a cookie that I could get at any time I wanted a cookie.
5. No pre-packaged ""cookie aisle"" or frozen cookies - only cookies from over-the-counter or bakeries.

My personal flavor preferences:  a thick, warm cookie with semisweet or dark chocolate with a hint of crispiness and a non-bitter aftertaste.  Oatmeal and walnuts are a bonus.  Cookies that have a unique flavor profile, or ones that stand out from the others (e.g., Jimmy John's) are ranked a little higher.

Cookies in higher tiers are ranked higher, though personal preference may depend on the day.  I tend to think of the tiers in this way:

* S:  special occasion cookies
* A:  dessert cookies or for splitting with several people
* B:  a cookie that you might bring in bulk to a party
* C:  if you need a cookie in a pinch, these will work
* F:  don't bother

Notes:

*Sweet Martha's, Doubletree, and HOM Furniture are included mainly for refence.*

*Festival Foods and Knowlan's are owned by the same company and serve the same cookies.*

*Wuollet Bakery and A Baker's Wife serve the same cookie (confirmed by the worked at A Baker's Wife).*

1hrfev6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Effexor/comments/1hrfev6/the_mistake_of_cold_turkey/,The mistake of cold turkey,"Throwaway account for privacy. 

First some basic background. Started Effexor 2-3 years ago for basic anxiety/depression. Dr quickly moved me to venlafaxine after Prozac, since I said prozac had given me an upset stomach. I wish I stayed on prozac since it seemed to work better.

Effexor/Venlafaxine also gave me upset stomach, and also eventually excessive sweating (drenching my clothes, and if at night, sheets as well). I also slowly lost all motivation. I wasn't necessarily depressed, but I just didn't care to do anything. Perfectly content to sit on the couch and be a vegetable watching bad tv or youtube, or simply sleep. I could get a solid 10 hours of sleep at night, and still take an hour long nap during the day, even after a few cups of coffee.

My Dr was dismissive of my side effects and had been generally hard to reach. So, when I realized my Rx was about to run out, I called, and said I needed to make an appt and also urgently needed a refill, since I only had a couple days left. So, I left a voicemail, asking to call me back, and just schedule an appointment at any time, other than one specific evening. The Dr called back a week later, leaving me a voicemail, saying she can schedule me at precisely the time I said I wasn't available. 

Frustrated, I never called the Dr back, because I had already resigned to just giving up the meds anyway. I was never warned of the severe side effects of sudden discontinuation. I was on 150mg. I had a few pills of 37.5mg that I used to self-taper over like... 2 days. I only did this because I knew I'd get brainzaps if I missed a dose.

**The cold turkey withdrawal side effects**

Well, over the course of approximately a week, the brain zaps got worse. I was able to generally function normally, even as the zaps got worse, and I started to feel general malaise. It all came to a head after about a week, when I was feeling off all day, and when I finally went to lie down in bed, the brain zaps were nearly constant, and I was feeling dizzy and unsettled. I tried going to sleep anyway, but panic quickly set in. I can only describe it as a panic attack. I was afraid of everything; my dreams, the dark, of losing my grip on reality. I thought I wouldn't be able to tell reality from a hallucination (I didn't hallucinate). I had to turn a light on, then the TV, but I couldn't really watch the TV, because I was afraid I'd get suck in the TV show or movie that was on. But the extra noise and light helped. I was super restless, kept going to the bathroom, and eventually started shaking uncontrollably, and unable to think straight. My hands started tingling, like a kind of numb feeling. Shadows and blinking lights that have always existed in my house were startling me. I ended up texting 988 so I could talk to a human and hopefully get past the panic and regrip on reality. It was literally the worst experience of my life that lasted several hours, and wasn't sure I'd be able to recover from. I was a hairs edge from going to the hospital, of which I was in no position to drive, so it would've had to have been by ambulance.

The chat helped, but I was still anxious and restless but eventually was able to fall asleep at 3-4am. I was so dizzy though, I had a dream I was in a centrifuge. I woke up again at 7am, again feeling anxious and restless, and difficult to concentrate. I was able to call my dr and get a rx in, and then I was able to pick up the rx at about 8:30am, though nearly having an emotional break at the pharmacy counter (fortunately they were very patient and understanding). 

A couple hours after taking the meds, I was feeling a bit better... just completely exhausted in every sense of the word (though not tired), and still had to attend a family function later in the day. I was able to function fine, though had a headache, and little to no appetite. It was nice to have the worst of it behind me.

I held off on tapering for once we were past the holidays, just in case. Though, now, if I'm just LATE with my dose, as I'm going to sleep, it feels like panic might set back in (my whole body starts tingling numb, and my breathing gets heavy, and my mind starts to race). 

I'm on day 2 or 3 of tapering now (from 150 to 112.5), and so far the only side effects are occasional, brief dizzy spells. My upset stomach seems to be getting better (before I was gagging and/or throwing up at least once a day), and today I had a bit more energy and motivation than usual. 

Reading some of the posts here, it seems like the final steps of 37.5 to 0 are the worst. I'll count beads if I have to though. I want off this poison in the worst way, and as I told my dr... no more experiments on my brain. I know these meds help some people, but for me, the risks aren't worth the small benefits they've provided. I just need situational, temporary relief from anxiety, not a lifetime physical dependence on a medication.

Thanks for reading, it felt good to get off my chest.

tl;dr: cold turkey venlafaxine is the worst idea ever, is dangerous, stupid, do not do it, do not run out of your prescription. Do not take venlafaxing without understanding the physical dependency it creates.",1,1735773362.0,Effexor,8,1.0,False

Now I have to use tadalafil to have sex, otherwise it doesnt work.

At the beginning I thought it has due to my testosterone. My T levels were 500, and after a lot of research, I was able to increase my T from 500 to 800+ by eating a lot of butter and eggs, because they have a lot of colesterol, which is used to build our T levels.

My hope was that by increasing the testosterone, I was able to have hard erections, but I'm still relying on tadalafil.

Things that help me a bit are Tyrosine and Vitamin C.

From my tests here, seems that lack of sleep and ingesting coffee are really bad for erections.

I'm also testing here with betaine HCL, because I suspect that my stomach is not producing enough acid to absorb all the vitamins and minerals.",3,1735773068.0,erectiledysfunction,1,1.0,False

This is a really stressful time period for me, and I am a stress eater. Not necessarily a binge eater, I just like to snack on stuff while I'm studying and most importantly, have a drink next to me at all times. Whether that be coffee, matcha, or iced tea. 

I've set my mind to losing weight before, and I actually did it, losing about 11kg (24lbs) and reaching 53kg (116lbs). However over the course of the last 2 years I truly gained the weight back, with me now being at my all time highest weight of 73kg (160lbs). Some of the reasons include the overwhelming amount of studying I now have to do, causing me to be unable of working out (I used to love going on walks/runs and dancing, which helped me to lose the weight). Now I simply do not have the time to workout or even go on walks, and I crave junk food and snacks due to how much stress im under, which makes me spontaneous and not prioritize what type of food im eating. I've gained face fat, and while it isnt as evident in the rest of my body, I feel uncomfortable and bloated most of the time.

I don't know how to fix this issue because frankly, I used to have way more free time and energy that id use to focus on my fitness journey, but now I barely have time to sleep. I want to lose 15kgs (33lbs) or more and I have about 4-6 months to do so.

Where to find it,"A Newport restaurant's cocktail has made Esquire's list of The Best Martinis in America, 2024.

The list features 44 drinks. It was published on Dec. 26 and names Clarke Cooke House's Espresso Martini among the best.

Located in a Colonial-era house on Bannister's Wharf in the heart of Newport's waterfront, the Clarke Cooke House serves food and drink on two floors including their Candy Store and Bistro.

Why a martini list?

Citing ""martini mania,"" Esquire said the trend back to sipping sophisticated martinis began in 2015 or 2016 but it's cresting now.

""The beauty of a martini is rooted in its icy simplicity: traditionally it is a cold, clear thing that goes well with hot, salty things,"" they wrote. But they also noted, ""absurdity and decadence has begun to emerge: a martini that’s actually just a beer, martinis infused with cheese, a martini that you pour on top of ice cream. We love them.""

Newport's best

Esquire writer Madison Vain said ""People have been doing fabulous things in Newport since the Gilded Age, so it’s no surprise to find excellent martinis in this city of mansions.""

She mentions the ingredients for Clarke Cooke House's martini are a familiar blend of Absolut Vanilla, Kahlúa, and espresso. It's in the execution that the cocktail earns accolades, she says.

""Shaken, shaken, and then shaken even a little longer, the thing is served arctic cold and downright fluffy,"" she wrote.

In 1780, Clarke Cooke, a well-to-do Newport merchant, had the house built on Thames Street. Nearly two centuries later, David W. Ray bought the house and had it moved in 1973 to its present wharf location.

He remains the owner of the Clarke Cooke House, one of the city's most popular dining spots with locals and tourists.

Only one other martini in New England made the list and it's also an espresso martini. Find it in Portland, Maine, at Room for Improvement. Their version includes Maine's Allen coffee brandy, Giffard's Banane du Brésil, cold brew, and dark rum.",7,1735772794.0,RhodeIsland,3,0.69,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1hrf4mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1hrf4mm/cutting_ties_with_my_longtime_discord_friend/,Cutting ties with my long-time discord friend. ,"I’ve been thinking about this decision for so long but I think there are really choices that linger in your mind, taking root, yet still feel impossible to act on. 

A little backstory, tambay kasi talaga ako sa discord. I live alone, away from my family and sometimes, it really does feel lonely and Discord was there to save the day. I made a lot of friends until I entered this one voice call where we met each other. 

Back in December 2022, I was 18 and I met this guy on a server on discord who eventually became a part of my everyday life. I shared so many things to him, may mga bagay na siya ang unang nakakaalam kesa sa main circle ko, may mga sikreto din akong siya lang ang may alam and that just shows how comfortable and open I was to him. He wasn’t just a friend; he was a constant. We’d talk every day, call for minutes or hours, and send each other the most mundane photo updates. This became our rhythm everyday.

But here’s the catch: we don’t know each other’s names, I don’t know where he studies (though he knows where I study, since I’ve been open about it), or even what we look like. By all conventional measures, we’re strangers. We never even exchanged socials—no Instagram, no Facebook, no connection outside of Discord. Our bond has existed entirely in that bubble, for two years. Yes, two years. 

Yet, when I think of everything I do know about him, I realize just how much he’s not a stranger. These are just among others but he’s from Cavite, has four siblings, a dog named Dashy, and is taking up radiologic technology. He has trypophobia, doesn’t drink coffee, but has developed a growing love for matcha—something I proudly take full credit for! And similar to me, he’s also drawn to the quiet of late-night walks and finds comfort in the simplicity of strawberry-flavored food. He plays the electric guitar, has a passion for streetwear, ukay, and above all, his personality mirrors mine in ways that are almost uncanny. He has told me several stories of him too!

Ang daming nangyari sa loob ng dalawang taon na yun and even though he was never there physically, he was present. He was there during the quiet moments of my life and the loud ones, too. We saw each other graduate from senior high school, step into college, and grow into the person we are now. Through heartbreaks and rainbows, we had each other’s backs.

We’ve thought about meeting up, of course. But I think that is one thing that excites and terrifies us both. But neither of us has been ready to take that step, and that’s okay. Ang dami lang tanong na naglalaro sa isipan ko. What if magbabago ang lahat if nagkita kami? What if yung connection pala na nabuo namin online ay iba pala sa totoong buhay? Pero paano din if magkita kami? What could be ahead of us? 

So why do I plan to cut ties with him? I don’t have an answer that feels good enough. But maybe because as I grow older, the idea na wala naman sigurong patutunguhan ito hits me hard? Or maybe there doesn’t have to be a reason. What I only know of is that he’ll always hold a special place in my heart, one stitched together with matcha-flavored memories, late-night calls, and all the small, unspoken ways he made life lighter.

If ever mabasa mo man ‘to, I’ll miss you so much, Kazie. And I’ll always be grateful for the two years that felt like a lifetime. I love you to bits ❤️‍🩹

1hrf3r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thyroidhealth/comments/1hrf3r0/question_about_changes/,Question about changes ,"Hi everyone, in 2022, I was diagnosed w hashimotos hypothyroidism.
I have a 35mm goiter on left side and a 9cm goiter of the right. Endo said let's try meds first. No change in the sizes, but now i have an enlarged lumph node on the right side down near my clavicle by my throat about the size of a quarter. Endo said not to worry about it. Yeah ok. 
Was put on levo, got so sick from it and gained so much weight. Endo put me on unithroid and I was feeling a lot better. For awhile.
Was told I'm also insulin resistant and was given metformin.
Ok, that...that was idk...I spent the majority of the day in the bathroom. Endo said stay on it. 
I dropped 30lbs in 4 months. Weight plateaued. 
My thyroid levels (TSH) dropped to 0.01 (when I first got to the endo it was above 7, not exactly a big deal compared to a lot of people). Endo was thrilled. Ok, if you say so. T4 and T3 were where he wanted them too.
Ok now I have other medical problems (hbp, obesity, bipolar 2, anxiety, RLS, insomnia, severe asthma, and now perimenopause (these are the major ones and only ones im on meds for except perimenopause)). And yall...this is just debilitating.
Hot flashes are horrendous. Mood swings. I'm on meds for my bipolar, and they won't change them because they know everything I'm dealing w is physical. Been on bipolar meds for 7 years, it's not mental what I'm going through. I'm beyond exhausted. It's hard to get out of bed because emy body aches. You can only ask so much of advil, Tylenol or aleve (not all taken at the same time). 
And now this:
So idk if its just me but what is up w food?
Certain foods smell gross to me to the point I want to throw up. (Anything chicken, including eggs, no pork products at all (I lived on bacon and ham), dairy is definitely out, anything processed is out). You'd think I would have lost weight w being so restrictive. I portion my food, plenty of protein and veggies, barely any carbs (please do notngive me crap about carbs I have to have them, you don't, especially since my body doesn't like processed carbs, so I get them from fresh vegetables and fruit). Calories are at 1500. Protein 90, limited fat, carbs are below 30. I don't do keto or low carb, I'm following more of a Mediterranean thing, but I do eat beef. I don't do fake sugars. I honestly don't care for baked goods, or candy. Used too, but not now. 
I stayed the course during the holidays. 
But none of that matters. Not one bit.
Nope. Gained back 10lbs. It's not water weight either.
So idk what to do. I see the Endo on the 20th of this month. He's gonna think I'm crazy.
Is the food thing thyroid related or is this something else?
It's like I have everything that is fighting me w weight loss.
I'm very active, I drink tons of water, no coffee, no sugar. I'm currently at 250lbs. 
W everything I have going on I just can't function.
Bipolar meds aren't the ones who have weight gain associated w them.
The metformin isn't working anymore.
I feel like crap everyday, I'm so tired, I haven't slept good in over a year. My period is whenever it wants to come and stay for however it wants to stay. Never had that problem before.

It's like idk how many more meds I need to be on without canceling out another  med or making it worse. 
I'm tired of being a guinea pig. I get it, trial and error. But this is just too much.
I'm desperate...any help please...",1,1735772509.0,thyroidhealth,0,1.0,False

1hrf2hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hrf2hi/help_me_choose_the_perfect_lowmaintenance_coffee/,Help Me Choose the Perfect Low-Maintenance Coffee Machine (Budget Flexible),"Hi coffee experts,

I’m looking for advice on upgrading my coffee machine setup to something more low-maintenance. Currently, I own the Calphalon BVCLECMP1 Temp iQ Espresso Machine with Steam Wand (stainless), and while I love the coffee it makes, I absolutely hate the mess and hassle of scooping ground coffee into the machine’s cup area for the espresso. I also find the espresso a bit lighter than what I would normally enjoy. Also, it’s not set up to be able to make coffee and can only really create shots of espresso.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

Low Maintenance: I want a machine that grinds the beans and brews the coffee with just a button press. Minimal cleanup is key.

Durability: I need something reliable because I’m not great at troubleshooting or fixing things if the machine has issues.

Ease of Use for My Husband: My husband is currently using a Keurig, and he won’t use a machine unless it’s truly as simple as pressing a button. I want him to enjoy good-quality coffee with minimal effort.

Espresso and Coffee Options: I want fresh espresso shots or coffee brewed with freshly ground beans.

Optional Features: The ability to make cappuccinos or lattes is a nice bonus, but I’m worried about the extra cleaning involved, so it’s not a dealbreaker if it doesn’t have a milk frothing feature.

Budget: While I’d like to stay under $1,000, budget isn’t a dealbreaker if there’s a perfect machine slightly above that range.

I’ve bbeen doing some research, but don’t feel confident as I’ve found some reviews admit the grounds get clogged in some machines or nightmare stories with machines breaking within 1 year or less. This is something I would like to avoid. 

I’d love your recommendations for a machine that checks these boxes. Bonus points for any insight into the cleaning and maintenance process of your suggestions.

What’s worked for you? What machines should I steer clear of? Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance!

i’m so grateful that this time me quitting was a lot more easier than the other time when i tried to quit in the summer time. 

i think it’s a lot easier because i went into this whole journey positive, and excited. excited for the good health, the saved money, and simply just not being controlled by smoking. (also can flex and tell people i quit one of the hardest addictions and im going strong🤣)

obviously i had cravings, and sometimes kinda get this “empty” feeling without it, but i’ve replaced it with a TONNN of iced coffee, and sweet treats, so at least now i have something to look forward too throughout my day. 

i’m really glad i decided to get a little head start on quitting before the new year, im also on winter break still so im looking forward to being able to come back to school nicotine free, and im glad i quit now, & got the worst of it out of the way in the comfort in my own home. 

but yea, this has been so great so far i can already feel my body feeling so much better. idk if it’s just placebo affect or what, but ive been feeling so much more energy, and motivation. less mood swings, and  i’ve just been really proud of myself!!!

I had posted this a few days ago but deleted it after an hour because it was making me more anxious and I realized I wasn't ready for advice, but now I am. Also, sorry in advance for the incredibly long post. (And thank you to the few who managed to comment before I deleted the previous one)

TLDR: Multiple instances of boundaries that were crossed between boyfriend and best friend. Ultimately, my boyfriend made a move on my bestfriend when we were all in bed together.

Also I very much understand that I played a very big role in enabling this, but I have very poor confrontation skills especially when it comes to this specific friend.

Hello, this happened months ago and I decided to stay with my boyfriend but now I've become with obsessed with ruminating over the situation and having daily panic attacks over it. I just need support and advice on how to handle these emotions. I've already made plans to speak to a therapist but my appointment isn't for another two weeks and I just need to get this off my chest.

This past summer, my (23 F) and (24 M) bf moved to another city temporarily for an internship that I had. My best friend (22F) also lives in that city, so throughout my time there we spent a lot of time together.

My boyfriend and best friend are very similar and are from the same country, so they had a lot to connect on. This didn't bother me that much at first, but towards the last few weeks I honestly felt like a third wheel to them on more than once instance.

There were also some physical boundaries that were crossed. One time, after I had thrown a house party for some new friends I had made, my bf was really drunk and needed help getting into bed. My bff and I helped him get on the bed and he immediately dozed off. I was about to turn to my bff and tell her that I got it from here and she could head to bed, but she began trying to unbutton his pants. I moved her hand and told her to stop and she did. I tried telling myself that she was just trying to help (which I do think that was her genuine intention) but it still felt very inappropriate.

She also got into bed with us that night. My boyfriend had woken up and got up to go to the bathroom and change his own clothes and she got in next to me, which so happened to be the middle of the bed. When my boyfriend came back, he got in on the other side so she was essentially sandwiched between us. We layed like that until I finally got so uncomfortable I got up and put myself between them.

We also all went on a road trip together to a nearby national park. When we got to our motel (one room but there were two beds) my boyfriend mentioned how he was thinking about getting his hair braided. She asked him if he'd want her to do it and he said yes. She gets on our bed and leans over him while on her knees with her whole body pressed against his back. I was sitting on the other corner of the bed watching this all happen and feeling my stomach dropped. But again, I kept telling myself that these are two of the closest people to me in my life, they wouldn't do anything to hurt me.

The next day, we went on a hike. Both my bf and bff are a bit more fit than I am and outpaced me quite a bit. It got to a point where I couldn't even see them at some points. To be fair, they would stop once in a while to make sure I was ok but would again keep going.

On the drive back from the park, they would mostly talk between themselves with me again feeling like a third wheel. When we dropped her off at her place, I confronted my boyfriend about it and he apologized and told me that he thought I just needed some alone time while on the hike. He did mention that there was a moment on the trip that did make him a bit uncomfortable.

At the motel, while I was showering, my bff fully changed in the same room as my boyfriend. The motel room had a separate area for the sink and the closet that was outside of the shower/toilet and still separate from the bedroom, so it's not like she didn't have anywhere else to change. My boyfriend had been sitting on our bed on his phone waiting for us to finish getting ready when she walked to her bed and started changing, He mentioned that he didn't realize that's what she was planning on doing when she walked into the bed area and when he looked up and saw her in her underwear, which was just a thong, he was caught extremely off guard. He stated he felt weird after that but didn't want to make her uncomfortable by bringing it up.

Honestly, at this point it was on me because I should have said something to my bff after that, but I didn't. It was near the end of our trip and I was scared that if I brought it up, it would be taken as If I was sl\*t shaming her or trying to say she had to dress more modestly around him. I also (and still sorta am) was under the impression that she wasn't trying to have sex with him or anything, she has always just been super comfortable and flirtatious with everyone she knows including myself.

Then comes the last night of our trip. She's at our place again and decides to sleep in bed with us again but I make sure I'm in the middle this time. The following is a mix of what my friend and bf later confessed to me:

As I was sleeping, my friend reached over me and pulled my bf closer to us. She patted his arm as she did so and he reached over and did the same to her shoulder. She then turns around so that her back is facing away from us. My boyfriend says that after this his hand was brought down to her stomach where she held it and traced patterns on the back and palm of his hand. He misinterprets this as a flirtatious advance and decides to make a move. He slips his fingers into the waistband of her shorts near her hips and leaves it there. After a minute, she turns back onto her back and his hand slips to the space right below her stomach. She then removes his hand and places it back on her stomach. That's it and they both fall asleep.

The next morning, I went out for coffee and during that time my boyfriend sits down with my bff and they talk about what happened. He apologizes for touching her inappropriately but that he got caught up in the confusion and ambiguity of a lot of their interactions recently. He stated that he felt there was a higher-than normal level of intimacy between all three of us and he misinterpreted a lot of that as romantic/sexual intimacy. She agrees with him and let's him know that none of her actions were meant to be sexual. They both decide it would be better to stop having any sort of intimacy with each other, no matter the intention, and that they value each other's friendship and relationship with me.

By the time I get back, they were deep in conversation about their favorite movies so I had no idea anything had happened at all. My bff and I then go out to eat one last time together before I leave for the airport. She tells me she has something important she would like to discuss with me and that if we're not on the same page on this issue, we cannot be friends anymore. She then proposes us entering in a 'Boston Marriage', a platonic marriage between two women where we would have kids together via IVF and insinuating that my bf would be the sperm donor (i.e. one of us would have our egg fertilized and it would be placed in the other person to carry). Essentially, we would all have kids and raise them together, living under the same roof.

This is where I fucked up. At the beginning of the conversation, the boston marriage and IVF wasn't mentioned. It was more of a conversation about how she was hurt that I didn't include her in a lot of the life planning stuff I would talk about with my partner. I told her I had no problem being involved in my future life plans, but I was under the impression it would be more like a full house situation where we would have our individual families but still be very close/live near each other. Once I agreed to that, we went in more detail and these other things got mentioned as we were heading back to my apartment. I knew immediately I didn't want these things but just didn't have the balls to put my foot down and say that's not at all was envisioning at the start of this conversation. The conversation ended with her telling me we'd continue this conversation with my bf when she'd come to visit us in our hometown in about a month to discuss where we'd all live together.

My partner and I are back in our home city in our own apartment. I push the conversation with my friend to the back of my head and just focus on other stuff for awhile. However, one night my boyfriend mentions how he and bff have been texting. He noticed my face drop and offers to show the messages. They've been texting substantially since we've left, even sending each other voice messages. (Side note: this was shocking to me mostly because my bff doesn't even text me with that much substance and much regularity, usually just a phone call every few weeks.) He assures me that it's all friendly conversation and even offers to stop talking to her if it makes me uncomfortable. I tell him it's ok because I never want to be at a point where I dictate who my partner talks to. I do tell him about the conversation about the boston marriage thing and that sometimes it feels like we're crossing into throuple territory. I then press him and ask him if he's attracted to her. I could tell I was making him nervous, so I kept pressing him. He tells me he has something tell me.

My boyfriend says that he's always generally had a fantasy of a threesome, which we've discussed before but that he'd only want it to be with a person that he knew and trusted. He said that although he wasn't attracted to my bff individually he had thought about her as a possibility if we were to ever have a threesome.

I tell him that that's never going to happen and we drop it. I drop it mostly because I thought a fantasy is just a fantasy, I had no idea he had already made a move on her and he didn't admit this during the conversation.

My friend comes to visit and stays with us a week later. I should note that we do not talk about the boston marriage and children stuff at all during this trip. My boyfriend intentionally avoids hanging out with us because he knows I've become uncomfortable with the dynamic.

On the last day of her visit, my bff mentions wanting to wear something more masculine to wear to the beach and I offer for her to look in my bf and I's closet. She picks out one of my bf's shirts and asks me if she can wear it. At the time, since I didn't know about all that went down, agree to it. On our way back to my place, she plans out how when we get back she's gonna surprise my bf by pretending to be him since she's wearing his clothes and does exactly that.

We decide to stay up until it's time to take her to the airport and watch a movie. I finally relent and say I need to take a nap about a hour before we need to head out and bf agreed especially since he was driving. We go to our bed and she comes with us and once again we're all cuddling in bed with me in the middle (mostly they're both cuddling me and I'm laying straight bc im uncomfortable). Once it's time to go, she packs up her stuff and offers the shirt back to my bf. He tells her she can keep it if she'd like and she takes it with her.

Two days later, my bff calls me and says that she needs to tell me something. She then tells me what happened on the last day of our summer trip and that the reason that she's telling me is that before she came to visit us, my bf made a playlist for her and it had some sexual/romantic songs on it. I immediately tell her that it's not her fault and that I'm not upset with her and confront my boyfriend. He doesn't try to defend himself and tells me everything in detail. He apologizes profusely and says he was just so afraid of losing me he took the cowards way out.

My bf makes playlist for all of his close friends, so that act in particularly doesn't necessarily shock me. I made him go through each song on the playlist and tell me why he decided to add each. Most of the songs are traditional songs from their native country that are also present in playlists he's made for other friends. However, there were about 3 or 4 songs that were explicitly sexual/romantic. His explanation is that he likes the beat/melody of those songs and that he has them and other similar songs on playlists he's made for other friends.

I'm obviously more upset about the fact that he explicitly made a move. He tells me he doesn't have a justifiable reason. That he was tired of the ambiguous intimacy and just wanted to see what would happened. He tried telling me about what happened before but chickened out and just told me he only fantasized about a threesome. He felt extremely shameful over what happened and hurting his and bff's friendship so he made the playlist as a 'token of friendship'.

It's been months since this all went down. My bff and boyfriend are no longer are in contact with each other, and I basically have separate relationships with both of them. My bff says she loves me and that she'll never make me choose between them because she knows how much he means to me, but if we were to get married, she wouldn't attend the wedding. This was heartbreaking for me. 

I'm also devastated by the prospect of leaving my boyfriend. I was housing and assisting my mom who had left my abusive dad the year prior. She ended up going back to him and blamed me for it saying that living with me was so unpleasant that I drove her back there (she was secretly going back to see him on the weekends and was upset that I was so upset when I found out). My bf was my rock during this period of my life. He cared for me and helped me through obstacles that would have been insurmountable without him. My dad was sending me violent threats via text every day and this man would stay up with me all night until I felt safe.

The idea of breaking up with him feels so incredibly devastating and I feel like my life would be over. I've never had someone love me so much and make me feel so secure and I don't think I'll ever find someone else like that again.

I just don't know what to do and ultimately feel like I'm a terrible person for that. I feel as if I've picked a boy over my friend and feel a lot of shame and guilt over that. She tells me to not feel guilty, that she is going to be my friend no matter what, but I am so afraid she's going to call me one day and tell me she's changed her mind. 

On the other hand, I feel resentful of her. I know a lot of it may be internalized misogyny, so I try to redirect my thoughts, but I do feel she crossed a boundary with him. None of my other close friends were ever physically affectionate with him like she was, and I don't think I would ever think to be physically affectionate like that with any of my friends' partners.

At the same time, I know that's not an excuse for my boyfriend since he's the one who explicitly made a move. I just feel terrible, guilty, and shameful all the time. I'm having daily panic attacks and feel so much grief over a beautiful thing being stained and ruined forever. It feels so unfair. After a lifetime of abuse, I thought I finally found something good and beautiful in my life and it's been ripped away from me. I feel so out of control of my life. And I have no one to talk to about this and no one to seek comfort from except from the person who hurt me. I feel so alone, and I don't know what to do. It's eating me alive.

Sorry again for the incredibly long post, a lot of it is just stuff I needed to write down to make sense of it. As I'm reading it over I can't help but think what a stupid situation I've gotten into just because I wasn't more assertive.

If you made it through the whole thing I appreciate it. Any advice on how to deal is helpful.",2,1735772136.0,survivinginfidelity,1,1.0,False

[My Father Won't Hear about This by meandminniemcg](https://archiveofourown.org/works/59665306)

[Happy in Hollywick by Truelee_A_Black](https://archiveofourown.org/works/61019488)
> Draco is happy living the little life he has made for himself in the picturesque village of Hollywick, he has his garden. He has his friends, even if there are far too many Gryffindors among them these days. He has his business and most days his body cooperates enough to get him out of bed despite all he has put it through.... Things could certainly have turned out a lot worse.
> 
> Life did not turn out the way Harry expected it to, or maybe how everyone else expected it to turn out for him anyway. After flaming out of Aurordom Harry lost himself in trying to feel anything other than simmering rage. Thankfully those days are now behind him, he just wants to live a happy life, baking delicious treats and selling his wares in the lovely muggle village he has picked as his new home.... surely he can be happy in Hollywick.

[Pieces Of Me by Shewhxmustnxtbenamed](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58465078)
> Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter have never been friends. After finding themselves isolated from others due to their own specific problems, they somehow connect. While Harry ignores his issues with addiction, and Draco disguises just how horrible his relationship is, a friendship blooms between them. Draco must choose between the life he's known for the past five years with Cormac McLaggen, or the life that Harry offers him, and the consequences that follow.

[Swipe Right by MrsRupertGrint1769](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43016124)

[Dreary by raspberrybalm](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58678216)
> A vile of Felix Felicis, a Resurrection Stone, and a blond walk into an Avada... The punchline? Draco's life, it would seem. He can't win for losing. His mother's gone, his girlfriend's in love with his mate, and The Order won't take him no matter how many baddies he slaughters. The solution? A Time Turner. The solution to the consequential havoc of messing with time? Harry Potter, of course. Only, the bloke's been dead for fifteen years.

[Everything is coming up Draco by Liligalaxy](https://archiveofourown.org/works/42355137)
> A chubby street cat, a Potions & Coffee shop and a fashionista best friend who thrives on gossip. This has been Draco's life for the past five years. He's still healing from a guilt that never fades and hiding from a past that always burns, but if there is one things the universe knows, is that Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter can never get too far from each other.
> 
> An empty house, mind-numbing Ministry balls and a passion from traveling. Harry has spent the last two years never settling down in one place, always searching for that something. What he doesn't know was that, in the quietest part of London, he is about to discover what that something is. Again.
> 
> Or, how Draco and Harry meet after years of Never-thinking-about-each-other and suddenly it is all they can think about.

> Harry's life has not turned out the way he envisioned. He hadn't planned to impregnate Draco Malfoy after a careless, drunken hate fuck. Or that, a year and a bit later, Draco would reluctantly invite him to a fancy woodland retreat with their 11-month-old son, Scorpius. Or that there would only be one bed.

[Un, Deux, Trois by megreads99](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58523971)
> Draco had an easy goal for his 8th Year at Hogwarts: keep his head down and under no circumstances, create a stir. Burdened by the trauma of the war, Draco wasn’t interested in making friendships, but the Savior seemed to be annoyingly persistent about ruining that. Git. Potter was everywhere he looked, filled to the brim with surprising wit and unruly hair and fetching smiles that did something alarming to Draco’s chest.
> 
> Unfortunately, Draco knew all too well that it wasn’t a matter of if he broke for Potter, but rather when.

[Our Dream by SquibNation10](https://archiveofourown.org/works/59494024)
> Out of character? Impulsive? Perhaps. But all Draco knew was that he needed to escape his old life, with its suffocating expectations and stifling control. Answering a mail-order bride ad—an absurd and unlikely choice—seemed like the most logical way for him to break free and start over.
> 
> So here he was, at Star Farm.

[It's Not A Question Of “If” by The_sapphire_potterhead](https://archiveofourown.org/works/60455935)
> Muggles were mostly beneath wizards. Still, there were two things they were better at than wizards: homosexuality and BDSM. That was the reason former Death Eater and current heir to the Malfoy estate Draco Malfoy found himself in an establishment that had both. Imagine his surprise when he finds a particularly famous person he enters a fuck-buddy situation with from which a new love blossoms.

[Landscapes of Waiting by Ladderofyears, PollyWeasley](https://archiveofourown.org/works/18522886)
> Draco and Harry have been dating for over a year now. They are happy and very stable as a couple, but Draco is adamant on remaining a virgin until their wedding day. They are strong in this resolution, but it's hard when you're kinky and your boyfriend is so damn hot.

[Need You by youhavemyswordandbow](https://archiveofourown.org/works/57941770)

> 
> The other one is also blonde, and is definitely dead.

> In 2013, a carefully-designed Obliviation leaves Harry reconfiguring his life and identity without any memories of true love; an act that's essentially erased Draco Malfoy from his mind despite a wedding band and shared home.
> 
> In 2000, Draco had expected Pansy's relationship with Luna to bring the Gryffindors a bit closer to his orbit of quiet, carefully pacifistic existence, but he never expected to navigate such a transparent embrace into a unit of family, friendship, and love.
> 
> A mystery, two love stories, and a reminder that learning to love never has an end date.

[Fearful Trill by Vukovich](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34744045)

> 
> Draco should have got the Kiss. He should have died in Azkaban decades ago. Instead, guards throw him in a Ministry lift with a dying man who could stand to live a little.

First coffee of the new year.

Great aroma, literally smell smells like gingerbread cookies.

Very light mouth feel, but intense sweetness, the gingerbread was very prominent when it was piping hot, a lot of nutmeg, but as it cold, I can definitely taste the spiciness of the cloves. The finish was like a spicy red wine, with bready yeast as it cools. I actually think this would be a a great cold brew! I loved the aroma!! ",2,1735772103.0,pourover,2,0.75,False

1hrevxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hrevxh/its_never_too_early_to_get_our_kids_out_of_the/,It’s never too early to get our kids out of the church,"I left the church in 2021, when my kids were 9 and 7, respectively (my wife was already out). The oldest was never baptized and neither of them had really been to church for a couple years at that point due to the pandemic. As a result, they missed out on a lot of the early indoctrination that my wife and I went through growing up in the Mormon church.

That said, my oldest told us this week about a time several years ago when he snuck a sip of my wife’s coffee. According to him, for a long time afterward, he would lay awake at night worried about going to hell because of how bad the adults in primary said it was to drink coffee. He was FIVE when this happened.

I’ve always been glad we left before our kids could be baptized or given the priesthood, but this made me wish I had stopped taking them even earlier. It is never, ever too early to get our kids out of the church.
